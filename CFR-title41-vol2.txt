                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1
    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, July 1, 1998), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication 
in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and 
parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

          Subpart 101-2.1--Billings, Payments, and Adjustments


<R05>
Sec. 101-2.100  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart deals with the procedures and forms used by GSA in 
billing for supplies and services furnished Government agencies, and the 
procedures for payment and adjustment of these billings.


<R05>
Sec. 101-2.101  Background.

    (a) GSA provides supplies, equipment, services, space, 
communications, motor vehicles, printing, and other miscellaneous items 
for Government agencies on a reimbursable basis. These supplies and 
services are financed from revolving, management, or working funds, and 
reimbursement from agencies is obtained through periodic billings and 
collections intended to permit GSA to operate these programs with a 
minimum amount of appropriated capital.
    (b) The General Accounting Office Policy and Procedures Manual for 
Guidance of Federal Agencies, title 7, chapter 2, section 8.5, provides 
that billings from GSA shall be paid in accordance with regulations 
issued by GSA.
    (c) In providing for goods or services for Government agencies, GSA 
must, under certain regulations, provide for payment of the procurement 
to the vendors for the agencies. The payments are made by GSA without 
confirmation of actual receipt of the goods or services by the agencies. 
These procedures are essential to comply with the payment terms and 
conditions of the purchase order or contract and to earn cash discounts. 
The payments are made by GSA from revolving funds which are reimbursed 
from the agencies' appropriations and funds in accordance with Sec. 101-
2.103 or Sec. 101-2.105. The agency that ordered and received the goods 
or services is responsible for the voucher audit (matching of the 
purchase documents, evidence of receipt, and billing documents). If the 
receiving agency has not received the goods or services in accordance 
with purchase order or contract, it is the agency's responsibility to 
report the losses or discrepancies to GSA in accordance with Sec. 101-
2.106 so that GSA may obtain credit from the vendor for overpayments. 
Credit to the ordering agency will be made by GSA in these cases based 
upon the report from the agency, and a claim will be placed by GSA 
against the carrier or vendor for recovery.
[34 FR 8160, May 24, 1969, as amended at 42 FR 55811, Oct. 19, 1977; 43 
FR 21882, May 22, 1978]


<R05>
Sec. 101-2.102  Billing procedures.

    (a) Bills are rendered biweekly, monthly, or quarterly after the 
fact or in advance on approved billing forms, which are GSA Form 789, 
Statement, Voucher, and Schedule of Withdrawals and Credits, and 
Treasury TFS Form 7306, Paid Billing Statement for SIBAC Transactions 
(illustrated at Secs. 101-2.4902-789 and 101-2.4903-7306). Certification 
of such bills by GSA is not required. Except for those bills which are 
rendered in advance: bills for shipment from stock are rendered on the 
basis of drop from inventory, provided that notification of warehouse 
refusal or other advice of nonavailability has not been received from 
the depot prior to the

[[Page 13]]

billing date; bills for services are rendered after there is evidence of 
actual delivery of services; and bills for stock and nonstock direct 
delivery shipments are rendered based upon payment to the vendor. Non-
OPAC (On-Line Payment and Collection) bills, issued on GSA Form 789, 
comprised of the accumulation of small dollar invoices which do not 
reach the predetermined threshold amount, may be issued at the end of 
the quarter in which the threshold is reached. Exceptions are: Recurring 
and open-end Reimbursable Work Authorizations (RWA's) which will bill at 
the end of each fiscal year for any unpaid charges whether the threshold 
is reached or not; and non-recurring RWA's which will bill upon 
completion of the RWA if the threshold is not reached prior to that 
time.
    (b) GSA will not normally attach signed receipts to the bills for 
supporting documentation. Rather, documents or billing cards will 
generally be furnished which will contain the necessary information to 
permit the agency to identify its requisition, purchase order, travel 
order, or other obligating documents.
    (c) GSA may, at its discretion, process requisitions of $1 or less 
without billing. Therefore, any agency having such items unbilled 60 
days after receipt of the material may assume that they will not be 
billed and may cancel the obligation accordingly. In addition to billing 
agencies under the GSA Form 789 procedures as indicated in paragraphs 
(a) and (b), of this section, GSA also utilizes the Simplified 
Intragovernmental Billing and Collection (SIBAC) System.
    (d) The SIBAC system is prescribed by GSA as indicated within this 
subpart and by the Treasury Fiscal Requirements Manual for Guidance of 
Departments and Agencies, chapter 5000 of part VI. The basic concept 
underlying the SIBAC system is the elimination of governmental 
receivable and payables; reduction of paperwork; and improved cash flow. 
Two essential elements of the system are: It provides for immediate 
payment to the billing agency, and it provides a method by which 
recipient agencies may charge back erroneous charges billed.

Under this system immediate payment is accomplished by authorizing GSA 
as the billing agency to credit its own 8 digit pay station symbol and 
to charge the customer agency's 8-digit pay station symbol for services 
purchased or supplies shipped. This system also provides for chargebacks 
which are accomplished on the customer agency's SF 224, Statement of 
Transactions, by reporting the amount of erroneous charge to a clearing 
account of the billing agency after proper notification and 
documentation have been sent to the billing (SIBAC) agency. The system 
is applicable only when both the billing and customer agencies report 
their monthly transactions to the Department of the Treasury on SF 224, 
Statement of Transactions. GSA programs under the SIBAC system are as 
follows:
    (1) Billings to civil executive agencies for supplies from FSS 
supply distribution facilities for stock and nonstock direct deliveries 
are billed semimonthly at the GSA accounting centers. For motor pool 
services civil agencies are billed monthly at the centers. Billings to 
the Department of Defense (DOD) through the SIBAC system for supplies 
are contained in the DOD handbook, Military Standard Billing Systems 
(MILSBILLS) 4000.25-7-M. The basicdifference between the SIBAC System 
operated for civil executive agencies and DOD is the the GSA/DOD system 
operates with a direct charge by the billings agency to the 
appropriation or fund account of the customer agency's 8-digit station 
symbol.
    (2) The standard level user charges (SLUC) for space assignments are 
billed quarterly in advance, and actual adjustments are made quarterly 
in arrears.
[34 FR 8160, May 24, 1969, as amended at 42 FR 55811, Oct. 19, 1977; 46 
FR 50951, Oct. 16, 1981; 57 FR 56993, Dec. 2, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 101-2.103  SIBAC payment procedures.

    Under this system GSA is authorized to charge the 8-digit agency pay 
station symbol of the customer agencies for services purchased or 
supplies shipped.
    (a) Treasury TFS Form 7306 (illustrated at Sec. 101-2.4903-7306) 
will be used

[[Page 14]]

as the paid billing document in connection with this procedure. GSA as 
the SIBAC billing agency will attach supporting documentation only when 
the transaction cannot be adequately described on TFS Form 7306.
    (b) The paid billing statement shall be accounted for by the billed 
agency as an accomplished or paid document and reported on its current 
SF 224, Statement of Transactions (similar to reporting the charge side 
of SF 1081, Voucher and Schedule of Withdrawals and Credits). GSA as the 
SIBAC billing agency will report the credit received from these charges 
on its SF 224. Both sides of the transaction will be accomplished as of 
the payment date of the paid billing statement. Immediate payment is 
accomplished by authorizing GSA to credit its own 8-digit agency pay 
station symbol and to charge the billed agency's 8-digit pay station 
symbol for services purchased or supplies shipped.
[42 FR 55812, Oct. 19, 1977, as amended at 43 FR 21882, May 22, 1978]


<R05>
Sec. 101-2.104  SIBAC chargeback procedures.

    Agencies participating in the SIBAC system with GSA may utilize the 
chargeback procedure to obtain billing adjustments in accordance with 
the Treasury Fiscal Requirements Manual for Guidance of Departments and 
Agencies, part VI, chapter 5000; instructions contained in GSA Handbook, 
Discrepancies or Deficiencies in GSA or DOD Shipments, Material, or 
Billings (FPMR 101-26.8) or as outlined in Sec. 101-2.106. For DOD the 
appropriate advice codes contained in the DOD Handbook, MILSBILLS, 
4000.25-7-M, shall be used to request adjustments.
    (a) Agency finance and accounting activities in receipt of erroneous 
billings shall request authorization for chargebacks, by telephone, from 
the GSA SIBAC representatives identified on the TFS Form 7306.
    (b) Adjustments in billings involving discrepancies or deficiencies 
in shipments or material, vendor or carrier liability, or merchandise to 
be returned to GSA are not subject to the chargeback procedure. These 
will be reported to the GSA regional office which made or directed 
shipment of the material for investigation and resolution.
    (1) Chargebacks for supplies from the Federal Supply Service will 
not be authorized for any bills more than 1 year old from the date of 
the billing nor for items valued at $25 or less per line item on a bill 
as indicated in Sec. 101-2.106(c).
    (2) Agencies other than DOD shall submit documentation to the GSA 
billing office in support of the chargeback taken. The documentation 
shall consist of an SF 238, SIBAC Adjustment Voucher for Chargebacks, 
SIBAC detail line item billing card(s) covering items being charged back 
(when available), and a copy of the detail billing register (GSA Form 
952) with items that were charged back clearly annotated. Such 
documentation shall cite the authorization number provided by the GSA 
SIBAC representatives and for FSS supply billings, the appropriate 
Billing Adjustment Advice Code(s) contained in the GSA Handbook, 
Discrepancies or Deficiencies in GSA or DOD Shipments, Material, or 
Billings (FPMR 101-26.8).
    (3) Erroneous chargebacks will be rejected and/or rebilled.
[42 FR 55812, Oct. 19, 1977, as amended at 43 FR 21883, May 22, 1978]


<R05>
Sec. 101-2.105  Non-SIBAC payment procedures.

    (a) All GSA invoices or billings, including those representing 
partial shipment, shall be paid promptly by check or transfer document. 
This requirement is mandatory to (1) Assist GSA in managing its 
revolving fund operations with a minimum of appropriated capital; (2) 
reduce the cost of collection in GSA; and (3) reduce the cost of payment 
for other agencies. To expedite reimbursement and reduce the cost of 
billings and payments, agencies are requested to ensure that GSA bills 
are directed to the office authorized to make payment. This will avoid 
the costly and time-consuming handling of the bills at consignee and 
interminated offices.
    (b) Since the reimbursement requested are between Government 
agencies, bills shall be paid as rendered without preaudit or receipt 
verification, subject only to the availability of

[[Page 15]]

funds and adjustments for obvious significant errors in dollar amounts. 
The agencies are responsible for establishing an adequate followup 
system to ensure that goods and materials paid for are received.
    (c) Agencies may use GSA Form 789 (Illustrated at Sec. 101-2.4902-
789) in processing payments to GSA in all cases where disbursing offices 
can place the credit to the appropriate account without the transmittal 
of a check to the GSA billing office. The Department of the Treasury 
disburses payments for certain agency accounting stations; these 
stations shall send the original and two copies of the GSA Form 789 to 
the Treasury regional offices for processing in accordance with the 
instructions contained in Treasury Department Circular No. 495, Second 
Revision, Procedures Memorandum No. 1, as amended. Agencies making 
payments by check shall arrange for one copy of the GSA Form 789 to be 
transmitted with the check when it is forwarded to GSA.
[42 FR 55812, Oct. 19, 1977]


<R05>
Sec. 101-2.106  Adjustments.

    (a) Exceptions noted either at the time of payment or in postaudit 
(subject to the provisions of automatic adjustment procedures in 
paragraph (d) of this section, below) shall be brought to the attention 
of GSA either by notation on the billing statement or by separate 
communication. Approved adjustments will be reflected appropriately in 
subsequent billings.
    (b) Agencies shall notify GSA immediately of discrepancies or 
deficiencies in shipments or nonreceipt of shipments so that appropriate 
action may be taken. The discrepancies or deficiencies shall be 
submitted to the GSA office which made or directed shipment in 
accordance with GSA Handbook, Discrepancies or Deficiencies in GSA or 
DOD Shipments, Material, or Billings (FPMR 101-26.8).
    (c) Adjustments of billings or payments for supplies or services are 
not required and should not be requested or made whenever the difference 
involved resulting from over or under deliveries or over or under 
charges is $25 or less on any line item on a bill or for any bills more 
than 1 year old from the date of billing. This shall not be construed to 
eliminate billings and payments for requisitioned items of $25 or less. 
In connection with GSA Federal Supply Service activities, subpart 101-
26.8 is applicable to adjustments for discrepancies or deficiencies in 
shipments of materials. To minimize followup, research, and collection 
costs on intragovernmental transactions, agencies are urged to follow 
the most liberal policy possible in determining whether to request 
adjustment. To further expedite settlement of accounts between GSA and 
the billed agencies, such settlement may be made by mutual agreement, 
regardless of amount, without reference to the General Accounting 
Office.
    (d) Adjustments of billings or payments for supplies or services of 
$25 or less explained in paragraph (c) of this section do not apply to 
reimbursable commercial toll charges in the Federal Telecommunications 
(FT) Fund. However, each agency head shall be responsible for 
establishing controls over the use of telephones adequate for ensuring 
that long distance telephone calls are made only when they are the most 
economical and practicable means of communications available for 
transaction of Government business. Such controls should also ensure 
that commercial telephone facilities are used only when Government-owned 
or -leased facilities are not available or when commercial telephone 
facilities are more economical than Government-owned or -leased 
facilities (7 GAO 25-3). Agencies are responsible for establishing an 
adequate followup system to determine if any toll charges were 
unofficial or uncertifiable. In the event the billing contains charges 
of this nature, the department or agency shall:
    (1) Investigate and recover from the individual the amount of such 
charges;
    (2) Take appropriate disciplinary action against individuals making 
unauthorized unofficial calls; and
    (3) Refer to GSA all uncertifiable calls remaining in doubt after 
the above procedures have been carried out with a written statement that 
investigation does not substantiate either payments pursuant to 31 
U.S.C. 680a or further collection efforts by the department, 
establishment, or agency.

[[Page 16]]


Upon receipt of the above statement for uncertifiable calls, GSA will 
refer these charges to the telephone company for adjustment and provide 
credit to the agency.
    (e) Credit adjustments for authorized return sales will be issued by 
GSA upon receipt of the returned material. The credit will be included 
on the next bill issued.

<R05>
Sec. 101-2.107  Statements of account.

    A statement of account is mailed quarterly to each agency billed 
office for unpaid items outstanding on each major revolving fund of GSA. 
Agencies shall make appropriate notations on the statement regarding the 
status of each item classified as delinquent and return the statement to 
GSA.

                        Subpart 101-2.2--Advances


<R05>
Sec. 101-2.200  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart prescribes the procedures for providing advances of 
funds by agencies obtaining supplies and services from GSA to the 
revolving, management, or working funds operated by GSA.


<R05>
Sec. 101-2.201  Types of advances.


<R05>
Sec. 101-2.201-1  Advance of funds; insufficient capital.

    (a) Whenever GSA determines that the capital in a particular fund is 
insufficient to finance the general program needs for supplies and 
services to be requisitioned by agencies supported by a particular fund, 
the affected agencies will be advised of the amount requested to be 
deposited to the credit of the fund. Advances will be returned to the 
agencies by GSA when the need for them no longer exists.
    (b) When the amount to be advanced has been determined by mutual 
agreement, GSA will bill the requisitioning agency by means of Standard 
Form 1080, Voucher for Transfer Between Appropriations and/or Funds 
(illustrated at Sec. 101-2.4901-1080), accompanied where appropriate by 
Standard Form 1081, Voucher and Schedule of Withdrawal and Credits 
(illustrated at Sec. 101-2.4901-1081), in accordance with the General 
Accounting Office Policy and Procedures Manual for Guidance of Federal 
Agencies, title 7, chapter 2, section 8. Upon receipt in the agency, a 
cash transfer or payment by check, as appropriate, shall be accomplished 
in the normal manner.


<R05>
Sec. 101-2.201-2  Advance for specific services.

    Advance billings are rendered for the following transactions:
    (a) Quarterly advance bills are rendered for reimbursable space 
occupancy and related costs on GSA Form 743, Invoice for Rent 
(illustrated at Sec. 101-2.4902-743), at fixed rates per square foot 
based on estimated costs. Itemization of the elements of costs is not 
shown in the advance bill, nor is the bill adjusted to actual costs.
    (b) Bills rendered on GSA Form 740, Invoice for Job Order Work 
(illustrated at Sec. 101-2.4902-740), are normally based on actual costs 
after completion of the job, without itemization of the elements of 
costs. However, in the case of specific jobs of significant dollar size, 
advance bills may be rendered to avoid impairment of GSA working 
capital. In such instances, a final settlement will be made at 
completion of the job to adjust the billing to actual costs.


<R05>
Sec. 101-2.201-3  Advance of funds; mutual agreement.

    Whenever circumstances are such that the financing of prospective 
agency transactions through a fund by means of an advance is 
advantageous, even though the capital of the fund is adequate, the 
agency concerned and GSA may mutually agree to such financing of the 
transactions. This type advance may be necessary to provide financing 
for specific large dollar value transactions which otherwise may result 
in a temporary depletion of available cash. In these circumstances, the 
procedures for effecting payment shall be set forth in a letter of 
agreement.
    (a) The advances may be self-liquidating or for the duration of the 
circumstances requiring the advance. Self-liquidating advance agreements 
will generally provide that GSA will apply the amount of billings 
therefor

[[Page 17]]

directly against such advance, and that GSA will periodically render an 
accounting for the status of the advance to the agency concerned. Upon 
completion of the transaction, a settlement will be made between the two 
agencies to close out the transaction.
    (b) If the advance is not self-liquidating, the agreement will 
generally only provide for final settlement between the two agencies and 
return of all of the unliquidated portion of the advance.

Sec. 101-3.201  Reporting agency.

    Reports on real property owned by and leased to the United States 
shall be submitted by the agency responsible for the maintenance of real 
property records and accounts as prescribed by General Accounting Office 
principles and standards and illustrated in 2 GAO 1270 and 2 GAO 7030 
for owned property. For purposes of this inventory, the above rule shall 
apply regardless of the manner of acquisition or which agency is 
currently using the property. For example:
    (a) For general purpose buildings, such as office buildings or 
warehouses, which are occupied by a Federal agency or agencies upon 
determination by GSA, and for which GSA is responsible for elevator and 
guard service, and for cleaning and maintenance, GSA is the reporting 
agency.
    (b) For special purpose buildings, such as Coast Guard stations, 
military reservations, hospitals, and prisons, those agencies having 
control of building management and operation including authority to 
assign or reassign space in such buildings, will be considered as the 
reporting agencies.
    (c) For leased property, the agency currently administering the 
lease and making payments to the lessor, regardless of which agency 
executed the original lease or which agency is currently using the 
property.


<R05>

Sec. 101-5.100  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart states general policies, guidelines, and procedures for 
establishing centralized services in multioccupant Federal buildings.
[42 FR 35853, July 12, 1977]


<R05>
Sec. 101-5.101  Applicability.

    The regulations in this part apply to all executive agencies which 
occupy space in or are prospective occupants of multi-occupant Federal 
buildings located in the United States. In appropriate circumstances, 
the centralized services provided pursuant to this part are extended to 
agencies occupying other Federal buildings in the same geographical 
area. For purposes of this part, reference to Federal buildings may be 
deemed to include, when appropriate, leased buildings or specific leased 
space in a commercial building under the control of GSA.
[56 FR 33873, July 24, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 101-5.102  Definitions.

    (a) Centralized services means those central supporting and 
administrative services and facilities provided to occupying agencies in 
Federal buildings or nearby locations in lieu of each agency providing 
the same services or facilities for its own use. This includes those 
common administrative services provided by a Cooperative Administrative 
Support Unit (CASU). It does not include such common building features 
as cafeterias, blind stands, loading platforms, auditoriums, 
incinerators, or similar facilities. Excluded are interagency fleet 
management centers established pursuant to Public Law 766, 83d Congress, 
and covered by part 101-39 of this chapter.
    (b) Occupying agency means any Federal agency assigned space in a 
building or complex for which GSA has oversight of, or responsibility 
for the functions of operation and maintenance in addition to space 
assignment.
    (c) Cooperative Administrative Support Unit (CASU) means an 
organized mechanism for providing administrative

[[Page 23]]

services for agencies in multi-tenant federally occupied buildings.
[56 FR 33873, July 24, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 101-5.103  Policy.

    To the extent practicable, GSA will provide or arrange for the 
provision of centralized services whenever such services insure 
increased efficiency and economy to the Government without hampering 
program activities or essential internal administration of the agencies 
to be served.


<R05>
Sec. 101-5.104  Economic feasibility of centralized services.


<R05>
Sec. 101-5.104-1  General.

    GSA is currently providing various centralized services to Federal 
agencies in such fields as office and storage space, supplies and 
materials, communications, records management, transportation services, 
and printing and reprographics. Other centralized CASU's may be 
providing supporting services or activities such as health units, use of 
training devices and facilities, pistol ranges, and central facilities 
for receipt and dispatch of mail. Consolidation and sharing is 
frequently feasible with resulting economies in personnel, equipment, 
and space. Opportunities to effect economies through planned 
consolidation of such services occur particularly during the design 
stage of the construction of new Federal buildings, or the renovations 
to existing buildings. Opportunities may also occur as a result of needs 
assessments jointly conducted by local agencies.
[56 FR 33873, July 24, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 101-5.104-2  Basis for determining economic feasibility.

    (a) Whenever possible, determination of the economic feasibility of 
a proposed centralized service shall be based upon standard data on the 
relationship of the size of the Federal building, the number of 
occupants, location, and other factors pertinent to the type of 
centralized service being considered.
    (b) In the absence of standard data on which a determination of 
economic feasibility can be based, or where such data must be 
supplemented by additional factual information, a formal feasibility 
study may be made by GSA or a CASU workgroup, in coordination with local 
agencies to be involved, prior to a final determination to proceed with 
the furnishing of a centralized service. Generally, a formal feasibility 
study will be made only if provision of the proposed centralized service 
would involve the pooling of staff, equipment, and space which occupying 
agencies otherwise would be required to use in providing the service for 
themselves. Examples of centralized services which may require formal 
studies include printing and duplicating plants and similar facilities.
    (c) On the basis of experience under the centralized services 
program, GSA will develop criteria as to cost comparisons, production 
needs, building population, number of agencies involved, and other 
appropriate factors for consideration in determining the practicability 
of establishing various types of centralized services.
[30 FR 4199, Mar. 31, 1965, as amended at 56 FR 33874, July 24, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 101-5.104-3  Data requirements for feasibility studies.

    (a) The data requirements for feasibility studies may vary from 
program to program, but shall be standard within any single program. 
Such data shall disclose the costs resulting from provisions of the 
service on a centralized basis as compared to the same service provided 
separately by each occupying agency, including the costs of personnel 
assigned to provide the service, comparative space needs, equipment use, 
and any other pertinent factors.
    (b) Wherever feasible and appropriate, data will be secured directly 
from the prospective occupying agencies, subject to necessary 
verification procedures. Suitable standard formats and necessary 
instructions for submission of data will be prescribed in applicable

Sec. 101-5.104-4  Scheduling feasibility studies.

    The schedule of feasibility studies will be coordinated by GSA with 
its construction, space management, and buildings management programs. 
Before initiating the study, the Administrator of General Services, or 
his authorized designee, will give at least 30 days' notice to the head 
of each agency that would be served by the proposed centralized 
facility. Such notice will contain an indication of the cost elements 
involved and the general procedures to be followed in the study.


<R05>
Sec. 101-5.104-5  Designating agency representatives.

    The head of each agency receiving a GSA notice regarding a scheduled 
feasibility study will be requested to designate one or more officials 
at the location where the study will be made who may consult with 
authorized GSA representatives. Such information and assistance as is 
required or pertinent for an adequate review of the feasibility of the 
proposed centralized service shall be made available to GSA through the 
designated agency representatives.


<R05>
Sec. 101-5.104-6  Conduct  of  feasibility studies.

    An initial meeting of the representatives of prospective occupying 
agencies will be held to discuss the objectives and detailed procedures 
to be followed in the conduct of each feasibility study. Arrangements 
will be made at this meeting for securing all necessary data in 
accordance with Sec. 101-5.104-3.


<R05>
Sec. 101-5.104-7  Administrator's determination.

    (a) The Administrator of General Services will determine, on the 
basis of the feasibility study, whether provision of a centralized 
service meets the criteria for increased economy, efficiency, and 
service, with due regard to the program and internal administrative 
requirements of the agencies to be served. The Director of the Office of 
Management and Budget and the head of each agency affected will be 
advised of the Administrator's determination and of the reasons 
therefor. Each determination to provide a centralized service shall 
include a formal report containing an explanation of the advantages to 
be gained, a comparison of estimated annual costs between the proposed 
centralized operation and separate agency operations, and a statement of 
the date the centralized facility will be fully operational.
    (b) While a formal appeals procedure is not prescribed, any agency 
desiring to explain its inability to participate in the use of a 
centralized service may do so through a letter to the Director of the 
Office of Management and Budget, with a copy to the Administrator of 
General Services.

<R05>
Sec. 101-5.105  Operation of the centralized facility.

    (a) GSA will continually appraise the operation of centralized 
facilities to insure their continued justification in terms of economy 
and efficiency. Centralized services provided pursuant to the regulation 
may be discontinued or curtailed if no actual savings or operating 
improvements are realized after a minimum operating period of one year. 
Occupying agencies will be consulted regarding the timing of curtailment 
or discontinuance of any centralized services and the heads of such 
agencies notified at least 120 days in advance of each action.
    (b) Where mutual agreement is reached, an agency other than GSA may 
be designated by the Administrator of General Services to administer the 
centralized service.
    (c) Arrangements with regard to financing will conform to the 
special requirements of each type of centralized service and to existing 
law. Normally, reimbursement will be made for the use of established 
services except where the cost is nominal or where reimbursement may not 
be practicable.

Sec. 101-5.106  Agency committees.

    (a) Establishment. An occupying agency committee will be established 
by GSA if one does not exist, to assist the occupying agency, or such 
other agency as may be responsible, in the cooperative use of the 
centralized services,

[[Page 25]]

as defined in 101-5.102(a), provided in a Federal building. Generally, 
such a committee will be established when the problems of administration 
and coordination necessitate a formal method of consultation and 
discussion among occupying agencies.
    (b) Membership. Each occupying agency of a Federal building is 
entitled to membership on an agency committee. The chairperson of each 
such committee shall be a GSA employee designated by the appropriate GSA 
Regional Administrator, except when another agency had been designated 
to administer the centralized service. In this instance, the chairperson 
shall be an employee of such other agency as designated by competent 
authority within that agency.
    (c) Activities. Agency committees shall be advisory in nature and 
shall be concerned with the effectiveness of centralized services in the 
building. Recommendations of an agency committee will be forwarded by 
the chairman to the appropriate GSA officials for consideration and 
decision.
    (d) Reports. A resume of the minutes of each meeting of an agency 
committee shall be furnished to each member of the committee and to the 
appropriate GSA Regional Administrator.

[56 FR 33874, July 24, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 101-5.203-6  Pooling of equipment and personnel.

    (a) In establishing centralized reproduction facilities in Federal 
buildings or complexes, GSA's regional office will make arrangements 
with participating agencies for the transfer of duplicating and related 
equipment for the centralized plant. Equipment for which there is no 
foreseeable need in the centralized plant will not be transferred to the 
plant but will be disposed of or transferred by the owning agency out of 
the centralized plant. Copy processing machines, as provided in 
paragraph (b) of this section, as well as reproduction, addressing, and 
automatic-copy processing equipment used in bona fide systems 
applications may be retained by mutual agreement with user agencies.
    (b) All copy-processing machines having a maximum speed of 25 copies 
a minute or less are exempted from transfer to the centralized plant, 
subject to the following conditions:
    (1) No automatic document feeders, sorting mechanisms, or similar 
devices that encourage the use of the copier as a duplicating machine 
will be permitted, except in certified bona fide systems applications 
approved in advance by GSA.
    (2) All purchase orders for new copying equipment or for 
continuation of existing equipment shall be submitted to the centralized 
facility manager for approval prior to release to the vendor.
    (3) Exempted copiers, other than in bona fide systems applications 
provided in this Sec. 101-5.203-6, are to be used for making not more 
than 20 copies of any one original. Requirements for more than 20 copies 
shall be submitted to the centralized facility for reproduction.
    (4) The centralized facility manager shall periodically inspect 
agency copiers to ensure compliance with the terms of the exemption 
provisions. Following such inspections, action shall be taken first at 
the local level, then, if necessary, at the headquarters level, to 
promptly remove any unauthorized equipment, attachments, and devices not 
in consonance with these provisions.
    (c) Personnel devoting over 50 percent of time to the duplicating 
activities of the affected agency will be identified for transfer to the 
operating agency upon establishment of a centralized plant, in 
accordance with the Office of Personnel Management regulations relating 
to the transfer of functions. Agencies will transfer personnel ceiling 
to the operating agency for employees so transferred. In the event of

[[Page 27]]

later disestablishment of the centralized facility or substantial 
reduction in operations thereof, personnel ceiling will be returned to 
the agencies from which originally received.
    (d) Exceptions to pooling of equipment to meet the individual agency 
programmatic need, special physical security needs, confidentiality 
requirements, and/or certain quality standards will be made available to 
occupant agencies when use of such equipment is justified. Each agency 
must provide justification for approval of the GSA regional printing and 
distribution activity before acquiring space and/or electrical service 
from the building's manager. Otherwise, as agreed by the user agencies, 
GSA will not make available space for duplicating equipment, or provide 
other support services for such equipment in Federal buildings where use 
of that equipment would duplicate the services provided by the 
centralized services plant.

            Subpart 101-5.3--Federal Employee Health Services

    Authority: Chapter 865, 60 Stat. 903; 5 U.S.C. 7901.

    Source: 30 FR 12883, Oct. 9, 1965, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 101-5.300  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart 101-5.3 states the objective, guiding principles, 
criteria, and general procedures in connection with the establishment 
and operation of Federal employee health services in buildings managed 
by GSA.


<R05>
Sec. 101-5.301  Applicability.

    This subpart 101-5.3 is applicable to all Federal agencies which 
occupy space in or are prospective occupying agencies of a building or 
group of adjoining buildings managed by GSA.


<R05>
Sec. 101-5.302  Objective.

    It is the objective of GSA to provide or arrange for appropriate 
health service programs in all Government-owned and leased buildings, or 
groups of adjoining buildings, which it manages where the building 
population warrants, where other Federal medical facilities are not 
available, and, where the number of the occupying agencies indicating a 
willingness to participate in such a program on a reimbursable basis 
makes it financially feasible.


<R05>
Sec. 101-5.303  Guiding principles.

    The following principles will control the scope of the health 
services to be provided in keeping with the objective:
    (a) Employees who work in groups of 300 or more, counting employees 
of all departments or agencies who are scheduled to be on duty at one 
time in the same building or group of buildings in the same locality 
will constitute the minimum number of employees required to warrant the 
establishment of a health service of a scope specified in Sec. 101-
5.304.

[[Page 29]]

    (b) As an exception to paragraph (a) of this section, health 
services of the scope specified in Sec. 101-5.304 may be provided for 
employees who work in groups of less than 300 where the employing 
department or agency determines that working conditions involving 
unusual health risks warrant such provision.
    (c) Treatment and medical care in performance-of-duty cases will be 
provided to employees as set forth in the Federal Employees' 
Compensation Act (5 U.S.C. 751 et seq.).
    (d) Reimbursable costs for providing health services will be based 
on an operating budget which is a summary of all costs required to 
operate the health service. The reimbursement cost is prorated to 
participating agencies by means of a per capital formula computed by 
dividing the operating budget of the health service by the total number 
of employees sponsored for service. The size of the Federal population 
served, the compensation of the employees of the health unit, and other 
factors of medical economics prevalent in the area are factors which 
affect the local reimbursement cost. Further, in appropriate cases where 
more than one health unit is servicing employees housed in the same 
general locality, costs may be equalized by combining the operating 
budgets of all such units and dividing the total of the operating 
budgets by the number of employees sponsored. Special industrial 
conditions or othe abnormal health or accident risk environments may 
increase the per capita cost.
[30 FR 12883, Oct. 9, 1965, as amended at 35 FR 6651, Apr. 25, 1970]


<R05>
Sec. 101-5.304  Type of occupational health services.

    The type of occupational health services made available to occupying 
agencies will be as follows:
    (a) Emergency diagnosis and first treatment of injury or illness 
that become necessary during working hours and that are within the 
competence of the professional staff and facilities of the health 
service unit, whether or not such injury was sustained by the employee 
while in the performance of duty or whether or not such illness was 
caused by his employment. In cases where the necessary first treatment 
is outside the competence of the health service staff and facilites, 
conveyance of the employee to a nearby physician or suitable community 
medical facility may be provided at Government expense at the request 
of, or on behalf of, the employee.
    (b) Preemployment examinations of persons selected for appointment.
    (c) Such inservice examinations of employees as the participating 
agency determines to be necessary, such as voluntary employee health 
maintenance examinations which agencies may request for selected 
employees. Such examinations may be offered on a limited formula plan to 
all participating agencies when the resources of the health service 
staff and facilities will permit. Alternatively, when agencies are 
required to limit the cost of an occupational health services program, 
the provision of inservice examinations may be provided to selected 
employees of individual agencies and reimbursed on an individual basis.
    (d) Administration, in the discretion of the responsible health 
service unit physician, of treatments and medications
    (1) Furnished by the employee and prescribed in writing by his 
personal physician as reasonably necessary to maintain the employee at 
work, and
    (2) Prescribed by a physician providing medical care in performance-
of-duty injury or illness cases under the Federal Employees' 
Compensation Act.
    (e) Preventive services within the competence of the professional 
staff
    (1) To appraise and report work environment health hazards as an aid 
in preventing and controlling health risks;
    (2) To provide health education to encourage employees to maintain 
personal health; and
    (3) To provide specific disease screening examinations and 
immunizations.
    (f) In addition, employees may be referred, upon their request, to 
private physicians, dentists, and other community health resources.

Sec. 101-5.305  Agency participation.

    At the time the space requirements for a building or a group of 
adjoining buildings are developed by GSA, the prospective occupying 
agencies will be canvassed by GSA to determine if they wish to 
participate in the occupational health services program. Each agency 
desiring to participate in the program will be requested to furnish GSA 
with a written commitment, signed by an authorized official, that it is 
prepared to reimburse GSA, or such other agency as is designated 
pursuant to Sec. 101-5.105(b), on a yearly per capita basis for each of 
its employees housed in the building or buildings covered by the 
program.


<R05>
Sec. 101-5.306  Economic feasibility.

    (a) The studies by GSA which lead to the development of space 
requirements and the determinations made as the result thereof will 
constitute the feasibility studies and the Administrator's determination 
contemplated by Sec. 101-5.104.
    (b) Each determination to provide health services will be governed 
by the principles stated in Sec. 101-5.303 and will be in consonance 
with the general standards and guidelines furnished Federal agencies by 
the Public Health Service of the Department of Health, Education, and 
Welfare.


<R05>
Sec. 101-5.307  Public Health Service.

    (a) The only authorized contact point for assistance of and 
consultation with the Public Health Service is the Federal Employee 
Health Programs, Division of Hospitals, Public Health Service, 
Washington, DC 20201. Other Federal agencies may be designated by the 
GSA Regional Administrator, pursuant to Sec. 101-5.105(b) to operate 
occupational health services. Designated agencies should contact the 
Public Health Service directly on all matters dealing with the 
establishment and operation of these services.
    (b) Public Health Service should be consulted by the designated 
agency on such matters as types, amounts, and approximate cost of 
necessary equipment; the scope of the services to be provided if it is 
affected by the amount of space and number of building occupants; types 
and amounts of supplies, materials, medicines, etc., which should be 
stocked; and the approximate cost of personnel staffing in cases where 
this method of operation is chosen, etc. PHS should also be asked to 
develop and monitor standards under which each health unit would be 
operated.

<R05>
Sec. 101-6.201  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart provides the regulations of the General Services 
Administration (GSA) under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (52 
U.S.C. 2000d--2000d-4) concerning nondiscrimination in federally 
assisted programs in connection with which Federal financial assistance 
is extended under laws administered in whole or in part by GSA.
[38 FR 17973, July 5, 1973]


<R05>
Sec. 101-6.202  Purpose.

    The purpose of this subpart is to effectuate the provisions of title 
VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (hereinafter referred to as the 
``Act'') to the end that no person in the United States shall, on the 
ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from 
participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected 
to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal 
financial assistance from GSA.


<R05>
Sec. 101-6.203  Application of subpart.

    (a) Subject to paragraph (b) of this section, this subpart applies 
to any program for which Federal financial assistance is authorized 
under a law administered in whole or in part by GSA, including the laws 
listed in Sec. 101-6.217. It applies to money paid, property 
transferred, or other Federal financial assistance extended to any such 
program after the effective date of this subpart pursuant to an 
application approved prior to such effective

[[Page 33]]

date. This subpart does not apply to (1) Any Federal financial 
assistance by way of insurance or guaranty contracts, (2) money paid, 
property transferred, or other assistance extended to any such program 
before the effective date of this subpart, except to the extent 
otherwise provided by contract, (3) any assistance to any individual who 
is the ultimate beneficiary under any such program, or (4) any 
employment practice, under any such program, of any employer, employment 
agency, or labor organization, except to the extent described in 
Sec. 101-6.204-2(d). The fact that a statute which authorizes GSA to 
extend Federal financial assistance to a program or activity is not 
listed in Sec. 101-6.217 shall not mean, if title VI of the Act is 
otherwise applicable, that such program is not covered. Other programs 
involving statutes now in force or hereinafter enacted may be added to 
this list by notice published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The regulations issued by the following Departments pursuant to 
title VI of the Act shall be applicable to the programs involving 
Federal financial assistance of the kind indicated, and those 
Departments shall respectively be responsible for determining and 
enforcing compliance therewith:
    (1) Department of Health, Education, and Welfare--donation or 
transfer of surplus property for purposes of education or public health 
(Sec. 101-6.217 (a)(2) and (b)).
    (2) Department of Defense--donation of surplus personal property for 
purposes of civil defense (Sec. 101-6.217(a)(2)).
    (3) Department of Transportation--donation of property for public 
airport purposes (Sec. 101-6.217(c)). GSA will, however, be responsible 
for obtaining such assurances as may be required in applications and in 
instruments effecting the transfer of property.
    (4) Department of the Interior--disposal of surplus real property, 
including improvements, for use as a public park, public recreational 
area, or historic monument (Sec. 101-6.217(d) (1) and (2)). GSA will, 
however, be responsible for obtaining such assurances as may be required 
in applications and in instruments effecting the transfer of property 
for use as a historic monument.
    (5) Department of Housing and Urban Development--disposal of surplus 
real property for use in the provision of rental or cooperative housing 
to be occupied by families or individuals of low or moderate income 
(Sec. 101-6.217(q)).
    (c) Each Department named in paragraph (b) of this section shall 
keep GSA advised of all compliance and enforcement actions, including 
sanctions imposed or removed, taken by it with respect to the programs 
specified in paragraph (b) of this section to which the regulations of 
such Department apply.

Sec. 101-6.204  Discrimination prohibited.


<R05>
Sec. 101-6.204-1  General.

    No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, 
or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the 
benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination under any 
program to which this subpart applies.


<R05>
Sec. 101-6.204-2  Specific discriminatory actions prohibited.

    (a)(1) In connection with any program to which this subpart applies, 
a recipient may not, directly or through contractual or other 
arrangements, on the ground of race, color, or national origin:
    (i) Deny an individual any service, financial aid, or other benefit 
provided under the program;
    (ii) Provide any service, financial aid, or other benefit to an 
individual which is different, or is provided in a different manner, 
from that provided to others under the program;
    (iii) Subject an individual to segregation or separate treatment in 
any matter related to his receipt of any service, financial aid, or 
other benefit under the program;
    (iv) Restrict an individual in any way in the enjoyment of any 
advantage or privilege enjoyed by others receiving any service, 
financial aid, or other benefit under the program;
    (v) Treat an individual differently from others in determining 
whether he satisfies any admission, enrollment, quota, eligibility, 
membership or other

[[Page 34]]

requirement or condition which individuals must meet in order to be 
provided any service, financial aid, or other benefit provided under the 
program;
    (vi) Deny an individual an opportunity to participate in the program 
through the provision of services or otherwise, or afford him an 
opportunity to do so which is different from that afforded others under 
the program (including the opportunity to participate in the program as 
an employee but only to the extent set forth in paragraph (d) of this 
Sec. 101-6.204-2).
    (2) A recipient, in determining the types of services, financial 
aid, or other benefits, or facilities which will be provided under any 
such program, or the class of individuals to whom, or the situations in 
which, such services, financial aid, other benefits, or facilities will 
be provided under any such program, or the class of individuals to be 
afforded an opportunity to participate in any such program, may not, 
directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria 
or methods of administration which have the effect of subjecting 
individuals to discrimination because of their race, color, or national 
origin, or have the effect of defeating or substantially impairing 
accomplishment of the objectives of the program as respect individuals 
of a particular race, color, or national origin.
    (3) In determining the site or location of facilities, an applicant 
or recipient may not make selections with the purpose or effect of 
excluding individuals from, denying them the benefits of, or subjecting 
them to discrimination under any program to which this subpart applies, 
on the ground of race, color, or national origin or with the purpose or 
effect of defeating or substantially impairing the accomplishment of the 
objectives of the Act or this subpart.
    (4) This subpart does not prohibit the consideration of race, color, 
or national origin if the purpose and effect are to remove or overcome 
the consequences of practices or impediments which have restricted the 
availability of, or participation in, the program or activity receiving 
Federal financial assistance, on the ground of race, color, or national 
origin. Where previous discriminatory practice or usage tends, on the 
ground of race, color, or national origin, to exclude individuals from 
participation in, to deny them the benefits of, or to subject them to 
discrimination under any program or activity to which this subpart 
applies, the applicant or recipient has an obligation to take reasonable 
action to remove or overcome the consequences of the prior 
discriminatory practice or usage, and to accomplish the purposes of the 
Act.
    (b) As used in this Sec. 101-6.204-2 the services, financial aid, or 
other benefits provided under a program receiving Federal financial 
assistance shall be deemed to include any service, financial aid, or 
other benefit provided in or through a facility provided with the aid of 
Federal financial assistance.
    (c) The enumeration of specific forms of prohibited discrimination 
in this Sec. 101-6.204-2 does not limit the generality of the 
porhibition in Sec. 101-6.204-1.
    (d)(1) Where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance 
to a program to which this subpart applies is to provide employment, a 
recipient may not, directly or through contractual or other 
arrangements, subject an individual to discrimination on the ground of 
race, color, or national origin in its employment practices under such 
program (including, but not limited to, recruitment or recruitment 
advertising; employment; layoff or termination; upgrading, demotion, or 
transfer; rates of pay or other forms of compensation; selection for 
training, including apprenticeship; and use of facilities). The 
requirements applicable to construction employment under any such 
program shall be those specified in or pursuant to part III of Executive 
Order 11246 or the corresponding provisions of any Executive order which 
supersedes it.
    (2) Where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance is 
not to provide employment, but discrimination on the ground of race, 
color, or national origin in the employment practices of the recipient 
or other persons subject to this subpart tends, on the ground of race, 
color, or national origin, to exclude individuals from participation in, 
to deny them the benefits of, or to subject them to discrimination under 
any program to which this

[[Page 35]]

subpart applies, the provisions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section 
shall apply to the employment practices of the recipient or other 
persons subject to this subpart, to the extent necessary to insure 
equality of opportunity to, and nondiscriminatory treatment of, 
beneficiaries.

<R05>
Sec. 101-6.204-3  Special programs.

    An individual shall not be deemed subjected to discrimination by 
reason of his exclusion from the benefits of a program limited by 
Federal law to individuals of a particular race, color, or national 
origin different from his.


<R05>
Sec. 101-6.205  Assurances required.


<R05>
Sec. 101-6.205-1  General.

    (a) Every application for Federal financial assistance to carry out 
a program to which this subpart 101-6.2 applies, except a program to 
which Sec. 101-6.205-2 applies, and every application for Federal 
financial assistance to provide a facility shall, as a condition to its 
approval and the extension of any Federal financial assistance pursuant 
to the application, contain or be accompanied by an assurance that the 
program will be conducted or the facility operated in compliance with 
all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this subpart 101-6.2. In the 
case of an application for Federal financial assistance to provide real 
property or structures thereon, the assurance shall obligate the 
recipient, or, in the case of a subsequent transfer, the transferee, for 
the period during which the real property or structures are used for a 
purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for 
another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits. 
In the case of personal property, the assurance shall obligate the 
recipient for the period during which he retains ownership or possession 
of the property. In all other cases the assurance shall obligate the 
recipient for the period during which Federal financial assistance is 
extended pursuant to the application. The responsible GSA official shall 
specify the form of the foregoing assurances for each program and the 
extent to which like assurances will be required of subgrantees, 
contractors and subcontractors, transferees, successors in interest, and 
other participants in the program. Any such assurance shall include 
provisions which give the United States a right to seek its judicial 
enforcement.
    (b) In the case of real property, structures or improvements 
thereon, or interests therein, which is acquired with Federal financial 
assistance, or in the case where Federal financial assistance is 
provided in the form of a transfer of real property or interest therein 
from the Federal Government, the instrument effecting or recording the 
transfer shall contain a covenant running with the land assuring 
nondiscrimination for the period during which the real property is used 
for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or 
for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or 
benefits. Where no transfer of property is involved, but property is 
improved under a program of Federal financial assistance, the recipient 
shall agree to include such a covenant in any subsequent transfer of 
such property. Where the property is obtained from the Federal 
Government, such covenant may also include a condition coupled with a 
right to be reserved by GSA to revert title to the property in the event 
of a breach of the covenant where, in the discretion of the responsible 
GSA official, such a condition and right of reverter is appropriate to 
the program under which the real property is obtained and to the nature 
of the grant and the grantee. In such event, if a transferee of real 
property proposes to mortgage or otherwise encumber the real property as 
security for financing construction of new, or improvement of existing, 
facilities on such property for the purposes for which the property was 
transferred, the Administrator may agree, upon request of the transferee 
and if necessary to accomplish such financing, and upon such conditions 
as he deems appropriate, to forebear the exercise of such right to 
revert title for so long as the lien of such mortgage or other 
encumberance remains effective.
    (c) The assurance required in the case of a transfer of personal 
property shall

[[Page 36]]

be inserted in the instrument effecting the transfer of the property.
    (d) In the case of programs not involving a transfer of property, 
the assurance required shall be inserted in the agreement executed 
between the United States and the recipient covering the extension of 
Federal financial assistance.

<R05>
Sec. 101-6.205-2  Continuing State programs.

    Every application by a State or a State agency to carry out a 
program involving continuing Federal financial assistance to which this 
subpart applies shall as a condition to its approval and the extension 
of any Federal financial assistance pursuant to the application (a) 
contain or be accompanied by a statement that the program is (or, in the 
case of a new program, will be) conducted in compliance with all 
requirements imposed by or pursuant to this subpart, and (b) provide or 
be accompanied by provision for such methods of administration for the 
program as are found by the responsible GSA official to give reasonable 
assurance that the applicant and all recipients of Federal financial 
assistance under such program will comply with all requirements imposed 
by or pursuant to this subpart.
[38 FR 17974, July 5, 1973]


<R05>
Sec. 101-6.205-3  Elementary and secondary schools.

    The requirements of Secs. 101-6.205-1 and 101-6.205-2 with respect 
to any elementary or secondary school or school system shall be deemed 
to be satisfied if such school or school system (a) Is subject to a 
final order of a court of the United States for the desegregation of 
such school or school system, and provides an assurance that it will 
comply with such order, including any future modification of such order, 
or (b) submits a plan for the desegregation of such school or school 
system which the responsible official of the Department of Health, 
Education, and Welfare determines is adequate to accomplish the purposes 
of the Act and this subpart within the earliest practicable time, and 
provides reasonable assurance that it will carry out such plan. In any 
case of continuing Federal financial assistance such responsible 
official may reserve the right to redetermine, after such period as may 
be specified by him, the adequacy of the plan to accomplish the purposes 
of the Act and this subpart. In any case in which a final order of a 
court of the United States for the desegregation of such school or 
school system is entered after submission of such a plan, such plan 
shall be revised to conform to such final order, including any future 
modification of such order.
[38 FR 17974, July 5, 1973]


<R05>
Sec. 101-6.205-4  Applicability of assurances.

    (a) In the case of any application for Federal financial assistance 
to an institution of higher education, the assurance required by this 
Sec. 101-6.205 shall extend to admission practices and to all other 
practices relating to the treatment of students.
    (b) The assurance required with respect to an institution of higher 
education, hospital, or any other institution, insofar as the assurance 
relates to the institution's practices with respect to admission or 
other treatment of individuals as students, patients, or clients of the 
institution or to the opportunity to participate in the provision of 
services or other benefits to such individuals, shall be applicable to 
the entire institution unless the applicant establishes, to the 
satisfaction of the responsible GSA official, that the institution's 
practices in designated parts or programs of the institution will in no 
way affect its practices in the program of the institution for which 
Federal financial assistance is sought, or the beneficiaries of or 
participants in such program. If in any such case the assistance sought 
is for the construction of a facility or part of a facility, the 
assurance shall in any event extend to the entire facility and to 
facilities operated in connection therewith.
    (c) Where an installation or facility (for example, a public 
airport, or park or recreation area) is comprised of real property for 
which application is made under a program, and, in addition, other real 
property of the applicant,

[[Page 37]]

the assurance required under this Sec. 101-6.205 shall be applicable to 
the entire installation or facility.


<R05>
Sec. 101-6.206  Illustrative applications.

    The following examples will illustrate the application of the 
foregoing provisions of this subpart to certain programs for which 
Federal financial assistance is extended by GSA (in all cases the 
discrimination prohibited is discrimination on the ground of race, 
color, or national origin, prohibited by title VI of the Act and this 
subpart):
    (a) In the programs involving the transfer of surplus property for 
airport, park or recreation, historic monument, wildlife conservation, 
or street widening purposes (Sec. 101-6.217(c), (d), (e), and (h)), the 
public generally is entitled to the use of the facility and to receive 
the services provided by the facility and to facilities operated in 
connection therewith, without segregation or any other discriminatory 
practices.
    (b) In the program involving the loan of machine tools to nonprofit 
institutions or training schools (Sec. 101-6.217(o)), discrimination by 
the recipient in the admission of students or trainees or in the 
treatment of its students or trainees in any aspect of the educational 
process is prohibited. In the case of an institution of higher 
education, the prohibition applies to the entire institution except as 
provided in paragraph (b) of Sec. 101-6.205-4. In the case of elementary 
or secondary schools, the prohibition applies to all elementary and 
secondary schools of the recipient school district, consistent with 
Sec. 101-6.205-3. In this and other illustrations the prohibition of 
discrimination in the treatment of students or trainees includes the 
prohibition of discrimination among the students or trainees in the 
availability or use of any academic, dormitory, eating, recreational, or 
other facilities of the recipient.
    (c) In the programs involving the donation of personal property to 
public bodies or the American National Red Cross (Sec. 101-6.217 (f) and 
(j)), discrimination in the selection or treatment of individuals to 
receive or receiving the benefits or services of the program is 
prohibited.
    (d) In the program involving the donation of personal property to 
eleemosynary institutions (Sec. 101-6.217(1)), the assurance will apply 
to applicants for admission, patients, interns, residents, student 
nurses, and other trainees, and to the privilege of physicians, 
dentists, and other professionally qualified persons to practice in the 
institution, and will apply to the entire institution and to facilities 
operated in connection therewith, subject to the provisions of Sec. 101-
6.205-4(b).
    (e) In the programs involving the allotment of space by GSA to 
Federal Credit Unions, without charge for rent or services, and the 
provision of free space and utilities for vending stands operated by 
blind persons (Sec. 101-6.217 (i) and (k)), discrimination by 
segregation or otherwise in providing benefits or services is 
prohibited.
    (f) In the program involving grants to State and local agencies and 
to nonprofit organizations and institutions for the collecting, 
describing, preserving, and compiling and publishing of documentary 
sources significant to the history of the United States (Sec. 101-
6.217(n)), discrimination by the recipient in the selection of students 
or other participants in the program, and, with respect to educational 
institutions, in the admission or treatment of students, is prohibited.
    (g) In the program involving the transfer of surplus real property 
for use in the provision of rental or cooperative housing to families or 
individuals of low or moderate income (Sec. 101-6.217(q)), 
discrimination in the selection and assignment of tenants is prohibited.
    (h) A recipient may not take action that is calculated to bring 
about indirectly what this subpart forbids it to accomplish directly.
    (i) In some situations even though past discriminatory practices 
have been abandoned, the consequences of such practices continue to 
impede the full availability of a benefit. If the efforts required of 
the applicant or recipient under Sec. 101-6.209-4 to provide information 
as to the availability of the program or activity and the rights of 
beneficiaries under this subpart have failed to overcome these 
consequences, it will become necessary for such applicant or recipient 
to take additional

[[Page 38]]

steps to make the benefits fully available to racial and nationality 
groups previously subjected to discrimination. This action might take 
the form, for example, of special arrangements for obtaining referrals 
or making selections which will ensure that groups previously subjected 
to discrimination are adequately served.
    (j) Even though an applicant or recipient has never used 
discriminatory policies, the services and benefits of the program or 
activity it administers may not in fact be equally available to some 
racial or nationality groups. In such circumstances, an applicant or 
recipient may properly give special consideration to race, color, or 
national origin to make the benefits of its program more widely 
available to such groups not then being adequately served. For example, 
where a university is not adequately serving members of a particular 
racial or nationality group, it may establish special recruitment 
policies to make its program better known and more readily available to 
such group, and take other steps to provide that group with more 
adequate service.

    The responsible GSA official or his designee will make a prompt 
investigation whenever a compliance review, report, complaint, or any 
other information indicates a possible failure to comply with this 
subpart 101-6.2. The investigation should include, where appropriate, a 
review of the pertinent practices and policies of the recipient, the

will be resolved by informal means whenever possible. If it has been 
determined that the matter cannot be resolved by informal means, action 
will be taken as provided for in Sec. 101-6.211.
    (b) If an investigation does not warrant action pursuant to 
paragraph (a) of this section the responsible GSA official or his 
designee will so inform the recipient and the complainant, if any, in

noncompliance cannot be corrected by informal means, compliance with 
this subpart may be effected by the suspension or termination of or 
refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance or by any 
other means authorized by law. Such other means may include, but are not 
limited to, (a) a reference to the Department of Justice with a

requirement imposed by or pursuant to that section Federal financial 
assistance may be refused in accordance with the procedures of Sec. 101-

<R05>
Sec. 101-6.211-3  Termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance.

    No order suspending, terminating or refusing to grant or continue 
Federal financial assistance shall become effective until (a) the 
responsible GSA official has advised the applicant or recipient of his 
failure to comply and has determined that compliance cannot be

[[Page 40]]

secured by voluntary means, (b) there has been an express finding on the 
record, after opportunity for hearing, of a failure by the applicant or 
recipient to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to this 
subpart 101-6.2, (c) the action has been approved by the Administrator 
pursuant to Sec. 101-6.213-5, and (d) the expiration of 30 days after 
the Administrator has filed with the committee of the House and the 
committee of the Senate having legislative jurisdiction over the program 
involved, a full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for 
such action. Any action to suspend or terminate or to refuse to grant or 
to continue Federal financial assistance shall be limited to the 
particular political entity, or part thereof, or other applicant or 
recipient as to whom such a finding has been made and shall be limited 
in its effect to the particular program, or part thereof, in which such 
noncompliance has been so found.

    No action to effect compliance by an other means authorized by law 
shall be taken until (a) the responsible GSA official has determined 
that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means, (b) the recipient 
or other person has been notified of his failure to comply and of the 
action to be taken to effect compliance, and (c) the expiration of at 
least 10 days from the mailing of such notice to the recipient or other 
person. During this period of at least 10 days, additional efforts shall 
be made to persuade the recipient or other person to comply with this 
subpart and to take such corrective action as may be appropriate.

    Whenever an opportunity for a hearing is required by Sec. 101-6.211-
3, reasonable notice shall be given by registered or certified mail, 
return receipt requested, to the affected applicant or recipient. This 
notice shall advise the applicant or recipient of the action proposed to 
be taken, the specific provision under which the proposed action against 
it is to be taken, and the matters of fact or law asserted as the basis 
for this action, and either:
    (a) Fix a date not less than 20 days after the date of such notice 
within which the applicant or recipient may request of the responsible 
GSA official that the matter be scheduled for hearing, or (b) advise the 
applicant or recipient that the matter in question has been set down for 
hearing at a stated place and time. The time and place so fixed shall be 
reasonable and shall be subject to change for cause. The complainant, if 
any, shall be advised of the time and place of the hearing. An applicant 
or recipient may waive a hearing and submit written information and 
argument for the record. The failure of an applicant or recipient to 
request a hearing under this section or to appear at a hearing for which 
a date has been set shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to a 
hearing under section 602 of the Act and Sec. 101-6.211-3, and consent 
to the making of a decision on the basis of such information as is 
available.
    (b) [Reserved]

the responsible GSA official or, at his discretion, before a hearing 
examiner designated in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 3105 or 3344 (section 11 
of the Administrative Procedure Act).

with such rules of procedure as are proper (and not inconsistent with 
this section) relating to the conduct of the hearing, giving of notices 
subsequent to those provided for in Sec. 101-6.212-1, taking of 
testimony, exhibits, arguments and briefs, requests for findings, and 
other related matters. Both GSA and the applicant or recipient shall be 
entitled to introduce all relevant evidence on the issues as stated in 
the notice for hearing or as deterined by the officer conducting the 
hearing at the outset of or during the hearing.
    (b) Technical rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings 
conducted pursuant to this subpart 101-6.2, but rules or principles 
designed to assure production of the most credible evidence available 
and to subject testimony to test by cross-examination shall be applied 
where reasonably necessary by the officer conducting the hearing. The 
hearing officer may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly 
repetitious evidence. All documents and other evidence offered or taken 
for the record shall be open to examination by the parties and 
opportunity shall be given to refute facts and arguments advanced on 
either side of the issues. A transcript shall be made of the oral 
evidence except to the extent the substance thereof is stipulated for 
the record. All decisions shall be based upon the hearing record and 
written findings shall be made.

Sec. 101-6.212-5  Consolidated or joint hearings.

    In cases in which the same or related facts are asserted to 
constitute noncompliance with this subpart 101-6.2 with respect to two 
or more programs to which this subpart applies, or noncompliance with 
this subpart and the regulations of one or more other Federal 
departments or agencies issued under title VI of the Act, the 
Administrator may, by agreement with such other departments, or 
agencies, where applicable, provide for the conduct of consolidated or 
joint hearings, and for the application to such hearings of rules of 
procedure not inconsistent with this regulation. Final decisions in such 
cases, insofar as this subpart is concerned, shall be made in accordance

<R05>
Sec. 101-6.213-1  Decision by person other than the responsible GSA official.

    If the hearing is held by a hearing examiner such hearing examiner 
shall either make an initial decision, if so authorized, or certify the 
entire record including his recommended findings and proposed decision 
to the responsible GSA official for a final decision, and a copy of such 
initial decision or certification shall be mailed to the applicant or 
recipient. Where the initial decision is made by the hearing examiner 
the applicant or recipient may within 30 days of the mailing of such 
notice of initial decision file with the responsible GSA official his 
exceptions to the initial decision, with his reasons therefor. In the 
absence of exceptions, the responsible GSA official may on his own 
motion within 45 days after the initial decision serve on the applicant 
or recipient a notice that he will review the decision. Upon the filing 
of such exceptions or of such notice of review the responsible GSA 
official shall review the initial decision and issue his own decision 
thereon including the reasons therefor. In the absence of either 
exceptions or a notice of review the initial decision shall constitute 
the final decision of the responsible GSA official.

Sec. 101-6.213-2  Decisions on record or review by the responsible GSA official.

    Whenever a record is certified to the responsible GSA official for 
decision or he reviews the decision of a hearing examiner pursuant to 
Sec. 101-6.213-1, or whenever the responsible GSA official conducts the 
hearing, the applicant or recipient shall be given reasonable 
opportunity to file with him briefs or other written statements of its 
contentions, and a copy of the final decision of the responsible GSA 
official shall be given in writing to the applicant or recipient, and to 
the complainant, if any.


<R05>
Sec. 101-6.213-3  Decisions on record where a hearing is waived.

    Whenever a hearing is waived pursuant to Sec. 101-6.212 a decision

    Each decision of a hearing officer or responsible GSA official shall 
set forth his ruling on each finding, conclusion, or exception

Administrator) which provides for the suspension or termination of, or 
the refusal to grant or continue Federal financial assistance, or the 
imposition of any other sanction available under this subpart 101-6.2 or 
the Act, shall promptly be transmitted to the Administrator, who may 
approve such decision, may vacate it, or remit or mitigate any sanction 
imposed.


<R05>
Sec. 101-6.213-6  Content of orders.

    The final decision may provide for suspension or termination of, or 
refusal to grant or continue Federal financial assistance, in whole or 
in part, under the program involved, and may contain such terms, 
conditions, and other provisions as are consistent with and will 
effectuate the purposes of the Act and this subpart 101-6.2, including 
provisions designed to assure that no Federal financial assistance will 
thereafter be extended under such program to the applicant or recipient 
determined by such decision to be in default in its perfomrance of an 
assurance given by it pursuant to this subpart, or to have otherwise 
failed to comply with this subpart, unless and until it corrects its 
noncompliance and satisfies the responsible GSA official that it will 
fully comply with this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 101-6.213-7  Post termination proceedings.

    (a) An applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order issued 
under Sec. 101-6.213-6 shall be restored to full eligibility to receive 
Federal financial assistance if it satisfies the terms and conditions of 
that order for such eligibility or if it brings itself into compliance 
with this subpart and provides reasonable assurance that it will fully 
comply with this subpart. An elementary or secondary school or school 
system which is unable to file an assurance of compliance with Sec. 101-
6.24 shall be restored to full eligibility to receive financial 
assistance if it files a court order or a plan for desegregation meeting 
the requirements of Sec. 101-6.205-3 and provides reasonable assurance 
that it will comply with this court order or plan.
    (b) Any applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order 
entered pursuant to Sec. 101-6.213-6 may at any time request the 
responsible GSA official to restore fully its eligibility to receive 
Federal financial assistance. Any such request shall be supported by 
information showing that the applicant or recipient has met the 
requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. If the responsible GSA 
official determines that those requirements have been satisfied, he 
shall restore such eligibility.
    (c) If the responsible GSA official denies any such request, the 
applicant or recipient may submit a request, in writing, for a hearing, 
specifying why it believes such official to have been in error. It shall 
thereupon be given an expeditious hearing, with a decision on the 
record, in accordance with rules of procedure issued by the responsible 
GSA official. The applicant or recipient will be restored to such 
eligibilty if it proves at such a hearing that it satisfied the 
requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. While proceedings under 
this section are pending, the sanctions imposed by the order issued 
under Sec. 101-6.213-6 shall remain in effect.

discrimination is prohibited by this subpart, except that nothing in 
this subpart shall be deemed to relieve any person of any obligation 
assumed or imposed under any such superseded regulation, order,

                      Subpart 101-6.3--Ridesharing

    Authority: Sec. 205(c), 63 Stat. 390; 40 U.S.C. 486(c), Executive 
Order 12191 dated February 1, 1980.

    Source: 49 FR 20289, May 14, 1984, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 101-6.300  Federal facility ridesharing--general policy.

    This section sets forth policy and procedures governing promotion by 
executive agencies of ridesharing at federally owned or operated 
facilities and provides for the establishment and administration of a 
nationwide system of Federal facility employee transportation 
coordinators (ETC's). The authority for this subpart is Executive Order 
12191, dated February 1, 1980, which established the Federal Facility 
Ridesharing Program and delegated the

[[Page 46]]

primary responsibility for program development, implementation, and 
administration to the Administrator of General Services in consultation 
with the Secretary of Transportation.
    (a) Executive agencies shall actively promote the use of ridesharing 
at all Federal facilities. This promotion shall include cooperation with 
State and local ridesharing agencies where such agencies exist. In the 
process of promoting ridesharing, the Government shall not favor or 
endorse one commercial firm or nonprofit organization to the exclusion 
of other commercial firms or nonprofit organizations.
    (b) Each executive agency shall issue instructions as may be 
necessary to implement Federal facility ridesharing programs and to 
obtain annual ridesharing program reports at those facilities where the 
agency is responsible for providing the ETC. The information provided by 
each ETC should include methods used to promote ridesharing at his/her 
facility and any achievements or significant barriers encountered. Each 
executive agency shall maintain a current record of the names, titles, 
addresses, and telephone numbers of its facility ETC's, nationwide.
    (c) Agencies are required to submit a Federal Facility Ridesharing 
Report to GSA by June 1 of each year (see Sec. 101-6.303). The report 
shall contain a summary of the information provided by the facility 
ETC's and any other pertinent information applicable to the agency's 
ridesharing program.
    (d) Wherever possible, agencies shall use and promote existing 
ridematching services. Where ridematching services do not exist, they 
shall be established, preferably in conjunction with nearby facilities. 
Ridematching systems may be manual i.e., bulletin board or locator 
board, or computerized. All systems must comply with the provisions of 
the Privacy Act of 1974.
    (e) Wherever possible, agencies shall implement parking incentives 
which promote ridesharing and the efficient use of federally controlled 
parking areas. Agencies are also encouraged to work with private parking 
management concerns in or near Federal facilities to encourage the use 
of carpools and vanpools.
    (f) Whenever feasible, agencies should consider providing for 
flexibility in employee working hours to facilitate ridesharing 
arrangements.

<R05>
Sec. 101-6.301  Definitions.

    (a) Ridesharing. Sharing of the commute to and from work by two or 
more people, on a continuing basis, regardless of their relationship to 
each other, in any mode of transportation, including but not limited to: 
carpools, vanpools, buspools and mass transit.
    (b) Ridematching. Any manual or automated system that gathers 
commuter information from interested individuals and processes this 
information to identify potential ridesharing arrangements among these 
individuals.
    (c) Facility. Either a single building or a group of buildings or 
work locations at a common site.
    (d) Third party operator. A ridesharing agency or other 
organization, whether public or private, that leases vans or buses to 
employers or individual employees.
    (e) Federal facility employee transportation coordinator. An 
individual appointed by the agency who provides commuter ridesharing 
services to all employees at the facility and who serves as a point of 
contact for local and State ridesharing agencies, where they exist.
    (f) Agencywide employee transportation coordinator. An individual 
appointed by the agency, who is responsible for planning, organizing, 
and directing an agencywide ridesharing program, and serves as a point 
of contact for the agency's Federal facility ETC's and also as the 
ridesharing liaison between the agency and GSA.


<R05>
Sec. 101-6.302  Employee transportation coordinators.

    (a) Federal facility employee transportation coordinator. Agencies 
shall designate an ETC at each Federal facility with 100 or more full-
time employees on one shift. Agencies are encouraged to appoint 
coordinators at facilities with less than 100 full-time employees where 
such a coordinator can provide significant benefits to the ridesharing 
program. At a facility occupied by

[[Page 47]]

more than one Federal agency, the executive agency having the largest 
number of employees shall have the lead responsibility for program 
coordination and implementation for all the Federal agencies at the 
facility and shall provide the ETC for the facility. Should a smaller 
agency volunteer to provide the facility ETC, the lead agency may 
transfer this responsibility to the smaller agency. The Federal facility 
ETC shall:
    (1) Promote ridesharing at the facility by:
    (i) Publicizing the name, location, and telephone number of the 
employee transportation coordinator by using bulletin boards, memoranda, 
newsletters, etc.;
    (ii) Assisting employees in joining or forming carpools or vanpools;
    (iii) Aiding employee participation in ridematching programs (Where 
ridematching programs do not exist, action should be taken to establish 
them);
    (iv) Working closely with the parking management offices to promote 
ridesharing through preferential parking incentives;
    (v) Establishing ridesharing orientation for new and transferring 
employees at the facility;
    (vi) Utilizing ridesharing resources provided by State and local 
ridesharing agencies and participating in special ridesharing events;
    (vii) Publicizing the availability of public transportation;
    (viii) Communicating employee transportation needs to local public 
transportation authorities and other organizations (such as private bus 
companies) furnishing multipassenger modes of transportation; and
    (ix) Establishing ridesharing goals and objectives for the facility.
    (2) Prepare a facility report for annual submission to the 
agencywide coordinator.
    (b) Agencywide employee transportation coordinator. Agencies shall 
appoint an individual to serve as an agencywide ETC. The agencywide ETC 
shall:
    (1) Serve as a point of contact for the agency's facility ETC's;
    (2) Serve as a liaison between other agencywide ETC's, State, and 
local ridesharing agencies and the GSA Central Office;
    (3) Assist in the development and implementation of an agencywide 
ridesharing program; and
    (4) Submit promptly any change in the name, address, title, or 
telephone number of the agencywide ETC to GSA.


<R05>
Sec. 101-6.303  Reporting procedures.

    (a) The head of each agency shall submit to GSA by June 1 of each 
year a report which shall include:
    (1) The name, address, title, and telephone number of the agencywide 
ETC;
    (2) A narrative on actions taken and barriers encountered in

<R05>
Sec. 101-6.304  Exemptions.

    Facilities with less than 100 full-time employees or less than 100 
full-time employees on the largest shift are not required to submit an 
annual report. Agencies shall not subdivide buildings, groups of 
buildings, or worksites for the purpose of meeting the exemption 
standards.


<R05>
Sec. 101-6.305  Assistance to agencies.

    (a) Due to the large number of Federal, State, local and private 
sector groups involved in the promotion of ridesharing programs, there 
are various resources available to Federal agencies interested in 
technical assistance and promotional materials for use in their 
ridesharing programs. To aid agencies in identifying these resources, 
GSA has designated ridesharing coordinators at each of its regional 
offices. A

[[Page 48]]

list of these coordinators and information concerning the national 
program can be obtained by contacting the office listed in Sec. 101-
6.303(b).
    (b) Ridesharing management assistance is often available from local 
ridesharing agencies found in most cities throughout the country. These 
agencies may be sponsored by State or local governments, public 
transportation authorities, universities, Chambers of Commerce, Councils 
of Governments, etc. In addition to providing commuter matching 
services, these agencies have experience in local ridesharing promotion 
activities, vanpool and buspool programs, and are familiar with 
management of commuter disruptions such as transit strikes, bridge 
closings, as well as air pollution alerts. ETC's are encouraged to use 
the services of the local ridesharing agencies to the greatest extent 
possible.

 Subpart 101-6.4--Official Use of Government Passenger Carriers Between 
                    Residence and Place of Employment

    Source: 53 FR 26776, July 15, 1988, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 101-6.400  Scope and applicability.

    (a) All Federal agencies and entities, as defined in Sec. 101-
6.401(a), in the executive, judicial, and legislative branches of the 
Government are subject to this regulation, with the exception of the 
Senate, House of Representatives, Architect of the Capitol, and 
government of the District of Columbia.
    (b) This subpart applies to the use of home-to-work transportation 
for employees on normal duty (non-travel) status performing assigned 
duties at their place of employment. This subpart does not apply to the 
use of a Government passenger carrier when the passenger carrier is used 
in conjunction with official travel to perform temporary duty (TDY) 
assignments away from a designated or regular place of employment.
    (c) This subpart does not apply to those employees essential for the 
safe and efficient performance of intelligence, counterintelligence, 
protective services, or criminal law enforcement duties, when those 
employees have been so designated in writing by the head of a Federal 
agency. Each Federal agency which uses Government passenger carriers to 
perform such duties or services should issue guidance concerning the use 
of home-to-work transportation by its employees.


<R05>
Sec. 101-6.401  Definitions.

    For purposes of this regulation, the following definitions apply:
    (a) Federal agency means:
    (1) A department (as such term is defined in section 18 of the Act 
of August 2, 1946 (41 U.S.C. 5a));
    (2) An executive department (as such term is defined in 5 U.S.C. 
101);
    (3) A military department (as such term is defined in 5 U.S.C. 102);
    (4) A Government corporation (as such term is defined in 5 U.S.C. 
1031));
    (5) A Government controlled corporation (as such term is defined in 
5 U.S.C. 103(2));
    (6) A mixed-ownership Government corporation (as such term is 
defined in 31 U.S.C. 9101(2));
    (7) Any establishment in the executive branch of the Government 
(including the Executive Office of the President);
    (8) Any independent regulatory agency (including an independent 
regulatory agency specified in 44 U.S.C. 3502(10));
    (9) The Smithsonian Institution;
    (10) Any nonappropriated fund instrumentality of the United States; 
and
    (11) The United States Postal Service.
    (b) Head of agency means the highest official of a Federal agency.
    (c) Passenger carrier means a motor vehicle, aircraft, boat, ship, 
or other similar means of transportation that is owned or leased 
(including non-TDY rentals) by the United States Government, or has come 
into the possession of the Government by other means, including 
forfeiture or donation.
    (d) Employee means a Federal officer or employee of a Federal agency 
and includes an officer or enlisted member of the Armed Forces.
    (e) Residence means the primary place where an employee resides and 
from which the employee commutes to his/

[[Page 49]]

her place of employment. The term residence is not synonymous with 
domicile as that term is used for taxation or other purposes, nor does 
this regulation affect the provisions set forth in the Federal Travel 
Regulations for employees on temporary duty (TDY) away from their 
designated or regular place of employment.
    (f) Place of employment means any place within the accepted 
commuting area as determined by the agency for the locality involved, 
where an employee performs his/her business, trade, or occupation, even 
if the employee is there only for a short period of time. The term 
includes, but is not limited to, an official duty station, home base, 
headquarters, or any place where an employee is assigned to work, 
including locations where meetings, conferences, or other official 
functions take place.
    (g) Field work means official work performed by an employee whose 
job requires the employee's presence at various locations that are at a 
distance from the employee's place of employment (itinerant-type travel 
involving multiple stops within the accepted local commuting area, or 
use outside that area) or at a remote location that is accessible only 
by Government-provided transportation. The designation of a work site as 
a field office does not, of itself, permit the use of a Government 
passenger carrier for home-to-work transportation. (See Sec. 101-6.405.)
    (h) Clear and present danger means those highly unusual 
circumstances which present a threat to the physical safety of the 
employee's person or property under circumstances where:
    (1) The danger is--
    (i) Real, not imaginative, and
    (ii) Immediate or imminent, not merely potential; and
    (2) A showing is made that the use of a Government passenger carrier 
would provide protection not otherwise available.
    (i) Emergency means those circumstances which exist whenever there 
is an immediate, unforeseeable, temporary need to provide home-to-work 
transportation for those employees who are necessary to the 
uninterrupted performance of the agency's mission. An emergency may 
occur where there is a major disruption of available means of 
transportation to or from a work site, an essential Government service 
must be provided, and there is no other way to transport those 
employees.
    (j) Compelling operational considerations means those circumstances 
where the provision of home-to-work transportation to an employee is 
essential to the conduct of official business or would substantially 
increase a Federal agency's efficiency and economy. Home-to-work 
transportation may be justifiable if other available alternatives would 
involve substantial additional costs to the Government or expenditures 
of employee time. These circumstances need not be limited to emergency 
or life and death situations.


<R05>
Sec. 101-6.402  Policy.

    (a) Each Federal agency shall ensure that Government passenger 
carriers operated by its employees are used for official purposes only; 
i.e., to further the mission of the agency.
    (b) Each Federal agency shall limit the use of Government passenger 
carriers between an employee's residence and his/her place of employment 
to:
    (1) Those persons, including the President, the Vice-President, and 
other principal Federal officials and their designees, as provided in 31 
U.S.C. 1344 (b)(1) through (b)(7); or
    (2) Those persons engaged in field work as defined in Sec. 101-
6.401(g).
    (c) Other than those uses provided for in Sec. 101-6.402(b), a 
Federal agency shall only authorize the use of a Government passenger 
carrier for home-to-work transportation when there is:
    (1) A clear and present danger;
    (2) An emergency; or
    (3) A compelling operational consideration.
    (d) The comfort and convenience of an employee shall not be 
considered sufficient justification for an agency to authorize home-to-
work transportation under Sec. 101-6.402 (b) or (c).
    (e) Each Federal agency shall consider the location of the 
employee's residence prior to authorizing home-to-work transportation. 
Such transportation shall be authorized only within

[[Page 50]]

the usual commuting area for the locale of the employee's place of 
employment.
    (f) An employee authorized home-to-work transporation may elect to 
share space in a Government passenger carrier with other individuals on 
a space available basis, provided that the passenger carrier does not 
travel additional distances as a result, and provided such sharing is 
consistent with his/her agency's policy. When an agency establishes its 
space sharing policy, it should consider the effects of its potential 
liability for and to those individuals. If an employee is authorized 
transportation between his/her residence and an official duty site, this 
privilege does not extend to his/her spouse, other relatives, or friends 
unless--
    (1) It is consistent with the agency's policy,
    (2) They are with the employee when he/she is picked up, and
    (3) They are transported to the same place or event.
    (g) The head of each Federal agency shall authorize the use of home-
to-work transportation only to the extent that such transportation will 
substantially increase the efficiency and economy of the Government.


<R05>
Sec. 101-6.403  Agency responsibilities.

    (a) Each Federal agency shall maintain logs or other records 
necessary to establish that any home-to-work transportation was used for 
official purposes. The agency may determine the organizational level at 
which the logs should be maintained and kept. The logs or other records 
should be easily accessible for audit and should contain the following 
information:
    (1) Name and title of employee (or other identification, if 
confidential) using the passenger carrier;
    (2) Name and title of person authorizing use;
    (3) Passenger carrier identification;
    (4) Date;
    (5) Location;
    (6) Duration; and
    (7) Circumstances requiring home-to-work transportation.
    (b) The head of each Federal agency shall determine which employees 
are eligible to use home-to-work transportation in accordance with the 
definition of field work in Sec. 101-6.401(g) and the guidance contained 
in Sec. 101-6.405. Determinations must be in writing and must be 
accomplished as soon as practicable, but not later than 90 days from the 
effective date of the issuance of the regulations as a final rule. 
Determinations should be updated as necessary and must be recertified at 
least every 2 years thereafter. The authority to make determinations may 
not be delegated.
    (c) When circumstances described in Sec. 101-6.402(c) apply, the 
head of a Federal agency shall make a written determination, containing 
the following information: Name (or other identification, if 
confidential) and title of the employee; the reason for authorizing 
home-to-work transportation; and the anticipated duration of the 
authorization. The authority to make a determination may not be 
delegated. The determination should be completed before the employee is 
provided with home-to-work transportation. In some cases, an agency may 
wish to have certain employees ready to respond immediately when those 
circumstances arise without warning. To meet those events, the head of 
an agency may approve a contingency determination. Such a determination 
should include the names of authorized individuals or positions, the 
situation(s) upon which the provision of home-to-work transporation is 
contingent, and administrative controls. When it is used to provide an 
employee with home-to-work transportation, the contingency determination 
must be supplemented with the following information on the specific 
situation if it is not already part of the contingency determination: 
Name (or other identification, if confidential) and title of the 
employee; the reason that justified using the contingency determination; 
and the starting date and ending date (or anticipated ending date) of 
the authorization.
    (1) Each determination and contingency determination must be 
submitted to Congress in accordance with procedures set forth in 
Sec. 101-6.404. When a contingency determination is exercised, 
supplemental information on the specific situation, as outlined in 
paragraph (c) of this section, must also be

[[Page 51]]

provided to Congress. Such documentation must be easily available within 
the agency for audit. Additional guidance concerning determinations is 
contained in Sec. 101-6.405.
    (2) The initial duration of a determination shall not exceed 15 
calendar days. Should the circumstances justifying home-to-work 
transportation continue, the head of a Federal agency may approve a 
subsequent determination of not more than 90 additional calendar days. 
If at the end of the subsequent determination, the underlying 
circumstances continue to exist, the head of the Federal agency may 
authorize an additional extension of 90 calendar days. This process may 
continue as long as required by the circumstances.


<R05>
Sec. 101-6.404  Reports.

    Each initial determination and contingency determination, as well as 
supplemental information on each situation where a contingency 
determination is exercised, prepared under Sec. 101-6.403(c) shall be 
submitted to Congress promptly, but not later than 60 calendar days 
after approval. An agency may consolidate any subsequent determinations 
into a single report and submit them quarterly. Determinations and 
reports shall be sent to:

Chairman, Committee on Governmental Affairs, United States Senate, suite 
SD-340, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC 20510.
Chairman, Committee of Governmental Operations, United States House of 
Representatives, suite, 2157, Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, 
DC 20515.

Sec. 101-6.405  Additional guidance.

    (a) House of Representatives Report No. 99-451 99th Cong., 1st Sess. 
(1985) clearly indicates the intent of Congress to eliminate abuse of 
home-to-work transportation. The report notes, on p. 7, that:

    The provision for ``field work'' is meant to cover an employee of [a 
Federal] agency whose job requires the employee's presence at various 
locations that are at a distance from [the employee's] place of 
employment * * *. Examples of such employees include, but are not 
limited to, mine inspectors, meat inspectors, and certain other law 
enforcement officers, whose jobs require travel to several locations 
during the course of a workday. However, the field work exception may 
not be used (1) when the [employee's] workday begins at his or her 
official [G]overnment duty station, or (2) when the [employee] normally 
commutes to a fixed location, however far removed from his or her 
official duty station (for example, auditors or investigators assigned 
to a defense contractor plant). Although their daily work station is not 
located in a [G]overnment office, these [employees] are not performing 
``field work'' * * *. Like all [G]overnment employees, [employees] 
working in a ``field office'' are responsible for their own commuting 
costs.

    The report also states in the same section that the legislation is 
intended to allow home-to-work transportation for medical officers on 
outpatient service. The guidelines contained in the report, as well as 
the Congressional Record (daily ed. October 10, 1986, pp. S 15865-
15868), should provide an adequate basis for an agency to determine 
which of its employees may be authorized home-to-work transportation.
    (b) Additional examples of employees who may perform field work 
include, but are not limited to, quality assurance inspectors, 
construction inspectors, customs inspectors, dairy inspectors, revenue 
officers, compliance investigators, and personnel background 
investigators. The assignment of an employee to such a position does 
not, of itself, entitle an employee to receive daily home-to-work 
transportation. When authorized, such transportation should be provided 
only on days when the employee actually performs field work, and then 
only to the extent that such transportation will substantially increase 
the efficiency and economy of the Government.
    (c) Instances may occur when an employee, by the nature of his/her 
job, is designated as being authorized home-to-work transportation under 
the field work provision. However, circumstances may require that field 
work only be performed on an intermittent basis. In those instances, the 
agency shall establish procedures to ensure that a Government passenger 
carrier is used only when field work is actually being performed.
    (d) In making field work determinations under Sec. 101-6.403(b), an 
agency head may elect to designate positions

[[Page 52]]

rather than individual names, especially in positions where rapid 
turnover occurs. The determination should contain sufficient 
information, such as the job title, number, and operational level where 
the work is to be performed (i.e., five recruiter personnel or positions 
at the Detroit Army Recruiting Battalion) to satisfy an audit, if 
necessary.
    (e) Situations may arise where it is more cost-effective for the 
Government to provide an employee a vehicle for home-to-work 
transportation rather than have the employee travel a long distance to 
pick up a vehicle and then drive back toward or beyond his/her residence 
to perform his/her job. In those situations agencies should consider 
basing the vehicle at a Government facility located near the employee's 
job site. If such a solution is not feasible, an agency must then decide 
if the use of the vehicle should be approved under the compelling 
operational considerations definition. Home-to-work transportation in 
such cases may be approved only if other available alternatives would 
involve substantial cost to the Government or expenditure of substantial 
employee time.

section which are owned, leased, or otherwise provided to the Federal 
Government for the purpose of performing official business, at least one 
copy of the Code shall be conspicuously displayed within the space 
occupied by the Government. In all cases, additional copies of the Code 
may be displayed in other appropriate building locations, such as 
auditoriums, bulletin boards, cafeterias, locker rooms, reception areas, 
and other high-traffic areas.
    (d) Agencies of the Federal Government shall not pay any costs for 
the printing, framing, or other preparation of the Code. Agencies may 
properly pay incidental expenses, such as the cost of hardware, other 
materials, and labor incurred to display the Code. Display shall be 
consistent with the decor and architecture of the building space. 
Installation shall cause no permanent damage to stonework or other 
surfaces which are difficult to maintain or repair.
    (e) Agencies may obtain copies of the Code by submitting a 
requisition for National Stock Number (NSN) 7690-01-099-8167 in Fedstrip 
format to the GSA regional office responsible for providing support to 
the requisitioning agency. Agencies will be charged a nominal fee to 
cover shipping and handling.

        Subpart 101-6.6--Fire Protection (Firesafety) Engineering

    Source: 59 FR 54531, Nov. 1, 1994, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 101-6.600  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart provides the regulations of the General Services 
Administration (GSA) under Title I of the Fire Administration 
Authorization Act of 1992 concerning definition and determination of 
equivalent level of safety. The primary objective of this regulation is 
to provide a quantifiable means of determining compliance with the 
requirements of the Act. It is not a substitute for compliance with 
building and fire code

[[Page 53]]

requirements typically used in construction and occupancy of buildings.


<R05>
Sec. 101-6.601  Background.

    (a) The Fire Administration Authorization Act of 1992 (Pub. Law 102-
522) was signed into law by the President on October 26, 1992. Section 
106 Fire Safety Systems in Federally Assisted Buildings, of Title I--
United States Fire Administration, is commonly referred to as the 
Federal Fire Safety Act of 1992. This section amends the Fire Prevention 
and Control Act of 1974 (15 U.S.C. 2201 et seq.) to require sprinklers 
or an equivalent of safety, in certain types of Federal employee office 
buildings, Federal employee housing units, and federally assisted 
housing units.
    (b) The definition of an automatic sprinkler system is unique to the 
Act. In addition to describing the physical characteristics of an 
automatic sprinkler system, the definition sets a performance objective 
for the system. Automatic sprinkler systems installed in compliance with 
the Act must protect human lives. Sprinklers would provide the level of 
life safety prescribed in the Act by controlling the spread of fire and 
its effects beyond the room of origin. A functioning sprinkler system 
should activate prior to the onset of flashover.
    (c) This subpart establishes a general measure of building 
firesafety performance. To achieve the level of life safety specified in 
the Act, the structure under consideration must be designed, 
constructed, and maintained to minimize the impact of fire. As one 
option, building environmental conditions are specified in this subpart 
to ensure the life safety of building occupants outside the room of fire 
origin. They should be applicable independent of whether or not the 
evaluation is being conducted for the entire building or for just the 
hazardous areas. In the latter case, the room of origin would be the 
hazardous area while any room, space, or area could be a room of origin 
in the entire building scenarious.
    (d) The equivalent level of safety regulation in this subpart does 
not address property protection, business interruption potential, or 
firefighter safety during fire fighting operations. In situations where 
firefighters would be expected to rescue building occupants, the safety 
of both firefighters and occupants must be considered in the equivalent 
level of safety analysis. Thorough prefire planning will allow 
firefighters to choose whether or not to enter a burning building solely 
to fight a fire.


<R05>
Sec. 101-6.602  Application.

    The requirements of the Act and this subpart apply to all Federal 
agencies and all federallly owned and leased buildings in the United 
States, except those under the control of the Resolution Trust 
Corporation.


<R05>
Sec. 101-6.603  Definitions.

    (a) Qualified fire protection engineer is defined as an individual, 
with a thorough knowledge and understanding of the principles of physics 
and chemistry governing fire growth, spread, and suppression, meeting 
one of the following criteria:
    (1) An engineer having an undergraduate or graduate degree from a 
college or university offering a course of study in fire protection or 
firesafety engineering, plus a minimum of four (4) years work experience 
in fire protection engineering,
    (2) A professional engineer (P.E. or similar designation) registered 
in Fire Protection Engineering, or
    (3) A professional engineer (P.E. or similar designation) registered 
in a related engineering discipline and holding Member grade status in 
the International Society of Fire Protection Engineers.
    (b) Flashover means fire conditions in a confined area where the 
upper gas layer temperature reaches 600  deg.C (1100  deg.F) and the 
heat flux at floor level exceeds 20 kW/m\2\ (1.8 Btu/ft\2\/sec).
    (c) Reasonable worst case fire scenario means a combination of an 
ignition source, fuel items, and a building location likely to produce a 
fire which would have a significant adverse impact on the building and 
its occupants. The development of reasonable worst case scenarios must 
include consideration of types and forms of fuels present (e.g., 
furniture, trash, paper,

[[Page 54]]

chemicals), potential fire ignition locations (e.g., bedroom, office, 
closet, corridor), occupant capabilities (e.g., awake, intoxicated, 
mentally or physically impaired), numbers of occupants, detection and 
suppression system adequacy and reliability, and fire department 
capabilities. A quantitative analysis of the probability of occurrence 
of each scenario and combination of events will be necessary.
    (d) Room of origin means an area of a building where a fire can be 
expected to start. Typically, the size of the area will be determined by 
the walls, floor, and ceiling surrounding the space. However, this could 
lead to unacceptably large areas in the case of open plan office space 
or similar arrangements. Therefore, the maximum allowable fire area 
should be limited to 200 m\2\ (2000 ft\2\) including intervening spaces. 
In the case of residential units, an entire apartment occupied by one 
tenant could be considered as the room of origin to the extent it did 
not exceed the 200 m\2\ (2000 ft\2\) limitation.


<R05>
Sec. 101-6.604  Requirements.

    (a) The equivalent level of life safety evaluation is to be 
performed by a qualified fire protection engineer. The analysis should 
include a narrative discussion of the features of the building 
structure, function, operational support systems and occupant activities 
which impact fire protection and life safety. Each analysis should 
describe potential reasonable worst case fire scenarios and their impact 
on the building occupants and structure. Specific issues which must be 
addressed include rate of fire growth, type and location of fuel items, 
space layout, building construction, openings and ventilation, 
suppression capability, detection time, occupant notification, occupant 
reaction time, occupant mobility, and means of egress.
    (b) To be acceptable, the analysis must indicate that the existing 
and/or proposed safety systems in the building provide a period of time 
equal to or greater than the amount of time available for escape in a 
similar building complying with the Act. In conducting these analyses, 
the capability, adequacy, and reliability of all building systems 
impacting fire growth, occupant knowledge of the fire, and time required 
to reach a safety area will have to be examined. In particular, the 
impact of sprinklers on the development of hazardous conditions in the 
area of interest will have to be assessed. Three options are provided 
for establishing that an equivalent level of safety exists.
    (1) In the first option, the margin of safety provided by various 
alternatives is compared to that obtained for a code complying building 
with complete sprinkler protection. The margin of safety is the 
difference between the available safe egress time and the required safe 
egress time. Available safe egressd time is the time available for 
evacuation of occupants to an area of safety prior to the onset of 
untenable conditions in occupied areas or the egress pathways. The 
required safe egress time is the time required by occupants to move from 
their positions at the start of the fire to areas of safety. Available 
safe egress times would be developed based on analysis of a number of 
assumed reasonable worst case fire scenarios including assessment of a 
code complying fully sprinklered building. Additional analysis would be 
used to determine the expected required safe egress times for the 
various scenarios. If the margin of safety plus an appropriate safety 
factor is greater for an alternative than for the fully sprinklered 
building, then the alternative should provide an equivalent level of 
safety.
    (2) A second alternative is applicable for typical office and 
residential scenarios. In these situations, complete sprinkler 
protection can be expected to prevent flashover in the room of fire 
origin, limit fire size to no more than 1 megawatt (950 Btu/sec), and 
prevent flames from leaving the room of origin. The times required for 
each of these conditions to occur in the area of interest must be 
determined. The shortest of these three times would become the time 
available for escape. The difference between the minimum time available 
for escape and the time required for evacuation of building occupants 
would be the target margin of safety. Various alternative protection 
strategies would have to be evaluated to determine their impact on the 
times

[[Page 55]]

at which hazardous conditions developed in the spaces of interest and 
the times required for egress. If a combination of fire protection 
systems provides a margin of safety equal to or greater than the target 
margin of safety, then the combination could be judged to provide an 
equivalent level of safety.
    (3) As a third option, other technical analysis procedures, as 
approved by the responsible agency head, can be used to show 
equivalency.
    (c) Analytical and empirical tools, including fire models and 
grading schedules such as the Fire Safety Evaluation System (Alternative 
Approaches to Life Safety, NEPA 101M) should be used to support the life 
safety equivalency evaluation. If fire modeling is used as part of an 
analysis, an assessment of the predictive capabilities of the fire 
models must be included. This assessment should be conducted in 
accordance with the American Society for Testing and Materials Standard 
Guide for Evaluating the Predictive Capability of Fire Models (ASTM E 
1355).


<R05>
Sec. 101-6.605  Responsibility.

    The head of the agency responsible for physical improvements in the 
facility or providing Federal assistance or a designated representative 
will determine the acceptability of each equivalent level of safety 
analysis. The determination of acceptability must include a review of 
the fire protection engineer's qualifications, the appropriateness of 
the fire scenarios for the facility, and the reasonableness of the 
assumed maximum probable loss. Agencies should maintain a record of each 
accepted equivalent level of safety analysis and provide copies to fire 
departments or other local authorities for use in developing prefire 
plans.

<R05>
Sec. 101-6.1002  Policy.

    The policy to be followed by Federal departments, agencies, and 
commissions, consistent with the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as 
amended, is as follows:
    (a) An advisory committee shall be established only when it is 
essential to the conduct of agency business. Decision criteria include 
whether committee deliberations will result in the creation or 
elimination of, or change in regulations, guidelines, or rules affecting 
agency business; whether the information to be obtained is already 
available through another advisory committee or source within the 
Federal Government; whether the committee will make recommendations 
resulting in significant improvements in service or reductions in cost; 
or whether the committee's recommendations will provide an important 
additional perspective or viewpoint impacting agency operations;
    (b) An advisory committee shall be terminated whenever the stated 
objectives of the committee have been accomplished; the subject matter 
or work of the committee has become obsolete by the passing of time or 
the assumption of the committee's main functions by another entity 
within the Federal Government; or the agency determines that the cost of 
operation is excessive in relation to the benefits accruing to the 
Federal Government;
    (c) An advisory committee shall be fairly balanced in its membership 
in

[[Page 56]]

terms of the points of view represented and the functions to be 
performed; and
    (d) An advisory committee shall be open to the public in its 
meetings except in those circumstances where a closed meeting shall be 
determined proper and consistent with the provisions in the Government 
in the Sunshine Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(b).

Sec. 101-6.1005  Authorities for establishment of advisory committees.

    An advisory committee may be established in one of four ways:
    (a) By law where the Congress specifically directs the President or 
an agency to establish it;
    (b) By law where the Congress authorizes but does not direct the 
President or an agency to establish it. In this instance, the 
responsible agency head shall follow the procedures provided in 
Sec. 101-6.1007;
    (c) By the President by Executive Order; or
    (d) By an agency under general agency authority in title 5 of the 
United States Code or under other general agency-authorizing law. In 
this instance, an agency head shall follow the procedures provided in 
Sec. 101-6.1007.


<R05>
Sec. 101-6.1006  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 101-6.1007  Agency procedures for establishing advisory committees.

    (a) When an agency head decides that it is necessary to establish a 
committee, the agency must consider the functions of similar committees 
in the same agency before submitting a consultation to GSA to ensure 
that no duplication of effort will occur.
    (b) In establishing or utilizing an advisory committee, the head of 
an agency or designee shall comply with the Act and this subpart, and 
shall:
    (1) Prepare a proposed charter for the committee which includes the 
information listed in section 9(c) of the Act; and
    (2) Submit a letter and the proposed charter to the Secretariat 
proposing to establish or use, reestablish, or renew an advisory 
committee. The letter shall include the following information:
    (i) An explanation of why the committee is essential to the conduct 
of agency business and in the public interest;
    (ii) An explanation of why the committee's functions cannot be 
performed by the agency, another existing advisory committee of the 
agency, or other means such as a public hearing; and
    (iii) A description of the agency's plan to attain fairly balanced 
membership. The plan will ensure that, in the selection of members for 
the committee, the agency will consider a cross-section of those 
directly affected, interested, and qualified, as appropriate to the 
nature and functions of the committee. Committees requiring technical 
expertise should include persons

[[Page 58]]

with demonstrated professional or personal qualifications and experience 
relevant to the functions and tasks to be performed.
    (3) Subcommittees that do not function independently of the full or 
parent advisory committee need not follow the requirements of paragraphs 
(b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section. However, they are subject to all 
other requirements of the Act.
    (4) The requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section 
shall apply for any subcommittee of a chartered advisory committee, 
whether its members are drawn in whole or in part from the full or 
parent advisory committee, which functions independently of the parent 
advisory committee such as by making recommendations directly to the 
agency rather than for consideration by the chartered advisory 
committee.
    (c) The Secretariat will review the proposal and notify the agency 
of GSA's views within 15 calendar days of receipt, if possible. The 
agency head retains final authority for establishing a particular 
advisory committee.
    (d) The agency shall notify the Secretariat in writing that either:
    (1) The advisory committee is being established. The filing of the 
advisory committee charter as specified in Sec. 101-6.1013 shall be 
considered appropriate written notification in this instance. The date 
of filing constitutes the date of establishment or renewal. The agency 
head shall then comply with the provisions of Sec. 101-6.1009 for an 
established advisory committee; or
    (2) The advisory committee is not being established. In this 
instance, the agency shall also advise the Secretariat if the agency 
head intends to take any further action with respect to the proposed 
advisory committee.

Sec. 101-6.1008  The role of GSA.

    (a) The functions under section 7 of the Act will be performed for 
the Administrator by the Secretariat. The Secretariat assists the 
Administrator in prescribing administrative guidelines and management 
controls for advisory committees, and assists other agencies in 
implementing and interpreting these guidelines. In exercising internal 
controls over the management and supervision of the operations and 
procedures vested in each agency by section 8(b) of the Act and by 
Sec. 101-6.1009 and Sec. 101-6.1017 of this rule, agencies shall conform 
to the guidelines prescribed by GSA.
    (b) The Secretariat may request comments from agencies on management 
guidelines and policy issues of broad interagency interest or 
application to the Federal advisory committee program.
    (c) In advance of issuing informal guidelines, nonstatutory 
reporting requirements, and administrative procedures such as report 
formats or automation, the Secretariat shall request formal or informal 
comments from agency Committee Management Officers.
    (d) The Secretariat shall assure that follow-up reports required by 
section 6(b) of the Act are prepared and transmitted to the Congress as 
directed by the President; either by his delegate, by the agency 
responsible for providing support to a Presidential advisory committee, 
or by the responsible agency or organization designated pursuant to 
paragraph (c) of Sec. 101-6.1011. In performing this function, GSA may 
solicit the assistance of the Office of Management and Budget and other 
appropriate organizations, as deemed appropriate.

<R05>
Sec. 101-6.1030  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 101-6.1031  Amendments to advisory committee charters.

    (a) Committees specifically directed by law or authorized by law; or 
established by the President. The agency head shall be responsible for 
ensuring that any minor technical changes made to current charters are 
consistent with the relevant statute or Executive Order. When the 
Congress by law, or the President by Executive Order, changes the 
authorizing language which has been the basis for establishing an 
advisory committee, the agency head, or the chairperson of an 
independent Presidential advisory committee, shall:
    (1) Amend those sections of the current charter affected by the new 
law or Executive Order; and
    (2) File the amended charter as specified in Sec. 101-6.1013.
    (b) Committees established or used by an agency. The charter of an 
advisory committee established under general agency authority may be 
amended when an agency head determines that the existing charter no 
longer accurately reflects the objectives or functions of the committee. 
Changes may be minor, such as revising the name of the advisory 
committee, or modifying the estimated number or frequency of meetings. 
Changes may also be major such as those dealing with the objectives or 
composition of the committee. The agency head retains final authority 
for amending the charter of an advisory committee. Amending any existing 
advisory committee charter does not constitute renewal of the committee 
under Sec. 101-6.1029.
    (1) To make a minor amendment to a committee charter, an agency 
shall:
    (i) Amend the charter language as necessary, and
    (ii) File the amended charter as specified in Sec. 101-6.1013.
    (2) To make a major amendment to a committee charter, an agency 
shall:
    (i) Amend the charter language as necessary;
    (ii) Submit the proposed amended charter with a letter to the 
Secretariat requesting GSA's views on the amended language, along with 
an explanation of the purpose of the changes and why they are necessary. 
The Secretariat will review the proposed changes and notify the agency 
of GSA's views within 15 calendar days of the request, if possible; and
    (iii) File the amended charter as specified in Sec. 101-6.1013.


<R05>
Sec. 101-6.1032  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 101-6.1033  Compensation and expense reimbursement of advisory committee members, staffs and consultants.

    (a) Uniform pay guidelines for members of an advisory committee. 
Nothing in this subpart shall require an agency head to provide 
compensation, unless

[[Page 63]]

otherwise provided by law, to a member of an advisory committee. 
However, when compensation is deemed appropriate by an agency, it shall 
fix the pay of the members of an advisory committee to the daily 
equivalent of a rate of the General Schedule in 5 U.S.C. 5332 unless the 
members are appointed as consultants and compensated under 5 U.S.C. 
3109. In determining an appropriate rate of pay for the members, an 
agency shall give consideration to the significance, scope, and 
technical complexity of the matters with which the advisory committee is 
concerned and the qualifications required of the members of the advisory 
committee. An agency may not fix the pay of the members of an advisory 
committee at a rate higher than the daily equivalent of the maximum rate 
for a GS-15 under the General Schedule, unless a higher rate is mandated 
by statute, or the head of the agency has personally determined that a 
higher rate of pay under the General Schedule is justified and 
necessary. Such a determination must be reviewed by the head of the 
agency annually. Under this subpart, an agency may not fix the pay of 
the members of an advisory committee at a rate of pay higher than the 
daily equivalent of a rate for a GS-18, as provided in 5 U.S.C. 5332.
    (b) Pay for staff members of an advisory committee. An agency may 
fix the pay of each advisory committee staff member at a rate of the 
General Schedule in which the Staff member's position would 
appropriately be placed (5 U.S.C. chapter 51). An agency may not fix the 
pay of a staff member at a rate higher than the daily equivalent of the 
maximum rate for GS-15, unless the agency head has determined that under 
the General Schedule the staff member's position would appropriately be 
placed at a grade higher than GS-15. This determination must be reviewed 
annually by the agency head.
    (1) In establishing rates of compensation, the agency head shall 
comply with any applicable statutes, regulations, Executive Orders, and 
administrative guidelines.
    (2) A staff member who is a Federal employee shall serve with the 
knowledge of the Designated Federal Officer and the approval of the 
employee's direct supervisor. If a non-Federal employee, the staff 
member shall be appointed in accordance with applicable agency 
procedures, following consultation with the advisory committee.
    (c) Pay for consultants to an advisory committee. An agency shall 
fix the pay of a consultant to an advisory committee after giving 
consideration to the qualifications required of the consultant and the 
significance, scope, and technical complexity of the work. The 
compensation may not exceed the maximum rate of pay authorized by 5 
U.S.C. 3109, and shall be in accordance with any applicable statutes, 
regulations, Executive Orders and administrative guidelines.
    (d) Gratuitous services. In the absence of any special limitations 
applicable to a specific agency, nothing in this subpart shall prevent 
an agency from accepting the gratuitous services of an advisory 
committee member, staff member, or consultant who agrees in advance to 
serve without compensation.
    (e) Travel expenses. Advisory committee members and staff members, 
while engaged in the performance of their duties away from their homes 
or regular places of business, may be allowed travel expenses, including 
per diem in lieu of subsistence, as authorized by section 5703 of title 
5, United States Code, for persons employed intermittently in the 
Government service.
    (f) Services for handicapped members. While performing advisory 
committee duties, an advisory committee member who is blind or deaf or 
who qualifies as a handicapped individual may be provided services by a 
personal assistant for handicapped employees if the member:
    (1) Qualifies as a handicapped individual as defined by section 501 
of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794); and
    (2) Does not otherwise qualify for assistance under 5 U.S.C. 3102 by 
reason of being an employee of an agency.
    (g) Exclusions. (1) Nothing in this section shall prevent any person 
who (without regard to his or her service with an advisory committee) is 
a full-time Federal employee from receiving compensation at a rate which 
he or she

[[Page 64]]

otherwise would be compensated as a full-time Federal employee.
    (2) Nothing in this section shall prevent any person who immediately 
before his or her service with an advisory committee was a full-time 
Federal employee from receiving compensation at the rate at which he or 
she was compensated as a full-time Federal employee.
    (3) Nothing in this section shall affect a rate of pay or a 
limitation on a rate of pay that is specifically established by law or a 
rate of pay established under the General Schedule classification and 
pay system in chapter 51 and chapter 53 of title 5, United States Code.


<R05>

    (b) The President's annual report to the Congress shall be prepared 
by GSA based on reports filed on a fiscal year basis by each agency 
consistent with the information specified in section 6(c) of the Act. 
Reports from agencies shall be consistent with instructions provided 
annually by the Secretariat. Agency reports shall also include 
information requested to enable the Secretariat to carry out the annual 
comprehensive review of each advisory committee as required by section 
7(b) of the Act. These reports have been cleared in accordance with 
FIRMR subpart 201-45.6 in 41 CFR chapter 201 and assigned interagency 
report control number 0304-GSA-XX.
    (c) In accordance with section 10(d) of the Act, advisory committees 
holding closed meetings shall issue reports at least annually, setting 
forth a summary of activities consistent with the policy of section 
552(b) of title 5, United States Code.
    (d) Subject to section 552 of title 5, United States Code, eight 
copies of each report made by an advisory committee, including any 
report on closed meetings as specified in paragraph (c) of this section, 
and, where appropriate, background papers prepared by consultants, shall 
be filed with the Library of Congress as required by section 13 of the 
Act, for public inspection and use at the location specified in

    (2) 60 days from the date established by the Administrator to

point of contact, all comments from State, areawide, regional, and local 
officials and entities that differ from it must also be transmitted.
    (c) If a State has not established a process, or is unable to submit 
a State process recommendation, State, areawide, regional and local 
officials and entities may submit comments to GSA.
    (d) If a program or activity is not selected for a State process, 
State, areawide, regional and local officials and entities may submit

point of contact, the Administrator follows the procedures of Sec. 101-
6.2110 of this part.
    (e) The Administrator considers comments which do not constitute a 
State process recommendation submitted under these regulations, and for 
which the Administrator is not required to apply the procedures of

single point of contact, or directly to GSA by a commenting party.


<R05>
Sec. 101-6.2110  How does the Administrator make efforts to accommodate intergovernmental concerns?

    (1) Accepts the recommendation;
    (2) Reaches a mutually agreeable solution with the State process; or
    (3) Provides the single point of contact with such written 
explanation of its decision, as the Administrator in his or her 
discretion deems appropriate. The Administrator may also supplement the 
written explanation by providing the explanation to the single point of 
contact by telephone, other telecommunication, or other means.
    (b) In any explanation under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the 
Administrator informs the single point of contact that:
    (1) GSA will not implement its decision for at least ten days after 
the single point of contact receives the explanation; or
    (2) The Administrator has reviewed the decision and determined that, 
because of unusual circumstances, the waiting period of at least ten 
days is not feasible.
    (c) For purposes of computing the waiting period under paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section, a single point of contact is presumed to have

that have not adopted a process under the Order or have not selected a 
GSA program or activity; and
    (4) Responding pursuant to Sec. 101-6.2110 of this part if the 
Administrator receives a recommendation from a designated areawide 
agency transmitted by a single point of contact, in cases in which the 
review, coordination, and communication with GSA have been delegated.
    (b) The Administrator uses the procedures in Sec. 101-6.2110 if a 
State process provides a State process recommendation to GSA through a 
single point of contact.


<R05>
Sec. 101-6.2112  How may a State simplify, consolidate, or substitute federally required State plans?

its own submission date, and select the planning period for a State 
plan.
    (2) Consolidate means that a State may meet statutory and regulatory 
requirements by combining two or more plans into one document and that 
the State can select the format, submission date, and planning period 
for the consolidated plan.
    (3) Substitute means that a State may use a plan or other document 
that it has developed for its own purposes to meet Federal requirements.
    (b) If not inconsistent with law, a State may decide to try to

<R05>
Sec. 101-8.302  General prohibitions.

    No qualified handicapped persons shall, on the basis of handicap, be 
excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or otherwise 
be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity that 
receives or benefits from Federal assistance from GSA.


<R05>
Sec. 101-8.303  Specific prohibitions.

    (a) A recipient, in providing any aid, benefit, or service, may not 
directly or through contractual, licensing, or other arrangements, on 
the basis of handicap:

[[Page 70]]

    (1) Deny a qualified person the opportunity to participate in or 
benefit from the aid, benefit, or service;
    (2) Afford a qualified handicapped person an opportunity to 
participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service that is not 
equal to that afforded others;
    (3) Provide a qualified handicapped person with an aid, benefit, or 
service that is not as effective in affording equal opportunity to 
obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same 
level of achievement as that provided others;
    (4) Provide different or separate aid, benefits, or services to 
handicapped persons or to any class of handicapped persons than is 
provided to others unless the action is necessary to provide qualified 
handicapped persons with aid, benefits, or services that are as 
effective as those provided to others;
    (5) Aid or perpetuate discrimination against a qualified handicapped 
person by providing significant assistance to an agency, organization, 
or person that discriminates on the basis of handicap in providing any 
aid, benefit, or services to beneficiaries of the recipient's program;
    (6) Deny a qualified handicapped person the opportunity to 
participate as a member of planning committees, advisory boards, or 
other groups; or
    (7) Otherwise limit a qualified handicapped person in the enjoyment 
of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity enjoyed by others 
receiving the aid, benefit, or service.
    (b) For purposes of this subpart, aids, benefits, and services, to 
be equally effective, are not required to produce the identical result 
or level of achievement for handicapped and nonhandicapped persons, but 
must afford handicapped persons equal opportunity to obtain the same 
result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of 
achievement in the most integrated setting appropriate to the person's 
needs.
    (c) Despite the existence of permissible separate or different 
programs or activities, a recipient may not deny a qualified handicapped 
person the opportunity to participate in programs or activities that are 
not separate or different.
    (d) A recipient may not, directly or through contractual or other 
arrangements, use criteria or methods of administration that:
    (1) Have the effect of subjecting qualified handicapped persons to 
discrimination on the basis of handicap;
    (2) Have the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially 
impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the recipient's program 
with respect to handicapped persons; or
    (3) Perpetuate the discrimination of another recipient if both 
recipients are subject to common administrative control or are agencies 
of the same State.
    (e) In determining the site of a facility, an applicant for 
assistance or a recipient may not make selections that:
    (1) Have the effect of excluding handicapped persons from, denying 
them the benefits of, or otherwise subjecting them to discrimination 
under any program or activity that receives Federal assistance from GSA; 
or
    (2) Have the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially 
impairing the accomplishment of the objectives of the program or 
activity with respect to handicapped persons.
    (f) As used in this section, the aid, benefit, or service provided 
under a program or activity receiving or benefitting from Federal 
assistance includes any aid, benefit, or service provided in or through 
a facility that has been constructed, expanded, altered, leased, or 
rented, or otherwise acquired, in whole or in part, with Federal 
assistance.
    (g) The exclusion of nonhandicapped persons from the benefits of a 
program limited by Federal statute or Executive order to handicapped 
persons or the exclusion of a specific class of handicapped persons from 
a program limited by Federal statute or Executive order to a different 
class of handicapped persons is not prohibited by this subpart.
    (h) Recipients shall take appropriate steps to ensure that 
communications with the donees, applicants, employees, and handicapped 
persons participating in federally assisted programs and activities or 
receiving aid, benefits, or services are available to persons with 
impaired vision and hearing. Examples of communications methods include:

[[Page 71]]

Telecommunication devices for the deaf (TDD's), other telephonic 
devices, provision of braille materials, readers, and qualified sign 
language interpreters.
    (i) The enumeration of specific forms of prohibited discrimination 
in this section does not limit the generality of the prohibition in 
Sec. 101-8.302 of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 101-8.304  Effect of State or local law or other requirements and effect of employment opportunities.

    (a) The obligation to comply with this subpart is not obviated or 
alleviated by the existence of any State or local law or other 
requirement that, on the basis of handicap, imposes prohibitions or 
limits upon the eligibility of qualified handicapped persons to receive 
services or to practice any occupation or profession.
    (b) The obligation to comply with this subpart is not obviated or 
alleviated because employment opportunities in any occupation or 
profession are or may be more limited for handicapped persons than for 
nonhandicapped persons.


<R05>
Sec. 101-8.305  Employment practices prohibited.

    (a) No qualified handicapped person shall, on the basis of handicap, 
be subjected to employment discrimination under any program or activity 
to which this subpart applies.
    (b) A recipient shall make all decisions concerning employment under 
any program or activity to which this subpart applies in a manner which 
ensures that discrimination on the basis of handicap does not occur and 
may not limit, segregate, or classify applicants or employees in any way 
that adversely affects their opportunities or status because of 
handicap.
    (c) A recipient may not participate in a contractual or other 
relationship that has the effect of subjecting qualified handicapped 
applicants or employees to discrimination prohibited by this subpart. 
The relationships referred to in this paragraph include relationships 
with employment and referral agencies, labor unions, organizations 
providing or administering fringe benefits to employees of the 
recipient, and organizations providing training and apprenticeship 
programs.
    (d) The provisions of this subpart apply to:
    (1) Recruitment, advertising, and processing of applications for 
employment;
    (2) Hiring, upgrading, promotion, award of tenure, demotion,

    (6) Fringe benefits available by virture of employment, whether

related activities, and selection for leaves of absence to pursue 
training;
    (8) Employer-sponsored activities, including social or recreational 
programs; and
    (9) Any other term, condition, or privilege of employment.
    (e) A recipient's obligation to comply with this subpart is not 
affected by any inconsistent term of any collective bargaining agreement 
to which it is a party.


<R05>
Sec. 101-8.306  Reasonable accommodation.

    (a) A recipient shall make reasonable accommodation to the known 
physical or metal limitations of an otherwise qualified handicapped 
applicant or employee unless the recipient can demonstrate that the 
accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of its 
program.
    (b) Reasonable accommodation may include:
    (1) Making facilities used by employees readily accessible to and 
usable by handicapped persons; and
    (2) Job restructing; part-time or modified work schedules; 
acquisition

[[Page 72]]

or modification of equipment or devices, such as telecommunications 
devices or other telephonic devices for hearing impaired persons; 
provision of reader or qualified sign language interpreters; and other 
similar actions. These actions are to be taken either upon request of 
the handicapped employee or, if not so requested, upon the recipient's 
own initiative, after consultation with and approval by the handicapped 
person.
    (c) In determining, under paragraph (a) of this section, whether an 
accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of a 
recipient's program, factors to be considered include:
    (1) The overall size of the recipient's program with respect to 
number of employees, number and type of facilities, and size of budget;
    (2) The type of the recipient's operation, including the composition 
and structure of the recipient's work force; and
    (3) The nature and cost of the accommodation needed.
    (d) A recipient may not deny an employment opportunity to a 
qualified handicapped employee or applicant if the basis for the denial 
is the need to make reasonable accommodation to the physical or mental 
limitations of the employee or applicant.


<R05>
Sec. 101-8.307  Employment criteria.

    (a) A recipient may not use an employment test or other selection 
criterion that screens out or tends to screen out handicapped persons 
unless the test score or other selection criterion, as used by the 
recipient, is shown to be job-related for the position in question.
    (b) A recipient shall ensure that employment tests are adapted for 
use by persons who have handicaps that impair sensory, manual, or 
speaking skills except where those skills are the factors that the test 
purports to measure.


<R05>
Sec. 101-8.308  Preemployment inquiries.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, a 
recipient may not conduct a preemployment medical examination or may not 
make preemployment inquiries of an applicant as to whether the applicant 
is a handicapped person or as to the nature or severity of a handicap. A 
recipient may, however, make preemployment inquiries into an applicant's 
ability to perform job-related functions.
    (b) When a recipient is taking remedial action to correct the 
effects of past discrimination, or is taking voluntary action to 
overcome the effects of conditions that resulted in limited 
participation in its federally assisted program or activity, or when a 
recipient is taking affirmative action under section 503 of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, the recipient may invite 
applicants for employment to indicate whether, and to what extent, they 
are handicapped provided that:
    (1) The recipient states clearly on any written questionnaire used 
for this purpose or makes clear orally, if no written questionnaire is 
used, that the information requested is intended for use solely in 
connection with its remedial action obligations or its voluntary or 
affirmative action efforts; and
    (2) The recipient states clearly that the information is requested 
on a voluntary basis, that it will be kept confidential as provided in 
paragraph (d) of this section, that refusal to provide it will not 
subject the applicant or employee to any adverse treatment, and that it 
will be used only in accordance with this subpart.
    (c) This section does not prohibit a recipient from conditioning an 
offer of employment on the results of a medical examination conducted 
prior to the employee's entrance on duty provided that all entering 
employees are subjected to the examination regardless of handicap or 
absence of handicap and results of the examination are used only in 
accordance with the requirements of this subpart.
    (d) Information obtained in accordance with this section concerning 
the medical condition or history of the applicant shall be collected and 
maintained on separate forms that are to be accorded confidentiality as 
medical records, except that:
    (1) Supervisors and managers may be informed of restrictions on the 
work or duties of handicapped persons and of necessary accommodations;

[[Page 73]]

    (2) First aid and safety personnel may be informed, where 
appropriate, if the condition might require emergency treatment; and
    (3) Government officials investigating compliance with section 504 
of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, shall be provided 
relevant information upon request.


<R05>
Sec. 101-8.309  Program accessibility.

    (a) General. No handicapped person shall, because a recipient's 
facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons, be 
denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or be 
subjected to discrimination under any program or activity that receives 
or benefits from Federal assistance from GSA.
    (b) Program accessibility. A recipient shall operate any program or 
activity to which this subpart applies so that the program or activity, 
when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by 
handicapped persons. This paragraph does not require a recipient to make 
each of its existing facilities or every part of a facility accessible 
to and usable by handicapped persons.
    (c) Methods. A recipient may comply with the requirement of 
paragraph (a) of this section through such means as acquisition or 
redesign of equipment, such as telecommunications devices or other 
telephonic devices for the hearing impaired; reassignment of classes or 
other services to alternate sites which have accessible buildings; 
assignment of aides to beneficiaries, such as readers for the blind or 
qualified sign language interpreters for the hearing impaired when 
appropriate; home visits; delivery of health, welfare, or other social 
services at alternate accessible sites; alterations of existing 
facilities and construction of new facilities in conformance with the 
requirements of Sec. 101-8.310; or any other methods that result in 
making its program or activity accessible to handicapped persons. A 
recipient is not required to make structural changes in existing 
facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance 
with paragraph (a) of this section. In choosing among available methods 
for meeting the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, a 
recipient shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and 
activities to handicapped persons in the most integrated setting 
appropriate.
    (d) Small service providers. If a recipient with fewer than 15 
employees finds, after consultation with a handicapped person seeking 
its services, that there is no available method of complying with 
paragraph (a) of this section other than making a significant alteration 
in its existing facilities, the recipient may, as an alternative, refer 
the handicapped person to other providers of those services that are 
accessible at no additional cost to the handicapped person.
    (e) Time period. A recipient shall comply with the requirement of 
paragraph (a) of this section within 60 days of the effective date of 
this subpart, except that where structural changes in facilities are 
necessary, the changes are to be made as expeditiously as possible, but 
in no event later than 3 years after the effective date of this subpart.
    (f) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to 
facilities are necessary to meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of 
this section, a recipient shall develop, within 6 months of the 
effective date of this subpart, a transition plan setting forth the 
steps necessary to complete the changes. The plan shall be developed 
with the assistance of interested persons, including handicapped persons 
or organizations representing handicapped persons, and the plan must 
meet with the approval of the Director of Civil Rights, GSA. A copy of 
the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. At a 
minimum, the plan shall:
    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the recipient's facilities that 
limit the accessibility to and usability by handicapped persons of its 
program or activity;
    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;
    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
full program accessibility and, if the time period or the transition 
plan is longer than 1 year, identify steps that will be taken during 
each year of the transition period; and

[[Page 74]]

    (4) Indicate the person responsible for implementation of the plan.
    (g) Notice. The recipient shall adopt and implement procedures to 
ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision 
or hearing, can obtain information concerning the existence and location 
of services, activities, and facilities that are accessible to, and 
usable by, handicapped persons.


<R05>
Sec. 101-8.310  New construction.

    (a) Design and construction. Each facility or part of a facility 
constructed by, on behalf of, or for the use of a recipient shall be 
designed and constructed in a manner that the facility or part of the 
facility is readily accessible to, and usable by, handicapped persons, 
if the construction began after the effective date of this subpart.
    (b) Alteration. Each facility or part of a facility which is altered 
by, on behalf of, or for the use of a recipient after the effective date 
of this subpart in a manner that affects or could affect the usability 
of the facility or part of the facility shall, to the maximum extent 
feasible, be altered in a manner that the altered portion of the 
facility is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons.
    (c) GSA Accessibility Standard. Design, construction, or alteration 
of facilities shall be in conformance with the ``GSA Accessibility 
Standard,'' PBS (PCD): DG6, October 14, 1980. A copy of the standard can 
be obtained through the Business Service Centers, General Services 
Administration, National Capital Region, 7th and D Streets, SW., 
Washington, DC 20407 or Regional Business Service Centers, Region 1, 
John W. McCormack, Post Office and Courthouse, Boston, Massachusetts 
02109; Region 2, 26 Federal Plaza, New York, New York 10007; Region 3, 
Ninth and Market Streets, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107; Region 4, 75 
Spring Street, SW., Atlanta, Georgia 30303; Region 5, 230 South 
Dearborn, Chicago, Illinois 60604; Region 6, 1500 East Bannister Road, 
Kansas City, Missouri 64131; Region 7, 819 Taylor Street, Fort Worth, 
Texas 76102; Region 8, Building 41, Denver Federal Center, Denver, 
Colorado 80225; Region 9, 525 Market Street, San Francisco, California 
94105; Region 10, GSA Center, Auburn, Washington 98002.

In cases of practical difficulty, unnecessary hardship, or extreme 
differences, exceptions may be granted from the literal requirements of 
the above-mentioned standard, as defined in Secs. 101-19.604 and 101-
19.605 (``Exceptions'' and ``Waiver or modification of standards''), but 
only when it is clearly evident that equal facilitation and protection 
are thereby secured.


<R05>
Sec. 101-8.311  Historic preservation programs.

    (a) Definitions. For purposes of this section, the term:
    (1) Historic preservation programs means programs receiving Federal 
financial assistance that has preservation of historic properties as a 
primary purpose.
    (2) Historic properties means those properties that are listed or 
eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.
    (3) Substantial impairment means a permanent alteration that results 
in a significant loss of the integrity of finished materials, design 
quality or special character.
    (b) Obligation--(1) Program accessibility. In the case of historic 
preservation programs, program accessibility means that, when viewed in 
its entirety, a program is readily accessible to and usable by 
handicapped persons.

This paragraph does not necessarily require a recipient to make each of 
its existing historic properties or every part of an historic property 
accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. Methods of achieving 
program accessibility include:
    (i) Making physical alterations which enable handicapped persons to 
have access to otherwise inaccessible areas or features of historic 
properties;
    (ii) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict otherwise 
inaccessible areas or features of historic properties;
    (iii) Assigning persons to guide handicapped persons into or through 
otherwise inaccessible portions of historic properties;
    (iv) Adopting other innovative methods to achieve program 
accessibility.

[[Page 75]]


Because the primary benefit of an historic preservation program is the 
experience of the historic property itself, in taking steps to achieve 
program accessibility, recipients shall give priority to those means 
which make the historic property, or portions thereof, physically 
accessible to handicapped individuals.
    (2) Waiver of accessibility standards. Where program accessibility 
cannot be achieved without causing a substantial impairment of 
significant historic features, the Administrator may grant a waiver of 
the program accessibility requirement. In determining whether program 
accessibility can be achieved without causing a substantial impairment, 
the Administrator shall consider the following factors:
    (i) Scale of property, reflecting its ability to absorb alterations;
    (ii) Use of the property, whether primarily for public or private 
purpose;
    (iii) Importance of the historic features of the property to the 
conduct of the program; and
    (iv) Cost of alterations in comparison to the increase in 
accessibility.

The Administrator shall periodically review any waiver granted under 
this section and may withdraw it if technological advances or other 
changes so warrant.
    (c) Advisory Council comments. Where the property is federally owned 
or where Federal funds may be used for alterations, the comments of the 
Advisory Council on Historic Preservation shall be obtained when 
required by section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 
1966, as amended (16 U.S.C. 470), and 36 CFR part 800, prior to 
effectuation of structural alterations.

Sec. 101-8.312  Procedures.

    The procedural provisions of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 
1964 are adopted and stated in Secs. 101-6.205-101-6.215 and apply to 
this subpart. (Sec. 205(c), 63 Stat. 390; 40 U.S.C. 486(c).)


<R05>
Sec. 101-8.313  Self-evaluation.

    (a) Procedures. Each recipient shall, within one year of the 
effective date of this part:
    (1) Whenever possible, evaluate, with the assistance of interested 
persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing 
handicapped persons, its current policies and practices and the effects 
thereof that do not or may not meet the requirements of this part;
    (2) Modify any policies and practices which do not or may not meet 
the requirements of this part; and
    (3) Take appropriate remedial steps to eliminate the effects of 
discrimination which resulted or may have resulted from adherence to 
these questionable policies and practices.
    (b) Availability of self-evaluation and related materials. 
Recipients shall maintain on file, for at least three years following 
its completion, the evaluation required under paragraph (a) of this 
section, and shall provide to the Director, upon request, a description 
of any modifications made under paragraph (a)(2) of this section and of 
any remedial steps taken under paragraph (a)(3) of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 101-8.704  Rules against age discrimination.

    The rules stated in this section are limited by the exceptions 
contained in Sec. 101-8.706 of this regulation
    (a) General rule. No person in the United States may on the basis of 
age, be excluded from participation, be denied the benefits of, or be 
subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving 
Federal financial assistance from GSA.
    (b) Specific rules. A recipient may not, in any program or activity 
receiving Federal financial assistance, directly or through contractual 
licensing, or other arrangement, use age distinctions or take any other 
actions that have the effect on the basis of age, of:

[[Page 77]]

    (1) Excluding individuals from participating in, denying them the 
benefits of, or subjecting them to discrimination under a program or 
activity receiving Federal financial assistance; or
    (2) Denying or limiting individual opportunity to participate in any 
program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.
    (c) The forms of age discrimination listed in paragraph (b) of this 
section are not necessarily a complete list.


<R05>
Sec. 101-8.705  Definition of normal operation and statutory objective.

    The terms normal operation and statutory objective are defined as 
follows:
    (a) Normal operation means the operation of a program or activity 
without significant changes that would inhibit meeting objectives.
    (b) Statutory objective means any purpose of a program or activity 
expressly stated in any Federal, State, or local statute or ordinance 
adopted by an elected, general purpose legislative body.


<R05>
Sec. 101-8.706  Exceptions to the rules against age discrimination.


<R05>
Sec. 101-8.706-1  Normal operation or statutory objective of any program or activity.

    A recipient is permitted to take an action, otherwise prohibited, if 
the action reasonably takes into account age as a factor necessary to 
the normal operation or achievement of any statutory objective of a 
program or activity. An action reasonably takes into account age as a 
factor if:
    (a) Age is used as a measure or approximation of one or more other 
characteristics; and
    (b) The other characteristic must be measured or approximated for 
the normal operation of the program or activity to continue, or to 
achieve any statutory objective of the program or activity; and
    (c) The other characteristic can be reasonably measured or 
approximated by the use of age; and
    (d) The other characteristic is impractical to measure directly on 
an individual basis.


<R05>
Sec. 101-8.706-2  Reasonable factors other than age.

    (a) A recipient is permitted to take an action, otherwise prohibited 
by Sec. 101-8.706-1, which is based on something other than age, even 
though the action may have a disproportionate effect on persons of 
different ages.
    (b) An action may be based on a factor other than age only if the 
factor bears a direct and substantial correlation to the normal 
operation of the program or activity or to the achievement of a 
statutory objective.


<R05>
Sec. 101-8.707  Burden of proof.

    The burden of proving that an age distinction or other action falls 
within the exceptions outlined in Sec. 101-8.706 is the recipient's.


<R05>
Sec. 101-8.708  Affirmative action by recipient.

    Even in the absence of a finding of age discrimination, a recipient 
may take affirmative action to overcome the effects resulting in limited 
participation in the recipient's program or activity.


<R05>
Sec. 101-8.709  Special benefits for children and the elderly.

    If a recipient's program provides special benefits to the elderly or 
to children, such use of age distinctions is presumed to be necessary to 
the normal operation of the program, notwithstanding the provisions of 
Sec. 101-8.705.


<R05>
Sec. 101-8.710  Age distinctions contained in General Services Administration regulation.

    Any age distinctions contained in a rule or regulation issued by GSA 
are presumed to be necessary to the achievement of a statutory objective 
of the program to which the rule or regulation applies. The GSA 
regulation 41 CFR 101-44.207(a) (3) through (27), describes specific 
Federal financial assistance programs which provide assistance to all 
age groups. However, the ``Child Care Center'' program servicing 
children through age 14, and ``Programs for Older Individuals'', are the 
only two programs where age distinctions are provided.

[[Page 78]]


<R05>
Sec. 101-8.711  General responsibilities.

    Each recipient of Federal financial assistance from GSA is 
responsible for ensuring that its programs and activities comply with 
the Act and this regulation and must take steps to eliminate violations 
of the Act. A recipient is also responsible for maintaining records, 
providing information, and affording GSA access to its records to the 
extent GSA finds necessary to determine whether the recipient is 
complying with the Act and this regulation.


<R05>
Sec. 101-8.712  Notice to subrecipients and beneficiaries.

    (a) If a primary recipient passes on Federal financial assistance 
from GSA to subrecipients, the primary recipient provides to 
subrecipients, written notice of their obligations under the Act and 
this regulation.
    (b) Each recipient makes necessary information about the Act and 
this regulation available to its program beneficiaries to inform them 
about the protections against discrimination provided by the Act and 
this regulation.


<R05>
Sec. 101-8.713  Assurance of compliance and recipient assessment of age distinctions.

    (a) Each recipient of Federal financial assistance from GSA signs a 
written assurance as specified by GSA that it intends to comply with the 
Act and this regulation.
    (b) Recipient assessment of age distinctions.
    (1) As part of a compliance review under Sec. 101-8.715 or complaint 
investigation under Sec. 101.8.718, GSA may require a recipient 
employing the equivalent of 15 or more employees to complete a written 
self-evaluation of any age distinction imposed in its program or 
activity receiving Federal financial assistance from GSA to assess the 
recipient's compliance with the Act.
    (2) If an assessment indicates a violation of the Act and the GSA 
regulation, the recipient takes corrective action.


<R05>
Sec. 101-8.714  Information requirements.

    Each recipient must:
    (a) Keep records in a form and containing information that GSA 
determines necessary to ensure that the recipient is complying with the 
Act and this regulation.
    (b) Provide to GSA upon request, information and reports that GSA 
determines necessary to find out whether the recipient is complying with 
the Act and this regulation.
    (c) Permit reasonable access by GSA to books, records, accounts, 
facilities, and other sources of information to the extent GSA finds it 
necessary to find out whether the recipient is complying with the Act 
and this regulation. GSA adopts HHS policy regarding the kinds of data 
and information recipients are expected to keep (45 CFR 90.34). This 
policy is parallel to compliance information sections in the title VI, 
title IX, and section 504 implementation regulations. While recognizing 
the need for enough data to assess recipient compliance, GSA is 
committed to lessening the data gathering burden on recipients. GSA 
further recognizes that there is no established body of knowledge or 
experience to guide the assessment of age discrimination. This 
regulation, therefore, does not impose specific data requirements upon 
recipients, rather, it allows GSA to be flexible in deciding what kinds 
of data should be kept by recipients, based on what kinds of data prove 
useful as GSA gains experience with the Age Discrimination Act, and age 
discrimination issues become clearer.
    (d) In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 
59-511), the reporting and record keeping provisions included in this 
regulation will be submitted, for approval, to the Office of Management 
and Budget (OMB). No data collection or record keeping requirement will 
be imposed on recipients or donees without the required OMB approval 
number.


<R05>
Sec. 101-8.715  Compliance reviews.

    (a) GSA may conduct compliance reviews and use similar procedures to 
investigate and correct violations of the Act and this regulation. GSA 
may conduct the reviews even in the absence of a complaint against a 
recipient. The reviews may be as comprehensive as necessary to determine 
whether a violation of the Act and this regulation has occurred.

[[Page 79]]

    (b) If a compliance review indicates a violation of the Act or this 
regulation, GSA attempts to achieve voluntary compliance with the Act. 
If compliance cannot be achieved, GSA arranges for enforcement as 
described in Sec. 101-8.720.


<R05>
Sec. 101-8.716  Complaints.

    (a) Any person, individually or as a member of a class (defined at 
Sec. 101-8.703(e)) or on behalf of others, may file a complaint with GSA 
alleging discrimination prohibited by the Act or this regulation based 
on an action occurring after July 1, 1979. A complainant must file a 
complaint within 80 days from the date the complainant first has 
knowledge of the alleged act of discrimination. However, for good cause 
shown, GSA may extend this time limit.
    (b) GSA considers the date a complaint is filed to be the date upon 
which the complaint is sufficient to be processed.
    (c) GSA attempts to facilitate the filing of complaints if possible, 
including taking the following measures:
    (1) Accepting as a sufficient complaint, any written statement that 
identifies the parties involved and the date the complainant first had 
knowledge of the alleged violation, describes the action or practice 
complained of, and is signed by the complainant;
    (2) Freely permitting a complainant to add information to the 
complaint to meet the requirements of a sufficient complaint;
    (3) Notifying the complainant and the recipient (or their 
representative) of their right to contact GSA for information and 
assistance regarding the complaint resolution process.
    (d) GSA returns to the complainant any complaint outside the 
jurisdiction of this regulation, and states the reason(s) why it is 
outside the jurisdiction of the regulation.


<R05>
Sec. 101-8.717  Mediation.

    (a) GSA promptly refers to the mediation agency designated by the 
Secretary, HHS, all sufficient complaints that:
    (1) Fall within the jurisdiction of the Act and this regulation, 
unless the age distinction complained of is clearly within an exception; 
and
    (2) Contain the information needed for further processing.
    (b) Both the complainant and the recipient must participate in the 
mediation process to the extent necessary to reach an agreement or make 
an informed judgement that an agreement is not possible. Both parties 
need not meet with the mediator at the same time.
    (c) If the complainant and the recipient agree, the mediator will 
prepare a written statement of the agreement and have the complainant 
and the recipient sign it. The mediator must send a copy of the 
agreement to GSA. GSA takes no further action on the complaint unless 
the complainant or the recipient fails to comply with the agreement.
    (d) The mediator must protect the confidentiality of all information 
obtained in the course of the mediation. No mediator may testify in any 
adjudicative proceeding, produce any document, or otherwise disclose any 
information obtained in the course of the mediation process without 
prior approval of the head of the mediation agency.
    (e) The mediation proceeds for a maximum of 60 calendar days after a 
complaint is filed with GSA. Mediation ends if:
    (1) 60 calendar days elapse from the time the complaint is filed; or
    (2) Before the end of the 60 calendar-day period an agreement is 
reached; or
    (3) Before the end of that 60 calendar-day period, the mediator 
finds that an agreement cannot be reached.

    Note: The 60 calendar day period may be extended by the mediator, 
with the concurrence of GSA, for not more than 30 calendar days if the 
mediator determines that agreement is likely to be reached during the 
extension period.

    (f) The mediator must return unresolved complaints to GSA.


<R05>
Sec. 101-8.718  Investigation.

    (a) Informal investigation. GSA investigates complaints that are 
unresolved after mediation or are reopened because of a violation of a 
mediation agreement. As part of the initial investigation, GSA uses 
informal factfinding methods, including joint or separate discussions 
with the complainant and

[[Page 80]]

the recipient, to establish the fact and, if possible, settle the 
complaint on terms that are mutually agreeable to the parties. GSA may 
seek the assistance of any involved State program agency. GSA puts any 
agreement in writing and has it signed by the parties and an authorized 
official designated by the Administrator or the Director, Office of 
Organization and Personnel. The settlement may not affect the operation 
of any other enforcement efforts of GSA, including compliance reviews 
and investigation of other complaints that may involve the recipient. 
The settlement is not a finding of discrimination against a recipient.
    (b) Formal investigation. If GSA cannot resolve the complaint 
through informal investigation, it begins to develop formal findings 
through further investigation of the complaint. If the investigation 
indicates a violation of these regulations, GSA attempts to obtain 
voluntary compliance. If GSA cannot obtain voluntary compliance, it 
begins enforcement as described in Sec. 101-8.720.


<R05>
Sec. 101-8.719  Prohibition against intimidation or retaliation.

    A recipient may not engage in acts of intimidation or retaliation 
against any person who:
    (a) Attempts to assert a right protected by the Act of this 
regulation; or
    (b) Cooperates in any mediation, investigation, hearing, 
conciliation, and enforcement process.


<R05>
Sec. 101-8.720  Compliance procedure.

    (a) GSA may enforce the Act and these regulations through:
    (1) Termination of a recipient's Federal financial assistance from 
GSA under the program or activity involved where the recipient has 
violated the Act or this regulation. The determination of the 
recipient's violation may be made only after a recipient has had an 
opportunity for a hearing on the record before an administrative law 
judge.
    (2) Any other means authorized by law including, but not limited to:
    (i) Referral to the Department of Justice for proceeding to enforce 
any rights of the United States or obligations of the recipients created 
by the Act or this regulation, or
    (ii) Use of any requirement of or referral to any Federal, State, or 
local government agency that has the effect of correcting a violation of 
the Act or this regulation.
    (b) GSA limits any termination to the particular recipient and 
program or activity or part of such program and activity GSA finds in 
violation of this regulation. GSA does not base any part of a 
termination on a finding with respect to any program or activity of the 
recipient that does not receive Federal financial assistance from GSA.
    (c) GSA takes no action under paragraph (a) until:
    (1) The administrator advises the recipient of its failure to comply 
with the Act and this regulation and determines that voluntary 
compliance cannot be obtained, and
    (2) 30 calendar days elapse after the Administrator sends a written 
report of the grounds of the action to the committees of Congress having 
legislative jurisdiction over the Federal program or activity involved. 
The Administrator files a report if any action is taken under paragraph 
(a) of this section .
    (d) GSA may also defer granting new Federal financial assistance 
from GSA to a recipient when a hearing under Sec. 101-8.721 is 
initiated.
    (1) New Federal financial assistance from GSA includes all 
assistance for which GSA requires an application or approval, including 
renewal or continuation of existing activities, or authorization of new 
activities, during the deferral period. New Federal financial assistance 
from GSA does not include assistance approved before the beginning of a 
hearing.
    (2) GSA does not begin a deferral until the recipient receives 
notice of an opportunity for a hearing under Sec. 101-8.721. GSA does 
not continue a deferral for more than 60 calendar days unless a hearing 
begins within that time or the time for beginning the hearing is 
extended by mutual consent of the recipient and the Administrator. GSA 
does not continue a deferral for more than 30 calendar days after the 
close of the hearing, unless the hearing results in a finding against 
the recipient.

[[Page 81]]

    (3) GSA limits any deferral to the particular recipient and program 
or activity or part of such program or activity GSA finds in violation 
of these regulations. GSA does not base any part of a deferral on a 
finding with respect to any program or activity of the recipient which 
does not, and would not, receive Federal financial assistance from GSA.

Sec. 101-8.721  Hearings.

    (a) Opportunity for hearing. Whenever an opportunity for a hearing 
is required, reasonable notice shall be given by registered or certified 
mail, return receipt requested, to the affected applicant or recipient. 
This notice shall advise the applicant or recipient of the action 
proposed to be taken, the specific provision under which the proposed 
action against it is to be taken, and the matters of fact or law 
asserted as the basis for this action; and either fix a date not less 
than 20 days after the date of such notice within which the applicant or 
recipient may request of the responsible GSA official that the matter be 
scheduled for hearing or advise the applicant or recipient that the 
matter in question has been set down for hearing at a stated place and 
time. The time and place so fixed shall be reasonable and shall be 
subject to change for cause. The complainant, if any, shall be advised 
of the time and place of the hearing. An applicant or recipient may 
waive a hearing and submit written information and argument for the 
record. The failure of an applicant or recipient to request a hearing 
for which a data has been set shall be deemed to be a waiver of the 
right to a hearing under section 602 of the Act, and consent to the 
making of a decision on the basis of such information as may be filed as 
the record.
    (b) Time and place of hearing. Hearings shall be held at GSA in 
Washington, D.C., at a time fixed by the Director, Office of Civil 
Rights (OCR), unless he or she determines that the convenience of the 
applicant or recipient or of GSA requires that another place be 
selected. Hearings shall be held before a hearing examiner designated in 
accordance with 5 U.S.C. 3105 and 3344 (section 11 of the Administrative 
Procedure Act).
    (c) Right to counsel. In all proceedings under this section, the 
applicant or recipient and GSA shall have the right to be represented by 
counsel.
    (d) Procedures, evidence, and record. (1) The hearing, decision, and 
any administrative review thereof shall be conducted in conformity with 
sections 5-8 of the Administrative Procedure Act, and in accordance with 
such rules of procedure as are proper (and not inconsistent with this 
section) relating to the conduct of the hearing, giving of notices 
subsequent to those provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, 
taking of testimony, exhibits, arguments and briefs, requests for 
findings, and other related matters. Both GSA and the applicant or 
recipient shall be entitled to introduce all relevent evidence on the 
issues as stated in the notice for hearing or as determined by the 
Officer conducting the hearing at the outset of or during the hearings. 
Any person (other than a Government employee considered to be on 
official business) who, having been invited or requested to appear and 
testify as a witness on the Government's behalf, attends at a time and 
place scheduled for a hearing provided for by this part, may be 
reimbursed for his travel and actual expenses of attendance in an amount 
not to exceed the amount payable under the standardized travel 
regulations to a Government employee traveling on official business.
    (2) Technical rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings 
conducted pursuant to this part, but rules or principles designed to 
assure production of the most credible evidence available and to subject 
testimony to test by cross-examination shall be applied where reasonably 
necessary by the officer conducting the hearing. The hearing officer may 
exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence. All 
documents and other evidence offered or taken for the record shall be 
open to examination by the parties and opportunity shall be given to 
refute facts and arguments advances on either side of the issues. A 
transcript shall be made of the oral evidence except to the extent the 
substance thereof is stipulated for the record. All decisions shall be 
based upon the hearing record and written findings shall be made.

[[Page 82]]

    (e) Consolidated of Joint Hearings. In cases in which the the same 
or related facts are asserted to constitute non-compliance with this 
regulation with respect to two or more programs to which this part 
applies, or noncompliance with this part, and the regulations of one or 
more other Federal departments or agencies issued under title VI of the 
Act, the responsible GSA official may, by agreement with such other 
departments or agencies where applicable, provide for the conduct of 
consolidated or joint hearings, and for the application to such hearings 
of rules of procedures not inconsistent with this part. Final decisions 
in such cases, insofar as this regulation is concerned, shall be made in 
accordance with Sec. 101-8.722.


<R05>
Sec. 101-8.722  Decisions and notices.

    (a) Decisions by hearing examiners. After a hearing is held by a 
hearing examiner such hearing examiner shall either make an initial 
decision, if so authorized, or certify the entire record including his 
recommended findings and proposed decision to the Agency designated 
reviewing authority for final decision. A copy of such initial decision 
or certification shall be mailed to the applicant or recipient and to 
the complainant, if any. Where the initial decision referred to in this 
paragraph or in paragraph (c) of this section is made by the hearing 
examiner, the applicant or recipient or the counsel for GSA may, within 
the period provided for in the rules of procedure issued by GSA 
official, file with the reviewing authority exceptions to the initial 
decision, with his or her reasons therefore. Upon the filing of such 
exceptions the reviewing authority shall review the initial decision and 
issue a decision including the reasons therefor. In the absence of 
exceptions the initial decision shall constitute the final decision, 
subject to the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section.
    (b) Decisions on record or review by the reviewing authority. 
Whenever a record is certified to the reviewing authority for decision 
or it reviews the decision of a hearing examiner pursuant to paragraph 
(a) or (c) of this section, the applicant or recipient shall be given 
reasonable opportunity to file with it briefs or other written 
statements of its contentions, and a copy of the final decision of the 
reviewing authority shall be given in writing to the applicant or 
recipient and to the complainant, if any.
    (c) Decisions on record where a hearing is waived. Whenever a 
hearing is waived pursuant to Sec. 101-8.721(a) the reviewing authority 
shall make its final decision on the record or refer the matter to a 
hearing examiner for an initial decision to be made on the record. A 
copy of such decision shall be given in writing to the applicant or 
recipient, and to the complainant, if any.
    (d) Rulings required. Each decision of a hearing examiner or 
reviewing authority shall set forth a ruling on each findings, 
conclusion, or exception presented, and shall identify the requirement 
or requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part with which it is 
found that the applicant or recipient has failed to comply.
    (e) Review in certain cases by the Administrator. If the 
Administrator has not personally made the final decision referred to in 
paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section, a recipient or applicant or 
the counsel for GSA may request the Administrator to review a decision 
of the Reviewing Authority in accordance with rules of procedure issued 
by the responsible GSA official. Such review is not a matter of right 
and shall be granted only where the Administrator determines there are 
special and important reasons therefor. The Administrator may grant or 
deny such request, in whole or in part. He or she may also review such a 
decision in accordance with rules of procedure issued by the responsible 
GSA official. In the absence of a review under this paragraph, a final 
decision referred to in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) of this section shall 
become the final decision of GSA when the Administrator transmits it as 
such to Congressional committees with the report required under section 
602 of the Act. Failure of an applicant or recipient to file an 
exception with the Reviewing Authority or to request review under this 
paragraph shall not be deemed a failure to exhaust administrative 
remedies for the purpose of obtaining judicial review.

[[Page 83]]

    (f) Content of orders. The final decision may provide for suspension 
or termination of, or refusal to grant or continue Federal financial 
assistance, in whole or in part, to which this regulation applies, and 
may contain such terms, conditions and other provisions as are 
consistent with and will effectuate the purposes of the Act and this 
regulation, including provisions designed to assure that no Federal 
financial assistance to which this regulation applies will thereafter be 
extended under such law or laws to the applicant or recipient determined 
by such decision to be in default in its performance of an assurance 
given by it pursuant to this regulation, or to have otherwise failed to 
comply with this regulation unless and until it corrects its 
noncompliance and satisfies the responsible GSA official that it will 
fully comply with this regulation.
    (g) Post-termination proceedings. (1) An applicant or recipient 
adversely affected by an order issued under paragraph (f) of this 
section shall be restored to full eligibility to receive Federal 
financial assistance if it satisfies the terms and conditions of that 
order for such eligibility or if it brings itself into compliance with 
this part and provides reasonable assurance that is will fully comply 
with this part.
    (2) Any applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order 
entered pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section may at any time 
request the responsible GSA official to restore fully its eligibility to 
receive Federal financial assistance. Any such request shall be 
supported by information showing that the applicant or recipient has met 
the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. If the responsible 
GSA official determines that those requirements have been satisfied, he 
or she shall restore such eligibility.
    (3) If the responsible GSA official denies any such request, the 
applicant or recipient may submit a request for a hearing in writing, 
specifying why it believes such official to have been in error. It shall 
thereupon be given an expeditious hearing, with a decision on the 
record, in accordance with rules of procedure issued by the responsible 
GSA official. The applicant or recipient will be restored to such 
eligibility if it proves at such hearing that it satisfied the 
requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. While proceedings 
under this paragraph are pending, the sanctions imposed by the order 
issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall remain in effect.


<R05>
Sec. 101-8.723  Remedial action by recipient.

    If GSA finds a recipient discriminated on the basis of age, the 
recipient must take any remedial action that GSA may require to overcome 
the effects of the discrimination. If another recipient exercises 
control over the recipient that discriminated, GSA may require both 
recipients to take remedial action.


<R05>
Sec. 101-8.724  Exhaustion of administrative remedies.

    (a) A complainant may file a civil action following the exhaustion 
of administrative remedies under the Act. Administrative remedies are 
exhausted if:
    (1) 180 calendar days elapse after the complainant files the 
complaint and GSA makes no finding with regard to the complaint; or
    (2) GSA Issues a finding in favor of the recipient.
    (b) If GSA fails to make a finding within 180 days or issues a 
finding in favor of the recipient, GSA must:
    (1) Promptly advise the complainant of this fact;
    (2) Advise the complainant of his or her right to bring civil action 
for injunctive relief; and
    (3) Inform the complainant:
    (i) That the complainant may bring civil action only in a United 
States district court for the district in which the recipient is located 
or transacts business;
    (ii) That a complainant prevailing in a civil action has the right 
to be awarded the costs of the action, including reasonable attorney's 
fees, but that the complainant must demand these costs in the complaint;
    (iii) That before commencing the action the complainant must give 30 
calendar days notice by registered mail to the Secretary, HHS, The 
Administrator, the Attorney General of the United States, and the 
recipient;

[[Page 84]]

    (iv) That the notice must state the alleged violation of the Act, 
the relief requested, the court in which the complainant is bringing the 
action, and whether or not attorney's fees are demanded in the event the 
complainant prevails; and
    (v) That the complainant may not bring an action if the same alleged 
violation of the Act by the same recipient is the subject of a pending 
action in any court of the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 101-8.725  Alternate funds disbursal.

    If GSA withholds Federal financial assistance from a recipient under 
this regulation, the Administrator may disburse the assistance to an 
alternate recipient; any public or nonprofit private organization; or 
agency or State or political subdivision of the State. The Administrator 
requires any alternate recipient to demonstrate:
    (a) The ability to comply with this regulation; and
    (b) The ability to achieve the goals of the Federal Statutes 
authorizing the program or activity.

<R05>
Sec. 101-9.101  Authority.

    Section 2 of Public Law 94-575, the Federal Records Management 
Amendments of 1976 (FRMA), as amended, requires the Administrator of 
General Services to provide guidance and assistance to Federal agencies 
on records management, which includes the processing of mail by a 
Federal agency. GSA's responsibility extends to all Federal agencies.


<R05>

                 Subpart 101-9.2--Program Implementation


<R05>
Sec. 101-9.201  Agency responsibilities.

    The head of each agency, or his or her designee, must designate an 
agency mail manager to be responsible for establishing an agencywide 
mail management program. The agency mail manager must have visibility 
within the agency and be at a managerial level enabling him or her to 
execute an agencywide program. The responsibilities of the agency mail 
manager include:
    (a) Ensuring agencywide awareness and compliance with the mail 
management standards set forth by the U.S.

[[Page 86]]

Postal Service in the Domestic Mail Manual, the International Mail 
Manual, the Memo to Mailers, and the Postal Bulletin, as well as GSA 
standards and guidelines.
    (b) Negotiating on behalf of the agency with the U.S. Postal Service 
for mail related services and implementing operational procedures for 
services acquired from private delivery vendors and couriers.
    (c) Developing and distributing throughout the agency an agency mail 
cost control program. The agency cost control program must include, in 
addition to written policies regarding actions and procedures necessary 
to provide timely and cost-effective dispatch and delivery of mail, a 
plan for transition to automated mailing procedures, including: 
automated addressing, address list management, and electronic mail. This 
program must include:
    (1) Developing and issuing on an agencywide basis program 
directives, guidance, and policies for timely and cost-effective mail 
management. Copies of program directives, policies, and guidance must be 
available for inspection by GSA. This includes at a minimum:
    (i) Instructing mailers to use expedited mail only when required. 
Mail managers should require that mailers avoid excessive use of 
expedited mail services. Generally, expedited mail should not be used on 
Fridays, weekends, or the day before a holiday. When expedited mail is 
needed on Fridays, weekends, or the day before a holiday, the mail 
manager must coordinate with the mailer to ensure delivery to the 
addressee. For example, if the addressee's building will not be opened 
consider other delivery arrangements. The mail manager must establish 
control procedures including written instructions on cost-effective use 
of expedited mail and must review scheduled expedited mail dispatches to 
determine if expedited service is necessary. If expedited mail is not 
necessary, alternatives to be considered include, but are not limited 
to: First-Class and Priority Mail, from the U.S. Postal Service and 
package delivery services from other vendors, if the agency has the 
authority to contract for or enter into agreements with such vendors and 
in accordance with any existing contracts or agreements for such 
services to which the agency is a party.
    (ii) Maximizing agency cost-effective participation in worksharing 
programs. This includes proper address list management, compliance with 
automation addressing standards, presorting, and barcoding.
    (2) Monitoring through the agency's local mail managers at all mail 
facilities, mailings, and other mail management activities using onsite 
inspections, checklists, or other inspection/review methods.
    (3) Developing and directing agency programs and plans for proper 
use of transportation, equipment, and supply vendors, relative to mail 
management.
    (4) Maintaining records of agencywide volumes (in pieces) and agency 
postage expenditures (in dollars) by class, weight, special services, 
and subclass/rate category of mail. One consolidated report on outgoing 
mail volumes, postage expenditures, and mailable matter dispatched to 
all carriers must be maintained. (Suggested format appears in Sec. 101-
9.4902.)
    (5) Establishing procedures for the review and verification of 
vendor charges including charges contained in the U.S. Postal Service's 
Official Mail Accounting System billings. U.S. Postal Service charges 
and other vendor charges must be reviewed and verified at each facility 
to ensure billing accuracy.
    (6) Ensuring that facility mail managers increase their knowledge 
and skills in mail management on a continuing basis. Training sources 
include, but are not limited to: U.S. Postal Forums, Postal Customer 
Council meetings, and training offered by the GSA Interagency Training 
Center.


<R05>
Sec. 101-9.202  Operational cost control functions at the facility level.

    The following operations and procedures are applicable to all 
Federal mail centers, facilities, and offices that generate and process 
mail. Each facility must designate a mail manager. The facility mail 
manager is responsible for:
    (a) Reviewing, on a continuing basis, facility mail practices and 
procedures to identify opportunities for improvement and simplification.

[[Page 87]]

    (b) Providing centralized control at each facility of all mail 
processing activities including regularly scheduled and specialized mail 
messenger services, equipment, and personnel.
    (c) Providing training which:
    (1) Informs all levels of facility personnel on cost-effective 
mailing practices for incoming, internal, and outgoing mail.
    (2) Includes supplemental guidance and instruction in a format 
designed for easy reference, revision, and use by persons processing 
incoming, internal, and outgoing mail or using mail messenger 
operations. Such information must be distributed to all persons 
processing mail and users of mail messenger services.
    (d) Establishes a policy of and procedures for participation in the 
Cooperative Administrative Support Unit (CASU) program where applicable 
and when cost-effective. A CASU can typically provide pickup, sorting, 
and dispatch of mail through a CASU-managed mail center.
    (e) Where authorized, contracting for worksharing programs when mail 
volumes or lack of resources for proper mail preparation; e.g., 
presorting and barcoding, make contracting for worksharing the cost-
effective choice. Any solicitation for contracting for a mail center 
must require the contractor to comply with operational procedures of the 
agency mail cost control program.
    (f) Conducting discussions with local U.S. Postal Service for mail 
related services and implementing operational procedures for services 
acquired from mail delivery vendors or couriers.
    (g) Processing mail by class with expedited mail, First-Class, and 
Priority Mail being processed before lower classes of mail.
    (h) Attempting to deliver mail to the action office (the office 
responsible for taking action on the mail once it is received) within 6 
hours after it is received by the agency from the carrier. Every attempt 
should be made to deliver mail to the address or addressee's office; 
however, incoming bulk business rate mail addressed to an individual may 
be discarded if the facility cannot readily ascertain the name or 
whereabouts of the addressee. Incoming First-Class mail that cannot be 
delivered must be returned to the sender, per the U.S. Postal Service's 
Domestic Mail Manual.
    (i) Reporting unauthorized use of agency postage including penalty 
or commercial mail stamps, meter impressions, or other postage indicia 
immediately upon discovery to the agency Inspector General or internal 
security office, as appropriate.
    (j) Reporting mail center deviations from the agency's occupational, 
safety and health program, in accordance with 29 CFR part 1960 and 29 
CFR part 1910.
    (k) Establishing and implementing procedures to ensure that mail 
complies with U.S. Postal Service addressing standards which include 
automated and electronically generated mailing addresses in order to 
eliminate as many handwritten addresses as possible. Compliance includes 
ensuring machine readability, proper formatting, use of directionals (N. 
Main St., 4th St., NW, etc.), and accurate mail preparation for the 
various classes and discount rates and/or for the best possible delivery 
service. The U.S. Postal Service publications (Domestic Mail Manual, 
International Mail Manual, Memo to Mailers, and the Postal Bulletins) 
contain all U.S. Postal Service regulations for proper mail preparation 
and dispatch, and must be utilized at each location where outgoing mail 
is processed.
    (l) Establishing and reviewing annually in conjunction with the 
agency security office, a mail security program to ensure appropriate 
security requirements while not creating undue delay in mail processing. 
The mail security program must, at a minimum, detail policy and 
procedures for safe and secure facility operations and for the safe 
transportation and processing of mail.
    (m) Reviewing, prior to the creation of the pieces to be dispatched, 
all mailings which will (i) consist of 200 or more pieces, or (ii) weigh 
50 or more pounds, including mail to be dispatched on behalf of the 
agency by a third party, for example, the Government Printing Office, to 
ensure that the agency's needs are met at the lowest

[[Page 88]]

possible cost. Mail managers will coordinate with agency printing 
specialists about the mailing portion of contracted printing jobs prior 
to entering into a printing agreement.
    (n) Establishing and publishing the facility's mail delivery and 
pickup times, based on need for service, established through the study 
of mail volumes and service requirements. The facility mail manager's 
goal is to provide service to the facility at the lowest possible cost. 
Consistency in mail pickup and delivery can help achieve the goal.
    (o) Maintaining close liaison with agency correspondence managers 
and providing guidance on correspondence management decisions such as 
the development and design of mailing materials including: Business 
Reply Mail, letterhead, mailing labels, and envelope design.
    (p) Notifying facility personnel that personal incoming, internal, 
and outgoing mail may not be processed in agency facilities. An 
exception may be granted at a facility for personnel living on the 
facility, personnel stationed outside the United States, or other 
situations where agency/facility personnel would otherwise suffer 
hardship.

    GSA will acquire and use federally owned and leased office buildings 
and space located in the United States and will issue standards and 
criteria for the use of this space. GSA will assign and reassign this 
space to Federal agencies and certain non-Federal organizations. GSA has 
oversight responsibility for Federal agency compliance with Executive 
Order 12072, including space acquisition in urban areas accomplished 
under authority other than the Federal Property and Administrative 
Services Act of 1949, as amended. As required by section 901(b) of the 
Agriculture Act of 1970, 84 Stat. 1383, as amended by section 601 of the 
Rural Development Act of 1972, 86 Stat. 674 (42 U.S.C. 1322(b)), it is 
the responsibility of each agency to determine which of its new offices 
should be located in rural areas. When it is determined that agency 
space needs require an urban location, GSA and other Federal agencies 
shall be governed by the following policies for the assignment, 
reassignment, and use of buildings and space.
    (a) Federal facilities and Federal use of space in urban areas shall 
serve to strengthen the Nation's cities and to make them attractive 
places to live and work. Federal space shall conserve existing urban 
resources and encourage the development and redevelopment of cities.

[[Page 96]]

    (b) Serious consideration shall be given to the impact that a 
location or relocation will have on improving the social, economic, 
environmental, and cultural conditions of the communities in an urban 
area. To the extent feasible, plans and programs for meeting space needs 
shall enhance and support the development, redevelopment, and 
revitalization objectives and priorities of cities in urban areas and 
shall enhance and support the employment and economic base of these 
cities. Both positive and negative impacts of space acquisition actions 
shall be weighed with the objective of obtaining maxmum socioeconomic 
benefits from these actions.
    (c) In meeting space needs in urban areas:
    (1) First consideration shall be given to a centralized business 
area and adjacent areas of similar character in the central city of 
Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas (SMSA) defined by the Department 
of Commerce publication (Government Printing Office Stock Number 041-
001-00101-8), including other specific areas of a city recommended by 
the elected chief executive officer of the local government or a 
designee, except where this type of consideration is otherwise 
prohibited. Space needs will be met outside the central business area of 
a central city of an SMSA only when one of the following circumstances 
exist:
    (i) The service area of an activity is limited to a clearly defined 
sector of a city or a suburban or rural community, as is the case with 
satellite or branch offices; or where onsite activities are involved, 
such as inspection and/or maintenance operations at border stations, 
airports, seaports, or other similar activities;
    (ii) Immediate compliance is not possible due to existing leasing 
commitments in areas outside the central business area (CBA). In these 
cases, plans for the future compliance shall be made; i.e., the activity 
shall be relocated to the central business area upon expiration of the 
lease;
    (iii) The proposed facility or the activity's use of a facility is 
not in compliance with local land use or zoning ordinances; or
    (iv) The elected chief executive officer of the local government or 
a designee advises the agency that an activity or facility should be 
located in an area of the central city other than the CBA.
    (2) If location outside the central business area of the central 
city is required, preference shall be given to location within the 
central city.
    (3) If location outside the central city is required, preference 
shall be given to locations in the central business area of noncentral 
cities.
    (4) If location outside an SMSA is required, preference shall be 
given to central business area of non-SMSA cities.
    (d) Decisions to relocate activities from existing noncentral 
business area locations into the central business area shall take into 
consideration an analysis of the comparative costs in relationship to 
the anticipated benefits of the proposed relocation. These cost/benefit 
analysis shall compare the costs of relocation into the central business 
area to the costs of alternative locations that would be delineated were 
there no plans to relocate the activity into the central business area. 
In conducting cost/benefit analyses the following steps shall be 
followed:
    (1) An estimate of the comparative costs of a central business area 
location versus the costs of non-CBA locations shall be made, including 
an analysis of:
    (i) The estimated annual per-square-foot market rent for comparable 
space in the central business area versus similar estimated market rents 
for delineated noncentral business area locations under consideration, 
plus
    (ii) The estimated per-square-foot costs of duplicating permanent 
special-type alterations (such as laboratory or ADP space) amortized 
over the term of the lease and all renewal options; plus
    (iii) The estimated per-square-foot cost of relocating offices to 
the various alternative locations, including the central business area 
amortized over the term of the lease and all renewal options, and
    (iv) The estimated per-square-foot cost of residential relocation of 
employees, eligible for relocation under

[[Page 97]]

the Federal Travel Regulations (FPMR 101-7), who will likely apply for 
relocation. (These costs also will be amortized over the term of the 
lease and all renewal options.)
    (2) The sum of the cost factors listed in paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section shall be computed for each alternative location considered, 
including the central business area location. If the annual per-square-
foot cost of locating into the central business area does not exceed by 
a margin of 15 percent of the per-square-foot cost of those alternative 
locations outside the central business area, relocation shall be 
accomplished without further study.
    (3) When the per-square-foot costs of relocating an activity into 
the central business area exceeds by a margin of 15 percent the costs 
per square foot of the alternative noncentral business area locations, 
further study shall be conducted to identify anticipated intangible 
benefits to the Government and the urban area involved by relocating 
into the central business area. The assistance and advice of the local 
government may be solicited during this phase of analysis. This phase of 
analysis shall include, as appropriate, but not be limited to the 
identification of all benefits accruing to the Government and the local 
community as follows:
    (i) The influence a relocation will have on any established plan of 
the city to develop or redevelop the central business area. This factor 
shall include consideration of the extent to which the plan has been or 
will be implemented locally through Federal financial assistance and 
other positive commitments by the local community and an assessment of 
the prospects for success of the plan;
    (ii) The impact of the proposed action on the affected office space 
rental markets;
    (iii) The extent to which the accessibility of low and moderate 
income housing on a nondiscrimination basis and nondiscrimination in the 
sale and rental of residential housing for Federal employees will be 
improved;
    (iv) The extent to which the accessibility of the central business 
area location to all segments of the population of the community served 
will be improved;
    (v) The availability of parking and public transportation for 
employees and visitors to the central business area location; and
    (vi) All other identified benefits particularly applicable to the 
local situation.
    (4) Data gathered in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(3) of this section 
shall be used to reach a final decision on a proposed relocation into a 
central business area.
    (5) In communities in which it is determined there is the potential 
for substantial relocations of agencies into the central business area 
over a medium ranged period of time (3 to 5 years), the GSA regional 
office may conduct a cost/benefit analysis on the cumulative impact of 
relocating agencies into the central business area over the planning 
period rather than on a case-by-case basis. These analyses will be 
conducted as described above. Any action taken during the planning 
period consistent with the conclusions of the cost/benefit analysis will 
not require an individual analysis. Periodic reviews of long-range cost/
benefit analyses will be made as appropriate.
    (e) Whenever the regional Public Buildings Service determines that 
it is impractical to locate a Federal activity consistent with the 
policy of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, it must obtain approval by 
the Regional Administrator of a waiver of the policy for the particular 
space action. These waivers may be granted for temporary periods because 
of local real estate market conditions or permanently, but must be based 
on documented facts, such as cost/benefit analyses described in 
paragraph (d) of this section.
    (f) In SMSA's with more than one central city, or in urban areas 
with more than one city, GSA may make new space assignments in the 
central business area of the most distressed city. In addition, 
consideration may be given to meeting space needs in other than central 
cities when the following conditions exist: (1) A city in an SMSA is not 
a central city but has over 50,000 population and (2) the level of 
distress

[[Page 98]]

in that city is determined by the Secretary of Housing and Urban 
Development to be equal to or greater than any of the central cities.
    (g) Consistent with the policies cited in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), 
(d), and (f) of this section, consideration shall be given to the 
following criteria in meeting Federal space needs in urban areas:
    (1) Impact on economic development and employment opportunities in 
the urban area, including use of human, natural, cultural, and community 
resources with the objective of targeting distressed areas;
    (2) Compatibility of the site with State, regional, or local 
development, redevelopment, or conservation objectives;
    (3) Conformity with the activities and objectives of other Federal 
agencies;
    (4) Availability of adequate low- and moderate-income housing on a 
nondiscriminatory basis for employees and nondiscrimination in the sale 
and rental of housing; and
    (5) Availability of adequate public transportation and parking and 
accessibility to the public.
    (h) The presence of the Federal Government in the National Capital 
Region is such that the distribution of Federal installations has been 
and will continue to be a major influence in the extent and character of 
development. In the interest of order and economy, and in view of the 
special nature of the National Capital Region, these policies shall be 
applied in the National Capital Region in conjunction with regional 
policies on development and distribution of Federal employment 
established by the National Capital Planning Commission and consistent 
with the general purposes of the National Capital Planning Act of 1952, 
as amended.
    (i) Consistent with the policies cited in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), 
(d), and (f) of this section, alternative sources will be considered in 
meeting Federal space needs in urban areas in the following order:
    (1) Availability of existing federally controlled facilities. 
Maximum use will be made of the facilities that, in the judgment of the 
Administrator of General Services, are adequate or economically 
adaptable to meeting the space needs of executive agencies;
    (2) Use of buildings of historic, architectural, or cultural 
significance within the meaning of section 105 of the Public Buildings 
Cooperative Use Act of 1976 (90 Stat. 2507);
    (3) Acquisition or use of existing privately owned facilities; and
    (4) Construction of new facilities.
    (j) Site selection and space assignment shall take into account:
    (1) The management needs for consolidation of agencies or activities 
in common or adjacent space to improve management and administration and 
effect economies; and
    (2) The efficient performance of the missions and programs of the 
agencies, the nature and function of the facilities involved, the 
convenience of the public served, and the maintenance of safe and 
healthful working conditions for employees.
    (k) To the maximum extent feasible, GSA will maintain continuous 
liaison with the elected chief executive officer of local government or 
a designee to obtain advice and consultation with respect to space 
assignment, acquisition, and construction activities in the community. 
To establish the framework for consultation on space actions, GSA will 
seek agreements with local governments, which shall:
    (1) Establish acceptable geographic boundaries of the central 
business area;
    (2) Identify areas of the city outside the central business area 
targeted for development or redevelopment that would benefit from the 
stimulus of the location of Federal space;
    (3) Define the types and sizes of GSA projects of interest to local 
government;
    (4) Establish appropriate timing for notifying local officials of a 
GSA project;
    (5) Advise local officials of the availability of data on GSA plans 
and programs, and agree upon the exchange of planning information with 
local officials;
    (6) Identify appropriate timing for periodic reviews of the 
agreement to ensure it is providing maximum consultation; and
    (7) Include other appropriate information.

[[Page 99]]

    (l) Federal facilities and Federal use of space in rural areas shall 
serve to strengthen the Nation's rural communities. Federal space shall 
encourage growth and economic development and redevelopment in rural 
areas. Consistent with the provisions of section 601(b) of the Rural 
Development Act of 1972 (86 Stat. 674), each agency shall give first 
priority to meeting Federal space needs in rural areas.
    (m) In meeting space needs in rural areas:
    (1) First consideration shall be given to the central business area 
of incorporated jurisdictions, including adjacent areas of similar 
character and specific areas recommended by local officials, except 
where this type of consideration is prohibited.
    (2) Serious consideration shall be given to the impact a site 
selection will have on improving the social, economic, environmental, 
and cultural conditions of the communities in a rural area. To the 
extent feasible, plans and programs for meeting space needs shall 
enhance and support the development, redevelopment, and revitalization 
objectives and priorities of communities in rural areas, as well as 
enhance and support the employment and economic base of these 
communities. Both positive and negative impacts of space acquisition 
actions shall be weighed with the objective of obtaining maximum 
socioeconomic benefits from these actions.
    (3) In rural areas with more than one incorporated jurisdiction, 
space assignments shall be made in the most distressed jurisdiction.
    (4) Space needs shall be met outside the central business area only 
when one of the exceptions contained in paragraphs (c)(1) (i), (ii), 
(iii), or (iv) of this section apply or in the case of county level 
field offices of USDA when the program requirements and needs of their 
clientele preclude locations in the central business area. The 
assignment and acquisition of facilities and space to house the 
activities of the U.S. Department of Agriculture are further defined in 
the USDA/GSA agreement in Sec. 101-17-4701.
    (n) Consistent with the policies cited in paragraphs (l) and (m) of 
this section, the site selection criteria contained in paragraph (j) of 
this section, and the alternative space acquisition methods contained in 
paragraph (i) of this section shall be considered. In addition, 
consultation with local officials in rural areas shall be consistent 
with the requirements of paragraph (k) of this section.
    (o) In accordance with the joint White House/Office of Management 
and Budget memorandum, dated March 9, 1979, heads of executive agencies 
that acquire or use federally owned or leased space under authority 
other than the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, 
as amended, shall notify the appropriate GSA Regional Administrator 
before taking an irreversible action to acquire or use space when this 
action is inconsistent with the basic policies of paragraphs (a), (b), 
(c), (d), (f), (g), (h), (i), (j), (k), (l), (m), and (n) of this 
section.
    (1) Notification shall include the:
    (i) Description of the nature of the activity to be housed, type and 
amount of space involved, and number of employees to be housed;
    (ii) Discussion and analysis of alternatives studies;
    (iii) Documentation of advice received from local government;
    (iv) Copy of the environmental assessment of the proposed action; 
and
    (v) Citation of any statutory restrictions that preclude compliance 
with the above-referenced paragraphs of this section.
    (2) Within 30 calendar days of receipt of the agency notification, 
the Regional Administrator shall notify the agency head in writing of 
concurrence with the proposed action. If the Regional Administrator does 
not concur with the proposed action, the Regional Administrator shall 
explain any objections in writing to the agency. The Administrator of 
General Services will notify the Director of the Office of Management 
and Budget of the basis for nonconcurrence.

Sec. 101-17.003-27  Occupiable area.

    Occupiable area means that portion of the gross area which is 
available for use by an occupant's personnel or furnishings, including 
space which is available jointly to the various occupants of the 
building, such as auditoriums, health units, and snack bars. Occupiable 
area does not include that space in the building which is devoted to its 
operations and maintenance, including craft shops, gear rooms, and 
building supply storage and issue rooms. Nonpermanent ceiling-high 
corridors solely serving a single space assignment and permanent 
corridors restricted for the security purposes of a single space 
assignment are occupiable. Occupiable area is computed by measuring from 
the occupant's side of ceiling-high corridor partitions or partitions 
enclosing mechanical, toilet, and/or custodial space to the inside 
finish of permanent exterior building walls or to the face of the 
convector if the convector occupies at least 50 percent of the length of 
the exterior wall. When computing occupiable area separated by 
partitions, measurements are taken from the center line of such 
partitions.

are applicable to the assignment of space to Federal agencies and other 
entities entitled to occupy space in Government-owned and -leased 
buildings.


<R05>
Sec. 101-17.101  Requests for space.

    (a) Except as provided in Sec. 101-17.101-2, Federal agencies shall 
satisfy their space needs by submitting a Standard Form 81, Request for 
Space, to the GSA regional office responsible for the geographic area in 
which the space is required. A listing of GSA regional offices and the 
areas they service is shown in Sec. 101-17.4801.
    (b) Heads of executive agencies shall:
    (1) Cooperate with and assist the Administrator of General Services 
in carrying out the Administrator's responsibilities with respect to 
buildings and space, recognizing the requirement that primary 
consideration be given to locating within the central business area in 
urban areas
    (2) Give the Administrator of General Services early notice of new 
or changing space requirements;
    (3) Economize in their requirements for space; and
    (4) Review continuously their needs for space in and near the 
District of Columbia, taking into account the feasibility of 
decentralizing services or activities which can be accomplished 
elsewhere in the Nation without excessive costs or significant loss of 
efficiency.

<R05>
Sec. 101-17.101-1  Form of request.

    Space requests, except those for space in proposed buildings 
included in the Public Buildings Construction Program, shall be 
submitted on Standard Form 81, Revised, Request for Space. (See 
Sec. 101-17.4901-81, Request for Space). Requests for space in buildings 
proposed for construction shall be submitted to GSA on GSA Form 144, 
Space Requirements. (See Sec. 101-17.4902-144.)


<R05>
Sec. 101-17.101-1a  Type of request.

    The type of request shall be indicated on Standard Form 81, Request 
for Space.
    (a) An initial request means a request for space in a location where 
an agency does not presently occupy any space or where space is required 
for new agencies or new missions of existing agencies.
    (b) A supplemental request means a request for space in a location 
where an agency already occupies space but needs additional space to 
provide for expanding program responsibilities.
    (c) A replacement request means a request for space to replace that 
occupied by an agency as a result of a relocation or a consolidation of 
agency activities.


<R05>
Sec. 101-17.101-1b  Certification of request.

    The need for space requested, the number of personnel listed, and 
the availability of funds, as appropriate, for reimbursement to GSA 
shall be certified by an authorized official of the requesting agency on 
the Standard Form 81. When applicable, the certification will also state 
that the request is in compliance with Secs. 101-17.103, 101-18.107, and 
101-19.101 which require the requesting agency to submit documentation 
that the availability of low and middle income housing in the delineated 
area has been cleared with the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development.


<R05>
Sec. 101-17.101-2  Exceptions to submitting requests for space.

    Standard Form 81 need not be filed by Federal agencies when the 
space desired or to be acquired is:
    (a) General purpose space of 2,500 square feet or less falling 
within the geographical area where leasing authority has been delegated 
to the agency. (See Sec. 101-18.104.)
    (b) Special purpose space of 2,500 square feet or less irrespective 
of geographical location.
    (c) Space acquired by the U.S. Postal Service.

[[Page 106]]

    (d) Space for short-term conferences and meetings. (See Sec. 101-
17.101-4.)


<R05>
Sec. 101-17.101-3  Action when space is not available.

    If no suitable Government-controlled space is available, GSA will so 
advise the requesting agency by the return of a signed copy of the 
Standard Form 81, showing thereon the action to be taken.
    (a) When the agency has acquisition authority or has been delegated 
such authority by the Administrator of General Services it may thereupon 
proceed to acquire the requested space. The signed copy of the Standard 
Form 81 shall be attached to the leasing or related instrument made 
available to the General Accounting Office. Such clearances are extended 
on a fiscal year or part of a fiscal year basis, except in these 
instances in which the acquiring activity uses longer term leasing 
authority.
    (b) GSA may take necessary action to acquire space for agencies 
having acquisition authority when the latter so request by checking the 
appropriate block on Standard Form 81.
    (c) GSA will take the necessary action to acquire the space for 
agencies having no acquisition authority.


<R05>
Sec. 101-17.101-4  Short-term use of conference and meeting facilities.

    Agencies having a need for facilities for short-term conferences and 
meetings shall contact GSA informally to make their requirements known. 
GSA will determine if suitable Government-owned facilities are available 
in the desired area and, if so, will notify the requesting agency of its 
assignment. If no suitable facilities are available, GSA will assist or 
advise agencies in arranging for the use of privately owned facilities 
when agencies have authority to contract by purchase order or other 
means. Payment for use of privately owned conference or meeting rooms 
is, in fact, payment for the services and furnishings that are provided. 
Such services and furnishings, in addition to the facilities 
(auditorium, conference room, meeting room, etc.), would include chairs 
(already placed as requested by the user), rostrum with tables and 
chairs, posting of notices on appropriate building bulletin board, 
amplifier system, screen and motion picture projector, and other special 
equipment needed. GSA may obtain privately owned conference and meeting 
facilities by service contract on an hourly rate basis where combined 
requirements of the Federal agencies in a particular area would justify 
an open end service contract for such space for intermittent use periods 
or for an extended period of time.


<R05>
Sec. 101-17.101-5  Space requirements for ADP equipment.

    (a) Agencies requiring space for the installation of data processing

                 Subpart 101-17.2--Utilization of Space


<R05>
Sec. 101-17.200  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart prescribes the principles and objectives of GSA in 
regard to the full and efficient utilization of Government-controlled 
space. The efficient utilization of space is closely related to the 
assignment functions of GSA, and, therefore, this subpart shall be 
considered in the light of the policies and procedures in subpart 101-
17.1, Assignment of Space.


<R05>
Sec. 101-17.201  Responsibility of GSA.

    (a) GSA will assign agencies sufficient space to carry out their 
programs, provided that the need for such space is justified to the 
satisfaction of GSA.
    (b) GSA will conduct space inspections and space utilization surveys 
to promote and enforce efficient utilization, recapturing for release or 
reassignment any space which the agencies do not justify to the 
satisfaction of GSA as being required. Adequate advance notice of the 
planned survey will be given to the agency concerned.


<R05>
Sec. 101-17.201-1  Conduct of space inspections.

    GSA will plan space inspections at periodic intervals on a 
community, building, or agency basis as appropriate. Inspections will be 
made in an orderly manner, on the basis of a floor-by-floor and room-by-
room check of all assigned space. The agency will be provided with a 
written summary of significant findings and recommendations, together 
with data concerning improvements which can be effected by the agency, 
and those which are planned by GSA.


<R05>
Sec. 101-17.201-2  Conduct of space utilization surveys.

    Space utilization surveys are made to ascertain whether a current 
assignment can be made more efficient and economical. These surveys may 
be scheduled as a result of a request for space, an action to improve 
utilization, an assignment action requiring a relocation of an activity, 
or as a result of a space inspection. Agencies will be kept informed of 
space utilization surveys and actions related thereto by the appropriate 
GSA regional office listed in Sec. 101-17.4801.


<R05>
Sec. 101-17.202  Responsibility of agencies.

    It is the responsibility of the agencies to assist and cooperate 
with GSA in the assignment and utilization of space, including the 
furnishing of data relative to the use of the space occupied, and 
personnel housed or to be housed. It is the further responsibility of 
the agencies continuously to study and survey space occupied under 
assignment by GSA and other space which is controlled by the agencies, 
to insure efficient and economical space utilization. It is also the 
responsibility of those agencies which control space to report to GSA 
any space which is excess to their needs and which might be assigned to 
other agencies.


<R05>
Sec. 101-17.203  Release of space not fully utilized.

    The space utilization program is designed to effect maximum 
efficient utilization of Government-controlled space. Space for which 
there is no current foreseeable need will be relinquished.


<R05>
Sec. 101-17.204  Notice to GSA of relinquishment of assigned space.

    (a) GSA shall be notified by an agency occupying space assigned by 
GSA at least 120 days prior to the date on which the space, or portion 
thereof, will no longer be needed. In no event, however, shall such 
notice be given less than 30 days prior to the date on which a lease 
termination notice must be issued. Such notification shall be submitted 
in writing to the GSA regional office responsible for the geographical 
area in which the space is located, giving a description of the area 
involved, its location and the estimated date of release. When a portion 
of space is released, it must be consolidated and accessible for 
reassignment. Any alteration required to make such space consolidated 
and accessible will be borne by the agency before the space is assumed 
by GSA. The appropriate GSA regional office may reassign or dispose of 
the space.
    (b) When an agency is responsible for operation, maintenance, and 
protection

[[Page 110]]

of Government-owned space to which it has been assigned by GSA, and the 
agency determines that such space, or a portion thereof, is no longer 
needed, the agency shall so notify GSA at least 6 months prior to 
relinquishing the space in the same manner as indicated in paragraph (a) 
of this section. The operation, protection, and maintenance of the real 
property or portion thereof to be released shall continue to be the 
responsibility of the agency until the first day of the fiscal quarter 
after the 6-month period ends.

Sec. 101-17.302  Use of occupancy guides.

    The objectives of the occupancy guide program are to improve agency 
operations and promote economic and prudent utilization of Government-
controlled space through the development and application of occupancy 
standards and criteria for specific agencies and activities. Each 
occupancy guide represents an agreement between GSA and the agency as to 
the latter's space requirements and is written in terms which permit 
nationwide application. The criteria contained in occupancy guides will 
be used as a basis for estimating agency space requirements for those 
agencies for which guides have been published and allowances are 
considered to be maximum. Occupancy guides will be reviewed jointly by 
GSA and the agencies and revised to conform with the allowances 
contained in this subpart 101-17.3.


<R05>
Sec. 101-17.303  Use of space allocation allowances.

    (a) The space allowances listed in Secs. 101-17.304-1 and 101-
17.304-2 are to be used in space planning for agencies or components 
thereof for which occupancy guides have not been published. In addition, 
these allowances are applicable for all agency headquarters activities.
    (b) Work station space allowances listed in Sec. 101-17.304-1 shall 
not necessarily be used as criteria for assigning space to individuals. 
Rather, they should be used to estimate that portion of the total office 
space that is required for work stations.


<R05>
Sec. 101-17.304  Office space allowances.

    The amount of office space developed by application of these 
allowances should normally be sufficient to house office elements of 
executive agencies. It is recognized, however, that agency functions and 
needs and physical variations in buildings will cause deviations in the 
determination of the amount of space assigned, and its division into 
private, semiprivate, open areas, or other uses will be based upon a 
templated layout which reflects the optimum use of the space and the 
workflow requirements of the using agency.

Sec. 101-17.304-2  Administrative support space allowances.

    The following space allowance table is to be used in determining the 
amount of administrative support space required in office space 
planning. Although work stations may be interspersed in administrative 
support areas, allowances for administrative support areas may not be 
added to allowances for work stations except where support area 
furniture exceeds the capacity of the work station area.

<R05>
Sec. 101-17.305  Storage space allowances.

    Storage space shall be estimated by application of the allowances in 
Sec. 101-17.304-2 where standard storage equipment (file cabinets, 
shelving, and safes) is used. When such is not the case (such as bulk 
storage of furniture, equipment, and supplies), a careful estimate of 
the space requirement must be made by onsite inspection, giving due 
consideration to warehousing techniques.


<R05>
Sec. 101-17.306  Special space allowances.

    To the extent possible, space for special use shall be estimated on 
the basis of specialized standards, such as those for laboratory 
equipment. Distributors of specialized equipment can readily provide 
information on space required to house particular items of equipment, 
and their advice should be sought whenever possible. The criteria 
contained in Sec. 101-17.304 may be used to estimate space required for 
conference rooms, classrooms, and training rooms.


<R05>
Sec. 101-17.307  Private office space allowances.

    Private offices should be provided only when there is a demonstrated 
functional need. They should be only large enough for the occupant to 
conduct his normal business in an efficient manner and with a reasonable 
degree of dignity. The normal maximum allowance for private offices is 
300 square feet, but this should be considered only in instances in 
which it is necessary for the occupant to confer frequently with sizable 
groups of people, and a conference room is not convenient.


<R05>
Sec. 101-17.308  Supplemental space standards for Government executives.

    The standards in Secs. 101-17.308-1 and 101-17.308-2 are prescribed 
for use in the assignment of space to executive schedule personnel 
(levels I through V) and supergrade employees (GS 16, GS 17, and GS 18). 
In implementing and

[[Page 112]]

using these standards, the following criteria apply:
    (a) These standards are used in estimating that portion of the total 
office space required for executive work stations, and as such are 
considered neither maximums nor minimums except where so noted. A degree 
of latitude is necessary, depending on building configuration, 
functional and operational needs, and the best interests of the 
Government.
    (b) These standards shall not be retroactively applied to justify 
additional space or improvements for existing offices, nor shall they be 
used to reduce current assignments which exceed the allotments. 
Compliance with the standards shall be achieved through new assignments 
and reassignments which take place as a result of normal turnover of 
office space and facilities.
    (c) Alterations and amenities allowed by these standards, but which 
exceed GSA standard levels of alteration, shall be reimbursable to GSA 
by the Agency involved.
    (d) If they so desire, individual Agencies may adopt more stringent 
standards for their executives and apply such in-house allocations to 
their requests for space.
    (e) High-level military personnel housed in GSA-controlled space 
shall be subject to application of these standards at the civilian level 
to which their rank is equivalent.
    (f) In the interest of using the public dollar judiciously, 
Government executives are expected to exercise restraint in furnishing 
and equipping their offices. Since much can be accomplished by the use 
of currently available furnishings, ``built-ins'' and other unusual 
alterations should be kept to a minimum. All alterations and amenities 
not detailed herein should meet the test of reasonable cost.
    (g) As long as an office is in good repair and suitable to the 
function of the executive position to which it is assigned, it is GSA's 
policy to discourage personal preferential modifications with a change 
in occupant.

<R05>
Sec. 101-17.400  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart outlines the methods used in the planning and layout of 
space assignments and prescribes the conditions governing GSA--agency 
coordination.


<R05>
Sec. 101-17.401  Space planning assistance.

    GSA shall be responsible for preparing the initial space layout. 
When an agency requires subsequent space layout assistance, a request 
for such assistance should be made to the regional

[[Page 114]]

office of GSA responsible for the geographical area in which the space 
is located. In consultation with the agency, GSA will determine the 
scope of assistance required and will provide such service on a 
reimbursable basis either by use of existing staff or by contract.


<R05>
Sec. 101-17.402  Use of contractual services for space planning.

    No Federal agency shall, without the written approval of GSA, enter 
into a contract for interior office design or space layout, with any 
non-Federal firm or individual. When it is determined that a contract is 
required, GSA, with the advice of the agency, will enter into the 
contract and supervise the contractor's performance. The contract will 
be completely reimbursable by the requesting agency except when it 
covers the initial space layout.

        Subpart 101-17.5--Providing Space in New Public Buildings


<R05>
Sec. 101-17.500  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart prescribes the procedures and objectives governing 
space planning for new public buildings.


<R05>
Sec. 101-17.501  General.

    Modern space layout principles, which contribute to good space 
management and operational efficiency, are particularly appropriate in 
the case of new public buildings. Full coordination, strict observance 
of the design schedule, and followup action are required to insure 
maximum return to the Government in terms of efficiency and economy.


<R05>
Sec. 101-17.502  Responsibility of GSA.

    GSA will be responsible for the space planning and layout in all new 
public buildings. Regional offices of GSA will forward layout plans to 
occupant agencies for review and coordination and, at the same time, 
notify the agencies of the date beyond which design changes cannot be 
accepted.


<R05>
Sec. 101-17.503  Responsibility of agencies.

    Agencies are responsible for making their needs known to GSA on a 
timely basis; providing cooperation and assistance if required in the 
preparation of space layouts; and requesting necessary changes prior to 
the design cutoff date. (See also Sec. 101-19.204.)


<R05>
Sec. 101-17.504  Postoccupancy evaluation.

    GSA will conduct a postoccupancy evaluation of major new public 
buildings approximately 6 months after the date of occupancy. This 
evaluation, which will take the form of space inspections or space 
utilization surveys as described in subpart 101-17.2, Utilization of 
Space, will be conducted to economy.

Sec. 101-17.4701  Memorandum of understanding between the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the General Services Administration concerning the location of 
          Federal facilities.

 Memorandum of Understanding Between U.S. Department of Agriculture and 
   General Services Administration Concerning the Location of Federal 
                               Facilities

    Purpose. The purpose of this Memorandum of Understanding is to 
provide an effective arrangement whereby the Department of Agriculture 
and the General Services Administration will cooperate to implement the 
National Urban Policy. This memorandum requires that in urban areas and 
incorporated rural communities, offices and facilities of the Department 
will be located in central business areas whenever such location is 
consistent with program requirements.
    1. The President's March 27, 1978, message on urban policy included 
a directive to the General Services Administration to retain Federal 
facilities in urban areas and to put new ones there.
    2. On August 16, 1978, the President signed Executive Order 12072, 
``Federal Space Management'' which requires the location of Federal 
facilities in such a manner as to

[[Page 115]]

strengthen the Nation's cities, and mandates that in urban areas first 
consideration be given to locating Federal facilities in the central 
business area or adjacent areas of similar character.
    3. The Secretary of Agriculture recognizes the significant role the 
Department can play and the need to assist the Administrator of General 
Services in carrying out the requirements of Executive Order 12072.
    4. The Rural Development Act of 1972, as amended, requires that 
consideration be given to locating Federal facilities in rural areas. 
The new Executive Order on Federal Space Management is consistent with 
the requirements of the Rural Development Act because it concerns the 
location of agencies subsequent to considering the requirements of the 
Act.
    5. It is the policy of the Department of Agriculture to house within 
the same building (colocate) the county level offices of the 
Agricultureal Stabilization and Conservation Service, Cooperative 
Extension Service, Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, Farmers Home 
Administration, and Soil Conservation Service, as well as local offices 
of other Agriculture agencies delivering services at that level. The 
General Services Administration supports this policy.
    6. The Department of Agriculture and the General Services 
Administration agree that:
    a. The program and mission requirements of the agencies of the 
Department permit most of their offices and facilities above the county 
level to function suitably in the central business area of the urban 
areas where they are located. This includes all regional and state 
offices, certain research facilities, and all agencies whose operations 
are not affected in the delivery of services by location.
    b. First consideration will be given to housing county level field 
offices in federally controlled space in the central business area of 
urban areas and incorporated rural communities. However, in cases where 
federally controlled space is available it must be economically 
adaptable to meet Agriculture needs in a timely manner (including the 
total needs for colocated facilities). Otherwise, the primary locational 
consideration shall be the program requirements of the agencies and 
accessibility for their clientele. In such instances, the outskirts of 
the cities and towns are more appropriate for these activities. 
Additionally, central business district locations are often not suitable 
for Forest Service District Ranger offices and other offices with 
special program needs for specific locations, such as plant, grain, 
animal, meat inspectors, and certain research facilities, or cooperative 
functions with state and local governments.
    7. Therefore, this agreement will govern the acquisition of space by 
the General Services Administration for the Department of Agriculture, 
and the Department using its own or delegated leasing authority.
    When a variance from this agreement is requested by either agency it 
shall be the responsibility of the requesting agency to present a 
compelling and fully substantiated case.
    8. The terms ``urban area'' and ``central business area'' are used 
in accordance with the definitions in the Federal Property Management 
Regulations.
    9. This agreement and guidelines shall remain in effect until 
cancelled by one or both parties on ninety days notice.
    10. The parties to this Memorandum of Understanding agree to meet 
and review this agreement for effectiveness after the conclusion of one 
year.

Acting Secretary of Agriculture.

Administrator of General Services.

    Dated: December 29, 1979.

   Guidelines in Support of Memorandum of Understanding Between U.S. 
Department of Agriculture and General Services Administration Concerning 
                   the Location of Federal Facilities

    The Memorandum of Understanding will permit the Department to 
support GSA in implementing Executive Order 12072, particularly the 
requirement to locate Federal facilities in the central business area of 
communities, while at the same time recognizing the location 
requirements of certain special facilities and the county level field 
service offices. This will assist the Department in its colocation 
policy for county level offices and other local offices of Agriculture 
agencies delivering service at that level. The objectives of this policy 
are to:
    Provide better service to clients through one stop access and 
improved office coverage.
    Increase public participation in conservation and stabilization 
through increased exposure to the full range of available programs.
    Disseminate information to more prospective users by directing the 
clients of one agency to the services of another.
    Improve the cooperation of Federal, State, and county program 
administration.
    Achieve administrative economies.
    Enable closer coordination of Agriculture county level programs at 
the delivery point.
    To achieve these goals, the support of GSA is required by treating 
these offices as a single unit in leasing actions when requested by the 
Department.
    Because of the differences in the ways in which the involved 
agencies are required by statute to procure and manage space, 
accommodations in leasing arrangements and

[[Page 116]]

charges are necessary to permit maximum colocation. For example, space 
for Cooperative Extension Service (CES) is provided or funded by the 
county government. In cases where CES cannot locate in Federal space, 
and the Department does not have delegated leasing authority, GSA 
should, consistent with the Federal Procurement Regulations and the 
Federal Property Management Regulations, lease space from or through the 
county in order to permit colocation.
    For similar cases in which Agriculture county offices are working 
through cooperative efforts with State and county counterparts (e.g. 
Conservation Districts, State Forestry Offices, County Planning Boards, 
Representative Committees), and the Department does not have delegated 
leasing authority, GSA should, consistent with the Federal Procurement 
Regulations and the Federal Property Management Regulations, acquire 
space to permit the Agriculture offices to be located with these State 
and local groups.
    Agriculture county level office programs are largely service 
oriented and depend on voluntary public participation for their 
effectiveness in achieving key national objectives of resource 
conservation, economic stabilization, and rural development. It is 
necessary that GSA recognize that location, provision, maintenance, and 
accessibility of county office facilities have a direct and significant 
impact on achieving this mission and must be administered accordingly.
    Consistent with the Rural Development Act of 1972, as amended, the 
new Executive Order on Federal Space Management will not be used as a 
basis for moving Agriculture offices from rural to urban communities.
    All Agriculture regional offices, State offices, and certain 
research facilities, and all agencies whose operations are not affected 
by location will be located in the central business area of the 
community in which they are located whenever such location is consistent 
with program requirements. Exceptions will be considered only on a case-
by-case basis where application of this policy represents clearly 
demonstrable and quantifiable inhibitions to the delivery of program 
services.
    First consideration will be given to housing county level field 
offices in federally controlled space in the central business district 
of the community. Exceptions, in addition to lack of sufficient 
economically adaptable space, must be based on clearly demonstrable 
inadequacies, such as inadequate parking for clientele, prohibition of 
trucks and other commercial vehicles on the streets leading to the 
building, location of the building in a community outside the area being 
served, failure to meet the handicapped requirements, unsafe or 
unhealthful working conditions.

Sec. 101-17.4702  Memorandum of agreement between the General Services Administration and the U.S. Postal Service for implementing the President's urban policy.

   Agreement Between the General Services Administration and the U.S. 
      Postal Service for Implementing the President's Urban Policy

             GSA--USPS Urban Policy Memorandum of Agreement

    Whereas the United States Postal Service, hereafter called USPS, and 
the General Services Administration, hereafter called GSA, share common 
goals and common needs in carrying out their missions and in 
implementing the President's urban policy by locating facilities in 
Central Business Areas (CBA)of Urban Areas (UA), and,
    Whereas for the purpose of this agreement a UA means any Standard 
Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA) as defined by the Department of 
Commerce. An area which is not an SMSA is classified as an urban area if 
it is one of the following: (1) A geographical area within the 
jurisdiction of any incorporated city, town, borough, village or other 
unit of general local government, except county or parish, having a 
population of ten thousand or more inhabitants; (2) that portion of the 
geographical area within the jurisdiction of any county, town, township, 
or similar governmental entity which contains no incorporated unit of 
general local government but has a population density equal to or 
exceeding one thousand five hundred inhabitants per square mile; and (3) 
that portion of any geographical area having a population density equal 
to or exceeding one thousand five hundred inhabitants per square mile 
and situated adjacent to the boundary of any incorporated unit general 
local government which has a population of ten thousand or more 
inhabitants; and CBA means those areas within a central city in an SMSA 
or those areas within any non-SMSA urban area which encompass the 
community's principal business and commercial activities, and the 
immediate fringes thereof, as geographically defined in consultation 
with local officials. A central city means any city whose name appears 
in the title of an SMSA, and
    Whereas GSA and USPS believe that the public welfare can be better 
served by increased cooperation between the two agencies, and,
    Whereas the existing agreement does not cover all areas of agreement 
and cooperation necessary to promote those goals and needs which are 
desirable between the two agencies.
    Now therefore, USPS and GSA agree to the following principles:

[[Page 117]]

    I. In order to better attain the goals of Executive Order 12072, 
Federal Space Management, and the President's Urban Policy, USPS and GSA 
agree to take steps to improve coordination of planning activities for 
new facilities in urban areas, including the following:
    A. In planning to construct a facility in a community, USPS and GSA 
will give preference to locating such facilities in the CBA unless the 
program requirements of the activities to be housed dictate that the 
facility be located elsewhere in the urban area.
    B. As early as possible in the planning of a project to be satisfied 
by new construction in a CBA, the planning agency shall notify the other 
agency of the proposed project. If both USPS and GSA agree that a joint 
project is economically beneficial, then a determination will 
immediately be made as to which agency will be responsible for the 
planning; the basis for this determination will be occupancy in excess 
of 55% of the proposed space, i.e., unless USPS will occupy over 55% of 
the net rentable area, GSA will be the owner agency. Regardless of which 
agency is the owner agency, the tenant agency will guarantee occupancy 
of the space planned for that agency for a minumum period of 10 years, 
unless another period of time is mutually agreed upon by both agencies.
    (1) General Services Administration. (a) Projects requiring 
Congressional approval. Lease construction projects having an annual net 
rent of $500,000 or more or Federal construction and repair and 
alteration projects having a total project cost of $500,000 or more 
require approval of a prospectus or a Report of Building Project Survey 
by the Public Works Committees of the Congress.
    When such a project is in the preparation stage, GSA's regional 
office will notify the appropriate USPS regional office that it is 
contemplating a project in the CBA. If USPS has a long range space 
requirement that could be satisfied in the CBA, it will advise GSA's 
regional office so that space may be included in planning the proposed 
project. When GSA's Central Office submits the prospectus for the 
proposed project to the Office of Management and Budget for approval and 
subsequently to the Public Works committees of the Congress for 
authorization, copies of the prospectus will be funished to the USPS 
Headquarters office and the appropriate USPS regional office. At any 
time during the planning and approval process that USPS determines it 
does not have a requirement for space, the USPS Headquarters office will 
advise the GSA Central Office of this requirement change. Prior to 
commencing with the design of the building, the GSA regional office will 
obtain the final space requirements from the USPS regional office along 
with a firm commitment to occupy the space for a minimum period of 10 
years, or any other time that is mutually agreed upon between the two 
agencies.
    (b) Projects Not Requiring Congressional approval. When GSA plans a 
project not requiring Congressional approval and to be located in the 
CBA, GSA's regional office will notify the appropriate USPS regional 
office. If USPS has a long range space need that could be satisfied in 
the CBA, it will advise GSA's regional office so that space may be 
included in the proposed project. Prior to GSA soliciting offers 
requesting firm proposals to lease the required space, the GSA regional 
office will obtain the final space requirements from the USPS regional 
office along with a firm commitment to occupy the space for a minimum 
period of 10 years or as may be mutually agreed upon between the 
appropriate regional offices of the USPS and GSA.
    (2) United States Postal Service. (a) Within seven days after 
approval of the USPS five year budget plan, the Postal Service will 
provide GSA with a list of approved projects. If GSA wishes to 
participate in any of the planned projects, GSA will advise USPS of its 
interest in participation within 90 days after notification by USPS, 
give an estimate of the amount and type of space required, and will 
commence necessary studies to develop firm space needs.
    When GSA indicates an interest in participation, the USPS region 
which has the responsibility for planning activities shall then 
coordinate space planning activities with the appropriate GSA Region so 
that an adequately sized site is acquired for the facility. Prior to 
commencement of design of the building, GSA shall furnish final space 
requirements to the USPS and a firm commitment to occupy the space for a 
minimum period of ten years or any other term that may be mutually 
agreed upon by both agencies.
    (b) During the USPS planning phase of the project the contact point 
for GSA within the Postal Service will be the Director, Real Estate and 
Buildings Department, for the USPS region responsible for the planning.
    After approval and authorization of funding by the USPS for the 
project, the USPS point of contact shall remain the same, unless the 
project has been determined to be a major USPS facility. In such cases 
the Commissioner, Public Buildings Service at GSA will be notified that 
the new point of contact will be the Assistant Postmaster General, Real 
Estate and Buildings Department, United States Postal Service.
    C. Both agencies recognize that decisions to occupy space are based 
on an expected period of occupany. Delays in the planning, approval, 
funding and start of design phases of a project could alter these 
decisions. It is therefore agreed that both parties will provide an 
expected date that space will be available at the time of initial 
project notifications. Project delays occurring at any

[[Page 118]]

time from initial notification through start of design will be reported 
to the tenant agency and may be cause for cancellation of any commitment 
to occupy space.
    D. When USPS or GSA has control over a site in the UA which is 
needed by the other agency for a project, the agencies agree to make 
such sites available to each other to the maximum extent practicable and 
possible under laws and regulations governing each agency, i.e., one 
agency acquiring a site by transfer from the other through the land bank 
or GSA obtaining an assignable option from USPS for a lease construction 
project.
    II. When GSA or USPS seeks leased space, available space in both 
agencies' inventories shall be considered before any advertisement for 
privately owned space. If the available space is not acceptable to the 
acquiring agency then the acquiring agency shall advise the holding 
agency and allow the holding agency sufficient time to accommodate the 
acquiring agency's objection, provided the mission need of the tenant 
agency will not be adversely affected by the delay. If the space would 
be suitable with alterations which would normally be the responsibility 
of the owner agency, but the owner agency does not have funds to make 
those alterations, then the tenant agency may fund the alterations. In 
such cases, the rent charged the tenant shall be based upon the 
condition of the space prior to the alterations and the space will not 
be subject to preemption by the owner agency for a period of 10 years or 
such other time to which the two agencies shall agree. In any case the 
period shall be not less than three years.
    In the case of renting, the acquiring agency shall guarantee to the 
holding agency continued occupancy of a period sufficient to amortize 
construction costs whenever extensive repairs and remodeling are 
required. Repairs and alterations shall be made in accordance with 
existing agreements.
    III. It is recognized that both agencies have a vested interest in 
conserving energy Therefore, to ensure that both agencies benefit from 
the experience and technology of the other, it is agreed that each 
agency will furnish to the other reports, studies, research, and 
development data in the field of energy conservation once this 
information is accepted by the contracting agency. Additionally, 
internal policies and procedures relating to energy conservation shall 
be exchanged as they are issued.
    IV. Both agencies recognize the National interest in preserving 
historic buildings, each having several hundred designated historic 
properties in its inventory. In order to conserve our Nation's cultural 
heritage it is agreed that as early as possible in the planning process 
each agency will notify the other as to its need to vacate an historic 
building so that the other may give proper consideration to acquiring 
and utilizing such property.
    V. It is recognized by both agencies that improved communications 
between USPS and GSA will benefit not only both agencies, but also all 
Federal agencies, local jurisdictions, and the general welfare. Many of 
the misundertandings result from problems and situations which are not 
covered in the present agreement between the two agencies (dated August 
1974). Therefore, it is agreed that the existing agreement shall be 
amended and approved by both agencies no later than June 30, 1979. It is 
also agreed that the Commissioner of the Public Buildings Service of GSA 
and the Assistant Postmaster General, Real Estate and Buildings 
Department of the United States Postal Service, shall meet annually in 
September to review the continuing working relationship of the agencies. 
Such meetings will commence in September 1979.
    It is also agreed that the terms of the agreement between GSA and 
USPS shall be equally binding on both agencies, internal regulations of 
either agency notwithstanding. In order to maintain continuity and 
coordination with respect to this agreement, there will be a single 
point of contact within each agency for all matters pertaining to the 
relationship between GSA and USPS. That contact shall, in turn, be 
responsible for coordinating within his respective agency. At GSA, the 
point of contact will be the Assistant Commissioner for Space 
Management, Public Buildings Service. At USPS, the point of contact 
shall be the Director, Office of Real Estate. The point of contact for 
exchange of project requirements, as specified by sections I and II of 
this agreement, at the regional level are as follows: the GSA contact 
shall be the Director, Space Management Division, Public Buildings 
Service, and the USPS contact shall be the General Manager, Real Estate 
Division.
    VI. Upon signing this memorandum of cooperation agreement, GSA and 
USPS shall issue appropriate instructions to the field implementing this 
agreement. The agreement will become effective 90 days after it is 
signed to allow each agency time to issue the proper implementing 
instruction.

Administrator.

<R05>
Sec. 101-18.100  Basic policy.

    (a) GSA will lease privately owned land and building space only when 
needs cannot be satisfactorily met in Government-controlled space and:
    (1) Leasing proves to be more advantageous than the construction of 
a new or alteration of an existing Federal building;
    (2) New construction or alteration is not warranted because 
requirements in the community are insufficient or indefinite in scope or 
duration; or
    (3) Completion of a new building within a reasonable time cannot be 
ensured.
    (b) Available space in buildings under the custody and control of 
the United States Postal Service (USPS) will be given priority 
consideration in fulfilling Federal agency space needs.
    (c) Acquisition of space by lease will be on the basis most 
favorable to the Government, with due consideration to maintenance and 
operational efficiency, and only at charges consistent with prevailing 
scales for comparable facilities in the community.
    (d) Acquisition of space by lease will be by negotiation except 
where the sealed bid procedure is required by 41 U.S.C. 253(a). Except 
as otherwise provided in 41 U.S.C. 253, full and open competition will 
be obtained among suitable available locations meeting minimum 
Government requirements.
    (e) When acquiring space by lease, the provisions of Sec. 101-17.205 
regarding determination of the location of Federal facilities shall be 
strictly adhered to.
    (f) When acquiring space by lease, the provisions of section 110(a) 
of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 470), as 
amended, regarding the use of historic properties shall be strictly 
adhered to.


<R05>
Sec. 101-18.101  Acquisition by GSA.

    (a) GSA will perform all functions of leasing building space, and 
land incidental thereto, for Federal agencies except as provided in this 
subpart.
    (b) Officials or employees of agencies for which GSA will acquire 
leased space shall at no time, before or after a space request is 
submitted to GSA or after a lease agreement is made, directly or 
indirectly contact lessors, offerors, or potential offerors for the 
purpose of making oral or written representation or commitments or 
agreements with respect to the terms of occupancy of particular space, 
tenant improvements, alterations and repairs, or payment for overtime 
services, unless

[[Page 121]]

authorized by the Director of the Real Estate Division in the 
responsible GSA regional office or facility support center.


<R05>
Sec. 101-18.102  Acquisition by other agencies.

    (a) Acquisitions of leased space by agencies possessing independent 
statutory authority to acquire such space are not subject to GSA 
approval or authority.
    (b) Upon request, GSA will perform, on a reimbursable basis, all 
functions of leasing building space, and land incidental thereto, for 
Federal agencies possessing independent leasing authority.
    (c) GSA reserves the right to accept or reject reimbursable leasing 
service requests on a case-by-case basis.


<R05>
Sec. 101-18.103  Agency cooperation.

    The heads of executive agencies shall:
    (a) Cooperate with and assist the Administrator of General Services 
in carrying out his responsibilities respecting office buildings and 
space;
    (b) Take measures to give GSA early notice of new or changing space 
requirements;
    (c) Seek to economize their requirements for space; and
    (d) Continuously review their needs for space in and near the 
District of Columbia, taking into account the feasibility of 
decentralizing services or activities which can be carried on elsewhere 
without excessive costs or significant loss of efficiency.


<R05>
Sec. 101-18.104  Delegation of leasing authority.

    (a) Agencies are authorized to perform for themselves all functions 
with respect to the acquisition of leased space in buildings and land 
incidental thereto when the following conditions are met:
    (1) The space may be leased for no rental, or for a nominal 
consideration of $1.00 per annum, and shall be limited to terms not to 
exceed one (1) year;
    (2) Authority has been requested by an executive agency and a 
specific delegation has been granted by the Administrator of General 
Services;
    (3) A categorical delegation has been granted by the Administrator 
of General Services for space to accommodate particular types of agency 
activities, such as military recruiting offices or space for certain 
county level agricultural activities. A listing of categorical 
delegations is found at Sec. 101-18.104-2; or
    (4) The required space is found by the Administrator of General 
Services to be wholly or predominantly utilized for the special purposes 
of the agency to occupy such space and is not generally suitable for use 
by other agencies. Prior approval of GSA shall be obtained before an 
agency initiates a leasing action involving 2,500 or more square feet of 
such special purpose space. The request for approval and a Standard Form 
81 shall be filed with the GSA regional office having jurisdiction in 
the area of the proposed leasing action as shown in Sec. 101-17.4801. 
GSA's approval shall be based upon a finding that there is no vacant 
Government-owned or leased space available that will meet the agency's 
requirements.
    A listing of agency special purpose space delegations is found at 
Sec. 101-18.104-3.
    (b) The Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, and Defense may lease 
their own building space, and land incidental to its use, and provide 
for its operation, maintenance, and custody when the space is situated 
outside an urban center. Such leases shall be for terms not to exceed 
five (5) years. A list of urban centers follows.

<R05>
Sec. 101-18.105  Contingent fees and related procedure.

    The provisions of subpart 3.4 of Title 48 with respect to contingent 
fees and related procedure are hereby made applicable to all negotiated 
and sealed bid contracts for the acquisition of real property by lease. 
The representations and covenants required by that subpart shall be 
appropriately adapted for use in leases of real property for Government 
use.


<R05>
Sec. 101-18.106  Application of socioeconomic considerations.

    (a) In acquiring space by lease, agencies will avoid locations which 
will work a hardship on employees because (1) there is a lack of 
adequate low- and moderate-income nondiscriminatory housing for 
employees within reasonable proximity to the location, and (2) the 
location is not readily accessible from other areas of the community.
    (b) Consideration of low- and moderate-income nondiscriminatory 
housing for employees and the need for development and redevelopment of 
areas for socioeconomic improvement will apply to the acquisition of 
space by lease where:
    (1) 100 or more low- or moderate-income employees are expected to be 
employed in the space to be leased; and
    (2) The proposed leasing action involves residential relocation of a 
majority of the existing low- and moderate-income work force, a 
significant increase in their transportation or parking costs, travel 
time that exceeds 45 minutes to the new location, or a 20 percent 
increase in travel time if travel time to the present facility already 
exceeds an average of 45 minutes; or
    (3) GSA requests Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) 
review in lease actions of special importance not covered by paragraphs 
(b) (1) and (2) of this section.
    (c) HUD, as the agency responsible for providing information 
concerning the availability of nondiscriminatory low- and moderate-
income housing in areas where Federal facilities are to be located, 
shall be consulted when such information is required.
    (d) Other socioeconomic considerations described in Sec. 101-19.101 
are also applicable to lease acquisitions.

[[Page 131]]


<R04>
        Subpart 101-18.2--Acquisition by Purchase or Condemnation


<R05>
Sec. 101-18.200  Purpose.

    These regulations will:
    (a) Encourage and expedite the acquisition of real property by 
agreements with owners;
    (b) Avoid litigation where possible and relieve congestion in the 
courts;
    (c) Insure consistent treatment of owners in the many Federal 
programs; and
    (d) Promote public confidence in Federal land acquisition practices.


<R05>
Sec. 101-18.201  Basic acquisition policy.

    GSA, to the greatest extent practicable, will:
    (a) Make every reasonable effort to acquire expeditiously real 
property by negotiation.
    (b) Appraise real property before the initiation of negotiations and 
give the owner or his designated representative an opportunity to 
accompany the appraiser during his inspection of the property.
    (c) Establish, prior to the initiation of negotiations for real 
property, an amount estimated to be the just compensation therefor and 
make a prompt offer to acquire the property for the full amount so 
established. GSA will provide the owner of the real property to be 
acquired with a written statement of the amount established as just 
compensation and a summary of the basis for it. Where appropriate, the 
just compensation for the real properly acquired and for damages to 
remaining real property will be separately stated. The summary statement 
to be furnished the owner will include the following:
    (1) Identification of the real property and the estate or interest 
therein to be acquired;
    (2) Identification of the buildings, structures, and other 
improvements considered to be part of the real property for which the 
offer of just compensation is made;
    (3) A statement that GSA's determination of just compensation is 
based on the estimated fair market value of the property to be acquired. 
If only part of the property is to be acquired or the interest to be 
acquired is less than the full interest of the owner, the statement will 
explain the basis for the determination of the just compensation;
    (4) A statement that GSA's determination of just compensation is not 
less than its approved appraisal of the property; and
    (5) A statement that any increase or decrease in the fair market 
value of the real property, prior to the date of valuation, caused by 
the public improvement or project for which the real property is to be 
acquired, or by the likelihood that the real property would be acquired 
for such improvement or project, other than that due to physical 
deterioration within the reasonable control of the owner, has been 
disregarded in making the determination of just compensation for the 
property.
    (d) Acquire at least an equal interest in all buildings, structures, 
or other improvements located upon the real property. This includes 
buildings, structures, or other improvements that GSA requires to be 
removed from the real property or that GSA determines will affect 
adversely the proposed use of the real property. If any buildings, 
structures, or other improvements comprising part of the real property 
are the property of an occupant who has the right or obligation to 
remove them at the expiration of his term, the total just compensation 
for the real property, including the property of the occupant, will be 
determined and the occupant will be paid the greater of the:
    (1) Fair market value of the buildings, structures, or other 
improvements to be removed from the property; or
    (2) Contributive fair market value of the occupant's improvements to 
the fair market value of the entirety, which value should not be less 
than the value of his improvements for removal from the real property. 
Payment under this paragraph (d) of this section will not be a 
duplication of any payment otherwise authorized by law. No payment will 
be made unless the landowner disclaims all interests in the occupant's 
improvements and the occupant in consideration for such payment shall 
assign, transfer, and release to the Government all his right, title, 
and

[[Page 132]]

interest in and to such improvements. The occupant may reject payment 
under this paragraph (d) of this section and obtain payment for his 
property interests in accordance with other applicable laws.
    (e) Obtain only one appraisal on each parcel, tract, etc., of real 
property to be acquired unless GSA determines that circumstances require 
an additional appraisal or appraisals.
    (f) Maintain records to verify that the landowner or his designated 
representative(s) was given an opportunity to accompany the appraiser 
during the inspection of the real property.
    (g) Pay an owner or occupant or deposit such payment in the registry 
of the court before requiring him to surrender his property. To the 
maximum extent practicable, owners and occupants will be given at least 
90 days' notice of displacement before being required to move from real 
property acquired by GSA. If permitted by GSA to remain in possession 
for a short period of time after Government acquisition, the rental 
charged for this occupancy will not be more than the fair rental value 
of the property to a short-term occupier.
    (h) Not intentionally make it necessary for an owner to institute 
legal proceedings to prove the fact of the taking of his property. Offer 
to acquire the entire property where the acquisition of a part of a 
property will leave the owner with an uneconomic remnant.


<R05>
Sec. 101-18.202  Expenses incidental to transfer.

    GSA will amend its contract-to-sell-real-property forms to provide 
for reimbursement to vendors in amounts deemed by GSA to be fair and 
reasonable for the following expenses:
    (a) Recording fees, transfer taxes (other than tax imposed on the 
United States), and similar expenses incidental to conveying the real 
property;
    (b) Penalty cost for prepayment of any preexisting recorded mortgage 
entered into in good faith encumbering said real property; and
    (c) The pro rata portion of real property taxes paid by the vendor 
for periods subsequent to the day title vests in the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 101-18.203  Litigation expenses.

    GSA will plan for and take into consideration the possible liability 
for the payment of litigation expenses of a condemnee as provided for in 
section 304 of the Act.

    (a) In the process of developing building projects, the policies 
contained in Sec. 101-17.002 regarding the determination of the location 
of Federal facilities shall be strictly adhered to.
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) To the maximum extent practical, GSA will plan the construction 
and alteration of Federal facilities when such action can be shown to 
the most prudent and economic means of meeting Federal space 
requirements.
    (d) GSA will provide technical services and guidance to other 
Federal agencies in the formulation and development of their programs 
for construction and alteration of special facilities.
    (e) Excess properties transferred to GSA will be renovated and 
altered whenever practical to meet Government space needs.
    (f) In selecting sites for public buildings, consideration will also 
be given to:
    (1) Maximum utilization of Government-owned land (including excess 
land) whenever it is adequate, economically adaptable to requirements 
and properly located, where such use is consistent with the provisions 
of Executive Order 11724 of June 25, 1973 (38 FR 16837), and subpart 
101-47.8;
    (2) A site adjacent to or in the proximity of an existing Federal 
building which is well located and is to be retained for long-term 
occupancy; and
    (3) Suitable sites in established civic or redevelopment centers 
which are well planned and properly financed

[[Page 134]]

with development initiated and insured.
    (g) The design of new buildings and their appurtenances should 
provide efficient and economical facilities in an architecture of 
distinction and quality. The architecture should reflect the dignity, 
enterprise, vigor, and stability of the United States Government. The 
designs shall embody the finest contemporary American architectural 
thought and shall respect local architectural characteristics.
    (h) In the alteration of existing buildings, GSA will maintain 
architectural integrity and compatibility with existing structures.
    (i) In the design of new public buildings, and to the extent 
feasible in the alteration of existing public buildings, GSA will (1) 
insure that such buildings and attendant facilities will be accessible 
to and usable by the physically handicapped (42 U.S.C. 4151-4156) and 
(2) utilize, to the maximum extent, modern methods and techniques for 
the control of air and water pollution (Clean Air Act 42 U.S.C. 1857-
1858; Federal Water Pollution Control Act, 33 U.S.C. 1151-1175).
    (j) In the siting and locating of buildings on selected sites, GSA 
representatives will work directly with local officials in seeking to 
conform as closely as possible to local zoning regulations.
    (k) In the design of new public buildings and alterations to public 
buildings, the objectives of nationally recognized building and 
performance codes, standards, and specifications will be met and 
amplified according to the needs of GSA and as necessary to conform with 
the accident and fire prevention policy objectives stated in Sec. 101-
20.109-1. In addition, special features of local codes directly related 
to local circumstances or practices will be, to the maximum extent 
practical, incorporated into the design.
    (l) Parking for Government-owned, visitors', and employees' vehicles 
will be provided in the planning of public buildings with due regard to 
the needs of the Federal agencies to be housed in each building, local 
zoning and parking regulations, availability of public transportation, 
and availability of planned and existing public and privately owned 
parking facilities in the locality.
    (m) Fine arts, as appropriate, will be incorporated in the design of 
selected new public buildings. Fine arts, including painting, sculpture, 
and artistic work in other mediums, will reflect the national cultural 
heritage and emphasize the work of living American artists.
    (n) Security floodlighting, as appropriate, will be incorporated in 
the design of selected new public buildings. Such security floodlighting 
will be designed for minimum energy consumption and reflect and enhance 
the architectural esthetics of the building.

<R05>
Sec. 101-19.100  Intergovernmental consultation on Federal projects.

    (a) As used in this section, the following terms will have the 
meanings defined herein:
    (1) Planning agencies. Planning agencies are defined as the Governor 
of a State or, if there is one, the appropriate A-95 clearinghouse of 
the State, region, or metropolitan area, and the appropriate local, 
county, metropolitan, regional, and State planning and environmental 
authorities.
    (2) Federal projects. Federal projects are defined as public 
buildings construction projects and lease construction projects required 
to be authorized in accordance with, or in the manner provided by, the 
provisions of the Public Buildings Act of 1959, as amended; and projects 
involving a significant change in the use of federally owned property or 
property to be acquired by exchange in connection with a public 
buildings project authorized under the provisions of the Public 
Buildings Act of 1959, as amended, or the Federal Property and 
Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended.
    (b) GSA will consult with planning agencies, local elected 
officials, and appropriate Federal agencies to coordinate Federal 
projects with development plans and programs of the State, region, and 
locality in which the project is to be located to ensure that all 
national, regional, State, and local viewpoints are fully considered and 
taken into account to the extent possible in planning Federal projects. 
A written statement containing a clear justification for Federal actions 
that are inconsistent with local plans will be provided the appropriate 
planning agencies.
    (c) The consultation and coordination pursuant to paragraph (b) of 
this section will be initiated by the GSA Regional Administrator of the 
region in which the Federal project is located, and the manner in which 
the consultation and coordination will be effected is set forth below:
    (1) The GSA Regional Administrator will notify the planning agencies 
at least 30 calendar days before the initiation of any survey conducted 
for the purpose of preparing a prospectus or Report of Building Project 
Survey for submittal to the Congress. Notifications of less than 30 
calendar days are authorized only in emergency situations. The 
notification will specify the approximate date(s) on which the survey 
will be conducted and will request that the GSA Regional Administrator 
be provided as soon as practicable all pertinent planning and 
development information that will be considered in connection with the 
space plan for the community. This information will include city, 
county, State, and regional plans for land use and development; use of 
community development funds; neighborhood revitalization; mass transit; 
highways; flood control; and air, water, solid waste, and other relevant 
environmental data.
    (2) Within 30 calendar days following the approval of a proposed 
action by the Congress, the GSA Regional Administrator will inform the 
previously notified planning agencies of the results of the survey. 
Particular reference will be made to the need, if any, for a new Federal 
building within a 10-year period or a major lease consolidation which 
could result in new commercial construction in the community. The letter 
will request that the GSA Regional Administrator be informed of all 
changes or refinements in the planning information initially provided, 
and set forth the following minimum data relative to the proposed 
Federal project:
    (i) Area or city in which the project will be located;
    (ii) Type of building (office building, post office, courthouse, 
etc.);
    (iii) Approximate size of building;
    (iv) Specific site location requirements;
    (v) Estimated building population; and
    (vi) Estimated total project cost.
    (3) In addition to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, major project 
designs should be made available to planning agencies at the conceptual 
design stage, and information received by GSA 2 or more years prior to 
commencement of action on a project shall be verified.
    (4) When GSA is to conduct a site investigation, propose a 
significant

[[Page 137]]

change in the use of federally owned or leased property that may require 
a complete environmental assessment resulting in a negative declaration 
or an environmental impact statement, propose the renovation or 
extension of an existing federally owned building required to be 
authorized in accordance with the provisions of the Public Buildings Act 
of 1959, as amended, acquire property by exchange in connection with the 
construction of a public building, or issue a Solicitation for Offers in 
connection with a lease construction project as described in paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section, the GSA Regional Administrator will notify the 
planning agencies and the principal elected official(s) of the community 
where the proposed action will take place not less than 30 calendar days 
in advance of the initiation of such action. Only verbal notification of 
planning agencies is required if the site investigation is conducted 
within 1 year of an announcement under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. 
The organizations and officials so notified will have the 30-day notice 
period in which to consult with the GSA Regional Administrator and 
provide him with data and comments pertinent to the proposed action. 
Notifications of less than 30 calendar days are authorized only in 
emergency situations.
    (5) When GSA takes action pursuant to Sec. 101-47.203-7 of this 
chapter for the transfer of federally owned real property for a direct 
project requirement which involves a substantial change in the character 
of its use, the views of the planning agencies and the principal elected 
official(s) will be obtained and considered by the GSA Regional 
Administrator, and these views will be included on GSA Form 1334, 
Request for Transfer of Excess Real Property and Related Personal 
Property.
    (6) When property is transferred for exchange purposes, the views of 
the planning agencies and the principal elected official(s) will be 
considered prior to consummation of the exchange.
    (d) The provisions of paragraph (c) of this section shall not be 
applied when the Administrator of General Services deems that the 
application thereof would adversely affect the best interest of the 
Government.
    (e) If GSA has determined that any Federal project under its 
jurisdiction may significantly affect the quality of the human 
environment, prior to a final decision concerning that project GSA will 
provide Federal agencies having jurisdiction by law or special expertise 
with respect to any environmental impact involved, planning agencies 
which are authorized to develop and enforce environmental standards, and 
others as appropriate with an adequate opportunity to review such 
projects pursuant to section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental 
Policy Act of 1969 and the regulations of the Council on Environmental 
Quality (CEQ).
    (f) The Federal agencies, planning agencies, and others referred to 
in paragraph (e) of this Sec. 101-19.100 will be notified as follows 
concerning Federal projects under GSA jurisdiction that are determined 
to have a significant effect on the human environment:
    (1) GSA will transmit copies of the draft environmental statement, 
prepared in accordance with the provisions of National Environmental 
Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and the regulations of the Council on 
Environmental Quality to the Environmental Protection Agency, and to the 
Governor of the State, the U.S. Senators of the State, and the U.S. 
Representative from the congressional district of the State where the 
project will be located.
    (2) Thereafter, GSA will submit copies of the draft environmental 
statement to the appropriate city mayor and to the Federal, State, and 
local planning agencies for comment. The allowable period for comment 
shall be 45 calendar days. If requests for extension are made a maximum 
period of 15 calendar days may be granted.
    (3) Comments received from the Federal agencies, planning agencies, 
and others will be reconciled through coordination with the Federal and 
State agencies concerned. The environmental statement may be revised to 
reflect the additional data and comments obtained. A discussion of 
problems and objections by Federal agencies and State and local entities 
in the review process and the recommended disposition of the issues 
involved will be included in the final text of the environmental 
statement.

[[Page 138]]

    (4) Copies of the final environmental statement will be transmitted 
to the Environmental Protection Agency and to those persons who 
submitted substantive comments on the draft statement or requested 
copies of the final statement. Unless waived by EPA, no irreversible or 
irretrievable action shall be taken on a project until 30 calendar days 
after submission of the final statement to EPA.
    (g) Through the appropriate planning agencies, Health System 
Agencies and State Health Planning and Development Agencies authorized 
to perform comprehensive health planning, pursuant to the National 
Health Planning and Resources Development Act of 1974, shall be provided 
adequate opportunity to review Federal projects for construction and/or 
equipment involving capital expenditures exceeding $200,000 for 
modernization, conversion, and expansion of Federal inpatient care 
facilities that alter the bed capacity or modify the primary function of 
the facility, as well as plans for provision of major new medical 
services. Projects to renovate or install mechanical systems, air-
conditioning systems, or other similar internal system modifications are 
excluded. The comments of such agencies or a certification that the 
agencies were provided a reasonable time to comment and failed to do so 
shall accompany the plan and budget requests submitted by the Federal 
agency to the Office of Management and Budget.
    (h) Planning agencies should advise GSA of projects which may 
present potential areas of joint cooperation by contacting the PBS 
Regional Commissioner for the region in which the project is located.

Sec. 101-19.101  Application of socioeconomic considerations.

    This section provides an effective systematic arrangement to insure 
the availability of low- and moderate-income housing for Federal 
employees without discrimination because of race, color, religion, or 
national origin and to influence the improvement in social and economic 
conditions in the area of Federal buildings.


<R05>
Sec. 101-19.101-1  Location of buildings.

    (a) GSA, in all its determinations regarding the location of 
federally constructed buildings and the acquisition of leased buildings, 
will consider to the maximum possible extent the availability of low- 
and moderate-income housing for employees without discrimination because 
of race, color, religion, or national origin and will affirmatively 
further the purposes of title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968.
    (b) Final decisions of the Administrator of General Services will be 
based on the determination that such decisions will improve the 
management and administration of governmental activities and services 
and will foster the programs and policies of the Federal Government.


<R05>
Sec. 101-19.101-2  Agreement with Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.

    (a) The Administrator of General Services has entered into an 
agreement with the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to utilize 
the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to investigate, 
determine, and report to GSA findings on the availability of low- and 
moderate-income housing on a nondiscriminatory basis with respect to 
proposed locations for a federally constructed building or major lease 
action having a significant socioeconomic impact on a community.
    (b) HUD shall advise GSA and other Federal agencies with respect to 
actions which would increase the availability of low- and moderate-
income housing on a nondiscriminatory basis, after a site has been 
selected for a federally constructed building or a lease executed for 
space and shall assist in increasing the availability of such housing 
through its own programs.
    (c) The text of the HUD-GSA agreement is located at Sec. 101-
19.4801.

[[Page 139]]


<R05>
Sec. 101-19.101-3  Consultation with HUD.

    (a) In the initial selection of a city or delineation of a general 
area for location of public buildings or leased buildings, GSA will 
provide the earliest possible notice to HUD of information with respect 
to such decisions. Regional offices of HUD, as identified by the 
Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and local planning and 
housing authorities will be consulted concerning the present and planned 
availability of low- and moderate-income housing on a nondiscriminatory 
basis in the area where the project is to be located during the project 
development investigation.
    (b) Regional office representatives of HUD, as designated by the 
Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, will participate in site 
investigations for the purpose of providing a report to GSA on the 
availability of low- and moderate-income housing on a nondiscriminatory 
basis in the area of the investigation.
    (c) The HUD Regional Administrator will transmit to the Regional 
Commissioner, PBS, his evaluation of the sites being considered. In any 
case in which a proposed site is deemed inadequate on one or more 
grounds; i.e., supply of low- and moderate-income housing on a non-
discriminatory basis, nondiscrimination in the sale and rental of 
housing on the basis of race, color, religion, or national origin, or 
availability of transportation from housing to site, the HUD Regional 
Administrator shall include an outline of corrective actions which, in 
his judgment, will be required to overcome the inadequacies noted.
    (d) The following actions are subject to the provisions of the HUD/
GSA Memorandum of Understanding:
    (1) All project development investigations.
    (2) Site selections for public buildings (or leased space in 
buildings to be erected by the lessor) in which 100 or more low- and 
moderate-income employees are expected to be employed in the new 
building.
    (3) GSA requests HUD review in actions of special importance not 
covered by paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
    (e) The Regional Commissioner, PBS, shall promptly notify the HUD 
Regional Administrator after reaching a decision on the sites to be 
recommended for a facility and their priority. In the event any of the 
preferred sites are identified by HUD as inadequate on one or more of 
the grounds set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, the HUD Regional 
Administrator shall so advise the Assistant Secretary for Equal 
Opportunity. The Assistant Secretary will notify the Commissioner, 
Public Buildings Service, GSA, of HUD's concerns within 5 workdays after 
notification by the HUD Regional Administrator and agree on the time 
required to properly present HUD's view.
    (f) GSA will provide a written explanation when, after headquarters' 
review, a location is selected which HUD reported inadequate with 
respect to one or more of the grounds set forth in paragraph (c) of this 
section, in accordance with the HUD-GSA Memorandum of Understanding.


<R05>
Sec. 101-19.101-4  Affirmative action plan.

    (a) Prior to the announcement of a site selected contrary to the 
recommendation of HUD, the involved Federal agency, GSA, HUD, and the 
community in which the proposed site is located will utilize the items 
indicated in the report of the HUD Regional Administrator as a basis for 
developing a written Affirmative Action Plan. The Affirmative Action 
Plan will insure that an adequate supply of low- and moderate-income 
housing will be available on a nondiscriminatory basis, and that there 
is adequate transportation from housing to the site before the building 
or space is to be occupied or within a period of 6 months thereafter. 
Such a plan will also contain appropriate provisions designed 
affirmatively to further nondiscrimination in the sale and rental of 
housing on the basis of race, color, religion, or national origin. The 
Affirmative Action Plan will be prepared in accordance with section 9(g) 
of the HUD-GSA Memorandum of Understanding, and will include the 
following points:
    (1) The corrective actions specified by HUD under Sec. 101-19.101-
3(c).
    (2) Assurance of the relocating agency that, when the old and new 
facilities are within the same metropolitan area,

[[Page 140]]

transportation will be provided for their low- and moderate-income 
employees between the old facility or other suitable location and the 
new facility at the beginning and end of the scheduled workday until 
sufficient new housing is built accessible to the new facility, as 
provided in the affirmative action plan.
    (3) All agreements which constitute an Affirmative Action Plan will 
be set forth in writing and will be signed by the appropriate 
representatives of HUD, GSA, the Federal agency involved, community 
bodies and agencies, and other interests whose cooperation and/or 
participation will be necessary to fulfill the requirements of the plan.
    (b) The contents of the Affirmative Action Plan will be made public 
after the site selection decision has been made by GSA.
    (c) The HUD Regional Administrator shall be responsible for 
monitoring compliance with the written Affirmative Action Plan. In the 
event of noncompliance, HUD and GSA shall undertake appropriate action 
to secure compliance. The plan should provide for commitments from the 
community involved to initiate and carry out all feasible efforts to 
obtain a sufficient quantity of low- and moderate-income housing 
available to the agency's personnel on a nondiscriminatory basis with 
adequate access to the location of the building or space. It should 
include commitments by the local officials having the authority to 
remove obstacles to the provisions of such housing when such obstacles 
exist and to take effective steps to insure its provision. The plan 
should also set forth the steps proposed by the agency to develop and 
implement a counseling and referral service to seek out and assist 
personnel to obtain such housing. As part of any plan, during as well as 
after its development, HUD will give priority consideration to 
applications for assistance under its housing programs for the housing 
proposed to be provided in accordance with the plan.


<R05>
Sec. 101-19.101-5  Agency compliance.

    (a) Agencies shall cooperate with the Administrator of General 
Services and provide such information as may be necessary effectively to 
comply with these regulations and to cooperate with the Secretary of 
Housing and Urban Development affirmatively to further the purposes of 
title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3601).
    (b) As a minimum, agencies shall determine the number of positions 
by grade and an estimate of the number of employees whose jobs are being 
moved. Further details, such as family income and size, minority status, 
present home location, and status as head-of-household, may also be 
required depending upon the type, scope, and circumstances of the 
relocation. GSA will inform agencies concerning specific situations.
    (c) Federal agencies who will relocate shall provide counseling and 
referral service to assist their personnel in obtaining housing. GSA and 
HUD will cooperate in this effort.

<R05>
Sec. 101-19.603  Standards.

    Except as provided in Sec. 101-19.604, every building must be 
designed, constructed, or altered to meet the minimum requirements of 
the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (uniform standards) 
developed by the General Services Administration (GSA), the Department 
of Defense (DOD), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), 
and the United States Postal Service (USPS), in consultation with the 
Department of Health and Human Services. Departing from these standards 
by using other methods is permitted if it is clear that equal 
accessibility and usability of the facility are provided. Except as 
provided under Secs. 101-19.602 and 101-19.604, buildings designed, 
constructed, or altered before the effective date of this standard must 
meet the minimum standards in the GSA Accessibility Standard DG6 from 
October 14, 1980, to July 31, 1984, or the American Standard 
Specifications for Making Buildings and Facilities Accessible to and 
Usable by, the Physically Handicapped, published by the American 
National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI A117.1-1961) (R1971) from 
September 2, 1969, to October 13, 1980. Buildings under design are 
governed by the criteria of the uniform standards if the date bids were 
invited falls after the effective date of this rule.
[49 FR 31625, Aug. 7, 1984]


<R05>
Sec. 101-19.604  Exceptions.

    The standards established in Sec. 101-19.603 shall not apply to:
    (a) The design, construction, alteration, or lease of any portion of 
a building which need not, because of its intended use, be made 
accessible to, or usable by, the public or by physically handicapped 
persons;
    (b) The alteration of an existing building if the alteration does 
not involve the installation of, or work on, existing stairs, doors, 
elevators, toilets, entrances, drinking fountains, floors, telephone 
locations, curbs, parking areas, or any other facilities susceptible of 
installation or improvements to accommodate the physically handicapped;
    (c) The alteration of an existing building, or of portions thereof, 
to which application of the standards is not structurally possible;
    (d) The construction or alteration of a building for which plans and 
specifications were completed or substantially completed on or before 
September 2, 1969: Provided, however, That any building defined in 
Sec. 101-19.602(a)(4) shall be designed, constructed, or altered in 
accordance with the standards prescribed in Sec. 101-19.603 regardless 
of design status or bid solicitation as of September 2, 1969; and
    (e) The leasing of space when it is found after receiving bids or 
offers not otherwise legally acceptable that a proposal meets most of 
the requirements of the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards. If no 
offeror or bidder meets all the requirements, then preference must be 
given to the offeror or bidder who most nearly meets the standards in 
section 101-19.603. If the award is proposed for a firm other than the 
one that most nearly meets the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards 
and whose bid or offer is reasonable in price and is otherwise legally 
acceptable, a waiver or modification of the standards must be obtained.

[39 FR 23214, June 27, 1974, as amended at 43 FR 16479, Apr. 19, 1978; 
49 FR 31625, Aug. 7, 1984]


<R05>
Sec. 101-19.605  Waiver or modification of standards.

    The applicability of the standards set forth in this subpart may be 
modified or waived on a case-by-case basis upon application to GSA by 
the head of the

[[Page 144]]

department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States concerned 
only if the Administrator of General Services determines that such 
waiver of modification is clearly necessary.


<R05>
Sec. 101-19.606  Recordkeeping.

    The administering agency's file on each contract or grant for the 
design, construction, lease, or alteration of a building as defined in 
Sec. 101-19.602 shall be documented with a statement either:
    (a) That the standards are applicable to and have been or will be 
incorporated in the design, the construction, or the alteration, (b) 
that the grant has been or will be made subject to a requirement that 
the standards will be incorporated in the design, the construction, or 
the alteration; (c) that the standards have been waived by the 
Administrator of General Services (in which event the justification for 
the waiver shall be stated); (d) that the project is within one of the 
exceptions set out in Sec. 101-19.604 (the specific exception shall be 
identified and justified); or (e) such other statements as may be 
appropriate with respect to application of the standards to the contract 
or grant. The head of each agency shall be responsible for implementing 
the file documentation requirement by regulation or other appropriate 
means. The documentation shall be made available to the Administrator of 
General Services upon request.

(Sec. 205(c), 63 Stat. 390; 40 U.S.C. 486(c))

[43 FR 16480, Apr. 19, 1978]


<R05>
Sec. 101-19.607  Reporting.

    (a) Annually each administering agency shall prepare and submit to 
the Administrator of General Services reports covering all projects 
subject to the requirements of this subpart 101-19.6 for which funds 
have been appropriated or for which a contract, grant, or loan has been 
approved (whichever is applicable) and which are still under design or 
construction, or buildings for which lease contracts have been awarded. 
Once a project has been reported as being occupied, it need not be 
included in subsequent reports. Lease projects need to be reported only 
during the period in which the award was made. All reports should be 
prepared on GSA Form 2974, Status Report for Federally Funded or Leased 
Buildings--Accommodation of Physically Handicapped. Interagency reports 
control number 0031-GSA-AN has been assigned to this report.
    (b) The annual reporting period, for purposes of this requirement, 
ends on the last day of August. Reports will be due on the fifteenth 
calendar day of the following month. The initial report will cover 
facilities subject to this reporting requirement during the period from 
September 1, 1981, through August 31, 1982.
    (c) Reports will be used for surveys and investigations to ensure 
compliance with The Architectural Barriers Act, as amended, pursuant to 
the requirements of the act.

Sec. 101-19.4800  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart 101-19.48 illustrates information referred to in the 
text of part 101-19 but not suitable for inclusion elsewhere in that 
part.


<R05>
Sec. 101-19.4801  Memorandum of understanding between the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the General Services Administration concerning low- 
          and moderate-income housing.

Memorandum of Understanding Between the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development and the General Services Administration Concerning Low- and 
                         Moderate-Income Housing

    Purpose. The purpose of the memorandum of understanding is to 
provide an effective, systematic arrangement under which the Federal 
Government, acting through HUD and GSA, will fulfill its 
responsibilities under law, and as a major employer, in accordance with 
the concepts of good management, to assure for its employees the 
availability of low- and moderate-income housing without discrimination 
because of race, color, religion, or national origin, and to consider 
the need for development and redevelopment of areas and the development 
of new communities and the impact on improving social and economic 
conditions in the area, whenever Federal Government facilities locate or 
relocate at new sites, and to use its resources and authority to aid in 
the achievement of these objectives.
    1. Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3601) 
states, in section 801, that ``It is the policy of the United States to 
provide, within constitutional limitations, for fair housing throughout 
the United States.'' Section 808(a) places the authority and 
responsibility for administering the Act in the Secretary of Housing and 
Urban Development. Section 808(d) requires all executive departments and 
agencies to administer their programs and activities relating to housing 
and urban development in a manner affirmatively to further the purposes 
of title VIII (fair housing) and to cooperate with the Secretary to 
further such purposes. Section 808(e)(5) provides that the Secretary of 
HUD shall administer the programs and activities relating to housing and 
urban development in a manner affirmatively to further the policies of 
title VIII.
    2. Section 2 of the Housing Act of 1949 (42 U.S.C. 1441) declares 
the national policy of ``* * * the realization as soon as feasible of 
the goal of a decent home and a suitable living environment for every 
American family * * *.'' This goal was reaffirmed in the Housing and 
Urban Development Act of 1968 (sections 2 and 1601; 12 U.S.C. 1701t and 
42 U.S.C. 1441a).
    3. By virtue of the Public Buildings Act of 1959, as amended; the 
Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended; 
and Reorganization Plan No. 18 of 1950, the Administrator of General 
Services is given certain authority and responsibility in connection 
with planning, developing, and constructing Government-owned public 
buildings for housing Federal agencies, and for acquiring leased space 
for Federal agency use.
    4. Executive Order 11512, February 27, 1970, sets forth the policies 
by which the Administrator of General Services and the heads of 
executive agencies will be guided in the acquisition of both federally 
owned and leased office buildings and space.
    5. While Executive Order No. 11512 provides that material 
consideration will be given to the efficient performance of the missions 
and programs of the executive agencies and the nature and functions of 
the facilities involved, there are six other guidelines set forth, 
including:
    The need for development and redevelopment of areas and the 
development of new communities, and the impact a selection will have on 
improving social and economic conditions in the area; and
    The availability of adequate low- and moderate-income housing, 
adequate access from other areas of the urban center, and adequacy of 
parking.
    6. General Services Administration (GSA) recognizes its 
responsibility, in all its determinations with respect to the 
construction of Federal buildings and the acquisition of leased space, 
to consider to the maximum possible extent the availability of low- and 
moderate-income housing without discrimination because of race, color, 
religion, or national origin, in accordance with its duty affirmatively 
to further the purposes of title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 
and with the authorities referred to in paragraph 2 above, and the 
guidelines referred to in paragraph 5 above, and consistent with the 
authorities cited in paragraphs 3 and 4 above. In connection with the 
foregoing statement, it is recognized that all the guidelines must be 
considered in each case, with the ultimate decision to be made by the 
Administrator of General Services upon his determination that such 
decision will improve the management and administration of governmental 
activities and services, and will foster the programs and policies of 
the Federal Government.
    7. In addition to its fair housing responsibilities, the 
responsibilities of HUD include

[[Page 234]]

assisting in the development of the Nation's housing supply through 
programs of mortgage insurance, home ownership and rental housing 
assistance, rent supplements, below market interest rates, and low-rent 
public housing. Additional HUD program responsibilities which relate or 
impinge upon housing and community development include comprehensive 
planning assistance, metropolitan area planning coordination, new 
communities, relocation, urban renewal, model cities, rehabilitation 
loans and grants, neighborhood facilities grants, water and sewer 
grants, open space, public facilities loans, Operation BREAKTHROUGH, 
code enforcement, workable programs, and others.
    8. In view of its responsibilities described in paragraphs 1 and 7 
above, HUD possesses the necessary expertise to investigate, determine, 
and report to GSA on the availability of low- and moderate-income 
housing on a nondiscriminatory basis and to make findings as to such 
availability with respect to proposed locations for a federally-
constructed building or leased space which would be consistent with such 
reports. HUD also possesses the necessary expertise to advise GSA and 
other Federal agencies with respect to actions which would increase the 
availability of low- and moderate-income housing on a nondiscriminatory 
basis, once a site has been selected for a federally-constructed 
building or a lease executed for space, as well as to assist in 
increasing the availability of such housing through its own programs 
such as those described in paragraph 7 above.
    9. HUD and GSA agree that:
    (a) GSA will pursue the achievement of low- and moderate-income 
housing objectives and fair housing objectives, in accordance with its 
responsibilities recognized in paragraph 6 above, in all determinations, 
tentative and final, with respect to the location of both federally 
constructed buildings and leased buildings and space, and will make all 
reasonable efforts to make this policy known to all persons, 
organizations, agencies and others concerned with federally owned and 
leased buildings and space in a manner which will aid in achieving such 
objectives.
    (b) In view of the importance to the achievement of the objectives 
of this memorandum of agreement of the initial selection of a city or 
delineation of a general area for location of public buildings or leased 
space, GSA will provide the earliest possible notice to HUD of 
information with respect to such decisions so that HUD can carry out its 
responsibilities under this memorandum of agreement as effectively as 
possible.
    (c) Government-owned Public Buildings Projects:
    (1) In the planning for each new public buildings project under the 
Public Buildings Act of 1959, during the survey preliminary to the 
preparation and submission of a project development report, 
representatives of the regional office of GSA in which the project is 
proposed will consult with, and receive advice from, the regional office 
of HUD, and local planning and housing authorities concerning the 
present and planned availability of low- and moderate-income housing on 
a nondiscriminatory basis in the area where the project is to be 
located. Such advice will constitute the principal basis for GSA's 
consideration of the availability of such housing in accordance with 
paragraphs 6 and 9(a). A copy of the prospectus for each project which 
is authorized by the Committees on Public Works of the Congress in 
accordance with the requirements of section 7(a) of the Public Buildings 
Act of 1959, will be provided to HUD.
    (2) When a site investigation for an authorized public buildings 
project is conducted by regional representatives of GSA to identify a 
site on which the public building will be constructed, a representative 
from the regional office of HUD will participate in the site 
investigation for the purposes of providing a report on the availability 
of low- and moderate-income housing on a nondiscriminatory basis in the 
area of the investigation. Such report will constitute the principal 
basis for GSA's consideration of the availability of such housing in 
accordance with paragraphs 6 and 9(a).
    (d) Major lease actions having a significant socioeconomic impact on 
a community: At the time GSA and the agencies who will occupy the space 
have tentatively delineated the general area in which the leased space 
must be located in order that the agencies may effectively perform their 
missions and programs, the regional representative of HUD will be 
consulted by the regional representative of GSA who is responsible for 
the leasing action to obtain advice from HUD concerning the availability 
of low- and moderate-income housing on a nondiscriminatory basis to the 
delineated area. Such advice will constitute the principal basis for 
GSA's consideration of the availability of such housing in accordance 
with paragraphs 6 and 9(a). Copies of lease-construction prospectuses 
approved by the Committees on Public Works of the Congress in conformity 
with the provisions of the Independent Offices and Department of Housing 
and Urban Development appropriation acts, will be provided to HUD.
    (e) GSA and HUD will each issue internal operating procedures to 
implement this memorandum of understanding within a reasonable time 
after its execution. These procedures shall recognize the right of HUD, 
in the event of a disagreement between HUD and GSA representatives at 
the area or regional level, to bring such disagreement to

[[Page 235]]

the attention of GSA officials at headquarters in sufficient time to 
assure full consideration of HUD's views, prior to the making of a 
determination by GSA.
    (f) In the event a decision is made by GSA as to the location of a 
federally constructed building or leased space, and HUD has made 
findings, expressed in the advice given or a report made to GSA, that 
the availability to such location of low- and moderate-income housing on 
a nondiscriminatory basis is inadequate, the GSA shall provide the DHUD 
with a written explanation why the location was selected.
    (g) Whenever the advice or report provided by HUD in accordance with 
paragraph 9(c)(1), 9(c)(2), or 9(d) with respect to an area or site 
indicates that the supply of low-and moderate-income housing on a 
nondiscriminatory basis is inadequate to meet the needs of the personnel 
of the agency involved, GSA and HUD will develop an affirmative action 
plan designed to insure that an adequate supply of such housing will be 
available before the building or space is to be occupied or within a 
period of 6 months thereafter. The plan should provide for commitments 
from the community involved to initiate and carry out all feasible 
efforts to obtain a sufficient quantity of low- and moderate-income 
housing available to the agency's personnel on a nondiscriminatory basis 
with adequate access to the location of the building or space. It should 
include commitments by the local officials having the authority to 
remove obstacles to the provision of such housing, when such obstacles 
exist, and to take effective steps to assure its provision. The plan 
should also set forth the steps proposed by the agency to develop and 
implement a counseling and referral service to seek out and assist its 
personnel to obtain such housinng. As part of any plan during, as well 
as after its development, HUD agrees to give priority consideration to 
applications for assistance under its housing programs for the housing 
proposed to be provided in accordance with the plan.
    10. This memorandum will be reviewed at the end of 1 year, and 
modified to incorporate any provision necessary to improve its 
effectiveness in light of actual experience.

amended; and the Public Buildings Amendments of 1972 (40 U.S.C. 602a).


<R05>
Sec. 101-20.002  Basic policy.

    It is the responsibility of GSA to provide or otherwise arrange for 
all services required to house occupant agencies. GSA shall provide 
fully service space equivalent to that furnished in commercial practice.

[[Page 237]]


<R05>
Sec. 101-20.002-1  Government-owned buildings.

    (a) GSA will provide space alterations, repairs, and improvements 
sufficient to meet the mission requirements of occupant agencies, 
including mechanical and electrical systems which meet nationally 
recognized standards, within the limitations of available funding. When 
alterations are required, alterations which are essential for 
performance of agency missions or which improve the utilization rate 
shall be given priority over other alterations. Alterations solely for 
decorative or non-essential purposes shall be avoided.
    (b) GSA will ensure that space assigned to agencies is safe and that 
employees and visitors are not exposed to unnecessary risks.
    (c) Buildings will be cleaned and maintained at a service level 
equivalent to that normally furnished commercially in similar space.
    (d) GSA will make every effort to provide or arrange for a 
reasonable amount of protective services to ensure the physical security 
of occupants and visitors, to safeguard the Government's property 
interests, and to maintain order.
    (e) GSA shall ensure that physically handicapped persons will have 
ready access to space assigned to occupant agencies. GSA shall provide 
building standards and shall prescribe and enforce appropriate 
guidelines in accordance with applicable statutes, regulations and 
executive orders.
    (f) GSA is responsible for ensuring the availability of parking 
spaces for officials needs. Parking priorities are as established in 
Sec. 101-20.104.

commercial sector shall be arranged by GSA on a reimbursable basis, as 
provided in Sec. 101-20.106.
    (h) GSA may, by agreement with occupant agencies, delegate authority 
to perform specified functions with respect to the operation, 
maintenance or repair of GSA-assigned space.
    (i) GSA will maintain a comprehensive energy management program to 
reduce energy consumption and costs in Federal buildings. GSA will apply 
energy-efficient and economical operating and maintenance procedures, 
will make cost-effective repairs and alterations, will incorporate 
design features which will minimize the life cycle cost of buildings, 
and will ensure continuity of services through contingency planning.
    (j) Occupant agencies shall assist in the management of buildings by 
exercising economy in the use of utilities, by observing professional 
standards of neatness and cleanliness, and by taking all reasonable 
precautions to avoid the risk of accidents and fires. Occupant agencies 
shall also document and report to GSA any hazardous or unhealthy 
conditions in GSA-assigned space.
    (k) Consultations with occupant agencies and their safety 
representatives will be held whenever substantial alterations or repairs 
are proposed to be undertaken, or when GSA proposes to make significant 
changes to the standard level of services. GSA will consider the 
comments of occupant agencies before final decisions are made. GSA will 
make every reasonable effort to involve representatives of occupant 
agencies in the planning for such proposed alterations, repairs, and 
changes in services.
    (l) It is the general policy of GSA to provide space and systems 
which substantially conform to nationally recognized standards, when 
applicable. GSA may, however, adopt other standards for space and 
systems in Federally-controlled facilities in order to conform to 
diverse statutory requirements, to implement cost-reduction efforts, or 
to better effect overall Government objectives.


<R05>
Sec. 101-20.002-2  Leased buildings.

    (a) Standards for space and services in leased buildings will be 
equivalent to standards for Government-owned space. However, the scope 
of the functions performed by GSA will be modified to reflect the 
lessor's responsibilities for operations, maintenance and protection 
under the terms of the lease.
    (b) Alterations, improvements and repairs in leased buildings shall 
be performed by GSA to the extent of the Government's responsibility 
under the

[[Page 238]]

lease. Such alterations shall not, however, exceed the limitations of 
the Economy Act (40 U.S.C. 278(a)) except as otherwise provided by law.
    (c) Occupant agencies are not authorized to negotiate with lessors 
or to place orders for alterations or building services, except where

fire, explosion, or the discovery of an explosive device (not including 
a bomb threat), occupants shall be evacuated or relocated in accordance 
with the plan without consultation. This shall be accomplished by 
sounding the fire alarm system or by other appropriate means.
    (c) When there is advance notice of an emergency, the Designated 
Official shall initiate appropriate action according to the plan.
    (d) After normal duty hours, the senior Federal official present 
shall represent the Designated Official or his/her alternates and shall 
initiate action to cope with emergencies in accordance with the plans.

Sec. 101-20.104  Parking facilities.

    (a) Parking facilities shall be compatible with the character of 
neighborhoods and consistent with local planning requirements. They 
shall not adversely affect the use or appearance of property, and shall 
not create traffic hazards.
    (b) As necessary or upon agency request, GSA may provide for the 
regulation and policing of parking facilities. GSA will consult with 
primary occupant agencies prior to implementing procedural changes. Such 
regulation and policing may include:
    (1) The issuance of traffic rules and regulations;
    (2) The installation of signs and markings for traffic control. 
(Signs and markings shall be in conformance with the Manual on Uniform 
Traffic Control Devices published by the Department of Transportation);
    (3) The issuance of citations for parking violations; and
    (4) The immobilization or removal of illegally parked vehicles.
    (c) When the use of parking space is controlled as in paragraph (b) 
of this section, all privately owned vehicles other than those 
authorized to use designated visitor or service areas must display a 
parking permit. This requirement may be waived in parking facilities 
where the number of available space regularly exceeds the demand for 
such spaces.
    (d) GSA may delegate the responsibility for management, regulation, 
and policing of parking facilities by agreement with occupant agencies 
or by contractual arrangements with lessors or parking management 
contractors. Where possible, existing contracts shall be amended or 
modified before renewal to conform with the policies of this regulation.

[[Page 243]]

    (e) Privately owned vehicles converted for propane carburetion will 
not be permitted in underground parking facilities unless the owner 
provides to the occupant agency and the GSA buildings manager the 
installer's certification that the installation methods and equipment 
meet the standards in National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 
Standard No. 58.


<R05>
Sec. 101-20.104-1  Allocation and assignment of parking for official needs.

    GSA is responsible for ensuring the availability of parking spaces 
for official needs. GSA may, by mutual agreement, delegate allocation 
and assignment responsibilities to occupant agencies or boards, 
commissions, and similar groups. GSA and other agencies with assignment 
responsibilities shall determine the appropriate number of spaces at 
each facility for official purposes; such determinations will be based 
upon submissions of information from occupant agencies regarding their 
needs. Parking spaces in controlled facilities shall first be reserved 
for official needs, in the following order of priority:
    (a) At buildings containing U.S. Postal Service mailing operations, 
official postal vehicles.
    (b) Government-owned vehicles used for criminal apprehension, 
firefighting, and other emergency functions.
    (c) Privately owned vehicles of Federal judges appointed under 
Article III of the Constitution and of Members of Congress. (This 
priority does not extend to members of their staffs.)
    (d) Other Government-owned and leased vehicles, including motor pool 
vehicles and vehicles assigned for general use.
    (e) Service vehicles and vehicles of patrons and visitors. 
(Accommodations for handicapped visitors shall be provided when 
necessitated by agency program requirements. Agencies are encouraged to 
provide accommodations for handicapped visitors.)


<R05>
Sec. 101-20.104-2  Allocation and assignment of employee parking spaces.

    (a) Parking spaces not required for official needs may be used for 
employee parking.
    (b) GSA (or other agencies having assignment responsibilities) will 
determine the total number of spaces available for employee parking. 
Normally, a separate determination will be made for each parking 
facility. In major metropolitan areas, however, GSA and occupant 
agencies may ascertain that zonal allocations would achieve more 
efficient use of space or equality in the availability of parking.
    (c) Space available for employee parking will be allocated for 
occupant agency use on a equitable basis. Allocations may be made in 
proportion to each agency's share of building space, office space, or 
total employee population, as appropriate. In certain cases, GSA may 
allow a third party, such as a board composed of representatives of 
agencies sharing space, to determine proper reallocations among the 
agencies.
    (d) Agencies shall in turn assign spaces to their employees, using 
the following order of priority:
    (1) Severely handicapped employees. Justifications based on medical 
opinion may be required.
    (2) Executive personnel and persons who work unusual hours.
    (3) Vanpool/carpool vehicles.
    (4) Privately owned vehicles of occupant agency employees which are 
regularly used for Government business at least 12 days per month and 
which qualify for reimbursement of mileage and travel expenses under 
Government travel regulations.
    (5) Other privately owned vehicles of employees, on a space-
available basis. (In locations where parking allocations are made on a 
zonal basis, GSA and affected agencies may cooperate to issue additional 
rules, as appropriate.)


<R05>
Sec. 101-20.104-3  Utilization of parking.

    (a) Agencies shall develop, implement, and maintain ridesharing 
programs. (Guidelines for the administration of ridesharing programs are 
contained in FPMR Amendment A-36.)
    (b) GSA will take all feasible measures to improve the utilization 
of parking facilities. Such measures may include the conducting of 
surveys and studies, the periodic review of parking space allocations, 
the dissemination of parking information to agencies, the

[[Page 244]]

implementation of parking incentives which promote ridesharing, the use 
of stack parking practices where appropriate, and the employment of 
parking management contractors and concessionaires.


<R05>
Sec. 101-20.104-4  Guidelines for agency implementation.

    (a) In most instances, the assignment of individual reserved spaces 
should be minimized; this allows the number of permits to be 
overallocated and results in increased efficiency.
    (b) In order to promote fuel conservation, reduce traffic 
congestion, reduce the demand for parking spaces, and reduce air 
pollution, agencies are encouraged to make available as many parking 
spaces as possible for the use of vanpools/carpools.
    (c) Agency procedures for the assignment of parking spaces should be 
maintained in writing. Provisions for reviewing assignments, enforcing 
compliance with regulations, and enforcing penalties for 
misrepresentation on applications are also recommended.
    (d) Occupant agencies should make every effort to schedule arrival 
and departure times for employees to facilitate ridesharing.
    (e) Subject to the availability of satisfactory and secure space and 
facilities, agencies should reserve areas for the parking of bicycles 
and other two-wheeled vehicles. Bicycles should not be transported on 
elevators or via stairways, nor should they be parked in offices.
    (f) Implementation of the provisions of this regulation may require 
consultation, as appropriate, with recognized labor organizations.


<R05>
Sec. 101-20.105  Accident and fire prevention.

    Standards for GSA-assigned space will conform to those presented by 
the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) of 1970 (Public Law 91-
596); Executive Order 12196; 29 CFR part 1960, and applicable GSA fire 
and safety criteria. Occupants and visitors will not be exposed to 
unnecessary risks. Safeguards which minimize personal harm, property 
damage, and impairment of Governmental operations, and which allow 
emergency forces to accomplish their missions effectively, will be 
provided. To the maximum extent feasible, GSA will provide space which 
meets or exceeds these objectives.


<R05>
Sec. 101-20.105-1  Responsibilities of occupant agencies.

    (a) Each occupant agency shall maintain a neat and orderly facility 
to minimize the risk of accidental injuries and fires. All exits, 
accesses to exits, and accesses to emergency equipment shall be kept 
clear at all times.
    (b) Hazardous explosive or combustible materials shall not be 
brought into buildings unless authorized by appropriate agency officials 
and by GSA and unless protective arrangements determined necessary by 
GSA have been provided. All draperies, curtains, or other hanging 
materials shall be of non-combustible or flame-resistant fabric. 
Freestanding partitions and space dividers shall be limited combustible, 
and fabric coverings shall also be flame resistant.
    (c) Occupant agencies shall cooperate with GSA to develop and 
maintain fire prevention programs. Such programs shall ensure the 
maximum safety of the occupants by:
    (1) Training employees to use protective equipment and educating 
employees to take appropriate fire safety precautions in their work, 
including participating in at least one fire drill each year, and
    (2) Ensuring that facilities are kept in the safest condition 
practicable, and conducting periodic inspections in accordance with 
Executive Order 12196 and 29 CFR part 1960.
    (d) Accidents resulting from building system or maintenance 
deficiencies which involve personal injury or property damage in GSA-
assigned space will be reported immediately to the GSA buildings 
manager.
    (e) Each occupant agency shall appoint a safety, health and fire 
protection liaison to represent the occupant agency with GSA.


<R05>
Sec. 101-20.105-2  Correction of hazardous conditions.

    (a) GSA is responsible for correcting hazards associated with the 
condition

[[Page 245]]

of the space it assigns, including hazards related to building features, 
fixtures, and systems. GSA is also responsible for correcting hazards in 
common, joint, and public use spaces. Occupant agencies are responsible 
for correcting hazards associated with their use of assigned space, 
including those related to the operation of their program equipment.
    (b) Hazardous conditions within the occupant agency's responsibility 
to correct shall be corrected within 30 workdays when possible. 
Imminently dangerous conditions shall be corrected immediately upon 
their discovery. If more than 30 workdays are required for correction, 
an abatement plan shall be prepared in accordance with 29 CFR part 1960. 
Corrective alteration measures may be undertaken in accordance with 
Sec. 101-20.106, Reimbursable services.
    (c) Conditions within GSA's responsibility to correct shall be 
identified, documented and presented to the GSA buildings manager. 
Imminently dangerous conditions shall be corrected immediately upon 
their discovery. When an imminently dangerous condition as defined by 29 
CFR 1960.28 exists, this report shall be made by telephone. Upon receipt 
of a properly documented report of hazardous conditions, GSA will 
promptly investigate, determine a plan to resolve the problems, and 
inform the occupant agency. Such reports shall state the hazardous 
condition and cite references to specific OSHA standards violated. In 
cases involving health problems, agencies shall provide to GSA an 
industrial hygienist's report of an investigation of the alleged 
problem, which must include a description of the problem, results of 
testing, and recommendations for correction. When resolution will take 
more than 30 workdays, GSA shall prepare an abatement plan in accordance 
with 29 CFR part 1960, shall furnish this plan to the occupant agency 
for review and subsequent follow-up, and shall give priority to prompt 
abatement of the conditions.


<R05>
Sec. 101-20.105-3  Smoking.

    (a) Pursuant to Executive Order 13058, ``Protecting Federal 
Employees and the Public From Exposure to Tobacco Smoke in the Federal 
Workplace'' (3 CFR, 1997 Comp., p. 216), it is the policy of the 
executive branch to establish a smoke-free environment for Federal 
employees and members of the public visiting or using Federal 
facilities. The smoking of tobacco products is prohibited in all 
interior space owned, rented, or leased by the executive branch of the 
Federal Government, and in any outdoor areas under executive branch 
control in front of air intake ducts.
    (b) Exceptions. (1) The policy does not apply in designated smoking 
areas that are enclosed and exhausted directly to the outside and away 
from air intake ducts, and are maintained under negative pressure (with 
respect to surrounding spaces) sufficient to contain tobacco smoke 
within the designated area. Agency officials shall not require workers 
to enter such areas during business hours while smoking is ongoing.
    (2) The policy does not extend to any residential accommodation for 
persons voluntarily or involuntarily residing, on a temporary or long 
term basis, in a building owned, leased, or rented by the Federal 
Government.
    (3) The policy does not extend to those portions of federally owned 
buildings leased, rented, or otherwise provided in their entirety to 
nonfederal parties.
    (4) The policy does not extend to places of employment in the 
private sector or in other nonfederal governmental units that serve as 
the permanent or intermittent duty station of one or more Federal 
employees.
    (5) Agency heads may establish limited and narrow exceptions that 
are necessary to accomplish agency missions. Such exceptions must be in 
writing, approved by the agency head, and to the fullest extent possible 
provide protection of nonsmokers from exposure to environmental tobacco 
smoke. Authority to establish such exceptions may not be delegated.
    (c) Agency heads have responsibility to determine which areas are to 
be smoking and which areas are to be non-smoking areas. In exercising 
this responsibility, agency heads will give appropriate consideration to 
the views of the employees affected and/or their representatives and are 
to take into

[[Page 246]]

consideration the health issues involved. Nothing in this section 
precludes an agency from establishing more stringent guidelines. 
Agencies in multi-tenant buildings are encouraged to work together to 
identify designated smoking areas.
    (d) Agency heads shall evaluate the need to restrict smoking at 
doorways and in courtyards under executive branch control in order to 
protect workers and visitors from environmental tobacco smoke, and may 
restrict smoking in these areas in light of this evaluation.
    (e) Agency heads shall be responsible for monitoring and controlling 
areas designated for smoking and for ensuring that these areas are 
identified by proper signs. Suitable uniform signs reading ``Designated 
Smoking Area'' shall be furnished and installed by the agency.
    (f) Suitable, uniform signs reading ``No Smoking Except in 
Designated Areas'' shall be placed on or near entrance doors of 
buildings subject to this section. These signs shall be furnished and 
installed by the GSA Building Manager in buildings operated by GSA. It 
shall not be necessary to display a sign in every room of each building.
    (g) This smoking policy applies to the judicial branch when it 
occupies space in buildings controlled by the executive branch. 
Furthermore, the Federal chief judge in a local jurisdiction may be 
deemed to be comparable to an agency head and may establish exceptions 
for Federal jurors and others as indicated in paragraph (b)(5) of this 
section.
    (h) Prior to implementation of this section, where there is an 
exclusive representative for the employees, the agencies shall meet 
their obligation under the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations 
Act (5 U.S.C. 7101 et seq.) In all other cases, agencies should consult 
directly with employees.

    (j) Office design, space planning, and office automation 
installation support and services.


<R05>
Sec. 101-20.106-1  Placing of orders for reimbursable alterations by occupant agencies.

    (a) Where GSA has indefinite quantity contracts and/or unit price 
agreements available for accomplishment of space alterations in 
Government owned and leased buildings, agencies should order against 
these contracts and agreements, except when it is not in the 
Government's best interest. Agencies wishing to use this authority shall 
submit names of their proposed ordering officials to the GSA buildings 
manager, who will submit them to the GSA contracting officer. The 
contracting officer shall designate in writing the ordering officials 
and will authorize the contractor to accept orders from the designated 
ordering officials. The GSA

[[Page 247]]

contracting officer shall advise the agencies' ordering officials in 
writing of their responsibilities, authorities, and limitations under 
these contracts and agreements.
    (b) No individual order, or combinations of orders for a single 
alteration project, shall exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, 
as defined in 41 U.S.C. 252a, and agencies shall not split orders so as 
to circumvent this limitation.
    (c) For all orders placed against GSA contracts or agreements, 
agency ordering officials shall obtain prior written project review by 
GSA and provide a copy of the ordering document and final payment 
document to the GSA buildings manager. Agencies are responsible for 
inspecting and certifying satisfactory completion of the work, and for 
ensuring contractor compliance with contract provisions. The final 
payment document shall be supported by GSA Form 1142, Release of Claims; 
GSA Form 2419, Certification of Payments to Subcontractors and Supplies; 
and certification that the work has been inspected and accepted.
    (d) Agencies may not negotiate with contractors for items not 
specifically priced under indefinite quantity contracts and/or price 
agreements.
    (e) Where no GSA contracts or agreements are in effect, an agency 
may contract directly for services up to the simplified acquisition 
threshold per project after written review by GSA. Agencies contracting 
directly must provide GSA with complete documentation of the scope of 
work and contract specifications at the time of submission. Each project 
shall include appropriate reviews by the regional safety staff. If 
contracting for security systems, agencies must submit the design work 
for regional Federal Protective Service Division review. Agencies shall 
be responsible for inspecting and certifying satisfactory completion of 
the ordered work. All work must conform to GSA fire and safety 
standards. GSA at anytime has the authority to make inspections and 
require correction if the project is found not in compliance with GSA 
reviews or fire and safety standards. As-built drawings must be 
submitted to GSA's buildings manager within 30 days of completion of the 
work.

<R05>
Sec. 101-20.106-2  Limitations on provision of reimbursable services by GSA.

    In order to reduce processing costs of documents and to improve 
efficiency of service delivery, requests for reimbursable work to be 
performed or arranged by GSA may be subject to the following 
requirements:
    (a) Individual work authorizations (e.g., GSA Form 2957's) for which 
total expenses as estimated by GSA are less than $500 need not be 
processed by GSA, but may be returned to the requesting agency. Unless 
the work is related to security or required to correct an unhealthful or 
unsafe condition, occupant agencies may be required to hold all such 
requests until the reimbursable work in question can be aggregated into 
a single request for at least $500.
    (b) The restrictions of paragraph (a) of this section are not 
mandatory, but may be applied by GSA when their application is in the 
best interests of the Government from the standpoint of cost 
effectiveness.
    (c) The restrictions of paragraph (a) of this section do not apply 
to orders placed against existing blanket or open-end authorizations 
which exceed $500 and which show obligated and unused fund balances 
sufficient to perform the work.
    (d) Agencies requesting reimbursable services are responsible for 
verifying and approving GSA estimates within 30 calendar days following 
submission of such estimates to the requester. Reimbursable work 
requests for which estimates have not been approved within 30 days will 
be canceled.


<R05>
Sec. 101-20.107  Energy conservation.

    Agencies shall comply with the energy conservation guidelines set 
forth in 10 CFR part 436 (Federal Energy Management and Planning 
Programs) and shall observe the energy conservation policies cited 
herein.
    (a) Agencies shall ensure that lights and equipment are turned off 
when not needed, that ventilation is not blocked

[[Page 248]]

or impeded, and that windows and other building accesses are closed 
during the heating and cooling seasons.
    (b) Except where special circumstances exist, illumination levels 
shall be maintained as near as is practical to the following standards:
    (1) 50 foot-candles at work station surfaces, measured at a height 
of 30 inches above floor level, during working hours (For visually 
difficult or critical tasks, additional lighting may be authorized by 
the GSA buildings manager or by agencies that have been given delegated 
authority to perform buildings management functions.);
    (2) 30 foot-candles in work areas during working hours, measured at 
30 inches above floor level;
    (3) 10 foot-candles, but not less than 1 foot-candle nonwork areas, 
sufficient to ensure safety in non-work areas during working hours. 
(Normally this will require levels of 5 foot-candles at elevator 
boarding areas, minimum of 1 foot-candle at the middle of corridors and 
stairwells as measured at the walking surface, and 1 foot-candle at the 
middle of corridors and stairwells as measured at the walking surface, 
and 10 foot-candles in storage areas.); and
    (4) Other lighting essential for safety and security purposes, 
including exit signs and exterior lights, shall be maintained.
    (c) Within the limitations of the building systems, heating and 
cooling systems shall be operated in the most overall energy efficient 
and economical manner.
    (1) Temperatures will be maintained to maximize customer 
satisfaction by conforming to local commercial equivalent temperature 
levels and operating practices. GSA will seek to minimize energy use 
while operating its buildings in this manner. During non-working hours, 
heating temperatures shall be set no higher than 55 degrees Fahrenheit 
and air-conditioning will not be provided except as necessary to return 
space temperatures to a suitable level for the beginning of working 
hours.
    (2) The locations used for measurement of temperatures to determine 
compliance will be representative of the spaces to be heated or cooled.
    (3) Work stations which are the most adversely affected may be the 
basis for establishing the temperature levels throughout that portion of 
the building.
    (4) Reheating, humidification, and simultaneous heating and cooling 
shall not be permitted.
    (5) During extreme weather conditions, building systems shall be 
operated as necessary to protect the physical condition of the building.
    (d) The operation of portable heaters, fans, and other such devices 
in Government-controlled space is prohibited unless authorized by the 
GSA buildings manager or by agencies that have been given delegated 
authority to perform buildings management functions.
    (e) During working hours in periods of heating and cooling, provide 
ventilation in accordance with ASHRAE Standard 62, Ventilation for 
Acceptable Indoor Air Quality where physically practical. Where not 
physically practical, provide the maximum allowable amount of 
ventilation during periods of heating and cooling and pursue 
opportunities to increase ventilation up to current standards. ASHRAE 
Standard 62 is available from ASHRAE Publications Sales, 1791 Tullie 
Circle NE, Atlanta, GA 30329-2305.
    (f) Energy standards for existing buildings will be no less 
stringent than those prescribed by the American Society of Heating, 
Refrigerating, and Air Conditioning Engineers and the Illuminating 
Engineering Society of North American in ASHRAE/IES Standard 90A-1980 as 
amended by Department of Energy (DOE). These energy standards are 
applicable where they can be achieved through life cycle, cost effective 
actions.
    (g) Exceptions to the foregoing policies may be necessary for 
specialized requirements of for agencies to accomplish their missions 
more effectively and efficently. Such exceptions may be granted by the 
GSA buildings manager or by agencies that have been given delegated 
authority to perform buildings management functions.
    (h) Contracting officers shall ensure that all new lease contracts 
are in conformance with the policies prescribed

[[Page 249]]

in this Sec. 101-20.107. Existing lease contracts shall be administered 
in accordance with these policies to the maximum extent feasible.
    (i) Each agency shall report to the Department of Energy (DOE) the 
energy consumption in buildings, facilities, vehicles, and equipment 
under its control within 45 calendar days after the end of each quarter 
as specified in the DOE Federal Energy usage Report DOE F 6200.2

operations.
    (c) Subject to the availability of space, prior to establishing 
concessions, GSA will ensure that:
    (1) The proposed concession will offer only essential services which 
are needed by employees, and which cannot be conveniently obtained from 
existing facilities, (Consultation will be held with occupant 
agencies.);
    (2) The proposed concession will be established and operated in 
conformance with applicable policies, safety, health, and sanitation 
codes, laws, regulations, etc., and will not contravene the terms of any 
lease or other contractual arrangement;
    (3) Sufficient funds are legally available to cover all costs for 
which the Government may be responsible; and
    (4) All contracts will be financially self-supporting and not 
compete with nearby commercial enterprise.
    (d) Public Law 104-52, Section 636, prohibits the sale of tobacco 
products in vending machines in Government-owned and leased space under 
the custody and control of GSA. The Administrator of GSA or the head of 
an Agency may designate areas not subject to the

controlled property provided the location or operation of such facility 
would not adversely affect the interests of the United States. Blind 
vendors shall also be given priority on GSA-controlled property in the

<R05>
Sec. 101-20.202  Establishing vending facilities.

    (a) GSA shall not acquire a building by ownership, rent, or lease, 
or occupy a building to be constructed, substantially altered, or 
renovated unless it is determined that such buildings contain or will 
contain a ``satisfactory site'' as defined in 34 CFR 395.1q, for the 
location and operating of a blind vending facility.
    (b) In accordance with 34 CFR 395.31, GSA shall provide the 
appropriate State licensing agency with written notice of its intention 
to acquire or otherwise occupy such building. Providing notification 
shall be the responsibility of the Buildings Management Division, GSA.


<R05>
Sec. 101-20.203  Application for permit.

    Applications for permits for the operation of vending facilities 
other than cafeterias shall be made in writing on the appropriate form,

<R05>
Sec. 101-20.204  Terms of permit.

    Every permit shall describe the location of the vending facility 
including any vending machines located on other than the facility 
premises and shall be subject to the following provisions:
    (a) The permit shall be issued in the name of the applicant State 
licensing agency which shall:
    (1) Prescribe such procedures necessary to assure that in the 
selection of vendors and employees for vending facilities there shall be 
no discrimination because of sex, race, age, creed, color, national 
origin, physical or mental disability, or political affiliation; and
    (2) Take the necessary action to assure that vendors do not 
discriminate against any persons in furnishing, or by refusing to 
furnish, to such person or persons the use of any vending facility, 
including any and all services, privileges, accommodations, and 
activities provided thereby, and comply with title VI of the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964 and GSA regulations issued pursuant thereto.
    (b) The permit shall be issued for an indefinite period of time 
subject to suspension or termination on the basis of compliance with 
agreed upon terms.
    (c) The permit shall provide that:
    (1) No charge shall be made to the State licensing agency for normal 
cleaning, maintenance, and repair of the building structure in and 
adjacent to the vending facility areas;
    (2) Cleaning necessary for sanitation, and the maintenance of 
vending facilities and vending machines in an orderly condition at all 
times, and the installation, maintenance, repair, replacement, 
servicing, and removal of vending facility equipment shall be without 
cost to GSA; and
    (3) Articles sold at vending facilities operated by blind licensees 
may consist of newspapers, periodicals, publications, confections, 
tobacco products, foods, beverages, chances for any lottery authorized 
by State law and conducted by an agency of a State within such State, 
and other articles or services as are determined by the State licensing 
agency, in consultation with GSA to be suitable for a particular 
location. Such articles and services may

[[Page 251]]

be dispensed automatically or manually and may be prepared on or off the 
premises. Public Law 104-52, Section 636, prohibits the sale of tobacco 
products in vending machines in Government-owned and leased space under 
the custody and control of GSA.
    (d) The permit shall further provide that vending facilities shall 
be operated in compliance with applicable health, sanitation, and 
building codes or ordinances.
    (e) The permit shall further provide that installation, 
modification, relocation, removal, and renovation of vending facilities 
shall be subject to the prior approval and supervision of the Director, 
Buildings Management Division, GSA, and the State licensing agency; that 
costs of relocations initiated by the State licensing agency shall be 
paid by the State licensing agency; that costs of relocations initiated 
by the Director, Buildings Management Division, shall be paid by GSA; 
and that all plumbing, electrical, and mechanical costs related to the 
renovation of existing facilities shall be paid by GSA.
    (f) The operation of a cafeteria by a blind vendor shall be covered 
by a contractual agreement and not by a permit. The State licensing 
agency shall be expected to perform under the same contractual 
arrangement applicable to commercial cafeteria operators.

Act, or the regulations in this part and any other unresolved matters

authorized persons who shall register upon entry to the property and 
shall, when requested, display Government or other identifying 
credentials to the Federal Protective Officers or other authorized

<R05>
Sec. 101-21.000  Scope of part.

    This part prescribes policies and procedures to be followed for the 
furnishing of space and services by GSA in Government-owned and -leased 
buildings.


<R05>
Sec. 101-21.001  Authority.

    This part implements the applicable provisions of the Public 
Buildings Amendments of 1988, Public Buildings Amendments of 1972 (86 
Stat. 216), the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 
(63 Stat. 377), the Public Buildings Act of 1959 (73 Stat. 479). and the 
Reorganization Plan No. 18 of 1950 (40 U.S.C. 490 note).


<R05>
Sec. 101-21.002  Basic policy.

    (a) GSA will charge for space and services furnished by GSA (unless 
exempted by the Administrator of General Services) a Rent charge which 
will approximate commercial charges for comparable space and services. 
This is accomplished by using an appraisal procedure. The appraisal is 
based on a fully serviced lease and reflects the standard level of 
services provided by GSA. Services approximate those provided in the 
private sector.
    (b) GSA may furnish services additional to those included in the 
Rent on a reimbursable basis.
    (c) GSA may furnish alterations on a reimbursable basis in buildings 
where GSA is responsible for alterations only.


<R05>
Sec. 101-21.003  Definition of terms.

    The following definitions are established for terms used in 
Subchapter D of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 101-21.003-1  Federal Buildings Fund.

    Federal Buildings Fund means the fund into which Rent charges and 
other revenues are deposited, and collections cited in section 210(j) of 
the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended 
(40 U.S.C. 490(j)), and from which monies shall be available for 
expenditures for real property management and related activities in such 
amounts as are specified in annual appropriation acts without regard to 
fiscal year limitations.


<R05>
Sec. 101-21.003-2  Rent.

    Rent means the rate charged for GSA-controlled space. GSA-controlled 
space is that space assigned to an agency by GSA by authority of the 
Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended, or 
by authority of any other statute. It includes

[[Page 258]]

any space for which an agency pays GSA directly. The Rent charge 
approximates commercial charges for comparable space and services.


<R05>
Sec. 101-21.003-3  Standard levels of service.

    Standard levels of service means those services provided as part of 
the Rent charge, depending upon the type of space occupied, and as 
defined in Subpart 101-21.3 ad 101-20.1 of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 101-21.003-4  Special services.

    Special services means those services that are not included in the 
standard level of services but are provided by GSA on a reimbursable 
basis upon request.


<R05>
Sec. 101-21.003-5  Space and services.

    Space and services means the combination of space occupied and the 
related services provided for that space.


<R04>
                        Subpart 101-21.1--General


<R05>
Sec. 101-21.101  Background.

    The principal intent of section 210(d) of the Federal Property and 
Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended is to promote greater 
efficiency and effectiveness in the use and management of Government-
owned and -leased space. To this end, the assessment of charges that 
approximate commercial rates for comparable space and services will 
stimulate efficient space utilization, induce performance budgeting 
through the more realistic reporting of program costs, provide the basis 
for a responsible landlord-tenant relationship between GSA and other 
agencies, and establish a sound financial structure for the acquisition, 
construction, repair, alteration, maintenance, protection, and operation 
of real property.


<R05>
Sec. 101-21.102  Applicability.

    Rules and regulations in this part 101-21 apply to all agencies 
assigned space by GSA.


<R04>
                         Subpart 101-21.2--Rent


<R05>
Sec. 101-21.200  General.

    This subpart prescribes the policies and procedures governing the 
establishment of the Rent charge for space and services provided by GSA.


<R05>
Sec. 101-21.201  Determination of rent.

    (a) The Rent charge is established by GSA and approved by the Office 
of Management and Budget. The charge reflects approximate equivalent 
commercial rates for comparable space and services, and is based on the 
type, quality, and geographic location of the space provided. Rent 
charges are based on appraisals performed by professional appraisers 
every five years and updated in the intervening years by changes in the 
local Consumer Price Index (CPI). Adjustments for increases or decreases 
in service and utility costs in the area where the building is located 
are based on weighted averages of amounts expended by GSA.
    (b) Rent charges for GSA-controlled space entering the inventory 
after budget estimates are provided to customer agencies, are developed 
by appraisal prior to the assignment of the space. Annual adjustments 
are made as previously explained in this section.


<R05>
Sec. 101-21.202  Joint-use space.

    In those buildings where GSA has assignment responsibility and there 
is joint-use space such as cafeterias, auditoriums, conference rooms, 
credit unions, visitor parking spaces not specifically assigned, and 
snack bars, each agency provided access to or use of the facilities 
occupying the joint-use space will be charged a pro rata share of the 
space costs based on the percentage of the space assigned.


<R05>
Sec. 101-21.203  Exceptions.

    In those buildings where GSA is responsible only for alterations, 
the charges for such alterations will approximate the cost incurred.


<R05>
Sec. 101-21.204  Exemptions.

    The Administrator of General Services may exempt any occupant from 
Rent if he determines that application of the charge would be infeasible 
or impractical. Requests for exemption must be made in writing to the 
Administrator.

[[Page 259]]


<R05>
Sec. 101-21.205  Space and services provided by other executive agencies.

    Any executive agency other than GSA that provides to anyone space 
and services is authorized to charge the occupant for the space and 
services at rates approved by the Administrator of General Services.


<R05>
Sec. 101-21.206  Revision of rent rates.

    GSA will review Rent rates annually to insure that they approximate 
commercial rates. Rates will be revised according to the criteria 
described in Sec. 101-21.201. GSA will not increase its rates without 
notification through the Budget Estimate process except in the case of 
gross errors. Even in this special case, affected agencies are entitled 
to an opportunity to budget for the increase, if the revised total Rent 
charge is higher than the amount shown initially in the budget estimate. 
Eighteen months notice is generally given for an agency to budget for 
the increased Rent charges.


<R05>
Sec. 101-21.207  Annual projections.

    Annual projections of space assignments and related services are 
prescribed to provide occupant agencies with accurate data necessary for 
budget submission. Procedures for annual projections are described in 
Sec. 101-21.601.


<R04>
              Subpart 101-21.3--Standard Levels of Service


<R05>
Sec. 101-21.300  General.

    The levels of service included in Rent approximate those currently 
furnished in commercial practice. They are based on the effort required 
to service the occupant agency's space for a 5-day week (Monday to 
Friday), one-shift regular work schedule. Adequate building start-up 
services before the occupant agency starts the regular work schedule and 
shutdown services after the occupant agency ceases the regular work 
schedule, even though the working hours of the occupant agency may be 
staggered, will be provided by GSA. Space, automatic elevator systems, 
lights and small office and business machines may be used on an 
incidental basis 24 hours a day, 7 days a week without additional 
payment to GSA where access by the occupant is available without 
additional cost to GSA.


<R05>
Sec. 101-21.300-1  Flexitime.

    Occupant agencies who extend their regular work schedule by a system 
of flexible hours shall reimburse GSA for the actual cost of the 
additional services required.


<R05>
Sec. 101-21.301  Standard services for cleaning, mechanical operation, and maintenance.

    Standard services for cleaning, mechanical operation, and 
maintenance shall be accomplished in accordance with the established GSA 
standards as cited in Subpart 101-20.1 of part 101.20 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 101-21.302  Other standard services.

    GSA may provide additional services at appropriate levels and times 
that the Administrator of General Services determines to be necessary 
for efficient operations and proper servicing of space under the 
assignment responsibility of GSA.


<R05>
Sec. 101-21.303  Space exempted from the standard levels of service.

    The Administrator of General Services may exempt from the standard 
levels of service space for which, because of its limited square footage 
or functional use, application of the standard levels of service would 
be infeasible or impractical.


<R04>
                 Subpart 101-21.4 Reimbursable Services


<R05>
Sec. 101-21.401  Special services.

    Special services not included in the standard levels of service are 
provided by GSA on a reimbursable basis. Funds for reimbursable services 
should be included in occupant agency budget submissions.


<R05>
Sec. 101-21.402  Services performed by other agencies.

    Agencies occupying space under the assignment responsibility of GSA 
that perform or contract for services normally provided for in the Rent 
levied by GSA will be reimbursed by GSA for the actual cost of services 
performed.The amount of reimbursement

[[Page 260]]

will be limited to the cost of the services to GSA if GSA had provided 
them. Approval to perform or contract for such services must be obtained 
in advance from the appropriate GSA regional office.


<R04>
                   Subpart 101-21.5--Funding Projects.


<R05>
Sec. 101-21.501  GSA funding responsibility.

    Projects for the construction or alteration of public buildings, or 
for the alteration of leased buildings, for which GSA is responsible 
will be financed from the Federal Buildings Fund.


<R05>
Sec. 101-21.502  Funding responsibilities of other agencies.

    (a) A department or agency may request an appropriation to cover the 
cost of the construction or acquisition of a facility defined as a 
public building in Sec. 101-19.003-6 of this chapter when the 
Administrator of General Services has obtained the authorization 
therefor and concurs with the request, and approval has been given by 
the Office of Management and Budget. The construction or acquisition of 
the facility shall be performed by GSA.
    (b) GSA shall, upon the request of a department or agency, 
construct, alter, or acquire buildings other than public buildings which 
are normally financed by other agencies upon condition that funds to 
cover the cost of the work shall be transferred or reimbursement shall 
be made to GSA.
    (c) Each Federal agency shall be responsible for the financing of 
special use facilities and equipment not contemplated in the approved 
project.


<R04>
Subpart 101-21.6  Billings, Payments, and Related Budgeting Information 
 for Space and Services Furnished by the General Services Administration


<R05>
Sec. 101-21.600  Applicability.

    These rules and regulations apply to GSA and all agencies furnished 
space and related services by GSA.


<R05>
Sec. 101-21.601  Budgeting information for rent.

    (a) GSA provides to agencies summary level and detailed 
documentation in support of budgetary information it submits for the 
space and related services it furnishes. The documentation identifies 
organizations and organizational elements by an agency and bureau code 
numbering system.
    (b) Federal agencies that require relocation of other agencies 
because of expanding space needs are responsible for funding.
    (1) Moving, telecommunications, and related costs incurred by GSA in 
relocating displaced agencies and,
    (2) above standard alterations comparable to their previously 
occupied space on a square foot by square foot basis and,
    (3) Rent charges in excess of the amount budgeted by the displaced 
agency until such time (no more than 18 months) as the agency has had an 
opportunity to budget for the increase.


<R05>
Sec. 101-21.602  Billing procedures for rent charges.

    (a) Bills for Rent are normally rendered to the Central Office 
headquarters of each agency occupying space under the assignment 
responsibility of GSA. Under the OPAC (On-Line Payment and Collection), 
formerly SIBAC (Simplified Intragovernmental Billing and Collection) 
system, payment is to be processed at the level of organization within 
an agency which relates to a Treasury Department 8-digit station symbol. 
(Forms with references to SIBAC will continue to be used until stock is 
depleted.)
    (b) Bills for charges applicable to current space assignments are 
rendered quarterly at the beginning of the quarter. The billing includes 
adjustments for billing errors and changes in space assignments made 
prior to or during the previous quarter. Documentation delineating 
billing errors and changes in space assignments are provided with bills.
    (c) Agencies which have been assigned an 8-digit station symbol by 
the Treasury Department (OPAC agencies) are billed in accordance with 
the procedures prescribed by the Treasury Fiscal

[[Page 261]]

Requirements Manual, Part VI, Chapter 5000. Non-OPAC, designated as BOAC 
(Billed Office Address Code) agencies, are billed on GSA Form 789, 
Statement, Voucher, and Schedule of Withdrawals and Credits (referenced 
in Sec. 101-2.4902-789 of this chapter).


<R05>
Sec. 101-21.602-1  Billing credits.

    If an error in billing occurs, an adjustment may be requested 
through the applicable GSA Regional Office by letter, by GSA Form 2972 
for OPAC Agencies, or by GSA Form 2992 for BOAC agencies. GSA applies a 
one year limitation standard to adjustment requests received by letter 
or by GSA Form 2972 or 2992. Adjustment requests must be received within 
one year from the date of the Rent bill.


<R05>
Sec. 101-21.603  Budgeting information for reimbursable charges.

    Concurrently with the Rent listings for the applicable budget year, 
GSA provides an estimate of increases in the cost of recurring 
reimbursable services through the budget year based on projections 
provided by the Office of Management and Budget. These may be used to 
escalate actual costs from current year or preceding year data. The use 
of this information is not mandatory.


<R05>
Sec. 101-21.604  Billing procedures for reimbursable charges.

    (a) Charges for reimbursable services are billed to the level of 
organization within an agency which relates to a Department of the 
Treasury assigned 8-digit station symbol (OPAC agencies). This is 
accomplished under the On-Line Payment and Collection (OPAC) procedure. 
(See Treasury Fiscal Requirements Manual, Part VI, Chapter 5000.) BOAC 
(Billed Office Address Code) agencies are charged for reimbursable 
services by GSA billing directly to the agency paying office cited on 
the reimbursable work authorization request. (See Sec. 101-21.4901-2957, 
GSA Form 2957, Reimbursable Work Authorization.)
    (b) GSA Form 789, Statement, Voucher, and Schedule of Withdrawals 
and Credits is used for billing purposes for BOAC agencies. (See 
illustration at Sec. 101-2,4902-789 of this chapter).
    (c) Rates charged for recurring above-standard-level reimbursable 
services shall be fixed to recover the approximate cost incurred by GSA 
in providing such services. Recurring above-standard-level reimbursable 
services are those recurring services, such as cleaning or utilities, 
which cannot readily be differentiated from the same type of services 
included in the standard level.
    (d) The following basic types of reimbursable work are performed by 
GSA on a fixed price basis. The fixed price is the amount of the 
Reimbursable Work Authorization (RWA) which is the authorized amount:
    (1) Non-recurring services performed above standard levels of 
service, such as out-of-cycle painting;
    (2) Recurring services not included in the standard level for which 
a price can be established;
    (3) Repairs and alterations in buildings not controlled by GSA;
    (4) Special space alterations and adjustments performed by GSA in 
GSA-operated buildings, which are requested and financed by other 
agencies in accordance with Sec. 101-20.106, Reimbursable services, of 
this chapter; and
    (5) Alteration projects up to the prospectus threshold.
    (e) Where the amount of the RWA is less than $25,000, billing will 
occur at termination date. Other bills will be rendered at the 
customer's option, based on delivered orders either monthly or 
quarterly.
    (f) RWAs above the prospectus threshold shall be performed on an 
actual cost basis. In special circumstances, when GSA and the ordering 
agency agree, non-prospectus alterations work may be performed on an 
actual cost basis. GSA will make every effort to obtain approval and 
certification of additional funds before incurring any obligations in 
excess of 10 percent of the authorized amount or $500, whichever is 
greater. However, failure of GSA to notify the agency that obligations 
will exceed the authorized amount, regardless of dollar amount, does not 
relieve the agency of paying in full the actual costs.
    (g) A Reimbursable Work Authorization request (Form 2957 or other 
acceptable request) must be completed

[[Page 262]]

and approved by GSA and an agency official certifying that he/she has 
the authority to order the services and commit the agency to payment.
    (h) Bills for recurring above-standard level services are rendered 
in advance at an established cost equal to the estimated amount. This 
type of work authorization, with the right to cancel (subject to 
incurred costs and obligations) upon 60 days notice by either party must 
be completed and forwarded to GSA prior to the commencement of the 
period for which services are required. With the exception of recurring 
work authorizations for utilities, which GSA may limit to 3-month 
periods, each recurring type work authorization must authorize charges 
for the full period during the fiscal year that the services will be 
required. These work authorizations must always begin and end within the 
same fiscal year.
    (i) Agencies shall be responsible for timely payment and resolving 
any billing problems regarding orders they place under GSA contracts.
[57 FR 44693, Sept. 29, 1992, as amended at 62 FR 27973, May 22, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 101-21.605  Payment procedures.

    Payment of billings for space and services to OPAC agencies shall be 
in accordance with the procedures prescribed by the Treasury Fiscal 
Requirements Manual, Part VI, Chapter 5000. Billings for space and 
services to BOAC agencies shall be paid promptly by check or transfer 
document upon receipt of the billing document, in accordance with the 
GAO Manual for Guidance of Federal Agencies, title 7, Fiscal Procedures, 
Ch. 2, Sec. 7.3(b).


<R05>
Sec. 101-21.606  Reviews and appeals.

    (a) Agencies may at any time request a regional review of the 
measurement, classification, service levels provided, or charges 
assessed that pertain to the space assignment without resorting to 
formal procedures. Such requests do not constitute appeals and should be 
directed to the appropriate GSA regional office.
    (b) Agencies may file formal appeals on the Rent assessed, but only 
when the charge assessed is in excess of the comparable commercial 
square foot rates by 20 per cent or one dollar per square foot, 
whichever is greater, and when the quarterly Rent charge is in excess of 
the comparable commercial charge for that quality of space by $25,000. 
Formal appeals should be filed with the appropriate Regional 
Administrator. To determine if the Rent charge assessed is subject to 
appeal under this procedure, an agency is required to compare its 
assigned space with other space in the surrounding community that:
    (1) is available in similar size blocks of space in a comparable 
location,
    (2) is the same type of space as defined by GSA,
    (3) provides similar service levels as part of the charges,
    (4) contains similar contractual terms, conditions, and escalation 
clauses, and
    (5) represents a lease transaction completed at a similar point in 
time.


Data from at least three comparable locations will be necessary to 
demonstrate a market trend sufficient to warrant revising a Rent rate. 
Agencies filing appeals must develop documentation supporting an appeal 
of the Rent charge assessed using the factors described in this 
paragraph.

    (c) An appeal shall initially be filed by local agency officials 
with the appropriate GSA regional office and include all pertinent 
information and documentation supporting the need for the appeal. The 
GSA regional office will verify the data submitted and perform 
additional investigation as necessary. The GSA Regional Administrator 
will determine the validity of the appeal and will notify the appealing 
agency of his ruling.
    (d) A further appeal may be filed by the agency's bureau level 
officials with the Commissioner, Public Buildings Service, GSA, if an 
equitable resolution has not been obtained from the initial appeal. The 
second stage appeal must provide supporting information justifying the 
continuation of the appeal.
    (e) A head of an agency may further appeal to the Administrator of 
General Services only after the procedure to obtain prior resolution at 
the first two levels has been followed. Documentation of the procedure 
followed for prior resolution must accompany an appeal

[[Page 263]]

to the Administrator. Decisions made by the Administrator shall be 
final.
    (f) Adjustments to the Rent rates which result from the reviews and 
appeals procedure will be effective in the quarter in which the agency 
submitted a properly documented appeal. Adjusted rates remain in effect 
for the remainder of the fiscal year.
    (g) If an agency questions the rate developed for a specific 
building in the budget estimate, the appropriate GSA Regional Office 
should be contacted for information on the projected rate.

    Note: If an informal resolution is not reached after discussions 
with the Regional Real Estate personnel, the agency may appeal the rate, 
provided the criteria for an appeal are met. The appeal may be filed, as 
outlined in paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this section. The 
appeal documentation must include current-year information for 
comparable buildings. The Regional Office will provide the current year 
rate for the building in question.

accordance with all applicable statutes, regulations and policies. 
Specifically, under the Rural Development Act of 1972, as amended, 42 
U.S.C. Sec. 3122, agencies are required to give first priority to the 
location of new offices and other facilities in rural areas. When agency 
mission and program requirements call for location in an urban area, 
agencies must comply with Executive Order 12072, August 16, 1978, 3 CFR 
213 (1979), which requires that first consideration be given to central 
business areas (CBAs) and other designated areas. The agency shall 
submit to GSA a written statement explaining the basis for the 
delineated area.
    (b) GSA shall survey agencies' mission, housing, and location 
requirements in a community and include these considerations in 
community-based policies and plans. These plans shall provide for the 
location of federally-owned and leased facilities, and other interests 
in real property including purchases, at locations which represent the 
best overall value to the Government consistent with agency 
requirements.
    (c) Whenever practicable and cost-effective, GSA will consolidate 
elements of the same agency or multiple agencies in order to achieve the 
economic and programmatic benefits of consolidation.
    (d)(1) GSA will consult with local officials and other appropriate 
Government officials and consider their recommendations for, and review 
of, general areas of possible space or site acquisition. GSA will advise 
local officials of the availability of data on GSA plans and programs, 
and will agree upon the exchange of planning information with local 
officials. GSA will consult with local officials to identify CBAs.
    (2) With respect to an agency's request for space in an urban area, 
GSA shall provide appropriate Federal, State, regional, and local 
officials such notice as will keep them reasonably informed about GSA's 
proposed space action. For all proposed space actions with delineated 
areas either partially or wholly outside the CBA, GSA shall consult with 
such officials by providing them with written notice, by affording them 
a proper opportunity to respond, and by considering all recommendations 
for and objections to the proposed space action. All contacts with such 
officials relating to proposed space actions must be appropriately 
documented in the official procurement file.
    (e) GSA is responsible for reviewing an agency's delineated area to 
confirm that, where appropriate, there is maximum use of existing 
Government-controlled space and that established boundaries provide 
competition when acquiring leased space.
    (f) In satisfying agency requirements in an urban area, GSA will 
review an agency requested delineated area to ensure that the area is 
within the CBA. If the delineated area requested is outside the CBA, in 
whole or part, an agency must provide written justification to GSA 
setting forth facts and considerations sufficient to demonstrate that 
first consideration has been given to the CBA and to support the 
determination that the agency program function(s) involved cannot be 
efficiently performed within the CBA.
    (g) Agency justifications for locating outside CBAs must address, at 
a minimum, the efficient performance of the missions and programs of the 
agencies, the nature and function of the facilities involved, the 
convenience of the public served, and the maintenance and improvement of 
safe and healthful working conditions for employees.
    (h) GSA is responsible for approving the final delineated area. As 
the procuring agency, GSA must conduct all acquisitions in accordance 
with the requirements of all applicable laws, regulations, and Executive 
orders. GSA will review the identified delineated area to confirm its 
compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and Executive orders, 
including the Rural Development Act of 1972, as amended, the Competition 
in Contracting Act, as amended, 41 U.S.C. Secs. 252-266, and Executive 
Order 12072.
    (i) Executive Order 12072 provides that ``space assignments shall 
take into account the management needs for consolidation of agencies or 
activities in common or adjacent space in order to improve 
administration and management and effect economies.'' Justifications 
that rely on consolidation or adjacency requirements will be carefully 
reviewed for legitimacy.
    (j) Executive Order 12072 directs the Administrator of General 
Services to ``[e]nsure, in cooperation with the heads of Executive 
agencies, that their essential space requirements are met in a manner 
that is economically feasible and prudent.'' Justifications that rely on 
budget or other fiscal restraints for locating outside the CBA will be 
carefully reviewed for legitimacy.
    (k) Justifications based on executive or personnel preferences or 
other matters which do not have a material and significant adverse 
impact on the efficient performance of agency program functions are not 
acceptable.
    (l) In accordance with the Competition in Contracting Act, GSA may 
consider whether restricting the delineated area to the CBA will provide 
for competition when acquiring leased space. Where it is determined that 
an acquisition should not be restricted to the CBA, GSA may expand the 
delineated area in consultation with the requesting agency and local 
officials. The CBA must continue to be included in such an expanded 
area.
    (m) If, based on its review of an agency's requested delineated 
area, GSA concludes

[[Page 265]]

that changes are appropriate, GSA will discuss its recommended changes 
with the requesting agency. If after discussions the requesting agency 
does not agree with GSA's delineated area recommendation, the agency may 
take the steps described below. If an agency elects to request a review 
of the GSA's delineated area recommendation, GSA will continue to work 
on the requirements development and other activities related to the 
requesting agency's space request. GSA will not issue a solicitation to 
satisfy an agency's space request until all requested reviews have been 
resolved.
    (1) For space actions of less than 25,000 square feet, an agency may 
request a review of GSA's delineated area recommendation by submitting a 
written request to the responsible Assistant Regional Administrator for 
the Public Buildings Service. The request for review must state all 
facts and other considerations and must justify the requesting agency's 
proposed delineated area in light of Executive Order 12072 and other 
applicable statutes, regulations, and policies. The Assistant Regional 
Administrator will issue a decision within fifteen (15) working days. 
The decision of the Assistant Regional Administrator will be final and 
conclusive.
    (2) For space actions of 25,000 square feet or greater, a requesting 
agency may request a review of GSA's delineated area recommendation by 
submitting a written request to the Commissioner of the Public Buildings 
Service that the matter be referred to an interagency council for 
decision. The interagency council will be established specifically to 
consider the appeal and will be comprised of the Administrator of 
General Services or his/her designee, the Secretary of Housing and Urban 
Development, or his/her designee, and such other Federal official(s) as 
the Administrator may appoint.
    (n) The presence of the Federal Government in the National Capital 
Region (NCR) is such that the distribution of Federal installations will 
continue to be a major influence in the extent and character of 
development. These policies shall be applied in the GSA National Capital 
Region, in conjunction with regional policies established by the 
National Capital Planning Commission and consistent with the general 
purposes of the National Capital Planning Act of 1959 (66 Stat. 781), as 
amended. These policies shall guide the development of strategic plans 
for the housing of Federal agencies within the National Capital Region.
    (o) Consistent with the policies cited in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) 
and (e) above, the use of buildings of historic architectural, or 
cultural significance within the meaning of section 105 of the Public 
Buildings Cooperative Use Act of 1976 (90 Stat. 2505) will be considered 
as alternative sources for meeting Federal space needs.
    (p) As used in Sec. 101-17.205, the following terms have the 
following meanings:
    (1) ``CBA'' means the centralized community business area and 
adjacent areas of similar character, including other specific areas 
which may be recommended by local officials in accordance with Executive 
order 12072.
    (2) ``Delineated area'' means the specific boundaries within which 
space will be obtained to satisfy an agency space requirement.
    (3) ``Rural area'' means any area that (i) is within a city or town 
if the city or town has a population of less than 10,000 or (ii) is not 
within the outer boundaries of a city or town if the city or town has a 
population of 50,000 or more and if the adjacent urbanized and 
urbanizing areas have a population density of more than 100 per square 
mile.
    (4) ``Urban area'' means any Metropolitan Area (MA) as defined by 
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and any non-MA that meets one 
of the following criteria:
    (i) A geographical area within the jurisdiction of any incorporated 
city, town, borough, village, or other unit of general local government, 
except county or parish, having a population of 10,000 or more 
inhabitants.
    (ii) That portion of the geographical area within the jurisdiction 
of any county, town, township, or similar governmental entity which 
contains no incorporated unit of general local government, but has a 
population density equal to or exceeding 1,500 inhabitants per square 
mile; or
    (iii) That portion of any geographical area having a population 
density equal to or exceeding 1,500 inhabitants per square mile and 
situated adjacent to the boundary of any incorporated unit of general 
local government which has a population of 10,000 or more inhabitants.

<R05>
Sec. 101-25.100  Use of Government personal property and nonpersonal services.

    Except in emergencies, Government personal property and nonpersonal 
services shall be used only for those purposes for which they were 
obtained or contracted for or other officially designated purposes. 
Emergency conditions are those threatening loss of life and property. As 
used in this section nonpersonal services means those contractual 
services, other than personal and professional services (as defined in 
40 U.S.C. 472). This includes property and services on interagency loan 
as well as property leased by agencies. Agency heads shall ensure that 
the provisions of this Sec. 101-25.100 are enforced to restrict the use 
of Government property/services to officially designated activities.
[40 FR 29818, July 16, 1975]


<R05>
Sec. 101-25.101  Criteria for determining method of supply.


<R05>
Sec. 101-25.101-1  General.

    (a) This Sec. 101-25.101 prescribes general criteria governing 
selection of the appropriate methods of supply to be utilized in meeting 
the planned requirements of the Government. It is directly applicable to 
executive agencies, and other Federal agencies are requested to observe 
these criteria in conducting their supply operations.
    (b) As used in this Sec. 101-25.101, the term use point means a 
storeroom or other redistribution point where supplies, materials, or 
equipment representing more than a 30-day supply are maintained 
primarily for issue directly to consumers within the local area, as 
distinguished from storage points where supplies and equipment are 
issued to redistribution points.


<R05>
Sec. 101-25.101-2  Supply through storage and issue.

    The following criteria shall govern in determining whether an item 
can be most advantageously supplied through storage and issue to use 
points:
    (a) The item shall be physically adaptable to storage and issue and 
of such a character that it is feasible to forecast overall requirements 
of the use points served with reasonable accuracy;
    (b) Rate of use and frequency of ordering at use points shall be 
sufficient to warrant storage and issue;
    (c) The rate of deterioration or obsolescence shall be sufficiently 
low to avoid unnecessary loss; and
    (d) Conditions exist where any of the following factors require 
supply through storage and issue (except that dangerous commodities of 
high weight and density, or commodities highly susceptible to damage 
normally should not be considered for supply through storage and issue 
unless one or more of such factors are determined to be of overriding 
importance)--
    (1) Where price advantage through bulk buying is sufficient to 
render storage and issue more economical, all costs, both direct and 
indirect, considered.
    (2) Where close inspection or testing is necessary to secure 
quality, or where repetitive inspection and test of small lots are 
prohibitive from the standpoint of cost or potential urgency of need.
    (3) Where advance purchase and storage are necessitated by long 
procurement leadtime.

[[Page 268]]

    (4) Where an item is of special manufacture or design and is not 
readily available from commercial sources.
    (5) Where an adequate industry distribution system does not exist to 
assure availability at use point.
    (6) Where volume purchases are necessary to secure timely deliveries 
and advantageous prices.
    (7) Where market conditions are such that supply through storage and 
issue is required to assure adequate supply.
    (8) Where stocking of supplies and equipment necessary for 
implementation of emergency plans is required for an indefinite period.


<R05>
Sec. 101-25.101-3  Supply through consolidated purchase for direct delivery to use points.

    The following criteria shall govern in determining whether an item 
can be most advantageously supplied through consolidated purchase for 
direct delivery to use points:
    (a) The items shall be equipment or supply items of such a character 
that it is feasible to forecast requirements for delivery to specific 
use points; and
    (b) Conditions exist where any of the following factors requires 
consolidated purchasing of such items for direct delivery to use 
points--
    (1) Where greatest price advantage, both direct and indirect costs 
considered, is obtainable through large definite quantity purchasing.
    (2) Where an item is of special manufacture or design and is not 
readily available from commercial sources.
    (3) Where market conditions are such that central procurement is 
required to assure adequate supply.
    (4) Where contracts for production quantities are necessary to 
secure timely deliveries and advantageous prices.
    (5) Where the quantity is large enough to assure lowest 
transportation costs or, conversely, where transportation costs for 
small quantity redistribution are so excessive that it is not feasible 
to store and issue the items.


<R05>
Sec. 101-25.101-4  Supply through indefinite quantity requirement contracts.

    The following criteria shall govern in determining whether an item 
can be most advantageously supplied through the medium of indefinite 
quantity requirement contracts covering specific periods and providing 
for delivery to use points as needs arise:
    (a) The item shall be such a character that--
    (1) Handling on a storage and issue basis is not economically sound, 
under the criteria prescribed in Sec. 101-25.101-2;
    (2) Rate of use and frequency of ordering at use points is estimated 
to be sufficient to warrant the making of indefinite quantity 
requirement contracts;
    (3) It is either not feasible to forecast definite requirements for 
delivery to specific use points (as in the case of new items initially 
being introduced into a supply system), or no advantage accrues doing 
so; and
    (b) Industry distribution facilities are adequate properly to serve 
the use points involved; and
    (c) Conditions exist where any of the following factors requires the 
maintaining of indefinite quantity requirements contracts--
    (1) Advantage to the Government is greater than would be secured by 
definite quantity procurements by individual offices or agencies (the 
determining consideration being one of overall economy to the 
Government, rather than one of direct comparison of unit prices of 
individual items obtainable through other methods of supply); or no 
known procurement economies would be effected but the requirements of 
offices of agencies can best be served by indefinite quantity 
requirements contracts.
    (2) Acute competitive bidding problems exist because of highly 
technical matters which can best be met on a centralized contracting 
basis.
    (3) The item is proprietary or so complex in design, function, or 
operation as to be noncompetitive and procurement can best be performed 
on a centralized contracting basis.


<R05>
Sec. 101-25.101-5  Supply through local purchase.

    The following criteria shall govern in determining whether an item 
should be supplied through local purchase:
    (a) Urgency of need requires local purchase to assure prompt 
delivery;

[[Page 269]]

    (b) The items are perishable or subject to rapid deterioration which 
will not permit delay incident to shipment from distant points;
    (c) The local purchase is within applicable limitation established 
by the agency head; or
    (d) Local purchase will produce the greatest economy to the 
Government.


<R05>
Sec. 101-25.102  Exchange or sale of personal property for replacement purposes.

    Policies and methods governing executive agencies in exercising the 
authority granted under section 201(c) of the Federal Property and 
Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended (40 U.S.C. 481(c)), are 
prescribed in part 101-46.
[31 FR 4997, Mar. 26, 1966]


<R05>
Sec. 101-25.103  Promotional materials, trading stamps, or bonus goods.


<R05>
Sec. 101-25.103-1  General.

    Federal agencies in a position to receive promotional materials, 
trading stamps, or bonus goods shall establish internal procedures for 
the receipt and disposition of these gratuities in accordance with 
Sec. 101-25.103. The procedures shall provide for a minimum of 
administrative and accounting controls.
[48 FR 48232, Oct. 18, 1983]


<R05>
Sec. 101-25.103-2  Promotional material received in conjunction with official travel from transportation companies, rental car companies, or other commercial 
          activities.

    (a) All promotional materials (e.g., bonus flights, reduced-fare 
coupons, cash, merchandise, gifts, credits toward future free or reduced 
costs of services or goods, etc.) received by employees in conjunction 
with official travel and based on the purchase of a ticket or other 
services (e.g. car rental) are properly considered to be due the 
Government and may not be retained by the employee. The Comptroller 
General of the United States has stated that employees are obligated to 
account for any gift, gratuity, or benefit received from private sources 
incident to the performance of official duties (see Comp. Gen. Decision 
B-199656, July 15, 1981). When an employee receives promotional 
material, the employee shall accept the material on behalf of the United 
States and relinquish it to an appropriate agency official.
    (b) Promotional coupons that provide for future free or reduced 
costs of services (travel) should be integrated into the agency travel 
plans to maximize the benefits to the Government. The coupons should 
then be applied to the maximum extent possible; e.g., coast-to-coast or 
overseas travel, if permitted.
    (c) Promotional coupons that carry a cash surrender value shall be 
redeemed immediately. The cash received from redeemed coupons or other 
cash compensation (i.e., denied boarding or cancellation of reservation 
by carriers, etc.) shall be deposited in accordance with Department of 
Treasury requirements, and credited to miscellaneous receipt account 
1699, ``Miscellaneous Dividends and Earnings, Not Otherwise 
Classified.''
    (d) Promotional materials that cannot be used by the receiving 
agency shall be disposed of in accordance with Sec. 101-25.103-4.
[48 FR 48232, Oct. 18, 1983]


<R05>
Sec. 101-25.103-3  Trading stamps or bonus goods received from contractors.

    When contracts contain a price reduction clause, any method (such as 
trading stamps or bonus goods) by which the price of a commodity or 
service is effectively reduced shall constitute a price reduction. 
Temporary or promotional price reductions are to be made available to 
contracting officers under the same terms and conditions as to other 
customers. Procuring activities, however, rather than accept trading 
stamps and bonus goods, shall attempt to deduct the cost of such items 
from the contract price. If obtaining such a price reduction is not 
possible, the contracting officer shall document the contract file to 
that effect and dispose of the items as provided in Sec. 101-25.103.4.
[48 FR 48232, Oct. 18, 1983]

[[Page 270]]


<R05>
Sec. 101-25.103-4  Disposition of promotional materials, trading stamps, or bonus goods.

    (a) Agencies shall, through the lowest appropriate activity, arrange 
for transfer of promotional materials, trading stamps, or bonus goods, 
without reimbursement in accordance with internal agency procedures to a 
nearby Federal hospital or similar institution operated, managed, or 
supervised by the Department of Defense (DOD) or the Veterans 
Administration (VA) when:
    (1) The contract does not contain a price reduction clause, or
    (2) The contractor refuses to grant a price reduction, and
    (3) It is deemed practical and in the best interest of the 
Government to accept such promotional items as a price reduction, and
    (4) The procuring or receiving agency has no practical use for the 
promotional items.
    (b) Before transferring promotional materials, trading stamps, or 
bonus goods to the above Federal institutions, it must be determined 
that the proposed recipient is prepared to receive and use such items. 
If these items cannot be used by the receiving agency or a medical 
facility, they should be disposed of in accordance with 41 CFR 101-43, 
44 and 45.
[48 FR 48232, Oct. 18, 1983]


<R05>
Sec. 101-25.104  Acquisition of office furniture and office machines.

    Each executive agency shall make a determination as to whether the 
requirements of the agency can be met through the utilization of already 
owned items prior to the acquisition of new furniture or office 
machines. The acquisition of new items shall be limited to those 
requirements which are considered absolutely essential and shall not 
include upgrading to improve appearance, office decor, or status, or to 
satisfy the desire for the latest design or more expensive lines.
    (a) Generally acquisition of additional furniture or office machines 
from any source will be authorized only under the following 
circumstances, limited to the least expensive lines which will meet the 
requirement (see Sec. 101-26.408 of this chapter with respect to items 
such as typewriters under Federal Supply Schedule contracts), and the 
justification for the action shall be fully documented in the agency 
file:
    (1) For essential requirements arising from quantitative increases 
in onboard employment which constitute the total requirement of any 
agency or major component thereof (e.g. bureau, service, office).
    (2) For essential requirements arising from a need not related to 
onboard employment increases but which are determined necessary to avoid 
impairment of program efficiency.
    (b) Each agency shall restrict replacement of furniture or office 
machines either to usable excess, rehabilitated, or the least expensive 
new lines available which will meet the requirement under the following 
circumstances, authority for which will meet the requirement under the 
following circumstances, authority for which shall be fully documented 
in the agency file:
    (1) Where the agency determines that the item is not economically 
repairable.
    (2) Where reductions in office space occupancy are accomplished 
through use of more convenient or smaller size furniture and the space 
economies thus achieved offset the cost of the furniture to be acquired.

Sec. 101-25.107  Guidelines for requisitioning and proper use of consumable or low cost items.

    Consumable and low value items in inventory (cupboard stocks are not 
considered inventory) are subject to accounting and inventory record 
controls in accordance with applicable provisions of law and the 
principles and standards prescribed by the General Accounting Office, 2 
GAO 12.5. Normally, however, the systems of control for such property 
cease at the time of issuance from a warehouse or storeroom to the 
consumer.
    (a) The guidelines set forth in this Sec. 101-25.107 are considered 
minimum to assure proper use of consumable or low cost items by 
individuals, subsequent to issue from accountable records and 
termination of formal accountability. Consumable items, for the purpose 
of this section, are considered to include those items actually consumed 
in use (e.g., pads and pencils) and those items required in performance 
of duties but for which, primarily by reason of the low value involved, 
no formal accountability is maintained after issue, and are generally 
referred to as ``expendable.''
    (b) Approval of requisitions for replenishment of cupboard storeroom 
stocks should be restricted to officials at a responsible supervisory 
level to ensure that supply requirements are justified on the basis of 
essentiality and quantity. Where requisitions are not required, such as 
in obtaining items from GSA customer supply centers, informal ``shopping 
lists'' should be approved at the same level.
    (c) Adequate safeguards and controls should be established to assure 
that issues of expendable supplies are made for official use only. In 
appropriate situations, this will include identification of individuals 
to whom expendable supplies have been issued. Experience has indicated, 
also, that certain items of expendables should not be displayed either 
at seasonal periods of the year or on a permanent basis.
    (d) The items listed below have from experience proven to be 
personally attractive and particularly susceptible to being used for 
other than official duties. Agencies should give special attention to 
these and any other consumable or low cost items when issues are 
excessive when compared with normal program needs.

Attache cases, Ball point pens and refills, Brief cases, Binders, Carbon 
paper, Dictionaries, Felt tip markers, Felt tip pens and refills, File 
folders, Letterex, Letter openers, Pads (paper), Paper clips, Pencils, 
Pencil sharpeners, Portfolios (leather, plastic, and writing pads), 
Rubber bands, Rulers, Scissors, Spray paint and lacquer, Staplers, 
Staples, Staple removers, Tape dispensers, Transparent tape, Typewriter 
ribbons.

Sec. 101-25.108  Multiyear subscriptions for publications.

    Subscriptions for periodicals, newspapers, and other publications 
for which it is known in advance that a continuing requirement exists 
should be for multiple years rather than for a single year where such 
method is advantageous for the purpose of economy or otherwise. Where 
various bureaus or offices in the same agency are subscribing to the 
same publication, consideration shall be given to consolidating these 
requirements, to the extent practical, on an agency-wide basis and on a 
multiyear basis. Payment covering issues to be delivered during the 
entire subscription period may be made in advance from currently 
available appropriations (31 U.S.C. 530a).

Agencies may establish such additional controls as are appropriate to 
increase the use of already-owned equipment instead of procuring similar 
equipment.
    (b) The term Federal laboratory, as used in this section, means any 
laboratory or laboratory facility in any Government-owned or -leased 
building which is equipped and/or used for scientific research, testing, 
or analysis, except clinical laboratories operating in direct support of 
Federal health care programs. To the extent practicable, agencies should

    (a) The provisions of this Sec. 101-25.109-1 apply to all Federal 
laboratories regardless of size.
    (b) Inspection tours of Federal laboratories shall be conducted on a 
scheduled basis, annually, if feasible, but no less than every 2 years, 
for the purpose of identifying idle and unneeded laboratory and research 
equipment. Following each tour, a report of findings shall be prepared 
by the inspection team and, as determined by the agency head or his 
designee, submitted to the head of the laboratory or to a higher agency 
official having laboratories management responsibility. Equipment 
identified by the inspection team as idle or unneeded shall be 
reassigned as needed within the laboratory, placed in an equipment pool, 
or declared excess and made available to other agencies in accordance 
with part 101-43.
    (c) Laboratory inspection teams shall be comprised of senior program 
management, property management, and scientific personnel who are 
familiar with the plans and programs of the laboratory(ies) and who have 
a knowledge of laboratory and research equipment utilization. As 
determined by the agency head or his designee, members of an inspection 
team shall be appointed by either the head of the laboratory or a higher 
agency official having laboratories management responsibility.
    (d) The agency head or his designee shall ensure compliance by 
responsible personnel with the requirements of this Sec. 101-25.109-1 
and shall require that periodic independent reviews of walk-through 
procedures employed in Federal laboratories under his control be 
conducted to determine their effectiveness and to effect modifications 
as appropriate.

Sec. 101-25.109-2  Equipment pools.

    (a) The provisions of this Sec. 101-25.109-2 apply to Federal 
laboratories which occupy an area of 10,000 square feet or more and 
employ 25 or more technical or scientific personnel.
    (b) Equipment pools shall be established in Federal laboratories so 
that laboratory and research equipment can be shared or allocated on a 
temporary basis to laboratory activities and individuals whose average 
use does not warrant the assignment of the equipment on a permanent 
basis. In determining the number and location of equipment pools, 
consideration shall be given to economy of operation, mobility of 
equipment, accessibility to users,

[[Page 273]]

frequency of use of the equipment, and impact on research programs. 
Pooling operations should begin expeditiously, within 120 days, if 
feasible, following decisions regarding the number and location of 
pools. If it is determined that an equipment pool would not be practical 
or economical or for any other reason is not needed at a particular 
laboratory, a written report supporting that determination shall be 
submitted to the agency head or his designee. Federal laboratories which 
do not meet the size and staffing criteria in Sec. 101-25.109-2(a) 
should also establish equipment pools whenever feasible; however, these 
facilities need not submit written reports regarding determinations not 
to establish pools.
    (c) Where the establishment of a physical pool would be economically 
unfeasible due to excessive transportation and handling costs, limited 
personnel resources, or limited space, pooling may be accomplished by 
means of equipment listings. Consideration should be given to the 
establishment of a laboratory advisory committee consisting of technical 
and management personnel to determine the types of equipment to be 
shared or pooled and to identify equipment that is no longer required.
    (1) Equipment pools may also be used to fill requests for temporary 
replacements while permanently assigned equipment is being repaired or 
to provide equipment for new laboratories pending acquisition of 
permanent equipment.
    (2) Although specific pieces of laboratory equipment may not be 
available for assignment to equipment pools, they may be available for 
sharing or loan. Information concerning the availability of this 
equipment can be maintained at a central location such as the equipment 
pools.
    (d) Unless determined unnecessary by the agency head or his 
designee, each Federal laboratory operating equipment pools shall 
prepare and submit to the agency head or his designee an annual report 
concerning the use and effectiveness of equipment pooling.
    (e) The agency head or his designee shall ensure compliance by 
responsible personnel with the provisions of this Sec. 101-25.109-2 and 
shall require that periodic independent reviews of equipment pool 
operations in Federal laboratories under his control be conducted to 
determine their effectiveness and to effect modifications as 
appropriate.

Sec. 101-25.111  Environmental impact policy.

    (a) From time to time, Congress enacts legislation pertaining to the 
protection and enhancement of the Nation's environment; e.g., the 
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321). The 
objective of such legislation is, among other things, the improvement of 
the relationship between people and their environment and the lessening 
of hazards affecting their health and safety. It is the policy of the 
General Services Administration to appropriately implement the various 
provisions of these Acts of Congress as fully as statutory authority 
permits in support of the national policy.
    (b) With respect to the procurement, management, and disposal of 
personal property, the implementation of national environmental policy 
is provided through amendments to the regulations of GSA, changes to 
Federal specifications and standards documents, as appropriate, and 
other actions as may be required when expediency is of prime importance. 
Further, the Federal regulatory agencies have imposed restrictions 
applicable to the procurement, use, and disposal of items supplied 
through the Federal supply system that are known to contain components 
or possess qualities that have an adverse impact on the environment or 
that result in creating unsafe or unhealthy working conditions. Each 
agency, therefore, shall take action as necessary to ensure that the 
objectives and directives of the National Environmental Policy Act, 
other environmental statutes, and applicable regulations are met; 
especially the directive that environmental concerns, effects, and 
values shall be given appropriate consideration with economic and 
technical issues in decisionmaking. Action should include a continuing 
review of the Federal Register and issuances promulgated by the Federal 
regulatory agencies for guidance applicable to the procurement, use, and 
disposal of items that are known to contain components or to possess 
qualities that have an adverse impact on the environment or that result 
in creating unsafe or unhealthy working conditions.

Sec. 101-25.203  Centralized purchases by GSA.

    GSA will exclusively, or with specified limited exceptions, make 
purchases and contracts on a continuing

[[Page 276]]

basis for articles and services for the executive branch of the 
Government in the interest of lower prices, improved quality, and 
service or standardization when:
    (a) The item or item groups of articles and services are items of 
``common-use'' which are defined as items of standard commercial 
production or items covered by Federal Specifications commonly used by 
both civilian and military activities, or by two or more civilian 
activities, and not requiring such substantial alterations to adapt them 
to military or other particular application as to render inclusion in a 
centralized purchasing program impracticable; or
    (b) A number of agencies, representing the majority users according 
to dollar volume, request GSA to make purchases and contracts 
exclusively for a given item or item groups of articles and services 
even though not ``common-use'' items as defined in Sec. 101-25.203(a); 
and
    (c) GSA is best equipped to do the buying based upon the factors

and 101-25.204.
    (e) GSA has issued appropriate regulations, or a Federal Supply 
Schedule, specifically designating the item or item groups of articles 
or services that fall within paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this 
Sec. 101-25.203 that are thereafter to be purchased exclusively for all 
executive agencies, or with specified limited exceptions, by GSA.


<R05>
Sec. 101-25.204  Centralized purchases by designated executive agencies under authority delegated by the Administrator of General Services.

    Designated executive agencies will exclusively, or with specified 
limited exceptions, make purchases and contracts on a continuing basis 
for items or item groups of articles and services for the executive 
branch of the Government in the interest of lower prices, improved 
quality, and service or standardization when:
    (a) The Administrator of General Services has determined, based upon 
the factors listed in Sec. 101-25.202, that a selected executive agency 
is best equipped to perform certain purchasing and contracting 
functions, and the Administrator of General Services has issued 
appropriate regulations designating the categories of articles or

    (b) The head of the designated executive agency has issued 
appropriate instructions, or a Federal Supply Schedule, under authority 
as delegated by and in the form approved by the Administrator, 
specifically designating the item or item groups of articles or services 
that are thereafter to be purchased exclusively for all executive 
agencies, or with specified limited exceptions, by the designated 
executive agency.


<R05>
Sec. 101-25.205  Arrangement for performance of purchasing functions other than centralized.

    (a) Upon request, GSA will make purchases and contracts for any of 
the items or item groups of articles or services authorized to be 
purchased independently by executive agencies. GSA will also arrange, on 
a basis mutually agreeable, with any executive agency to perform its 
purchase and contracting functions on a continuing basis, if requested 
in writing to do so by the agency head, provided the arrangements agreed 
upon will result in

[[Page 277]]

lowered cost or improved service either to the individual agency or to 
the Government as a whole.
    (b) In those instances where lowered cost or improved service, 
either to an individual agency or to the Government as a whole will 
result, GSA will arrange, on a basis mutually agreeable to the agencies 
involved, to assign all or a portion of the purchase and contracting 
functions of one executive agency to another executive agency on a 
continuing basis.


<R05>
Sec. 101-25.206  Independent purchases by executive agencies.

    Items or groups of items of articles or services may be purchased

mandatory Federal Supply Schedules, issued by GSA or by another 
executive agency designated by the Administrator of General Services.
    (b) For emergency requirements when time does not permit purchasing 
through the authorized central purchasing agency. A record shall be 
maintained of such transactions and be made available to the responsible 
central purchasing agency upon request.
    (c) By consultation between GSA and agencies concerned, it is 
determined that interagency purchase assignment would adversely affect 
the national security or military operations.
    (d) The purchases cannot be publicly disclosed in the interest of 
national security.

Sec. 101-25.302-2  Filing cabinets.

    Executive agencies shall make every effort to effect maximum use of 
filing cabinets and to limit the purchase of new equipment. Filing 
cabinets should be replaced only in accordance with the standards in 
subpart 101-25.4. Maximum utilization of equipment should be obtained 
by:
    (a) Disposing of all records that have been authorized for 
disposition by the Congress or, where such authorization

[[Page 278]]

has not been obtained, through the preparation and obtaining of 
authorized disposal schedules with the assistance of the National 
Archives and Records Administration.
    (b) Removing office supplies, publications, and other nonrecord 
material from filing cabinets to more suitable storage equipment, except 
where the quantity of such material is small (as a rule, less than half 
a cabinet).
    (c) Transferring to Federal Records Centers or approved agency 
records centers (to the extent that facilities are made available) 
inactive records not needed in daily business but not yet ready for 
disposal, when filing equipment can be released by such action.
    (d) Shifting less active files, not transferable to approved records 
centers, to fiberboard storage boxes, using filing cabinets only when 
files are constantly used.

on prices as shown in the current edition of the GSA Supply Catalog, 
applicable Federal Supply Schedules, or the lowest available market 
price). An exception is authorized in those unusual situations in which 
rehabilitation of the furniture at 75 percent or less of the cost of a 
new item would not extend its useful life for a period compatible with 
the cost of rehabilitation as determined by the agency head or his 
designee.

Sec. 101-25.405  Materials handling equipment.

    (a) Materials handling equipment will not be replaced unless the 
estimated cost of necessary one-time repair or reconditioning of each 
piece of equipment exceeds, at lowest available cost, the applicable 
percentage of acquisition cost as shown in column 3 of the following 
table. Equipment eligible for replacement under the criteria established 
by this standard may be repaired provided the expected economical life 
is extended commensurate with the expenditure required. Prior to 
incurring repair costs for equipment eligible for replacement, 
consideration should be given to the continuing availability of repair 
parts.
    (1) Years in use shall be determined in accordance with the 
following:
    (i) An operating month is considered equal to 100 operating hours. 
For materials handling equipment in storage, one month in storage equals 
50 hours of operation.
    (ii) The number of years in use is determined by dividing the number 
of operating months by 12. The fractional years in use resulting from 
this computation will be rounded to the nearest full year.

    (2) In using the maximum allowable one-time repair limits in column 
3 of the table, costs such as parts, labor, and transportation incident 
to the repairs, are to be included in computing one-time repair costs. 
However, operating expenses such as fuels and lubricants, replacement 
tires and batteries, and antifreeze will not be included in the one-time 
repair cost estimate.
    (b) Notwithstanding the limitations prescribed in Sec. 101-
25.405(a), materials handling equipment may be replaced under the 
following conditions provided a written justification supporting such 
replacement is approved by the agency head or an authorized designee. 
The justification shall be retained in the agency files.
    (1) When the cumulative repair costs on a piece of equipment appears 
to be

[[Page 280]]

excessive as indicated by repair records. However, because an item of 
equipment accrues repair costs equal to the acquisition cost, it is not 
necessarily indicative of the current condition of the equipment. For 
example, a substantial repair expenditure included in the cumulative 
cost may actually have resulted in restoring the equipment to as good as 
new condition. While cumulative repair costs suggest an area for 
investigation, they should not be used as the principal ingredient in 
the repair/replacement decision making process.
    (2) When repair parts are not available causing excessive equipment 
out-of-service time.
    (3) When the equipment lacks essential features required in a 
particular task which is of a continuing nature and other suitable 
equipment is not readily available.

Subpart 101-25.5--Guidelines for Making Purchase or Lease Determinations

    Source: 31 FR 3462, Mar. 5, 1966, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 101-25.500  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart prescribes guidelines to be used by executive agencies 
in determining whether acquisition of equipment of the types specified 
in this subpart should be by purchase or lease. If appropriate, 
executive agencies should use these guidelines in the determination, 
allowance, or evaluation of costs under the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation (FAR) (48 CFR part 31) to the extent that the guidelines are 
consistent therewith.
[53 FR 11848, Apr. 11, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 101-25.501  General.

    Studies conducted by the Federal Government indicate that in many 
cases substantial savings can be realized through purchasing rather than 
leasing certain equipment. These studies emphasize the need for making 
cost comparisons prior to determining method of acquisition.


<R05>
Sec. 101-25.501-1  Acquisition considerations.

    (a) Prior to acquisition of the types of equipment specified in this 
subpart (and to other types as appropriate) consideration shall be given 
to:
    (1) Length of time the equipment is to be used, including extent of 
usage, e.g., three shifts for 2 years, and including potential 
additional use by another Federal agency if the equipment becomes excess 
to the acquiring agency;
    (2) Financial and other advantages of all types and makes available;
    (3) Leasing costs and purchase options;
    (4) Costs of purchase and installation;
    (5) Imminent technological improvements; and
    (6) Other pertinent factors.
    (b) Where an agency already has leased equipment in its possession, 
consideration shall be given to the feasibility of purchasing such 
equipment or new equipment of a similar or different type and make.


<R05>
Sec. 101-25.501-2  Cost comparison methods.

    (a) Different methods may be used for projecting pertinent factors 
into a cost comparison of alternative methods of acquisition. These 
range from highly technical methods which include the consideration of 
factors such as interest rates, technological life, and trade-in or 
salvage value to a basic method which simply compares the cost of 
purchasing and maintaining equipment against the cumulative costs of 
leasing. Irrespective of the method used for cost comparison, the point 
in time at which cumulative leasing costs exceed purchase costs for 
specific types of equipment usually does not vary significantly.
    (b) A simplified method of making a comparative cost analysis of the 
alternative methods of acquisition is illustrated for each type of 
equipment for which purchase or lease guidelines and criteria are 
established in this subpart 101-25.5.

[[Page 281]]


<R05>
Sec. 101-25.501-3  Reviewing application of guidelines.

    (a) The acquiring agency has the primary responsibility for 
appropriate application of the guidelines established in this subpart 
101-25.5. However, GSA will review data relating to equipment 
acquisitions involving purchase or lease determinations through a 
sampling of these transactions as GSA conducts supply management surveys 
and/or reviews as provided in Sec. 101-25.114.
    (b) Copies of cost comparisons and any other pertinent data used to 
support decisions to lease or purchase equipment shall be retained in 
the acquiring agency's case file.
[31 FR 3462, Mar. 5, 1966, as amended at 45 FR 41948, June 23, 1980]


<R05>
Sec. 101-25.502  Methods of acquisition.

    (a) The determination as to whether equipment is to be acquired by 
purchase or lease shall be made in each case only after comparison of 
the relative costs of the equipment through use of the methods shown in 
this Sec. 101-25.502. Cost comparisons shall include those elements 
affecting the acquisition cost of the specific types of equipment set 
forth in this subpart 101-25.5. The method selected shall be that which 
offers the greatest advantage to the Government under the circumstances 
applying to each situation, cost and other factors considered.
    (b) Upon request, GSA will assist agencies in making appropriate 
determinations to lease or purchase equipment by providing the latest 
information on pending price adjustments to Federal Supply Schedule 
contracts and other factors such as recent or imminent technological 
developments, new techniques, and industry or market trends. Inquiries 
should be addressed to the General Services Administration (FC), 
Washington, DC 20406.
[31 FR 3462, Mar. 5, 1966, as amended at 53 FR 11848, Apr. 11, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 101-25.502-1  Purchase method.

    (a) A cost advantage can be obtained by the purchase method provided 
the equipment is used beyond the point in time at which the cumulative 
leasing costs exceed purchase costs. The purchase method shall be used 
when it has been established that the equipment under consideration can 
be used as provided in Secs. 101-25.502(a) and 101-25.502(b) beyond the 
point in time at which the purchase method begins to provide a cost 
advantage.
    (b) The acquisition of selected equipment by the purchase method 
should not be ruled out in favor of leasing such equipment merely 
because of the possibility that future technological improvements may 
render the selected equipment less desirable.


<R05>
Sec. 101-25.502-2  Lease method.

    (a) The lease with option to purchase method shall be used when it 
is necessary or advantageous to proceed with acquisition of the 
equipment that meets program or system requirements but it is determined 
that purchase should be deferred because circumstances do not fully 
satisfy the conditions set forth in Sec. 101-25.502-1.
    (b) The lease/buy cost comparison method described in OMB Circular 
A-104 is the preferred cost comparison method. Other methods (life-cycle 
cost, break even analysis, etc.) may be used in accordance with normal 
agency procedures. (Copies of OMB Circular A-104 may be obtained from 
the Executive Office of the President Publications Service, 725 17th 
Street, NW., room 2200, Washington, DC 20503.)
    (c) A reevaluaton of the cost advantage of the lease over the 
exercise of purchase option credits or purchase of new replacement 
equipment should be performed before the renewal of the equipment lease.

<R05>
Sec. 101-25.504  Office copying machines.

    (a) When selecting office copying machines, agencies shall take full 
advantage of any purchase options that may be available under the terms 
and conditions of the applicable Federal Supply Schedule contracts. 
Rental contracts provide for receiving credits, usually up to a certain 
specified limit, which may be applied towards the purchase price of the 
equipment being rented. Once the maximum credits have been accumulated, 
agencies should consider

[[Page 282]]

purchasing the equipment, because additional rental payments will not 
further reduce the option to purchase price.
    (b) Selection of the appropriate and most economical equipment for 
the application intended is the responsibility of the ordering agency. 
The selection process should include a review of the functional and 
financial advantages of all available copying processes (see Sec. 101-
26.408).
    (c) Before acquisition of equipment, a comparison shall be made of 
the relative costs of acquiring the equipment by use of the methods 
described in Sec. 101-25.502-1 and Sec. 101-25.502-2. The cost 
comparison shall be based on the best available information and 
estimates, including those factors in Sec. 101-25.502-1 and any other 
factors peculiar to office copying machines.

Sec. 101-26.000  Scope of part.

    This part prescribes policies and procedures which govern the 
procurement of personal property and nonpersonal services by Federal 
agencies from or through GSA supply sources as established by law or 
other competent authority. The specific subparts or sections covering 
the subject matter involved prescribe the extent to which the sources of 
supply are to be used by Government agencies. Certain civilian and 
military commissaries and nonappropriated fund activities are also 
eligible to use GSA supply sources for their own use, not for resale, 
unless otherwise authorized by the individual Federal agency and 
concurred in by GSA. Policy and procedures pertaining to purchasing of 
property or contracting for services from commercial sources, without 
recourse to established GSA supply sources, are provided in the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation (FAR) (48 CFR chapter 1).

<R04>
                        Subpart 101-26.1--General


<R05>
Sec. 101-26.100  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart provides policy guidance of a general nature concerning 
procurement of lowest cost items obtainable from GSA supply sources; 
availability from GSA of special buying services in addition to the 
specified GSA procurement sources; criteria for placing end-of-year 
purchase documents with GSA and for insuring that end-of-year 
requisitions placed with GSA obligate the applicable fiscal year 
appropriation; and justification requirements to support negotiated 
procurement by GSA for other agencies.
[36 FR 17423, Aug. 31, 1971]


<R05>
Sec. 101-26.100-1  Procurement of lowest cost items.

    GSA provides lines of similar items to meet particular end-use 
requirements under the GSA stock program, special order program (SOP) 
established source, and the Federal Supply Schedule program. Although 
these similar items may differ in terms of price, quality, and essential 
characteristics, they often can serve the same functional end-use 
procurement needs of the various ordering agencies. Therefore, in 
submitting requisitions or placing delivery orders for similar items 
obtainable from GSA sources, agencies shall utilize the source from 
which the lowest cost item can be obtained which will adequately serve 
the functional end-use purpose.
[56 FR 12455, Mar. 26, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 101-26.100-2  Request for waivers.

    Waiver requests, when required by Sec. 101-26.102-1 (special order 
program established source items), Sec. 101-26.301 (GSA stock items) or 
Sec. 101-26.401-3(b) (Federal Supply Schedule items), shall be submitted 
to the Commissioner, Federal Supply Service (F), General Services 
Administration, Washington, DC 20406. Waiver requests will be approved 
if considered justified. Approval of a waiver request does not 
constitute authority for a sole source procurement. Depending on the 
basis for the waiver request, each request shall contain the following 
information:
    (a) Waiver requests based on determination that the GSA item is not 
of the requisite quality or will not serve the required functional end-
use purpose of the agency requesting the waiver shall include the 
following information with each request:
    (1) A complete description of the type of item needed to satisfy the 
requirement. Descriptive literature such as cuts, illustrations, 
drawings, and brochures which show the characteristics or construction 
of the type of item or an explanation of the operation should be 
furnished whenever possible.
    (2) The item description and the stock number (NSN if possible) of 
the GSA item being compared. Inadequacies of the GSA items in performing 
the required functions.
    (3) The quantity required. (If demand is recurrent, nonrecurrent, or 
unpredictable, so state.)
    (4) The name and telephone number of the person to be contacted when 
questions arise concerning the request.
    (5) Other pertinent data, when applicable.
    (b) Waiver request based on determination that the GSA item can be 
purchased locally at a lower price shall include the following 
information with each request. However, the price alone

[[Page 285]]

of an item without other substantive consideration will not be 
considered sufficient justification to approve a waiver request.
    (1) A complete description of the type of item needed to satisfy the 
requirement.
    (2) The quantity required. (If demand is recurrent, nonrecurrent, or 
unpredictable, so state.)
    (3) The destination of item to be delivered.
    (4) The name and address of source.
    (5) A price comparison with the GSA item, including the NSN of the 
GSA item. Cost comparisons shall include the agency administrative cost 
to effect the local purchase.
    (6) The name and telephone number of the person to be contacted when 
questions arise concerning the request.
    (7) Other pertinent data, when applicable.
    (c) When the item is a Standard or optional form available from GSA 
stock, the provisions of Sec. 101-26.302 apply.
    (d) Agencies shall not initiate action to procure similar items from 
non-GSA sources until a request for a waiver has been requested from and 
approved by GSA. The fact that action to procure a similar item has been 
initiated will not influence GSA action on a request for waiver.
    (e) Waivers are not required for items or services procured in 
accordance with the policy set forth in Sec. 101-26.100-1 relating to 
the acquisition of the lowest cost item from GSA sources, Sec. 101-
26.401-4(f) relating to the purchase of products that are available at 
prices lower than the prices of identical products provided by multiple 
award Federal Supply Schedule contracts, or when an urgent requirement 
exists in accordance with FAR 6.302-2 (48 CFR 6.302-2).

<R05>
Sec. 101-26.100-3  Warranties.

    Through its procurement sources and programs GSA provides for 
certain types of items and services which are covered by warranties. 
Such warranties allow ordering activities additional time after 
acceptance within which to assert a right to correct certain 
deficiencies in supplies or services furnished. The additional time 
period and the specific corrective actions for which the contractor is 
responsible are usually stated in the warranty. Items and services 
subject to warranties are normally identified by a warranty marking or 
notice. Such marking or notice will state that a warranty exists, its 
extent of coverage, its duration, and whom to notify concerning defects. 
Using activities shall take the following actions when items or services 
(except for automotive vehicles and components which are subject to the 
provisions of Sec. 101-26.501-6) covered by warranty provisions are 
found to be defective during the warranty period.
    (a) Activities shall attempt to resolve all complaints where a 
warranty is involved. If the contractor replaces the item or corrects 
the deficiency, a Standard Form (SF) 368, Product Quality Deficiency 
Report, in duplicate, shall be sent to the GSA Discrepancy Reports 
Center (6FR), 1500 East Bannister Road, Kansas City, MO 64131-3088. The 
resolution of the case should be clearly stated in the text of the SF 
368. This information will be maintained as a quality history file for 
use in future procurements.
    (b) If the contractor refuses to correct, or fails to replace, a 
defective item or an aspect of service under the warranty, an SF 368, in 
duplicate, along with copies of all pertinent correspondence, shall be 
submitted to the contracting officer in the appropriate GSA commodity 
center for necessary action. The address of the contracting officer is 
contained in the contract/purchase order, except for schedule items 
where the address is shown in the Federal Supply Schedule.

<R05>
Sec. 101-26.101  Utilization of long supply and excess personal property.

    To the fullest extent practicable, agencies shall utilize 
inventories in long supply, as prescribed in subpart 101-27.3, and 
excess personal property, as prescribed in part 101-43, as a first 
source of supply in fulfilling their requirements.
[34 FR 200, Jan. 7, 1969]

<R05>
Sec. 101-26.102  Special buying services.


<R05>
Sec. 101-26.102-1  General.

    The special buying services of GSA are performed through the GSA 
special order program (SOP). The SOP allows an agency to obtain items 
not included in either the GSA stock or Federal Supply Schedule program. 
All executive agencies within the United States (including Hawaii and 
Alaska), in order to maximize the use of the Government's centralized 
supply system, shall request SOP items by submitting requisitions for 
GSA centrally managed items to GSA. GSA will process all requisitions 
for SOP items, regardless of total line item value, from activities 
electing to purchase from GSA. If an agency determines that alternative 
sources are more favorable, procurement from other sources is 
authorized: Provided, that the dollar thresholds and criteria outlined 
in Sec. 101-26.301(b)(1) through (3) are followed.
[56 FR 12456, Mar. 26, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 101-26.102-2  Utilization by military agencies.

    Military activities shall utilize the buying services of GSA when:
    (a) GSA has agreed with the Secretary of Defense, or with the 
Secretary of a military department in connection with the requirements 
of that department, to perform such buying services; and
    (b) The items involved are not properly obtainable from GSA stock or 
Federal Supply Schedules.

<R05>
Sec. 101-26.102-3  Procurement leadtime.

    When GSA performs the purchasing services for other agencies or 
activities as contemplated by this Sec. 101-26.102-3, calculation of the 
delivery dates required for the items involved must be based on the 
procurement leadtimes illustrated in the GSA publication, FEDSTRIP 
Operating Guide. These leadtimes are based on the normal time required 
after receipt of agency requisitions by GSA to effect delivery to 
destinations within the 50 States.
    (a) Time required to obtain any additional essential information 
from the requisitioning office for use in issuing a solicitation for 
bids or offers is not included in the leadtimes.
    (b) If unusually large quantities or complex items are required, 
leadtime adjustments should be made to reflect the specfic requirement. 
As an example, standard furniture items can usually be delivered in less 
than 90 days after receipt of the requisition. However, for large 
quantity or complex orders requiring a definite quantity procurement, 
delivery times may range from 4 to 6 months. Footnotes relating to 
classes where this is a frequent occurence are shown in the procurement 
leadtime table illustrated in the FEDSTRIP Operating Guide.
    (c) The procurement leadtime table illustrated in the FEDSTRIP 
Operating Guide does not apply to public exigency or other high priority 
requisitions; however, it should be used as a guide to establish 
realistic required delivery dates for such requisitions.

Sec. 101-26.102-4  Payment to GSA contractors.

    Policies and procedures covering payment to GSA contractors for 
supplies and services furnished by GSA to Government agencies are in 
subpart 101-2.1.

Sec. 101-26.103  Establishing essentiality of requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 101-26.103-1  Policy for personal property.

    To obtain maximum benefit from Government funds available for 
procurement of personal property, each executive agency shall:
    (a) Insure that personal property currently on hand is being 
utilized to the fullest extent practical and provide supporting 
justification prior to effecting new procurement for similar type 
property. (When the proposed procurement is for similar items from non-
GSA sources, the provisions of Sec. 101-26.100-2 apply.)
    (b) Procure the minimum quantity and quality of property which is 
required to support the mission of the

[[Page 287]]

agency and to satisfy the function for which the property is required.
    (c) Limit procurement of different varieties, types, sizes, colors, 
etc., of required items to those essential in satisfying the functional 
end-use purpose. To this end the quantity, quality, and variety of 
personal property required to adequately perform the end-use function 
should be determined prior to initiation of procurement processes.
[36 FR 17423, Aug. 31, 1971]


<R05>
Sec. 101-26.103-2  Restriction on personal convenience items.

    Government funds may be expended for pictures, objects of art, 
plants, or flowers (both artificial and real), or any other similar type 
items when such items are included in a plan for the decoration of 
Federal buildings approved by the agency responsible for the design and 
construction. Determinations as to the need for purchasing such items 
for use in space assigned to any agency are judgments reserved to the 
agency. Determinations with respect to public space such as corridors 
and lobbies are reserved to the agency responsible for operation of the 
building. Except as otherwise authorized by law, Government funds shall 
not be expended for pictures, objects of art, plants, flowers (both 
artificial and real), or any other similar type items intended solely 
for the personal convenience or to satisfy the personal desire of an 
official or employee. These items fall into the category of ``luxury 
items'' since they do not contribute to the fulfillment of missions 
normally assigned to Federal agencies.
[36 FR 17423, Aug. 31, 1971]


<R05>
Sec. 101-26.104  End-of-year submission of requisitions for action by GSA.

    (a) Purchase documents for supplies or services submitted to GSA at 
or near the close of a fiscal year shall reflect actual agency 
requirements and shall not be used as a means of exhausting 
appropriation balances.
    (b) Under the FEDSTRIP/MILSTRIP systems, the requisitions submitted 
to GSA are not required to reflect the applicable appropriation or 
fiscal year funds to be charged. The fund code entry on the requisition 
simply indicates to the supply source (GSA) that funds are available to 
pay the charge, thereby providing authority for the release of material 
and subsequent billing. Requisitions received by GSA in purchase 
authority format are normally converted to FEDSTRIP/MILSTRIP 
documentation so that processing can be accomplished expeditiously 
through a uniform system based on the use of automated equipment. 
Accordingly, primary responsibility rests with the ordering activity for 
ensuring that requisitions intended to be chargeable to appropriations 
expiring the last day of the fiscal year are submitted in sufficient 
time for GSA to consummate the necessary action before the end of the 
fiscal year. Requisitions submitted on or before the last day of the 
fiscal year may be chargeable to appropriations expiring on that date 
provided the ordering agency is required by law or GSA regulation to use 
GSA supply sources. When the ordering agency is not required to use GSA 
sources, requisitions for GSA stock items may be recorded as obligations 
provided the items are intended to meet a bona fide need of the fiscal 
year in which the need arises or to replace stock used in that fiscal 
year; requests for other than GSA stock items are to be recorded as 
obligations at the time GSA awards a contract for the required items. In 
the latter case, GSA procurement leadtimes illustrated in the GSA 
publication, FEDSTRIP Operating Guide, should be used as a guide for 
timely submission of these requisitions. The leadtimes referred to 
relate to the number of days between submission of a requisition and 
actual delivery of the items involved. While this may furnish some 
guidance to requisitioners, there is no direct relationship between 
those leadtimes and the time it takes for GSA to make an award of a 
contract.
    (c) End-of-year submission of requisitions which require GSA to 
award a contract not later than the last day of the fiscal year in order 
to obligate the appropriation or funds of the ordering agency will be 
annotated to indicate that GSA procurement of the requested items must 
be accomplished not later than the last day of the fiscal year in

[[Page 288]]

which the requisitions are submitted. For example, a FEDSTRIP/MILSTRIP 
requisition should be prepared to include Document Identifier Code A0E 
or A05 and reflect the annotation in the ``Remarks'' block. With this 
information GSA will attempt to complete procurement action before the 
end of the fiscal year. When a requistion is received too late to permit 
GSA to complete procurement action before the end of the fiscal year, 
the requisitioning activity will be so notified and requested to furnish 
instructions regarding the action to be taken. Based on these 
instructions, procurement action will be taken or the requisition will 
be canceled and returned to the ordering activity.
[33 FR 19013, Dec. 20, 1968, as amended at 40 FR 41093, Sept. 5, 1975; 
57 FR 3949, Feb. 3, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 101-26.105  Justification to support negotiated procurement by GSA for other agencies.

    When a requisition submitted by an agency to GSA requires 
procurement without providing for full and open competition, the agency 
submitting the requisition will be so notified and required to furnish 
specific information to assist GSA in preparing the required written 
justification. The GSA contracting officer will defer procurement action 
pending receipt of the requested information. If the requisitioning 
agency has prior knowledge that a requisition will require procurement 
without providing for full and open competition (e.g., sole source 
acquisition), sufficient information shall be included with the 
requisition to allow GSA to justify the procurement. Specifically, the 
information must include the following:
    (a) The specific needs to be satisfied in terms of identified tasks 
or work processes;
    (b) The requirements that generate the specific needs;
    (c) The characteristics of the designated item that enable it to 
satisfy the specific needs, if a specific source(s) is requested;
    (d) The identification of other items evaluated and, for each, a 
statement of the characteristics (or lack thereof) which preclude their 
satisfying the specific needs, if a specific source(s) is requested;
    (e) The citation of the applicable law, if any, authorizing other 
than full and open competition (see FAR 6.302 (48 CFR 6.302); and
    (f) Any required certifications, pursuant to FAR 6.303-2(b) (48 CFR 
6.303-2(b)), that supporting data is complete and accurate.
[56 FR 12456, Mar. 26, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 101-26.106  Consolidation of requirements.

    Full consideration shall be given to the consolidation of individual 
small volume requirements to enable the Government to benefit from lower 
prices normally obtainable through definite quantity contracts for 
larger volume procurements. This policy pertains to procurement from 
commercial sources either directly or through an intermediary agency and 
does not apply to GSA stock items or small volume requirements normally 
obtained from GSA customer supply centers. When it is practical, each 
agency shall establish procedures that will permit planned requirements 
consolidation on an agencywide basis. When it is impractical to plan 
requirements on an agencywide consolidated basis, the requirements 
consolidation effort may be limited to a bureau, to other agency 
segments, or to a program, if such limited consolidation will provide 
significant price advantages when procurement is effected on a volume 
basis. Requisitions for item requirements exceeding maximum order 
limitations in Federal Supply Schedule contracts shall be submitted to 
GSA in accordance with the applicable instructions in the respective 
schedules. Special buying services desired by agencies for procurement 
of other consolidated item requirements shall be requested from GSA in 
accordance with Sec. 101-26.102.

<R05>
Sec. 101-26.200  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart prescribes a uniform requisitioning and issue system 
for use in obtaining supplies and equipment from GSA, Department of 
Defense, and Veterans Administration sources.
[43 FR 19852, May 9, 1978]


<R05>
Sec. 101-26.201  General.

    This requisitioning and issue system is identified as the Federal 
Standard Requisitioning and Issue Procedures (FEDSTRIP) and is similar 
to and compatible with the Military Standard Requisitioning and Issue 
Procedures (MILSTRIP). The FEDSTRIP system provides GSA and other supply 
sources the means to automate the processing of requisitions. Detailed 
instructions required to implement FEDSTRIP are contained in the GSA 
Handbook, FEDSTRIP Operating Guide (FPMR 101-26.2), which is issued and 
maintained by the Commissioner, Federal Supply Service, GSA.
[43 FR 19852, May 9, 1978]


<R05>
Sec. 101-26.202  Applicability.

    The FEDSTRIP system shall be used by civilian agencies to requistion 
any item from GSA or to requisition any specifically authorized item 
from Department of Defense (DOD). Requisitions to the Veterans 
Administration (VA) should be submitted on punched cards in FEDSTRIP 
format or typed on Standard Form 147, Order for Supplies or Services.
[43 FR 19853, May 9, 1978]


<R05>
Sec. 101-26.203  Activity address codes.

    To obtain items through the FEDSTRIP system, each ordering activity 
is required to have an activity address code. The FEDSTRIP Operating 
Guide (FPMR 101-26.2) contains instructions to civilian agencies on 
requesting activity address codes. Once assigned, an activity address 
code allows an activity to order supplies under the FEDSTRIP system. 
Because there is a potential for abuse in the use of these codes, 
agencies shall establish stringent internal controls to ensure

[[Page 290]]

that the codes are used only by authorized personnel. It is imperative 
that all requests for activity address codes or deletions or address 
changes flow through a central contact point in the agency headquarters 
or regions where the need, purpose, and validity of the request can be 
verified. Agencies should send GSA the addresses of the contact points 
(mailing address: General Services Administration (FSR), Washington, DC 
20406). GSA will only honor requests from the established points within 
the agency. GSA will periodically send a listing of current activity 
address codes and addresses to contact points for review.

    This subpart prescribes policy and procedures governing the 
procurement by agencies of items of supply stocked by GSA, including 
reporting and obtaining adjustments for overages, shortages, and damages 
and the issue of used, repaired, and rehabilitated items in serviceable 
condition.

<R05>
Sec. 101-26.301  Applicability.

    All executive agencies within the United States (including Hawaii 
and Alaska), in order to maximize the use of the Government's 
centralized supply system, shall requisition GSA stock items in 
accordance with the following:
    (a) When the requirement is for Standard and optional forms, an item 
produced by the Federal Prison Industries, Inc. (FPI), or an item listed 
in the procurement list published by the Committee for Purchase from the 
Blind and Other Severely Handicapped (NIB-NISH), the dollar thresholds 
and language indicated in paragraph (b) of this section are not 
applicable and acquisition of such items continues to be as set forth in 
the applicable sections of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, Federal 
Property Management Regulations and other appropriate regulations. In 
order to identify FPI/NIB-NISH items stocked by GSA, they are marked 
with an asterisk in the GSA Supply Catalog NSN index,
    (b) GSA will process all requisitions for stock items, regardless of 
total line item value, from activities electing to purchase from GSA. If 
an agency determines that alternative sources are more favorable, the 
following guidelines shall apply. However, the price alone of an item 
without other substantive consideration will not be considered as 
sufficient justification to use alternative sources. (These guidelines 
also apply to the procurement of special order program (SOP) established 
source, see Sec. 101-26.102-1.)
    (1) When the total value of the line item requirement is less than 
$100, procurement from other sources is authorized.
    (2) When the total value of the line item requirement is $100 or 
more, but less than $5,000, procurement from other sources is 
authorized: provided, that a written justification shall be prepared and 
placed in the purchase file stating that such action is judged to be in 
the best interest of the Government in terms of the combination of 
quality, timeliness, and cost that best meets the requirement. Cost 
comparisons shall include the agency administrative cost to effect a 
local purchase.
    (3) For total line item requirements of $5,000 and over, agencies 
shall submit a requisition to GSA unless a waiver has been approved by 
GSA. Request for waivers shall be submitted in accordance with Sec. 101-
26.100-2.
    (c) Agencies shall not divide requisitions to avoid higher threshold 
documentation requirements.
    (d) In authorizing procurements in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) 
of

[[Page 291]]

this section, agencies shall reimburse GSA for any cost arising out of 
breach of a GSA contract, where sufficient justification is not 
documented in their procurement files.
[56 FR 12457, Mar. 26, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 101-26.301-1  Similar items.

    (a) Agencies required to requisition, exclusively, items listed in 
the GSA Supply Catalog shall utilize such items in lieu of procuring 
similar items from other sources when the GSA items will adequately 
serve the required functional end-use purpose.
    (b) When an agency determines that items available from GSA stock 
will not serve the required functional end-use purpose of the item 
proposed to be procured, a request to waive the requirement to use this 
source shall be submitted to GSA for consideration in accordance with 
the provisions of Sec. 101-26.100-2.

<R05>
Sec. 101-26.301-2  Issue of used, repaired, and rehabilitated items in serviceable condition.

    Stock items returned to GSA under the provisions of subpart 101-27.5 
will be reissued to all requisitioning activities without distinction 
between new, used, repaired, or rehabilitated items in serviceable 
condition. Requisitioning agencies will be billed for these items at the 
current GSA selling price.
[38 FR 28566, Oct. 15, 1973]


<R05>
Sec. 101-26.302  Standard and optional forms.

    Agencies shall obtain Standard and optional forms by requisitioning 
them from GSA (FSS) unless the forms have been approved by GSA (KMPS) to 
be stocked and distributed by the promulgating agency or to be 
reproduced locally. Assistance or information on the forms management 
program may be obtained by contacting GSA (KMPS), Washington, DC 20405. 
(See part 201-45, subpart 201-45.5 of this chapter.)
    (a) For purposes of economy, existing stocks are depleted prior to 
issuance of revisions unless the promulgating agency determines previous 
editions unusable and obsolete.
    (b) Forms or form assemblies which deviate from the standard and 
optional forms listed in the GSA Supply Catalog have restricted use and 
are not stocked. Agencies requiring such forms shall prepare and 
transmit a Standard Form 1, Printing and Binding Requisition, or 
Standard Form 1-C, Printing and Binding Requisition for Specialty Items, 
to the General Services Administration, Federal Supply Service (FCNI), 
Washington, DC 20406, for review and submission to GPO. Prior approval 
of GSA (KMPS) is required whenever the content or construction of a form 
is altered or modified. Requests for such exceptions may be obtained by 
submission of a SF 152, Requests for Clearance of a Standard or Optional 
Form or Exception, to GSA (KMPS), with appropriate justification.
    (c) Certain standard forms are serially numbered and are to be 
accounted for to prevent possible fraudulent use. The General Accounting 
Office (GAO) requires accurate accountability records to be maintained 
for such items by applicable agencies. GSA forwards a receipt 
verification card with each shipment of accountable forms. The receiving 
agency is responsible for verifying receipt of the serially numbered 
forms in the shipment by returning the card to the address preprinted on 
the card. See Sec. 101-41.308 of this chapter for information governing 
agency control and disposition of unused U.S. Government Bills of Lading 
(GBL's).
    (d) Standard and optional forms which are excess to the needs of an 
agency shall be reported to GSA in the same manner as other excess 
personal property pursuant to part 101-43 of this chapter. Obsolete 
forms shall be disposed of under the provisions of part 101-45 of this 
chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 101-26.303  Out-of-stock items.

    Generally, it is more advantageous to agencies if GSA backorders 
requisitions for out-of-stock items rather than cancels requisitions. 
Unless notified by agencies not to backorder a requisition, through 
FEDSTRIP advice codes 2C or 2J, a back order will be established. The 
agency will be notified of the estimated date that shipment

[[Page 292]]

will be made. Upon receipt of the status transaction, the agency shall 
determine if the estimated shipping date will meet its needs and, as 
appropriate: (a) Accept the back order, (b) request a suitable 
substitute item, or (c) request cancellation in accordance with 
Sec. 101-26.309.
[43 FR 22210, May 24, 1978]


<R05>
Sec. 101-26.304  Substitution policy.

    In supplying items requisitioned from GSA stock, GSA may substitute 
items with similar characteristics. Substitute items may be issued from 
new stock or from returned stock that is in serviceable condition 
(condition code A) as described in Sec. 101-27.503-1. A notice of intent 
to substitute will be provided to the ordering activity only if the 
characteristics of the substitute item differ substantially from the 
characteristics of the item requisitioned. Ordering activities may 
prevent substitution by entering advice code 2B (do not substitute) or 
2J (do not substitute or backorder) in cc 65-66 of requisitions.
[45 FR 27764, Apr. 24, 1980]


<R05>
Sec. 101-26.305  Submission of orders to GSA.

    (a) Orders shall be submitted in accordance with the instructions in 
the FEDSTRIP Operating Guide (FPMR 101-26.2).
    (b) Orders in other than FEDSTRIP format shall be submitted:
    (1) In original only when for shipment to destinations in the United 
States, including Hawaii but excluding Alaska.
    (2) In accordance with applicable GSA/agency agreements when for 
shipment to Alaska or for export to destinations outside the United 
States.
    (c) Sufficient funds should be reserved by the requisitioner to 
cover expenses incurred by GSA in export packing, marking, 
documentation, etc. GSA will assess a surcharge on all material ordered 
and delivered to customers in certain overseas areas. The surcharge is a 
percentage factor of the value of the material shipped. Information on 
the specific areas and the current percentage of surcharge is included 
in the GSA Handbook, Discrepancies or Deficiencies in GSA or DOD 
Shipments, Material, or Billings (FPMR 101-26.8). The surcharge is a 
percentage factor of the value of the material shipped. Information on 
the current percentage of surcharge may be obtained from the GSA 
regional office to which orders are submitted.

<R05>
Sec. 101-26.306  Planned requisitioning for GSA stock items.

    In preparing requisitions for GSA stock items, agencies shall follow 
schedules or cyclical plans for replenishment of stocks so as to reduce 
the number of repetitive requisitions required while adjusting ordering 
frequency to comply with the economic order quantity principle. (See 
Sec. 101-27.102.)
[43 FR 22211, May 24, 1978]


<R05>
Sec. 101-26.307  Processing overages, shortages, and damages.

    (a) Transportation-type discrepancies shall be processed in 
accordance with the instructions in subpart 101-40.7 when the 
discrepancies are the fault of the carrier and occur while the shipments 
are in the possession of:
    (1) International ocean or air carriers, regardless of who pays the 
transportation charges, except when shipment is on a through Government 
bill of lading (TGBL) or is made through the Defense Transportation 
System (DTS) (Discrepancies in shipments on a TGBL or which occur while 
in the DTS shall be reported as prescribed in subpart 101-26.8.); or
    (2) Carriers within the continental United States, when other than 
GSA or DOD pays the transportation charges.
    (b) Reporting discrepancies or deficiencies in material or shipments 
and processing requests for or documenting adjustments in billings from 
or directed by GSA activities shall be in accordance with the provisions 
of subpart 101-26.8.

<R05>
Sec. 101-26.308  Obtaining filing cabinets.

    Each agency head, after taking actions prescribed in Sec. 101-
25.302-2, shall

[[Page 293]]

determine agency requirements for filing cabinets. When additional 
filing cabinets are required, requisitions shall be submitted in 
FEDSTRIP format to the GSA region supporting the geographic area in 
which the requisitioning agency is located.
[43 FR 22211, May 24, 1978]


<R05>
Sec. 101-26.309  Cancellation of orders for GSA stock items.

    When an agency determines that material ordered from GSA is not 
required, GSA will accept requests for cancellation as long as the items 
ordered have not been shipped. However, since processing cancellations 
is costly and interferes with normal order processing, agencies are 
cautioned to use discretion in requesting cancellation of low dollar 
value orders. Cancellation of orders may be accomplished by agencies 
through written, telegraphic, or telephonic communication with the GSA 
regional office to which the order was sent. However, telephonic 
communication should be used whenever feasible to forestall shipment of 
material and subsequent billing by GSA. If material has been shipped, 
GSA will advise that cancellation cannot be effected and agency requests 
for return for credit will be processed under the provisions of 
Secs. 101-26.310 and 101-26.311.

<R05>
Sec. 101-26.310  Ordering errors.

    In accordance with the provisions of this Sec. 101-26.310, GSA may 
authorize agencies to return for credit material that has been ordered 
in error by the agency. Material shipped in error by GSA is subject to 
the provisions of the GSA Handbook, Discrepancies or Deficiencies in GSA 
or DOD Shipments, Material, or Billings (FPMR 101-26.8). Credit for 
material ordered in error will be based on the selling price billed the 
agency at the time shipment was made to the agency, with the adjustment 
reflected in current or future billings. Material shall not be returned 
until appropriate documentation is received from GSA.
    (a) The return of material by an agency, to correct ordering errors, 
may be authorized and later accepted by GSA: Provided,
    (1) The value of the material exceeds $25 per line item based on the 
selling price billed the customer.
    (2) Authorization to return is requested from the GSA Discrepancy 
Reports Center (6FRB), 1500 East Bannister Road, Kansas City, MO 64131 
within 45 calendar days (60 calendar days for overseas points) after 
receipt of shipment. Requests should always contain a complete 
explanation of reason(s) for return of the material. Exceptions may be 
granted on a case-by-case basis when GSA is in need of the material and 
extenuating circumstances precluded earlier submission of the request.
    (3) Each item is in ``like-new'' condition and is identified by a 
stock number in the current edition of the GSA Supply Catalog.
    (4) Each item is identified with a specific purchase order or 
requisition number.
    (5) The condition of the material is acceptable on inspection by 
GSA. When it is not acceptable, disposition, without credit, will be 
made by GSA. However, when the condition is attributable to carrier 
negligence, subsequent credit allowed by GSA will be reduced by the 
amount to be paid the agency by the carrier for damages incurred.
    (6) The merchandise to be returned will not adversely affect the GSA 
nationwide inventory situation.
    (7) The return transportation costs are not excessive in relation to 
the cost of the material.
    (b) Transportation costs on material specifically authorized for 
return by a GSA regional office will be paid by the customer activity. 
Claims against carriers for discrepancies in shipment will also be the 
responsibility of the customer activity in accordance with the 
provisions of subpart 101-40.7. When appropriate, GSA will prepare 
initial documentation to support claim actions.

<R05>
Sec. 101-26.311  Frustrated shipments.

    (a) At the request of the ordering agency, GSA may authorize 
diversion or return for credit of any shipment consigned to an overseas 
destination

[[Page 294]]

which, while en route, cannot be continued onward for any reason and for 
which the consignee or requisitioning agency cannot provide diversion 
instructions:


Provided, The frustration occurs at a water or air terminal and title to 
the material has not passed from the Government. Frustrated shipments 
located outside the United States are the responsibility of the 
consignee or ordering agency. However, GSA will assist the agency 
whenever possible in disposing of the material when it cannot be 
utilized by the overseas control area of the agency, e.g., oversea 
command or AID area.
    (b) Requests to GSA for disposition instructions shall be directed 
to the GSA office which made the shipment. Data provided by the agency 
shall include the original requisition document number, purchase order 
number (if any), supplementary addresses, and present location of the 
frustrated shipment. In addition, the agency should furnish the 
Government bill of lading number or commercial bill of lading reference, 
and the carrier's freight or waybill number.
    (c) GSA may direct disposition of such material through any of the 
means listed below. Disposition instructions will include a 
determination by GSA as to the responsibility for payment of 
transportation costs.
    (1) Shipment of material to another consignee.
    (2) Temporary storage pending further instructions.
    (3) Return to GSA stock.
    (4) Disposal by agency.
    (5) Disposition through other means if deemed to be in the best 
interest of the Government.
    (d) GSA will provide required documentation to accomplish the 
desired action and will, if appropriate, initiate necessary adjustments 
in billing.
    (e) Frustrated shipments involving other than GSA stock items will 
be treated in a manner similar to that prescribed in this Sec. 101-
26.311 on a case by case basis.

Sec. 101-26.501  Purchase of new motor vehicles.

    (a) It shall be the policy to procure commercially available motor 
vehicles, unless other vehicles are specifically required.
    (b) New sedans, station wagons, and light trucks (other than those 
to be used for law enforcement or where other than standard vehicles are 
required) shall be procured as follows: Sedans, class IB-subcompact or 
II-compact; station wagons, class I-subcompact or class II compact 
vehicles, as described in Federal standard No. 122; and light trucks as 
defined in Federal standard Nos. 292 and 307. (Federal standard Nos. 
122, 292, and 307 as used in this section mean the latest editions.)
    Requisitions submitted to GSA for motor vehicles shall be in 
conformance with the requirements of subpart 101-38.1.
    (1) Standard passenger vehicles as defined in Federal standard No. 
122 are considered to be completely equipped for ordinary operation and 
are subject to the maximum statutory price limitation.
    (2) Items (vehicles) included in Federal standard No. 122 other than 
those

[[Page 295]]

listed as standard (basic units) are considered to be equipped with 
additional systems and equipment for passenger vehicles.
    (c) Requisitions submitted to GSA for the acquisition of new 
passenger vehicles and light trucks under 8500 GVWR (gross vehicle 
weight rating) shall be in conformance with Pub. L. 94-163 and Executive 
Order 12375.
    (d) New trucks and buses shall be requisitioned in accordance with 
the provisions of this Sec. 101-26.501 and the following:
    (1) Light trucks shall be in accordance with Federal standard Nos. 
292 and 307; and
    (2) Medium and heavy trucks and buses, when not procured from 
standardized buying programs, shall be in accordance with the latest 
editions of Federal standard No. 794, Federal specification Nos. KKK-T-
2107, 2108, 2109, 2110, 2111, and Federal specification No. KKK-B-1579. 
Standardized buying programs shall be based on these specifications as 
appropriate.
    (e) Selection of additional systems or equipment in new vehicles 
shall be made by the requiring agency and shall be based on the need to 
provide for overall safety, efficiency, economy, and suitability of the 
vehicle for the purposes intended pursuant to Sec. 101-38.104-2.
    (1) The essentiality of such systems or equipment shall be weighed 
against the economic factors involved, the potential benefits to be 
derived therefrom, and the impact on the fuel consumption 
characteristics of the vehicle.
    (2) Additional systems or equipment requested to be purchased by GSA 
will be construed to have been determined essential for the effective 
operation of the vehicle involved by the agency head or a designee. When 
systems or equipment other than those listed in Federal standards are 
requested, these systems or equipment shall be considered and treated as 
deviations under Sec. 101-26.501-4(b).

<R05>
Sec. 101-26.501-1  General.

    Except as provided for the Department of Defense (DOD) in paragraph 
(a) of this section, each executive agency shall submit to GSA for 
procurement its orders for purchase in the United States of all new 
passenger motor vehicles (FSC 2310), trucks or truck tractors (FSC 
2320), trailers (FSC 2330) van type (with payload of not less than 5,000 
nor more than 50,000 pounds), and firetrucks and firefighting trailers 
(FSC 4210). Specifically included are sedans, station wagons, carryalls, 
ambulances, buses, and trucks, including trucks with specialized mounted 
equipment, truck chassis with special purpose bodies, and all van-type 
trailers (with payload of not less than 5,000 nor more than 50,000 
pounds).
    (a) DOD shall submit to GSA for procurement its orders for purchase 
in the United States for all non-tactical vehicles including, but not 
limited to, commercial-type passenger motor vehicles (FSC 2310), 
including buses, and trucks and truck tractors (FSC 2320).
    (b) When it is determined by the ordering activity that requirements 
for passenger motor vehicles and trucks indicate the need for 
procurement by buying activities other than GSA, a request for waiver 
justifying the procurement shall be submitted in writing to the General 
Services Administration (FCA), Washington, DC 20406. GSA will notify 
agencies in writing whether a waiver has been granted. Justification may 
be based on the urgency of need or the fact that the vehicle has unique 
characteristics, such as special purpose body or equipment, requiring 
the agency personnel to closely supervise installation of the equipment 
by the contractor; e.g., when a medical van is to be equipped with 
Government- or contractor-supplied equipment. Requests for procurement 
through sources other than GSA will be handled on an individual basis 
provided full justification is submitted therefore.
    (c) When it is determined by GSA that procurement of an individual 
agency requirement by GSA would offer no advantage over local purchase 
of the item, GSA may grant the ordering activity authority for local 
purchase. When such a determination is made, the order will be returned 
to the

[[Page 296]]

ordering agency with written authority for local purchase.

Sec. 101-26.501-2  Standardized buying programs.

    Wherever practical, requirements for motor vehicles will be 
satisfied under existing standardized buying programs (Indefinite 
Quantity, Requirements, Federal Supply Schedule contracts). Agencies not 
familiar with these programs, or seeking additional information about 
them, are encouraged to contact the GSA Automotive Commodity Center 
prior to submitting their orders.
    (a) Requirements contracts are in place or anticipated to be in 
place for the following types of standard motor vehicles:
    (1) Medium and heavy trucks:

Sec. 101-26.501-3  Consolidated purchase program.

    (a) Except as noted in Sec. 101-26.501(a) and where motor vehicle 
requirements can not be satisfied under the standardized buying programs 
described in Sec. 101-26.501-2, GSA will continue to make consolidated 
procurements of all motor vehicle types each year to achieve maximum 
benefits and economies, as follows:
    (1) Family buys--Large annual consolidated buys for sedans, station 
wagons, and standard light trucks, purchased in the aggregate by group 
to the extent practical. These procurements are designed to obtain the 
best market prices available and are normally definite quantity type 
with maximum option potential. It is anticipated that resulting 
contracts will remain in place from approximately mid-November to 
approximately May 1 (or end of model year closeout).
    (2) Two (2) volume procurements each year for light trucks of the 
types covered by Federal standard Nos. 292 and 307, but not covered by 
standardized buying programs or family buys, as previously described. 
Requisitions to be included under these two procurements should reach 
the GSA Automotive Commodity Center by June 15 and December 1 
respectively.
    (3) Up to three (3) consolidated procurements for medium and heavy 
trucks and buses of the types covered by Federal standard No. 794, 
Federal specification Nos. KKK-T-2107, 2108, 2109, 2110, 2111, and 
Federal specification No. KKK-B-1579.
    (b) Requirements not covered by Federal standards 122, 292, 307, or 
794 shall conform with the provisions of Sec. 101-26.501-4.

procured either under a standardized buying program, as described in 
Sec. 101-26.501-2, or a consolidated purchase program, as described in 
Sec. 101-26.501-3, unless a statement is included justifying the need 
for delivery other than the delivery times indicated in this section. 
Requisitions containing a statement of justification will be handled on 
an emergency basis in accordance with Sec. 101-26.501-5(b).
    (b) Emergency requirements. Emergency requirements will receive 
special handling only when the requisitions are accompanied by adequate 
justification for individual purchase action. Every effort will be made 
to meet the delivery date specified in the requisition.
    (c) Delivery time. Delivery times for motor vehicle requirements 
will range widely depending on method of purchase.
    (1) Existing contracts. Delivery times for motor vehicle 
requirements submitted and placed against existing in-place contracts 
(family buy option, requirements contract or Federal Supply Schedule 
contract) will range from 60 to 150 days from date of purchase order.
    (2) Volume consolidated procurements. Delivery times for motor 
vehicle requirements submitted for volume consolidated purchases will 
range from 210 to 330 days after solicitation consolidation date. 
Included in delivery time estimates are 90 to 105 days required for 
soliciting and receiving offers, 30 to 60 days for evaluation and award 
of contracts, 90 to 180 days from date of

not be procured under the standardized buying programs or consolidated 
purchase programs described in Secs. 101-26.501-2 and 101-26.501-3, 240 
to 270 days from date of award are usually required to effect delivery. 
However, special purpose vehicles with unique characteristics, such as 
certain types of firetrucks, may require longer delivery. In such 
instances, every effort will be made by GSA to facilitate deliveries and 
keep the requisitioning agencies informed of any unauthorized delay.

<R05>
Sec. 101-26.501-6  Forms used in connection with delivery of vehicles.

    (a) GSA Form 1398, GSA Purchased Vehicle. This form is used by the 
contractor to indicate that preshipment inspection and servicing of each 
vehicle has been performed. The contractor is required to complete GSA 
Form 1398 (illustrated at Sec. 101-26.4902-1398) and affix it, 
preferably, to the lock face or door frame of the right front door after 
the final inspection. The form should be left in place during the 
warranty period to permit prompt identification of vehicles requiring 
dealer repairs pursuant to the warranty.
    (b) Standard Form 368, Quality Deficiency Report (Category II). GSA 
is constantly striving to improve customer service and the quality of 
motor vehicles for which it contracts. To inform contractors of the 
deficiencies noted during the life of the vehicles, Standard Form 368 
shall be prepared by the consignee and sent to GSA describing details of 
vehicle deficiency and action taken for correction. Procedures for 
documenting and reporting quality deficiencies are set forth in the GSA 
Publication ``Discrepancies or Deficiencies in GSA or DOD Shipments, 
Material or Billings.'' Agencies are urged to report all deficiencies to 
GSA irrespective of satisfactory corrective action taken by the 
manufacturer's authorized dealer. If the dealer refuses to take 
corrective action on any vehicle within its warranty period, the report 
shall so state and include an explanation of circumstances. Standard 
Form 368 shall also be used to report all noncompliance with 
specifications or other requirements of the purchase order.
    (c) Instructions to Consignee Receiving New Motor Vehicles Purchased 
by General Services Administration. This information is printed on the 
reverse of the consignee copy of the delivery order. Personnel 
responsible for receipt and operation of Government motor vehicles 
should be familiar with the instructions and information contained in 
the document entitled ``Instructions to Consignee Receiving New Motor 
Vehicles Purchased by General Services Administration.''

Sec. 101-26.501-9  Centralized motor vehicle leasing program.

    GSA has a centralized leasing program to provide an additional 
source of motor vehicle support to all Federal agencies. This program 
relieves Federal agencies that use it from both the time constraints and 
administrative costs associated with independently entering into lease 
contracts. The centralized leasing program covers subcompact, compact, 
and midsize sedans, station wagons, and certain types of light trucks 
(pickups and vans). Participation in the centralized leasing program is 
mandatory on all executive agencies of the Federal Government (excluding 
the Department of Defense and the U.S. Postal Service) within the 48 
contiguous States and Washington, DC. However, agencies must obtain GSA 
authorization to lease in accordance with Sec. 101-39.205 prior to using

these established mandatory use contracts. For further information on 
existing contracts, including vehicles covered, rates, and terms and 
conditions of the contract(s), contact General Services Administration

area in which the requisitioner is located.
    (b) Requisitions for all types of EDP tape and instrumentation tape 
(wide and intermediate band) not covered by Federal Supply Schedule 
contracts shall be submitted to GSA for purchase action when the dollar 
value of the requisitions exceeds, or is estimated to exceed, $2,500 for 
EDP tape and $5,000 for instrumentation tape. However, regardless of the 
amount involved (including requisitions estimated to be less than the 
dollar limitations referenced above), purchase action shall not be taken 
by GSA or an agency unless a waiver of the requirement for using items 
of tape available from Federal Supply Schedule contracts has been 
furnished in accordance with Sec. 101-26.100-2.

Requests for waivers shall be submitted to the Commissioner, Federal 
Supply Service (F), General Services Administration, Washington, DC 
20406. The requests shall fully describe the type of tape required and 
state the reasons Federal Supply Schedule items will not adequately 
serve the agency's needs. GSA will notify the requesting agency in 
writing of the action taken on the requests. To reduce leadtime, 
requisitions may be submitted in FEDSTRIP format with the requests for 
waivers. Requisitions for which a waiver has first been obtained shall 
be submitted with a copy of the waiver to the GSA regional office 
supporting the geographic area in which the requisitioner is located. 
GSA will either arrange for procurement of the items or authorize the 
requesting agency to procure them.
    (c) When establishing required delivery dates in purchase requests 
submitted in accordance with this Sec. 101-26.508-2, agencies should 
normally allow 105 days leadtime to permit orderly procurement by GSA. 
In addition to this 105 days leadtime, inspection and testing of the 
tape requires approximately 15 days.
    (d) When an agency submitting a purchase request in accordance with 
this Sec. 101-26.508-2 has a need for scheduled deliveries, minimum or 
maximum order quantities, or other special arrangements, GSA will 
develop specific provisions to accommodate the needs. The provisions 
will be based on information furnished by the agency concerned and will 
be included in solicitations for offers and resultant contracts.

Sec. 101-26.602-2  Procurement of packaged petroleum products.

    (a) Packaged petroleum products listed in Federal Supply Catalog for 
Civil Agencies shall be obtained by submitting requisitions prepared in 
accordance with the FEDSTRIP Operating Guide (FPMR 101-26.2) to the 
Defense General Supply Center (DGSC), Richmond, Va. 23297, using routing 
identifier code S9G. The Federal Supply Catalog for Civil Agencies may 
be obtained, upon written request, from the Commander, Defense Logistics 
Services Center, Attn: DLSC-T, Battle Creek, Mich. 49016. Requisitions 
for packaged petroleum items not in this catalog and not otherwise 
included in Defense Fuel Supply Center (DFSC) procurements under the 
provisions of Sec. 101-26.602-1 may be submitted to DGSC. DGSC will 
supply the items from inventory or will refer the requisitions to DFSC 
for purchase and direct delivery to the requisitioner. Packaged 
petroleum items may be obtained from other Federal activities by 
agreement with the activity concerned or by local purchase when such 
action is authorized under the provisions of the Defense Logistics 
Agency (DLA) local purchase policy contained in paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (b) Activities may effect local purchase of any DLA-managed, 
centrally procured item, commercialy available, provided the purchase:
    (1) Is limited to immediate-use requirements generated by emergency 
conditions (e.g., work stoppage, etc.), or
    (2) Is to satisfy a routine requirement having a total line value 
not in excess of $25 and is determined to be the most economical method 
of supply.
    (c) DGSC may return requisitions for local purchase action citing 
FEDSTRIP/MILSTRIP status code CW with the concurrence of the 
requisitioning activity when it is deemed that a local purchase action 
would be the most economical method of supply. A determination will be 
based on recognition of excessive costs (procurement, transportation/
shipping, and special packaging considerations) as compared to those 
costs associated with local purchase action. Requisition priorities, 
backorder situations, procurement and required delivery dates (PDD/RDD), 
and requisition line item dollar values shall not be a basis or 
consideration for a Status Code CW reject action. Requisitions from 
overseas activities will not be returned to overseas activities for a 
local purchase action.

<R05>
Sec. 101-26.803-2  Reporting quality deficiencies.

    (a) Quality deficiencies are defined as defects or nonconforming 
conditions which limit or prohibit the item received from fulfilling its 
intended purpose. Quality deficiencies include deficiencies in design, 
specification, material, manufacturing, and workmanship. Timely 
reporting of all quality deficiencies is essential to maintain an 
acceptable quality level for common-use items. GSA relies on agency 
reporting of quality deficiencies in order to act to remove the 
defective items from the supply system as well as to document contractor 
performance files for use in future procurements.
    (b) A product deficiency which may cause death, injury, or severe 
occupational illness, or directly restrict the mission capabilities of 
the using organization, is called a ``category I'' complaint. Quality 
complaints that do not meet the category I criteria are called 
``category II'' complaints. Standard Form (SF) 368, Quality Deficiency 
Report, or a message in the format of the Standard Form 368, is used to 
report quality deficiencies.
    (c) Standard Form 368 (including SF's 368 submitted in message 
formats) are required for all product quality deficiencies that involve 
material (1) shipped to the user from a GSA distribution center 
(including shipments made directly to the user from GSA distribution 
centers as well as ``indirect'' shipments (shipments with intermediate 
stops between the GSA distribution center and the ultimate user)), (2) 
shipped to the user from a DOD depot or another Government activity, as 
directed by GSA, (3) purchased by GSA for the user and inspected by GSA, 
or (4) ordered from a GSA Federal Supply Schedule contract which 
specified source inspection by GSA.
    (d) Category I complaints are to be reported to GSA by telephone or 
telegraphic message within 72 hours of discovery. Category II complaints 
are to be reported within 15 days after discovery.
    (e) Standard Forms 368 (in triplicate) should be sent to the 
following address: GSA Discrepancy Reports Centers (6 FR-Q), 1500 East 
Bannister Road, Kansas City, MO 64131-3088. Communications routing 
indicator: RUEVFXE (unclassified), RULSSAA (classified), Com: (816) 926-
7447, FTS: 926-7447, AUTOVON: 465-7447.

In addition, when reporting a category I product quality deficiency 
condition, an information copy should be sent to the following address: 
General Services Administration, FSS, Office of Quality and Contract 
Administration, Quality Assurance Division (FQA), Washington, DC 20406. 
Communications routing indicator: RUEVFWM (unclassified), RULSSAA 
(classified), COM: (703) 557-8515, FTS: 557-8515.
    (f) For defective items covered by a manufacturer's commercial 
warranty, activities should initially attempt to resolve all complaints 
on these items themselves (examples of items with a commercial warranty 
are vehicles, major appliances such as gas and electric ranges, washing 
machines, dishwashers, and refrigerators). If the contractor replaces or 
corrects the deficiency, an SF 368, in triplicate, should be sent to the 
Discrepancy Reports Center at the above address. The resolution of the 
case should be clearly stated in the text of the SF 368.
    (g) If, however, the contractor refuses to correct, or fails to 
replace, either a defective item or an aspect of service under the 
warranty, an SF 368, along with copies of all pertinent correspondence, 
should be forwarded to the GSA office executing the contract (address 
will be contained in the pertinent contract/purchase order). An 
information copy of the SF 368 should also be submitted to the 
Discrepancy Reports Center at the above address.
    (h) For items ordered from a GSA Federal Supply Schedule contract 
when the inspection is performed by an activity other than GSA or when 
the items are purchased by GSA for the user but not inspected by GSA, 
activities should initially attempt to resolve all complaints on these 
items directly with the contractor. If the contractor refuses to 
correct, or fails to replace a defective item, an SF 368, along with 
copies of all correspondence, should be forwarded to the GSA office 
executing the contract (address will be contained in the pertinent 
contract/purchase order). An information copy of the SF

[[Page 313]]

368 should also be submitted to the Discrepancy Reports Center at the 
above address.
    (i) Information submitted to the Discrepancy Reports Center 
regarding defective items will be maintained as a quality history file 
for use in future procurements.
    (j) Additional information regarding reporting of quality 
deficiences may be obtained by referring to chapter 4 of the GSA 
publication cited in Sec. 101-26.803-1.

the carrier and occur while the shipments are in the possession of:
    (1) International ocean or air carriers, regardless of who pays the 
transportation charges, except when shipment is on a through Government 
bill of lading (TGBL), or is made through the Defense Transportation 
System (DTS). Discrepancies in shipments on a TGBL or which occur while 
in the DTS shall be reported as prescribed in the GSA publication 
referenced in Sec. 101-26.803-1; or
    (2) Carriers within the continental United States, when other than 
GSA or DOD pays the transportation charges.
    (b) All other shipping, transportation, or billing discrepancies 
shall be reported on the forms, and within the time frames, dollar 
limitations, and according to the procedures prescribed in the GSA 
publication referenced in Sec. 101-26.803-1.

<R05>
Sec. 101-27.101  General.

    Each agency shall establish and maintain such control of personal 
property inventories as will assure that the total cost involved will be 
kept to the minimum consistent with program needs. For purposes of stock 
replenishment, inventories may be considered to be composed of active 
inventory which is that portion carried to satisfy average expected 
demand, and safety stock which is that portion carried for protection 
against stock depletion occurring when demand exceeds average expected 
demand, or when leadtime is greater than anticipated.
    (a) In establishing active inventory levels, consideration shall be 
given to the average demand of individual items, space availability, 
procurement costs, inventory carrying costs, purchase prices, quantity 
discounts, transportation costs, other pertinent costs, and statutory 
and budgetary limitations.
    (b) In establishing safety stock levels, consideration shall be

Sec. 101-27.102-3  Limitations on use.

    (a) When there are no limiting factors which preclude its 
application, such as space or budgetary limitations, the basic EOQ 
techniques shall be used.
    (b) When a space, personnel, or budgetary limitation precludes 
application of the basic EOQ technique, a modification of the technique 
may be made provided the modification produces:
    (1) The fewest possible replenishments for a given level of 
inventory investment; or
    (2) The lowest possible level of inventory investment for a given 
number of replenishments.
    (c) When quantity purchase discounts or volume transportation rates 
will produce savings greater than the increased variable costs involved 
in procurement and possession, the economic purchase quantity (EPQ) 
principle shall be used as described in the GSA Handbook. The Economic 
Order Quantity Principle and Applications.

Sec. 101-27.103  Acquisition of excess property.

    Except for inventories eligible for return to GSA for credit 
pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 101-27.501 and for inventories for 
which an economic retention limit has been established in accordance 
with the provisions of subpart 101-27.3 of this part, inventory levels 
may be adjusted upward when items of stock are to be acquired from 
excess sources. Such adjustments should be tempered by caution and 
arrived at after careful consideration. Generally, acquisitions of items 
for inventory from excess sources shall not exceed a 2-year supply 
except when:
    (a) A greater quantity is needed to meet known requirements for an 
authorized planned program.
    (b) The item is not available without special manufacture and a 
predictable requirement exists.
    (c) Administrative determination has been made that in application 
of the EOQ principle of stock replenishment within an agency an 
inventory level in excess of 2 years is appropriate for low dollar-
volume items.
    (d) The items are being transferred into authorized stock funds for 
resale to other Government agencies.

          Subpart 101-27.2--Management of Shelf-Life Materials


<R05>
Sec. 101-27.201  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart provides for the identification, designation of useful 
life, and establishment of controls for shelf-life items to minimize 
loss and insure maximum use prior to deterioration. A shelf-life item is 
any item possessing deteriorative or unstable characteristics to the 
degree that a storage period must be assigned to assure the issuance of 
material that will perform satisfactorily in service.
[32 FR 6493, Apr. 27, 1967]


<R05>
Sec. 101-27.202  Applicability.

    This subpart 101-27.2 is applicable to all executive agencies except 
the Department of Defense. The principles and objectives prescribed in 
this subpart are in consonance with those adopted by the Department of 
Defense in the establishment of shelf-life procedures for use by 
military activities.
[32 FR 6493, Apr. 27, 1967]


<R05>
Sec. 101-27.203  Program objectives.

    In order to assure maximum use of shelf-life items, each executive 
agency shall:
    (a) Identify shelf-life items, including any new items to be placed 
in inventory, which have a limited shelf-life period.
    (b) Establish the shelf-life period of such items and procedures for 
controlling their procurement, storage, and issue.
    (c) Inspect or test certain shelf-life items prior to deterioration 
to determine if the shelf-life period can be extended.
    (d) Conduct inventory management analyses to determine if shelf-life 
stocks are expected to be utilized prior to the expiration of the 
original or any extended shelf-life period, and, if not, arrange for 
transfer of such stock in

[[Page 317]]

sufficient time to permit usage prior to deterioration.
    (e) Make available for Government-wide distribution, through excess 
property channels, any stocks which cannot be utilized through normal 
supply channels.
[32 FR 6493, Apr. 27, 1967]


<R05>
Sec. 101-27.204  Types of shelf-life items.

    Shelf-life items are classified as nonextendable (Type I) and 
extendable (Type II). Type I items have a definite storage life after 
which the item or material is considered to be no longer usable for its 
primary function and should be discarded. Type II items are those for 
which successive reinspection dates can be established when the items 
have a continued usability as determined by examination based upon 
criteria that have been agreed upon. Examples of Type I items are drugs 
and medicines with certain characteristics. Examples of Type II items 
are paint and ink.
[40 FR 59595, Dec. 29, 1975]


<R05>
Sec. 101-27.205  Shelf-life codes.

    Shelf-life items shall be identified by use of a one-digit code to 
provide for uniform coding of shelf-life materials by all agencies.
    (a) The code designators for shelf-life periods of up to 60 months 
are as follows:

 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                Type II

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Code designator 0 is used to identify items not included in a 
shelf-life program.
    (c) Code designator X shall be used to identify critical end-use 
items, military essential items, and medical items with a shelf life 
greater than 60 months. Agencies shall establish controls for such 
materials to prevent issuance of any unserviceable items.
    (d) Agencies may also establish controls for materials with a shelf 
life greater than 60 months that are not identified in paragraph (c) of 
this section. Such controls should be established only when they are 
necessary for effective management of the items.

Sec. 101-27.206  Procurement of shelf-life materials.


<R05>
Sec. 101-27.206-1  General considerations.

    In determining requirements for shelf-life items, the following 
elements should be taken into consideration:
    (a) Assigned storage time periods; and
    (b) Appropriate contracting techniques for the particular item 
involved, including specification requirements, industry practices, and 
storage and delivery procedures.
[40 FR 59595, Dec. 29, 1975]


<R05>
Sec. 101-27.206-2  Identification and shipping requirements.

    Manufacturers shall, whenever practicable, be required to mark the 
unit or container with the month and year of manufacture or production 
and the batch number on all shelf-life items (60 months or less) 
procured from other than GSA sources. Whenever practical, the supplier 
shall be required to ship or deliver material within a given number of 
months from the date of manufacture or production. These ``age on 
delivery'' requirements should not be imposed in such a manner as to 
unduly restrict competition at any trade level. The following guidelines 
are suggested as appropriate for most shelf-life items:

 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
             Shelf-life period                     Age on delivery
------------------------------------------------------------------------
25 mos. or more...........................  6 mos.

<R05>
Sec. 101-27.207  Control and inspection.


<R05>
Sec. 101-27.207-1  Agency controls.

    Agencies shall establish the necessary controls to identify shelf-
life items on their stock records (and in other appropriate elements of 
their supply system), and shall determine the appropriate shelf life for 
other than GSA managed items. Shelf-life items shall be stored in such a 
way as to ensure that the oldest stock on hand is issued first. Agencies 
shall issue the oldest stock of shelf-life items first except when it is 
not feasible as in shipments to overseas activities.
[40 FR 59596, Dec. 29, 1975]


<R05>
Sec. 101-27.207-2  Inspection.

    Type II items remaining in stock immediately before the end of the 
designated shelf-life period shall be inspected to determine whether the 
shelf life can be extended, except items having a line item inventory 
value of $300 or less, or if the cost of inspection or testing is 
significant in relation to the value of the item. If the material is 
found suitable for issue on the date of inspection, the shelf life 
should be extended for a period equal to 50 percent of the original 
shelf-life period and the next reinspection date established 
accordingly. Material should be reinspected before the end of each 
extended shelf-life period and the shelf life extended again up to 50 
percent of the original shelf life as long as the material conforms to 
the established criteria. Material on which the shelf life has been 
extended shall not be shipped to overseas activities if the time 
remaining in the extended shelf-life period is relatively short.
[40 FR 59596, Dec. 29, 1975]


<R05>
Sec. 101-27.207-3  Marking material to show extended shelf life.

    When the shelf-life period of Type II material (except for critical 
end-use items as described below) is extended, only the exterior 
containers of bulk stocks need be annotated or labeled to indicate the 
date of inspection and date material is to be reinspected. Individual 
units of issue not classified as having a critical end-use application 
are not required to be annotated or labeled as long as controls are 
established to preclude issuance of unserviceable material to a user. (A 
critical end-use item is any item which is essential to the preservation 
of life in emergencies; e.g., parachutes, marine life preservers, and 
certain drug products, or any item which is essential to the performance 
of a major system; e.g., aircraft, the failure of which would cause 
damage to the system or endanger personnel.) At the time of shipment, 
the date of inspection and date for reinspection shall be affixed by 
label or marked by other means on each unit of issue of Type II items 
having a critical end-use application.
[42 FR 61861, Dec. 7, 1977]


<R05>
Sec. 101-27.208  Inventory analyses.

    (a) An inventory analysis shall be conducted periodically for each 
Type I item to determine whether the quantity on hand will be used 
within the established shelf-life period. If the analysis indicates 
there are quantities which will not be used within the shelf-life 
period, arrangements shall be made to ensure use of the item(s) within 
the holding agency or for redistribution to other agencies.
    (b) An inventory analysis shall be conducted periodically for each 
Type II item with a shelf life of 60 months or less to determine whether 
issue of the quantity on hand is anticipated prior to the expiration of 
the designated shelf life. This analysis shall be made as follows:

 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
            Shelf-life period                    Date of analysis
------------------------------------------------------------------------
48 to 60 mos............................  12 to 16 mo. prior to

                                           expiration.
Up to 6 mos.............................  No analysis required, but
                                           special emphasis should be

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) If the analysis indicates that the quantity on hand will not be 
issued within the shelf-life period and the cost of inspection or 
testing is not significant in relation to the line item value, the items 
shall be inspected to determine if the shelf-life period can be 
extended.
    (2) If the analysis indicates that the quantity on hand will be 
issued within the shelf-life period, inspection is not required. 
However, such items shall be viewed again during the last month of the 
shelf-life period to determine whether quantities are sufficient to 
warrant inspection. The guidelines in Sec. 101-27.207-2 shall be used to 
determine whether quantities are sufficient to warrant inspection and 
for extending the shelf-life period.
    (3) If an agency does not have an inspection capability and the 
quantity and value of an indicated overage is sufficiently large to 
warrant special consideration, arrangements shall be made for qualified 
inspection or laboratory testing to determine whether the material is 
suitable for issue.

<R05>
Sec. 101-27.303  Reducing long supply.

    Through effective interagency matching of material and requirements 
before the material becomes excess, unnecessary procurements and 
investment losses can be reduced. Timely action is required to reduce 
inventories to their normal stock levels by curtailing procurement and 
by utilizing and redistributing long supply. (The term long supply means 
the increment of inventory of an item that exceeds the stock level 
criteria established for that item by the inventory manager, but 
excludes quantities to be declared excess.) In this connection, 
requirements for agency managed items should be obtained from long 
supply inventories offered by agencies rather than by procurement from 
commercial sources. Because supply requirements usually fluctuate over a 
period of time, a long supply quantity which is 10 percent or less of 
the total stock of the item is

[[Page 320]]

considered marginal and need not be reduced.
[41 FR 3858, Jan. 27, 1976]


<R05>
Sec. 101-27.303-1  Cancellation or transfer.

    When the long supply of an item, including quantities due in from 
procurement, is greater than 10 percent of the total stock of that item, 
the inventory manager, or other appropriate official, shall cancel or 
curtail any outstanding requisitions or procurements on which award has 
not been made for such items, and may also cancel contracts for such 
items (if penalty charges would not be incurred) or transfer the long 
supply, if economical, to other offices within the agency in accordance 
with agency utilization procedures. In such cases, acquisition of long 
supply items shall not be made from other sources such as requirements 
contracts.


<R05>
Sec. 101-27.303-2  Redistribution.

    If the long supply of an item remains greater than 10 percent of the 
total stock of an item despite efforts to cancel or transfer the long 
supply as provided in Sec. 101-27.303-1, the inventory manager shall 
offer the long supply to another agency or other agencies in accordance 
with this Sec. 101-27.303-2. Before offering a long supply to any 
agency, the inventory manager shall determine whether the item to be 
offered is a centrally managed item or an agency managed item. A 
centrally managed item is an item of supply or equipment which forms 
part of an inventory of an agency performing a mission of storage and 
distribution to other Government activities; e.g., GSA and DSA. An 
agency managed item is a procured item that forms a part of a controlled 
inventory of an agency and its activities for issue internally for its 
own use. After determining whether the item to be offered is an agency 
or centrally managed item, the inventory manager shall:
    (a) Offer centrally managed items to the agency managing the item 
for return and credit in accordance with the procedures established by 
that agency; and
    (b) Offer agency managed items to other agencies which manage the 
same item. Reimbursement shall be arranged by the agencies effecting the 
inventory transfer. The responsibility of locating agencies or 
activities requiring these items shall rest with the agency holding the 
long supply. However, agencies may receive a list of Government 
activities using particular national stock numbers by writing to the 
General Services Administration (FFL), Washington, DC 20406.

Sec. 101-27.304  Criteria for economic retention limits.

    If a long supply continues to exceed 10 percent of the total stock 
of an item despite efforts to redistribute the long supply as provided 
in Sec. 101-27.303-2, the inventory manager shall establish an economic 
retention limit for the item in accordance with the provisions of this 
Sec. 101-27.304. An economic retention limit is the maximum quantity of 
an item that can be held in stock without incurring greater costs for 
carrying the stock than the costs for disposal and resulting loss of 
investment. The economic retention limit shall be used to determine 
which portion of the inventory may be economically retained and which 
portion should be disposed of as excess.
[41 FR 3858, Jan. 27, 1976]


<R05>
Sec. 101-27.304-1  Establishment of economic retention limit.

    An economic retention limit must be established for inventories so 
that the Government will not incur any more than the minimum necessary 
costs to provide stock of an item at the time it is required. Generally, 
it would be more economical to dispose of stock in excess of the limit 
and procure stock again at a future time when the need is more proximate 
rather than incur the cumulative carrying costs.
    (a) The agency managing a centrally managed or agency managed item 
shall establish an economic retention limit so that the total cumulative 
cost of carrying a stock of the item (including interest on the capital 
that is tied up in the accumulated carrying costs) will be no greater 
than the reacquisition cost of the stock (including the procurement or 
order cost). Consideration

[[Page 321]]

should be given to any significant net return that might be realized 
from present disposal of the stock. Where no information has been 
issued, the net return from disposal is assumed to be zero. Guidelines 
for setting stock retention limits are provided in the following table 
and explanatory remarks that follow:

 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                       Economic retention limit in years of supply--net

Note: The entries in the tables were calculated by determining how long
  an item must be carried in inventory before the total cumulative
  carrying costs (including interest on the additional funds that would
  be tied up in the accumulated annual carrying costs) would exceed the
  acquisition costs of the stock. at that time (reacquisition costs).
  For example, assuming no net return from disposal, the accumulated
  carrying costs computed at the rate of 25 percent per year on the
  reacquisition cost of the stock and compounded annually at 10 percent
  (GSA's recommended rate of interest on Government investments) would
  be:

At 25 percent a year, accumulated carrying costs would be equivalent to 
the reacquisition costs after 3\1/2\ years. Three and one-half years is, 
therefore, the economic retention limit for items with a 25 percent 
annual carrying cost rate. Where an activity has not yet established an 
estimate of its carrying cost, an annual rate of 10 percent may be used 
as an interim rate thereby resulting in an economic retention limit of 
7\1/4\ years when the net return on disposal is zero. The elements of 
carrying (holding) cost are given in the GSA Handbook, The Economic 
Order Quantity Principle and Applications. The handbook is listed in the 
GSA Supply Catalog and may be ordered in the same manner as other items 
in the catalog.
    (b) The economic retention limit at a user stocking activity can 
best be determined by the item manager (for centrally managed or agency 
managed items) on the basis of overall Government requirements and 
planned procurement. Since stocks in long supply at a user stocking 
activity are less likely to find utilization outlets, the retention 
limit at these activities should be relatively small. Generally the 
economic retention limit at a user stocking activity should be computed 
in the same manner as in paragraph (a) of this section and then reduced 
by 70 percent.
[39 FR 27902, Aug. 2, 1974]


<R05>
Sec. 101-27.304-2  Factors affecting the economic retention limit.

    (a) The economic retention limit may be increased where:
    (1) The item is of special manufacture and relates to an end item of 
equipment which is expected to be in use beyond the economic retention 
time limit; or
    (2) Costs incident to holding an additional quantity are 
insignificant and obsolescence and deterioration of an item are 
unlikely.
    (b) The economic retention limit should be reduced under the 
following conditions:
    (1) The related end item of equipment is being phased out or an 
interchangeable item is available; or
    (2) The item has limited storage life, is likely to become obsolete, 
or the age and condition of the item does not justify the full retention 
limit.


<R05>
Sec. 101-27.305  Disposition of long supply.

    Where efforts to reduce the inventory below the economic retention 
limit have been unsuccessful, appropriate disposition should be effected 
in accordance with subpart 101-43.3 of this chapter. Any remaining 
inventory which is within the economic retention limit shall be 
retained. However, the item shall be reviewed at least annually and 
efforts made to reduce the long supply inventory in accordance with 
Sec. 101-27.303.

    Source: 32 FR 12401, Aug. 25, 1967, and 32 FR 12721, Sept. 2, 1967, 
unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 101-27.400  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart establishes policy and procedures designed to assure 
that items which can be obtained more economically from readily 
available sources, Government or commercial, are eliminated from 
inventory. For items which are not readily available from Government or 
commercial sources or are being held in inventory for a one time 
construction project, this subpart shall be applied to the extent 
feasible by the activity managing or controlling such inventories.


<R05>
Sec. 101-27.401  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 101-27.402  Applicability.

    The provisions of this subpart are applicable to all executive 
agencies in connection with inventory items maintained at stocking 
activities other than Government wholesale supply sources.


<R05>
Sec. 101-27.403  General.

    By eliminating inactive items and slow-moving items which are 
readily available, when needed, from Government wholesale supply 
activities or from commercial sources, the costs to the Government in 
inventory investment and for maintaining the items in inventory can be 
eliminated. An ``inactive item'' is an item for which no current or 
future requirements are recognized by previous users and the item 
manager. A ``slow-moving item'' is an item for which there are current 
or future requirements, but the frequency and quantity of such 
requirements do not make it economical to stock them in lieu of 
obtaining requirements from other sources when needed. However, 
``standby or reserve items'' are not to be eliminated from inventories. 
A ``standby or reserve item'' is an item for which a reserve stock is 
held so that the items will be available immediately to meet emergencies 
for which there is insufficient time to procure or requisition the items 
without endangering life or causing substantial financial loss to the 
Government.
[41 FR 3859, Jan. 27, 1976]


<R05>
Sec. 101-27.404  Review of items.

    Except for standby or reserve stocks, items in inventory shall be 
reviewed periodically (at least annually) to identify those which are 
inactive and slow-moving. This review may be conducted coincidently with 
the normal replenishment or long supply reviews. The estimate of current 
or future requirements for an item shall be based on its recent history 
of recurring requirements. Standby items shall also be reviewed at 
appropriate intervals to substantiate their qualification for inclusion 
in that category.


<R05>
Sec. 101-27.405  Criteria for elimination.

    Inactive items, items which no longer qualify as standby, and slow-
moving items which are readily available, when needed, from Government 
or commercial sources shall be eliminated from inventory. The 
determination of a slow-moving item shall be based on a comparison of 
the costs for continuing to maintain it in stock as opposed to the costs 
for ordering it from outside sources each time it is requested. This 
comparison shall also consider any difference in price and 
transportation costs for each alternative. In the absence of criteria 
for stockage of an item developed and used by an agency, the desired 
results will be obtained through application of the following table:

  frequency under EOQ. For example, an item ordered six times per year
  under EOQ should have at least 12 requests per year to continue
  stockage. For 11 requests, it would cost less to order each time it

Sec. 101-27.406  Disposition of stock.

    Stocks of slow-moving items which are not otherwise determined to be 
eligible for continued stockage shall be eliminated through normal 
attrition and shall not be replenished. The successive actions indicated 
in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, shall be taken, as 
necessary, to remove stocks of inactive items from inventory.
    (a) Transfer stock to other offices where needed within the agency.
    (b) Transfer stock to other agencies as follows:
    (1) Centrally managed items to the agency managing the item for 
credit; or
    (2) Agency program items to agencies requiring them.
    (c) Dispose of remaining stocks, as excess, after actions taken in 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, in accordance with subpart 101-

<R05>
Sec. 101-27.501  Eligibility for return.

    GSA stock items for which no current or future agency requirements 
are anticipated are eligible for return to GSA for credit. Despite 
eligibility for return to GSA, consideration should be given to the 
transportation costs involved as related to the value of the items, and, 
where excessive, such items shall not be reported to GSA.


<R05>
Sec. 101-27.502  Criteria for return.

    Any GSA stock item to be returned to GSA by an agency which has no 
current or future requirements for that item shall meet the following 
conditions:
    (a) The minimum dollar value per line item, based on the current GSA 
selling price, shall be:
    (1) $130 for hand tools, FSG 51, and measuring tools, FSG 52; and
    (2) $450 for items in all other Federal supply groups and classes 
except for tires and tubes, FSC 2610; tool kits, FSC 5180; laboratory 
supplies, FSCs 6630 and 6640; Standard forms, FSC 7540; paints, dopes,

<R05>
Sec. 101-27.503  Allowable credit.

    Allowable credit for activities returning material that is accepted 
by GSA will be reflected in billings by GSA and will be commensurate 
with the condition of the material received.
    (a) Credit will be granted at the rate of 80 percent of the current 
GSA selling price after acceptance by GSA for new,

[[Page 324]]

used, repaired, or reconditioned material which is serviceable and 
issuable to all agencies without limitation or restriction (condition 
code A).
    (b) Credit will be granted at the rate of 60 percent of the current 
GSA selling price for items which involve limited expenses or effort to 
restore to serviceable condition, and which is accomplished in the 
storage activity where the stock is located (e.g., a deficiency in 
packing or packaging which restricts the issue or requires repacking or 
repackaging (condition code E)).
    (c) No credit will be given for material returned to GSA which does 
not meet the above criteria or which was returned to GSA without prior 
approval.

<R05>
Sec. 101-27.504  Notice to GSA.

    When an activity elects to offer material to GSA for credit, the 
activity shall submit offers in accordance with chapter 4 of the 
FEDSTRIP Operating Guide or chapter 9 of MILSTRIP (DoD 4000.25-1-M).
[56 FR 11939, Mar. 21, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 101-27.505  Notice to activity.

    GSA will provide notice to the offering activity of an acceptance/
rejection decision for an offer and verification of material receipt for 
accepted offers.
    (a) Within 20 workdays after receipt of an offer to return material, 
GSA will notify the offering activity of acceptance or rejection of the 
offer.
    (1) For accepted offers, GSA will inform the offering activity of 
the GSA material return facility (storage activity) to which the 
material shall be shipped. Prior to shipment of the material authorized 
by GSA for return, activities shall verify the declared condition. (If 
the offering activity considers that the transportation costs of sending 
the material to the GSA material return facility are excessive in 
relation to the value of the material and withdraws the offers, the GSA 
region that was designated to receive the offered material shall be 
notified accordingly.)
    (2) For rejected offers, GSA will so inform the activity offering 
the material and give the reason for nonacceptance.
    (b) Upon receipt of material authorized for return by GSA, the 
offering activity will be provided verification of receipt and a report 
of any discrepancies. When the discrepant condition is attributable to 
carrier negligence, subsequent credit allowed by GSA will be reduced by 
the amount to be paid the agency by the carrier for any damages 
incurred. A notice of credit will be provided the offering activity 
through credit entries on the monthly billing statement from the 
supporting GSA finance center.
    (c) When offers of material that have been authorized by GSA for 
return are withdrawn, offering activities shall report such cancellation 
to the GSA region that was designated to receive the offered material.

<R05>
Sec. 101-27.506  Determination of acceptability for credit.

    Returned material will be examined by GSA upon receipt to determine 
acceptability for credit. Returned material which is unacceptable for 
credit will be deemed to have been declared excess by the returning 
activity, and will be disposed of by GSA as excess or surplus in the 
name of the activity, in accordance with part 101-43 of this chapter. 
The returning activity will be officially notified of the disposal 
action taken by GSA.


<R05>
Sec. 101-27.507  Transportation and other costs.

    Transportation costs for the movement of material to GSA and 
handling costs for preparation and shipment shall be paid by the

   Subpart 101-28.2--Interagency Cross-Servicing in Storage Activities


<R05>
Sec. 101-28.200  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart prescribes policies and procedures to be followed in 
the cross-servicing of storage and warehousing services between 
executive agencies of the Government. It implements the provisions of 
the cross-servicing agreement between the Department of Defense (DOD) 
and GSA and extends the provisions of the agreement to provide cross-
servicing between the civilian agencies of the Government.
[29 FR 15998, Dec. 1, 1964]


<R05>
Sec. 101-28.201  Applicability.

    (a) The policies and procedures established by this subpart 101-28.2 
are primarily applicable to storage activities within the United States. 
Executive agencies shall make every effort to utilize available 
Government storage services of other executive agencies to avoid new 
construction of storage facilities, acquisition of temporary space, and 
unnecessary transportation of supplies, material, and equipment to 
distant storage points. Whenever feasible, the policies and procedures 
shall be used to cross-service storage and warehousing requirements in 
overseas storage activities. Available storage services of executive 
agencies shall be made available for cross-servicing the requirements of 
other Federal agencies when requested. Other Federal agencies are 
encouraged to participate in cross-servicing arrangements.
    (b) The provisions of this subpart 101-28.2 do not apply to ocean 
terminals, Government storage activities financed under industrial 
funds, activities concerned with the storage and handling of bulk fuels 
(petroleum products), and storage functions performed by GSA for the 
Federal Preparedness Agency.

<R05>
Sec. 101-28.202-2  Cancellation of cross-servicing arrangements.

    (a) Accepted requests may be canceled by the requesting agency prior 
to delivery of supplies, material, and equipment to the storage activity 
when logistical developments make cancellation necessary or cancellation 
is in the best interest of the Government. The agency which accepted the 
request shall be informed of the cancellation in writing as soon as 
possible.
    (b) Cancellation of arrangements in facilities to be inactivated or 
disposed of by an operating agency may be made as provided for in the 
GSA/DOD agreement. Also, after supplies, material, and equipment have 
been received at a storage activity, cancellation may be made when 
unforeseen emergencies arise which justify such cancellation. Advice of 
these necessary cancellations shall be in writing to the agency owning 
the material sufficiently in advance to allow the owning agency the 
maximum amount of time to make other arrangements for their property.
    (c) When a facility in which cross-servicing is being accomplished 
is to be transferred from an operating agency to another agency, the 
operating agency shall inform the agency owning the property at least 90 
days before the transfer. The agency owning the property shall negotiate 
with the agency gaining the facility for continued cross-servicing of 
the property at the facility. The agency gaining the facility shall 
continue the cross-servicing arrangements unless they are contrary to 
the best interest of the Government.
[42 FR 2317, Jan. 11, 1977]


<R05>
Sec. 101-28.202-3  Cross-servicing rates.

    Normally, charges for services rendered will be based upon the 
standard rates established by the agency for internal use. However, 
special rates may be negotiated to cover actual or estimated costs for 
large, bulk lots of material when the applicable rates appear 
inequitable, subject to the approval of the appropriate program official 
for the civilian agency, and the Assistant Secretary of Defense (I and 
L) when DOD is involved.
[42 FR 2317, Jan. 11, 1977]


<R05>
Sec. 101-28.202-4  Reimbursement for services.

    Reimbursement for services rendered shall be made promptly after 
receipt of billing. The frequency for billing and reimbursement shall be 
established by the activity providing warehousing and storage services; 
however, billing and reimbursement shall be made not less frequently 
than quarterly nor more frequently than monthly.

<R05>
Sec. 101-28.304  Item selection and stockage criteria.


<R05>
Sec. 101-28.304-1  Types of items.

    Items stocked in customer supply centers are based on customer 
agency requirements for common use expendable items. In addition to 
administrative type items commonly used in Government offices, 
janitorial supplies, handtools, and other industrial-type items are 
stocked when required to meet the mission-related needs of the 
activities supported by the CSC.


<R05>
Sec. 101-28.304-2  Determining items to be stocked.

    (a) Each CSC will stock administrative items normally required by 
Federal agencies for day-to-day operations. In addition to those items, 
each CSC will stock additional items as determined by the requirements 
of the activities within the geographic area it serves.
    (b) Regional FSS offices will canvass customer agencies periodically 
to identify items for which there is an official need within their 
support area.
    (c) Customer agencies may request that specific items be stocked by 
their support CSC. The requests must be submitted in writing to the 
appropriate-FSS Bureau Director and must be signed by a customer agency 
official at a level of responsibility (division director or higher) 
acceptable to the GSA Regional Administrator. All requests must indicate 
the expected monthly usage of the item requested. Each request will be 
evaluated and the submitting activity notified of the results of the 
evaluation.


<R05>
Sec. 101-28.305  Prices of customer supply center items.

    The selling price of a CSC item is an average price which is 
calculated automatically by the CSC computer at the time the item is 
ordered. Items stocked in CSCs that are obtained from GSA

[[Page 328]]

wholesale supply distribution facilities are input into the computer at 
the price in effect at the time of shipment from the facilities (this 
price is normally the price shown in the GSA Supply Catalog). Items 
stocked in CSCs that are not available from GSA wholesale supply 
distribution facilities but which are obtained from other Government 
supply sources or commercial sources are input into the computer at the 
invoice cost. Due to cost averaging, item prices listed in the CSC 
catalog may differ somewhat from the sale price for a particular 
transaction.


<R05>
Sec. 101-28.306  Customer supply center (CSC) accounts and related controls.


<R05>
Sec. 101-28.306-1  Establishment of a CSC account by a customer activity.

    (a) Eligible agencies should contact the GSA Regional Federal Supply 
Service Bureau to obtain full information on the use of the CSC for 
their locale. FSS Bureau personnel will provide assistance to agencies 
in the establishment of the CSC account, brief personnel on the use of 
the CSC to meet local, retail supply requirements, and provide copies of 
the CSC catalog.
    (b) An appropriate level management official (division director of 
higher) authorized to obligate agency funds must sign the GSA Form 3525, 
Application for Customer Supply Services, requesting establishment of 
the CSC account for the activity.


<R05>
Sec. 101-28.306-2  Use of customer supply centers.

    (a) Orders are received by the CSC via phone, mail, electronic mail, 
or in person on a walk-in basis for urgent agency requirements. All use 
of the CSC is based upon the customer access code assigned at the time 
of establishment of the activity account. The customer access code 
determines the ship-to point for orders placed with the CSC. The ship-to 
point cannot be changed, one established, except by the submission of a 
written request signed by an appropriate agency official.
    (b) All orders placed with the CSC, except emergency pickup orders, 
described in Sec. 101-28.306-1(c), will be shipped to the activity 
placing the order via mail or small parcel carrier not later than the 
end of the next business day.
    (c) Walk-in orders for urgent requirements are accepted and filled 
immediately provided the individual placing the order has proper 
identification. Telephone orders placed in the morning may be picked up 
in the afternoon of the same day provided that the individual picking up 
the order possesses proper identification and the order ticket number 
provided by the CSC personnel at the time the order is placed.


<R05>
Sec. 101-28.306-3  Limitations on use.

    (a) Agencies shall establish internal controls to ensure that the 
use of the CSC account by the agency or other authorized activities is 
limited to the purchase of items for official Government use. The 
controls shall include written instructions that contain a statement 
prohibiting the use of the CSC account in acquiring items for other than 
Government use. When an agency makes a purchase of more than $500 per 
line item from a GSA customer supply center which is other than a 
similar lowest priced item available from a multiple-award schedule, GSA 
will assume that a justification has been prepared and made a part of 
the buying agency's purchase file. Availability of products, regardless 
of the total amount of the line item price, does not relieve an agency 
of the responsibility to select the lowest priced item commensurate with 
needs of the agency.
    (b) Office supplies needed by Members of Congress and the Delegate 
of the District of Columbia for use in their offices in the House or 
Senate Office Buildings should be obtained from the Senate and Houses 
Representatives supply rooms, as appropriate. Members of Congress, 
except for the Delegate of the District of Columbia, should limit their 
use of the CSCs to those located outside of the District of Columbia. 
The Delegate of the District of Columbia may obtain office supplies for 
the use of his or her district offices from the CSC serving the District 
of Columbia.

[[Page 329]]


<R05>
Sec. 101-28.306-4  Expiration or cancellation.

    (a) CSC accounts established for Federal agencies or members of the 
Federal judiciary are valid for an indefinite period of time unless 
canceled by the Commissioner, FSS, GSA, or by a GSA Regional 
Administrator.
    (b) CSC accounts established for authorized contractors or Members 
of Congress will contain an expiration date reflecting the termination 
date of the contract or term of office. New accounts will be established 
for reinstated contractors or reelected Members of Congress upon 
submission of a new application.
    (c) Any CSC customer may request cancellation of his/her account 
when no longer required or whenever there is cause to believe that the 
customer access code has been compromised. Agencies shall keep GSA 
advised of any changes in organization or accounting structures that 
might have an impact on their CSC accounts.
    (d) The Commissioner FSS, GSA, may periodically direct a nationwide 
purge of all CSC accounts to cancel those that are duplicates, not 
needed, or for which the customer access code has been compromised. 
Selective account cancellations may be directed by the GSA Regional 
Administrator in coordination with FSS Central Office. Under the 
procedures of a nationwide purge, CSC accounts become invalid as of a 
specific date established by the Commissioner, FSS, GSA, or by a 
Regional Administrator, and new CSC accounts are established upon 
receipt of new applications.


<R05>
Sec. 101-28.306-5  Safeguards.

    Agencies shall establish internal controls to ensure that the 
customer access codes assigned for their accounts are properly 
protected. It is by use of these access codes that orders are accepted 
by the CSC and these codes determine the ship-to points for all orders 
filled by the CSC with the exception of orders picked up at the CSC by 
the customer. GSA will not change the ship-to location associated with 
the customer access code except upon receipt of a written request to do 
so, signed by a duly authorized official of the customer activity.


<R05>
Sec. 101-28.306-6  Sensitive items.

    Many items stocked by the CSCs may be considered sensitive based 
upon standard criteria factors such as propensity for personal use, the 
potential for embarrassment of GSA and customer agencies, the level of 
customer complaints, and control as an accountable item of personal 
property. Each customer activity shall take all appropriate measures 
necessary to ensure that all items are properly controlled within its 
activity and are purchased solely for official Government use.


<R05>
Sec. 101-28.306-7  Responsibility for operation.

    The GSA Regional Administrator is responsible for the operation of 
any CSCs located within his or her region.

Federal product descriptions. They are developed by GSA or other Federal 
agencies under the Assigned Agency Plan described in the ``Federal 
Standardization Handbook'' issued by the Assistant Administrator for 
Federal Supply and Services (FSS). Product descriptions are coordinated 
with other Federal agencies having technical, statutory, or regulatory 
interest in the commodity or other subject matter covered. Generally, 
before they are issued, Federal product descriptions are reviewed by 
technical societies, individual industrial producers, and organizations 
representing industrial producers and consumers.


<R05>
Sec. 101-29.102  Use of metric system of measurement in Federal product descriptions.

    In accordance with Public Law 94-168, 15 U.S.C. 205b, the 
Administrator of General Services shall develop procedures and plan for 
the increasing use of metric products by requiring Federal agencies to:
    (a) Maintain close liaison with other Federal agencies, State and 
local governments, and the private sector on metric matters, and
    (b) Review, prepare, and revise Federal standardization documents to 
eliminate barriers to the procurement of metric goods and services. 
These actions will occur during the overage document review or when the 
agency is informed by the private sector that metric products can be 
produced in a specific Federal supply classification class.

Sec. 101-30.401  Data available from the Federal Catalog System.

    Federal Catalog System data are available in publications of general 
interest to Government supply activities and in the form of automated 
output tailored to meet individual agency needs.
[42 FR 36255, July 14, 1977]


<R05>
Sec. 101-30.401-1  Publications providing Federal catalog data.

    (a) Federal Catalog System publications contain selected data from 
the Defense Logistics Services Center (DLSC) files chosen, assembled, 
and formatted to meet recognized needs for information in support of 
assigned missions, functions, and related responsibilities. Most 
publications are produced in microfiche form; however, some are produced 
in hard copy form. The following publications are available:
    (1) Master cross-reference list. A microfiche publication which 
contains a master list of national stock numbers (NSN's) cross-
referenced to and from manufacturers' part numbers, specifications, or 
reference drawings. This publication is used to cross-relate reference 
numbers and stock numbers or to ascertain the manufacturer of an

[[Page 343]]

item when the reference number or the NSN is known.
    (2) Identification list (IL). A microfiche publication arranged by 
Federal supply class and containing descriptions of items in the DLSC 
file. The principal uses of the IL are to obtain or verify an NSN when 
only the characteristics of the item are known or descriptive data when 
the NSN is known, and to determine interchangeable or substitutable 
items.
    (3) Consolidated Management Listing. A microfiche publication which 
is a consolidated listing of NSN's and related supply management data of 
each integrated manager and military service. These data include 
Government source of supply, unit of issue, unit price, etc.
    (4) Federal item logistics data records (FILDR). A microfiche 
publication containing complete identification data in tabular format 
for all descriptive-type item identifications. The data are arranged in 
NSN sequence within Federal supply class. An FILDR is known in hard copy 
form as a DD-146 card which is furnished as an output to authorized 
receivers of Federal catalog data who cannot use other available output 
media.
    (5) Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Federal Supply Catalog for Civil 
Agencies. This publication (available in hard copy only) includes NSN's 
for which DLA is the single source of supply for civil agencies. These 
NSN's may not necessarily have a DOD user recorded. The publication 
contains descriptive and management data for items not usually listed in 
the GSA catalog but which might be required by civil agencies.
    (b) Agencies may obtain without charge copies of the DLA Federal 
Supply Catalog for Civil Agencies, described in paragraph (a)(6) \1\ of 
this section by contacting the Defense Logistics Services Center, DLSC-
TP, Federal Center, Battle Creek, MI 49016. To obtain copies of the 
publications described in paragraphs (a) (1) through (5) of this 
section, agencies may submit a request in writing to the same address 
shown above, except that the applicable mail distribution code is DLSC-
AP. Information concerning the charges for the latter publications is 
available from DLSC-AP.

Sec. 101-30.401-2  Automated catalog data output.

    As a result of participation in the Federal catalog system, 
activities may receive data directly from DLSC tailored to their 
individual needs in support of their own supply management data system. 
The two basic categories of file maintenance are:
    (a) Simplified file maintenance (SFM). Subscribers to this category 
of file maintenance are provided replacement files (magnetic tape) 
semiannually containing selected technical and supply management data 
for those items on which they are a registered user. The subscriber will 
also receive a monthly maintenance update and cumulative monthly basic 
records from DLSC which may be used to maintain the simiannual basic 
file. Recipients of this form of file maintenance have latitude in 
selecting those items which meet the needs of their supply system from 
the categories of data available from the Federal Catalog System.
    (b) Regular file maintenance (RFM). This form of the file 
maintenance provides activities with data on a daily basis as 
transactions affect items upon which they are a registered user. It is 
used primarily by those activities which consider it essential to 
maintain file compatibility with the DLSC file at all times.

    As used in this subpart 101-30.7, the following terms shall have the 
meanings set forth in this Sec. 101-30.701.


<R05>
Sec. 101-30.701-1  Item reduction study.

    Item reduction study means the study of a group of generally similar 
items which are subject to evaluation by physical and performance 
characteristics. This evaluation process identifies items determined to 
be unnecessarily similar or uneconomical for Government use and which 
will be considered for removal from Government supply systems. For items 
so identified, a replacement item shall be proposed. The result of item 
reduction studies will indicate items which are authorized for 
procurement or not authorized for procurement.


<R05>
Sec. 101-30.701-2  Item standardization code.

    Item standardization code (ISC) means a code assigned an item in the 
supply system which identifies the item as authorized for procurement or 
not authorized for procurement.


<R05>
Sec. 101-30.701-3  Preparing activity.

    Preparing activity means a Government agency responsible for the 
preparation of item reduction studies, or an activity authorized by the 
listed agencies to conduct an item reduction study. The DOD 
Standardization Directory SD-1 provides such a listing.


<R05>
Sec. 101-30.701-4  Standardization relationship.

    Standardization relationship means the relationship between the 
replaced item and the replacement item. The replaced item will contain 
an item standardization code designating the item as not authorized for 
procurement and therefore must have a replacement

[[Page 348]]

item. The relationship of the two items is displayed within the item 
reduction study by item standardization codes and, upon approval of the 
study, in the Federal catalog system data base at the Defense Logistics 
Services Center (DLSC).


<R05>
Sec. 101-30.702  Determining item reduction potential.

    Item reduction studies are required where there are large numbers of 
generally similar items which are subject to grouping and examination by 
item name, item name modifiers, or other characteristics such as sizes, 
grades, lengths, and materials. Before conducting a full scale item 
reduction study, the assignee activity shall determine whether 
sufficient item reduction potential appears to exist. Item reduction 
studies shall be undertaken only when the expected benefits outweigh the 
costs of performing the study.


<R05>
Sec. 101-30.703  Program objectives.

    The objective of the item reduction program is to reduce the 
varieties and sizes of similar items in the Government supply system by:
    (a) Implementing a coordinated item reduction process among supply

<R05>
Sec. 101-30.704-1  General Services Administration.

    (a) The General Services Administration (GSA) will develop or 
authorize other Government agencies to develop item reduction studies on 
items within the Federal supply classification (FSC) classes for which 
GSA is the integrated material manager.
    (b) GSA, as the civil agency coordinating activity for item 
reduction studies originated by both GSA and DOD, will:
    (1) Distribute proposed item reduction studies, as appropriate, to 
all civil agencies recorded as users of the item in the DLSC data base. 
This distribution will be made by coordination letters in which a time 
frame for a response will be specified. GSA will interpret each 
nonresponse to a proposed study to mean that the activity concurs with 
the study. Extensions, when requested by an agency, normally will be 
granted by GSA.
    (2) Respond to questions concerning proposed item reduction studies.
    (3) Prepare a consolidated civil agency position paper (including 
comments and nonconcurrences) relative to each study upon receipt of 
user responses.
    (4) Incorporate civil agency positions into proposed item reduction 
studies prepared by GSA or forward a consolidated civil agency position 
paper to appropriate preparing activities.
    (5) Resolve controversies arising from proposed item reduction study 
recommendations.
    (6) Review approved item reduction studies to ensure that 
concurrences and nonconcurrences from all civil agencies are accurately 
reflected.
    (7) Register into the Federal catalog system, data base approved 
item reduction decisions concerning items within the FSC classes which 
are managed by GSA.
    (8) Implement decisions documented in approved item reduction 
studies within the GSA supply system.
    (9) Distribute approved item reduction studies to all recorded civil 
agency users. All civil agencies (except direct submitters of catalog 
data to DLSC) will also be forwarded covering letters which will request 
specific information relative to implementing the studies; i.e., 
inventory levels of items coded ISC 3. Activities not responding within 
the time frame specified (60 calendar days) will receive a

[[Page 349]]

followup notice before being automatically withdrawn as users of all 
items coded as not authorized for procurement.

<R05>
Sec. 101-30.704-2  Other agencies.

    Civil agencies participating in the Federal Catalog System shall:
    (a) Conduct a review of the items included in the proposed study by 
the preparing activity with respect to the ISC to determine the impact 
the assigned code may have on the agency's supply system.
    (b) Prepare and submit written comments on the proposed study to GSA 
within the time frame specified in the GSA coordination letter, concur 
with the study, or nonconcur on specific proposed standardization 
relationships. If comments cannot be prepared and submitted within the 
time frame specified, an extension shall be requested from GSA.
    (c) Review the approved item reduction study and notify GSA in 
writing if the activity is to be retained or deleted as a user of any 
item coded as ``not authorized for procurement.'' This notification will 
allow the preparer of the study to complete coordination of the study 
and update the DLSC Total Item Record (TIR).
    (d) Implement within the agency those item reduction decisions 
resulting from the study.
    (e) Request, as appropriate, the retention of a nonstandard item in 
their supply system by forwarding a letter to General Services 
Administration (FRIS), Washington, DC 20406. The request shall include 
but not be limited to the following information:
    (1) The specific end-use of end-item application;
    (2) A technical explanation comparing the physical and functional 
characteristics of the nonstandard item with each authorized-for-
procurement item;
    (3) The duration of the requirement for the item or how long the 
end-item will be retained in the agency's supply system; and
    (4) Economic considerations from a technical standpoint. GSA will 
evaluate the request and inform the agency of its acceptance or 
rejection.

<R05>
Sec. 101-31.200  Scope of subpart.

    (a) This subpart prescribes policies and procedures governing use by 
executive agencies of private organizations in discharging their 
responsibility as set forth in Sec. 1-14.102 of this title to inspect or 
arrange for the inspection of purchased supplies and services. For the 
type and extent of inspection required, see Sec. 1-14.101(b) of this

services which are not a part of an agency of the Federal Government.


<R05>
Sec. 101-31.202  Testing services.

    Testing services required to determine compliance of purchased 
supplies or services with contract requirements may be procured from 
private organizations if the situation meets all of the following 
conditions:
    (a) It has been determined by an executive agency that its personnel 
or another Federal agency cannot perform the required testing as 
efficiently or economically as a qualified private organization;
    (b) The testing services required are of a technical nature 
involving the application of scientific principles and the use of test 
equipment, gages, or special apparatus; and
    (c) The testing may be performed without direct Government 
supervision.


<R05>
Sec. 101-31.203  Inspection and grading services.

    (a) Inspection or grading, limited to an examination or careful 
scrutiny to determine from outward appearances or mechanical operation 
whether supplies or services offered by suppliers comply with contract 
requirements, is a service in which personal judgment is of major 
importance and as such shall be performed exclusively by regular 
employees of the Government under Government supervision.
    (b) Technical inspections or grading, the results of which are more 
dependent on the application of scientific principles or specialized 
techniques than the element of personal judgment, shall also be 
performed by Government employees under Government supervision except 
that a private organization may be retained to render the technical 
inspection or grading service when an executive agency determines that 
one of the following conditions exists:
    (1) The technical inspection or grading services required are of a 
specialized nature, and the agency is unable to employ the personnel 
qualified to perform the services properly or to locate another Federal 
agency capable of providing the services; or
    (2) The inspection or grading results issued by a private 
organization are essential to verify the acceptance or rejection of a 
special commodity.

[[Page 351]]


<R05>
Sec. 101-31.204  Arranging for inspection, testing, or grading by private organizations.

    (a) Inspection, testing, or grading services to be procured from a 
private organization shall be obtained in accordance with the agency's 
procurement policies and procedures subject to the following conditions:
    (1) The Government agency shall determine that the organization to 
be retained is qualified to perform expertly the required inspection, 
testing, or grading services and is professionally responsible;
    (2) Remuneration for performance of services shall be based on 
accomplishing units of work such as submission of reports on inspection, 
test, or grading results and shall not be based on time required to 
perform the services; and
    (3) The organization shall be permitted to select personnel for 
performing the services without agency direction. An agency should 
specify the type of qualifications personnel performing the services 
should possess.
    (b) When a private organization has been retained by an agency to 
perform technical inspection, testing, or grading services, information 
developed and reports issued by the organization must be evaluated and 
considered by the Government official or employee responsible for 
determining acceptability of the supplies or services.


<R05>
Sec. 101-31.205  Referral to Comptroller General.

    If an executive agency, after reviewing the requirements set forth 
in Secs. 101-31.203 and 101-31.204 has a question regarding the 
propriety of utilizing a private organization's services, a complete 
statement of the circumstances should be forwarded to the Comptroller 
General of the United States for decision prior to entering into any 
binding arrangement with a private organization for rendering the 
services.

<R05>
Sec. 101-33.301  General.

    Some Federal agencies procure public utility services from Rural 
Electrification Administration (REA)-financed cooperatives. Since REA-
financed cooperatives are nonprofit organizations, any amount paid by 
participating agencies (also referred to as patrons) in excess of cost 
of services (usually referred to as operating margins) is treated as 
capital furnished by such patrons. Operating margins are determined 
annually on a patronage basis and credited to a capital account for each 
patron. The cooperative returns the share of the net income credited to 
agencies on a revolving basis by cash payments or deductions in current 
service bills when the cooperative's board of directors determines that 
such a retirement will not impair the cooperative's financial condition.


<R05>
Sec. 101-33.302  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart 101-33.3, the following terms shall have the 
meanings stated below.


<R05>
Sec. 101-33.302-1  Capital credits.

    Capital credits are patronage dividends derived from amounts paid by 
patrons in excess of cost of services. Agencies are informed of their 
share of the capital credit, if any, by written notices of allocation 
issued by REA-financed cooperatives.


<R05>
Sec. 101-33.302-2  REA-financed cooperative.

    An REA-financed cooperative is a nonprofit organization that 
furnishes electric or telephone services to customers, including Federal 
agencies.


<R05>
Sec. 101-33.303  Responsibility for handling capital credit notifications.

    Contracting and procurement officers and other employees of Federal 
agencies shall forward promptly any capital credit notifications to 
their finance officer or other accountable official. The accountable 
official shall retain the notification in the official files of the 
agency.


<R05>
Sec. 101-33.304  Disposition of capital credit retirements.

    When capital credits are (a) settled by payment to the Government or 
(b) offset on billings to the Government, the amount received shall be 
deposited in the Department of the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts, 
or treated as a cost reduction, as appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 101-33.305  Cost-reimbursement type contracts.

    Federal agencies having cost-reimbursement type contracts with 
contractors who purchase electric or telephone service from cooperatives 
shall include in their contracts arrangements for handling capital 
credits. The applicable portion of any capital credit retirement 
relating to any allowable cost received by or accruing to a cost-
reimbursement type contractor shall be credited to the Government either

[[Page 354]]

as a cost reduction or by cash refund, as appropriate. (See Sec. 1-
15.201-5.)


<R05>
Sec. 101-33.306  Other provisions.

    (a) Capital credits shall not be waived by contract or in any other 
way.
    (b) The right to any capital credit is not lost by reason of 
subsequent discontinuance of service.

distance telephone service.


<R04>
  Subpart 101-35.2--Authorized Use of Long Distance Telephone Services


<R05>
Sec. 101-35.200  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart discusses authorized use of telephone systems and 
facilities provided, paid for, or reimbursed by the Federal Government.


<R05>
Sec. 101-35.201  Authorized use of long distance telephone services.

    (a) Scope. This section describes policies and procedures for the 
use of Government-provided and commercial long distance telephone 
service paid for by the Government.
    (b) General. Agencies should be familiar with the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) ``Guidance on the Privacy Act Implications 
of Call Detail Programs to Manage Employees' Use of the Government's 
Telecommunications Systems'' (52 FR 12990, April 20, 1987).
    (c) Policy. (1) Telephone calls placed over Government-provided and 
commercial long distance systems that will be paid for or reimbursed by 
the Government, shall be used to conduct official business only.
    (2) To the maximum extent practicable, Federal employees shall place 
calls on Government-provided long distance telephone systems and 
services instead of using commercial toll services.
    (3) In accordance with 5 CFR 2635.704, the following practices are 
prohibited and a willful violation may result in criminal, civil, or 
administrative action, including suspension or dismissal:
    (i) Use of any Government system or service, or any other telephone 
service, where the Government pays the cost of the long distance call, 
for other than official business, except emergency calls and calls the 
agency determines are necessary in the interest of the Government.
    (ii) Making an unauthorized long distance telephone call with the 
intent to later reimburse the Government.
    (iii) Unauthorized use of telephone call detail data.
    (d) Procedures. Official business calls may include emergency calls 
and other calls the agency determines are necessary in the interest of 
the Government.
    (1) Telephone calls may properly be authorized when they--
    (i) Do not adversely affect the performance of official duties by 
the employee or the employee's organization;
    (ii) Are of reasonable duration and frequency; and
    (iii) Could not reasonably have been made at another time; or
    (iv) Are provided for in a collective bargaining agreement that is 
consistent with this part.
    (2) Personal long distance calls that must be made during working 
hours may be made over the commercial long distance network if 
consistent with the criteria in paragraph (d)(1) of this section and 
are:
    (i) Charged to the employee's home phone number or other non-
Government number (third-number call);
    (ii) Made to an 800 toll-free number;
    (iii) Charged to the called party if a non-Government number 
(collect call); or
    (iv) Charged to a personal telephone credit card.
    (3) Agencies shall issue directives on using telephone facilities 
and services. Agencies' contractor-operated facilities shall be covered 
by these directives. The directives may provide further definition of 
calls necessary in the interest of the Government and shall include 
procedures for collection and reimbursement for unauthorized calls.


<R05>
Sec. 101-35.202  Collection for unauthorized use.

    (a) Agencies shall collect for any unauthorized calls if it is cost-
effective to do so. Reimbursing the Government for unauthorized calls 
does not exempt an

[[Page 357]]

employee from appropriate administrative, civil, or criminal action.
    (b) Agency collections shall include--
    (1) The value of the call, computed on the basis of commercial long 
distance rates rounded to the nearest dollar; and
    (2) An additional amount rounded to the nearest dollar to cover the 
administrative costs of determining that the call was unauthorized and 
processing the collection.

        Subpart 101-35.3--The Mandatory FTS Long Distance Network


<R05>
Sec. 101-35.300  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart describes the GSA FTS program and contracts that are 
mandatory-for-use by agencies.


<R05>
Sec. 101-35.301  The mandatory FTS long distance network.


<R05>
Sec. 101-35.301-1  General.

    (a) In accordance with section 629 of Public Law 104-52, (109 Stat. 
468, 504, November 19, 1995), executive agencies must use the FTS long 
distance network.
    (b) GSA will grant exceptions to the use of the FTS long distance 
network when:
    (1) The agency's procurement requirements are unique and cannot be 
satisfied by the FTS long distance network; and
    (2) The agency procurement would be cost-effective and would not 
adversely affect the cost-effectiveness of the FTS long distance 
network.
    (c) The FTS long distance network provides Federal agencies modern 
up-to-date intercity telecommunications services over the life of the 
program. GSA will enhance existing services and add features to the FTS 
long distance network to maintain technologically current services and 
to improve services to user agencies. GSA will make service improvements 
in accordance with agencies' needs, contract provisions, governing 
regulations and statutes.
    (d) As used in this FPMR, the terms intercity and long distance have 
the same meaning.


<R05>
Sec. 101-35.301-2  Policies.

    (a) Executive agencies shall use the FTS long distance network to 
satisfy intercity telecommunications requirements within the United 
States, Guam, Puerto Rico, or the Virgin Islands for requirements which 
are within the scope of the FTS long distance network voice, data, and 
video services as such services become available unless:
    (1) The agency requests and obtains from GSA an exception to the use 
of the FTS long distance network based on a GSA determination that:
    (i) The agency's procurement requirements are unique and cannot be 
satisfied by the FTS long distance network; and
    (ii) The agency procurement would be cost-effective and would not 
adversely affect the cost-effectiveness of the FTS long distance 
network;
    (2) The agency requests and obtains from GSA an interim exception to 
the use of the FTS long distance network based on an established date 
for transition to the FTS long distance network; or
    (3) An exception to the use of the FTS long distance network for the 
agency is otherwise provided by law.
    (b) Unless any of the exceptions listed in paragraph (a) of this 
section apply to the procurement, and when overall procurement 
requirements include any agency long distance telecommunications 
requirements which are within the scope of FTS services, executive 
agencies shall require offerors in new awards to satisfy those 
requirements by using the Government furnished services of the FTS long 
distance network as such services become available.
    (c) For ease of determining and evaluating Government costs, 
executive agencies also shall require offerors to unbundle FTS long 
distance services in their offers by separately describing and pricing 
the FTS services that satisfy Government requirements. However, the 
agency solicitation may prescribe an expected solution for the use of 
the FTS long distance network. Offerors would then be required to 
separately price the Government-furnished services of FTS only if their 
offers show a different use of FTS than the Government's expected 
solution.

[[Page 358]]

    (d) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, agencies 
may continue to use intercity telecommunications services and facilities 
provided under contracts previously authorized and awarded without 
obtaining an exception to the use of the FTS long distance network. 
However, agencies shall use available FTS long distance services that 
can satisfy their procurement requirements upon expiration of such 
contracts. Before exercising renewal options under existing contracts 
that will result in the provision of intercity telecommunications 
services, agencies shall obtain an interim exception to the use of the 
FTS long distance network. This interim exception will allow GSA and the 
agencies to plan an orderly transition to the FTS long distance network.
    (e) In planning for transition to the FTS long distance network, 
agencies shall be responsible for determining customer premises 
equipment requirements to achieve efficient interfaces with the type of 
FTS services needed. However, agencies shall avoid duplicating FTS 
services. Agencies shall avoid incorporating inherently intercity 
features (i.e., features that can be provided only as part of an 
intercity network) of the FTS long distance network in agency networks. 
An exception to the use of the FTS long distance network is hereby 
provided to agencies with requirements for non-inherently intercity 
features to satisfy such features within a local network.


<R05>
Sec. 101-35.301-3  Procedures.

    (a) GSA will provide assistance in understanding and pricing the 
services available from the FTS long distance network and in developing 
plans for transition to the FTS long distance network. For assistance 
and information concerning the FTS network, agencies should contact the 
General Services Administration, Federal Telecommunications Service (T), 
7980 Boeing Court, 4th Floor, Vienna VA, 22182-3988.
    (b) Agencies seeking an exception to the use of the FTS long 
distance network are responsible for documenting their case. A complete 
agency request for an exception to the use of the FTS long distance 
network shall establish to the satisfaction of GSA that:
    (1) The agency's procurement requirements are unique and cannot be 
satisfied by the FTS long distance network;
    (2) The agency's procurement would be cost-effective; and
    (3) The agency's procurement would not adversely affect the cost-
effectiveness of the FTS long distance network. (The rebuttable 
presumption is that, if an agency procurement requirement is unique and 
the resultant procurement would be cost-effective, the agency 
procurement would not adversely affect the cost-effectiveness of the FTS 
long distance network.)
    (c) An agency request for an interim exception to the use of the FTS 
long distance network shall be based on a GSA established date for 
transition of agency requirements to the FTS long distance network.
    (d) Any agency exception request shall be sent to the General 
Services Administration/Federal Telecommunications Service (T).
    (e) Agencies may conduct procurements for long distance 
telecommunications services and facilities without prior approval of GSA 
when the agency's requirements are within the scope of an exception to 
the use of the FTS long distance network provided by GSA.
    (f) An agency may appeal a GSA denial of a request for an exception 
to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).
    (g) If an agency has a requirement for long distance 
telecommunications within the United States, Guam, Puerto Rico, or the 
Virgin Islands that may be outside the scope of FTS, the requirement 
shall be submitted to GSA/T prior to initiating acquisition action. An 
exception to the mandatory use of the FTS long distance network will be 
given if GSA determines the service cannot be provided by the FTS.

     Subpart 101-35.4--Consolidated Local Telecommunications Service


<R05>
Sec. 101-35.400  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart discusses local telecommunications facilities and 
services

[[Page 359]]

provided to executive agencies by GSA and other agencies.


<R05>
Sec. 101-35.401  General.

    Consolidated local telecommunications service is available in most 
buildings occupied by concentrations of Federal employees. Local 
telecommunications includes any access services which provide, for a 
monthly fee, electronic connectivity to a larger telecommunications 
network and those support services which provide for the acquisition, 
operation and management of attached systems. Information on the use of 
consolidated local telecommunications services may be obtained from: 
GSA, Federal Telecommunications Service, Office of Regional Services 
(TR), 1730 M Street, NW., Suite 200, Washington, DC 20036.


<R05>
Sec. 101-35.402  Policies.

    (a) All executive agencies shall evaluate sharing Government owned 
or contracted local telecommunications facilities and services. 
Evaluation criteria and associated decisions must be documented as 
appropriate.
    (b) Executive agencies receiving local telecommunications services 
from another agency, e.g., a GSA consolidated switch, must acknowledge 
their shared responsibility to that community of agencies in exchange 
for those services. Such a community shall be considered a 
telecommunications ``Shared Resource Community.'' The agency primarily 
responsible for providing telecommunications service(s) to members of 
this community shall be the ``Lead Agency.'' Lead agencies must 
acknowledge their responsibility(s) to provide services until an 
alternative arrangement has been coordinated with the community. 
Different agencies may take the lead in providing different services. 
Memoranda of Agreement will identify responsibilities and cost-recovery 
mechanisms.
    (c) GSA charges to agencies for consolidated local 
telecommunications service will cover expenses for installation, changes 
in service, a common distributable charge, and termination.

                      Subpart 101-37.1--Definitions


<R05>
Sec. 101-37.100  Definitions.

    In part 101-37, the following definitions apply:
    Acquisition date means the date the agency acquired the asset.
    Acquisition value means the value initially recorded on agency 
property records and/or accounting records at the time of acquisition. 
If the aircraft is acquired through an interagency transfer, the 
acquisition value is the greater of the aircraft net book value plus the 
cost of returning the aircraft to an airworthy, mission ready condition 
or the commercial retail value of that aircraft in average condition. If 
it is a military aircraft without a commercial equivalent, the 
acquisition value is equal to the scrap value plus the cost of returning 
the aircraft to an airworthy, mission ready condition.
    Actual cost means all costs associated with the use and operation of 
an aircraft as specified in Sec. 101-37.406(b).
    Agency aircraft means an aircraft, excluding aircraft owned by the 
Armed Forces, which is: (1) owned and operated by any executive agency 
or entity thereof, or (2) exclusively leased, chartered, rented, bailed, 
contracted and operated by an executive agency.
    Aircraft accident means an occurrence associated with the operation 
of an aircraft which takes place between the time any person boards the 
aircraft with the intention of flight and all such persons have 
disembarked, and in which any person suffers death or serious injury, or 
in which the aircraft received substantial damage.
    Aircraft part means any part, component, system, or assembly 
primarily designated for aircraft.
    Bailed aircraft means any aircraft borrowed by a department or 
agency from the Department of Defense (DOD), State or local government, 
or other non-Federal entity.

equipment, buildings, facilities, installations, or land, which:
    (1) Is leased to the Federal Government for a term of 5 or more 
years; or
    (2) In the case of a new asset with an economic life of less than 5 
years, is leased to the Federal Government for a

[[Page 363]]

term of 75 percent or more of the economic life of the asset; or
    (3) Is built for the express purpose of being leased to the Federal 
Government; or
    (4) Clearly has no alternative commercial use; e.g., special-purpose 
Government installation.
    Charter aircraft means a one time procurement for aviation resources 
and associated services.
    Civil aircraft means any aircraft other than a public aircraft.
    Contract aircraft means aircraft procured for an agency's exclusive 
use for a specified period of time in accordance with the requirements 
of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 48 CFR Chapter 1 or other 
applicable procurement regulations.
    Criticality Code is the one-digit code assigned by Department of 
Defense to designate an aircraft part as a Flight Safety Critical 
Aircraft Part (FSCAP).
    Deep cover aircraft means an agency aircraft that is utilized to 
gather information for law enforcement purposes. This aircraft does not 
display any agency markings. Although the registration filed with the 
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) may indicate ownership by persons 
other than the owning or using agency, actual ownership will be 
maintained by the owning Federal agency.
    Fatal injury means any injury which results in death within 30 days 
of the accident.
    Fixed costs means the costs of operating aircraft that result from 
owning and supporting the aircraft and do not vary according to aircraft 
usage. For specific fixed aircraft program cost information, see 
Sec. 101-37.201(b).
    Flight Safety Critical Aircraft Part (FSCAP) means any aircraft 
part, assembly, or installation containing a critical characteristic 
whose failure, malfunction, or absence could cause a catastrophic 
failure resulting in loss or serious damage to the aircraft or an 
uncommanded engine shut-down resulting in an unsafe condition.
    Forfeited aircraft means an aircraft acquired by the Government 
either by summary process or by order of a court of competent 
jurisdiction pursuant to any law of the United States.
    Full coach fare means a coach fare available to the general public 
between the day that the travel was planned and the day the travel 
occurred.
    Government aircraft means any aircraft owned, leased, chartered or 
rented and operated by an executive agency.
    Head of executive agency means the head of a Department, agency, 
bureau, or independent establishment in the executive branch, including 
any wholly owned Government corporation, or an official designated in 
writing to act on his or her behalf.
    Incident means an occurrence other than an accident, associated with 
the operation of an aircraft, which affects or could affect the safety 
of operations.

traveler. Bona fide security requirements include, but are not limited 
to, life threatening circumstances. Exceptional scheduling requirements 
include emergencies and other operational considerations which

[[Page 365]]

make commercial transportation unacceptable.
    Residual value means the estimated value of an asset at the 
conclusion of its useful life, net of disposal costs. It is the dollar 
value below which the asset will not be depreciated. Residual value is 
established at the time of acquisition.
    Seized aircraft means an aircraft that has been confiscated by the 
Federal Government either by summary process or by order of a court of 
competent jurisdiction pursuant to any law of the United States and 
whose care and custody will be the responsibility of the Federal 
Government until final ownership is determined by judicial process.
    Senior executive branch official means civilian officials appointed 
by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate and civilian 
employees of the Executive Office of the President (EOP).

third-degree burns, or any burns affecting more than 5 percent of the 
body surface.
    Space available means travel using aircraft capacity, that is 
already scheduled for use for an official purpose, that would otherwise 
be unutilized. For the purposes of this part, space available travel is 
travel other than for the conduct of agency business.
    Substantial damage means damage or failure which adversely affects 
the structural strength, performance, or flight charactersistics of the 
aircraft, and which would normally require major repair or replacement 
of the affected component. Engine failure or damage limited to an engine

             Subpart 101-37.2--Accounting for Aircraft Costs

    Source: 60 FR 3550, Jan. 18, 1995, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 101-37.200  General.

    The provisions of this subpart prescribe policies and procedures for 
accounting for aircraft costs. This subpart also prescribes provisions 
and procedures contained in OMB Circulars A-76 and A-126.


<R05>
Sec. 101-37.201  Standard aircraft program cost elements.

    The following cost elements will be used for the establishment of 
cost accounting systems and for reporting Government-owned and operated 
aircraft cost and utilization data to the Federal Aviation Management 
Information System (FAMIS) on GSA Form 3552.
    (a) Variable costs. The variable costs of operating aircraft are 
those costs that vary depending on how much the aircraft are used. The 
specific variable cost elements include:
    (1) Crew costs. The crew costs which vary according to aircraft 
usage consist of travel expenses, particularly reimbursement of 
subsistence (i.e., per diem and miscellaneous expenses), overtime 
charges, and wages of crew members hired on an hourly or part-time 
basis.
    (2) Maintenance costs. Unscheduled maintenance and maintenance 
scheduled on the basis of flying time vary with aircraft usage and, 
therefore, the associated costs are considered variable costs. In 
addition to the costs of normal maintenance activities, variable 
maintenance costs shall include aircraft refurbishment, such as painting 
and interior restoration, and costs of or allowances for performing 
overhauls and modifications required by service bulletins and 
airworthiness directives. If they wish, agencies may consider all of 
their maintenance costs as variable costs and account for them 
accordingly. Otherwise, certain maintenance costs will be considered 
fixed as described in paragraph (b) of this section. Variable 
maintenance costs include the costs of:
    (i) Maintenance labor. This includes all labor (i.e., salaries and 
wages, benefits, travel, and training) expended by mechanics, 
technicians, and inspectors, exclusive of labor for engine overhaul, 
aircraft refurbishment, and/or repair of major components.
    (ii) Maintenance parts. This includes cost of materials and parts 
consumed in aircraft maintenance and inspections, exclusive of materials 
and parts for engine overhaul, aircraft refurbishment, and/or repair of 
major components.
    (iii) Maintenance contracts. This includes all contracted costs for 
unscheduled maintenance and for maintenance scheduled on a flying hour 
basis or based on the condition of the part or component.
    (iv) Engine overhaul, aircraft refurbishment, and major component 
repairs. These are the materials and labor costs of overhauling engines, 
refurbishing aircraft, and/or repairing major aircraft components.
    (A) In general, the flight hour cost is computed by dividing the 
costs for a period by the projected hours flown during the period. 
However, when computing the flight hour cost factor for this cost 
category, divide the total estimated cost for the activities in this 
category (e.g., overhaul, refurbishment, and major repairs) by the 
number of flight hours between these activities.

[[Page 367]]

    (B) Cost or reserve accounts for engine overhaul, aircraft 
refurbishment, and major component repairs may, at the agency's 
discretion, be identified and quantified separately for mission-
pertinent information purposes. Reserve accounts are generally used when 
the aircraft program is funded through a working capital or revolving 
fund.
    (3) Fuel and other fluids. The costs of the aviation gasoline, jet 
fuel, and other fluids (e.g., engine oil, hydraulic fluids, and water-
methanol) consumed by aircraft.
    (4) Lease costs. When the cost of leasing an aircraft is based on 
flight hours, the associated lease or rental costs are considered 
variable costs.
    (5) Landing and tie down fees. Landing fees and tie down fees 
associated with aircraft usage are considered variable costs. Tie down 
fees for storing an aircraft at its base of operations should be 
considered part of operations overhead, a fixed cost.
    (b) Fixed costs. The fixed costs of operating aircraft are those 
that result from owning and supporting the aircraft and do not vary 
according to aircraft usage. The specific fixed cost elements include:
    (1) Crew costs. The crew costs which do not vary according to 
aircraft usage consist of salaries, benefits, and training costs. This 
includes the salaries, benefits, and training costs of crew members who 
also perform minimal aircraft maintenance. Also included in fixed crew 
costs are the costs of their charts, personal protective equipment, 
uniforms, and other personal equipment when the agency is authorized to 
purchase such items.
    (2) Maintenance costs. This cost category includes maintenance and 
inspection activities which are scheduled on a calendar interval basis 
and take place regardless of whether or how much an aircraft is flown. 
Agencies are encouraged to simplify their accounting systems and account 
for all maintenance costs as variable costs. However, if they wish, 
agencies may account for the following costs as fixed costs:
    (i) Maintenance labor. This includes all projected labor expended by 
mechanics, technicians, and inspectors associated with maintenance 
scheduled on a calendar interval basis. This does not include variable 
maintenance labor or work on items having a retirement life or time 
between overhaul. This category also includes costs associated with 
nonallocated maintenance labor expenses; i.e., associated salaries, 
benefits, travel expenses, and training costs. These costs should be 
evenly allocated over the number of aircraft in the fleet.
    (ii) Maintenance parts. This includes all parts and consumables used 
for maintenance scheduled on a calendar interval basis.
    (iii) Maintenance contracts. This includes all contracted costs for 
maintenance or inspections scheduled on a calendar interval basis.
    (3) Lease costs. When the cost of leasing an aircraft is based on a 
length of time (e.g., days, weeks, months, or years) and does not vary 
according to aircraft usage, the lease costs are considered fixed costs.
    (4) Operations overhead. This includes all costs, not accounted for 
elsewhere, associated with direct management and support of the aircraft 
program. Examples of such costs include: personnel costs (salaries, 
benefits, travel, uniform allowances (when the agency is authorized to 
purchase such items), training, etc.) for management and administrative 
personnel directly responsible for the aircraft program; building and 
ground maintenance; janitorial services; lease or rent costs for hangars 
and administrative buildings and office space; communications and 
utilities costs; office supplies and equipment; maintenance and 
depreciation of support equipment; tie down fees for aircraft located on 
base; and miscellaneous operational support costs.
    (5) Administrative overhead. These costs represent a prorated share 
of salaries, office supplies, and other expenses of fiscal, accounting, 
personnel, management, and similar common services performed outside the 
aircraft program but which support this program. For purposes of 
recovering the costs of operations, agencies should exercise their own 
judgment as to the extent to which aircraft users should bear the 
administrative overhead costs. Agencies may, for example, decide to

[[Page 368]]

charge non-agency users a higher proportion, not to exceed 100 percent 
of administrative overhead, than agency users if the agency has the 
authority to do so. If an aircraft is provided pursuant to an 
interagency agreement under the Economy Act of 1932 (31 U.S.C. 1535), 
the agency must charge based on the actual costs of the goods or 
services provided. For purposes of OMB Circular A-76 costs comparisons, 
agencies should compute the actual administrative costs that would be 
avoided if a decision is made to contract out the operation under study.
    (6) Self-insurance costs. Aviation activity involves risks and 
potential casualty losses and liability claims. These risks are normally 
covered in the private sector by purchasing an insurance policy. The 
Government is self-insuring; the Treasury's General Fund is charged for 
casualty losses and/or liability claims resulting from accidents. For 
the purposes of analyses, Government managers will recognize a cost for 
``self-insurance'' by developing a cost based on rates published by 
GSA's Aircraft Management Division.
    (7) Depreciation. The cost or value of ownership. Aircraft have a 
finite useful economic or service life (useful life). Depreciation is 
the method used to spread the acquisition value, less residual value, 
over an asset's useful life. Although these costs are not direct outlays 
as is the case with most other aircraft costs, it is important to 
recognize them for analyses required by OMB and other cost comparison 
purposes and when replenishing a working capital fund by recovering the 
full cost of aircraft operations. Depreciation costs depend on aircraft 
acquisition or replacement costs, useful life, and residual or salvage 
value. To calculate the cost of depreciation that shall be allocated to 
each year, subtract the residual value from the total of the acquisition 
cost plus any capital improvements and, then, divide by the estimated 
useful life of the asset.
    (c) Other costs. There are certain other costs of the aircraft 
program which should be recorded but are not appropriate for inclusion 
in either the variable or fixed cost categories for the purposes of 
justifying aircraft use or recovering the cost of aircraft operations. 
These costs include:
    (1) Accident repair costs. These costs include all parts, materials, 
equipment, and maintenance labor related to repairing accidental damage 
to airframes or aircraft equipment. Also included are all accident 
investigation costs.
    (2) Aircraft costs. This is the basic aircraft inventory or asset 
account used as the basis for determining aircraft depreciation charges. 
These costs include the cost of acquiring aircraft and accessories, 
including transportation and initial installation. Also included are all 
costs required to bring aircraft and capitalized accessories up to fleet 
standards.
    (3) Cost of capital. The cost of capital is the cost to the 
Government of acquiring the funds necessary for capital investments. The 
agency shall use the borrowing rate announced by the Department of the 
Treasury for bonds or notes whose maturities correspond to the 
manufacturer's suggested useful life or the remaining useful life of the 
asset.


<R05>
Sec. 101-37.202  Policy.

    Agencies shall maintain cost systems for their aircraft operations 
which will permit them to justify the use of Government aircraft in lieu 
of commercially available aircraft, or the use of one Government 
aircraft in lieu of another; recover the costs of operating Government 
aircraft when appropriate; determine the cost effectiveness of various 
aspects of their aircraft program; and conduct the cost comparisons to 
justify in-house operation of Government aircraft versus procurement of 
commercially available aircraft services. To accomplish these purposes, 
agencies must accumulate their aircraft program cost into the standard 
aircraft program cost elements specified in Sec. 1010-37.201.


<R05>
Sec. 101-37.203  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 101-37.204  Operations cost recovery methods.

    Under 31 U.S.C. 1535, and various acts appropriating funds or 
establishing working funds to operate aircraft,

[[Page 369]]

agencies are generally required to recover the costs of operating all 
aircraft in support of other agencies and other governments. Depending 
on the statutory authorities under which its aircraft were obtained or 
are operated, agencies may use either of two methods for establishing 
the rates charged for using their aircraft; full cost recovery rate or 
the variable cost recovery rate.
    (a) The full cost recovery rate for an aircraft is the sum of the 
variable and fixed cost rates for that aircraft. The computation of the 
variable cost rate for an aircraft is described in Sec. 101-37.304. The 
fixed cost recovery rate for an aircraft or aircraft type is computed as 
follows:
    (1) Accumulate the fixed costs listed in Sec. 101-37.201(b) that are 
directly attributable to the aircraft or aircraft type. These costs 
should be taken from the agency's accounting system.
    (2) Adjust the total fixed cost for inflation and for any known 
upcoming cost changes to project the new fixed total costs. The 
inflation factor used should conform to the provisions of OMB Circular 
A-76.
    (3) Allocate operations and administrative overhead costs to the 
aircraft based on the percentage of total aircraft program flying hours 
attributable to that aircraft or aircraft type.
    (4) Compute a fixed cost recovery rate for the aircraft by dividing 
the sum of the projected directly attributable fixed costs, adjusted for 
inflation, from paragraph (a)(2) of this section and the allocated fixed 
costs from paragraph (a)(3) of this section by the annual flying hours 
projected for the aircraft.
    (b) The variable cost recovery rate is the total variable cost rate 
of operating an aircraft described in Sec. 101-37.304. If an agency 
decides to base the charge for using its aircraft solely on this rate, 
it must recover the fixed costs of those aircraft from the 
appropriations which support the mission for which the procurement of 
the aircraft was justified. In such cases, the fixed cost recovery rate 
may be expressed on an annual, monthly, or flying hour basis.
    (c) To compute the full cost recovery rate of using a Government 
aircraft for a trip, add the variable cost recovery rate for the 
aircraft or aircraft type to the corresponding fixed cost recovery rate 
and multiply this sum by the estimated number of flying hours for the 
trip using the proposed aircraft.


<R05>
Sec. 101-37.205  Aircraft program cost effectiveness.

    Although cost data are not the only measures of the effectiveness of 
an agency's aircraft program, they can be useful in identifying 
opportunities to reduce aircraft operational costs. These opportunities 
include changing maintenance practices, purchasing fuel at lower costs, 
and the replacement of old, inefficient aircraft with aircraft that are 
more fuel efficient and have lower operation and maintenance costs. The 
most common measures used to evaluate the cost effectiveness of various 
aspects of an aircraft program are expressed as the cost per flying hour 
or per passenger mile (one passenger flying one mile). These measures 
may be developed using the standard aircraft program cost elements (see 
Sec. 101-37.201) and include, but are not limited to: maintenance costs/
flying hours, fuel and other fluids/flying hours, and variable cost/
passenger mile. GSA will coordinate the development of other specific 
cost-effectiveness measures with the appropriate Interagency Committee 
for Aviation Policy subcommittees (ICAP).
    (a) Maintenance costs per flying hour. Maintenance costs per flying 
hour identifies on an aggregate basis relative cost effectiveness of 
maintenance alternatives. This measure is among those necessary to 
identify and justify procurement of less costly aircraft.
    (b) Fuel and other fluids cost per flying hour. Fuel per flying hour 
identifies the relative fuel efficiency of an individual aircraft. The 
measure identifies the requirement to replace inefficient engines or to 
eliminate fuel inefficient aircraft from the fleet.
    (c) Crew costs-fixed per flying hour. When based on the total fixed 
crew costs and flying hours, can be used to determine the impact of crew 
utilization on overall operating costs; can also be used to compare crew 
utilization and salary levels among different agency or bureau aircraft 
programs.

[[Page 370]]

    (d) Operations overhead per flying hour. Operations overhead may be 
used on an aggregate basis (i.e., total operations overhead expenditures 
divided by hours flown) to compare the overhead activities in direct 
support of aircraft operations among agencies or bureaus. This factor 
can indicate excess overhead support costs.
    (e) Administrative overhead per flying hour. Administrative overhead 
may be used on an aggregate basis (i.e., total administrative overhead 
divided by hours flown) to compare the level of administrative support 
to other agencies and bureaus.

<R05>
Sec. 101-37.304  Variable cost rate.

    For the purpose of comparing costs (Government, commercial charter, 
and airline) associated with passenger transportation flights, as 
required by Sec. 101-37.406, the agency should develop a variable cost 
rate for each aircraft or aircraft type as follows:
    (a) Accumulate or allocate to the aircraft or aircraft type all 
historical costs, for the previous 12 months, grouped under the variable 
cost category defined in Sec. 101-37.201. These costs should be obtained 
from the agency's accounting system.
    (b) Adjust the historical variable costs for inflation and for any 
known upcoming cost changes to determine the projected variable cost. 
The inflation factor used should conform to the provisions of OMB 
Circular A-76.
    (c) Divide the projected variable cost of the aircraft or aircraft 
type by the projected annual flying hours for the aircraft or aircraft 
type to compute the variable cost rate (per flying hour).
    (d) To compute the variable cost for a proposed trip, multiply the 
variable cost rate by the estimated number of flying hours for the trip. 
The number of flying hours should include:
    (1) If no follow-up trip is scheduled, all time required to position 
the aircraft to begin the trip and to return the aircraft to its normal 
base of operations.
    (2) If a follow-on trip requires repositioning, the cost for 
respositioning should be charged to the associated follow-on trip.
    (3) If an aircraft supports a multi-leg trip (a series of flights 
scheduled sequentially), the use of the aircraft for the total trip may 
be justified by comparing the total variable cost of the entire trip to 
the commercial aircraft cost (including charter) for all legs of the 
trip.


<R05>
Sec. 101-37.305  Acquisition and management.

    (a) The number and size of aircraft acquired by an agency and the 
capacity of those aircraft to carry passengers and cargo shall not 
exceed the level necessary to meet the agency's mission requirements.
    (b) Agencies must comply with OMB Circular A-76 before purchasing, 
leasing, or otherwise acquiring aircraft and related services to assure 
that these services cannot be obtained from and operated by the private 
sector more cost effectively.
    (c) Agencies shall review on a 5-year cycle the continuing need for 
all of their aircraft and the cost effectiveness of their aircraft 
operations in accordance with OMB approved cost justification 
methodologies. A copy of each agency review shall be submitted to GSA 
when completed and to OMB with the agency's next budget submission.

[[Page 371]]

Agencies shall report any excess aircraft and release all aircraft that 
are not fully justified by these reviews.
    (d) Agencies shall use their aircraft in the most cost effective way 
to meet their requirements.

Sec. 101-37.400  General.

    The provisions of this subpart prescribe policies and procedures for 
the use of Government aircraft. This subpart incorporates certain 
provisions of OMB Circular A-126 and OMB Bulletin Number 93-11.


<R05>
Sec. 101-37.401  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 101-37.402  Policy.

    Government aircraft shall be used for official purposes only in 
accordance with applicable laws and regulations, including this subpart.
    (a) Use of Government aircraft. Agencies shall operate Government 
aircraft only for official purposes. Official purposes include the 
operation of Government aircraft for:
    (1) Mission requirements, and
    (2) Other official travel.
    (b) Use of Government aircraft for official travel or on space 
available travel is subject to paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this 
section.
    (1) Use of a Government aircraft for official travel other than 
required use travel or mission requirement travel; i.e., for the conduct 
of agency business, shall be authorized only when:
    (i) No commercial airline or aircraft service (including charter) is 
reasonably available to fulfill effectively the agency's requirement; or
    (ii) The actual cost of using a Government aircraft is not more than 
the cost of commercial airline or aircraft service (including charter). 
When a flight is made for mission requirements or required use travel 
(and is certified as such in writing by the agency which is conducting 
the mission), it is presumed that secondary use of the aircraft for 
other travel for the conduct of agency business will result in cost 
savings.
    (2) Use of a Government aircraft on a space available basis is 
authorized only when:
    (i) The aircraft is already scheduled for use for an official 
purpose;
    (ii) Space available travel does not require a larger aircraft than 
needed for the already scheduled official purpose;
    (iii) Space available use results in no, or only minor, additional 
cost to the Government; and
    (iv) Reimbursement is provided as set forth in Sec. 101-37.403 of 
this subpart.
    (c) The Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, Attorney General, 
Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Director of 
Central Intelligence may use Government aircraft for travel other than:
    (1) To meet mission requirements, or
    (2) For the conduct of agency business, but only upon reimbursement 
at full coach fare and with authorization by the President or his 
designated representative on the grounds that a threat exists which 
could endanger lives or when continuous 24-hour secure communication is 
required.


<R05>
Sec. 101-37.403  Reimbursement for the use of Government aircraft.

    A passenger transported by Government aircraft is required to 
reimburse the Government under the circumstances specified, and in the 
amount indicated, in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section.
    (a) For travel that is not required use travel:
    (1) Any incidental private activities (personal or political) of an 
employee undertaken on an employee's own time while on official travel 
shall not result in any increase in the actual costs to the Government 
of operating the aircraft, and
    (2) The Government shall be reimbursed the appropriate share of the 
full coach fare for any portion of the time on the trip spent on 
political activities (except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d) of 
this section).
    (b) For required use travel (except as otherwise provided in 
paragraph (d) of this section).

[[Page 372]]

    (1) For a wholly personal or political trip, the Government shall be 
reimbursed the full coach fare for the trip,
    (2) For an official trip during which the employee engages in 
political activities, the Government shall be reimbursed the appropriate 
share of the full coach fare for the entire trip, and
    (3) For an official trip during which the employee flies to one or 
more locations for personal reasons, the Government shall be reimbursed 
the excess of the full coach fare of all flights taken by the employee 
on the trip over the full coach fare of the flights that would have been 
taken by the employee had there been no personal activities on the trip.
    (c) For space available travel, whether on mission requirements or 
other flights, the Government shall be reimbursed at the full coach fare 
except:
    (1) As authorized under 10 U.S.C. 4744 and regulations implementing

<R05>
Sec. 101-37.405  Approving travel on Government aircraft.

    Policy and practices under which travel on Government aircraft may 
be approved by the agency are specified in paragraphs (a) through (c) of 
this section.
    (a) All travel on Government aircraft must have advance 
authorization by the sponsoring agency in accordance with its travel 
policies, OMB Circular A-126 and, when applicable, documented on an 
official travel authorization. Where possible, such travel authorization 
must be approved by at least one organizational level above that of the 
person(s) traveling. If review by a higher organizational level is not 
possible, another appropriate approval is required.
    (b) All required use travel must have written approval on a trip-by-
trip basis from the agency's senior legal official or the principal 
deputy, unless:
    (1) The President has determined that all travel or travel in 
specified categories by an agency head is qualified as required use 
travel, or
    (2) The agency head has determined that all travel or travel in 
specified categories by an officer or employee other than the agency 
head, is qualified as required use travel.
    (i) Any determination by an agency head that travel by an officer or 
employee of that agency qualifies as required use travel must be in 
writing and set forth the basis for that determination. In emergency 
situations an after-the-fact written certification by an agency is 
permitted.
    (ii) An agency head opting to determine that travel by an officer or 
employee may be required use travel shall establish written standards 
for determining when required use travel is permitted. Such travel shall 
not be permitted unless the travel is in conformance with the written 
standards.
    (c) All travel by senior Federal officials, family members of senior 
Federal officials, and non-Federal travelers that is not to meet mission 
requirements or required use travel must be authorized in advance and in 
writing.

[[Page 373]]

    (1) Such authorization must be approved on a trip-by-trip basis and 
must be signed by the agency's senior legal official or the principal 
deputy, or be in conformance with an agency review and approval system 
that has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). In 
emergency situations, an after-the-fact written certification by an 
agency is permitted.
    (2) In addition to the provisions of this subpart, Federal employees 
on official travel shall be subject to all other applicable travel rules 
and regulations. Travel by such individuals that is not official travel, 
for purposes of this subpart, is subject to the reimbursement 
requirements in Sec. 101-37.403(c) of this subpart for space available 
travel.


<R05>
Sec. 101-37.406  Justification of the use of Government aircraft for transportation of passengers.

    (a) The cost comparison justifying the use of a Government aircraft 
for a proposed trip as required by Sec. 101-37.402(b)(1)(ii) of this 
subpart should be made prior to authorizing the use of the aircraft for 
that trip. Standard trip cost justification schedules developed by 
agencies may be used for this purpose. Agencies that are not able to use 
such schedules are required to conduct a cost justification on a case-
by-case basis.
    (b) When conducting a cost comparison, the agency must compare the 
actual cost of using a Government aircraft to the cost of using a 
commercial aircraft (including charter) or airline service. The actual 
cost of using a Government aircraft is either:
    (1) The amount that the agency will be charged by the organization 
that provides the aircraft,
    (2) The variable cost of using the aircraft, if the agency operates 
its own aircraft, or
    (3) The variable cost of using the aircraft as reported by the 
owning agency, if the agency is not charged for the use of an aircraft 
owned by another agency.
    (c) The cost of using commercial airline or aircraft services for 
the purpose of justifying the use of Government aircraft:
    (1) Must be the current Government contract fare or price, or the 
lowest fare or price available for the trip(s) in question,
    (2) Must include, as appropriate, any differences in the cost of 
ground travel, per diem and miscellaneous travel (e.g., taxis, parking, 
etc.), and lost employees' work time (computed at gross hourly costs to 
the Government, including benefits), between using Government aircraft 
and commercial aircraft services, and
    (3) Must include only the costs associated with passengers on 
official business. Costs associated with passengers traveling on a space 
available basis may not be used in the cost comparison.


<R05>
Sec. 101-37.407  Documentation.

    All uses of Government aircraft must be documented, and this 
documentation must be retained for at least 2 years by the aircraft 
operations manager. The documentation of each use of Government aircraft 
must include the information specified in paragraphs (a) through (g) of 
this section:
    (a) Aircraft registration number (the registration number assigned 
by the Federal Aviation Administration or military-designated tail 
number);
    (b) Purpose of the flight (the mission the aircraft was dispatched 
to perform);
    (c) Route(s) flown;
    (d) Flight date(s) and times;
    (e) Name of each traveler;
    (f) Name(s) of the pilot(s) and aircrew;
    (g) When Government aircraft are used to support official travel, 
the documentation must also include evidence that Sec. 101-37.408 and 
other applicable provisions of this FPMR have been satisfied.


<R05>

<R05>
Sec. 101-37.1106  Accident and incident investigation procedures.

    The policies on agency aircraft accident/incident investigations are 
as follows:
    (a) For the purposes of this regulation, accident and incident 
investigations are factfinding proceedings for accident prevention with 
no formal issues and no adverse parties and not adjudications of the 
rights or liabilities of any person. Therefore, these investigations are 
not intended to be subject to the provisions of the Administrative 
Procedures Act (Pub. L. 89-554, 80 Stat. 384 (5 U.S.C. 554 et seq.)).
    (b) The operating agency is responsible for the conduct of an 
investigation of all accidents/incidents involving agency aircraft. 
Agencies may utilize in-house resources or enter into agreements with 
the NTSB, another agency, or a commercial contractor for the conduct of 
accident/incident investigations. The investigator-in-charge shall meet 
the standards prescribed in Sec. 101-37.1107. These investigations shall 
be conducted primarily to determine the probable causes for accidents/
incidents, and secondarily to obtain and preserve available factual 
evidence.
    (c) Responsibility of the operating agency. (1) The operating agency 
is responsible for the organization, conduct, and control of all agency 
aircraft accident/incident investigations involving the agency's 
aircraft.
    (2) The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) may conduct aviation 
investigations in accordance with appendix A of the Reimbursable 
Memorandum of Agreement between the Department of Transportation and the 
NTSB.

[[Page 381]]

Copies of the memorandum of agreement may be obtained from the National 
Transportation Safety Board, 490 L'Enfant Plaza East, SW, Washington, DC 
20594. Investigation of an accident or incident involving agency 
aircraft of U.S. registry in a foreign state is at the discretion of the 
NTSB and applicable conventions.
    (3) The operating agency shall pay expenses pertaining to the 
accident or incident investigation except as provided by separate 
agreement such as travel, investigator overtime, laboratory expense, 
etc.
    (d) Nature of investigation. Accident or incident investigations are 
conducted by operating agencies in order to determine the facts, 
conditions, and circumstances relating to each accident or incident, the 
probable cause(s) thereof, and measures which will best prevent similar 
accidents or incidents in the future. The investigation includes the 
field investigation and report preparation.
    (e) Priority of NTSB conducted investigations. When the NTSB is 
conducting the investigation pursuant to an agreement with an executive 
agency, the NTSB will provide for the appropriate participation by the 
operating agencies in any such investigation and said agencies will be 
offered the opportunity to submit proposed findings for the NTSB's 
consideration in determining the probable cause(s) of the accident. To 
the extent agencies conduct a separate investigation of an accident or 
incident involving agency aircraft, the investigation must not interfere 
with the investigation by the NTSB and must comply with the requirements 
of this part.
    (f) The NTSB and other executive agencies will ensure that 
appropriate factual information obtained or developed in the course of 
their investigations is exchanged in a timely manner. Information 
developed through analysis and lab work shall be coordinated with 
operating agencies for the conduct of the evaluative report required by 
this subpart.
    (g) Request to withhold information. Any person may make written 
objection to the public disclosure of information contained in any 
report or document filed, or of information obtained by the NTSB or 
investigating agency, stating the grounds for such objection. The 
investigating agency may withhold from public disclosure information 
that can be withheld under the provisions of the Freedom of Information 
Act (5 U.S.C. 552). Information may be withheld if privileged or 
classified, for example, for national security reasons. The 
inaccessibility to such material or classified information is not 
sufficient reason to prevent the normal course of the investigation.
    (h) Authority of the investigating agency. Any employee of the 
investigating agency, upon presenting appropriate credentials after 
obtaining the owner's consent may enter any property wherein an agency 
aircraft accident has occurred or wreckage from any such accident is 
located to conduct an investigation. The investigating agency should 
examine any pertinent records, including documents, papers, medical 
files, hospital records, and correspondence, relevant to the accident/
incident. Authorized representatives of the investigating agency may 
question any person having knowledge relevant to an aircraft accident/
incident. The investigating agency should examine and test to the extent 
necessary any non-military agency aircraft parts, aircraft engine, 
propeller, appliance, or Government property aboard an aircraft involved 
in an accident involving an agency aircraft.
    (i) Participants to the field investigation. (1) The investigator-
in-charge may designate participants in the field investigation. 
Participants should be limited to those persons, Government agencies, 
companies, and associations whose employees, functions, activities, or 
products were involved in the accident or incident and who can provide 
suitable qualified technical personnel to actively assist in the field 
investigation. In a NTSB investigation, a representative of the 
operating agency shall be invited to participate in the NTSB 
investigation, subject to the supervision of the NTSB's investigator.
    (2) No participant in the field investigation designated under 
paragraph (a) of this section should be represented by any person who 
also represents claimants or insurers. Failure

[[Page 382]]

to comply with this provision shall result in loss of status as a 
participant in the investigation.
    (j) Access to and release of wreckage, records, mail, and cargo. (1) 
Only the investigating agency's accident investigation personnel and 
persons authorized by the investigator-in-charge to participate in any 
particular investigation, examination, or testing shall be permitted 
access to wreckage, records, mail, or cargo which is in the agency's 
custody.
    (2) Wreckage, records, mail, and cargo in the custody of the 
investigator-in-charge shall be released by an authorized representative 
of the investigating agency when it is determined that the investigating 
agency has no further need of such wreckage, records, mail, or cargo.
    (k) Release and dissemination of accident information. (1) Release 
of factual information during the field investigation, particularly at 
the accident scene, shall be in accordance with the investigating 
agency's procedures.
    (2) All information concerning the accident or incident obtained by 
any personnel participating in the field investigation shall be passed 
to the investigator-in-charge, through appropriate channels. Upon 
approval of the investigator-in-charge, parties to the investigation may 
relay to their respective organization information which is necessary 
for prevention or remedial action. Under no circumstances shall accident 
information be released to or discussed with unauthorized persons whose 
knowledge thereof might adversely affect the investigation.
    (l) Proposed findings. Any person, Government agency, company, or 
association whose employees, functions, activities, or products were 
involved in an accident under investigation may submit to the 
investigating agency, prior to the consideration of probable cause, 
proposed findings to be drawn from the evidence produced during the 
course of the accident investigation, a proposed probable cause, and 
proposed safety recommendations designed to prevent future accidents.

Sec. 101-37.1107  Aircraft accident and incident investigator classifications and qualification standards and qualification levels.

    The following classifications and qualification standards, together 
with the aircraft accident factors, are recommended for those 
individuals designated or assigned to investigate aircraft accidents/
incidents. These individuals do not have to be full-time accident/
incident investigators. These standards should be used as a guide to 
ensure that qualified personnel conduct accident investigations; 
however, they do not supersede those job classification series 
prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management.
    (a) Each person selected to investigate aircraft accidents and 
incidents should have a level of aviation related knowledge and 
experience appropriate to meet the qualifications prescribed in 
paragraphs (a) (1) through (3) of this section. An investigator 
beginning at the trainee level must take a recognized course in basic 
aircraft accident investigation which, as a minimum, consists of 80 
hours of instruction in aircraft accident investigation theory and

<R05>
Sec. 101-37.1108  Accident and incident investigation reports.

    The policies governing aircraft accident/incident investigation 
reports are as follows:
    (a) The operating agency or its designated investigating entity; 
e.g., NTSB, commercial contractors, etc., should prepare reports for all 
accidents/incidents involving agency aircraft that such agency or entity 
investigates.
    (b) The factual report and the evaluative report are the 
responsibility of the operating agency. Agencies may establish 
agreements for the preparation of the factual and evaluative reports 
with the qualified in-house resources, commercial contractors, and/or 
another agency pursuant to an interagency agreement.
    (1) Factual report. The purpose of this report is to assemble all 
available facts about an accident/incident so that conclusions as to 
probable cause(s) can be made, and secondarily for use in other 
proceedings outside the area of accident/incident prevention. This 
report does not contain opinions, conclusions, or recommendations of the 
investigator(s) concerning any aspect of the accident/incident and 
should be made available to any government agency and/or private 
individuals or groups. When agencies conduct investigations, a copy of 
the narrative summary will be provided to the NTSB. This report includes 
only a factual narrative summary prepared by the investigator(s), all 
factual material collected by the investigator(s), and a list of all 
known witnesses. Privileged material such as proprietary material of 
manufacturers shall be attached in sealed addenda and released only as 
appropriate. The factual summary prepared by the investigator(s) should 
give an overview of the pertinent facts contained in the factual report. 
Normally, the summary should include, but is not limited to:
    (i) Accident/incident identification, including aircraft number and 
type, date, and time of accident/incident;
    (ii) History of flight/operation, including the flight's origin, 
course, destination, time of departure, and time of termination;
    (iii) Purpose of flight;
    (iv) Briefing and pre-flight, including crew rest, description of 
any briefing and pre-flight procedures;
    (v) Flight, including flight plan, communications, navigation, 
aircraft parameters (altitude, speed, etc.), and weather;

[[Page 384]]

    (vi) Impact, including description of time, date, aircraft altitude, 
airspeed, angle of attack, and related facts at time of impact;
    (vii) Personal and survival equipment, and survivability;
    (viii) Rescue/crash response;
    (ix) Maintenance;
    (x) Airframe;
    (xi) Crew qualifications;
    (xii) Medical, including use and function of restraint systems;
    (xiii) NAVAIDS and facilities; and
    (xiv) Results of on-sight and off-sight testing.
    (2) Evaluative report. The purpose of this report is to improve 
safety by preventing accidents/incidents. This report is used to assist 
agencies to build or enhance an effective aviation safety program. This 
report contains the conclusions, opinions, and recommendations of the 
investigator(s) and certain designated witness' statements. Except for 
the aforementioned witness statements, no factual information and/or 
material not available in the factual report should be referred to or 
relied upon in this report. Evaluative notes of the agency's 
investigator(s), to the extent they may be retained, should be attached 
to this report.
    (i) The utility of the evaluative report depends in part on candid 
statements and observations by witnesses or those directly involved in 
the accident/incident. (See paragraph (d) of this section.) Therefore, 
the investigator-in-charge should inform witnesses that their statements 
are intended to be used only for safety evaluation and improvement 
purposes.
    (ii) If the investigator-in-charge, in consultation with agency 
counsel, has determined that a witness' statement may be privileged, it 
should be attached only to the evaluative report.
    (c) Limited use and protection of the evaluative report. The 
evaluative report, attachments, and report endorsements are exempt from 
disclosure to the extent covered by 5 U.S.C. 552 (b)(5). Agency counsel 
can determine the extent of such coverage. The evaluative report should 
be used only for safety purposes.
    (d) Preventing use of information contained in the evaluative report 
for other than its intended purposes encourages aircraft accident/
incident witnesses, investigator(s), and endorsers of aircraft 
evaluative reports and attachments to provide complete, open, and 
forthright information, opinions, conclusions, and recommendations 
regarding the accident/incident investigated. If aircraft accident/
incident investigator(s) and endorsers believed that their 
deliberations, opinions, and recommendations could be used for other 
than safety purposes, they might be reluctant to develop or include in 
their reports and endorsements information which would be vital for 
safety and for the prevention of future loss of life, bodily injury, 
and/or property damage.
    (e) Investigators. Consistent with the policies and procedures 
contained in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section, all 
investigators, including but not limited to investigators-in-charge, may 
testify as to the factual information they obtained during the course of 
the accident investigation, including factual evaluations embodied in 
the factual report.

Sec. 101-38.104  Fuel efficient passenger automobiles and light trucks.

    (a) This section provides policy governing the acquisition of fuel-
efficient passenger automobiles and light trucks by executive agencies 
and provides for the administration of a consolidated Federal fleet plan 
for use in monitoring those acquisitions. This authority is derived from 
Executive Order 11912, dated April 13, 1976, 3 CFR, 1976 Comp., p. 114), 
and Executive Order 12375, dated August 4, 1982, 3 CFR, 1982 Comp., p. 
202), which designated and empower the Administrator of General Services 
to perform, without approval, ratification, or other action by the 
President the functions vested in the President by section 510 of the 
Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act, as amended (89 Stat. 
915, 15 U.S.C. 2010).
    (b) The acquisition of passenger automobiles by an executive agency 
shall be limited to class IA, IB, or II (small, subcompact, or compact) 
unless the agency certifies to the Administrator of General Services 
that a larger class vehicle is essential to the agency's mission. The 
certification shall include the reasons for requiring a vehicle larger 
than a class II, compact.
    (1) In compliance with Executive Orders 11912 and 12375, GSA 
administers a consolidated Federal fleet program to monitor passenger 
automobiles and light trucks acquired by executive agencies. The program 
is based upon the actual vehicle leases and purchases of passenger 
automobiles and light trucks, reported by vehicle class, by executive 
agencies to GSA. GSA administers the program by maintaining a master 
record of the miles per gallon ratings for passenger automobiles and 
light trucks actually acquired by each agency during the fiscal year. 
The GSA program will be used to verify that each agency's vehicle leases 
and purchases conform with Executive Order 12375; i.e., the agency will 
achieve the fleet average fuel economy for the applicable fiscal year.
    (2) The Federal fleet program enables GSA to determine the total 
fleet average fuel economy achieved by all executive agencies at the end 
of each fiscal year and to provide management assistance to agencies to 
ensure compliance with Executive Order 12375. Copies or synopses of 
actual vehicle leases and vehicle purchases not procured through the GSA 
Automotive Center shall be forwarded to the General Services 
Administration, ATTN: MTV, Washington, DC 20405, not later than December 
1st of each year, in accordance with the requirements set forth in 
Sec. 101-38.105.
    (3) Passenger automobiles and light trucks acquired by executive 
agencies must meet the fleet average fuel economy objectives set forth 
below for the appropriate fiscal year:

\1\ Established by section 502 of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act (89 Stat. 902, 15 U.S.C.
  2002) and the Secretary of Transportation.
\2\ Established by the Secretary of Transportation and mandated by Executive Order 12003 through fiscal year
  1981 and by Executive Order 12375 beginning in fiscal year 1982.
\3\ Fleet average fuel economy for light trucks is the combined fleet average fuel economy for all 4x2 and 4x4
  light trucks.
\4\ Requirements not yet established by the Secretary of Transportation.
 

    (4)(i) The method of calculating the fleet average fuel economy uses 
harmonic averaging and is specifically required by section 510 of the 
Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act (89 Stat. 915; 15 U.S.C. 
2010) and applies to the calculations for passenger automobiles and 
light trucks. A sample of the method used to calculate the fleet average 
fuel economy is shown in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section. This 
information is derived from the total number of vehicles to be acquired 
by an agency and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) miles per 
gallon rating provided by GSA in accordance with Sec. 101-105(a).
    (ii) Light trucks: 4 x 2, total number (600) divided by:
    (A) Six-cylinder automatic transmission passenger vans and cargo 
vans (200) divided by 22.1 mpg, plus
    (B) Eight-cylinder automatic transmission passenger vans and cargo 
vans (75) divided by 19.2 mpg, plus
    (C) Six-cylinder manual transmission pick-ups (100) divided by 20.8 
mpg, plus
    (D) Sic-cylinder automatic transmission pick-ups (200) divided by 
20.5 mpg, plus
    (E) Six-cylinder automatic transmission compact van wagons (25) 
divided by 23.4 mpg.

    (5) An agency may request exemptions from paragraph (b)(4) of this 
section for light trucks or categories of light trucks if they are 
determined to be appropriate in terms of energy conservation, economy, 
efficiency, or service. Agencies shall submit these requests in writing 
to the Administrator of General Services, Washington, DC 20405, and 
shall state the reasons supporting the request for exemption. The 
Administrator will review the request, determine if the request is 
appropriate, and advise the requesting agency of the determination. 
Light trucks exempted under the provisions of this paragraph shall not 
be included in the calculation of an agency's fleet average fuel 
economy.
    (6) This subpart does not apply to passenger automobiles and light 
trucks designed to perform combat-related missions for the U.S. Armed 
Forces or designed for use in law enforcement or emergency rescue work.

Sec. 101-38.105  Agency purchase and lease of motor vehicles.

    (a) Executive agencies that obtain a waiver of the provisions of 
Sec. 101-26.501-1 in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of that 
section may acquire vehicles without using the services of the GSA 
Automotive Center. Copies or synopses of actual vehicle leases and 
purchases acquired for domestic fleets which are not acquired through 
the GSA Automotive Center will be furnished to the General Services 
Administration, ATTN: MTV, Washington, DC 20405. Each submission shall 
use the unadjusted combined city/highway mileage ratings for passenger 
automobiles and light trucks developed by the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) for each fiscal year. The submissions shall be forwarded to 
GSA as soon as possible after the purchase or effective date of the 
lease. All submissions for the previous fiscal year shall reach GSA by 
December 1st of each year. GSA issues information concerning the EPA 
mileage ratings and miles per gallon rating guidance to assist agencies 
in the timely planning of their acquisitions. Agencies not intending to 
purchase or lease vehicles or agencies that satisfy their total motor 
vehicle requirements through the GSA Interagency Fleet Management System 
shall so inform GSA.
    (b) The submission of actual vehicle leases and agency purchases or 
synopses for passenger automobiles and light trucks acquired during the 
fiscal year includes vehicles which were procured or leased for use in 
any State or Commonwealth of the United States and the District of 
Columbia. Agencies shall not include passenger automobiles and light 
trucks which are:
    (1) Procured or leased for use outside the foregoing areas;
    (2) Designed to perform combat-related missions for the U.S. Armed 
Forces; or
    (3) Designed for use in law enforcement or emergency rescue work.

[[Page 394]]

    (c) Requisitions for passenger automobiles and light trucks sent to 
GSA for procurement action, but for which a contract is not awarded 
during the same fiscal year the requisitions are submitted, shall be 
included in the agency's vehicle lease and purchase record for the 
fiscal year in which the contract is awarded.
    (d) When a vehicle lease contains an option to renew and the option 
is exercised, that renewal action shall not be included as a new 
acquisition. However, before the exercise of the renewal option, an 
agency must submit its requirements to GSA in accordance with Sec. 101-
39.204 of this chapter to determine if the requirement can be satisfied 
through the Interagency Fleet Management System.
    (e) In order to maintain a master record of all leased passenger 
vehicles and light trucks under 8,500 pounds (GVWR), agencies shall 
forward to the General Services Administration, ATTN: MTV, Washington, 
DC 20405, copies or synopses of lease agreements for those vehicles 
leased for a period of 60 continuous days or more, or they may submit 
the following information:
    (1) Number of vehicles, by category;
    (2) Year;
    (3) Make;
    (4) Model;
    (5) Transmission type (if manual, number of forward speeds);
    (6) Cubic inch displacement;
    (7) Fuel type (i.e., gasoline or alternative fuel);
    (8) Monthly lease cost;
    (9) Duration of lease (include option to renew);
    (10) Vehicle type (4 x 2 or 4 x 4--light trucks only);
    (11) Gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR): Light trucks only; and
    (12) Lessor's name and address.
    (f) Submission of requisitions for procurement or requests for 
authority to lease vehicles, which in the judgment of GSA will result in 
noncompliance with the fleet average fuel economy by the end of the 
fiscal year, may result in requisitions being held in abeyance pending 
adjustment to the agency's acquisition plan to ensure compliance with 
fuel economy requirements.
    (g) Requisitions submitted to GSA for vehicles shall conform to the 
requirements of Sec. 101-25.501 of this chapter.
    (h) Agencies may request GSA assistance when planning their 
acquisitions by contacting the General Services Administration, Attn: 
MTV, Washington, DC 20405.
    (i) Information concerning vehicles purchased for agencies by the 
GSA Automotive Center is provided internally; therefore, vehicles 
procured by GSA are not required to be reported.

     Subpart 101-38.2--Registration, Identification, and Exemptions


<R05>
Sec. 101-38.200  General requirements.

    (a) Official U.S. Government tags shall be used on all Government-
owned or-leased motor vehicles, unless specifically exempted by this 
subpart.
    (b) Each motor vehicle acquired for official purposes (except 
vehicles exempted by this subpart) shall display the legends ``For 
Official Use Only'' (in letters not less than \1/2\ inch and not over 
\3/4\ inch high) and ``U.S. Government'' (in letters not less than \3/4\ 
inch and not over 1 inch high) and agency identification as provided in 
this subpart. Motor vehicles of the Department of Defense shall be 
governed by Sec. 101-38.203-2.
    (c) Where motor vehicles display agency identification in accordance 
with this subpart, such identification shall be replaced when necessary 
due to damage or wear, and should be accomplished without excessive 
expense.
    (d) Motor vehicles rented from private or commercial sources for a 
period of less than 6 months and used primarily for off-highway work 
need not display the legends ``For Official Use Only'' and ``U.S. 
Government'' and agency identification; however, such vehicles leased 
for periods of 6 months or longer shall display official U.S. Government 
tags and agency identification as prescribed in the subpart. Sedans and 
station wagons acquired for periods of 60 continuous days or more must 
be identified in accordance with Sec. 101-38.203-1(a).
    (e) Motor vehicles (other than military design motor vehicles) 
acquired

[[Page 395]]

for official purposes, exempted by the provisions of this subpart from 
the display of official U.S. Government tags and other identification, 
shall carry the regular license plates issued by the State, 
Commonwealth, territory, or possession in which each motor vehicle is 
principally operated, or issued by the District of Columbia if the motor 
vehicle is regularly based in the District of Columbia. In addition, 
these vehicles are exempted from other requirements (forms, etc.) as 
specified in this subpart.
    (f) Exemptions, in addition to those authorized in Secs. 101-38.204-
1 and 101-38.204-2 may be authorized by the head of the agency or 
designee upon written certification that conspicuous identification will 
interfere with the purpose for which the motor vehicle is used. This 
certification shall be maintained at the agency headquarters. A copy of 
this certification shall also be provided to the General Services 
Administration, Attn: FBF, Washington, DC 20406, if the vehicle is 
obtained through the GSA Interagency Fleet Management System. Approval 
by GSA will not be required. The certification must state that the motor 
vehicle(s) is (are) acquired and used primarily for the purpose of 
investigative, law enforcement, or intelligence duties involving 
security activities or for safety of the vehicle's occupant(s), and that 
the identification of the motor vehicle(s) would interfere with the 
discharge of such duties or endanger the security of individuals or the 
United States Government. Vehicles regularly used for common 
administrative purposes not directly connected with the performance of 
law enforcement, investigative, or intelligence duties involving 
security activities shall not be exempt. All exemptions granted under 
the provisions of this Sec. 101-38.200(f) are limited to 1 year. If the 
requirement for exemption still exists at the end of the year, the 
agency shall recertify its intent to continue the exemption. A copy of 
this certification shall be forwarded to GSA if the vehicle is leased 
from the GSA Interagency Fleet Management System.
    (g) Certain organizational units of Federal agencies may be 
authorized to remove official Government markings and substitute license 
plates issued by the appropriate State, Commonwealth, territory, or 
possession whenever the agency head or designee determines that 
temporary removal is in the public interest. A written determination and 
justification for temporary removal of official Government markings 
shall be maintained at the agency headquarters. This determination shall 
also be submitted to the General Services Administration, Attn: FBF, 
Washington, DC 20406, if the vehicle is leased from the GSA Interagency 
Fleet Management System.

<R05>
Sec. 101-39.100  General.

    GSA will conduct studies of the operation and costs of motor vehicle 
and motor vehicle services in selected geographical areas to determine 
the advisability of establishing fleet management systems.
    (a) Based on these studies, the Administrator of General Services, 
with the assistance of the affected agencies, shall develop necessary 
data and cost statistics for use in determining the feasibility of 
establishing a fleet management system in the geographical area studied.
    (b) If the Administrator, GSA, determines that a fleet management 
system shall be established, a formal determination is prepared to that 
effect.
    (c) In the event the Administrator, GSA, decides that the 
establishment of a fleet management system is not feasible, the head of 
each agency concerned will be notified.
    (d) In the making of determinations for the establishment of fleet 
management systems, the Administrator, GSA, will, to the extent 
consistent with the provisions of section 1(b) of Executive Order 10579, 
observe the policies outlined in the Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB) Circular A-76, for the utilization of commercial facilities.
    (e) Except as provided in this subpart, all Government motor 
vehicles subsequently acquired for official purposes by fully 
participating agencies which are stored, garaged, or operated within the 
defined mandatory use service area of a fleet management system shall 
also be consolidated into and operated under the control of that system.
    (f) Fleet management systems established under this subpart provide 
for furnishing motor vehicles and related services to executive 
agencies. So far as practicable, these services will also be furnished 
to any mixed-ownership corporation, the District of Columbia, or a 
contractor authorized under the provisions of Federal Acquisition 
Regulation, 48 CFR part 51, subpart 51.2, upon request. Such services 
may be furnished, as determined by the Administrator, GSA, through the 
use, under rental or other arrangements, of motor vehicles of private 
fleet operators, commercial companies, local or interstate common 
carriers, or Government-owned motor vehicles, or combinations thereof.

<R05>
Sec. 101-39.101  Notice of intention to begin a study.

    The Administrator, GSA, will ascertain the possibilities of 
economies to be derived through the establishment of a fleet management 
system in a specific geographical area. After preliminary investigation, 
he or she will notify the head of each agency concerned at least 30 
calendar days in advance of the intent to conduct a study to develop 
data and justification as to the feasibility of establishing a fleet 
management system. The notification, in writing, will include:

[[Page 409]]

    (a) The approximate geographical area to be included in the study, 
including a defined mandatory use service area and an optional use 
service area; and
    (b) The date on which the study will begin.

<R05>
Sec. 101-39.204  Obtaining motor vehicles for indefinite assignment.

    Motor vehicles and related services of the GSA Interagency Fleet 
Management System (IFMS) are provided to requesting agencies under the 
following procedures. When competing requests are received, priority 
will be given to a fully participating agency over an other than fully 
participating agency.
    (a) Federal agencies or parts thereof that meet the following 
conditions are considered fully participating:
    (1) All agency-owned motor vehicles have been consolidated into the 
supporting GSA IFMS fleet management center, and no agency-owned 
vehicles, with the exception of approved exemptions, are operated in the 
defined mandatory use service area of the supporting GSA fleet 
management center;
    (2) No vehicles were available to consolidate, but total reliance is 
placed on the supporting GSA IFMS fleet management center or the GSA 
IFMS as a whole to meet all motor vehicle requirements, and no agency-
owned vehicles are operated in the defined mandatory use service area of 
the supporting GSA fleet management center;
    (3) The agency would otherwise qualify under paragraph (a) (1) or 
(2) of this section but has been authorized by GSA to purchase or 
commercially lease motor vehicles because the GSA IFMS was unable to 
supply its requirements.
    (b) Fully participating agencies may request indefinite assignment 
of vehicles, regardless of number, from the supporting IFMS fleet 
management center. Assignment may be made at that level, subject to 
availability. If the required vehicles are not available, a written 
request shall be sent to the General Services Administration, Attn: FBF, 
Washington, DC, 20406. To be considered, the request shall include the 
following:
    (1) Certification that concurrence has been obtained from the 
designated agency fleet manager or other designated headquarters-level 
official and that other means of transportation are not feasible or 
cost-effective;
    (2) The number and types of vehicles required, of which passenger 
vehicles are limited to compact or smaller unless the agency head or 
designee has certified that larger vehicles are essential to the 
agency's mission;
    (3) Location where the vehicles are needed;
    (4) Date required, including earliest and latest acceptable dates;
    (5) Anticipated length of assignment;
    (6) Projected utilization, normally in terms of miles per month or 
year;
    (7) Certification of funding;

[[Page 414]]

    (8) Billing address and billed office address code (BOAC);
    (9) Agency contact, including name, address, and telephone number;
    (10) Office, program, or activity requiring the vehicles;
    (11) A statement that the agency does or does not request authority 
to commercially lease, and the anticipated duration of the lease, should 
GSA be unable to provide the vehicles.
    (c) Federal agencies that meet the following conditions are 
considered other than fully participating:
    (1) Vehicles have been acquired from other sources for reasons other 
than the inability of the GSA IFMS to supply the required vehicles, 
except those designated as exempt vehicles as determined by the GSA 
IFMS;
    (2) Cost reimbursable contractors authorized to utilize GSA IFMS 
motor vehicles when they represent participating agencies;
    (3) Other authorized users of the GSA IFMS.
    (d) Other than fully participating agencies must contact the 
supporting GSA IFMS fleet management center to ascertain vehicle 
availability, regardless of the number required. If the vehicles are 
available, assignment shall be made. When the supporting GSA IFMS fleet 
management center determines that the requested vehicles are not 
available, the requesting activity shall make a record of contact to 
document compliance with the mandatory first source of supply 
requirement. No further authorizations from GSA are required for the 
agency to execute a commercial lease from sources established by the GSA 
Automotive Commodity Center or the agency, provided that such agency has 
Congressional authority to lease motor vehicles and:
    (1) All applicable procurement regulations (e.g., Federal 
Acquisition Regulation (FAR)) and internal agency acquisition 
regulations are observed;
    (2) The requirements of part 101-38 of this chapter regarding fuel 
economy, Government identification and marking, etc., are adhered to;
    (3) The agency fleet manager or designee retains responsibility for 
fleet oversight and reporting requirements under Public Law 99-272; and
    (4) Other than fully participating agencies that choose not to 
commercially lease may utilize the procedures for full participants in 
paragraph (b) of this section, on the understanding that fully 
participating agencies will receive priority consideration.

Sec. 101-39.206  Seasonal or unusual requirements.

    Agencies or activities having seasonal, peak, or unusual 
requirements for vehicles or related services shall inform the GSA IFMS 
fleet management center as far in advance as possible. Normally, notice 
shall be given not less than 3 months in advance of the need. Requests 
for vehicles for other than indefinite assignment will usually be filled

Sec. 101-39.207  Reimbursement for services.

    (a) GSA Regional Administrators will issue, as appropriate, regional 
bulletins announcing the GSA vehicle rental rates applicable to their 
respective regions.
    (b) The using agency will be billed for GSA Interagency Fleet 
Management System (IFMS) services provided for under this part at rates 
fixed by GSA. Such rates are designed to recover all GSA IFMS fixed and 
variable costs. Rates will be reviewed and revised periodically to 
determine that reimbursement is sufficient to recover applicable costs. 
Failure by using agencies to reimburse GSA for vehicle services will be 
cause for GSA to terminate motor vehicle assignments.
    (c) IFMS services provided to authorized Government contractors and 
subcontractors will be billed to the responsible agency unless such 
agency requests that the contractor be billed directly. In case of 
nonpayment by a contractor, GSA will bill the responsible agency which 
authorized the contractor's use of GSA IFMS services.

[[Page 415]]

    (d) Using agencies will be billed for accidents and incidents as 
described in Sec. 101-39.406. Agencies may also be charged 
administrative fees when vehicles are not properly maintained, repaired, 
or when the vehicle is subject to abuse or neglect.
    (e) Agencies may be charged for recovery of expenses for repairs or 
services to GSA IFMS vehicles which are not authorized by the GSA IFMS 
either through preventive maintenance notices, approval from a GSA 
Maintenance Control Center, or approval from a GSA fleet management 
center, per instructions in the operator's guide issued with each 
vehicle. Excess costs relating to the failure to utilize self-service 
gasoline pumps or the unnecessary use of premium grade gasoline may also 
be recovered from using agencies (see Sec. 101-38.401-2 of this 
chapter).
[56 FR 59889, Nov. 26, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 101-39.208  Vehicles removed from defined areas.

    (a) Normally, vehicles shall not be permanently operated outside the 
geographical area served by the issuing GSA IFMS fleet management 
center. However, when agency programs necessitate vehicle relocation for 
a period exceeding 90 calendar days, the agency shall notify the issuing 
GSA IFMS fleet management center of the following:
    (1) The location at which the vehicles are currently in use;
    (2) The date the vehicles were moved to the present location; and
    (3) The expected date the vehicles will be returned to the original 
location.
    (b) When vehicles will be permanently relocated outside the area 
served by the issuing GSA IFMS fleet management center, the affected GSA 
IFMS fleet manager will ascertain if the using agency is fully 
participating at the new location (see Sec. 101-39.204). If this 
criterion is met, the vehicle will normally be transferred to the GSA 
IFMS fleet management center nearest the new location. If the agency is 
other than a full participant, the transfer will be treated as a request 
for additional vehicles at the new location.

   Subpart 101-39.3--Use and Care of GSA Interagency Fleet Management 
                             System Vehicles


<R05>
Sec. 101-39.300  General.

    (a) The objective of the General Services Administration (GSA) 
Interagency Fleet Management System (IFMS) is to provide efficient and 
economical motor vehicle and related services to participating agencies. 
To attain this objective, policies and procedures for use and care of 
GSA IFMS vehicles provided to an agency or activity are prescribed in 
this subpart.
    (b) To operate a motor vehicle furnished by the GSA IFMS, civilian 
employees of the Federal Government shall have a valid State, District 
of Columbia, or Commonwealth operator's license for the type of vehicle 
to be operated and some form of agency identification. Non-Government 
personnel, such as contractors, shall have a valid license for the type 
of equipment to be operated when using vehicles supplied by the GSA IFMS 
(this may include a Commercial Driver's License). All other vehicle 
operators, and Federal civilian employees that have a valid civilian 
operator's license, but not for the type of equipment to be operated, 
must have in their possession an Optional Form 346, U.S. Government 
Motor Vehicle Operator's Identification Card, for the type of equipment 
to be operated. Specific regulations covering procedures and 
qualifications of Government motor vehicle operators are contained in 5 
CFR part 930, issued by the Office of Personnel Management.
    (c) To operate a motor vehicle furnished by GSA, drivers and 
occupants shall wear safety belts whenever the vehicle is in operation. 
The vehicle operator shall ensure that all vehicle occupants are wearing 
their safety belts prior to operating the vehicle.
    (d) The use of tobacco products is prohibited in GSA IFMS motor 
vehicles. The agency to which the vehicle is assigned is responsible for 
ensuring that its employees do not use tobacco products while occupying 
IFMS vehicles. If a user agency violates this prohibition, the agency 
will be charged for

[[Page 416]]

the cost of cleaning the affected vehicle(s) beyond normal detailing 
procedures to remove tobacco odor or residue or repairing damage caused 
as a result of tobacco use. The decision to perform such additional 
cleaning or repair will be made by the GSA fleet manager based upon the 
condition of the vehicle when assigned, the degree of tobacco residue 
and damage, and the cost effectiveness of such additional cleaning.
    (e) Reasonable diligence in the care of GSA IFMS vehicles shall be 
exercised by using agencies and operators at all times. Officials or 
employees failing to take proper care of motor vehicles issued to them 
may be refused further authorization to use GSA IFMS vehicles after 
reasonable notice has been provided by GSA to the head of the local 
activity concerned.

<R05>
Sec. 101-39.301  Utilization guidelines.

    An agency must be able to justify a full-time vehicle assignment. 
The following guidelines may be employed by an agency requesting GSA 
Interagency Fleet Management System (IFMS) services. Other utilization 
factors, such as days used, agency mission, and the relative costs of 
alternatives to a full-time vehicle assignment, may be considered as 
justification where miles traveled guidelines are not met.
    (a) Passenger-carrying vehicles. The utilization guidelines for 
passenger-carrying vehicles are a minimum of 3,000 miles per quarter or 
12,000 miles per year.
    (b) Light trucks and general purpose vehicles. The utilization 
guidelines for light trucks and general purpose vehicles are as follows:
    (1) Light trucks and general purpose vehicles, 12,500 lbs. Gross 
Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) and under--10,000 miles per year.
    (2) Trucks and general purpose vehicles, over 12,500 lbs. GVWR to 
24,000 lbs. GVWR--7,500 miles per year.
    (c) Heavy trucks and truck tractors. The utilization guidelines for 
heavy trucks and truck tractors are as follows:
    (1) Heavy trucks and general purpose vehicles over 24,000 lbs. 
GVWR--7,500 miles per year.
    (2) Truck tractors--10,000 miles per year.
    (d) Other trucks and special purpose vehicles. Utilization 
guidelines for other trucks and special purpose vehicles have not been 
established. However, the head of the local office of the agency or his/
her designee shall cooperate with GSA IFMS fleet management center 
personnel in studying the use of this equipment and take necessary 
action to ensure that it is reasonably utilized or returned to the 
issuing GSA IFMS fleet management center.

Sec. 101-39.302  Rotation.

    GSA Interagency Fleet Management System (IFMS) vehicles on high 
mileage assignments may be rotated with those on low mileage assignments 
to assure more uniform overall fleet utilization. In cases where the 
continued use of a vehicle is essential but its miles traveled are not 
consistent with utilization guidelines, the using agency may be required 
to justify, in writing, retention of the vehicle. Each GSA IFMS fleet 
manager will decide on a case-by-case basis which vehicles, if any, will 
be rotated based upon vehicle type, vehicle location, location and 
availability of replacement vehicles, and the mission of the using 
agency.

(IFMS) vehicle or the permanent installation of accessory equipment on 
these vehicles may be accomplished only when approved by GSA. For the 
purpose of this regulation, permanent installation means the actual 
bolting, fitting, or securing of an item to the vehicle. Such 
modification or installation of accessory equipment must be considered 
by the agency as essential for the accomplishment of the agency's 
mission. The request for such modification or installation shall be 
forwarded to the appropriate GSA IFMS regional fleet manager for 
consideration. Accessory equipment or other after-market items which 
project an inappropriate appearance, such as radar detectors, will not 
be used on GSA IFMS vehicles. Decorative items (i.e., bumper stickers 
and decals) will not be used on IFMS vehicles unless authorized by the 
Director, Fleet Management Division, GSA.

stored and parked at locations which provide protection from pilferage 
or damage. In the interest of economy, no cost storage shall be used 
whenever practicable and feasible.
    (b) The cost of parking and storing GSA IFMS vehicles is the 
responsibility of the using agency. Prior to the procurement of other 
than temporary parking accommodations in urban centers (see Sec. 101-
l8.102), agencies shall determine the availability of Government-owned 
or -controlled parking space in accordance with the provisions of 
Sec. 101-17.101-6.

vehicle.

<R05>
Sec. 101-39.406  Responsibility for damages.

    (a) GSA will charge the using agency all costs resulting from 
damage, including vandalism, theft, and parking lot damage, to a GSA 
Interagency Fleet Management System (IFMS) vehicle which occurs during 
the period that the vehicle is assigned or issued to that agency, to an 
employee of that agency, or to the agency's authorized contractor; 
however, the using agency will not be held responsible for damages to 
the vehicle if it is determined by GSA, after a review on a case by case 
basis of the documentation required by Sec. 101-39.401, that damage to 
the vehicle occurred:
    (1) As a result of the negligent or willful act of a party other 
than the agency (or the employee of that agency) to which the vehicle 
was assigned or issued and the identity of the party can be reasonably 
determined;
    (2) As a result of mechanical failure of the vehicle, and the using 
agency (or its employee) is not otherwise negligent. Proof of mechanical 
failure must be submitted; or
    (3) As a result of normal wear and tear such as is expected in the 
operation of a similar vehicle.
    (b) Agencies using GSA IFMS services will be billed for the total 
cost of all damages resulting from neglect or abuse of assigned or 
issued GSA IFMS vehicles.
    (c) If an agency is held responsible for damages, GSA will charge to 
that agency all costs for removing and repairing the GSA IFMS vehicle. 
If the vehicle is damaged beyond economical repair, GSA will charge all 
costs to that agency, including fair market value of the vehicle less 
any salvage value. Upon request, GSA will furnish an accident report, 
where applicable, regarding the incident to the agency. Each agency 
shall be responsible for disciplining its employees who are

[[Page 420]]

guilty of damaging GSA IFMS vehicles through misconduct or improper 
operation, including inattention.
    (d) If an agency has information or facts that indicate that it was 
not responsible for an accident, the agency may furnish the data to GSA 
requesting that costs charged to and collected from it be credited to 
the agency. GSA will make the final determination of agency 
responsibility based upon Government findings, police accident reports, 
and any available witness statements.
    (e) When contractors or subcontractors of using agencies are in 
accidents involving GSA IFMS vehicles, the agency employing the 
contractor will usually be billed directly for all costs associated with 
the accident. It will be the responsibility of the using agency to 
collect accident costs from the contractor should the contractor be at 
fault.
[56 FR 59892, Nov. 26, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 101-39.407  Accident records.

    If GSA's records of vehicle accidents indicate that a particular 
activity has had an unusually high accident frequency rate or a high 
accident cost per mile, GSA will so advise the using activity. 
Corrective action will be requested and GSA will cooperate in any 
reasonable manner possible to bring about improved performance.

delegated to certain officials in the General Services Administration or 
to the head of another executive agency to represent itself pursuant to 
section 205(d) of the act (40 U.S.C. 486(d)).
    (a) With respect to carriers' tariffs, rates, and operating

Sec. 101-40.103-1  Domestic transportation.

    Preferential treatment, normally, shall not be accorded to any 
commercial mode of transportation (motor, rail, air, or water) or to any 
particular commercial carrier when arranging for domestic transportation 
services. However, where for valid reasons, a particular mode of 
transportation or a particular carrier within that mode must be used to 
meet specific program requirements and/or limitations, only that mode or 
carrier shall be considered. Examples of valid reasons for considering 
only a particular mode or carrier are (a) where only a certain mode of 
transportation or individual carrier is able to provide the needed 
service or is able to meet the required delivery date; and (b) where the 
consignee's installation and related facilities preclude or are not 
conducive to service by all modes of transportation. (See also 
Sec. 101.40.303-1.)

carriers.)
    (a) U.S.-flag ocean carriers. Arrangements for international ocean 
transportation services by privately owned U.S.-flag vessels shall be 
made in accordance with the provisions of section 901(b) of the Merchant 
Marine Act of 1936, as amended by the Cargo Preference Act of 1954, 46 
U.S.C. 1241(b). (See also 48 CFR subpart 47.5.)
    (b) U.S.-flag air carriers. Arrangements for international air 
transportation services shall be made in accordance with the so-called 
Fly America Act, as enacted by section 5 of the International Fair 
Competitive Practices Act of 1974, Public Law 93-623, January 3, 1975, 
as amended by section 21 of the International Air Transportation 
Competition Act of 1979, Public Law 96-192, February 15, 1980 (49 U.S.C.

international movement of property to the extent that services by these 
carriers are available. (See also 48 CFR subpart 47.4.)

Sec. 101-40.103-3  Coastwise transportation.

    As stated in 46 U.S.C. 883, no merchandise shall be transported by 
water, or by land and water, between points in the United States, 
including Districts, Territories, and possessions thereof embraced 
within the coastwise laws, either directly or via a foreign port, or for 
any part of the transportation, in any other vessel than a vessel built 
in and documented under laws of the United States and owned by persons 
who are citizens of the United States or vessels to which the privilege 
of engaging in coastwise trade is extended by sections 13 and 808 of 
title 46 of the United States Code. There are exceptions and limitations 
to this basic provision, especially with regard to the United States

Sec. 101-40.105  Use of Government-owned transportation equipment.

    Generally, the preferred method of transporting property for the 
Government is through use of the facilities and services of commercial 
carriers. However, under certain circumstances, Government vehicles may 
be used when they are available. They may be used for such purposes as 
local transfer of property, pickup or delivery services which are not 
performed by the commercial carriers in connection with the line-haul 
transportation, transportation of property to meet emergencies, and 
accomplishment of program objectives which cannot be attained through 
use of commercial carriers.

Sec. 101-40.106  Reports.

    Subject to the provisions of 41 CFR 201-45.6, each executive agency

for changes in agencies' policies, standards, practices, and procedures 
to improve transportation concepts and operations at all levels.

Sec. 101-40.108  Transportation seminars and workshops.

    GSA conducts transportation seminars and workshops for the benefit 
of executive agency personnel assigned functions relating to the 
movement of Government materials. The objective of this training is to 
broaden traffic management knowledge and experience within the agency 
and to enhance economy of operations. Seminars on the use of socially 
and economically disadvantaged carriers are conducted by the GSA 
regional offices in coordination with the GSA Central Office. All other 
seminars are conducted through GSA Training Center (CTD). GSA regional 
offices will conduct workshops on transportation subjects designed to 
meet specific agency needs. Agencies desiring assistance in these 
matters should direct their requests to the appropriate GSA regional 
office or to the

<R05>
Sec. 101-40.109-1  Miscellaneous transportation-related contracts and agreements.

    (a) The GSA Central Office or the appropriate GSA regional office 
will, as considered necessary, enter into agreements or contracts for 
transportation and related services, including but not limited to 
stevedoring, storage, drayage, packing, marking, ocean freight 
forwarding, accessorial services, demurrage, and weighing. (See 41 CFR 
101-41.304-2 for the use of commerical forms and procedures instead of 
Government bills of lading.) These contracts and agreements will be made 
for and in behalf of all executive agencies.
    (b) The availability of these contracts and agreements will be 
announced through GSA bulletins which will outline the specific 
contractual services and the terms of the agreements. After distribution 
of these bulletins, GSA will furnish copies of the contracts and 
agreements to agencies upon request.

Sec. 101-40.109-2  Office relocation contracts.

    (a) Prior to entering into office relocation contracts, agencies 
should ensure they are complying with the provisions of FPMR Temp. Reg. 
D-73, or reissues thereof. (See 41 CFR appendix to subchapter D.) 
Compliance assistance may be obtained from the respective regional 
directors of the GSA Public Buildings Service, Real Estate Division.
    (b) An agency may either enter into its own office relocation 
contracts or request the appropriate GSA regional office to enter into 
office relocation contracts on the agency's behalf. Requests to GSA 
should be made as soon as possible and at least 120 calendar days before 
the proposed date of the move for local office relocation moves. The 
agency shall furnish the GSA such pertinent information concerning the 
proposed relocation as origin, destination, moving date, an itemized 
inventory of property to be moved, and the name and telephone number of 
the agency relocation coordinator.
    (1) Arrangements for moving services, other than local office 
relocation moves, will be contracted for using competitive procedures or 
other appropriate relocation arrangements including Government tenders 
pursuant to section 10721 of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 U.S.C. 
10721).
    (2) Local office relocation moves must be acquired by contract, 
since such moves qualify as transportation within ``commercial zones or 
terminal areas'' and are excepted from rate regulation by the Interstate 
Commerce Commission. Neither the statutory exemption provided for in 
paragraph (3) of section 7 of the McNamara-O'Hara Service Contract Act 
of 1965 (Service Contract Act) (41 U.S.C. 351 et seq.) exempting ``any 
contract for the carriage of freight or personnel * * * where published 
tariff rates are in effect'' nor the administrative exemption for 
contracts for the carriage of freight or personnel subject to rates 
covered by section 10721 of the Interstate Commerce Act is applicable. 
(See 29 CFR 4.123.) The Service Contract Act applies to local office 
relocation moves where transportation costs (such as packing, crating, 
handling, loading, and/or storage of goods prior to or following line-
haul transportation) are incidental to the principal purpose of the 
contract. (See 29 CFR 4.118.)
    (c) GSA regional offices, on behalf of executive agencies, may enter 
into term contracts for office relocation services in cities where it is 
determined that such contracts are warranted. The availability of term 
contracts for office relocation services will be announced through GSA 
bulletins as indicated in Sec. 101-40.109-1(b).

[[Page 426]]

    (d) Whether an office relocation is made under a GSA term moving 
contract or under a specific contract entered into by GSA in behalf of 
an individual agency, the agency being relocated shall make operational 
arrangements directly with the moving contractor. These arrangements 
shall include:
    (1) Issuing the purchase order or placing the work order;
    (2) Arranging for direct billing;
    (3) Supervising the actual move;
    (4) Processing loss and damage claims, if any;
    (5) Providing certification on the contractor's invoices; and
    (6) Processing the invoice for direct payment to the contractor.

The GSA contracting office shall be notified upon completion of the 
relocation and is prepared to provide technical assistance as necessary.

Sec. 101-40.109-3  Mandatory use of transportation-related contracts and agreements.

    (a) When a contract or agreement for transportation-related 
services, including office relocations, is awarded in response to an 
agency's specific request, the use of the contract or agreement is 
mandatory for that requesting agency.
    (b) When term contracts or agreements for transportation-related 
services, excluding office relocations, are entered into and awarded by 
GSA for use ``as required,'' the term contract or agreement is mandatory 
upon all executive agencies; however, exceptions to the mandatory use of 
term contracts or agreements may be granted by the appropriate GSA 
regional office.
    (c) GSA may enter into optional use contracts for office relocations 
where deemed appropriate.

an interstate tariff file sufficient to meet the normal requirements of 
executive agencies located within its regional area of responsibility. 
Each GSA regional office will maintain an intrastate tariff file on 
those States located within the limits of its jurisdiction, except that 
when the transportation needs of client agencies require it to do so, a 
GSA regional office may maintain other intrastate tariffs.
    (b) Executive agencies may maintain only those tariffs necessary to 
meet their routine operational requirements. Agencies may use GSA tariff 
files to meet unusual or abnormal transportation needs; or, 
alternatively, may request GSA to furnish rates, freight routings, or 
other tariff information. (See Sec. 101-40.301 for use of GSA-furnished

Sec. 101-40.200  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart prescribes regulations concerning the movement of 
household goods of Government employees and their dependents who are 
eligible for relocation within the conterminous United States. As used 
in this subpart, the term ``household goods'' includes personal effects, 
and the term ``employee(s)'' includes eligible dependents. GSA will 
provide agencies with cost comparisons, the names of carriers eligible 
to handle specific shipments, and requested administrative support 
related to the Government employee's household goods movements. When GSA 
furnishes agencies cost comparisons between the GBL method (see 
Sec. 101-40.203-2) and the commuted rate system (see Sec. 101-40.203-3), 
the agencies shall make the final determination as to the method of 
shipment and to the selection of the carrier under the GBL method.

<R05>
Sec. 101-40.203-2  The GBL method.

    (a) For the purposes of the centralized household goods traffic 
management program described in this subpart 101-40.2, shipments of 
Government employees' household goods authorized to move under a 
Government bill of lading (GBL) are classified as ``GBL method'' 
shipments. This method is distinguishable from the commuted rate system 
(Sec. 101-40.203-3) in that when a GBL is used, the Government, not the 
employee, is the shipper and the Government pays the carrier the 
applicable transportation charges. The decision on which method shall be 
authorized is the decision of the employing agency, and shall be based 
on a cost comparison (see Sec. 101-40.203-4) which the agency obtains 
from the appropriate GSA regional office specified in Sec. 101-40.101-1 
or an agency office delegated authority to furnish cost comparisons. The 
cost comparison shall contain the name(s) of the carrier(s) eligible to 
handle the household goods shipment. When a shipment moves under a GBL, 
the agency prepares the bill of lading, books the shipment, and in event 
of loss or damage to the household goods may either file claims directly 
with the carrier, on behalf of the employee, or assist the employee in 
filing claims against the carrier.
    (b) When the agency makes the final determination that the GBL 
method shall be used, the Government's financial obligation for the cost 
of shipping the employee's household goods is established. Once the GBL 
method is authorized and an employee chooses to move all or part of his/
her household goods by some other means (see paragraphs (c) and (d) of 
this section), the Government's financial responsibility toward the 
employee for shipping costs is limited to the cost which the Government 
would have incurred had all the household goods been moved on one GBL, 
in one lot, from one origin to one destination, by the lowest cost 
carrier providing the level of service required by the agency at the 
time the GBL method was authorized.
    (c) When an employee requests, for personal reasons, that his/her 
household goods be shipped by a carrier that is more costly than the 
carrier selected by the agency, the Government will pay the carrier's 
applicable charges and collect from the employee any additional 
transportation costs resulting from the employee's choice of carrier. 
Agencies are cautioned to counsel employees regarding their potential 
indebtedness to the Government when employees select a higher cost 
carrier.
    (d) When an employee chooses to use a rental truck, trailer, or 
private conveyance to transport his/her household goods, the Government 
will reimburse the employee his/her actual expenses (e.g., vehicle 
rental fee, material handling equipment, packaging materials, fuel, toll 
charges, etc.) not to exceed

[[Page 429]]

the maximum amount described in paragraph (b) of this section.

Sec. 101-40.203-3  The commuted rate system.

    The commuted rate system is the method whereby employees who are 
authorized to transport their household goods at Government expense make 
their own shipping arrangements and are reimbursed by the Government 
according to the commuted rate allowances published in the GSA Commuted 
Rate Schedule. In addition to transportation allowances, the commuted 
rate schedule includes allowances for various related accessorial 
expenses, such as packing and crating, storage-in-transit, carrier labor 
charges, appliance servicing, and piano/organ handling. Under the 
commuted rate system, employees shipping via commercial carriers are 
responsible for making all arrangements with the carrier, filing loss 
and damage claims with the carrier, and making payment to the carrier 
after the shipment has been completed. Under the commuted rate system, 
the shipment is moved using commercial documents, or employees may elect 
to transport their household goods in a rental vehicle or by private 
conveyance. The use of household goods rate tenders (see Sec. 101-
40.203-1) is not authorized when household goods are shipped under the 
commuted rate system.

<R05>
Sec. 101-40.203-4  Cost comparisons.

    (a) Under the centralized household goods traffic management 
program, agencies shall obtain cost comparisons between the GBL method 
and the commuted rate system from the appropriate GSA regional office. 
Section 302-8.3(c)(4)(i) of the Federal Travel Regulation (41 CFR 
chapters 301 through 304) provides that the commuted rate system shall 
be used for individual employee transfers without consideration being 
given to the GBL method, except that the GBL method may be used if the 
actual transportation costs (including the costs of packing and other 
accessorial services) to be incurred by the Government are predetermined 
and can be expected to result in a real saving to the Government of $100 
or more.
    (b) Requests for cost comparisons shall be made as far in advance of 
the moving date as possible (preferably 30 calendar days) and shall 
contain the following information:
    (1) Name of employee to be moved;
    (2) Origin city, county, and State;
    (3) Destination city, county, and State;
    (4) Anticipated or actual date household goods are to be picked up;
    (5) Estimated weight of shipments;
    (6) Number of days storage-in-transit is required (if applicable); 
and
    (7) Other pertinent data.
    (c) Agencies should use GSA Form 2485, Cost Comparison for Shipping 
Household Goods (Commuted Rate System Vs. GBL Method) for this purpose. 
(See Sec. 101-40.4902.) In case of an emergency or an imminent moving 
date (less than 10 workdays), these details may be transmitted to the 
appropriate GSA regional office by phone. If information is received by 
phone, the response will be made by phone when requested. Regardless, 
all cost comparisons and carrier selection information will be confirmed 
in writing by the appropriate GSA regional office.

Eligible carriers are those carriers which meet minimum service criteria 
established by GSA. Additionally, eligible carriers will be evaluated 
and ranked on the cost comparison (see Sec. 101-40.203-4) based on 
completed GSA Forms 3080, Household Goods Carrier Evaluation Report (see 
Sec. 101-40.205), submitted to GSA by Federal employees. Agencies 
authorizing the GBL method shall select the eligible carrier that meets 
the agency's service requirements and offers the lowest cost consistent 
therewith. Deviations from

[[Page 430]]

this methodology shall be documented in the requesting agency's records.

Sec. 101-40.205  Quality control.

    GSA Form 3080, Household Goods Carrier Evaluation Report (see 
Sec. 101-40.4902), is a form used by GSA and other agencies for 
monitoring the performance and quality of household goods carriers' 
service. When household goods shipments are made under the GBL method, 
the employee (following delivery of the shipment) should promptly 
complete his/her portion of GSA form 3080 and send it to the agency GBL 
issuing officer responsible for the shipment to complete and forward to 
the Manager, GSA Centralized Household Goods Traffic Management Program, 
General Services Administration (6FBX), 1500 East Bannister Road, Kansas 
City, MO 64131. Information compiled from completed GSA Forms 3080 is 
used by GSA and other agencies to evaluate and rate the quality of 
carrier service and to determine if actions under Sec. 101-40.208 should 
be considered. Agencies may submit other documentation of instances of 
inadequate carrier service or performance to the Manager, GSA 
Centralized Household Goods Traffic Management Program, General Services 
Administration (6FBX), 1500 East Bannister Road, Kansas City, MO 64131.

<R05>
Sec. 101-40.206  Household goods carriers' liability.

    The GSA tender of service (TOS) agreement and the carriers' 
applicable tariffs establish the carriers' minimum liability for the 
loss of or damage to Government employees' household goods transported 
in conjunction with this subpart. A value exceeding the established TOS 
or tariff minimum may be declared on the bill of lading, but the carrier 
will charge a valuation fee for each $100, or fraction thereof, of such 
higher declared valuation. Employees should be fully informed as to the 
extent the Government will be monetarily responsible for the 
transportation of household goods, the differences in standard liability 
under Government and commercial bills of lading, the steps necessary to 
increase or decrease the carriers' liability, and the relative advantage 
the employee would have under the Military Personnel and Civilian 
Employees' Claims Act of 1964 (see Sec. 101-40.207(b)) when the employee 
chooses to declare a valuation that either exceeds (in which case, the 
employee is liable for an excess valuation charge) or does not exceed 
the TOS or tariff minimum.
    (a) When a Government employee's household goods are shipped under a 
GBL via carriers participating in the GSA Centralized Household Goods 
Traffic Management Program, the TOS agreement establishes the carrier's 
minimum liability for loss or damage, and the carrier's tender or tariff 
prescribes any additional charges for which the Government may be 
responsible relative to that liability. In the absence of an employee's 
written request for a valuation that exceeds the minimum liability 
specified in the TOS agreement, all GBLs should be annotated to show the 
minimum liability specified in the TOS agreement. If an employee 
requests the agency to declare a valuation that exceeds the TOS minimum, 
the agency will enter the declaration on the GBL, pay the carrier the 
valuation fee (if applicable), and collect the fee from the employee. 
Should the employee's request for increased valuation be made after the 
GBL has been tendered to the carrier but before the shipment has been 
picked up, the employee should not make a separate arrangement with the 
carrier for increased valuation. Instead, the employee should notify the 
GBL issuing officer of the valuation desired, and request that the 
original GBL be amended on Standard Form 1200, Government Bill of Lading 
Correction Notice. (See Sec. 101-41.4901-1200.)
    (b) When a Government employee's household goods are shipped under 
the commuted rate system, the employee makes all arrangements for moving 
his/her household goods, and is reimbursed to the extent provided in the

[[Page 431]]

commuted rate schedule. If the employee chooses to have his/her 
household goods transported by a commercial carrier, the shipment will 
move on a commercial bill of lading. The carrier's tariff establishes 
the standard level of carrier liability when the shipper fails to 
declare a value on the bill of lading, prescribes the options the 
shipper has for increasing or decreasing the carrier's standard 
liability, and sets the valuation fee payable when the declared value 
exceeds the minimum carrier liability for which no valuation fee 
applies. To limit the carrier to the minimum liability and avoid having 
to pay a valuation fee, the shipper must annotate the bill of lading in 
accordance with the provisions of the tariff.

<R05>
Sec. 101-40.207  Household goods loss and damage claims.

    (a) Claims for loss and damage to household goods will normally be 
filed and processed with the line-haul carrier; i.e., the carrier to 
which the household goods were tendered and which is shown on the bill 
of lading as having received the shipment. Depending on agency policy, 
claims for the repair, replacement, or loss of household goods may be 
filed by either the agency or the employee (as owner of the goods). When 
the employee files the claim, the agency or the appropriate GSA regional 
office will furnish the employee necessary assistance in claim 
procedures.
    (b) Under 31 U.S.C. 3721 (the Military Personnel and Civilian 
Employees' Claims Act of 1964, as amended), employees who sustain a loss 
or damage to their household goods (transported incident to service) 
that exceeds the amount recovered from a carrier in settlement of a 
claim may file claim against the United States for the difference. 
Pursuant to Public Law 100-565, agencies may compensate employees up to 
$40,000 on claims arising on or after October 31, 1988. When it is the 
policy of the agency not to compensate its employees under the Act, the 
agency should advise employees of the options available to them for 
insuring their household goods against greater monetary loss. (See 
Sec. 101-40.206(b) of this subpart.)
    (c) When settling a claim for loss or damage to a shipment of 
household goods, carriers may settle either for the full value declared 
by the shipper or arrive at the current actual value of the lost or 
damaged item by using the criterion of replacement cost of the lost or 
damaged item, less depreciation. The basis upon which carriers will 
settle a claim is contained in carriers' tariffs or is referenced in

Sec. 101-40.301  GSA rate and routing services.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, executive agencies 
shall obtain rate and/or routing information from the appropriate GSA 
regional office when they have general freight or household goods 
shipments categorized as follows:

 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
             Shipment category                     Shipment weight
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Surface shipments other than household      10,000 pounds and over, or
 goods. (See Sec.  101-40.305-3 for          shipments (regardless of
 exemption.).                                weight) that occupy the
                                             full visible capacity (see
                                             note) of a railcar or a
                                             tractor-trailer
                                             combination(s)
Air shipments.............................  1,000 pounds and over
Household goods shipments.................  All shipments, regardless of
                                             weight (except will not
                                             apply on shipments moving
                                             in foreign commerce; see
                                             101-40.101-1(b)). (See
                                             subpart 101-40.2 for
                                             shipments moving within the
                                             conterminous U.S.)
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Note: Full visible capacity generally means that quantity of freight 
which in the manner loaded so fills a vehicle that no additional article 
in the shipping form tendered identical in size to the largest article 
in the shipment can be loaded in or on the vehicle. Consult governing 
tariffs for precise definition and application.

    (1) Unless otherwise revoked by the GSA Central Office, permanent 
exemption from the rate and routing requirements of this section is 
granted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Department of 
Energy (DOE), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and 
the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to the following 
extent:
    (i) FEMA: Initial positioning of mobile homes shipped in response to 
disasters;
    (ii) DOE: Priority energy and classified defense and nuclear waste 
management shipments;
    (iii) NASA: Shipments of key, critical items necessary to the 
success of space and aerospace research, development, acquisition, 
flight or launch activities; and
    (iv) USDA: Emergency shipments of forest firefighting materials and 
equipment; household goods shipments to and from isolated areas.
    (2) To meet other transportation exigencies of a critical and 
recurring nature, executive agencies, other than those exempted to the 
extent noted in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, may request the 
appropriate GSA regional office to grant a temporary exemption from the 
routing requirements of this section. In a local emergency, which 
precludes the requesting of routing instructions in accordance with the 
requirements of this section, routing by any transportation mode may be 
made without prior approval. Requests for temporary exemption shall be 
in writing, and the appropriate GSA regional office will accept or deny 
the request by written instructions to the requesting agency. Exemptions 
will be granted for a duration of time not to exceed 1 year; however, on 
written request, an exemption may be renewed or extended.
    (b) Agencies shall submit requests for rate and routing information 
to the appropriate GSA regional office. Agencies may telephone urgent 
requests, and replies will be made by telephone and confirmed upon 
request by the use of GSA Form 420, Freight Rate and Route Request/
Response, or GSA Form 2485, as appropriate. (See Sec. 101-40.4902.)
    (1) To obtain rate and routing information, agencies will furnish 
the necessary details concerning the shipment as far in advance of the 
proposed shipping date as possible. For freight shipments, GSA Form 420 
may be used. The procedures in subpart 101-40.2 shall be followed when 
requesting household goods rate and route information on shipments 
moving within the conterminous United States.
    (2) To eliminate the need for repetitive routing instructions, GSA 
regional offices may issue standing route orders to cover normal 
repetitive movements (two or more shipments per month) of specific items 
between specified points by any mode of transportation. Ordinarily, a 
standing route order will be issued when the origin, destination, 
commodity(ies), and frequency of shipment constitute a repetitive 
traffic pattern. GSA regional offices will maintain a standing route 
order file and review routings at 60-day intervals from the date of 
their issuance to assure current application

[[Page 433]]

of rates, ratings, routes, and classification. When required by changed 
conditions, GSA regional offices shall provide the requesting agency 
with revised routing instructions.
    (c) Agencies are encouraged, but not required, to request GSA-
furnished rate or routing information for their freight shipments that 
are less than the shipment weights specified in paragraph (a) of this 
section.
    (d) Executive agency shippers will comply with all Federal, State, 
and local laws and regulations relating to vehicular size and weight 
limitations.

<R05>
Sec. 101-40.302  Standard routing principle.

    Shipments shall be routed using the mode of transportation, or 
individual carrier or carriers within the mode, that can provide the 
required service at the lowest overall delivered cost to the Government.


<R05>
Sec. 101-40.303  Application of the standard routing principle.

    In the application of the standard routing principle, the principal 
factors for consideration, in their relative order of importance, are: 
Satisfactory service, aggregate delivered cost, least fuel-consumptive 
carrier/mode, and equitable distribution of traffic.
[51 FR 24336, July 3, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 101-40.303-1  Service requirements.

    The following factors shall be considered in determining whether a 
carrier or mode of transportation can meet an agency's transportation 
service requirements for each individual shipment:
    (a) Availability and suitability of carrier equipment;
    (b) Shipping and receiving facilities at origin and destination;
    (c) Pickup and/or delivery service (including inside pickup or 
delivery), if required;
    (d) Availability of required accessorial and special services, if 
needed;
    (e) Estimated time in transit;
    (f) Record of past performance of the carrier; and
    (g) Transit privileges when available.


<R05>
Sec. 101-40.303-2  Aggregate delivered costs.

    When comparing aggregate delivered costs to determine the most 
economical routing of shipments consistent with service requirements, 
consideration will be given to all factors which increase costs to the 
shipping or receiving activity. In addition to the actual transportation 
rates and charges, other cost factors, such as packing, blocking, 
bracing, dunnage, drayage, loading, and unloading, should be considered 
where these items affect overall costs.
[51 FR 24336, July 3, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 101-40.303-3  Most fuel efficient carrier/mode.

    When more than one mode, or more than one carrier within a mode, can 
satisfy the service requirements of a specific shipment at the same 
lowest aggregate delivered cost, the carrier/mode determined to be the 
most fuel efficient shall be selected. In determining the most fuel 
efficient carrier/mode, consideration shall be given to such factors as 
use of the carrier's equipment in ``turn around'' service, proximity of 
carrier equipment to the shipping activity, and ability of carriers to 
provide the most direct service to the destination points.


<R05>
Sec. 101-40.303-4  Equitable distribution of traffic among carriers.

    When more than one mode of transportation or more than one carrier 
within a mode can provide equally satisfactory service at the same 
aggregate cost and all modes are equally fuel efficient, the traffic 
shall be distributed as equally as practicable among the modes and among 
the carriers within the modes. When socially or economically 
disadvantaged carriers and women-owned carriers are among the eligible 
competing carriers, positive action will be taken to include such 
carriers in the equitable distribution of traffic.
[51 FR 24336, July 3, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 101-40.304  Description of property for shipment.

    (a) Each shipment shall be described on the bill of lading or other 
shipping

[[Page 434]]

document as specified by the governing freight classification, carrier's 
tariff, or rate tender. Shipments shall be described as specifically as 
possible. Trade names such as ``Foamite'' or ``Formica'' or general 
terms such as ``vehicles,'' ``furniture,'' or ``Government supplies,'' 
shall not be used as bill of lading descriptions.
    (b) Hazardous materials, such as explosives, flammable liquids, 
flammable solids, oxidizers, poison A, or poison B, shall be prepared 
for shipment and described on bills of lading or other shipping 
documents in accordance with the Department of Transportation Hazardous 
Materials Regulations, subchapter C, title 49 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations.
    (c) Agencies which transport, or offer for transportation, hazardous 
waste, as described in 40 CFR part 261, for off-site treatment, storage, 
or disposal are subject to regulations of the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) and the Department of Transportation (DOT). The EPA and 
DOT, in a joint rulemaking effort, have developed a manifest system to 
ensure that hazardous waste designated for delivery to an off-site 
treatment, storage, or disposal facility actually reaches its 
destination. The central element of the system is the ``manifest,'' a 
control and transport document that accompanies hazardous waste from its 
point of generation to its point of destination. Accordingly, agencies 
shall observe the provisions of 40 CFR parts 260, 261, 262, and 271 and 
49 CFR parts 171 and 172, as required.
    (d) Agency requests for specific freight descriptions shall be 
submitted to the appropriate GSA regional office.

Sec. 101-40.305-1  Negotiations by GSA.

    Except as provided in Sec. 101-40.305-3, GSA regional offices will, 
on behalf of executive agencies, conduct all transportation negotiations 
with carriers to establish or modify rates, charges, ratings, services, 
and rules or regulations pertaining thereto.

<R05>
Sec. 101-40.305-2  Cost analysis required on substantial movements.

    Except as provided in Sec. 101-40.305-3, executive agencies shall 
submit to the appropriate GSA regional office complete information 
concerning planned transportation so that a cost analysis may be made to 
determine whether negotiation is appropriate. This information should be 
submitted as far in advance of the planned transporation as possible. 
The information supplied shall be detailed and shall include property 
characteristics (those requiring shipment in bags, boxes, or bulk; 
hazardous properties; weight; dimension; density; value; and 
susceptibility to damage), origin, destination, number of shipments, 
weight per shipment, planned shipping schedule, and planned required 
delivery date.
[51 FR 24336, July 3, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 101-40.305-3  Negotiations by other executive agencies.

    Except for the transportation of household goods under subpart 101-
40.2 and where GSA has not entered into office relocation contracts 
pursuant to Sec. 101-40.109-2, executive agencies are authorized to 
negotiate with carriers in establishing or modifying rates, charges, 
classification ratings, services, and rules or regulations pertaining 
thereto under the following conditions:
    (a) When the total quantity of property to be shipped does not 
exceed 100,000 pounds per shipment or when the known aggregate of more 
than one shipment will not exceed 100,000 pounds.

    Note: Agencies making surface shipments under agency-negotiated 
rates as authorized in this section are exempt from obtaining GSA rate 
and routing information as required in Sec. 101-40.301(a).

    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) When the planned shipment is less than that which would require 
the assessment of carload or truckload rates.
    (d) When approval to negotiate is granted by the GSA Central Office 
or the appropriate GSA regional office.


[[Page 435]]


    Note: Section 101-40.305-3 does not prohibit executive agencies from 
seeking GSA assistance in negotiations.

<R05>
Sec. 101-40.306  Rate tenders to the Government.

    Under the provisions of section 10721 of the Revised Interstate 
Commerce Act (49 U.S.C. 10721), common carriers are permitted to submit 
tenders to the Government which contain transportation rates and/or 
charges for accessorial services that are lower than those published in 
tariffs applicable to the general public. In addition, rate tenders may 
be applied to shipments other than those made by the Government provided 
the total benefits accrue to the Government; that is, provided the 
Government pays the charges or directly and completely reimburses the 
party that initially pays the freight charges (Interpretation of 
Government Rate Tariff for Eastern Central Motor Carriers Association, 
Inc., 332 I.C.C. 161 (1968)).
[51 FR 24337, July 3, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 101-40.306-1  Recommended rate tender format.

    (a) Executive agencies will use only those rate tenders which 
carriers have submitted in writing. Carriers should be encouraged to use 
Optional Form 280, Uniform Tender of Rates and/or Charges for 
Transportation Services, when preparing and submitting rate tenders to 
the Government. Optional Form 280 (see Sec. 101-40.4903) is approved by 
the Office of Management and Budget under OMB control number 3090-0038. 
Rate tenders that are ambiguous in meaning shall be resolved in favor of 
the Government; therefore, explicit terms and conditions are necessary 
to preclude misunderstandings by the parties to the rate tender.
    (b) Carriers may purchase Optional Form 280 from the Superintendent 
of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402, or 
print it commercially. When ordering this form from the Superintendent 
of Documents, specify national stock number 7540-01-092-8057. When 
printing this form commercially, carriers shall ensure that the form 
conforms to the same size, wording, and arrangement of the approved 
optional form and, while no minimum grade or paper is set, carriers 
shall provide a reasonable grade of paper stock.

<R05>
Sec. 101-40.306-2  Required shipping documents and annotations.

    (a) To qualify for transportation under section 10721 rates, 
property must be shipped by or for the Government on:
    (1) Government bills of lading;
    (2) Commercial bills of lading endorsed to show that these bills of 
lading are to be converted to Government bills of lading after delivery 
to the consignee; or
    (3) Commercial bills of lading showing that the Government is either 
the consignor or the consignee and endorsed with the following 
statement:

    Transportation hereunder is for the (name the specific agency, such 
as the General Services Administration) and the actual total 
transportation charges paid to the carrier(s) by the consignor or 
consignee are assignable to, and are to be reimbursed by, the 
Government.

    (b) When a rate tender is used for transportation furnished under a 
cost-reimbursable contract, the following endorsement shall be used on 
covering commercial bills of lading:

    Transportation hereunder is for the (name the specific agency, such 
as the General Services Administration), and the actual total 
transportation charges paid to the carrier(s) by the consignor or 
consignee are to be reimbursed by the Government, pursuant to cost 
reimbursable contract number (__).
    This may be confirmed by contacting the agency representative at 
(name and telephone number). (See 332 ICC 161.)

    (c) To ensure proper application of a Government rate tender on all 
shipments qualifying for their use, the issuing officer shall show on 
the bills of lading covering these shipments the applicable rate tender 
number and carrier identification, such as, ``ABC Transportation 
Company, Tender ICC No. 374.'' In addition, if commercial bills of 
lading are used, they shall be endorsed as specified in paragraph (a) or 
(b) of this section, as necessary.

[[Page 436]]


<R05>
Sec. 101-40.306-3  Distribution.

    Each agency receiving rate tenders shall promptly submit one signed 
copy to the National Capital Region (NCR) office listed in Sec. 101-
40.101-1(a) and two copies (including at least one signed copy) to the 
General Services Administration, Office of Transportation Audits (FW), 
Washington, DC 20405.
[51 FR 24337, July 3, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 101-40.306-4  Bill of lading endorsements.

    To ensure application of Government rate tenders to all shipments 
qualifying for their use, bills of lading covering the shipments shall 
be endorsed with the applicable tender or quotation number and carrier 
identification; e.g., ``Section 10721 quotation, ABC Transportation 
Company, Tender I.C.C. No. 143.'' In addition, where commercial bills of 
lading are used rather than Government bills of lading, the commercial 
bills of lading shall be endorsed in conformance with the provisions set 
forth in Sec. 101-40.306-2(a). (For specific regulations covering 
transportation generated under cost-reimbursement type contracts, see 48 
CFR 47.104-3.)

    Subpart 101-40.4--Temporary Nonuse, Debarment, and Suspension of 
                                Carriers


<R05>
Sec. 101-40.400  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart prescribes:
    (a) Policies and procedures governing the temporary nonuse, 
debarment, and suspension of commercial carriers transporting freight or 
household goods for the account of civilian executive agencies;
    (b) Provisions for the listing of temporary nonuse, debarred, or 
suspended carriers; and
    (c) Treatment to be accorded carriers which are placed in temporary 
nonuse, debarred, or suspended status.
[51 FR 24337, July 3, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 101-40.401  Policy.

    (a) Executive agencies shall obtain transportation services from 
responsible commercial carriers providing consistent and satisfactory 
service to meet an agency's needs. Temporary nonuse, debarment, and 
suspension are discretionary actions which, when taken in accordance 
with this subpart, are appropriate means to implement this policy.
    (b) The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), codified at 48 CFR 
subpart 9.4, implements on a Government-wide basis the uniform policies 
and procedures governing the debarment and suspension of Government 
contractors, promulgated by the Office of Federal Procurement Policy 
(OFPP), Office of Management and Budget, in Policy Letter 82-1, issued 
June 24, 1982 (47 FR 28854, July 1, 1982), and shall apply to contracts 
for transportation (including bills of lading). A Government bill of 
lading (GBL) is a contract for transportation services. (See 41 CFR 101-
41.302-2(a)(1).) A commercial bill of lading is also a contract for 
transportation services.
    (c) Temporary nonuse is not governed by OFPP Policy Letter 82-1 
since temporary nonuse does not have Government-wide effect and may be 
initiated by agency transportation officers. Debarment and suspension, 
however, shall only be imposed by the designated official specified in 
this subpart.
    (d) Debarment or suspension of a carrier precludes the executive 
agency, including the Department of Defense, from awarding such carrier 
a contract for transportation.
    (e) Agencies shall establish appropriate procedures to implement the 
policies and procedures of this subpart.
[51 FR 24337, July 3, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 101-40.402  General.

    (a) Temporary nonuse may be imposed by an authorized agency 
transportation officer for the causes set forth in Sec. 101-40.408-2. 
This action should be taken when a carrier's failure to provide adequate 
service indicates that the carrier's continued participation poses a 
risk to effective operation of agency transportation programs. Temporary 
nonuse is a localized program response to service failures which the 
carrier can readily correct during a period of limited exclusion.
    (b) Debarment is designed to protect the Government by excluding a 
carrier

[[Page 437]]

for a specified period of time following completion of an investigation 
or legal proceeding. A carrier may be debarred for willful and/or 
persistent service failures or if the agency's debarring official 
determines that a Governmentwide exclusion of the carrier is necessary 
to ensure the integrity of Government transportation programs. The 
agency's transportation officer shall refer carriers to the agency's 
debarring official in accordance with 48 CFR 9.406, if the carrier has 
willfully and/or persistently failed to comply with its contractual 
obligations under the terms and conditions of any contract for 
transportation. Referrals for criminal and/or civil fraud prosecutions 
should be made by the agency's Inspector General or an equivalent 
official.
    (c) Suspension is designed to protect the Government pending the 
outcome of a legal proceeding or investigation concerning criminal 
activity, civil fraud, or antitrust violations concerning contractual 
relations with the Government. When the agency transportation officer 
suspects that a carrier has engaged in such conduct, the matter should 
be referred to the agency's Inspector General or an equivalent official.

Sec. 101-40.408  Temporary nonuse.


<R05>
Sec. 101-40.408-1  General.

    The agency's authorized transportation officer may, in the best 
interest of the Government, place a carrier in temporary nonuse for a 
period not to exceed 90 consecutive days for any of the causes contained 
in Sec. 101-40.408-2 using the procedures in Sec. 101-40.408-3, except 
that if a carrier fails within the period specified to correct the 
cause(s) for which temporary nonuse was imposed, the period of nonuse 
will be extended an additional 30 days for debarment referral. The 
existence of a cause for temporary nonuse under Sec. 101-40.408-2 does 
not necessarily require that a carrier be placed in temporary nonuse; 
the seriousness of the carrier's acts or omissions and any mitigating 
factors should be considered in making a temporary nonuse decision. A 
carrier placed in temporary nonuse is excluded from participating in the 
agency's transportation activities and programs to the extent and for 
the period specified. The extent or scope of temporary nonuse may be 
limited to those agency transportation facilities which have experienced 
the problems leading to the imposition of temporary nonuse on which may 
be reasonably expected to experience similar problems. Temporary nonuse 
shall not be extended to unaffected facilities solely for punitive 
reasons or to damage the carrier's operations.

    (a) Willful violations of the terms of the tariffs, tenders of 
service, commercial or Government bills of lading, or similar 
arrangements determining the relationship of the parties;
    (b) Persistent and/or willful failure to meet requested packing/

transit times established for shipments from agencies or the GSA Federal 
Supply Service distribution centers;
    (d) Failure to meet required delivery dates on commercial or 
Government bills of lading;
    (e) Failure to furnish and use clean and safe vehicles and freight 
handling equipment;

seals, or improper loading, blocking, packing, or bracing of property;
    (h) Excessive damage or loss to material transported;
    (i) Improper routing;
    (j) Failure to pay just debts so as to subject Government shipments 
to possible frustration, unlawful seizure, or detention;
    (k) Failure to maintain insurance coverage;
    (l) Operating without legal authority;
    (m) Failure to settle claims in accordance with applicable 
Government regulations; and

<R05>
Sec. 101-40.408-3  Procedures.

    (a) Investigation and referral. Agencies shall prescribe procedures 
for placing a carrier in temporary nonuse. Further, the procedures shall 
provide that a carrier which fails, within the period of temporary 
nonuse, to correct the cause(s) for which temporary nonuse was imposed 
shall be referred to the

[[Page 440]]

agency's debarring official for appropriate action.
    (b) Notice of proposal to place a carrier in temporary nonuse. The 
carrier shall be notified by certified mail with return receipt 
requested of the following information:
    (1) The effective dates of the proposed temporary nonuse;
    (2) The extent or scope of the proposed temporary nonuse including 
the specific transportation facilities to which the period of exclusion 
will be applicable;
    (3) The facts relied on to support the specified cause(s) for 
temporary nonuse;
    (4) A period of 7 calendar days from the date the transportation 
officer's notice is received during which the carrier may submit in 
person, in writing, or through a representative, rebuttal information 
and arguments opposing the temporary nonuse;
    (5) A period of 5 workdays during which the transportation officer 
will evaluate the carrier's rebuttal information and opposing arguments 
and render a decision;
    (6) The availability of an appeal of the transportation officer's 
decision to a reviewing official, provided the request for review is 
received within 5 work days of receipt of the transportation officer's 
decision;
    (7) The corrective action required by the carrier to be removed from 
temporary nonuse; and
    (8) An additional nonuse period of 30 calendar days during which the 
carrier that fails to correct the cause(s) for temporary nonuse will be 
referred to the agency's debarring official for appropriate action.
    (c) Decision-making process. (1) Agencies shall prescribe procedures 
governing the temporary nonuse decision-making process, which shall be 
as informal as practicable, consistent with principles of fundamental 
fairness. The procedures shall afford the carrier an opportunity to 
submit in person, in writing, or through a representative, information 
and argument in opposition to a temporary nonuse status.
    (2) If the carrier requests a review of the transportation officer's 
decision, the transportation officer shall afford the carrier an 
opportunity to make a presentation, orally or in writing, or through a 
representative, to a designated agency reviewing official. This 
presentation shall be held within 5 workdays of the transportation 
officer's receipt of the carrier's request for a review of his/her 
decision. The reviewing official shall:
    (i) Consider the carrier's submission, investigate the contentions 
made, and make written findings of fact concerning the matters in 
dispute;
    (ii) Assess mitigating factors and corrective measures proposed by 
the carrier;
    (iii) Determine whether the facts, as found during his/her review, 
support a cause for imposition of the period of temporary nonuse 
proposed by the transportation officer; and
    (iv) Inform the carrier of the result of his/her review within 5 
workdays of receiving the carrier's submission or presentation.
    (3) The effective date of the period of temporary nonuse may be 
delayed if there is a review by a designated agency reviewing official. 
Should a period of temporary nonuse be imposed following such a review, 
the period of temporary nonuse shall be adjusted to reflect the period 
proposed by the transportation officer unless a different period is 
recommended by the reviewing official.
    (d) Decision to impose temporary nonuse. In actions in which a 
carrier does not request a review of the transportation officer's 
decision, the transportation officer shall make a decision on the basis 
of all the information contained in the administrative record, including 
any submission by the carrier. The Transportation officer shall inform 
the carrier of his/her decision within 5 workdays of the closing of the 
period for evaluating the carrier's information and arguments or his/her 
receipt of the reviewing officer's report. This decision shall be 
communicated in writing, by return receipt mail, and shall include 
notice of:
    (1) The extent or scope of the period of nonuse including the 
specific transportation facilities affected by the period of temporary 
nonuse;
    (2) The effective dates of the period of temporary nonuse;

[[Page 441]]

    (3) The corrective action, if any, necessary to be removed from 
temporary nonuse status;
    (4) An additional period of 30 calendar days for debarment referral 
if the conduct leading to the imposition of the period of temporary 
nonuse continues; and
    (5) Procedures for the carrier to obtain a review of the 
transportation officer's decision by a designated reviewing official.

<R05>
Sec. 101-40.408-4  Period of temporary nonuse.

    Temporary nonuse shall be for a period commensurate with the 
seriousness of the cause(s) for temporary nonuse, but not for more than 
90 consecutive days, except that the period of temporary nonuse may be 
extended an additional 30 calendar days for debarment referral when the 
carrier fails to correct the cause(s) for which temporary nonuse was 
imposed. The transportation officer, for good cause, may impose 
temporary nonuse beginning the same day that the notice of proposed 
temporary nonuse is given when continued use of the carrier's services 
would place the Government at risk. The transportation officer may 
consider terminating the temporary nonuse or reducing the period of 
temporary nonuse, upon the carrier's application, supported by 
documentation, for reasons deemed appropriate by the transportation 
officer, such as:
    (a) Newly discovered material evidence;
    (b) Bona fide change in the carrier's ownership or management; or
    (c) Elimination of the cause(s) for which temporary nonuse was 
imposed.

    (a) The debarring official may, in the best interest of the 
Government, debar a carrier for any of the causes contained in Sec. 101-
40.409-2, using the procedures provided in 48 CFR 9.406-3. The existence 
of a cause for debarment under Sec. 101-40.409-2 does not necessarily 
require that a carrier be debarred; the seriousness of the carrier's 
acts or omissions and the mitigating factors should be considered in 
making any debarment decision.
    (b) Debarment of a carrier constitutes debarment of all divisions or 
other organizational elements of the carrier, unless the debarment 
decision is limited by its terms to specific divisions or organizational 
elements. The debarring official may extend the debarment decision to 
include any affiliates of the carrier, if the affiliates are--
    (1) Specifically named and
    (2) Given written notice of the proposed debarment and an 
opportunity to respond.
    (c) A carrier's debarment shall apply to all agencies including the 
Department of Defense unless the head of the agency requiring 
transportation services, or an authorized representative, states in 
writing the compelling reasons justifying continued business dealings 
between that agency and the carrier.

nonuse, to correct any of the causes listed in Sec. 101-40.408-2;
    (b) Conviction of or civil judgment for:
    (1) Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with 
obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a contract for 
transportation;
    (2) Violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes;
    (3) Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, 
falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, or 
receiving stolen property; or
    (4) Commission of any other offense indicating a lack of business 
integrity or business honesty which seriously and directly affects the 
present responsibility of the carrier as a transporter of the 
Government's property or the

[[Page 442]]

household goods of its employees relocated in the interest of the 
Government.
    (c) Violation of the terms of a contract for transportation so 
serious as to justify debarment, such as:
    (1) Willful failure to perform in accordance with the terms of one 
or more contracts for transportation, or
    (2) A history of failure to perform, or of unsatisfactory 
performance of, one or more contracts for transportation;
    (d) Any other cause of so serious or compelling a nature that it 
affects the present responsibility of the carrier; or
    (e) Debarment for any of the causes stated in paragraphs (a) through 
(d) of this section by another agency where the orignal debarment did 
not have Governmentwide effect.

Sec. 101-40.410-1  General.

    (a) The suspending official may, in the Government's best interest, 
suspend a carrier for any of the causes stated in Sec. 101-40.410-2, 
using the procedures provided in 48 CFR 9.407-3.
    (b) Suspension is a serious action to be imposed on the basis of 
adequate evidence of one or more of the causes set forth in Sec. 101-
40.410-2, pending the completion of investigation or legal proceedings, 
when it has been determined that immediate action is necessary to 
protect the Government's interest. In assessing the adequacy of the 
evidence, consideration should be given to how much information is 
available, how credible it is given the circumstances, whether or not 
important allegations are corroborated, and what inferences can 
reasonably be drawn as a result. This assessment should include an 
examination of basic documents such as contracts of carriage, loss or 
damage reports, and correspondence, as appropriate.
    (c) Suspension of a carrier constitutes suspension of all divisions 
or other organizational elements of the carrier, unless the suspension 
decision is limited by its terms to specific divisions or organizational 
elements. The suspending official may extend the suspension decision to 
include any affiliates of the carrier, if they are--
    (1) Specifically named and
    (2) Given written notice of the suspension and an opportunity to 
respond.
    (d) A carrier's suspension shall apply to all agencies, including 
the Department of Defense, unless the head of an agency requiring 
transportation services, or an authorized representative, states in 
writing the compelling reasons justifying continued business dealings 
between that agency and the carrier.

integrity or business honesty that seriously and directly affects the 
present responsibility of the carrier as a transporter of the 
Government's property or the household goods of its employees relocated 
in the interest of the Government.
    (b) Indictment for any of the causes in paragaph (a) of this section 
constitutes adequate evidence for suspension;
    (c) The suspending official, may upon adequate evidence also suspend 
a carrier for any other cause of so serious or compelling a nature that 
it affects the present responsiblity of a carrier; or
    (d) A carrier may be suspended for any of the above causes based on 
a suspension by another agency where the original suspension does not 
have Governmentwide effect.

between the quantity or condition of property in shipments received from 
commercial carriers and the quantity or condition of that property as 
shown on the covering bill of lading or other transportation document.

<R05>
Sec. 101-40.701  Receipt of shipment from carrier.

    When accepting delivery of a shipment from the carrier, a careful 
inspection and check shall be made of the quantity and condition of the 
property received, and an accurate record shall be made and kept of any 
discrepancies or variations between the data shown on the covering bill 
of lading or other transportation document and the quantity and 
condition of property actually received. When an overage, shortage, 
loss, damage, or other discrepancy is noted upon receipt of shipment, a 
discrepancy report shall be prepared as required in Sec. 101-40.702-3. A 
damaged shipment shall not be rejected regardless of the degree of 
damage or the contract delivery terms, except as indicated in Sec. 101-
40.704-1(c). The consignee shall take reasonable precautions to protect 
the damaged property in order to mitigate the losses to the carrier. 
Care shall be taken to preserve the contents, the original package, and 
the packing material pending completion of inspection by the carrier. 
Where applicable, the following actions shall be taken in checking and 
documenting delivery conditions:
    (a) When a shipment is received in a closed conveyance, a notation 
shall be made on the carrier's delivery receipt or freight bill and on 
the consignee's copy of the delivery receipt or freight bill of the 
number and condition of any seals; i.e., intact, broken, or missing, on 
the carrier's conveyance and whether the shipment was properly loaded, 
stowed, blocked, and braced.
    (b) On shipments other than in bulk, the number of pieces or 
packages in the shipment shall be physically counted and recorded by 
means of a stroke tally or other appropriate method.
    (c) A notation shall be made on the carrier's delivery receipt, if 
available, and the consignee's copy of the delivery receipt or freight 
bill of the condition of the railcar, motor vehicle, container, or other 
conveyance with particular attention to any circumstance that might 
contribute to loss or damage; e.g., loose flooring or sides or 
protruding nails or bolts. When there is suspicion or evidence of damage 
to an ocean shipment, the ocean carrier or his agent shall be requested 
to furnish details concerning the manner of stowage of the shipment 
aboard the vessel.
    (d) If a shipment is received in apparent bad order; e.g., if the 
load is shifted or jumbled or containers are broken or leaking, 
photographs of the damaged freight and/or of conditions of loading which 
might have contributed to the damage shall be made, whenever possible, 
for use as documentary evidence in the event of a claim. Each photograph 
shall be marked indelibly with the Government or commercial bill of 
lading number, the ocean or international air bill of lading number and/
or the carrier's delivery receipt number, the vehicle identification 
number or vessel's name, and the date the photograph was taken. 
Photographs of damaged shipments delivered by ocean carriers shall be 
made at the ocean carrier's terminal prior to accepting the shipment.

<R05>
Sec. 101-40.702-1  Exception on carrier's delivery receipt.

    (a) Before signing the carrier's delivery receipt, the Government 
consignee (or representative) shall note on the receipt specific details 
regarding the nature and extent of all apparent overages, shortages, 
losses, damages, or other discrepancies between the quantity and 
condition of the property as received and as shown on the covering bill 
of lading or other transportation document. Any notation placed on the 
carrier's delivery receipt shall also be shown on the consignee's copy 
of the delivery receipt or freight bill. The consignee shall sign and 
date these notations and request the carrier's driver or representative 
also to sign the notations.
    (b) In the instance of an ocean shipment, placing an exception on 
the carrier's delivery receipt is not necessary if the condition of the 
shipment has been the subject of a joint survey or inspection; that is, 
if representatives of the carrier and the consignee jointly surveyed or 
inspected the shipment while it was still in the possession of the 
carrier, and a copy of the joint report signed by both representatives 
is in the possession of the consignee (46 U.S.C. 1303 (6)).

Bill of Lading, or on a Standard Form 1203, U.S. Government Bill of 
Lading-Privately Owned Personal Property, the consignee shall make 
certain the Government bill of lading number is shown on both the 
carrier's delivery receipt and the consignee's copy of the delivery 
receipt. When a shipment is made on a commercial bill of lading to be 
converted to a Government bill of lading, in which case the Government 
bill of lading number would not normally be known at the time of 
delivery, the consignee shall sign the delivery receipt and enter the 
Government bill of lading number, when it becomes available, on the 
consignee's copy of the delivery receipt.
    (b) When a discrepancy occurs in a shipment made on a Government 
bill of lading, appropriate notations shall be made on the delivery 
receipt as required in Sec. 101-40.702-1 and a discrepancy report shall 
be prepared as required in Sec. 101-40.702-3.
    (c) The agency responsible for payment of freight charges, as 
identified in the ``Charges to be billed to'' space on the Government 
bill of lading, is usually also responsible for determining carrier 
liability (see Sec. 101-40.707-2) and processing claims (see Sec. 101-
40.710). The consignee shall forward a discrepancy report and copies of 
supporting documents; e.g., delivery receipts, photographs, and 
carrier's inspection reports, to that agency, to the shipper at the 
address shown on the Government bill of lading, and to any other 
addresses as may be required by the agency's regulations. In addition, 
copies of discrepancy reports and supporting documents relating to 
special categories of property shall be forwarded to appropriate offices 
as required in Sec. 101-40.702-3 (c), (d), and (e).

    (a) When the total value of the loss, damage, shortage, or other 
discrepancy, or the value of repairs or replacement, including unearned 
freight charges, where applicable, on a single bill of lading or other 
transportation document, does not exceed $50, Government agencies are 
authorized, but not required, to observe a minimum of $50 or less in 
processing loss and damage claims against carriers or forwarders and to 
absorb losses of $50 or less.
    (b) When the total value of the loss, damage, shortage, or other 
discrepancy, or the value of repairs or replacement, including unearned 
freight charges, where applicable, on a single bill of lading or other 
transportation document exceeds $50 or the minimum (i.e., $50 or less) 
set by the agency, the receiving activity shall prepare Standard Form 
361, Transportation Discrepancy Report, as soon as possible, but not 
later than 45 calendar days after

[[Page 445]]

receipt of the shipment or discovery of the discrepancy. Every effort 
shall be made to reconcile overages or shortages within 15 calendar days

narcotics, hazardous articles, or sensitive materials, regardless of 
dollar value, shall be reported to the appropriate agencies within 24 
hours in accordance with paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section.) 
Any photographs taken as documentary evidence (see Sec. 101-40. 701(d)) 
should be attached to the discrepancy report to support claim action.

Sec. 101-40.703  Notification of carrier.


<R05>
Sec. 101-40.703-1  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 101-40.703-2  Notice of visible loss, damage, or shortage.

    (a) Usually, it is sufficient to notify the last line-haul or 
delivering carrier (not a drayage or switching carrier) of a shipment 
discrepancy by annotating the carrier's delivery receipt. This notation 
shall be entered on the consignee's copy of the delivery receipt. When 
the carrier's delivery receipt is not available at the time of delivery 
of the shipment, notification shall be made within 24 hours by telephone 
to the nearest office of the delivering carrier to provide the carrier 
an opportunity, if desired, to verify the loss, damage, or shortage. 
Except as provided in Sec. 101-40.702-3(a), in every instance of damage 
or shortage, the agency shall notify the carrier on SF 361 within 7 
calendar days of receipt of the shipment and invite the carrier to 
perform an inspection, except in those instances where it is known that 
the total amount of damage or shortage, or the value of repairs or 
replacement, including unearned freight charges, on a single bill of 
lading or other transportation document, does not exceed $50. If the 
carrier waives the opportunity to perform an inspection, the responsible 
Government employee receiving the shipment shall make a written record 
of the waiver, including the date the request for inspection was made 
and the name of the carrier representative

[[Page 446]]

who was contacted and waived inspection. In the instance of an 
international shipment by an ocean or air carrier, SF 361 shall be 
furnished the carrier before the property is removed from the carrier's 
possession, except as provided in Sec. 101-40.702-1(b).
    (b) If the damaged property is of a perishable nature or is in such 
a condition as to be potentially injurious to life, health, or property, 
prompt notification to the carrier shall be made by telephone and 
confirmed in writing. If the carrier fails to perform a timely 
inspection and to participate in the disposition proceedings, necessary 
steps shall be taken to dispose of the property in a manner which will 
mitigate the loss to the carrier and avoid injury to other property or 
persons.
    (c) In the instance of a domestic shipment, if the lost or damaged 
shipment involves nonperishable material, the property shall be held for 
a reasonable time (usually 5 workdays after notification) to allow the 
carrier time to complete inspection.
    (d) When an entire shipment is lost, the consignee shall notify the 
origin carrier by telephone and use SF 361 to confirm the notification.

<R05>
Sec. 101-40.703-3  Notice of concealed loss, damage, or shortage.

    (a) Domestic shipments. When loss, damage, or shortage that was not 
apparent at the time of delivery is subsequently discovered, and the 
total amount of loss, damage, or shortage, including unearned freight 
charges, where applicable, on a single bill of lading or other 
transportation document, is known to exceed $50 or the amount ($50 or 
less) set by the agency pursuant to Sec. 101-40.702.3(a), the delivering 
carrier (not a drayage or switching carrier) shall be notified by 
telephone and requested to inspect the property involved. Unless there 
are extenuating circumstances, the notification and request for 
inspection shall be made by telephone not later than 15 calendar days 
from the date of receipt of the shipment and confirmed on SF 361. SF 361 
shall include the date the telephone request for inspection was made and 
the name of the carrier's representative who was contacted. A copy of 
the notification and request for inspection shall be retained for 
possible claim purposes. Wrappings, packing materials, and any unopened 
packages shall be retained for the carrier's inspection. A copy of the 
carrier's inspection report shall be requested for use in determining 
liability or preparing a claim. If the carrier fails to make an 
inspection within a reasonable time as stated in Sec. 101-40.703-2(c), 
or if the carrier waives the opportunity to perform an inspection, the 
carrier shall furnish an oral or written waiver as provided in SF 361.
    (b) International shipments. When loss, damage, or shortage that was 
not apparent at the time of removal of the property from the carrier's 
possession is subsequently discovered when the packages are opened, the 
carrier shall be notified promptly in writing using SF 361. When an 
ocean carrier is involved, the written complaint shall be given to the 
carrier or its agency at the port of discharge within 3 calendar days of 
delivery (46 U.S.C. 1303(6)). When an international air carrier is 
involved, a written complaint to the carrier shall be given within 14 
calendar days of receipt of the property (Article 26 of the Warsaw 
Convention, 49 Stat. 3020, as interpreted and applied by the Civil 
Aeronautics Board in its Order 78-8-10 of August 3, 1978). Written 
notice to ocean and international air carriers shall indicate a 
reasonable period of time for inspecting concealed loss or damage.

Sec. 101-40.704  Disposition of damaged property.


<R05>
Sec. 101-40.704-1  Transportation for account of the Government.

    (a) Repair and utilization. Where damaged property can be repaired 
economically and satisfactorily, arrangements shall be made by the 
Government agency paying the transportation charges, or its authorized 
representative, to have the repairs effected and to claim against the 
carrier for the costs thereof. Alternatively, the carrier may be allowed 
to perform the repairs or make

[[Page 447]]

the necessary arrangements therefor, subject to inspection and 
acceptance by Government agency inspectors or other designated 
representatives. However, in no case shall property subject to security 
regulations be released to the carrier or to any unauthorized personnel 
for repair.
    (b) Allowance for damage. When the agency finds it not desirable or 
feasible to make repairs immediately, and the carrier does not make 
repairs, the amount of damage or the cost of making repairs in the 
future may be determined by appropriate means (e.g., by mutual agreement 
of representatives of the carrier and the Government or by estimates 
obtained from qualified and disinterested parties).
    (c) Rejection. (1) Property may be rejected to the carrier and claim 
made for its full value only when it has been damaged to the extent that 
it has no salvage value or it is not economically repairable; that is, 
the cost of repairs would exceed the appraised value of the repaired 
item (see exception in paragraph (c)(3) of this section).
    (2) When it is determined that property has been damaged to the 
extent that it has no salvage value or is not economically repairable, 
and that it can be abandoned, the carrier shall be notified promptly of 
the location of the rejected property and shall be requested to make 
appropriate disposition of it.
    (i) If the carrier refuses to accept the rejected property, the 
agency shall request, in writing, that the carrier furnish a written 
statement of the reason for refusing the property. Upon receipt of the 
written refusal, the agency shall take appropriate action to dispose of 
the rejected property; or
    (ii) If the carrier fails to make appropriate disposition of the 
rejected property within a reasonable length of time, the agency shall 
notify the carrier, in writing, that the property will be disposed of by 
the agency without further delay.
    (3) Property which is designated Top Secret, Secret, or 
Confidential, or property which, for any reason, cannot be abandoned in 
the best interests of the Government, shall not be rejected to the 
carrier, regardless of the extent of damage.

<R05>
Sec. 101-40.704-2  Transportation for account of the supplier.

    When the transportation is performed by the carrier for the supplier 
rather than for the Government (e.g., when property is purchased f.o.b. 
destination), accurate notations of discrepancies shall be made on the 
carrier's delivery receipt and the consignee's copy of the carrier's 
delivery receipt or freight bill to assist the supplier in filing claims 
for transportation losses. The carrier's driver or representative shall 
be requested to sign the notations of discrepancies. Prompt notification 
on SF 361 shall be furnished to the supplier or to the agency 
contracting officer as individual agency regulations may provide. The 
notification shall include supporting documents; i.e., a copy of the 
annotated delivery receipt, photos, carrier's inspection report, or 
written waiver. (See Discrepancies or Deficiencies in GSA or DOD 
Shipments, Material, or Billings (FPMR 101-26.8) with regard to damage 
to stock or nonstock items procured from GSA for direct delivery.)

Sec. 101-40.705  Disposition of overages and astray or misconsigned shipments.

    (a) When the number of packages offered for delivery is more than 
that shown on the applicable bill of lading or other transportation 
document and when all packages are marked for the consignee, the 
overages shall be accepted. The consignee shall attempt to reconcile 
overages and astray freight with corresponding shortages associated with 
other shipments received at that activity.
    (b) If excess freight on one bill of lading is identical with a 
reported shortage on another bill of lading, the excess or overage shall 
be used to offset the reported shortage. If excess freight cannot be 
identified or used to offset other shortages within 7 calendar days

[[Page 448]]

after the date of discovery, the consignee shall use SF 361 to request 
disposition instructions from the consignor or shipper and shall convey 
these instructions to the delivering carrier.
    (c) If a carrier attempts to deliver a shipment containing packages 
which are marked for another consignee or which cannot otherwise be 
identified, the misdirected or astray packages shall not be accepted.

Sec. 101-40.707  Determining liability for discrepancies.


<R05>
Sec. 101-40.707-1  Transportation for account of the supplier.

    When the transportation is performed by the carrier for the supplier 
rather than for the Government (e.g., when the property is purchased 
f.o.b. destination), determination of liability for discrepancies in 
shipment will be resolved between the carrier and the supplier. However, 
in such instances the Government receiving activity shall make accurate 
notations of discrepancies on the carrier's delivery receipt or freight 
bill, and shall use SF 361 to furnish a report of the discrepancies to 
the supplier, or to the agency contracting officer as individual agency 
regulations may provide, to assist the supplier in resolving the 
discrepancies. The report shall include supporting documents; i.e., a 
copy of the annotated delivery receipt, photos, inspection report, or 
written waiver.
[51 FR 24342, July 3, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 101-40.707-2  Transportation for account of the Government.

    Determination of liability for discrepancies shall be the 
responsibility of the Government agency paying the transportation 
charges (a) in all instances where a shipment is made on a Government 
bill of lading, commercial bill of lading to be converted to a 
Government bill of lading, commercial bill of lading bearing a notation 
that charges will be borne by the U.S. Government, commercial bill of 
lading under commercial forms and procedures for small shipments (see 
Sec. 101-41.304-2), or purchase order for local drayage, and (b) in 
other instances where the Government assumes the risk for loss and 
damage at origin; e.g., when property is purchased f.o.b. origin, 
freight prepaid. While no precise formula can be prescribed for agencies 
to follow in determining whether liability for loss and damage rests 
with the carrier, the shipper, or a third party, an analysis shall be 
made of all the pertinent factors and circumstances involved, including, 
when appropriate, consideration of the following:
    (1) Type and adequacy of the packing and packaging.
    (2) Adequacy of marking, including precautionary markings for 
fragile or dangerous cargo.
    (3) Condition of the package, including any indications of rough 
handling or pilferage.
    (4) In case of load lots:
    (i) Condition of the vehicle, whether dirty, contaminated, unsafe, 
structurally defective, appropriate type, etc.;
    (ii) Identification and condition of seals on conveyances and by 
whom applied;
    (iii) Manner of loading, stowing, blocking, and bracing; and
    (iv) Determination as to whether loading was performed by shipper or 
carrier.
    (5) Tally records and how compiled.
    (6) Photographic evidence.
    (7) Expert or professional appraisals.

Sec. 101-40.708  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 101-40.709  Time limitations for filing claims.

    Government agencies shall take prompt action to recover amounts due 
the United States as a result of discrepancies in delivery, in 
accordance with time limitations established by the bill of lading or 
other contracts of carriage, or by statute. The following are examples 
of such time limitations:
    (a) Domestic shipments. (1) Claims for loss or damage to shipments 
transported by carriers subject to the Revised Interstate Commerce Act 
(49

[[Page 449]]

U.S.C. 10101, et seq., Pub. L. 95-473, October 17, 1978, as amended) 
shall be filed within the specified limits required by law, the terms of 
the bill of lading or other contract of carriage, and all tariff 
provisions applicable thereto. Pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 11707(e), bills of 
lading normally issued by rail and motor carriers specify that written 
claim be made upon the carrier within 9 months after delivery of 
property damaged or within 9 months following the time when delivery of 
property should have been made, and that suit shall be instituted within 
2 years from the date the carrier or its agent notifies the claimant in 
writing that the specified claim is disallowed in whole or in part. 
Neither limitation is applicable to shipments made on Government bills 
of lading, or commercial bills of lading to be converted to Government 
bills of lading, or commercial bills of lading subject to the terms of 
the Government bill of lading. (See Sec. 101-41.302-3(g) for exemption 
authority.)
    (2) Claims for loss or damage to shipments moving by domestic air 
carriers shall be filed within the limits prescribed on individual 
carrier's air waybills.
    (b) Ocean shipments. The Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (46 U.S.C. 
1303(6), as amended) imposes a 1-year limitation for bringing court 
action against ocean carriers for loss or damage.
    (c) International air shipments. Complaints of loss or damage shall 
be submitted in writing to the international air carrier within the 
following time limits set by Article 26 of the Warsaw Convention (49 
Stat. 3020, as amended):
    (1) Claims for visible damage to goods must be filed as soon as 
possible following discovery of the damage but within 14 days from 
receipt of the goods;
    (2) Claims for other damage to goods must be filed within 14 days 
from the receipt of goods;
    (3) Claims for nondelivery of goods must be filed within 120 days 
from the date of the issue of the air waybill; and
    (4) A 2-year limitation is imposed by Article 29 of the Warsaw 
Convention (49 Stat. 3021) for bringing court action against the carrier 
for loss or damage to international air shipments.
    (d) International air shipments. A 2-year limitation is imposed by 
Article 29 of the Warsaw Convention (49 Stat. 3000) for bringing court 
actions against air carriers for loss or damage to international air 
shipments.

Sec. 101-40.710  Processing claims against carriers.

    (a) When the transportation is for the account of the Government 
(see Sec. 101-40.707-2) and when it is determined that the carrier is 
responsible for loss or damage to a shipment (other than household 
goods), a claim shall be prepared on Standard Form 362, U.S. Government 
Freight Loss/Damage Claim, and forwarded in duplicate to the appropriate 
carrier with the necessary supporting documents; e.g., delivery 
receipts, photographs, inspection reports, except as otherwise provided 
in Sec. 101-40.711. (See 49 CFR parts 1005 and 1056 for additional 
regulations concerning processing of claims against carriers subject to 
the Revised Interstate Commerce Act.) Standard Form 362 (see Sec. 101-
40.4901) is approved by the Office of Management and Budget under OMB 
control number 3090-0113.
    (b) Claims for loss and damage to household goods shipments moving 
on a GBL shall be prepared on claim forms furnished by the carriers.
    (c) The appropriate carrier against which the claim shall be filed 
is--
    (1) Usually the destination line-haul carrier (not the drayage 
company or switching carrier performing the delivery service for the 
destination line-haul carrier) in instances of domestic freight 
shipments made on Standard Form 1103 or a commercial bill of lading 
converted to a Government bill of lading or subject to the terms and 
conditions of the Government bill of lading;
    (2) The household goods carrier specified on Standard Form 1203; or
    (3) Usually the origin carrier on ocean or international air 
shipments.

When it is conclusively known on which carrier's line the loss or damage 
occurred, the claim may be filed against that carrier. When no part of 
the shipment has been delivered, the claim would normally be filed 
against

[[Page 450]]

the carrier which accepted the shipment.

<R05>
Sec. 101-40.711-1  Claims against domestic carriers.

    Formal claims (Standard Form 362 with supporting documents) shall be 
filed with domestic carriers within the time limits noted in Sec. 101-
40.709.
    (a) Rail carriers, motor carriers, inland water carriers, domestic 
forwarders, and other carriers subject to the Interstate Commerce Act 
(ICA), are required under 49 CFR subpart 1005.3 to acknowledge receipt 
of a formal claim in writing to the claimant within 30 days after 
receipt. In addition, 49 CFR subpart 1005.5 requires carriers which 
receive a written claim for loss or damage to property transported to 
pay, decline, or make a firm compromise settlement in writing to the 
claimant within 120 days after receipt of the claim by the carriers. If 
the claim cannot be processed or disposed of within the initial 120 
days, the carriers at that time and at the end of each succeeding 60-day 
period, while the claim remains pending, shall advise the claimant in 
writing of the status of the claim and the reason for the delay in 
making final disposition thereof.
    (b) When any carrier fails to dispose of a loss or damage claim 
within a reasonable period of time, agencies shall collect the claim by 
setoff action; i.e., withholding payments from amounts otherwise due and 
payable to the carrier for transportation and related services. Earlier 
collection by setoff may be made if it is known that a carrier is 
involved in a bankruptcy, insolvency, or relocation proceeding, and it 
is clearly in the Government's interest to do so (4 CFR parts 102 
through 105).

Sec. 101-40.711-2  Claims against ocean and international air carriers.

    Regulations of the General Accounting Office (chapter 13, Sec. 86.1, 
GAO Policy and Procedures Manual for Guidance of Federal Agencies) 
require that:
    (a) When a loss or damage for which the carrier is administratively 
determined to be liable has occurred in an ocean or international air 
shipment, effort should be made to withhold an amount sufficient to 
reimburse the Government for the loss or damage from the carrier's bill 
covering the charges for the transportation or related services on the 
same shipment. If this is not possible, the withholding should be made 
from a payment due the carrier on an unrelated account. Notice to the 
carrier of withholding should request the carrier's consent to such 
action.
    (b) If the carrier does not consent to the withholding action 
prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section, or if the claim is not 
otherwise compromised or withdrawn in accordance with 4 CFR part 103 or 
104, referral of the matter shall be made to the Department of Justice 
for consideration of the need for suit to reduce the Government's claim 
to judgment. The referral shall be made at least 90 calendar days prior 
to the expiration of the 1-year period for bringing suit against ocean 
carriers (46 U.S.C. 1303(6)) or the 2-year period for bringing suit 
against international air carriers (Article 29 of the Warsaw Convention; 
49 Stat. 3021).

    When it is determined as the result of investigation or evidence 
submitted by a carrier that loss or damage to a Government shipment is 
not the responsibility of the carrier, the consignee shall take 
necessary steps to clear the carrier of liability and to withdraw or

[[Page 451]]

amend any claim which may have been filed for recovery of losses. In 
this regard, the consignee shall prepare a document which will 
effectively remove or amend any exception that had been noted on the 
carrier's delivery documents. While no precise form or format is 
prescribed, this document shall be prepared in sufficient detail to 
identify the shipment and to show the basis for relieving the carrier of 
liability. This includes
    (a) A reference to the Government bill of lading number or other 
transportation document;
    (b) A detailed description of the property shipped;
    (c) A reference to the exception taken to the quantity or condition 
of the property delivered;
    (d) The number and date of any claim which has been filed with the 
carrier; and
    (e) The basis on which the exception or claim is being withdrawn.

The consignee shall forward the original of this document to the carrier 
against whom the claim has been filed (or, in case the claim has not yet 
been filed, to the carrier that is billing for transportation charges or 
related services), and a copy shall be attached to the blue memorandum 
copy (Memorandum Copy-Consignee) of the bill of lading. In addition, the 
consignee shall send copies of the document to other offices involved in 
the initial claim action. (See the GSA handbook, Discrepancies or 
Deficiencies in GSA or DOD Shipments, Material, or Billings (subpart

Sec. 101-41.102  GSA responsibilities and functions.

    (a) With respect to the audit of transportation payments and under

overcharges;
    (5) Prepare reports to the Attorney General of the United States 
setting forth recommendations regarding the legal and technical bases 
available for use in prosecuting or defending suits by or against the 
United States and provide technical, fiscal, and factual data from 
records relative thereto;
    (6) Provide transportation specialists and lawyers to serve as 
expert witnesses, to assist in pretrial conferences, to draft pleadings,

direct to the

[[Page 462]]

General Accounting Office (GAO) matters for consideration by the 
Comptroller General of the United States or by a division of the GAO or 
shall forward direct to the Department of Justice matters for its 
consideration of collection action, litigation, and related proceedings, 
as prescribed in 4 CFR part 105. A claimant who disagrees with the 
settlement of his claim by GSA's audit surrogate may request 
reconsideration by the agency head or review by the Comptroller General 
of the United States in accordance with the guidelines set forth in 
subpart 101-41.7. These matters need not be forwarded through GSA.
    (c) GSA also makes technical examinations of payments to and claims 
by or against carriers for transportation services procured on 
commercial or Government documentation by certain Government agencies 
and corporations exempted from submitting transportation payment 
documents for centralized audit.
    (d) GSA, independently or in cooperation with other agencies, will 
confer with individual carriers or carrier groups and associations

concerning technical and accounting matters and to acquaint them with 
the requirements of the Federal Government.
    (e) Carrier accounting and traffic officials are welcome to visit 
the GSA transportation audit facilities to discuss transportation audit 
matters. These facilities are located in the GS Building, 18th and F

<R05>
Sec. 101-41.103  Procedures, conditions, and limitations relevant to the delegation of authority to perform prepayment audits of selected transportation bills.

    (a) Except for the authority exercised by GSA in Sec. 101-41.103(i), 
requests for a delegation of authority from the Administrator of General 
Services to conduct prepayment audits shall be accompanied by a specific 
and complete description of the organization to perform the audit and 
the manner whereby the audit will be conducted. Such requests shall 
demonstrate cost-effectiveness or other public benefits.
    (b) Prepayment audits by GSA's Office of Transportation Audits on 
behalf of itself and/or other agencies, need not be approved by the 
Administrator because the authority to conduct prepayment audits is 
already provided by law.
    (c) Each request shall include a detailed model of the audit process 
from receipt of carrier bills to disbursement and the subsequent 
submission of paid vouchers to GSA for postpayment audit.
    (d) The requester shall demonstrate the capability not only to 
complete an accurate audit within 15 calendar days of receipt of a 
carrier's bill, but also evidence the ability to generate an accurate 
notice to the carrier which specifically describes the reason for any 
full or partial rejection of the carrier's charges, citing the rate 
authority applicable thereto.
    (e) The request shall contain a mechanism to report savings, on a 
semiannual basis and in a manner acceptable to GSA, accomplished by 
identifying overcharges/overbillings, or other savings indicating the 
program is cost-effective or otherwise in the public interest.
    (f) Public notice of delegated authorities will be effected by 
publication in the Federal Register notices section. Such notices will 
specify the Government department/agency whose bills are subject to such 
audit and the organization or command; i.e., the activity which will 
conduct such audits.
    (g) Authority delegated in accordance with this section is subject 
to

[[Page 463]]

complete oversight by GSA. This oversight and a test of accuracy will be 
made through the postpayment audit process and through onsite 
inspection. To assist in this process, prepayment audit activities (and/
or their contractors) are required to stamp each bill so audited with a 
certification substantially as follows:

    I certify that this bill was audited and certified for payment in 
the amount of $____.


The stamp will also indicate both the name of the audit activity and the 
name of any contractor involved, and be initialed and dated by the 
auditor. Paid bills that were subject to prepayment audit must be 
forwarded to GSA, Attn: FWA (Code PA), under separate cover.
    (h) Except as provided in Sec. 101-41.604-2, when a prepayment audit 
results in a reduction to a properly presented invoice, interest 
penalties will be paid if required by the Prompt Payment Act. The 
designee must approve for payment the amount claimed by the carrier, 
reduced only by the amount disputed on prepayment audit, or otherwise 
allowed to be withheld by law or regulation.
    (i) Unpaid bills. (1) Notwithstanding any other provision herein, 
GSA may request that agencies forward unpaid transportation bills 
approved for payment after prepayment audit by a designee agency (if 
any), in lieu of payment to the carrier/forwarder, in order to 
adequately protect the Government's right to setoff or where the best 
interests of the Government so require.
    (2) These unpaid bills shall be audited only to the extent necessary 
to prevent excess billings and to adequately protect the Government's 
right to setoff for identified and projected overpayments, and for known 
debts owed to other agencies.
    (3) Consistent with the purpose of paragraphs (i) (1) and (2) of 
this section, GSA may conduct a prepayment audit of carrier bills in the 
following circumstances:
    (i) The carrier/forwarder is involved in a proceeding under the 
Bankruptcy Code as a debtor or possible debtor, or is subject to the 
control of a receiver, trustee, or other similar representative;
    (ii) The carrier/forwarder consistently fails to refund overcharges 
without assertion of substantial defense or other valid reasons when 
notified by GSA or any other interested Government agency;
    (iii) The carrier/forwarder, without good cause, fails to make 
timely disposition or settlement of loss or damage or other claims 
asserted by agencies of the United States;
    (iv) The carrier/forwarder owes substantial sums of money to the 
United States for which no adequate arrangements for settlement have 
been made;
    (v) The carrier/forwarder, as a person or business entity, was 
determined administratively for valid reasons to be ineligible for 
payment, unless after review of the facts and in the absence of 
objection by the U.S. General Accounting Office, it is determined 
administratively that the best interests of the United States will not 
be jeopardized by such payment;
    (vi) The carrier/forwarder voluntarily withdraws or is otherwise 
involuntarily terminated from an agency-wide transportation program; or
    (vii) Any other circumstances where a reasonable person, in the 
exercise of ordinary prudence, would conclude that the carrier/forwarder 
is in such financial condition that is ability to pay debts owed to the 
Government is questionable.
    (4) Carriers/forwarders subject to prepayment audit by GSA for the 
reasons outlined in Sec. 101-41.103(i)(3), may offer substitute 
arrangements to adequately protect the Government's right to setoff in 
consideration for the avoidance of prepayment audit and/or a release of 
funds deemed adequate by the Government to pursue its right of setoff.
    (5) The exercise of actual setoff shall be conducted in accordance 
with the law.
    (j) All forms used by the designee or its audit activity in 
performing the prepayment audit must be approved by GSA (attn: FWC) 
prior to usage, and no rules or procedures relative to the prepayment 
audit may be published by them without GSA approval.
    (k) The designee and any audit activity under him/her is required to 
follow

[[Page 464]]

Comptroller General decisions and Federal Property Management 
Regulations, instructions, and precedents regarding substantive and 
procedural matters.
    (l) The designee may utilize contractors to accomplish the 
prepayment audit, but contractors are subject to all of the requirements 
that apply to the designee and his/her audit activity.
    (m) Except as provided for GSA in Sec. 101-41.103(i), prepayment 
audit authority exercised under this paragraph will not be directed to a 
particular carrier but may be directed toward specific types or 
categories of bills or exercised in some other nondiscriminatory manner.
    (n) GSA will exercise continuous oversight of the delegated 
prepayment audit authority. A delegation of authority to conduct a 
prepayment audit may be suspended in whole or in part by the Director, 
Office of Transportation Audits for failure to properly conduct 
prepayment audits. Such failures may include any of the following:
    (1) Failure to conduct an accurate audit (not less that 85 percent 
accuracy).
    (2) A pattern of failure to make timely payments, or failure to 
inform carriers within 15 days of defective invoices (Prompt Payment Act 
time limitations).
    (3) Audit not cost-effective, i.e., where the cost of the audit 
exceeds the benefits derived.
    (4) Failure to adjudicate carriers' claims disputing prepayment 
audit positions of the designee agency within 30 days of receipt.
    (5) Failure of the designee, or any audit authority under it to 
follow Comptroller General decisions, Federal Property Management 
Regulations, and instructions, or precedents regarding substantive and 
procedural matters.
    (6) Failure to provide information/data, or to cooperate in onsite 
inspections, necessary to analyze cost-effectiveness or to conduct a 
quality assurance review.

Sec. 101-41.202-4  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 101-41.202-5  Procurement of standard forms by agencies and carriers.

    (a) Agencies may obtain supplies of SF 1169 and SF 1170 assemblies 
from GSA by submitting a requisition in FEDSTRIP format to GSA's Federal 
Supply Service, Furniture Commodity Center (FCNI), Washington, DC 20406. 
With respect to the GTR assemblies, FCNI maintains a record of the 
serial numbers imprinted on the forms and the names and mailing 
addresses of the receiving agencies. Where feasible, agencies should 
request that the name and address of the office to be billed for payment 
of charges be preprinted on each SF 1169 and that the name and address 
of the office to receive the refund be preprinted on each SF 1170. No 
other overprinting on SF 1169, SF 1170, or SF 1170-EDP (computer-
generated) is permitted unless specifically approved in writing by the 
Director, Office of Transportation Audits (FW), GSA.
    (b) Carriers may purchase SF 1113 and SF 1113-A from the 
Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, 
Washington, DC 20402, or have them printed commercially. When printing 
these forms commercially, carriers shall ensure that the forms conform 
to the exact size, wording, and arrangement of the approved standard 
forms and, while no minimum grade of paper is set, carriers shall 
provide a reasonable grade of paperstock. Carriers may have SF 1113 and 
SF 1113-A printed also in continuous-feed format for machine billing by 
adding pin-feed strips on the margins. The tear-off slip may be moved 
from the bottom to the right edge of SF 1113, to aid in machine use of 
the form, but it must be perforated on all edges to measure 8\1/2\ by 
3\3/16\ inches when detached from the body of the SF 1113 and from the 
pin-feed strips. The forms must conform in all other respects to the 
exact size, wording, color, and arrangement of the approved standard 
forms. Any deviations must be approved in writing by the Director, 
Office of Transportation Audits (BW), GSA.

<R05>
Sec. 101-41.203-1  Procurement from carriers.

    (a) All passenger transportation services shall be procured with a 
GTR, Government contractor-issued charge card, or centrally billed 
account unless otherwise provided in Sec. 101-41.203-2 of this subpart. 
Agency heads or their designees may specify which of these Government-
provided methods of payment, or combination thereof, travelers will use 
to procure official passenger transportation services. Such services, 
regardless of the procurement method specified by the agency, must be 
procured directly from either a carrier or a travel agent. A travel 
agent may be used only as prescribed in the Federal Travel Regulation 
(FTR), 41 CFR chapters 301-304 or applicable regulations of the 
Department of Defense (DOD).
    (b) The use of U.S.-flag vessels for travel on official business and 
of U.S.-flag certificated air carriers for Government-financed passenger 
transportation is required by statute (46 U.S.C. 1241 and 49 U.S.C. 
1517) when such vessels and air carriers are available. Compliance with 
these statutes is mandatory whether the U.S. Government pays the 
transportation charges to the carrier direct or through reimbursement of 
an individual or other entity. Uniform standards and procedures 
prescribed by the Comptroller General of the United States for guidance 
of all departments, agencies, travelers, carriers, and others concerned 
in conforming to these statutes are found in 4 CFR 52.2 and in various 
Comptroller General decisions.

<R05>
Sec. 101-41.203-2  Use of cash.

    (a) A GTR or Government excess baggage authorization ticket (GEBAT) 
shall not be used to procure passenger transportation services costing 
$10 or less, exclusive of Federal transportation tax, and to pay air 
excess baggage charges of $15 or less for each leg of a trip (see 
Sec. 101-41.203-6), unless special circumstances justify their use. The 
contractor-issued charge card or centrally billed account shall be used 
for these purchases when practical. When not practical, use of cash may 
be authorized or approved. To procure passenger transportation services 
costing more than $10 but not more than $100, exclusive of Federal 
transportation tax, the GTR, Government contractor-issued charge card, 
or centrally billed account shall be used. Cash may be used for these 
purchases only when none of the other procurement methods is practical. 
For passenger transportation services costing more than $100, excluding 
Federal transportation tax, only a GTR, Government contractor-issued 
charge card, or centrally billed account may be used unless otherwise 
exempted in this subpart.
    (1) When the use of cash is authorized to purchase the services set 
forth in paragraph (a) of this section, cash payment may be made with a 
travel advance in accordance with provisions of the FTR (41 CFR 301-
10.3).
    (2) Any credit card, other than the Government contractor-issued 
charge card, and all travelers checks shall be considered the equivalent 
of cash and subject to the $100 limitation provided in paragraph (a) of 
this section.

(Note-- To protect the integrity of the Government charge card program 
designed for payment of allowable travel and transportation expenses 
incurred in connection with official travel, travelers shall be 
discouraged from using personal credit cards.)

    (3) Procurement of passenger transportation services under the group 
or charter provisions of the FTR (41 CFR 301-3.4(b)(2)) is not subject 
to the provisions of this subpart.
    (4) Authorization under paragraph (b) of this section to use cash in 
excess of $100 should be obtained prior to travel. In the absence of 
advance written authorization or approval, passenger transportation 
services exceeding $100 shall be purchased in accordance with policies 
and procedures prescribed in applicable Government travel regulations. 
It is a traveler's responsibility to know that use of a GTR, Government 
contractor-issued charge card, or centrally billed account may be 
required to obtain certain discount fares and to comply with the 
mandatory provisions of the FTR governing the use of contract airline 
service. Cash shall not be used to circumvent the regulations governing 
airline contracts.
    (b) Cash purchases of transportation services in excess of $100 
shall be discouraged and each agency shall establish procedures to 
encourage Federal travelers to use a Government contractor-issued charge 
card, centrally billed account, or GTR instead of cash to purchase 
passenger transportation services. Agencies shall monitor and control 
cash purchases of transportation services in a manner that will ensure 
such purchases are kept to a minimum.
    (1) When a Federal traveler does not use a GTR, Government 
contractor-issued charge card, or centrally billed account, heads of 
agencies, or their designated representatives, may in limited instances 
authorize travelers to exceed the $100 limitation when procuring 
passenger transportation services.
    (i) Each agency shall establish guidelines for approval of cash 
purchases in excess of $100 and determine if the use of cash is due to:
    (A) Emergency circumstances (where use of a GTR, Government 
contractor-issued charge card, or centrally billed account was not 
possible); or
    (B) Agency failure to advise a new employee and/or invited or 
infrequent traveler of proper procedures for purchasing transportation 
services.
    (ii) If a cash purchase is determined to have been made under a 
nonemergency circumstance, reimbursement shall not exceed the cost which 
would have been properly chargeable to the Government if the 
transportation services had been procured using one of the Government-
provided methods of procurement. Should a Federal employee make cash 
purchases without just cause or deliberately attempt to

[[Page 468]]

circumvent use of GSA air or rail service programs for personal 
convenience or some other reason not consistent with sound travel 
management practices, the agency may, as provided in 31 U.S.C. 3702, 
send all documents related to the travel to the Comptroller General, 
General Accounting Office, Claims Section, Washington, DC 20548, for a 
decision on the traveler's right to reimbursement.
    (2) Delegation of authority for authorizing and approving the use of 
cash in excess of $100 for the procurement of transportation services 
shall be held to as high an administrative level as practicable to 
ensure adequate consideration and review of the circumstances. Any such 
delegation shall be made in writing and copies shall be retained to 
permit monitoring of the system. The agency shall make delegation of 
authority records available for examination by GSA auditors.
    (3) To justify the use of cash in excess of $100 when procuring 
passenger transportation services, both the agency head, or the 
designated representative, and the traveler shall certify on the travel 
voucher the necessity for such use.
    (4) After a traveler has been reimbursed for a cash purchase, copies 
of travel authorizations, ticket coupons, and any ticket refund 
applications, or SF's 1170, Redemption of Unused Tickets, shall be 
forwarded for audit to the General Services Administration, 
Transportation Audit Division (FWA), Attention: Code E, Washington, DC 
20405.
    (5) The agency shall maintain travel vouchers and make them 
available for site audit by GSA auditors. General Records Schedule 9, 
Travel and Transportation Records (see 36 CFR 1228.22), provides 
instructions for the disposal of travel vouchers.
    (c) GSA (FWA) will report to the appropriate military or civilian 
agency travel manager for appropriate action suspected travel management 
errors and/or misroutings which result in higher travel costs to the 
Government.
    (d) A traveler who uses cash to purchase individual passenger 
transportation services shall procure such services directly from the 
carrier or from a travel agent under GSA or DOD contract (see Sec. 101-
41.203-1), and shall account for those expenses on their travel 
vouchers, furnishing passenger coupons or other evidence as appropriate 
in support thereof. Moreover, travelers shall assign to the Government 
the right to recover any excess payments involving carriers' use of 
improper rates. That assignment must be preprinted or otherwise 
annotated on the travel voucher and shall be initialed by the traveler.
    (e) Travelers using cash to procure passenger transportation 
services shall be made aware by their employing agencies of the 
provisions of Sec. 101-41.209-4 concerning a carrier's liability for 
liquidated damages because of failure to provide confirmed reserved 
space. Also, travelers using cash shall adhere to the regulations of the 
General Accounting Office (4 CFR 52.2) regarding the use of U.S.-flag 
vessels and air carriers (see Sec. 101-41.203-1(b)).

Sec. 101-41.203-3  Quantity (bulk) ticket purchases.

    Quantities of transportation tickets for use by persons traveling 
for the account of the United States may be procured through the 
issuance of a single GTR. Tickets and/or tokens for intracity 
transportation involving the use of local or short-haul transit service 
may be similarly purchased in bulk quantities. Each GTR issued for the 
procurement of tickets or tokens shall be identified as ``Bulk 
purchase,'' and tickets so procured shall bear the words ``U.S. 
Government'' and ``Not Redeemable for Cash Except by the U.S. 
Government.''
    (a) Discretionary authority to approve use of quantity purchase 
procedures. The head of an agency or his designee may approve the 
issuance of one GTR instead of individual GTR's or purchase orders to 
procure a quantity of tickets or tokens.
    (b) Limitations on and conditions for making quantity purchases. The 
discretionary authority to use bulk purchase procedures is restricted to 
situations in which:
    (1) A continuing substantial volume of individual travel via the 
same mode and class of transportation is required

[[Page 469]]

between one origin and one destination;
    (2) Each one-way or round trip single fare for transportation does 
not exceed $250 exclusive of Federal transportation tax; and
    (3) Each group of tickets or tokens is to be used within any one 60-
day period of a fiscal year.
    (c) Agency regulations governing use of the quantity-purchase 
system. Each agency adopting the quantity-ticket-purchase method shall 
issue internal instructions clearly defining the particular 
circumstances and conditions under which transportation tickets may be 
purchased in quantity. Further, each agency shall establish specific 
accountability controls for stocks of tickets and tokens and for 
periodically reviewing its regulations to ensure maintenance of a 
reasonable and objective quantity purchase program.

Sec. 101-41.203-4  Reduced rate services.

    Through fares, special fares, communtation fares, excursion fares, 
and reduced rate one-way and round-trip fares shall be used for official 
travel when it can be determined before starting a trip that all things 
considered, use of such service would be more practical and economical.


<R05>
Sec. 101-41.203-5  Joint procurement of rail transportation and accommodations.

    When the need for sleeping or parlor car accommodations is known at 
the time the rail transportation services are authorized, a single GTR 
shall be issued for joint procurement of transportation and 
accommodations. A separate GTR may be used to procure accommodations if 
such service is authorized after procurement of the rail transportation 
tickets; the GTR shall bear the name of the carrier issuing the sleeping 
or parlor car ticket and, when know, the number of the GTR covering the 
rail transportation service.


<R05>
Sec. 101-41.203-6  Air excess baggage service.

    (a) Cash shall generally be used to pay for the air carriage of 
authorized excess baggage when the cost thereof is $15 or less for each 
leg of a trip. (See Sec. 101-41.203-2.) When the charges will exceed 
$15, the air carrier to which the authorizing GTR is presented shall 
prepare one or more sets of a Government excess baggage authorization/
ticket (GEBAT) to provide a separate coupon for each change of flight, 
carrier, or stopover. It is essential to the payment process that the 
GTR number, the name and address of the office to be billed for the 
services furnished, and the name of the traveler, as shown on the 
authorizing GTR, be completely and accurately entered on the GEBAT.
    (b) The GEBAT coupons shall be given to the traveler with the air 
ticket for presentation to the honoring carriers. Each carrier that is 
to provide excess baggage service shall lift the pertinent coupon, 
complete if to show the gross and net weights or number of pieces of 
baggage carried, and use the coupon to support the subsequent billing of 
charges. The carrier providing the service may bill its charges direct 
to the paying office or may go foward the coupon to the carrier to which 
the GTR was tendered for billing.

Sec. 101-41.205  Special procedures for preparing agency-stocked tickets for passenger transportation services.


<R05>
Sec. 101-41.205-1  Use of teletype ticketing equipment.

    (a) Teleticketing systems. (1) Agencies are encouraged to adopt the 
use of teletype machines for issuing tickets for passenger 
transportation services (other than air excess baggage services) and the 
use of the systems concept of automatic payment as set forth in 
Sec. 101-41.206, whenever cost effective and feasible, so that the 
number of GTR's issued may be reduced and the expense and time expended 
in picking up tickets and processing individual carrier bills may be 
eliminated. Each agency should compare its current costs associated with 
passenger transportation procurement and payment with the potential 
costs of using a teleticketing and/or automatic payment system. Specific 
cost information can be obtained from the local communications company 
responsible for installing the teletype ticketing equipment. Also, 
agencies may jointly establish a teleticketing system on a common-use 
basis to reduce individual agency costs.
    (2) GSA has entered into a master contract with passenger-carrying 
members of the air transportation industry for teleticketing service. 
Copies of the contract, as well as information on agency procedures and 
responsibilities and GSA reporting requirements, may be obtained from 
the appropriate GSA regional office. Additional information and 
assistance is available from General Services Administration (FT), 
Washington, DC 20406. Under this teleticketing system, the contractor 
airline furnishes prenumbered teletype ticket stock and a validating 
stamp to the agency. The issuance of a ticket on that stock is 
accomplished by activation of the teletype equipment by the ticketing 
airline in response to a request from the agency. Each agency shall be 
responsible for establishing procedures and facilities for effectively 
maintaining accountability, control, and security of the teleticket 
receiver, ticket stock, validating stamp, tickets and ticket copies, and 
GTR's.
    (b) General procedures for issuing and processing teletype tickets. 
(1) At the beginning of each calendar week or of a mutually agreed upon 
payment period not exceeding 1 month, a so-called blanket GTR shall be 
issued for each agency or paying office using the service at a given 
location. The number of the GTR shall be furnished to the carrier each 
time transmission of a ticket is requested during the payment period so 
that it may be printed on the ticket. Any ticket transmitted by the 
carrier that does not bear the applicable GTR number shall not be 
validated or issued by the Government teletype clerk.
    (2) A separate ticket listing shall be maintained for each GTR to 
show the number and value of each ticket issued under it, the 
appropriation or fund chargeable, and other information that may be 
essential to agency and carrier fiscal requirements.
    (3) At the end of the payment period, payment shall be effected as 
set forth in Sec. 101-41.206.

[[Page 471]]

    (c) Procedures for processing unused tickets. All coupons of a 
completely unused ticket procured on a GTR that has not been processed 
for payment shall be marked ``VOID,'' and the pertinent entry on the 
ticket listing shall be lined out. All voided coupons other than the 
agent's coupon shall accompany the ticket listing when it is processed 
for payment. The agent's coupon shall be retained by the agency. A 
completely unused ticket procured on a GTR that has already been paid 
and all partially unused tickets, whether paid or not, shall be 
processed on Standard Form 1170, Redemption of Unused Tickets, to the 
contractor-carrier for refund under procedures set forth in Sec. 101-
41.210.

Sec. 101-41.205-2  Use of preprinted rail ticket stock.

    (a) Stocking of preprinted rail ticket stock. (1) Passenger 
transportation ticket stock, preprinted for rail travel between 
designated cities only, and other material essential to the preparation 
and issuance of the tickets are available to agencies under a master 
contract concluded between GSA and the National Railroad Passenger 
Corporation (Amtrak). Agencies desiring to adopt this system may procure 
a copy of the master contract and a ticket service agreement for 
execution by the agency and Amtrak, as well as information on agency 
procedures and responsibilities and GSA reporting requirements, from the 
appropriate GSA regional office. Additional information is available 
from General Services Administration (FT), Washington, DC 20406.
    (2) Under this contract, Amtrak furnishes the agency with a 
validating stamp, serially numbered ticket stock preprinted with origin 
and destination cities, and related material. Also, Amtrak is 
responsible for training agency personnel in the preparation and 
issuance of tickets and other essential services. Open ticket stock 
shall not be supplied or used under any circumstances. Each agency shall 
be responsible for establishing procedures and facilities for 
effectively maintaining accountability, control, and security of the 
ticket stock, validating stamp, tickets and ticket copies, and the stock 
of GTR's.
    (b) Procedures for issuing tickets under individual GTR's. Where few 
tickets are required each month, the agency shall prepare a GTR for each 
ticket issued and maintain a listing of all individual GTR's issued 
during the month. A completely unused ticket procured on a GTR that has 
not been processed for payment shall be voided and the pertinent entry 
on the GTR listing shall be lined out. All other unused tickets shall be 
processed under SF 1170 procedures as set forth in Sec. 101-41.210. 
Within 5 days after the end of the month, the originals of each 
procuring GTR, the agent's coupons of each ticket issued in that month, 
all copies of any spoiled or voided tickets prepared during the month, 
and the listing of issuances shall be forwarded to the designated Amtrak 
office for preparation of its bill for the applicable charges. A copy of 
the listing shall be retained by the agency for comparison with the 
billed charges.
    (c) Procedures for issuing and processing tickets under blanket 
GTR's. When the number of required tickets is of sufficient volume to 
warrant the use of automatic payment procedures as set forth in 
Sec. 101-41.206, a blanket GTR shall be used to cover all tickets issued 
during a mutually agreed upon period not exceeding 1 month. Tickets 
shall be issued as follows:
    (1) At the beginning of each payment period, a blanket GTR shall be 
prepared by the agency or paying office party to the ticket service 
agreement. The number of that GTR and of the ticket issued shall be 
furnished to Amtrak each time a reservation is requested. Each ticket 
shall bear the number of the procuring GTR.
    (2) A separate ticket listing shall be maintained for each GTR to 
show the number and value of the tickets issued during the payment 
period and such other information as may be agreed upon by Amtrak and 
the agency.
    (3) At the end of the payment period, payment shall be effected as 
set forth in Sec. 101-41.206.

[[Page 472]]

    (d) Procedures for processing unused tickets. A completely unused 
ticket procured on a GTR that has not been processed for payment shall 
be marked ``VOID,'' and the pertinent entry on the ticket listing shall 
be lined out. All coupons shall be accounted for and submitted to Amtrak 
with the ticket listing. A completely unused ticket procured on a GTR 
that has already been paid and all partially unused tickets, whether 
paid or not, shall be processed to Amtrak on Standard Form 1170 for 
refund under procedures set forth in Sec. 101-41.210.

auditor's and agent's coupons of each ticket issued but not voided 
during the period, all spoiled or completely unused tickets issued 
during the period, and the original and two copies of the ticket listing 
shall be forwarded to the responsible agency accounting activity for 
preparation of the appropriate disbursing documents and issuance of the 
check to the contractor-carrier for air transportation charges or to 
Amtrak for rail transportation charges. The payment check shall bear the 
name and location of the agency authorizing payment, the applicable GTR 
number, and the letters ``APP'' (for automatic payment procedures). For 
air service, the auditor's coupons and the original of the ticket 
listing for the period shall be sent to the contractor-carrier to 
facilitate distribution of the payment to the ticketing carriers. For 
Amtrak service, the agent's coupons and the original of the ticket 
listing shall be sent to Amtrak.
    (b) Agencies using the disbursing facilities of the Department of 
the Treasury shall issue Standard Form 1166 OCR, Voucher and Schedule of 
Payments (voucher-schedule), to the Department of the Treasury for 
issuance of the check. The payee block of the voucher-schedule shall 
include the above-cited identifying information that is to appear on the 
payment check. The stub attached to the SF 1166 OCR is not used in this 
instance and shall be destroyed.
    (c) The accounting activity shall send to the General Services 
Administration (FWAA/C), Washington, DC 20405:
    (1) The original of the blanket GTR (SF 1169);
    (2) A copy of the ticket listing; and
    (3) The agent's coupon of each ticket paid on the listing for air 
service, or the auditor's coupon of each ticket paid on a listing for 
Amtrak service.

    GTR's shall be issued and used only for officially authorized travel 
for the account of the United States GTR's shall not be issued or used 
to obtain transportation services or privileges personally desired but 
not required for official business, such as extra-fare trains or planes, 
stopovers, and indirect routings which increase or exceed the cost of 
the authorized transportation or service. When a service other than that 
authorized is requested by the traveler, the carrier shall collect the 
additional cost thereof, including the Federal transportation tax, from 
the traveler at the time the GTR is exchanged for tickets. GTR's shall 
not be issued to obtain official passenger transportation services 
costing $10 or less, exclusive of Federal transportation tax, or air 
excess baggage services costing $15 or less for each leg of a

[[Page 473]]

trip, unless special circumstances justify the issuance of a GTR.
    (a) Stopovers. Travelers required to make stops to conduct official 
business generally shall use only one GTR to procure a through ticket 
providing stopover privileges. Each stopover shall be specifically 
identified on the GTR.
    (b) Taxicab, intracity, transit services, toll charges, etc. GTR's 
shall not be used for individually procured taxicab, airport limousine, 
intracity transit, or so-called drive-yourself type or other for-hire 
automobile services nor for payment of toll road or toll bridge charges.


<R05>
Sec. 101-41.207-2  Preparation of GTR's.

    (a) Detailed instructions for the preparation of the GTR and related 
forms are furnished in the GSA guide ``How to Prepare and Process U.S. 
Government Transportation Requests'' (national stock number 7610-01-038-
1389). Agencies may obtain copies of the guide by submitting a 
requisition in FEDSTRIP/MILSTRIP format to the General Services 
Administration regional office providing support to the requesting 
activity. Copies also are available from the Superintendent of 
Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402.
    (b) The memorandum card copy (SF 1169-A) shall be prepared 
simultaneously with the original (SF 1169) and shall clearly show all 
information other than signatures that appears on the original at the 
time of surrender for service. Carrier agents shall not accept the 
memorandum card copy in lieu of the original.


<R05>
Sec. 101-41.207-3  Disposition of spoiled or canceled GTR's.

    A GTR spoiled in preparation, canceled, or prepared for issuance but 
not used shall be marked ``CANCELED'' across the face and forwarded 
immediately through the issuing office to the office maintaining the 
accountablility records. General Records Schedule 9, Travel and 
Transportation Records (see Sec. 101-11.404-2), provides instructions 
for the disposal of a GTR.


<R05>
Sec. 101-41.207-4  Accountability for GTR's.

    Each agency shall prescribe procedures to control GTR procurement, 
stocking, distribution, and accountability and shall establish 
safeguards to prevent their improper or unauthorized use. Each officer 
and employee of the Government or other person having custody of a GTR 
is responsible for its safekeeping and is liable for amounts which the 
Government may be required to pay because of improper use of the GTR 
resulting from fault or negligence of the custodian.


<R05>
Sec. 101-41.208  Validation and honoring of GTR's.


<R05>
Sec. 101-41.208-1  Validation of GTR's and identification of travelers.

    GTR's shall be completely filled out and properly signed by the 
issuing officer so as to be valid for presentation to obtain 
transportation services and/or accommodations. Carrier agents shall not 
honor GTR's which are incomplete or unsigned or which show erasures or 
alterations not validated by the initials of the issuing officer. 
Carriers shall require the person presenting a valid GTR to establish 
his identity as the traveler or party authorized to receive the ticket, 
exchange order, refund slip, or other transportation document. In the 
absence of satisfactory identification, the GTR shall not be honored.


<R05>
Sec. 101-41.208-2  GTR identification on tickets and coupons.

    Carriers shall stamp or endorse each coupon of the ticket, exchange 
order or other transportation document with the words ``U.S. 
GOVERNMENT'' and the serial number of the GTR authorizing the service. 
Each Government excess baggage authorization/ticket (GEBAT) shall show 
the GTR number, the complete name and address of the agency to which 
charges applicable to the excess baggage services shall be billed, and 
the name of the traveler, as shown on the authorizing GTR.


<R05>
Sec. 101-41.208-3  Honoring GTR's.

    The GTR shall be drawn on the carrier that is expected to furnish 
the service. However, a carrier other than

[[Page 474]]

the one named may honor the GTR provided the substitute carrier 
furnishes comparable service. When a different service or a service of 
lesser value is furnished, the type of service and the name of the 
carrier, if other than that shown on the GTR, shall be entered on the 
reverse of the GTR. That record shall be signed and dated by the carrier 
representative and countersigned by the traveler or person in charge of 
a group of travelers. The traveler or person in charge shall similarly 
endorse the memorandum card copy (SF 1169-A). If the original and the 
memorandum card copy are unavailable, the traveler or person in charge 
shall promptly forward written notification of the change to the office 
that issued the GTR. The carrier shall bill charges for the changed or 
lesser cost service to avoid subsequent adjustments with the Government.


<R05>
Sec. 101-41.208-4  Issuance and use of sleeping or parlor car tickets when accommodations are not assigned.

    (a) At the time a traveler presents a GTR authorizing sleeping or 
parlor car accommodations, the ticket agent shall issue a ticket 
therefor even if there is no guarantee that the accommodations will be 
available. This situation arises when a reservation cannot be made in 
advance for sleeping or parlor car service authorized to begin:
    (1) At an intermediate point;
    (2) At the initial point of travel but space is currently exhausted; 
or
    (3) At the return portion of a round trip.
    (b) It is incumbent upon the traveler holding such ticket to obtain 
an actual space assignment immediately upon arrival at the point where 
the authorized accommodations are to be furnished. When the service 
supplied is different or of a lesser value than that authorized by the 
ticket, the traveler shall secure written acknowledgment of that fact 
from the local ticket agent or conductor assigning the space and submit 
it promptly with a written report of the facts and circumstances, 
including reference to the number of the GTR exchanged for the ticket, 
to the office that issued the GTR. The traveler shall also forward with 
that report any unused tickets or transportation coupons in his 
possession.

<R05>
Sec. 101-41.208-5  En route honoring of GTR's for rail and sleeping or parlor car services.

    (a) When there is no ticket agent on duty, necessitating that 
tickets for rail transportation and/or sleeping or parlor car services 
be obtained at the nearest available point en route, the conductor 
shall:
    (1) Honor the GTR to the first station en route where such tickets 
can be obtained;
    (2) Endorse on the back of the GTR over his signature the points 
between which it was honored without tickets; and
    (3) Obtain the signature of the traveler below the endorsement.
    (b) The ticket agent at the station en route shall issue rail and/or 
sleeping or parlor car tickets from the initial point of service 
authorized on the GTR in exchange for the GTR.


<R05>
Sec. 101-41.208-6  En route honoring of GTR's for sleeping or parlor car services only.

    When a GTR is presented on the train for sleeping or parlor car 
accommodations only, it shall be honored by the conductor.


<R05>
Sec. 101-41.208-7  Honoring of GTR's by bus drivers.

    (a) When a GTR is presented direct to a bus driver:
    (1) At a bus station not supplied with the proper ticket forms;
    (2) At a nonagent station or flag stop; or
    (3) At a station at which the ticket office is not open for the sale 
of tickets, the bus driver shall honor the GTR to destination or arrange 
for its exchange for a ticket at some intermediate point.
    (b) When the GTR is exchanged at an intermediate ticket office, it 
shall be endorsed to show clearly that transportation was furnished from 
the point of origin of travel, not from the intermediate point at which 
the GTR was exchanged for a ticket.

Sec. 101-41.209  Unused transportation services or accommodations.


<R05>
Sec. 101-41.209-1  Reporting unfurnished or unused transportation services or accommodations.

    (a) An individual traveler or a person in charge of a group of 
travelers shall promptly submit to the appropriate office of his agency 
any unused tickets or coupons as well as a report identifying the 
appropriate GTR and setting forth pertinent facts if:
    (1) Travel is terminated short of the authorized destination;
    (2) Services actually furnished are different or of a lesser value 
than those authorized and the GTR cannot be so endorsed; or
    (3) The return portion of a round trip ticket is not used.
    (b) Lacking unused tickets or coupons as evidence of the unfurnished 
services, the traveler or person in charge of the group of travelers 
shall obtain written acknowledgement of the situation from the carrier's 
representative for submission with the report. If transportation and/or 
accommodations are furnished for a lesser number of persons than 
specified on a party ticket, the carrier's conductor or ticket collector 
shall note on the ticket or coupon the number of persons actually 
transported and the number and type of accommodations furnished.


<R05>
Sec. 101-41.209-2  Adjustments for unfurnished or unused transportation services or accommodations.

    All adjustments for unfurnished or unused services in connection 
with Government transportation must be processed through a Government 
agency. Travelers, issuing officers, or private individuals are not 
authorized to receive refunds, credits, or any other negotiable 
instruments for unfurnished services or unused tickets or portions 
thereof issued in exchange for GTR's. Carriers are accountable to the 
Government for refunds or adjustments improperly made to issuing 
officers or individuals traveling at Government expense. (See Sec. 101-
41.210 for procedures for collecting the value of unused or unfurnished 
services.)

<R05>
Sec. 101-41.209-3  Cancellation of reservations.

    A traveler shall cancel reservations for transportation services 
and/or accommodations as soon as he knows that such reservations will 
not be used. Failure of a traveler to take such action may subject him 
to liability for cancellation charges assessed by the carrier.


<R05>
Sec. 101-41.209-4  Denied boarding compensation.

    Each traveler shall be made aware that the tariffs of certain 
scheduled air carriers require the payment of liquidated damages in 
certain situations if the carriers fail to provide confirmed reserved 
space. Since the individual's travel on official business is for the 
account of the United States, the Government would be damaged by the 
delay or failure and would be entitled to reimbursement if a carrier is 
liable under its tariff provisions for liquidated damages. Thus the 
traveler who has been denied confirmed reserved space shall ensure that 
the liable carrier shows on the compensation check the ``Treasurer of 
the United States'' as payee. The traveler shall give the carrier a 
receipt for the check, retain a copy of the receipt, and forward the 
check with the copy of the receipt to his agency for deposit.


<R05>
Sec. 101-41.210  Ticket refund procedures.

    Agencies shall not revise carrier bills or require carriers to 
rebill items. Sections 101-41.210-5 and 101-41.210-6, respectively, 
contain procedures for recovering from carriers the value of exchanged, 
returned, or unused tickets when the carrier fails to make refund or 
otherwise satisfy an SF 1170 claim, or involves unused transportation 
services billed by foreign-flag carriers.

[[Page 476]]


<R05>
Sec. 101-41.210-1  Exchanged or returned tickets.

    (a) Exchanged or returned tickets are tickets in a carrier's 
possession for which the carrier has issued a lesser valued ticket, 
receipt, or refund application showing a refund due the U.S. Government. 
Agencies shall not submit an SF 1170 to the carrier to claim a refund 
for the unused value of an exchanged or returned ticket. Carriers are 
required to make refunds to the ``bill charges to'' office indicated on 
the GTR within 60 calendar days from date of ticket exchange. Agencies 
must provide travelers with a ``bill charges to'' address by attaching a 
copy of the GTR or some other document containing the information to the 
ticket or to the travel authorization. If carriers cannot identify the 
issuing agency, refunds shall be sent to GSA (BWCA), Washington, DC 
20405. These refunds are subject to the following procedures:
    (1) Carriers must include the traveler's name, GTR number, ticket 
number, amount being refunded, and any other information pertinent to 
the refund.
    (2) Agencies may make written inquiry to the carrier to obtain the 
above information for the purpose of recovering the refund from GSA.
    (b) When accepting exchanged or returned tickets purchased under a 
GTS account, the carrier must issue a receipt to the purchasing office 
showing a credit is due the agency.
    (c) When accepting exchanged or returned tickets purchased with a 
Government employee Diners Club charge card, the carrier must issue a 
receipt to the traveler showing a credit is due the traveler.

Sec. 101-41.210-1a  Agency monitoring and processing of exchanged ticket refunds.

    Agencies awaiting exchanged or returned ticket carrier refunds 
shall:
    (a) Obtain carrier refund applications or receipts from travelers 
for accounting purposes.
    (b) Record and deposit refunds in conformity with agency fiscal 
procedures.
    (c) Forward carrier refund applications and any other pertinent 
information to GSA (BWCA), Washington, DC 20405, if refund has not been 
received within 90 calendar days of date of ticket exchange or return.

<R05>
Sec. 101-41.210-2  Unused or unreturned tickets.

    Unused or unreturned tickets are those which have not been used for 
passenger service, exchanged, or returned to a carrier. Agencies shall 
demand the refund value of these tickets from carriers through the use 
of an SF 1170, Redemption of Unused Tickets. A separate SF 1170 must be 
prepard for each GTR, though more than one ticket or adjustment 
transaction may be related to that GTR. Each ticket must be listed on 
the SF 1170. Unused or unreturned tickets purchased under a GTS account 
must be returned to the appropriate Federal agency office, the Travel 
Management Center (TMC), or Scheduled Airline Traffic Office (SATO) that 
furnished the airline ticket. The TMC or SATO must issue a receipt to 
the agency showing a credit is due the agency. Unused or unreturned 
tickets purchased with a Government employee Diners Club charge card 
must be returned by the traveler to the TMC, SATO, or air carrier that 
issued the original ticket. The TMC, SATO, or air carrier must issue a 
receipt to the traveler showing a credit is due the employee. For 
procedures covering unused transportation services billed by foreign-
flag carriers, see Sec. 101-41.210-6.

Sec. 101-41.210-3  Agency processing of SF 1170 claims.

    Timely processing of SF 1170 is essential to facilitate prompt 
refunds from carriers. Agencies processing SF 1170 shall ensure that:
    (a) All copies clearly show the required details;
    (b) The original and the duplicate copy, together with pertinent 
unused tickets, are promptly forwarded to the carrier; and
    (c) All other copies are retained by the agency for accounting 
control.

Sec. 101-41.210-3a  Carrier processing of SF 1170 claims.

    Each carrier shall promptly refund monies to adjust items listed on 
an SF 1170, whether or not the related GTR has been submitted or paid. 
The carrier shall indicate on the original SF 1170 the amount credited 
to each ticket and the total amount being refunded, and shall return the 
original with its refund to the agency. A refund that is inconsistent 
with the information on the SF 1170 shall be explained or computed on 
the SF 1170 or in an attached letter. A carrier declining to refund 
shall furnish an explanation on the original SF 1170. If a carrier is 
unable to determine which agency submitted the SF 1170, the payment and 
refund information shall be sent directly to the General Services 
Administration (BWCA). Any refunds sent directly to GSA will be subject 
to the following procedures:
    (a) Carriers must include the traveler's name, GTR number, the 
ticket number, the amount being refunded, and any other information 
pertinent to the refund.
    (b) Agencies may make written inquiry directly to the carrier to 
obtain the above information for the purpose of recovering refunds from

    Upon return of the orignal SF 1170 with the refund, the agency shall 
record and deposit the refund in conformity with its fiscal procedures; 
and, if the refund has previously been reported to GSA as uncollected 
under Sec. 101-41.210-5, shall, within 30 calendar days of receipt

Sec. 101-41.210-5  Agency processing of SF 1170 claims for which the carrier failed to refund or otherwise satisfy the claim.

    (a) Partial tickets. A partial ticket is one in which one or more 
(but not all) coupons have been used. If, within 90 calendar days from 
the date of issuance of SF 1170, the carrier has failed to make refund 
for the unused portion of a partially used ticket or to furnish a 
satisfactory explanation as to why no refund is due, the agency shall 
transmit the triplicate copy of the SF 1170 and all related 
correspondence to the General Services Administration (BWCA), 
Washington, DC 20405, for a ppropriate action. An agency may remove from 
its active accounts those debts referred to GSA under this section. This 
shall be recorded in a manner sufficient to support its removal from 
agency accounting records. Should a refund or response be received from 
the carrier after referring the claim to GSA, the agency shall, within 
30 calendar days of receipt thereof, forward the original SF 1170, 
together with any advice from the carrier regarding the basis of the 
refund, to the General Services Administration (BWCA) in accordance with 
Sec. 101-41.210-4.
    (b) Complete tickets. A complete ticket is one in which no coupons 
have been used. If, within 30 calendar days from the date of issuance of 
SF 1170, the carrier has failed to make refund for a complete ticket or 
to furnish a satisifactory explanation as to why no refund is due, the 
agency shall take action to collect the debt under the Federal Claims 
Collection Standards, including administrative offset, if necessary.

    If, following the initial refund to GSA by the carrier of the value 
of an unused ticket which has expired, the ticket should subsequently be 
used for transportation or be refunded a second time through the use of 
an SF 1170, then either the value of the transportation or the amount of

GEBAT is later found, it will be marked `Canceled-Certification in Lieu 
Issued' and transmitted to the General Services Administration (BWAA/C), 
Washington, DC 20405, and no claim made thereon.'' The disbursing 
officer shall certify on the SF 1113 that the services specified therein 
have been furnished, that payment has not been made to any claimant, and 
that the record has been annotated to prevent duplicate payment.
    (b) Excess baggage charges supported by a certified statement 
instead of a lost GEBAT shall be billed separately from other types of 
transportation charges. Where the paying agency cannot be determined, 
the carrier may submit its bill to the General Services Administration 
(BWCA), Washington, DC 20405, for forwarding to the responsible agency.
    (c) An original GEBAT that is located after issuance of the 
certified statement instead of the lost GEBAT, together with a reference 
to the carrier's bill on which charges for the lost GEBAT were paid, 
shall be forwarded promptly to GSA (BWAA/C).

Sec. 101-41.214-4  Carrier notations on GTR's.

    Unnecessary notations should not be inserted on the GTR during audit 
by the carrier since it is essential that the GTR show transactions only 
between travelers and carrier agents. This should not be construed, 
however, as prohibiting mechanized interpretation in the designated 
spaces of the GTR or other desirable information notations.


<R05>
Sec. 101-41.214-5  Preparation of carrier billing form.

    (a) Instructions for the preparation of Standard Form 1113, Public

regional office providing support to the requesting activity. Copies are 
also available from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government 
Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402.
    (b) The billing carrier shall list the serial numbers of all 
accompanying GTR's on the face of the SF 1113, show the charge 
applicable to each GTR in the amount column, and complete the column 
with the total charge. As many GTR's as may be itemized in a single 
column shall be included on the SF 1113 when the charges are being 
billed to the same office; however, billings for air excess baggage 
charges shall be restricited to no more than three GTR's per SF 1113.
    (c) The carrier shall complete the ``Payee's Certificate'' section 
of the voucher. Carriers may use a machine-typed name of the carrier's 
certifying official, provided the machine-typed official's name is 
initialed by a duly authorized person; or carriers may use a facsimile 
signature of the carrier's certifying official, as authorized by that 
official. The carrier shall complete the tear-off portion of the SF 1113 
and shall not substitute a memorandum copy (SF 1113-A) for the tear-off 
portion.
    (d) An agency shall not require a carrier to furnish more than one 
memorandum copy (SF 1113-A).
    (e) Each carrier shall insert in the appropriate block on SF 1113 
(and SF 1113-A), the Standard Carrier Alpha Code (SCAC) assigned to that 
carrier in the National Motor Freight Traffic Association, Inc., Agent,

Sec. 101-41.302-2  Description and distribution of Government bills of lading.

    (a) The U.S. Government bill of lading (GBL) consists of six basic 
forms and is available in sets of seven or nine parts, depending on the 
number of memorandum copies needed. The sets are carbon-interleaved for 
simultaneous preparation. The GBL set is arranged in the following 
order.
    (1) SF 1103 (original), which refers to subpart 101-41.3 for the 
terms and conditions of the contract of transportation and contains both 
the description of the articles comprising the shipment and the 
certificate of delivery is given to the carrier upon tender of shipment 
for use as supporting documentation with the voucher covering the 
transportation charges involved.
    (2) SF 1104 (shipping order) is retained by the carrier's agent at 
the shipping point.
    (3) SF 1103-A (memorandum copy) for use by the shipper for fiscal or 
administrative purposes.
    (4) SF 1105 (freight waybill (original)) accompanies the shipment or 
is otherwise sent to destination in compliance with origin carrier's 
instructions. It also serves as the substitute billing document when the 
original GBL is lost.
    (5) SF 1106 (freight waybill (carrier's copy)) is for disposition by 
the carrier.
    (6) SF 1103-A (memorandum copy), of which there are two or four 
copies, is for use by the shipper for fiscal and administrative 
purposes.
    (7) SF 1103-B (memorandum copy-consignee) is sent to the consignee 
immediately after surrender of the original to the initial carrier.
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) The U.S. Government Bill of Lading-Privately Owned Personal 
Property (POPPGBL) is a seven-part form available in either snap-out or 
computer pin-feed formats. The sets are carbon interleaved for 
simultaneous preparation. The POPPGBL is arranged in the following 
order:
    (1) SF 1203 (original) is given to the carrier upon tender of the 
shipment for use as supporting documentation and is to be submitted with 
the voucher covering the transportation charges involved.
    (2) SF 1204 (shipping order) is retained by the carrier's agent at 
the shipping point.
    (3) SF 1203-A (memorandum copy), one of three copies, for use by the 
shipper for fiscal or administrative purposes. The remaining two 
memorandum copies are behind the SF 1203-B.
    (4) SF 1205 (freight waybill (original)) is given to the origin 
carrier and is either carried to destination or is otherwise sent to 
destination in compliance with origin carrier's instructions. It also 
serves as the substitute billing document when the original POPPGBL is 
lost or destroyed.
    (5) SF 1203-B (memorandum copy-consignee) is given to the consignee 
(property owner) at time of pickup of the shipment.
    (6) SF 1203-A (memorandum copy) same as (3).
    (7) SF 1203-A (memorandum copy) same as (3).
    (d) The GBL continuation sheets (SF 1109 through 1112) are also 
available in seven- or nine-part sets and are arranged in order 
corresponding to the GBL sets. The continuation sheets are for use with 
the regular GBL and the personal property GBL.

<R05>
Sec. 101-41.302-3  Terms and conditions governing acceptance and use of GBL's.

    (a) In no case shall prepayment of charges be demanded by the 
carrier nor collection be made from the consignee. The GBL, properly 
certified and attached to an SF 1113, Public Voucher

[[Page 484]]

for Transportation Charges, shall be presented to the paying office 
indicated in the ``Bill Charges To'' section on the face of the GBL for 
payment to:
    (1) The last carrier or forwarder in privity with the contract of 
carriage as evidenced by the covering GBL;
    (2) A participating carrier or forwarder in privity with the 
contract of carriage as evidenced by the covering GBL when the bill is 
submitted with a waiver accomplished by the last carrier (as described 
in paragraph (a)(1) of this section) in favor of the billing carrier;
    (3) A carrier (as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section) or 
its properly designated warehouse agent billing in the name of the 
carrier as authorized in Sec. 101-41.309-2 dealing with certification of 
shipments in storage; or
    (4) An agent of the carrier or forwarder (as described in paragraph 
(a) (1) or (2) of this section): Provided, The bill is submitted in the 
name of the principal. The agent's mailing address may be shown on those 
bills, and the checks, drawn in the name of the principal, may be mailed 
to the agent.
    (b) The GBL is subject to the same rules and conditions as govern 
shipments made on the usual commercial forms unless otherwise 
specifically provided or stated herein.
    (c) The shipment made on the GBL shall take a rate no higher than 
that chargeable had the shipment been made on the uniform straight bill 
of lading, uniform express receipt, or any other form provided for 
commercial shipments.
    (d) No charge shall be made by any carrier for the execution and 
presentation of a GBL in manner and form as provided in this subpart 
101-41.3.
    (e) The shipment is made at the restricted or limited valuation 
specified in the tariff or classification or established under section 
10721 of the Revised Interstate Commerce Act (49 U.S.C. 10721), formerly 
section 22 of the Interstate Commerce Act, or to another equivalent 
contract, arrangement, or exemption from regulation at or under which 
the lowest rate is available, unless otherwise indicated on the face of 
the GBL.
    (f) Receipt for the shipment is subject to the consignee's 
annotation of loss, damage, or shrinkage on the delivering carrier's 
documents and the consignee's copy of the same documents. When loss or 
damage is not discovered until after delivery of shipment and receipt 
therefor, the consignee shall promptly notify, preferably by telephone, 
the nearest office of the last delivering carrier and extend to the 
carrier the privilege of examining the shipment.
    (g) In case of loss, damage, or shrinkage in transit, the rules and 
conditions governing commercial shipments, as they relate to the period 
within which notice thereof shall be given the carrier or to the period 
within which claim therefor shall be made or suit instituted, shall not 
apply. Deletion of this item will be considered valid only with the 
written concurrence of the Government official responsible for making 
the shipment.
    (h) Carrier's rights to shipping charges are not affected by facts 
set out in the issuing office section of the GBL.
    (i) The nondiscrimination clauses contained in section 202 of 
Executive Order 11246, as amended by Executive Order 11375, relative to 
equal employment opprotunity for all persons without regard to race, 
color, religion, sex, or national origin, and the implementating rules 
and regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Labor are incorporated be 
reference in the GBL.

<R05>
Sec. 101-41.302-4  General instructions for the preparation of GBL's and common problem areas.

    (a) Availability of guide. Instructions for the preparation of GBL's 
and related forms are furnished in the GSA guide ``How to Prepare and 
Process U.S. Government Bills of Lading'' (national stock number 7610-
00-682-6740). Agencies may obtain copies of the guide by submitting a 
requisition in FEDSTRIP/MILSTRIP format to the GSA regional office 
providing support to the requesting activity.
    (b) Use of U.S.-flag carriers. The use of U.S.-flag vessels by 
officers and employees of the United States for the transportation of 
their personal effects

[[Page 485]]

and the use of U.S.-flag certificated air carriers for any Government-
financed movement of freight by air is required by statute (46 U.S.C. 
1241 and 49 U.S.C. 1517) when such vessels and air carriers are 
available. Compliance with these statutes is required whether the United 
States pays the transportation charges to the carrier direct or through 
reimbursement of an individual or other entity. Uniform standards and 
procedures prescribed by the Comptroller General of the United States 
for guidance of all departments, agencies, officers, and employees of 
the United States; carriers; and others concerned, in conforming to 
these statutes are found in 4 CFR 52.2 and in various Comptroller 
General decisions.
    (c) Common problem areas. (1) The ``For Use of Billing Carrier 
Only'' section is reserved for recording certain data by the accounting 
officer of the billing carrier and must not be covered by marks or 
writing by others handling the GBL. This boxed section on the memorandum 
copies of the GBL form is available to the issuing officer for showing 
estimated transportation charges and such accounting classifications as 
may be required.
    (2) The issuing office shall complete the ``For Use of Issuing 
Office'' section of the GBL, including any GBL to be used by a 
contractor as shipper. Failure of the issuing office to show the date 
and number of the contract, purchase order, or other authority for the 
shipment and failure to show the f.o.b. point named therein may result 
in a carrier's refusal to accept the shipment from the contractor-
shipper. Accountability for GBL's used by a contractor-shipper remains 
with the issuing office. Thus the name and title of the issuing officer 
and the name and address of the issuing office, rather than those of the 
contractor-shipper, must appear on the GBL.
    (3) Erasures, interlineations, or alterations in GBL's must be 
authenticated and explained by the person who made them.
    (4) Subpart 101-40.7 provides a uniform system and forms for agency 
documentation of discrepancies or deficiencies incurred in shipments of 
materials to enable initiation and processing of claims against carriers 
for loss and damage, shortages, and the disposition of overages.

<R05>
Sec. 101-41.302-5  Pickup and delivery services.

    (a) Pertinent sections on the GBL indicating that the carrier 
furnished pickup service at origin shall be completed and initialed by 
the shipper or shipper's agent. In certain instances the tariff covering 
this service provides charges that are in addition to the line-haul rate 
or charges.
    (b) When a shipper or consignee so requests and if the carrier 
furnishes delivery service at destination in connection with a less-
than-carload or an any-quantity rail shipment or on shipments by other 
modes of transportation, the carrier shall check the appropriate box in 
the ``Certificate of Carrier Billing'' section on the GBL.
[50 FR 30708, July 29, 1985]


<R05>
Sec. 101-41.302-6  Special services.

    (a) Additional information or facts necessary to support higher 
charges resulting from accessorial or special services ordered and 
furnished incident to the line-haul transportation shall be inscribed on 
the face of the GBL in the section designated ``Marks and Annotations'' 
or on the reverse side of the GBL beneath the caption ``Special Services 
Ordered.'' The inscription shall contain the name of the carrier upon 
whom the request was made and the kind and scope of services ordered and 
shall be signed by or for the person ordering the services. If such an 
inscription is impractical, a statement containing the information and 
bearing the number of the covering GBL and signed by or for the person

Sec. 101-41.302-7  GBL correction notice.

    SF 1200 is used to alter or correct the GBL and the personal 
property GBL. It is a single sheet form, and the number of copies to be 
prepared and distributed will be a matter for each Federal agency to 
establish. Recipients of a correction notice will alter or correct the 
GBL as indicated on the notice and attach the form to the GBL. 
Preparation of SF 1200 is not required when alterations or corrections 
are made prior to the distribution of the GBL. The form is not subject 
to the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (94 Stat. 2812, 
44 U.S.C. chapter 35).

Sec. 101-41.303  Conversion of commercial bills of lading to GBL's.


<R05>
Sec. 101-41.303-1  Necessity for conversion.

    GBL procedures shall be followed to preclude a commercial bill of 
lading or a commercial express receipt from being used on shipments for 
the United States, except as provided by law or by this subpart 101-41.3 
or by a specific exception to this subpart. Payment of the 
transportation charges generally will not be made by the Government on 
such commercial documents alone. However, when a commercial bill of 
lading or commercial express receipt is unavoidably used on a shipment 
of property for the account of the United States under circumstances not 
authorized herein, the words ``TO BE CONVERTED TO A U.S. GOVERNMENT BILL 
OF LADING'' must be conspicuously inscribed on the original and all 
copies of the commercial document.


<R05>
Sec. 101-41.303-2  Conversion of commercial bills of lading.

    (a) A commercial bill of lading or a commercial express receipt may 
be converted to a GBL by either of the following procedures:
    (1) When the origin carrier requires the original commercial 
document, the shipper shall surrender it to the initial carrier's agent 
for his certification as follows:

INITIAL CARRIER'S AGENT, BY SIGNATURE BELOW, CERTIFIES THAT HE RECEIVED 
                      THE ORIGINAL OF THIS DOCUMENT

    The certification shall be written on the original and all copies of 
the commercial bill of lading or commercial express receipt, and a 
memorandum copy thereof shall be returned to the shipper for forwarding 
to the authorizing agency. The authorizing agency receiving the properly 
certified memorandum copy of the commercial bill of lading or commercial 
express receipt shall issue or cause to be issued a GBL, forward the GBL 
promptly to the origin carrier for transmittal to the billing carrier, 
and retain the memorandum copy of the commercial document. The billing 
carrier, having received both the original commercial document and the 
GBL from the origin carrier, shall execute the ``Certificate of Carrier 
Billing'' on the GBL, cross-reference both original documents, securely 
attach them together, and use the documents to support its billing.

    (2) When the origin carrier does not require the original commercial 
document, the shipper shall obtain the signature of the origin carrier's 
agent on the original and all copies and immediately forward the 
original to the agency that authorized the shipment. The authorizing 
agency shall issue or cause to be issued a GBL for the shipment 
involved. The original commercial document and the issued GBL, properly 
cross-referenced and securely attached together, shall then be forwarded 
to the origin carrier for transmittal to the billing carrier for 
execution of the ``Certificate of Carrier Billing'' and preparation of 
the SF 1113.
    (b) The signature of the initial carrier's agent shall not be 
required on GBL's converted from commercial documents when it appears on 
the commercial documents attached thereto.

Sec. 101-41.303-3  Lost commercial bills of lading.

    (a) When the original commercial bill of lading or commercial 
express receipt

[[Page 487]]

has been lost or destroyed and therefore is not available to the billing 
carrier, the shipper or origin carrier possessing an authentic copy of 
the commercial document may have it converted to a GBL by the agency 
that authorized the shipment.
    (b) The issuing office shall, before releasing the copy of the 
commercial document from which conversion is made, reproduce two 
additional copies of the authentic copy of the commercial document: One 
to be retained for its records and the other to be forwarded to the 
agency's paying office.
    (c) The issuing office shall forward the copy of the commercial 
document and the issued GBL, each properly cross-referenced and securely 
attached together, to the origin carrier for transmittal to the billing 
carrier which shall execute the carrier's certificate and use the two 
documents as support for its bill for the charges.
    (d) Each agency and department shall develop procedures and controls 
to preclude more than one GBL being issued for the same shipment and to 
preclude duplicate payment of the transportation charges involved.


<R05>
Sec. 101-41.303-4  Lost original commercial bills of lading subsequently recovered.

    When the original commercial bill of lading or commercial express 
receipt is recovered after conversion of an authentic copy of the 
commercial document to a GBL, the original commercial document shall be 
forwarded to the paying office of the agency concerned, with an 
appropriate reference to the previous conversion. If the transportation 
charges on the GBL converted from the copy of the commercial document 
have already been paid, the recovered original commercial bill of lading 
or commercial express receipt shall be marked ``VOID''; annotated with 
the disbursing office (D.O.) symbol number, the D.O. voucher number (or 
the GSA certificate of settlement number), and payment date; and 
transmitted to the General Services Administration (BWAA/C), Washington, 
DC 20405.

services are provided for in established tariffs, schedules, or tenders.

<R05>
Sec. 101-41.304-2  Limited authority to use commercial forms and procedures.

    (a) Discretionary authority to approve use of commercial forms and 
procedures. Subject to the limitations in paragraph (b) of this section, 
the head of an agency or his designee may elect to use commercial bills 
of lading or commercial express receipts and commercial procedures, 
rather than the regular GBL and related procedures to procure freight or 
express transportation services for certain small shipments. This 
discretionary authority is directed generally toward those situations 
involving shipments of a recurring nature where it is cumbersome and 
impractical to issue GBL's. In implementing this small shipment 
procedure, agencies shall adhere to the restrictions on the use of 
foreign-flag carriers as set forth in Sec. 101-41.302-4(b).
    (b) Limitations on use of commercial forms and procedures. The use 
of commercial forms and procedures for small shipments is subject to the 
limitations and instructions set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) through 
(b)(4) of this section.
    (1) Upon determination that commercial forms and procedures are to 
be used, the agency shall establish administrative regulations and 
procedures clearly defining the particular shipping circumstances and 
conditions for their use. Notice of adoption and of any subsequent 
cancellation of the small shipment procedure prescribed in this 
Sec. 101-41.304-2 shall be sent to the General Services Administration 
(BWCP), Washington, DC 20405.

[[Page 488]]

    (2) The use of commercial forms and procedures for small shipments, 
as prescribed in Sec. 101-41.304-2, shall be optional on the part of 
carriers and forwarders. However, a letter of agreement signifying 
acceptance of the arrangements must be executed and filed with the 
participating agency by the carrier or forwarder. That letter shall 
include the following provision:

    The shipments covered by this agreement are subject to the terms and 
conditions (except as to billing carrier and prepayment) set forth in 
Standard Form 1103, U.S. Government Bill of Lading, and any other 
applicable contract or agreement of the carrier for the transportation 
of shipments for the United States on U.S. Government bills of lading.


The letter of agreement also shall include, where applicable, the 
carrier's concurrence in the use of cash for payment of transportation 
charges for these shipments as set forth in paragraph (d)(3) of this 
section.
    (3) The commercial forms and procedures authorized in Sec. 101-
41.304-2 are to be applied only to the following types of shipments:
    (i) Shipments for which the transportation charges ordinarily do not 
exceed $100 per shipment and the occasional exception does not exceed 
that monetary limitation by an unreasonable amount.
    (ii) Single-parcel shipments via express, courier, small package, or 
similar carriers, without regard to shipping cost, if the parcel shipped 
weighs 70 pounds or less and does not exceed 108 inches in length and 
girth combined.
    (iii) Multi-parcel shipments via express, courier, small package, or 
similar carriers for which the transportation charges do not exceed $250 
per shipment.
    (4) Commercial forms and procedures shall not be used for household 
goods van shipments.
    (c) Billing of charges for transportation services furnished on 
commercial forms. Charges for transportation services furnished under 
commercial documenatation, as authorized by this Sec. 101-41.304-2, 
shall be billed by and paid to the origin carrier or forwarder and may 
not be waived to any other carrier or forwarder. Also, these charges 
shall be billed on the commercial forms customarily used by carriers, 
rather than on the SF 1113, in order to clearly identify the bills as 
commercial-type shipments.
    (d) Payment of charges for transportation services procured on 
commercial forms. (1) Payment of charges for transportation furnished 
under the commercial forms and procedures authorized herein are subject 
to the standards set forth in subpart 101-41.4.
    (2) Payment of charges for transportation services procured on 
commercial forms as prescribed in Sec. 101-41.304-2 may be made prior to 
or upon completion of service and at either origin or destination only 
upon presentation by the origin carrier or forwarder of the usual 
ticket, receipt, bill of lading, or equivalent document covering the 
service involved, subject to later recovery by deduction or otherwise of 
any payment made for any service not received as ordered by the United 
States. The commercial document shall be clearly annotated to indicate 
the point at which payment shall be made. Further, regarding shipments 
paid at origin, the consignee or receiver of a shipment not delivered in 
good order shall notify the shipper so that proper claim action may be 
initiated.
    (3) Payment may be made in cash from imprest funds at the option of 
the agency but only with the concurrence of the carrier or forwarder. 
Imprest fund disbursements, forms, and accountability for the 
transportation transactions specified herein shall be made in accordance 
with paragraph (d)(2) of this section and the regulations of the General 
Accounting Office relating to imprest funds.
    (4) All payments, including supplemental payments, are subject to 
otherwise applicable statutory limitations.
    (e) Administrative procedures for processing vouchers covering small 
shipments on commercial forms. (1) The disbursing forms and 
documentation prescribed by the Department of the Treasury shall be used 
for commercial-type billings. Agencies shall not classify these paid 
bills as transportation vouchers for submission to GSA for postpayment 
audit but shall retain them in file for site audit.
    (2) Supplemental transportation claims arising after payment of the

[[Page 489]]

original bills should ordinarily be settled by agencies direct with the 
carriers. However, claims involving a doubtful question of fact or law, 
or a question regarding the amounts properly due, may be forwarded to 
GSA (BWCA) for direct settlement as prescribed in subpart 101-41.6. The 
complete record shall be furnished including a reference to the 
appropriation or fund to be charged.
    (3) Each agency shall establish adequate procedures and controls to 
pre-vent and detect duplicate payments, properly account for 
expenditures, and require notice from the consignee when a discrepancy 
in shipment occurs. Agencies may prescribe the use of statistical 
sampling procedures in accordance with General Accounting Office 
regulations, for examining and approving those disbursement vouchers.

certificate or permit to operate as such in intrastate or interstate 
commerce.
    (b) Certifications. (1) Household goods or a mobile dwelling 
(including house trailer) shipped for the account of the United States 
may be placed in storage at destination for the account of the line-haul 
carrier and for ultimate delivery to the consignee or owner. Charges for 
transportation services from the point of pickup to the point of storage 
are payable to the delivering carrier, provided the covering GBL has 
been duly certified by the carrier's agent to show the following:
    (i) The described household goods were placed in storage in ________ 
(Name of destination warehouse) at ________________ (City and State) on 
________ (Date) or the described mobile dwelling (or house trailer) was 
placed in destination storage at ________________________ (Name and 
location of designated facility) on ________ (Date).
    (ii) Such shipment will be permitted to remain there for a period of 
____ days or such shorter period as may meet the demand of the consignee 
or the property owner or the authorized agent or either;
    (iii) The carrier transporting the shipment to the destination 
storage point assumes full carrier liability for the shipment during 
storage and until delivery to the property owner or his authorized agent 
within the designated storage period; and

[[Page 493]]

    (iv) Any payment to the carrier for transportation service from 
point of pickup to the point of destination storage is dependent upon 
ultimate delivery to the property owner or his authorized agent. The 
carrier agrees to return all or a portion of the payment to the United 
States when delivery to the property owner or his authorized agent 
cannot be accomplished because of complete or partial loss of the 
shipment within the Government-authorized storage period.
    (2) If space for certification on the GBL is insufficient, the above 
certificate of liability, printed on plain paper and making reference to 
the GBL number, shall be attached to the GBL.
    (3) The certificate may include a statement designating the 
warehouseman as an agent of the carrier with authority to receive 
payment in the name of the line-haul carrier for all storage-in-transit, 
delivery-out, and other applicable charges. A signed copy of the 
certificate shall be attached to the supplemental bill for such 
authorized billing. The supplemental bill, however, need not bear the 
carrier's original bill number.
    (c) Supplemental billing for accessorial charges. Standard Form 
1113, Public Voucher for Transportation Charges, bearing the same bill 
number as the linehaul carrier's original bill plus a letter suffix; 
e.g., 12345-A, shall be used to bill any accessorial charges accruing at 
the point of destination not included in the linehaul carrier's original 
billing. The voucher shall identify the bill of lading and tariff or 
quotation authority for the accessorial charges. The voucher shall be 
supported by the following:
    (1) A statement of services ordered and furnished, signed by or for 
the person who ordered the accessorial services;
    (2) A statement signed by the property owner or his authorized 
agent, certifying receipt of the property at his residence and listing 
any loss or damage;
    (3) A copy of the bill of lading bearing the fund citation; and,
    (4) A copy of the original SF 1113, Public Voucher for 
Transportation Charges, which was submitted by the linehaul carrier.

The originals of those statements listed in items 1 and 2 shall be used 
as support for accessorial charges.

department shall pay any properly documented bill (claim) for freight 
passenger transportation charges that is not excepted by the provisions 
of Sec. 101-41.604-2.
    (b) Each military disbursing office and civilian paying office shall 
ensure during its administrative examination of carriers' bills that the 
Standard Carrier Alpha Code (SCAC) identifier is entered on each 
Standard Form 1113, Public Voucher for Transportation Charges, and SF 
1113-A, Memorandum Copy. If the code is omitted, the forms and all 
supporting papers shall be returned to the carrier unpaid with a request 
that the SCAC be added to the forms.
    (c) Provisions of Public Law 77-560, 56 Stat. 306 (31 U.S.C. 3322, 
3528) relieve certifying and disbursing officers of liability for 
overpayments made for transportation furnished for the account of the 
United States on GBL's and GTR's when such overpayments are due to the 
use of improper transportation rates or classifications or to the 
failure to deduct proper amounts under agreements. However, agencies are 
not relieved of responsibility for:
    (1) Making an administrative determination that the transportation 
services for which payment is claimed were duly authorized, that such 
services represent a legal obligation under the appropriation or fund 
involved, that the carrier's bill is complete and supported with 
required documentation, and that all extensions and computations of 
charges are correct; and
    (2) Establishing procedures and controls to prevent duplicate 
payments, to recover any duplicate payments that may be made, and to 
perform an annual review of the effectiveness of those procedures.
    (3) Providing the carrier with notice of an apparent error, defect, 
or impropriety within 15 days of receipt of an invoice.
    (d) Carrier bills deemed proper for payment as set forth in the 
foregoing paragraph shall be paid upon presentation and before 
confirmation of service satisfactorily performed, provided:
    (1) For freight transportation (other than that excepted under 
Sec. 101-41.312 of this part), the ``Certificate of Carrier Billing'' on 
the GBL has been properly executed by the carrier; and

[[Page 498]]

    (2) For passenger transportation, the proper ticket, coupon, or 
equivalent document covering the involved service has been furnished by 
the carrier in exchange for the GTR.
    (e) For the purposes of determining whether interest penalties under 
the Prompt Payment Act, 31 U.S.C. 1801, are due, the date on which 
payment is due is 30 days after receipt of a proper carrier bill or 
claim.

of service subject to limitations prescribed by the Administrator of 
General Services or his designee: Provided, the carrier or forwarder has 
issued the usual ticket, receipt, bill of lading, or equivalent document 
covering the service involved. The joint standards also place

of charges for transportation services prior to Government confirmation 
of the satisfactory completion of such services to ensure that advance 
payments are not made to:
    (a) An assignee bank or financial institution under the authority of 
31 U.S.C. 3727 and 41 U.S.C. 15;
    (b) Payees who are in bankruptcy proceedings or are subject to the 
control of a receiver, trustee, or other similar representative;
    (c) Payees who consistently fail to refund overcharges without 
assertion of substantial defense or other valid reasons when notified by 
GSA or any other interested Government agency;
    (d) Payees who without good cause fail to make timely disposition or 
settlement of loss or damage or other claims asserted by agencies of the 
United States;
    (e) Payees owing substantial sums of money to the United States for 
which no adequate arrangements for settlement have been made;
    (f) Payees in such bad financial condition as to justify a 
determination that the Government's best interests require consideration 
of special payment rules for their account;
    (g) Payees who do business with the United States infrequently and 
who previously have not been administratively approved for payment upon 
presentation of bills; or
    (h) Any other person or business organization determined 
administratively for valid reasons to be ineligible for payment, unless, 
after review of the facts and in the absence of objection by the U.S. 
General Accounting Office, it is determined administratively that the 
best interests of the United States will not be jeopardized by such 
payment.

<R05>
Sec. 101-41.500  Scope and applicability of subpart.

    This subpart sets forth procedures applicable to the assertion of 
claims by the United States that arise our of freight and passenger

[50 FR 49847, Dec. 5, 1985]


<R05>
Sec. 101-41.501  Definitions.

    (a) The term overcharges as used herein means charges for 
transportation services in excess of those applicable thereto under 
tariffs lawfully on file with Federal or State transportation regulatory 
agencies, and charges in excess of those applicable thereto under rates, 
fares, and charges established pursuant to section 10721 of the Revised 
Interstate Commerce Act, as amended (49 U.S.C. 10721), or other 
equivalent contract, arrangement, or exemption from regulation.
    (b) The term ordinary debt as used herein means any administratively 
determined transportation-related debt other than an overcharge. 
Ordinary debts include, but are not limited to, payments for 
transportation services ordered and not furnished duplicate payments, 
and those involving loss and/or damage to property transported by 
carriers.
    (c) The term claim as used herein means any demand by the United 
States for the payment of overcharges, ordinary debts, fines, civil 
penalties, special charges, or interest.
[50 FR 49847, Dec. 5, 1985]


<R05>
Sec. 101-41.502  Examination of payments and initiation of collection action and assertion of claims.

    (a) Examination of payments. (1) Carrier bills and supporting 
documents that represent payments made by agency disbursing officers for 
freight and passenger transportation services shall be forwarded to the 
General Services Administration (BWAA/C), Washington, DC 20405, for 
audit. For the purpose of determining whether a claim exists, GSA will 
consider:
    (i) The document ordering the services furnished to determine the 
contractual basis upon which the rights of the Government and the 
carrier are based;
    (ii) The pertinent tariffs, special or reduced rate quotations, 
contracts, or agreements, to determine the proper charge for the 
services rendered;
    (iii) Decisions of the courts, regulatory bodies, and the 
Comptroller General affecting the rates, fares, and charges; and
    (iv) Information furnished by transportation officers, travelers, or 
agencies.
    (2) The General Services Administration is obligated to honor a 
carrier bill for charges properly due. However, GSA has a concurrent 
responsibility to question or disapprove that part of a payment to a 
carrier which is found to be illegal or mathematically incorrect or 
which is not accompanied by documented support establishing an 
obligation of the United States.
    (b) Notice of overcharge. (1) A GSA notice of overcharge is issued 
when it is determined that a carrier has been paid a sum in excess of 
that proper for the services rendered. This notice, which states a debt 
owned to the United States, sets forth: the amount paid; the basis for 
the proper charge for each Government bill of lading or Government 
transportation request; and cites applicable tariff references and other 
data relied upon to support the statement of difference. A separate 
notice of overcharge is stated for each Government bill of lading or 
Government transportation request and mailed to the billing carrier.
    (2) If the GBL or the GTR contains a contract provision relating to 
the assessment of interest, then interest shall be charged under the 
contract terms thereof. If neither contains such a provision, then 
interest shall be assessed under the Debt Collection Act (31 U.S.C. 
3717) and the Federal Claims Collection Standards, 4 CFR parts 101-105, 
and regulations published in 41 CFR parts 105-55.

[[Page 500]]

    (c) Notice of indebtedness. A GSA notice of indebtedness is issued 
when it is determined that an ordinary debt is due the United States. 
This notice sets forth the basis for the debt, the debtor's rights, 
interest, penalty and other consequences of nonpayment. The debt is due 
immediately. Interest accrues 30 calendar days after the mailing of the 
notice of indebtedness and is subject to interest charges, penalties and 
administrative costs as prescribed by 31 U.S.C. 3717.
[50 FR 49848, Dec. 5, 1985]


<R05>
Sec. 101-41.503  Refunds and/or protests to claims.

    (a) Carriers are requested to promptly refund amounts due the United 
States. Checks shall be made payable to the ``General Services 
Administration'' and mailed to the General Services Administration 
(BWCA), Washington, DC 20405.
    (b) A carrier that disagrees with a claim may protest by letter to 
the General Services Administration (BWCA), Washington, DC 20405. Since 
each claim is processed as a separate account receivable, the carrier 
shall use a separate letter for each claim being protested. The carrier 
shall present the basis for its protest and submit either the original 
or a legible copy of all documents substantiating its position. If the 
carrier believes that an amount less than that claimed is due, it should 
submit a check for the amount due, together with a full explanation of 
the reasons for believing the balance is not due. With reference to an 
ordinary debt, which is the subject of a notice of indebtedness, the 
carrier may: Inspect and copy the Government's records related to the 
claim; seek review by GSA of the claim decision; and/or enter into a 
written agreement for the payment of the claim. GSA will acknowledge 
receipt of each letter containing a substantive protest and upon 
completion of consideration will notify the carrier whether the claim 
has been sustained, amended, or canceled. Repetitious letters of protest 
will not serve to preclude the collection of claims found due.
[50 FR 49848, Dec. 5, 1985]


<R05>
Sec. 101-41.504  Collection action by other means.

    When a carrier fails to pay or protest a claim and GSA determines 
that the amount is still due the United States, GSA will effect 
collection by other means, as set forth in paragraphs (a) through (d) of 
this section.
    (a) When GSA has an indebted carrier's claim against the Government 
on hand for direct settlement, GSA will apply all or any portion of the 
amount determined to be due the carrier to the Government's outstanding 
claim, in accordance with the Federal Claims Collection Act.
    (b) When the action outlined in paragraph (a) of this section cannot 
be taken, GSA will instruct one or more Government disbursing offices to 
deduct the amount due the United States from an unpaid carrier's bill. A 
3-year limitation applies on the deduction of overcharges from amounts 
due a carrier or forwarder (31 U.S.C. 3726); and, a 10-year limitation 
applies on the deduction of ordinary debts (31 U.S.C. 3716).
    (c) When collection cannot be effected through either of the above 
procedures, GSA normally sends two additional demand letters to the 
indebted carrier requesting payment of the amount due within a specified 
time. Lacking satisfactory response, GSA may place a complete stop order 
against amounts otherwise payable to the indebted carrier by placing the 
name of that carrier on the Department of the Army ``List of Contractors 
Indebted to the United States.''
    (d) When actions to effect collection, as stated in the preceding 
paragraphs (a) through (c), are unsuccessful, GSA may report the debt to 
the Department of Justice for collection, litigation, and related 
proceedings, as prescribed in 4 CFR part 105.
[50 FR 49848, Dec. 5, 1985]


<R05>
Sec. 101-41.505  Deposition of collections.

    (a) Amounts collected by GSA to liquidate debts asserted in the 
audit of transportation accounts are generally deposited in the Treasury 
of the United States as a credit to the appropriation or fund accounts 
against which the original payments were charged. When

[[Page 501]]

the accounts are not readily identifiable on the basic procurement 
documents, the collected amounts are deposited to miscellaneous 
receipts. Collections identified with certain Department of Defense 
activities are deposited to the appropriate military management fund 
rather than to the account from which the original payment was made.
    (b) GSA informs agencies of the amounts and account symbol numbers 
when collections are credited to the original payment appropriations or 
funds or to the military management fund but does not inform agencies of 
collections deposited to miscellaneous receipts. GSA records credits by 
account symbol numbers only to the basic appropriation level and 
requires no explanation by agencies regarding subsequent expenditure of 
the credited moneys.

<R05>
Sec. 101-41.506  Transportation debts administratively determined to be due the United States.

    (a) Under the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended (31 
U.S.C. 3711, et seq.), the Comptroller General and the Attorney General 
have joint responsibility for promulgating standards for the collection, 
compromise, termination or suspension of collection action on any debts 
determined to be due the United States. Regulations defining agency 
responsibilities for collecting amounts determined to be due the United 
States, establishing principles governing agency collection procedures 
for reporting uncollectible debts to the General Accounting Office (GAO) 
or the Department of Justice, are found in 4 CFR parts 101 through 105 
and in the GAO Policy and Procedures Manual for Guidance of Federal 
Agencies.
    (b) Agencies shall refer all administratively determined 
transportation debts involving loss and/or damage to property to: Claims 
Group, Accounting and Financial Management Division, U.S. General 
Accounting Office, Washington, DC 20548.
    (c) The Director, Office of Transportation Audits, has the authority 
and responsibility to audit and settle all accounts arising from the 
payment for domestic and foreign freight and passenger transportation 
services furnished for the account of the United States under the 
provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3726 without regard to monetary limitations. He/
she initiates actions on claims arising from his/her audit and 
settlement activities.
    (d) Whenever feasible, debts owed to the United States, together 
with interest, administrative charges and penalty charges, should be 
collected in full. If the debtor requests installment payments, the 
Director, Office of Transportation Audits, shall determine the financial 
hardship of the debtor and may arrange installment payments.
    (e) All liquidated or certain claims (those upon which all audit 
procedures under 31 U.S.C. 3726 have been completed) over $20,000, 
exclusive of interest, penalties and administrative charges which cannot 
be collected, shall be referred to the Department of Justice.
    (f) The Director, Office of Transportation Audits, may terminate 
collection action on, or settle by compromise at less than the principal 
amount liquidated or certain claims not exceeding $20,000 exclusive of 
interest, penalties and administrative charges if:
    (1) The debtor shows an inability to pay the full amount within a 
reasonable time;
    (2) Complete collection is not enforceable within a reasonable time;
    (3) The amount of the claim does not justify the foreseeable 
collection cost; or
    (4) There are uncertain litigative probabilities.
    (g) The Director, Office of Transportation Audits, shall prescribe 
internal regulations for the guidance of GSA personnel collecting claims 
arising from the audit of transportation accounts.

                         Transportation Services


<R05>
Sec. 101-41.600  Scope and applicability of subpart.

    This subpart sets forth procedures applicable to the presentation, 
settlement, reconsideration, and review of claims against the United 
States relating to freight and passenger transportation services, and 
implementation of the Prompt Payment Act, 31 U.S.C. 1801.

(31 U.S.C. 3726, 31 U.S.C. 1801, and 40 U.S.C. 486(c))
[48 FR 35650, Aug. 5, 1983]


<R05>
Sec. 101-41.601  Definition.

    The word claims as used in this subpart includes:
    (a) Requests by claimants for amounts not included in the original 
billing;
    (b) Requests by claimants for amounts deducted or set off by the 
Government;
    (c) Requests by claimants for amounts previously refunded by 
carriers; or
    (d) Unpaid original bills requiring direct settlement by GSA, 
including those subject to doubt regarding the propriety of payment.


<R05>
Sec. 101-41.602  Statutory limitations on filing of claims.

    (a) 31 U.S.C. 3726, as amended, imposes a limitation, generally 3-
years, on the filing of claims cognizable by GSA when such claims 
involve charges for transportation within the purview of 31 U.S.C. 3726, 
as amended. Claims in this category are those which involve 
transportation charges based on tariffs lawfully on file with Federal 
and State transportation regulatory agencies or which involve rates, 
fares, and charges established under section 10721 of the Revised 
Interstate Commerce Act, (49 U.S.C. 10721), formerly section 22 of the 
Interstate Commerce Act, or other equivalent contract, arrangements, or 
exemption from regulation.
    (b) A claim must be received by GSA or its designee (the agency out 
of whose activities the claim arose) within 3 years (not including any 
time of war) from whichever is the latest of the following dates:
    (1) Accrual of the cause of action thereon;
    (2) Payment of charges for the transportation involved;
    (3) Subsequent refund for overpayment of such charges; or
    (4) Deduction made under 31 U.S.C. 3726, as amended.
    (c) Each claim of a carrier or forwarder, whether filed with GSA or 
with its designee (the agency out of whose activities the transaction 
arose), must be clearly stamped with the month, day, and year of receipt 
by GSA or the designee agency so that there will be no question 
regarding the filing date when the determination of compliance with the 
3-year limitation imposed thereon by 31 U.S.C. 3726 is made and for the 
purposes of the Prompt Payment Act.
    (d) For the purposes of determining whether interest penalties under 
the Prompt Payment Act are due, the date on which payment is due is 30 
days after receipt of a proper carrier bill or claim.

Sec. 101-41.603  Presentation of claims.


<R05>
Sec. 101-41.603-1  Filing requirements for claimants.

    Claims shall be presented in writing:
    (a) Over the bona fide signature of the individual claimant or the 
claimant carrier's authorized official; or
    (b) Over the signature of the claimant's agent or attorney 
accompanied by a duly executed power of attorney or other documentary 
evidence of the agent's or attorney's right to act for the claimant.


<R05>
Sec. 101-41.603-2  Form of claims.

    (a) Charges claimed for passenger or freight transportation services 
shall be

[[Page 503]]

billed on Standard Form 1113, Public Voucher for Transportation Charges, 
in the manner prescribed in Secs. 101-41.214 and 101-41.310. Those 
claims for an amount in addition to that originally paid to the carrier 
for the same service, or for an amount collected by GSA or by another 
agency shall be presented on SF 1113 in the form of a supplemental bill 
(claim) bearing the same number as the original bill but with an 
alphabetical suffix. An alphabetical sequence of suffixes shall be used 
for any additional supplemental bills. Each supplemental bill (claim) 
for freight transportation services shall be accompanied by a copy of 
the GBL ordering the service and a copy of the original voucher which 
was submitted by the linehaul carrier. Generally only one supplemental 
bill shall be presented for all supplemental charges relating to the 
items paid on the original bill.
    (b) Each supplemental bill shall cover charges relating to bills of 
lading or transportation requests paid on one original bill. However, if 
supplemental bills (claims) arise from asserted retroactive increases in 
charges or from currency fluctuations, GSA (BW) will consider a 
carrier's written request for the single billing of such charges 
applicable to multiple original bills, if such request bears the 
concurrence of the agency's paying office.
    (c) Claims supplemental to passenger transportation charges 
previously paid under the automatic payment system set forth in 
Sec. 101-41.206 shall show the GTR number, ticket number, and period 
under which the original charges were paid.

<R05>
Sec. 101-41.603-3  Documentation required for claim settlements.

    (a) A claim is settled on the basis of the contract of carriage as 
evidenced by the bill of lading, transportation request, or other 
contractual agreement; the payment record; reports and information 
available to GSA and/or to the agency out of whose activities the 
transaction arose; and the written and documentary record submitted by 
the claimant. Oral presentations supplementing the written record are 
not acceptable.
    (b) Settlements are founded on a determination of the legal 
liability of the United States under the factual situation disclosed by 
the record. The burden is on the claimant to establish the liability of 
the United States and the claimant's right to payment. Clear and 
detailed documentation by the claimant is essential to the claim 
settlement; bare assertions or conclusions are not acceptable.


<R05>
Sec. 101-41.603-4  Where to file transportation claims.

    (a) Claims involving collection actions resulting from the 
transportation audit performed by the General Services Administration 
must be filed directly with GSA (BWCA). Any claims so submitted to GSA 
will be considered ``disputed claims'' under section 4(b) of the Prompt 
Payment Act. All other transportation claims generally shall be filed 
with the agency out of whose activities they arose; if that is not 
feasible (e.g. where the responsible agency cannot be determined or is 
no longer in existence) they may be sent to GSA (BWCA) for forwarding to 
the responsible agency or for direct settlement by GSA's transportation 
audit office. Claims for GSA processing shall be addressed to the 
General Services Administration (BWCA), Washington, DC 20405.
    (b) A claimant who disagrees with the action taken on his claim by 
the agency's payment office may request reconsideration or review of 
that action, provided he meets applicable time limitations. (See 
Sec. 101-41.602 of this subpart and subpart 101-41.7 of this part.) The 
levels for progression of claims not disposed of to the satisfaction of 
the claimant are as shown in the following table:

department shall pay any properly documented bill (claim) for freight or 
passenger transportation charges that is not excepted by the provisions 
of Sec. 101-41.604-2 provided the following guidelines are observed:
    (a) The agency shall annotate each paid claim, other than a bill for 
air excess baggage charges, with the payment record on the related 
procuring Government bill of lading (GBL) or Government transportation 
request (GTR) including Disbursing Office (DO) voucher number, bureau 
voucher number, date of payment, and DO symbol number.
    (b) The agency shall make an administrative examination of each 
claim to ensure that it is not a duplicate billing of a previous payment 
and that it is properly supported, presented in the name of the carrier 
to which the original charges were paid, and in agreement with agency 
records concerning the amount previously paid.
    (c) Claims paid in accordance with this Sec. 101-41.604-1 shall be 
transmitted to GSA (BWAA/C) separately from other paid transportation 
documents submitted for audit.

paid amount which is not in agreement with the agency's record of prior 
payment.

paid, except single-factor ocean rate adjustments (SFORA) on 
international household goods shipments. Each SFORA claim shall be 
billed on a separate Public Voucher for Transportation Charges, SF 1113, 
and the annotation ``SFORA claim'' shown on the SF 1113.
    (5) Claims described in paragraph (b) of this section are subject to 
GSA prepayment audit. Any claims so submitted to GSA will be considered 
`disputed claims' under Section 4(b) of the Prompt Payment Act.
    (6) Interest penalties under the Prompt Payment Act are not required 
when payment is delayed because of a disagreement between a Federal 
agency and a carrier or forwarder over the amount of the payment or 
other issues. Claims concerning any interest that may be payable will be 
resolved in accordance with the provisions of the Contract Disputes Act 
of 1978, 41 U.S.C. 601 et seq.
    (7) Irreconcilable claims disputing prepayment audit positions of 
agencies that are subject to a delegation of authority by the 
Administrator under Sec. 101-41.103. All claims protesting an audit 
activity's prepayment audit position will be addressed to that activity. 
The activity shall promptly acknowledge the claim in writing and stamp 
it with its date of receipt. The activity must adjudicate the claim 
within 30 days of receipt, but if the authority fails to approve all or 
any portion of the carrier's claim, it shall make a final decision 
providing a clear, specific, and detailed written explanation of its 
position. If the carrier is dissatisfied with the activity's final 
decision, it may appeal that decision to GSA, providing a copy of all 
documentation involved in the record, including a copy of the audit 
activity's decision. All such appeals shall be forwarded by the carrier 
to GSA, Attn: FWC (Code PA), Washington, DC 20405.
    (c) Claims described in paragraph (b) of this section will be 
handled by GSA under the provisions of Sec. 101-41.605 of this subpart 
and shall be forwarded separately from other types of transportation 
documents to the General Services Administration (BWCA), Washington, DC 
20405. Agencies shall support each claim forwarded to GSA with:
    (1) Appropriate certification of factual matters not considered in 
previous certifications;
    (2) Administrative report of any pertinent information not 
previously furnished;
    (3) Recommendation of the action to be taken;
    (4) Citations to previous payments, if any, by reference to 
disbursing office (D.O.) voucher number, date of payment, and D.O. 
symbol number; and
    (5) Citations to applicable appropriation or fund accounts. 
Administrative reports and recommendations are not required on claims 
for amounts collected by or through the efforts of GSA, but factual data 
that were not previously submitted shall be furnished.
    (d) Agencies shall notify claimants of the dates on which their 
claims are forwarded to GSA but shall not inform them of administrative 
recommendations. Agencies need not take further administrative action 
but shall forward to GSA (BWCA) any materials subsequently received 
which relate to forwarded claims and shall furnish supplemental reports 
to GSA when requested. Any claims so submitted to GSA will be considered 
`disputed claims' under Section 4(b) of the Prompt Payment Act.

Sec. 101-41.605  GSA processing of direct settlement claims.


<R05>
Sec. 101-41.605-1  Acknowledgments.

    Each claimant is informed of the number assigned to his claim upon 
its receipt in GSA. Claimants should withhold inquiries for at least 6 
months after receipt of acknowledgments because inquiries merely delay 
settlement action on the claims.


<R05>
Sec. 101-41.605-2  Processing claims certified for payment.

    (a) GSA certifies each payable claim by use of a GSA Form 7931, 
Certificate of Settlement, and includes therein a complete explanation 
of any amount that is disallowed. GSA forwards the certificate to the 
agency whose funds are to be charged for processing and prompt payment 
and concurrently forwards an advance copy of the certificate to the 
claimant. When an amount of the settlement is to be set off to recover a 
debt due the United States from the carrier, the agency shall effect 
such action immediately to preclude the setoff from being barred by 
expiration of the applicable statutory time period. (See Sec. 101-
41.501.)
    (b) An agency shall not revise or alter any GSA certificate of 
settlement except to indicate the appropriation symbol number applicable 
at the time of payment or to correct subsidiary accounting references 
relating to the stated appropriation or fund account. Alterations which 
will result in payment from a different appropriation or fund account or 
payment in an amount other than that originally stated on the 
certificate of settlement are not permitted. Any certificate of 
settlement that cannot be processed shall be immediately returned to GSA 
(BWCA) with an explanation of the nonpayment.
    (c) GSA forwards the original and four copies of each certificate of 
settlement to the agency by GSA Form 7933, Certificate of Settlement 
Transmittal, a copy of which shall be promptly receipted and returned to 
GSA (BWCA). When a setoff amount is to be credited to the accounts of 
other agencies, GSA supplies additional copies of the certificate for 
the agencies whose accounts are to be credited. The agency shall take 
action to effect issuance of the check or checks and shall distribute 
the certificate of settlement as follows:
    (1) Forward the original of the certificate, with the D.O. voucher 
number and date of payment stamped in the upper right corner, to GSA 
(BWCA). (The agency shall be responsible for preparing any required SF 
1096, Schedule of Voucher Deductions.)
    (2) Forward the claimant's notice copy to the payee with the 
settlement check.
    (3) Forward a copy of the certificate to each agency whose accounts 
are to be credited with a withheld amount, if any.
    (4) Retain the remaining copies for internal fiscal records, 
including support for the disbursing officer's accounts.
    (d) When the full amount certified for payment is setoff, GSA 
forwards both the advance copy and the notice copy of the certificate to 
the claimant and forwards the original and fiscal copies to the agency 
for processing and return of the annotated original certificate to GSA 
(BWCA). However, when the setoff amount is to be charged and credited to 
the same appropriation or fund account, GSA retains the original of the 
certificate and sends only the fiscal copies to the agency.

<R05>
Sec. 101-41.605-3  Disallowed claims.

    When a claim is wholly disallowed, the claimant is furnished GSA 
Form 7932, Settlement Certificate, completely explaining the 
disallowance. One copy of the settlement certificate is furnished to the 
agency concerned.

Sec. 101-41.606-1  Finality of action.

    Claimants may request reconsideration or review of GSA 
transportation claim settlement actions as set forth in subpart 101-
41.7. However, with reference to agencies of the Federal Government, 
these settlement actions are

[[Page 507]]

the final administrative action. (See Sec. 101-41.605-2(b).) A GSA claim 
settlement is not to be regarded as a precedent for agency determination 
of future payments by accountable or other adminstrative officers.

<R05>
Sec. 101-41.700  Protest to settlement action.

    (a) A claimant who disagrees with the action taken upon his claim in 
GSA's transportation audit may write to the Administrator of General 
Services, General Services Administration (BW), Washington, DC 20405, 
requesting reconsideration of the action. The letter shall identify the 
transaction and set forth in detail the legal, technical, or factual 
data or other information or documentation relied upon by the carrier to 
raise substantive doubt as to the correctness of the claim settlement.
    (b) A claimant who disagrees with the claim settlement action taken 
by an agency authorized by GSA to perform the transportation audit may 
address his request for reconsideration to the head of that agency. Such 
request shall include all information as indicated in paragraph (a) of 
this section.

Sec. 101-41.701  Review by the Comptroller General of the United States.

    (a) A claimant desiring a review of a transportation settlement 
action taken by GSA or by a designee agency may request review by the 
Comptroller General of the United States (4 CFR part 53). Settlement 
means any final administrative action taken by GSA or by a designee 
agency in connection with the audit of payments for transportation and 
related services furnished for the account of the United States, 
including:
    (1) Deduction from moneys otherwise due a carrier (or refund by 
carrier) to adjust asserted transportation overcharges;
    (2) Disallowance, either in whole or in part, of a claim or a 
supplemental bill for charges for transportation and related services; 
or
    (3) Any other action that entails finality of administrative 
consideration.
    (b) A request for review shall be forever barred unless received in 
the General Accounting Office within 6 months (not including time of 
war) from the date the settlement action was taken or within the periods 
of limitation specified in 31 U.S.C. 3726, as amended, whichever is 
later. The request should be addressed to the Comptroller General of the 
United States, U.S. General Accounting Office, Washington, DC 20548.

Sec. 101-41.802  Standard forms for scheduling transportation vouchers for payment.

    (a) The following Standard forms shall be used in connection with 
scheduling transportation vouchers for payment and audit:
    (1) SF 1096, Schedule of Voucher Deductions.

[[Page 508]]

    (2) SF 1166 OCR (Optical Character Recognition--Readable Format), 
Voucher and Schedule of Payments (Original) (white paper).
    (3) SF 1166-A OCR, Voucher and Schedule of Payments (Memorandum) 
(yellow paper).
    (4) SF 1166-EDP (Electronic Data Processing), Voucher and Schedule

    (7) SF 1186, Transmittal for Transportation Schedules and Related 
Basic Documents.
    (b) The procedures prescribed for preparation of SF 1166 OCR, 
Voucher and Schedule of Payments (voucher-schedule), are applicable to 
all Federal agencies using the disbursing facilities of the Department 
of the Treasury. The procedures prescribed for the use of SF 1166 OCR 
apply also to SF 1166-A OCR, SF 1167 OCR, and SF 1167-A OCR.
    (c) The procedures prescribed for SF 1186, Transmittal of 
Transportation Schedules and Related Basic Documents, are applicable to 
all Federal agencies required to send their transportation accounts to 
GSA for audit.

52 FR 12169, Apr. 15, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 101-41.803  Scheduling procedures.

    (a) Agency shall prepare a voucher-schedule (SF 1166 OCR) for all 
basic vouchers covering transportation services furnished for the 
account of the United States submitted by carriers in accordance with 
Secs. 101-41.214 and 101-41.310 of this part. Transportation vouchers 
(SF 1113) shall be listed separately from all other types of payment 
vouchers. All information required for check issuance purposes must be 
included on the SF 1166 OCR. After certification by the authorized 
certifying officer, the voucher-schedule shall be transmitted to the 
appropriate disbursing office. The transportation vouchers shall be 
retained by the agency for later transmittal to GSA (FWAA/C) in 
accordance with Sec. 101-41.807 of this subpart.
    (b) The tear-off slips from the related basic SF 1113 must also be 
sent to the disbursing office for forwarding to the carrier-payees with 
the payment checks. However, agencies submitting payment data on 
magnetic tape to a Department of the Treasury disbursing facility may 
arrange with that facility for the preparation of enclosures (TFS Form 
3039, Notice to Check Recipient), bearing all information shown on the 
tear-off slips, which must be sent to the carrier-payee with the payment 
checks instead of the tear-off slips.
    (c) Paid amounts must be clearly identified against individual 
carrier bills. Each carrier bill number and related payment amount for 
transportation charges and payment amount for interest, if any, for that 
bill number must be included in each check issue entry if the agency 
certifies on SF 1166 OCR, or it must be included as magnetic tape 
payment data if the agency certifies on SF 1166-EDP.
[52 FR 12170, Apr. 15, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 101-41.803-1  Classification of basic transportation vouchers for purposes of separate scheduling.

    (a) Basic transportation vouchers shall be sorted into three general 
classifications for separate listing on SF 1166 OCR:
    (1) Vouchers for charges payable in U.S. currency;
    (2) Vouchers for charges payable in foreign currency; and
    (3) ``No-check'' vouchers requiring no accounting transaction by the 
disbursing or accounting office.
    (b) Vouchers covering charges for intracity transit services; for 
local storage, drayage, and hauling services; or for small shipments not 
procured with GBL's as specified in Sec. 101-41.304 shall not be handled 
as transportation vouchers but shall be listed on voucher-schedules 
covering payments for other than transportation charges. The terms 
``intracity'' and ``local'' refer to services which are performed 
entirely within municipalities or contiguous commercial zones thereof 
and are not

[[Page 509]]

part of, or incident to, any arrangement for past or further 
transportation beyond the confines of these localities.

Sec. 101-41.804  Preparation of SF 1166 OCR, voucher and schedule of payments.


<R05>
Sec. 101-41.804-1  Assignment of schedule numbers.

    Each SF 1166 OCR covering transportation vouchers shall be assigned 
a schedule number prefixed by the letter ``T'' and taken from a series 
of numbers running consecutively for each fiscal year. The ``T'' numbers 
assigned to transportation voucher-schedules shall be taken from a 
series of numbers separate from the series assigned to voucher-schedules 
covering nontransportation charges.
[52 FR 12170, Apr. 15, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 101-41.804-2  Listing of items on SF 1166 OCR.

    Each basic voucher shall be listed on a voucher-schedule with all 
information required for check issuance purposes, and paid amounts must 
be clearly identified against individual carrier bills (see Sec. 101-
41.803 (a) and (c)). The maximum practical number of check issue 
entries, consistent with normal spacing requirements, shall be listed on 
each voucher-schedule page.
[52 FR 12170, Apr. 15, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 101-41.804-3  Combining payments due a single payee.

    If the amounts of two or more basic transportation vouchers due one 
payee can be combined in one check, the individual amounts shall be 
added and shown as one amount on the voucher-schedule, but the 
individual bureau voucher numbers (or schedule numbers individually 
identified by letter or number suffixes) must be listed separately in 
the voucher number column of the voucher-schedule. When the amounts of 
basic vouchers are combined into a single payment, an adding machine 
tape or facesheet listing the individual amounts shall be attached to 
the related group of basic vouchers.


<R05>
Sec. 101-41.804-4  Name and address space.

    Generally, the disbursing office draws checks only from information 
recorded on the SF 1166 OCR. Thus, except as provided in Sec. 101-
41.805, the information shown in the name and address column shall be 
complete (including ZIP codes) but shall be restricted to the 
information to be shown on the face of the check. Long addresses shall 
be avoided unless necessary for postal identification. The format and 
State abbreviations developed by the U.S. Postal Service for addressing 
envelopes shall be used.
[52 FR 12170, Apr. 15, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 101-41.804-5  Amount column.

    The amount for which the check is to be drawn shall be imprinted in 
the amount column on the same line as the payee's name. The total of the 
amount column on the SF 1166 OCR must include all items listed on the 
continuation sheets and must agree with the aggregate of amounts 
classified by appropriation or fund in the appropriation summary block.
[52 FR 12170, Apr. 15, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 101-41.804-6  Appropriation summary block.

    In the summary block of the voucher-schedule, the total amount 
chargeable to each appropriation or fund shall be shown on the same line 
as the fund account symbol. A breakdown beyond the basic appropriation 
generally need not be shown. However, if required for administrative 
purposes, it shall be shown in the summary block as in the following 
example:

7563901.....................................................   $1,020.00
  (.001--$582.00)
  (.002--$438.00)
7560271.....................................................      250.00

    Basic transportation vouchers for which no checks are to be issued 
to the voucher-payee shall be assigned bureau voucher numbers and 
scheduled as follows:

[[Page 510]]

    (a) Vouchers requiring the processing of an accounting transaction 
for inclusion in the agency's SF 224, Statement of Transactions 
(Classified According to Appropriation, Fund, and Receipt Account, and 
Related Control Totals); SF 1220, Statement of Transactions According to 
Appropriations, Funds, and Receipt Accounts; or SF 1221, Statement of 
Transactions According to Appropriations, Funds, and Receipt Accounts 
(Foreign Service Account), or other approved reporting form, by transfer 
or without the issuance of a check shall be listed on SF 1166 OCR 
covering transportation vouchers for which checks are to be issued. Show 
the words ``NO CHECK'' in the amount column of SF 1166 OCR opposite the 
payee's name and address. The amount shall be shown on SF 1096, Schedule 
of Voucker Deductions, as provided in Sec. 101-41.805-2.
    (b) Vouchers which do not require the processing of an accounting 
transaction by the disbursing or accounting office for inclusion in the 
ageny's SF 224, SF 1220, SF 1221, or other approved reporting form, 
shall be scheduled separately. Such voucher-schedules shall be plainly 
marked ``No-check vouchers.'' They shall not be submitted to disbursing 
officers for processing but shall be submitted to GSA (FWAA/C) for 
audit.

<R05>
Sec. 101-41.805-2  Deductions from disbursement vouchers.

    (a) When the payee of an approved basic voucher is not to receive 
the gross amount and a separate check must be drawn or a transfer made, 
SF 1096, Schedule of Voucher Deductions, shall be prepared for the 
amount or amounts of the voucher deductions. SF 1096 shall show, in 
addition to the data identifying the schedule by number, department, 
bureau, etc., the following:
    (1) The related voucher number from which the deduction is made;
    (2) Complete information regarding the purpose for which the voucher 
deduction is made;
    (3) The symbol of the appropriation or other account to be credited; 
and
    (4) The amount of the voucher deduction.
    (b) When a deduction is made to recover an amount charged to an 
appropriation or fund account other than one to which the voucher 
carrying the deduction is chargeable, reference must be made to the 
disbursing office (station) symbol number and the voucher number on 
which the amount was overpaid. When the voucher-schedule contains more 
than one voucher deduction, a summary by appropriation or fund accounts 
of all voucher deductions must be made on the voucher-schedule, showing 
the symbol of each account creditable.
    (c) When an amount is deducted from more than one basic voucher 
listed on an SF 1166 OCR, the agency shall take action as follows:
    (1) Show the net amount payable to each payee in the amount column 
of the SF 1166 OCR;
    (2) Record the total amount deducted as the last item in the address 
column of the SF 1166 OCR:

    See attached SF 1096 No. ____ $ ____;

    (3) List the deductions individually on an SF 1096; and
    (4) Annotate the basic voucher ``Paid in the amount of $____. See SF 
1096 No. ____.''

<R05>
Sec. 101-41.805-3  Vouchers payable in foreign currency.

    Disbursements to be made in a foreign currency shall be clearly 
indicated on the voucher-schedule by noting ``Payable in (name of 
currency)'' in the address column above the names and addresses of the 
payees. The individual amount due, expressed in the foreign currency, 
shall also be recorded in that column opposite each payee's name and 
adjacent to the amount column. The U.S. dollar equivalents shall be 
inserted in the amount column and in the appropriation summary block by 
the disbursing office.

scheduling such certificates for payment, the original and the 
claimant's notice copy of the certificate of settlement shall be 
forwarded with the voucher-schedule to the disbursing office. After 
return of the original voucher-schedule by the disbursing office, the 
agency shall attach to it a copy of the related certificate of

Recipient, TFS Form 3039 bearing all information shown on the tear-off 
slips), return two copies of the voucher-schedule to the issuing agency, 
and retain the original voucher-schedule to support its statements of 
accountability. If neither a tear-off slip nor a Notice to Check 
Recipient is provided, the carrier's bill number and related payment 
amount for transportation charges, and payment amount for interest, if

                         Categories of Property


<R05>
Sec. 101-42.200  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart prescribes the special policies and methods for the 
utilization and transfer of hazardous materials and other certain 
categories of property within the Government in addition to the 
requirements of part 101-43.


<R05>
Sec. 101-42.201  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 101-42.202  Identification of hazardous materials.

    (a) Current acquisition standards (Fed. Std. No. 313 and Fed. Std. 
No. 123) and the Federal Acquisition Regulation require that 
manufacturers identify and document potential hazards on material safety 
data sheets (MSDSs) as part of the acquisition process. Acquisition of 
MSDSs is also prescribed by the Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration (OSHA) regulations found in 29 CFR part 1910 and 
paragraph 1-602(c) of Executive Order 12196, Occupational Safety and 
Health Programs for Federal Employees, dated February 26, 1980. GSA's 
Federal Supply Service (4FQ) maintains an automated data base, 
accessible via modem and computer terminal, that contains MSDSs for all 
GSA-procured hazardous materials. In addition to display of the MSDS on 
the terminal screen, the system allows for the addition of the MSDS to 
the user's local data base and the transmission of the MSDS via 
facsimile to the user's site. Detailed instructions on how to access 
this system may be obtained by sending a self-addressed envelope to 
General Services Administration, Federal Supply Service, Attn: MSDS 
Coordinator, 401 W. Peachtree St., NE, suite 3021, Atlanta, Georgia 
30365.
    (b) The Hazardous Materials Information System (HMIS) is a 
collection of MSDS information, transportation information, and disposal 
information that was established by the Department of Defense to assist 
personnel who handle, store, ship, use or dispose of hazardous 
materials. Each record in the data base is defined by a stock number 
(either national stock number or local numbers), the manufacturer's 
contractor and Government entity (CAGE) code, and a part number 
indicator which is linked to the manufacturer's part number or trade 
name. The data base (DoD 6050.5L) is available on microfiche and compact 
disc-read only memory (CD-ROM) through the Naval Computer and 
Telecommunication Area Master Station, Atlantic (NCTAMS LANT), Attn.: 
Code 911.3, Norfolk, VA 23511-5355.
    (c) For items not listed or adequately described in the HMIS or on a 
MSDS, contact the procuring agency, the manufacturer, or your technical 
staff for information as to the potential hazards of the item.
    (d) Some hazardous items were acquired by Federal agencies prior to 
implementation of the standards requiring identification of potential 
hazards. Identification and documentation of the hazardous nature of 
such items is the responsibility of the owning or holding agency. 
Hazardous materials are found in most Federal supply classification 
(FSC) classes. Section 101-42.1101 contains a table of FSC classes 
composed predominantly of hazardous items and a table of FSC groups and 
classes which contain a significant number of hazardous items. These 
tables are designed to assist Federal agencies in reviewing personal 
property inventories to identify hazardous materials.
    (e) When an item has been determined hazardous, the owning Federal 
agency shall document the accountable inventory record accordingly. If 
the item has not been appropriately labeled by the manufacturer or 
distributor, the owning agency shall appropriately label, mark, or tag 
the item in accordance with OSHA requirements

[[Page 519]]

(29 CFR 1910.1200) regarding the actual or potential hazard associated 
with the handling, storage, or use of the item to include hazardous 
chemical(s) contained and the name of the chemical manufacturer, 
importer, or responsible party as defined at 29 CFR 1910.1200(c). Such 
information shall be maintained in the item record for use in 
preparation of reports of excess property, reassignment or transfer 
documentation, and other documentation requirements that may arise.


<R05>
Sec. 101-42.203  Reassignment of hazardous materials.

    When hazardous materials are reassigned within an executive agency, 
information on the actual or potential hazard shall be included in the 
documentation effecting the reassignment, and the recipient organization 
shall perpetuate in the inventory or control records visibility of the 
nature of the actual or potential hazard.


<R05>
Sec. 101-42.204  Reporting requirements.

    (a) Except as set forth in this 101-42.204, excess personal property 
which has been identified as hazardous shall be reported promptly in 
accordance with this part and Sec. 101-43.4801, with a complete 
description of the actual or potential hazard associated with the 
handling, storage, or use of the item.
    (b) If the hazardous characteristics of the item are adequately 
described on a MSDS or HMIS record (or equivalent), the reporting 
document should so indicate, and a copy of the MSDS or HMIS record shall 
be included. If no MSDS or HMIS is available, information must be 
obtained by the reporting activity and furnished with the reporting 
document. A certification by a duly authorized agency official that the 
item has been clearly labeled as prescribed in Sec. 101-42.202(e) should 
be included in the description of the hazard. The agency official must 
also certify that the containers and/or packaging meet or exceed 
Department of Transportation specifications for a hazardous material 
container (49 CFR parts 178-180).
    (c) Hazardous wastes shall not be reported to GSA for disposal, and 
shall be disposed of by the holding agency or the reporting activity 
only under the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and State and local 
regulations. Holding agencies shall contact the manufacturer, the 
agency's technical staff, or the local State EPA office for assistance 
in this matter if needed.


<R05>
Sec. 101-42.205  Exceptions to reporting.

    (a) When the actual or potential hazard is such that an item is 
determined by the holding agency to be extremely hazardous property, the 
item shall not be reported on Standard Form (SF) 120, Report of Excess 
Personal Property, unless so directed by a GSA regional office or GSA 
Central Office. Other items identified as hazardous shall be reported to 
GSA on SF 120 unless otherwise excepted by Secs. 101-43.304 and 101-
43.305.
    (b) When an item determined to be extremely hazardous property 
becomes excess, the holding agency shall notify the appropriate GSA 
regional personal property office, identify the item, and describe the 
actual or potential hazard associated with the handling, storage, or use 
of the item. On a case-by-case basis, the GSA regional office will 
determine the utilization, donation, sales, or other disposal 
requirements, and provide appropriate guidance to the holding agency.
    (c) When EPA, under its authorities, transfers accountability for 
hazardous materials to Federal, State, and local agencies, to research 
institutions, or to commercial businesses to conduct research or to 
perform the actual cleanup of a contaminated site, the item is not 
required to be reported.


<R05>
Sec. 101-42.206  Special requirements for utilization of hazardous materials and certain categories of property.

    Special utilization requirements for certain categories of property 
are provided in Sec. 101-42.1102. Many hazardous materials require 
special storage and handling. It is the responsibility of the holding 
agency to properly store hazardous materials and ensure the use of 
appropriate safeguards such as warning signs, labels, and use of 
protective clothing and equipment by utilization screeners who are 
inspecting excess hazardous materials.

[[Page 520]]


<R05>
Sec. 101-42.207  Transfer of hazardous materials and certain categories of property.

    (a) Excess hazardous materials may be transferred among Federal 
agencies under Sec. 101-43.309-5, except that the Standard Form (SF) 
122, Transfer Order Excess Personal Property, or any other transfer 
order form approved by GSA, shall contain a complete description of the 
actual or potential hazard associated with the handling, storage, or use 
of the item. Such description shall consist either of a written 
narrative, complying with the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.1200, in block 
13c or as an addendum, or an MSDS or HMIS data. In the absence of an 
MSDS, the HMIS data which fulfills the MSDS requirements must be 
attached if the receiving activity does not have the HMIS readily 
available. Otherwise, citation to the HMIS shall be provided. A 
certification by a duly authorized official that the item has been 
clearly labeled and its packaging meets OSHA and DOT requirements as set 
forth in Secs. 101-42.202(e) and 101-42.204 respectively, shall be 
included in the description of the hazard. The transferee shall prepare 
the SF 122, or any other transfer order form approved by GSA, under 
Sec. 101-43.4901-122.
    (b) The transferee agency shall document the inventory or control 
record of the transferred hazardous item to clearly reflect the actual 
or potential hazard associated with the handling, storage, or use of the 
item. If available, an MSDS or a citation or copy of the HMIS data must 
be filed with the SF 122 or automated requisitions on approved forms. 
Such visibility shall be maintained in the item record and on the 
property (labeled) to the extent required by Federal regulations to 
ensure the continued identification of the item as hazardous material.


<R05>
Sec. 101-42.208  Custody of hazardous materials.

    Custody of extremely hazardous materials shall be the responsibility 
of the owning or holding Federal agency. Custody of other hazardous 
materials may be transferred in whole or in part to another Federal 
agency with that agency's consent.


<R05>
Sec. 101-42.209  Cost of care and handling of hazardous materials and certain categories of property.

    The special handling requirements associated with many hazardous 
materials often increase the cost of core and handling of hazardous 
materials well above the usual costs incurred while holding excess 
personal property pending disposition. As provided in Sec. 101-43.310-1, 
each holding agency shall be responsible for, and bear the cost of, care 
and handling of excess property pending disposition, including those 
special costs associated with hazardous materials. Only the cost of 
transportation and handling incurred incident to the transfer of 
hazardous materials are borne by the transferee agency if billed by the 
holding agency in accordance with Sec. 101-43.309-3.

Sec. 101-42.1102  Special requirements for utilization, donation, sale, and abandonment or destruction of hazardous materials and certain categories of 
          property.


<R05>
Sec. 101-42.1102-1  Asbestos.

    (a) General. (1) Asbestos is the common name for a group of natural 
minerals that occur as masses of compact or relatively long silky 
fibers. The Environmental Protection Agency classified asbestos as a 
hazardous air pollutant in 1972.
    (2) Friable asbestos materials contain more than one percent 
asbestos by weight and can, by hand pressure, be crumbled, pulverized, 
or reduced to powder, thus allowing for potential release of asbestos 
fibers into the air.
    (3) Nonfriable asbestos materials cannot, when dry, be crumbled, 
pulverized, or reduced to powder by hand pressure and contain asbestos 
which is bonded or otherwise rendered unavailable for release into the 
atmosphere through normal usage. However, cutting, sanding, crushing, or 
performing some

[[Page 526]]

other disruptive action on items containing nonfriable asbestos can 
release asbestos fibers into the air.
    (4) As noted in this Sec. 101-42.1102-1, property containing friable 
asbestos normally shall not be transferred, donated, or sold. 
Notwithstanding these provisions, holding agencies may, on a case-by-
case basis, request approval from the GSA Central Office (which will 
consult with EPA) to transfer, donate, or sell such property if, in the 
judgement of the holding agency, special circumstances warrant such 
action.
    (b) Utilization requirements. (1) Excess personal property known to 
contain friable asbestos shall not be reported to GSA nor transferred 
among Federal agencies except as noted in Sec. 101-42.205(c) or 
paragraph (a)(4) of this section. GSA regional offices shall return any 
reports of excess property containing friable asbestos to the holding 
agency with instructions to dispose of the property under paragraph (e) 
of this section.
    (2) Excess personal property containing nonfriable asbestos shall be 
reported and processed in the normal manner, as provided for in part 
101-43, except that:
    (i) The Standard Form (SF) 120, Report of Excess Personal Property, 
and SF 122, Transfer Order, Excess Personal Property, and any other 
appropriate documentation shall include the following warning:

                                 Warning

    This property contains asbestos. Inhaling asbestos fibers may cause 
cancer. Do not release fibers by cutting, crushing, sanding, 
disassembling, or otherwise altering this property. End users and new 
owners, if transferred, should be warned. OSHA standards for personnel 
protection are codified at 29 CFR 1910.1001. EPA disposal standards are 
codified at 40 CFR part 763.

    (ii) Immediately after excess determination, all items of personal 
property known to contain nonfriable asbestos shall be labeled with a 
warning substantially as follows:

                                 Warning

    This property contains asbestos. Inhaling asbestos fibers may cause 
cancer. Do not release fibers by cutting, crushing, sanding, 
disassembling, or otherwise altering this property.

    (c) Donation requirements. (1) Surplus personal property containing 
friable asbestos shall not be donated. Such property shall be disposed 
of under paragraph (e) of this section.
    (2) Surplus personal property containing nonfriable asbestos may be 
donated in the normal manner as provided for in part 101-44, except 
that:
    (i) The Standard Form (SF) 123, Transfer Order Surplus Personal 
Property, and any other appropriate documentation shall include the 
warning as provided by paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.
    (ii) All items of personal property to be donated which contain 
nonfriable asbestos shall be labeled as provided by paragraph (b)(2)(ii) 
of this section.
    (d) Sales requirements. (1) Surplus personal property containing 
friable asbestos shall not be sold. Such property shall be disposed of 
under paragraph (e) of this section.
    (2) Surplus personal property containing nonfriable asbestos may be 
sold as provided for in part 101-45, except that:
    (i) Any documentation which lists the property to be sold and which 
is prepared incident to the sale, and any printed matter which 
advertises the sale of personal property containing nonfriable asbestos 
shall include the warning as provided by paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this 
section.
    (ii) All items of personal property to be sold which contain 
nonfriable asbestos shall be labeled as provided by paragraph (b)(2)(ii) 
of this section.
    (e) Abandonment and destruction. (1) Excess or surplus personal 
property which contains friable asbestos shall be disposed of by burial 
in a site which meets the requirements of 40 CFR 61.156. Holding 
agencies should contact the nearest office of the Environmental 
Protection Agency for assistance with regard to disposal of asbestos 
containing materials (with the exception of Department of Defense 
activities which should contact the Defense Logistics Agency).
    (2) Personal property containing nonfriable asbestos which is not 
transferred, donated, or sold shall be abandoned or destroyed as 
provided for in

[[Page 527]]

subpart 101-45.9. However, if the holding agency judges that the 
nonfriable asbestos contained in the property has the potential of 
becoming friable for any reason during the process of abandonment or 
destruction, such property shall be disposed of as provided in paragraph 
(e)(1) of this section.

Sec. 101-42.1102-2  Polychlorinated biphenyls.

    (a) General. (1) Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are one member of 
a class of chlorinated aromatic compounds which have been determined to 
be hazardous to health and the environment. They are used, among other 
things, as insulators and coolants for electric cables and components 
such as transformers and capacitors, as additives for extreme pressure 
lubricants, and as coatings in foundry use.
    (2) Substances containing PCBs are divided into three classes 
according to the concentration of PCBs present, as measured by parts per 
million (ppm).
    (i) Zero through 49 ppm is classified as an excluded PCB product.
    (ii) Fifty through 499 ppm PCB is classified as PCB item.
    (iii) Five hundred or greater ppm PCB is classified as PCB.

and reagents other than controlled substances may be separately packaged 
or may be components of a drug kit. Drug kits shall be clearly labeled 
to identify components unfit for human use. The holding agency shall 
destroy, as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, both separately 
packaged items and kit components which have been determined by the 
holding agency to be unfit for human use. However, items determined 
unfit because of expired shelf life may be transferred for animal 
experimental use on a case-by-case basis subject to prior approval by 
GSA.
    (b) Donation requirements. Surplus drugs, biologicals, and reagents 
other than controlled substances which are not required to be destroyed 
as provided in paragraph (d) and which are not transferred pursuant to 
paragraph (a) of this section may be donated to eligible organizations 
as provided in subpart 101-42.3 and part 101-44. Drugs, biologicals, and 
reagents which are unfit for human use will not be offered for donation. 
However, items determined unfit because of expired shelf life may be 
donated for animal experimental use on a case-by-case basis subject to 
prior approval by GSA.
    (1) When surplus drugs, biologicals, and reagents are considered for 
donation, a letter of clearance shall be obtained by the State agency or 
designated donee from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) indicating 
that the items requested may be safely donated. The letter of clearance 
must accompany the SF 123. Items which do not fall within the purview of 
FDA, or which FDA indicates are unsuitable, will not be considered by 
GSA for donation.
    (2) For purposes of obtaining the letter of clearance from FDA, the 
State agency or designated donee shall be responsible for obtaining 
samples from the holding agency, providing these samples to FDA, and 
ensuring the security of the samples while in transit. Before laboratory 
examinations are undertaken by FDA, an estimate of the expected cost of 
the quality assurance examination shall be furnished by FDA to the State 
agency or donee. Payment of any costs for laboratory examinations for 
quality assurance of samples shall be arranged by the State agency or 
donee.
    (3) Surplus drugs, biologicals, and reagents requested for donation 
by State agencies shall not be transported by the State agency or stored 
in its warehouse prior to distribution to donees. Arrangements will be 
made by the State agency for the donee to make direct pickup at the 
holding agency after approval by GSA and after notification by the 
holding agency that the property is ready for pickup.
    (4) Standard Forms 123 from a State agency requesting surplus drugs, 
biologicals, and reagents for donation shall not be processed or 
approved by GSA until it has been determined by the GSA donation 
representative that the specific donee is legally licensed to 
administer, dispense, store, or distribute such property.
    (5) The SF 123 shall also contain a statement that:
    (i) The property is being requested for donation to a specific donee 
whose complete name and address, including the name and telephone number 
of the donee's authorized representative, appear on the front of the SF 
123 in block 12, and that a copy of the donee's license, registration, 
or other legal authorization to administer, dispense, store, or 
distribute such property is attached and made a part of the SF 123;
    (ii) The items will be distributed only to institutions licensed and 
authorized to administer and dispense such items or to organizations 
authorized to store such items; and

[[Page 531]]

    (iii) In addition to the normal certifications required to be 
executed by authorized representatives of donee institutions or 
organizations when property is acquired by donation, the State agency 
shall obtain a certification from the donee indicating that:
    (A) The items transferred to the donee institution or organization 
will be safeguarded, dispensed, and administered under competent 
supervision;
    (B) Adequate facilities are available to effect full accountability 
and proper storage of the items under the Federal, State, and local 
statutes governing their acquisition, storage, and accountability;
    (C) The administration or use of the items requested shall be in 
compliance with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended (21 
U.S.C. 301-394).
    (c) Sales requirements. Surplus drugs, biologicals, and reagents 
other than controlled substances which are not required to be destroyed 
as provided in paragraph (d) and which are not transferred pursuant to 
paragraph (a) or (b) of this section may be offered for sale by sealed 
bid under the provisions of subparts 101-45.3 and 101-42.4. The 
following safeguards and instructions shall be observed to ensure 
stability, potency, and suitability of the product and its labeling for 
use in civilian channels:
    (1) Before reporting the surplus drugs, biologicals, and reagents to 
the selling agency pursuant to the provisions of Secs. 101-45.303 and 
101-42.402, holding agencies shall request that an examination be made 
by the Field Scientific Coordination Staff, ACFA-CF-30, located in the 
appropriate FDA district office, of surplus unexpired drugs and 
reagents, having an acquisition cost of $500 or more per manufacturer's 
lot/batch number.
    (i) When requesting such an examination, FDA requires the submission 
of a list and one sample of each of the drugs to be examined.
    (ii) Additional samples may be requested if necessary for laboratory 
examination. Reimbursement for examination of the surplus drugs or 
reagents may be required by FDA. Before laboratory examinations are 
undertaken, FDA will give the inquiring agency an estimate of the 
expected costs. If, under subpart 101-45.9, the cost of the quality 
assurance is not justified by the value of the material involved, the 
lot or lots may be destroyed.
    (iii) The reporting document prescribed in Sec. 101-45.303(b) shall 
have attached to it a copy of the letter received by the reporting 
agency from FDA stating that the articles offered have been reviewed and 
may appropriately be distributed or sold, subject when necessary to 
specified limitations.
    (2) Surplus drugs, biologicals, and reagents normally shall not be 
physically transferred to the selling agency but should remain at the 
holding agency for precautionary and safety measures.
    (3) Surplus drugs, biologicals, and reagents shall be sold only to 
those entities which are legally qualified to engage in the sale, 
manufacture, or distribution of such items.
    (4) Sales of surplus drugs, biologicals, and reagents other than 
controlled substances shall be processed as follows:
    (i) The invitation for bids (IFB) shall:
    (A) Consist only of surplus drugs, biologicals, and reagents;
    (B) Contain the expiration date of material being offered for sale;
    (C) Describe the composition of the material being offered for sale;
    (D) Require the normal bid deposit prescribed in Sec. 101-45.304-10; 
and
    (E) Contain the following special condition of sale:

    The bidder shall complete, sign, and return with his/her bid the 
certification as contained in this invitation. No award will be made or 
sale consummated until after this agency has determined that the bidder 
is legally licensed to engage in the manufacture, sale, or distribution 
of drugs.

    (ii) The following certification shall be made a part of the 
invitation for bids (and contract), to be completed and signed by the 
bidder, and returned with the bid with a copy of his/her license. 
Failure to sign the certification may result in the bid being rejected 
as nonresponsive.

    The bidder certifies that he/she is legally licensed to engage in 
the manufacture, sale, or distribution of drugs, and proof of his/her 
license to deal in such materials is furnished with this bid.

condition, in open or broken containers, recommended for destruction by 
FDA, unfit for human consumption, or otherwise unusable; and
    (ii) Surplus drugs, biologicals, and reagents which have been 
offered for sale under the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section 
but for which no satisfactory or acceptable bid or bids have been 
received.
    (2) When surplus drugs, biologicals, and reagents are required to be 
destroyed by the holding agency or State agency, they shall be destroyed 
in such a manner as to ensure total destruction of the substance to 
preclude the use of any portion thereof. When major amounts are to be

regulated, noncontrolled, condemned hazardous substances in Federal 
supply class (FSC) 6505 shall be destroyed without the witnessing by two 
employees of the agency. The controls which the Environmental Protection 
Agency places upon the disposal of RCRA regulated noncontrolled drugs, 
40 CFR part 260 et seq., are sufficiently stringent to ensure that these 
drugs will be destroyed without agency witnessing.
    (ii) It is the holding agency's responsibility to take all necessary 
measures to ensure that contractor performance is in accordance with the 
provisions of this Sec. 101-42.1102-5.
    (4) When surplus drugs, biologicals, and reagents have been 
destroyed, the fact, manner, and date of the destruction and type and 
quantity destroyed shall be so certified by the agency employee charged 
with the responsibility for that destruction. The two agency employees 
who witnessed the destruction shall sign the following statement, except 
as noted in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, which shall appear on the 
certification below the signature of the certifying employee:

    I have witnessed the destruction of the (drugs, biologicals, and

Witness                      Date

    (5) Items mentioned parenthetically in the statement contained in 
paragraph (d)(5) of this section which are not applicable at the time of 
destruction shall be deleted from the statement. The signed 
certification and statement of destruction shall be made a matter of 
record and shall be retained in the case files of the holding agency or 
State agency.

Sec. 101-42.1102-8  United States Munitions List items which require demilitarization.

    (a) General. The United States Munitions List is located in 22 CFR 
part 121. A system of demilitarization codes has been developed and an 
appropriate code assigned to each Munitions List Item (MLI) to describe 
what, if any, restrictions or actual demilitarization requirements apply 
to each item. These codes, in addition to demilitarization policy and 
procedures for all surplus military items which are owned, procured by, 
or under the control of the Department of Defense, are contained in the 
Defense Demilitarization Manual (DoD 4160.21-M-1). This Sec. 101-
42.1102-8 applies only to MLIs and is to be used in conjunction with 
guidance in parts 101-42, 101-44, and 101-45.
    (b) Utilization requirements. (1) Federal agencies acquiring MLIs 
which require demilitarization shall perpetuate the demilitarization 
codes in their property records and on subsequent reports of excess 
personal property submitted to GSA. Demilitarization shall be a 
condition of transfer of excess MLIs.
    (2) Utilization without demilitarization of other than classified 
material is authorized only under the conditions cited in the Defense 
Demilitarization Manual, DoD 4160.21-M-1.
    (c) Donation requirements. (1) Donation without demilitarization of 
other than classified material is authorized only under the conditions 
cited in the Defense Demilitarization Manual, DoD 4160.21-M-1.
    (2) A State agency requesting the transfer of donation of MLIs 
identified as requiring demilitarization shall include the appropriate 
demilitarization code on the SF 123, and a statement that the State 
agency will obtain from the donee a certification that prior to further 
disposition, demilitarization of the property shall be performed by the 
donee under the demilitarization instructions for the code as set forth 
in the Defense Demilitarization Manual, DoD 4160.21-M-1. In the case of 
MLIs requested for donation by service educational activities or public 
airports pursuant to the provisions of subparts 101-44.4 and 101-44.5 
respectively, the donee shall include a statement on the SF 123 
certifying that appropriate demilitarization of the property will be 
accomplished under the requirements of the codes before further 
disposition.
    (3) Before disposing of MLIs identified as requiring 
demilitarization, donees may request demilitarization instructions from 
GSA through the State agency if the donation was made pursuant to 
subpart 101-44.2. Demilitarization instructions for such items donated 
to public airports, under subpart 101-44.5, may be requested through the 
Federal Aviation Administration. Demilitarization instructions for such 
items donated to service educational activities under subpart 101-44.4 
may be obtained directly from the Item Technical Manager within DOD for 
the item involved.
    (4) Demilitarization of property to be donated to public bodies 
under subpart 101-44.7 shall be accomplished in a manner to preserve so 
far as possible any civilian use or commercial value of the property, as 
prescribed in the minimum demilitarization requirements of the Defense 
Demilitarization Manual, DoD 4160.21-M-1.
    (d) Sales requirements. (1) Except for sales authorized by statute, 
sales of ``explosives'' and ``ammunition components'' authorized by 
paragraphs (d) (2) and (3) of this section, or specialized sales 
authorized by the Secretary of Defense, MLIs identified as requiring 
demilitarization shall not be reported for public sale without first 
being demilitarized under the requirements of the assigned code in the 
Defense Demilitarization Manual, DoD 4160.21-M-1 or requiring 
demilitarization under the terms and conditions of sale. GSA will, as 
necessary, refer technical questions on demilitarization to the 
Department of Defense.
    (2) Explosives. For the purpose of this section, the term explosive 
means any chemical compound, mixture, or device, the primary or common 
purpose of which is to function by explosion. The term includes, but is 
not limited to, dynamite and other high explosives, black powder, pellet 
powder, initiating explosives, detonators, safety fuses, squibs, 
detonating cord, igniter cord, igniters, and any other items appearing 
in the explosives list issued by the Secretary of the Treasury (18 
U.S.C. 841(d)). The explosives list is published

[[Page 537]]

and revised at least annually in the Federal Register by the Director, 
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, Department of the Treasury, as 
required by 27 CFR 55.23. The following procedures shall apply in any 
disposal of explosives:
    (i) All explosives offered for sale shall be properly identified in 
the offering with respect to their hazardous characteristics.
    (ii) All explosives shall be labeled by the holding agency before 
shipment so that their hazardous or dangerous character will be 
immediately evident upon inspection.
    (iii) Purchasers of explosives shall be required, as a condition of 
sale, to execute the following certification:

    It is hereby certified that the purchaser will comply with all 
applicable Federal, State, and local laws, ordinances, and regulations 
with respect to the care, handling, storage, shipment, resale, export, 
and other use of the materials, hereby purchased, and that he/she is a 
user of, or dealer in, said materials and will comply with all 
applicable Federal, State, and local laws. This certification is made in 
accordance with and subject to the penalties of Title 18, Section 1001, 
the United States Code, Crime and Criminal Procedures.

    (3) Ammunition components. The term ``ammunition components'' means 
ammunition or cartridge cases, primers, bullets, or propellant powder 
designed for use in any firearm. The transportation of primers or 
propellent powder is governed by the Hazardous Materials Regulations (49 
CFR parts 170-189) promulgated by the Department of Transportation. 
Purchasers of such materials are responsible to certify, based on their 
own examination, that the materials are properly classified, described, 
packaged, marked, and labeled and are in proper condition for 
transportation in accordance with the Hazardous Materials Regulations. 
So that bidders will be notified of the special requirements concerning 
the purchase and transportation of usable ammunition components, the 
following statement shall be included in the IFBs and shall be made a 
part of the contract by including in it the bid form to be submitted by 
the bidders:

    Item No. ________ contains ammunition components offered for sale in 
this invitation. The undersigned certifies that he/she will comply with 
all applicable local, State, and Federal laws and regulations concerning 
ammunition components.

    (4) Scrap ammunition components. Ammunition components not usable or 
suitable for reuse as components of ammunition shall be reported and may 
be sold as scrap (for basic material content). With regard to such sale, 
the following statement shall be included in the invitation for bid and 
shall be made a part of the contract:

    I, ______, certify that ammunition components purchased by me as 
Item No. ________, will not be used for the original manufactured 
purpose.

    (e) Abandonment and destruction requirements. Besides the 
requirement of subpart 101-45.9, surplus munitions list items which 
require demilitarization shall be abandoned or disposed of under the 
requirements of Sec. 101-42.406, but only after performance of 
demilitarization under the requirements of the assigned code in the 
Defense Demilitarization Manual, DoD 4160.21-M-1.

                  Subpart 101-43.1--General Provisions

    Source: 53 FR 16092, May 5, 1988, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 101-43.101  Agency utilization reviews.

    Each executive agency shall continuously survey property under its 
control to assure maximum use and shall promptly make personal property 
that is excess to its needs available for transfer in accordance with 
this part.


<R05>
Sec. 101-43.102  Reassignment of personal property.

    (a) When property is determined to no longer be required for the 
purpose of the appropriation from which it was purchased or for the use 
to which it has been applied, an executive agency shall, to the maximum 
extent feasible, reassign the property within its activities, including 
its cost-reimbursement contractors as described in 48 CFR subpart 16.3, 
and shall immediately discontinue procurement of items for which the 
property can be substituted or adapted.

<R04>
                 Subpart 101-43.3--Utilization of Excess

    Source: 53 FR 16092, May 5, 1988, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 101-43.301  Federal Government procedure.

    The first source of supply is excess personal property, which shall 
be used by executive agencies to the fullest extent practicable as 
prescribed in this part. A requirement for personal property expressed 
by an authorized Federal activity identified in Sec. 101-43.309-1 shall 
supersede any disposal action. This means that Federal transfers may be 
accomplished for surplus property if the holding or selling agency is 
notified prior to shipment or delivery of donated property or prior to 
actual removal of property from Government control in the case of sale.


<R05>
Sec. 101-43.302  Agency responsibility.

    (a) To obtain maximum utilization and to minimize the procurement of 
new items, each executive agency shall be responsible for making excess 
personal property available and for facilitating the transfer of the 
property to other Federal agencies for direct use or for use by their 
authorized cost-reimbursement contractors, cooperatives, and project 
grantees, and to the organizations specified in Sec. 101-43.309-1. Each 
executive agency shall, to the maximum practicable extent, fulfill its 
requirements for property by obtaining

[[Page 545]]

excess personal property from other Federal agencies instead of 
initiating a new procurement.
    (b) Agencies receiving or transferring excess personal property 
shall establish controls over the processing of transfer orders and 
shall establish and maintain an adequate system of property 
accountability. Each Federal agency shall develop and maintain an 
effective system for the prevention and detection of situations 
involving the nonuse, improper use, or unauthorized disposal or 
destruction of excess personal property received by the agency. This 
responsibility should include compliance reviews, field inspections, 
audits, and other procedures to monitor the excess personal property 
controlled by an agency. The system of accountability for excess 
personal property should be in accordance with agency procedures, and 
records subject to audit by an internal audit group of the Federal 
agency and made available to the General Accounting Office upon request.
    (c) GSA will assist agencies in meeting their requirements for 
property of the types excepted by this part from formal reporting as 
excess. Federal agencies requiring such property should contact the 
appropriate GSA regional office indicated in Sec. 101-43.4802. GSA area 
utilization officers, stationed at key excess generating points 
throughout the United States, screen and offer nonreported personal 
property as it becomes available for transfer.
    (d) GSA regional offices will screen all requests for replenishment 
of stock and direct delivery purchase requests submitted by agencies 
against lists of excess personal property available in their regions. 
GSA may take physical custody of such excess personal property for 
redistribution or may direct its transfer to executive agencies instead 
of procurement of new property from commercial sources of supply. Notice 
of intent to substitute will be provided to the ordering agency if the 
excess personal property is used, rehabilitated, or differs in some 
substantial characteristics from the item ordered. This will give the 
ordering agency an opportunity to inspect the property before shipment. 
Acceptance of excess personal property under these circumstances shall 
be required unless the using agency submits a written justification 
stating that such transfers or substitutions would result in serious 
hardship or impairment to its operations.
    (e) Part 101-27 prescribes standards for executive agencies use in 
computing inventory levels. To encourage the use of excess property 
which might otherwise be disposed of as surplus, inventory levels may be 
adjusted upward when items of stock are to be acquired from excess 
sources. Such adjustments should be computed with caution and arrived at 
after careful analysis which gives consideration to the factors set 
forth in part 101-27 and this part. Generally, acquisitions of items for 
inventory from excess shall not exceed a 2-year supply except when:
    (1) A greater quantity is needed to meet known requirements for an 
authorized planned program.
    (2) The item is not available without special manufacture and a 
predictable requirement exists.
    (3) Administrative determination has been made that in application 
of the economic order quantity (EOQ) principle of stock replenishment 
within an agency, an inventory level in excess of 2 years is appropriate 
for low dollar-volume items.
    (4) The items are being transferred into authorized stock funds for 
resale to other Government agencies.
    (5) In addition, the following conditions should be met prior to 
acquisition of excess:
    (i) There must be a predictable requirement for an authorized 
program.
    (ii) The cost of acquisition, including packing and shipping, 
carrying in inventory, and preservation, shall not exceed delivered cost 
of new material.
    (iii) The supply acquired does not exceed the expected shelf life, 
considering condition at time of acquisition.
    (iv) The supply of spare parts acquired shall not exceed the life 
expectancy of the equipment supported.


<R05>
Sec. 101-43.303  Retention of custody.

    (a) GSA may direct the holding agency to retain custody of property 
reported to GSA for utilization, donation, or sales action pending 
disposition. The holding agency shall make

[[Page 546]]

adequate provisions for the protection of property in its custody and 
reported to GSA against the hazards of fire, theft, vandalism, and 
weather commensurate with the condition and value of the property and 
the availability of storage space.
    (b) GSA may order transfer of partial or total custody to other 
executive agencies, with their consent.
    (c) At the end of a period of 180 days from the date the property is 
made available to GSA, the holding agency may, upon proper notification 
to the appropriate regional Federal Supply Service Bureau, elect to 
assume the responsibility to complete the disposal in compliance with 
all the processing requirements of this subchapter H normally performed 
by GSA, except that property pending transfer or donation for a known 
requirement and property offered for sale in an invitation for bids will 
not be returned to holding agency control. Such property may be returned 
to holding agency control if the pending transfer or donation cannot be 
completed or the pending sales offering produces no bids.


<R05>
Sec. 101-43.304  Reporting requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 101-43.304-1  Reporting.

    (a) Excess personal property shall be reported promptly in 
accordance with the Federal supply classification (FSC) groups and 
classes in Sec. 101-43.4801 with descriptions in sufficient detail to 
permit transfer or sale without further reference to the holding agency. 
In the absence of these descriptions, adequate commercial descriptions 
shall be substituted. Exceptions to these reporting requirements are 
covered in Sec. 101-43.305. Whenever possible, the national stock number 
(NSN) shall be provided as part of the description. It is essential that 
the excess personal property report reflect the true condition of the 
property as of the date it is reported excess through assignment of the 
appropriate disposal condition code designation as defined in Sec. 101-
43.4801(e). Each Department of Defense (DoD) excess personal property 
report must also contain the appropriate supply condition code as 
defined in Sec. 101-43.4801(f), except reports of contractor inventory 
when a determination is made that inclusion of the supply condition code 
is impractical. When available from property records, civilian agencies 
shall also include the appropriate supply condition code in excess 
personal property reports. To expedite processing, reports may be 
submitted up to 60 days prior to the actual date of property 
availability, provided that the report clearly indicates this pending 
status and reflects the date on which the property will be determined 
excess.
    (b) When an item of equipment is reported as excess, any available 
operating manual, parts list, circuit or wiring diagram, maintenance 
record log, or other instructional or information publication or 
brochure pertaining to the equipment shall be reported.
    (c) If the property reported is a prefabricated movable structure 
that has been installed in a permanent manner and if the reporting 
agency requires that the site be restored at the expense of the 
transferee, donee, or purchaser, the nature and estimated cost of 
restoration shall be included.
    (d) When the property being reported is an excess strategic or 
critical material previously reported to GSA in accordance with subpart 
101-14.1 but not accepted for transfer to the national stockpile, the 
fact that the material was previously reported shall be noted.


<R05>
Sec. 101-43.304-2  Form and distribution of reports.

three copies. Reporting by ADP media shall be as specified and approved 
by GSA. Reports shall be directed to the GSA regional office for the

security, give advance notice of such situations as early as possible by 
letter to the appropriate GSA regional office. In such cases, agencies 
shall identify the installations to be discontinued, provide the 
scheduled date for the removal of personnel from the location, and 
specify the last date when the personal property will be needed. As soon 
as possible after filing advance notice, the excess personal property 
shall be reported in accordance with Sec. 101-43.304-1 to provide time 
for screening for Federal utilization and donation purposes. Seventy-
five calendar days are usually required.


<R05>
Sec. 101-43.305  Property not required to be formally reported.

    (a) Excess property which is not required to be formally reported to 
GSA under Sec. 101-43.304 is a valuable source of supply for Federal 
agencies. Regional offices and area utilization officers of GSA are 
responsible for local screening of such property, for making it 
available to Federal agencies, and for its expeditious transfer. Holding 
agencies shall cooperate with GSA representatives in making information 
available and in providing access to the nonreportable excess personal 
property. Federal agency employees shall be permitted access to holding 
installations for screening purposes upon presentation of a valid 
Federal agency employee's identification card. Holding agencies shall 
make reasonable efforts to obtain utilization among other Federal 
agencies of property not covered by GSA utilization screening processes. 
In the case of controlled substances, solicitation shall be limited to 
those agencies authorized for transfer under Sec. 101-42.1102-3 
provisions.
    (b) Unless otherwise directed by GSA, the following excess personal 
property shall not be reported:
    (1) Perishables, defined for purposes of this section as any 
foodstuffs which are subject to spoilage or decay;
    (2) Property dangerous to public health and safety (see paragraph 
(d) of this section);
    (3) Scrap and/or salvage, provided the property strictly conforms to 
the definitions for scrap and/or salvage (Secs. 101-43.001-28 and 101-
43.001-29);
    (4) Property determined by competent authority to be classified or 
otherwise sensitive for reasons of national security;
    (5) Other items excepted from the requirement to be reported as 
listed in Sec. 101-43.4801;
    (6) Otherwise reportable property which, prior to reporting as 
required in Sec. 101-43.304, is transferred directly between Federal 
agencies as provided in Sec. 101-43.309-5(a) or by prearrangement with 
GSA to fill a known need;
    (7) Trading stamps and bonus goods (see Sec. 101-25.103-4); and
    (8) Nonappropriated fund property (see Sec. 101-43.307-7).

    (c) Nuclear Regulatory Commission-controlled materials are exempt 
from reporting to GSA as excess personal property. Transfers of such 
materials shall be made under provisions under Sec. 101-42.1102-4 and 
applicable NRC regulations. (See 10 CFR parts 30, 40, and 70.)
    (d) In the case of hazardous materials, all the restrictions, 
limitations, and guidelines prescribed in part 101-42 shall apply.

Sec. 101-43.306  Assistance in emergency and major disaster relief.

    In accordance with instructions of the Administrator, Federal 
Disaster Assistance Administration, Department of Housing and Urban 
Development, or his designee, excess personal property shall be utilized 
in behalf of or loaned to State and local governments, with or without 
compensation therefor, pursuant to the Disaster Relief Act of 1974 (Pub. 
L. 93-288) and Executive Order 11795 of July 11, 1974, to provide 
assistance to State and local governments in alleviating suffering and 
damage resulting from any emergency or major disaster. Excess medicines, 
foods, and other consumable supplies may be distributed to State and 
local governments for these purposes. In the event such property has 
been reported to GSA pursuant to Sec. 101-43.304, it shall be withdrawn 
by the holding agency pursuant to Sec. 101-43.308.

or their subcontractors to retain or dispose of any contractor inventory 
pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR subpart 45.6) and 
under such orders as such agency may prescribe. In the case of 
contractor-owned contractor inventory, compliance with the utilization 
requirements and procedures in this part should ordinarily occur prior 
to the Government's exercising the applicable option to take over such 
property. When utilization efforts disclose that an agency will accept 
transfer of such property, the appropriate agency shall take the 
necessary action to acquire title for the Government.

Sec. 101-43.307-3  Conditional gifts for defense purposes.

    (a) Any agency receiving an offer of a conditional gift (other than 
money or intangible property) for a particular defense purpose within 
the purview of the Act of July 27, 1954 (50 U.S.C. 1151-1156) shall 
notify the appropriate GSA regional office and shall submit a 
recommendation as to acceptance or rejection of the gift.
    (b) Prior to such notification, the receiving agency shall 
acknowledge receipt of the offer and advise the donor of its referral to 
a GSA regional office but shall not indicate acceptance or rejection of 
the gift on behalf of the United States. A copy of the acknowledgment 
shall accompany the notification and recommendation to the regional 
office.
    (c) When the gift is determined acceptable and can be used in the 
form in which offered, it will be transferred without reimbursement to a 
Federal agency designated by GSA for use for the particular purpose for 
which it was donated.
    (d) If the gift is one which GSA determines shall be converted to 
money, the funds, after conversion, will be deposited with the Treasury 
Department for transfer to an appropriate account which will best 
effectuate the intent of the donor, as provided in Treasury Department 
Circular No. 957, dated February 24, 1955.
    (e) Such conditional gifts of property will be accepted or rejected 
on behalf of the United States or transferred to an agency by GSA only 
after consultation with the interested agencies.
    (f) GSA will advise the donor and the agencies concerned of the 
action taken with respect to acceptance or rejection of the conditional 
gift and of its final disposition.

<R05>
Sec. 101-43.307-4  Conditional gifts to reduce the public debt.

    (a) Pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3113, gifts may be made to the United 
States on the sole condition that the property be sold and the proceeds 
used to reduce the public debt. Any agency receiving an offer of a gift 
(other than money or intangible property) for such purpose shall notify 
the appropriate GSA regional office and shall submit a recommendation as 
to acceptance or rejection of the gift.
    (b) Prior to such notification, the receiving agency shall 
acknowledge receipt of the offer and advise the donor of its referral to 
GSA but shall not indicate acceptance or rejection of the gift on behalf 
of the United States. A copy of the acknowledgment shall accompany the 
notification and recommendation to the GSA regional office.
    (c) GSA will advise the donor and the agency concerned of the action 
taken with respect to acceptance or rejection of the conditional gift. 
If the gift is determined acceptable, GSA will convert it into money and 
the proceeds shall be deposited into a special account in the Department 
of the Treasury established for this purpose.


<R05>
Sec. 101-43.307-5  Unconditional gifts.

    Any unconditional gift accepted by a Federal agency, or by an 
employee or agent representing a Federal agency in an official capacity, 
shall immediately become property of the Federal Government. If the 
receiving agency has specific authority to use the property, it may then 
be used for any authorized purpose by that agency. Such property shall 
be accounted for in the same manner as personal property acquired from 
other authorized sources and shall lose its identity as an unconditional 
gift upon entry into the agency property account. When property acquired 
as an unconditional gift cannot be used or is no longer required by the 
receiving agency, it shall be reported to GSA as excess personal 
property in accordance with Sec. 101-43.304.


<R05>
Sec. 101-43.307-6  Intangible personal property.

    Excess intangible personal property shall be reported to the General

Secretary of the Treasury under section 5 of the Act of April 3, 1945 
(31 U.S.C. 324).


<R05>

    (a) Nonappropriated fund property determined to be excess may be 
made available for transfer under those provisions of this part which 
apply to nonreportable property.
    (b) Transfers of nonappropriated fund property shall be made upon 
such terms as shall be agreed upon by the owning activity and the 
receiving agency. However, an agency should not acquire such property if 
the reimbursement requested is greater than the best estimate of the 
gross proceeds if the property were to be sold on a competitive bid 
basis or the dollar value offered on a trade-in.
    (c) Federal property in the custody of a nonappropriated fund 
activity, when determined to be excess, shall be reported or otherwise 
made available to GSA in accordance with this part for transfer without 
reimbursement, except as required by Sec. 101-43.309-3.

<R05>
Sec. 101-43.307-9  Passenger motor vehicles.

    When acquiring an excess passenger motor vehicle without 
reimbursement for upgrading or replacement purposes, an agency shall 
promptly report as excess the replaced vehicle (see Sec. 101-43.304). 
The report must be submitted within 30 calendar days after delivery of 
the replacement vehicle unless the replacement vehicle is charged to the 
number of passenger motor vehicles authorized by current appropriations. 
When the replaced passenger vehicle is reported excess to GSA, the 
report shall be documented so as to identify the item control number on 
the transfer document for the replacement vehicle. Agencies having a 
temporary emergency need for passenger motor vehicles, and having 
authority to lease

[[Page 550]]

motor vehicles, shall obtain such vehicles from excess when they are not 
available from a GSA Fleet Management Center prior to leasing vehicles 
from private sources. Such temporary emergency use shall not exceed a 
period of 3 months.

Sec. 101-43.307-12  Shelf-life items.

    (a) When quantities on hand of an item of a deteriorative nature 
which has a predetermined expiration date exceed requirements for the 
period ending on the expiration date, or for the period ending on the 
extended expiration date, such quantities shall be determined excess to 
the needs of the holding agency, provided that the overages cannot be 
utilized, cross-serviced, or returned for credit. Management of such 
items prior to determination as excess shall be governed for executive 
agencies, except DoD, by subpart 101-27.2, and for DoD by appropriate 
DoD instructions.
    (b) Drugs and biologicals requiring refrigeration or deep freeze, 
medical shelf-life items held for national emergency purposes (see 
Sec. 101-43.307-13), subsistence items, and ammunition are excepted from 
the provisions of this section.
    (c) Shelf-life items which have a remaining useful life of 3 or more 
months before reaching the expiration date and are not otherwise 
utilized as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, shall be reported 
as excess in accordance with Sec. 101-43.304. However, agencies may at 
their option also report shelf-life items not required to be reported by 
Sec. 101-43.304. The report shall identify the items as shelf-life items 
by carrying the designation symbol ``SL'' and by showing the expiration 
date. If the item has an extendable-type expiration date, there also 
shall be furnished an indication as to whether the expiration date is 
the original or an extended date.
    (d) Normally, items reported in accordance with paragraph (c) of 
this section will be given a surplus release date effective 60 days 
after the receipt of the report in the appropriate GSA regional office. 
This date may be shortened or extended consistent with utilization 
objectives and with the remaining useful shelf life. GSA will publicize 
reported items to other using agencies during the period ending on the 
surplus release date.
    (e) Shelf-life items which have a remaining useful life of 3 or more 
months before reaching the expiration date but which are not reported 
shall be made available for use by other Federal agencies as provided in 
Sec. 101-43.305. Documents listing such items shall show the expiration 
date and, in the case of items with an extendable expiration date, shall 
indicate whether the expiration date is the original or an extended 
date. A surplus release date shall be established by the holding agency 
upon determination that these items are excess so as to provide a 
minimum of 21 calendar days for selection or set-aside of the items for 
Federal use. The surplus release date may be extended by the holding 
agency when these items are selected by an authorized screener for 
transfer or are set aside by a GSA representative for potential or 
actual transfer.
    (f) Shelf-life items which have a remaining useful life of less than 
3 months, regardless of acquisition cost or condition, shall be made 
available for utilization by other Federal agencies in the manner 
provided in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (g) Transfers among Federal agencies of shelf-life items which have 
been determined to be excess by the holding agency shall be accomplished 
as set forth in Sec. 101-43.309. Transfers shall be made without 
reimbursememt.

[[Page 551]]


<R05>
Sec. 101-43.307-13  Medical shelf-life items held for national emergency purposes.

    (a) Whenever the head of an executive agency determines that the 
remaining storage or shelf life of medical materials or supplies held 
for national emergency purposes is of too short duration to justify 
their continued retention of such purposes and that their transfer or 
disposal would be in the best interest of the United States, those 
materials or supplies shall be considered to be excess personal 
property. To the greatest extent practicable, the above determination 
shall be made at such time as to ensure that such medical materials or 
supplies can be transferred or otherwise disposed of in sufficient time 
to permit their use before their shelf life expires and the items are 
unfit for human use.
    (b) Medical materials and supplies held by an agency for national 
emergency purposes and determined to be excess may be exchanged with 
another Federal agency without prior approval of GSA and without regard 
to the provisions of part 101-46. Such exchanges, however, shall be only 
for other medical materials or supplies to be held for national 
emergency purposes.
    (c) Medical shelf-life items held for national emergency purposes 
which have a remaining useful life of 3 or more months before the 
expiration date and which are not otherwise exchanged as provided in 
paragraph (b) of this section shall be reported as excess in accordance 
with Sec. 101-43.304. Each agency may also report medical shelf-life 
items not required to be reported by Sec. 101-43.304. The excess report 
shall identify items as medical shelf-life items held for national 
emergency purposes by carrying the designating symbol ``MSL'' and by 
showing the shelf-life expiration date. Information shall also be 
furnished regarding whether the expiration date is the original or the 
extended date. Further, whenever medical shelf-life items held for 
national emergency purposes are reported as excess, any specialized 
storage requirements pertaining to the items listed thereon shall be 
noted on the report.
    (d) Normally, medical shelf-life items held for national emergency 
purposes and reported in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section 
will be given a surplus release date effective 60 calendar days after 
the receipt of the report in the appropriate GSA office. This date may 
be shortened or extended according to utilization objectives and the 
remaining useful shelf life. However, GSA offices will handle the 
screening of medical shelf-life items to permit their use before the 
shelf life expires and the items are unfit for human use.
    (e) Medical shelf-life items held for national emergency purposes 
which have a remaining useful life of 3 or more months and which are not 
reportable in accordance with Sec. 101-43.4801 shall be made available 
for use by other Federal agencies as provided in Sec. 101-43.305. When 
such items are determined excess, a surplus release date shall be 
established by the holding agency providing a minimum of 21 calendar 
days for selection of the items for Federal use. For controlled 
substances (as defined in Sec. 101-43.001-4), each executive agency 
shall comply with Sec. 101-43.307-2.
    (f) Transfers among Federal agencies of medical materials and 
supplies held for national emergency purposes and determined to be 
excess shall be accomplished in accordance with Sec. 101-43.309, except 
that such transfers shall be made upon such terms and prices as shall be 
agreed to by the Federal agencies concerned. Proceeds from such 
transfers may be credited to the current applicable appropriation or 
fund of the tranferring agency and shall be available only for the 
purchase of medical materials or supplies for national emergency 
purposes.

<R05>
Sec. 101-43.308-1  Withdrawals.

    Requests for withdrawal of property previously reported as excess 
shall be submitted to the GSA regional office to which the original 
report was forwarded. Withdrawal requests may be submitted on SF 120 or 
by any other method approved by GSA. Disposition of property shall not 
be made until after approval for withdrawal is received from GSA except 
in instances

[[Page 552]]

involving the physical transfer of property for purposes of major 
disaster relief.


<R05>
Sec. 101-43.308-2  Corrections.

    Corrections of reports of excess property shall be submitted on SF

regional office for necessary action.


<R05>
Sec. 101-43.309  Transfers of excess personal property.


<R05>
Sec. 101-43.309-1  Agencies eligible.

    Transfers of excess personal property may be made among Federal 
agencies (including their cost-reimbursement contractors, cooperatives, 
and project grantees), the Senate, the House of Representatives, the 
Architect of the Capitol and any activities under his direction, mixed-
ownership Government corporations as defined in 31 U.S.C. 9101, the 
municipal government of the District of Columbia, or non-Federal 
agencies for which GSA procures.


<R05>
Sec. 101-43.309-2  Information on availability.

    There are several methods of obtaining reliable information 
regarding the availability of excess personal property:
    (a) Personal contact with GSA or the holding installations;
    (b) Review of excess personal property catalogs and bulletins 
circulated by GSA;
    (c) Examination and inspection of reports and samples of excess 
personal property assembled for this purpose in GSA regional offices; 
and
    (d) Submission of current and future requirements for excess 
personal property to the appropriate GSA regional office using GSA Form 
1539, Request for Excess Personal Property, illustrated at Sec. 101-
43.4902-1539. Instructions for submission of requirements may be 
obtained from any GSA regional office. Wherever possible, the NSN should 
be included for each item requested. GSA will assist agencies in 
obtaining NSN's so that requirements may be incorporated into the 
automated matching system. if substitute items are acceptable, these 
should be furnished at the same time and identified by NSN. Requirements 
for NSN items may be submitted through ADP media. If not currently 
available as excess, property requirements identified by NSN's will be 
incorporated into GSA's automated requirements bank and will be retained 
for approximately 180 calendar days. Property reported excess during 
this time, if matched with recorded requirements, will be offered for 
immediate transfer. Normally, items for which needs are registered will 
not be offered in GSA excess property catalogs and bulletins. Agencies 
should update their lists of items at the end of each 180-calendar-day 
period to retain visibility in the requirements bank.


<R05>
Sec. 101-43.309-3  Reimbursement.

    (a) General. Transfers of excess personal property shall be without 
reimbursement (the costs specified in Sec. 101-43.310-1 are chargeable 
to the transferee agency), except when:
    (1) The property transferred was acquired with funds either not 
appropriated from the general fund of the U.S. Treasury or appropriated 
therefrom but by law reimbursable from assessment, tax, or other revenue 
or receipts, and payment is requested (it is the current policy of the 
executive branch of the Government that transfers of working capital 
fund property shall be without reimbursement);
    (2) The transferor or the transferee agency (or the organizational 
unit affected is a wholly owned or mixed-ownership Government 
corporation as defined in the Government Corporation Control Act (31 
U.S.C. 9101), is the municipal government of the District of Columbia, 
or is a non-Federal agency for which GSA procures;
    (3) The transferor or the transferee agency is the U.S. Postal 
Service (USPS);
    (4) The property is designated as exchange/sale property and is 
transferred pursuant to part 101-46;
    (5) The transferee agency is acquiring the property for use by a 
project grantee which is a public agency or is nonprofit and exempt from 
taxation under 26 U.S.C. 501; or
    (6) Reimbursement is directed by GSA.
    (b) Fair market value reimbursement. Reimbursement of the fair 
market

[[Page 553]]

value may be requested by the transferor agency when:
    (1) The property being transferred was acquired with funds not 
appropriated from the general fund of the U.S. Treasury;
    (2) The property is designated exchange/sale rather than excess;
    (3) The transferor or transferee agency is the USPS (in this case, 
reimbursement is required by Executive Order 11672);
    (4) The property being transferred is owned by a nonappropriated 
fund activity of a Federal agency; or
    (5) Authorized or required by other specific authority.
    (c) Fair value reimbursement. (1) When a transfer is determined to 
be reimbursable and paragraph (b) of this section, is not applicable, 
fair value reimbursement, as determined in paragraphs (b) (2) through 
(4) of this section, is required to be paid by the transferee.
    (2) To preclude the need of establishing the fair value to be 
reimbursed for each transfer subject to such reimbursement, fair value 
is defined to be 20 percent of the original acquisition cost of new or 
unused property in condition code 1 (condition codes are shown in 
Sec. 101-43.4801(e)) and zero percent for all other personal property
    (3) Where application of the above formula will not achieve the 
intended purpose because of special circumstances or the peculiar nature 
of the property, the holding agency may use other criteria for arriving 
at fair value if approved or directed by the appropriate GSA regional 
office.
    (4) Where circumstances warrant and the agencies concerned agree 
thereto, fair value prices higher than those arrived at by use of the 
formula may be used.
    (d) Transfer orders for property requiring reimbursement must be 
annotated with the amount of reimbursement required. Disagreements 
between agencies regarding reimbursement requirements shall be referred 
for final determination to the GSA Regional Administrator for the region 
in which the property is located.


<R05>
Sec. 101-43.309-4  Transfer for redistribution.

    Items reported as excess and determined by GSA to be suitable for 
redistribution within the Federal Government may be taken into physical 
custody by GSA or, upon notification by GSA, shall be retained by the 
holding agency for a period not to exceed 180 days. Items which are 
identical to or can be substituted for items listed in the GSA Supply 
Catalog shall be furnished to agencies through the GSA stock program at 
prices to be determined by GSA. To ensure maximum redistribution of 
items available from excess, GSA may require that all orders for such 
items be forwarded to a GSA regional office until excess stocks are 
exhausted.


<R05>
Sec. 101-43.309-5  Procedure for effecting transfers.

    (a) All transfers of excess personal property between Federal 
agencies shall be by SF 122, Transfer Order Excess Personal Property 
(see Sec. 101-43.4901-122), or any other transfer order form approved by 
GSA. Automated requisitions on approved forms may be used for excess 
personal property transfers. However, Federal agencies using automated 
requisitions shall ensure that identifying codes are controlled and 
records maintained indicating the official authorized to approve 
property transfers. Each transferee agency shall forward the original 
and three copies of the transfer order to the appropriate GSA regional 
office (see Sec. 101-43.4802) for approval. An SF 120 is not required in 
addition to SF 122 for direct transfers. Prior approval by GSA is not 
required when the property involved in the given transaction is:
    (1) Reportable under Sec. 101-43.304 but has not yet been reported 
to GSA, and its total acquistion cost does not exceed $5,000, and the 
owning agency's regulations relative to internal redistribution have 
been satisfied; or
    (2) Nonreportable under Sec. 101-43.305 and has not been reserved at 
the holding location for special screening by the appropriate GSA 
regional office, and its total acquisition cost does not exceed $25,000; 
and
    (3) The appropriate GSA regional office is furnished an information 
copy of

[[Page 554]]

each direct transfer order by the transferor agency within 10 workdays 
from receipt of the order.
    (b) In those cases where a known requirement exists for excess 
personal property which exceeds the acquisition cost limitations for 
direct transfers in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, a 
request for approval of a prearranged transfer may be made. To effect a 
prearranged transfer, the requesting Federal agency must contact the 
appropriate GSA regional office for verbal approval. In considering such 
requests, GSA may apply the approval factors listed in paragraph (e) of 
this section, if competing known requirements exist. Upon approval of 
the prearranged transfer, the requesting agency must submit an SF 122 or 
other authorized transfer order form only. An SF 120 is not required in 
those cases where the property is reportable in accordance with 
Sec. 101-43.304. Approval for the holding activity to release the 
property prior to receipt of the transfer order may also be given 
verbally at the discretion of the GSA regional office. These verbal 
approvals must be obtained from an authorized representative of the GSA 
regional office, and the requesting agency shall annotate the SF 122 
with the name of the approving GSA official and the date telephone 
approval was obtained.
    (c) The SF 122 shall be completed as shown in Sec. 101-43.4901-122. 
All transfer orders shall be executed by an accountable Federal 
official, and will not be approved by GSA unless so executed.
    (1) For wholly owned or mixed-ownership Government corporations, the 
Senate, the House of Representatives, the Architect of the Capitol and 
any activities under his direction, and the municipal government of the 
District of Columbia, transfer orders shall be executed by a responsible 
official of those organizations.
    (2) For non-Federal agencies for which GSA procures, transfer orders 
shall be executed by a responsible official of the sponsoring Federal 
agency.
    (3) For contractors and grantees, transfer orders shall be executed 
by the Federal contracting officer administering the contract or other 
responsible Federal official who is knowledgeable about the terms of the 
contract or grant.
    (4) For nonappropriated fund activities of Federal agencies, 
transfer orders shall be executed by an accountable official of the 
sponsoring Federal agency. The transfer order shall state that the 
property will be entered on the accountable records of the sponsoring 
Federal agency and shall also state that the property will be used only 
for administrative or operational use but not for resale.
    (d) When property is offered for transportation, the condition of 
the items shall be shown on the bill of lading. In order that the 
Federal Government may obtain the most economical rates for the movement 
of excess personal property in other than new condition, particular 
attention shall be given to the use of the appropriate classification 
decription as required by carriers' tariffs.
    (e) While transfers of excess personal property will normally be 
approved by GSA on a first-come-first-served basis, consideration will 
be given to such factors as national defense requirements, emergency 
needs, preclusion of new procurement, energy conservation, equitable 
distribution, transportation costs, and retention of title in the 
Government. When competing Federal claims are made for particular items 
of excess personal property, with or without payment of reimbursement, 
GSA will give preference to the Federal agency that will retain title in 
the Government. Transfer requests for the purpose of cannibalization 
will be considered, but are normally subordinate to requests for the 
complete items. The GSA regional office may defer approval of any 
transfer request until all pertinent factors are considered. When 
competing requests are received, the GSA regional office may, at its 
discretion, request supporting justification from the ordering agencies 
to assist in making the allocation determination, including evidence 
that new procurement is involved. Placement of a freeze on an item of 
excess personal property by a Federal agency does not constitute an 
absolute claim on the property. The GSA regional office is responsible 
for evaluating the above factors prior to

[[Page 555]]

approval of a transfer order for a frozen item subject to competing 
requests.
    (f) A copy of each approved or disapproved transfer order will be 
returned to the ordering agency by the GSA regional office with 
appropriate notation. Two copies of each approved order will be 
appropriately noted and transmitted by the GSA regional office to the 
holding agency for transfer action. Any billing by the holding agency 
shall be accomplished in accordance with Sec. 101-43.310.
    (g) If the transfer order does not contain complete shipping 
instructions, the transferee agency is required to transmit these to the 
holding agency within 15 calendar days after receipt of the transfer 
order by the holding activity in the case of domestic shipments, or 45 
calendar days in the case of export shipments. The holding activity will 
communicate failure to receive such shipping instructions to the GSA 
regional office which approved the transfer. If the transfer order 
indicates the property is to be picked up by the transferee agency, the 
action must be accomplished within 20 calendar days from the time such 
agency is notified by the holding activity that the shipment is ready. 
The holding activity will communicate with the GSA regional office 
concerning the failure of the transferee agency to pick up property 
within the allotted time.
    (1) Holding activities will carry out shipping instructions within 
20 calendar days from receipt or make property available for pickup 
promptly
    (2) If the holding activity is unable to ship or deliver as 
required, the ordering activity must be advised of the reason for delay 
and a new scheduled shipping or delivery date.
    (h) Whenever a transfer order covers excess personal property which 
has deteriorated materially below the reported condition, the holding 
agency shall advise the GSA regional office of its current condition. 
The GSA regional office will so advise the ordering agency. Shipment 
will not be made until the ordering agency has advised the GSA regional 
office that the existing condition is acceptable and the GSA regional 
office has so advised the holding agency.
    (i) Whenever an excess item of equipment is transferred, any 
available operating manual, parts list, circuit or wiring diagram, 
maintenance record, log, or other instructional or informational 
publication or brochure pertaining to the equipment shall accompany and 
be transferred with the item of equipment.
    (j) Use of the SF 97, Certificate of Release of a Motor Vehicle, is 
restricted to situations where title to the vehicle leaves the Federal 
Government (see subpart 101-38.7).


<R05>
Sec. 101-43.310  Costs and proceeds.


<R05>
Sec. 101-43.310-1  Cost of care and handling.

    Each holding agency shall be responsible for and bear the costs of 
performing care and handling of excess property pending disposition. 
Direct costs incurred incident to transfer shall be borne by the 
recipient if billed by the holding agency. Overhead or administrative 
costs or charges shall not be included. Only costs incurred in the 
actual packing, preparation for shipment, loading, and shipment may be 
recovered by the holding agency. Where such costs are incurred, they 
shall be reimbursed by the recipient upon appropriate billing unless the 
holding agency waives the amount involved. Billing by a holding agency 
for direct costs of less than $100 for any single shipment would appear 
to be uneconomical and should be avoided.


<R05>
Sec. 101-43.310-2  Proceeds.

    (a) The proceeds of a reimbursable transfer shall be paid to the 
transferor agency where:
    (1) The transferor agency acquired the property with funds not 
appropriated from the general fund of the Treasury;
    (2) The transferor agency is the USPS;
    (3) The transferor agency is a wholly owned or a mixed-ownership 
Government corporation as defined in the Government Corporation Control 
Act (31 U.S.C. 841);
    (4) The transferor agency is the municipal government of the 
District of Columbia;

[[Page 556]]

    (5) The transferor agency is a non-Federal agency for which GSA 
procures;
    (6) The transferor agency acquired the property with appropriated 
funds, but by law is authorized to recover the proceeds;
    (7) The property is transferred under the exchange/sale authority; 
or
    (8) The property transferred is the private property of a 
nonappropriated fund activity.
    (b) The proceeds of a reimbursable transfer shall be deposited to 
miscellaneous receipts in the U.S. Treasury by the transferee agency in 
all cases where the transferor agency acquired the property with 
appropriated funds but has no specific authority to recover the 
proceeds. A copy of the deposit action shall be furnished to the 
transferor agency.


<R05>
Sec. 101-43.311  Determination of excess as surplus.


<R05>
Sec. 101-43.311-1  Reportable property.

    Excess personal property, when reported to GSA in accordance with 
Sec. 101-43.304 and not transferred to other Federal agencies, shall 
become surplus at the close of business on the surplus release date, 
which should be evidenced on the report of excess personal property. The 
surplus release date will be established to occur 60 calendar days or 
less after receipt of the report of excess personal property in the 
appropriate GSA regional office unless the property is held for 
redistribution in accordance with Sec. 101-43.309-4. The appropriate GSA 
regional office will coordinate surplus release date extensions with the 
reporting activity to minimize impact on the utilization and disposal 
process.


<R05>
Sec. 101-43.311-2  Nonreportable property.

    (a) Property excepted from the reporting requirements of Sec. 101-
43.304 shall become surplus when it has been made available by the 
holding agency for Federal use for a minimum of 21 calendar days after 
excess determination and has not been selected for transfer to other 
Federal agencies. Holding agencies shall annotate property records in a 
manner that will indicate to authorized Federal agency representatives 
the date of the excess determination. The property will become surplus 
at the close of business on the surplus release date, which normally 
will occur 21 calendar days after the holding agency determines the 
property to be available for screening as excess unless extended by GSA. 
Authorized Federal agency representatives may request and, with the 
approval of GSA, holding agencies will grant additional time not to 
exceed 30 calendar days, unless otherwise agreed upon by the holding 
agency and the GSA regional office concerned. The release as surplus of 
property not transferred to other Federal agencies will be deferred by 
the same lengths of time.
    (b) During the screening period following the determination that the 
property is excess, no holding agency shall take for its use any 
property in its custody which has been selected by a GSA area 
utilization officer for further screening or transfer for utilization, 
except with the approval of the appropriate GSA regional office; 
provided that holding activities may withdraw such property to meet 
their essential emergency requirements without this prior approval. The 
appropriate GSA regional office shall be notified of any such actions.
    (c) This section is applicable to all nonreportable excess property 
other than perishables, dangerous property, classified property, trading 
stamps, and Nuclear Regulatory Commission-controlled materials.


<R05>
Sec. 101-43.311-3  Property not utilized.

    Property determined to be surplus as provided in Secs. 101-43.311-1 
and 101-43.311-2 shall be held available for donation program screening 
in accordance with part 101-44 before it shall be assigned for sale, 
abandonment, or destruction in accordance with part 101-45. Property 
which requires reimbursement upon transfer, when determined surplus, 
shall not be available for donation but may be disposed of as provided 
in part 101-45.


<R05>
Sec. 101-43.311-4  Hazardous materials.

    Hazardous materials shall be reported to GSA in accordance with part 
101-42.

<R05>
Sec. 101-43.312  Use of excess personal property on cost-reimbursement contracts.

    (a) Excess personal property may be used to reduce the Government's 
contract costs and shall be considered for this purpose whenever 
possible. When preparing contract documents, Federal agencies shall 
ensure that appropriate provisions are included therein to accommodate 
the furnishing of excess personal property to cost-reimbursement 
contractors, as defined in Sec. 101-43.001-6.
    (b) Excess personal property may be transferred to a Federal agency 
for use by a cost-reimbursement contractor as Government-furnished 
property, provided that the contracting agency determines the transfer 
will result in a reduction in the cost to the Government or an 
enhancement of the product or benefit of the contract. All transfer 
orders submitted to GSA for excess personal property to be furnished to 
a cost-reimbursement contractor shall list the number and expiration 
date of the contract, must certify the cost reduction or product 
enhancement, and shall be executed by an authorized official of the 
contracting agency. If less than 60 calendar days remains before 
expiration of the contract, the transfer order will not be approved by 
GSA unless the contracting agency certifies that the contract will be 
extended or renewed or other written justification is provided.
    (c) Certain Federal agencies have specific statutory authority to 
vest title to property under certain circumstances, but title to 
property furnished to a cost-reimbursement contractor normally remains 
vested in the Government. Contracts shall include adequate safeguards 
and assurances relative to use, maintenance, consumption, unauthorized 
use, and redelivery to Government custody of Government-furnished 
property.
    (d) Property furnished to cost-reimbursement contractors is subject 
to the annual reporting requirements of Sec. 101-43.4701(c).


<R05>
Sec. 101-43.313  Use of excess personal property on cooperative agreements.

    (a) Executive agencies may obtain excess personal property for the 
purpose of furnishing such property to agency cooperatives under 
cooperative agreements, as defined in Sec. 101-43.001-5, made in 
accordance with the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act of 1977 
(31 U.S.C. 6301). Excess personal property may be furnished to 
cooperatives subject to the following conditions:
    (1) Authorization for the cooperative to acquire excess property is 
contained in the cooperative agreement;
    (2) A determination is made by the sponsoring Federal agency that 
the acquisition will result in a reduction in the cost to the Government 
of the agreement or an enhancement of the product or benefit from the 
agreement;
    (3) The property will not be stockpiled by the cooperative, but will 
be placed in use within a reasonable period of time following the 
acquisition;
    (4) The time remaining on the cooperative agreement is greater than 
60 calendar days from the date a transfer order is received by GSA, 
unless the sponsoring Federal agency has certified that the cooperative 
agreement will be extended or renewed, or other justification is 
submitted; and
    (5) The transfer is approved by an authorized official of the 
sponsoring Federal agency.
    (b) The amount of excess personal property (in terms of original 
acquisition cost) transferred to a cooperative normally shall be limited 
to the dollar value of the cooperative agreement. Any higher percentage 
of excess personal property transferred to a cooperative shall be 
subject to approval by an official of the sponsoring Federal agency at 
an administrative level higher than the project officer administering 
the cooperative agreement.
    (c) Title to excess personal property furnished to a cooperative by 
an executive agency remains vested in the Government, except that 
cooperative agreements for the conduct of basic or applied scientific 
research at nonprofit institutions of higher education, or at

[[Page 558]]

nonprofit organizations whose primary purpose is the conduct of 
scientific research, normally include discretionary authority to vest in 
such institutions or organizations title to excess personal property 
furnished under the cooperative agreement on such terms and conditions 
specified in the cooperative agreement.
    (d) Executive agencies shall keep in their cooperative agreement 
recordkeeping systems: Total acquisition cost of property furnished to 
all cooperatives; original acquisition cost of each item furnished, 
identified to each recipient; and date of termination and the dollar 
value of each cooperative agreement under which excess personal property 
has been furnished.
    (e) Excess personal property furnished to a cooperative shall be 
accounted for and disposed of in accordance with the specific provisions 
of the cooperative agreement and procedures established by the 
sponsoring executive agency to govern the accountability and disposition 
of excess personal property acquired under cooperative agreements. The 
cooperative agreement shall contain adequate safeguards and assurances 
relative to use, maintenance, consumption, disposition, unauthorized 
use, and redelivery of custody to the Government of excess personal 
property furnished under the agreement.
    (f) Property furnished to a cooperative is subject to the annual 
reporting requirements of Sec. 101-43.4701(c).


<R05>
Sec. 101-43.314  Use of excess personal property on grants.

    (a) Federal agencies may obtain excess personal property for the 
purpose of furnishing such property to agency grantees only when the 
non-Federal recipient is an institution or organization which is the 
holder of a Federally sponsored project grant and is a public agency as 
defined in Sec. 101-43.001-26 or is nonprofit and exempt from taxation 
under section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.
    (b) Excess personal property is transferred between Federal agencies 
as provided in Sec. 101-43.309-4 and may be furnished to project 
grantees: Provided, authorization for the grantee to use excess property 
is contained in the grant document; a written determination is made by 
the sponsoring Federal agency that the acquisition will result in a 
reduction in the cost to the Government of the grant or an enhancement 
of the product or the benefit from the grant; the property will not be 
stockpiled by the grantee but will be placed into use within a 
reasonable period of time following acquisition as directed in writing 
by the granting agency; and the transfer is approved by an authorized 
Federal official of the granting agency. Transfers to grantees are 
further subject to the following conditions:
    (1) A Federal agency may obtain excess personal property for 
transfer to a project grantee when the sponsoring Federal agency pays an 
amount equal to 25 percent of the original acquisition cost (except for 
costs of care and handling) of the property, such funds to be deposited 
into the U.S. Treasury as miscellaneous receipts. Title to excess 
personal property so furnished shall vest in the grantee. Property 
obtained by a Federal agency from excess sources and placed in direct 
official use for a period of at least 1 year may subsequently be 
furnished to a grantee without reimbursement provided the official use 
was valid and not for the purpose of circumventing the reimbursement 
requirement. Title to excess personal property so furnished shall be 
retained by the grantor agency unless specific statutory authority 
exists to vest title in the grantee.
    (2) The provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, shall not 
apply to the following:
    (i) Excess personal property transferred under section 608 of the 
Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (22 U.S.C. 2358), when and to 
the extent that property to be transferred under that Act is not needed 
for donation under the provisions of subparts 101-44.2 and 101-44.4 as 
determined by GSA. (This restriction shall not apply to excess personal 
property transferred for development loan programs under section 608 of 
the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 which may be accomplished prior to 
donation screening.)
    (ii) Excess personal property furnished under section 203 of the 
Department of Agriculture Organic Act of 1944 (16 U.S.C. 580a) through 
the U.S. Forest

[[Page 559]]

Service in connection with cooperative State forest fire control 
programs, provided title to such property is retained in the Government.
    (iii) Excess personal property furnish by Federal agencies in 
connection with grants to Indian tribes, as defined in section 3(c) of 
the Indian Financing Act (25 U.S.C. 1452(c)) as eligible for services 
from the Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs. Title to 
this property shall remain vested in the Government unless the title is 
vested under specific statutory authority.
    (iv) Excess scientific equipment transferred pursuant to section 
11(e) of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 
U.S.C. 1870) (e)). GSA will consider items of personal property as 
scientific equipment for transfer without reimbursement to the National 
Science Foundation (NSF) for use by a project grantee when the property 
requested is within FSC groups 12 (Fire Control Equipment), 14 (Guided 
Missiles), 43 (Pumps and Compressors), 48 (Valves), 58 (Communication, 
Detection, and Coherent Radiation Equipment), 59 (Electrical and 
Electronic Equipment Components), 65 (Medical Dental, and Veterinary 
Equipment and Supplies) 66 (Instruments and Laboratory Equipment), 67 
(Photographic Equipment), 68 (Chemicals and Chemical Products), or 70 
(General Purpose Automatic Data Processing Equipment (Including 
Firmware), Software, Supplies, and Support Equipment). Excess ADPE other 
than auxiliary or accessorial items with a unit acquisition cost of 
$1,500 or more must be obtained under FIRMR part 201-33 (41 CFR part 
201-33) provisions. GSA will give consideration to transfer without 
reimbursement of items of excess property in other FSC groups when NSF 
certifies the item requested is a component of or related to piece of 
scientific equipment or is an otherwise difficult-to-acquire item needed 
for scientific research. Items of property determined by GSA to be 
common-use of general purpose property, regardless of classification, 
shall not be transferred to NSF for use by a project grantee without 
reimbursement.
    (v) Excess personal property furnished by the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture to State or county extension services or agricultural 
research cooperatives under 40 U.S.C. 483(d)(2)(E), provided that title 
to such property remains vested in the Government.
    (3) The exceptions listed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, shall 
not preclude any Federal agency from obtaining excess personal property 
and furnishing it to a project grantee of that agency under the 
provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (4) Excess property furnished as provided in paragraphs (b) (1) 
through (3) of this section shall be accounted for and disposed of in 
accordance with specific grant document provisions and procedures that 
are established by the granting agency to govern the accountability and 
disposition of personal property acquired under grant agreements.
    (c) To ensure that all excess personal property transferred to 
project grantees is for the specific purpose authorized by the grantor 
agency, all transfer orders for excess personal property to be furnished 
to project grantees shall be signed by the Federal agency accountable 
officer and shall state the purpose of the transfer, the name of the 
project grantee, the grant number, the dollar amount of reimbursement 
required (if any), and the scheduled date of grant termination. If the 
grant expires in less than 60 calendar days, the transfer order will not 
be approved unless the grantor agency certifies the grant will be 
extended or renewed, or other written justification is provided. Upon 
receipt of the property, the grantor agency shall ensure that deposits 
are made to the U.S. Treasury as required by paragraph (b)(1) of 
section.
    (d) With the exception of consumable items and within the 
limitations of Sec. 101-43.314(b)(2)(iv), Federal grantor agencies may 
make available to their project grantees excess personal property that 
is determined by the granting agency to be necessary and usable for the 
purpose of the grant. Requests for transfer of a consumable item to a 
Federal agency for use by a project grantee will be considered by GSA 
provided adequate justification accompanies such requests. For the 
purpose of this section the term ``consumble items'' means those items 
which are intended

[[Page 560]]

for one-time use and are actually consumed in that one time; e.g., 
drugs, medicines, surgical dressings, cleaning and preserving materials, 
and fuels. When a question arises regarding the consumability of an item 
of excess personal property for transfer to a project grantee, final 
determination shall rest with the appropriate GSA regional office. 
Excess personal property may be transferred to a project grantee for the 
purpose of cannibalization when the granting Federal agency accompanies 
the transfer request with a supporting statement which clearly indicates 
that disassembly of the requested item for secondary use of its 
component parts, or for repair and maintenance of a similar item, has 
greater potential benefit than utilization of the item in its existing 
form and that a clear cost savings to the Government will result, 
subject to final determination by GSA. When circumstances warrant, 
agencies may set economic quantities for orders processed or set minimum 
life expectancies for excess personal property made available to 
grantees.
    (e) To help ensure an equitable distribution of property among 
project grantees. Federal grantor agencies shall limit the amount of 
excess personal property (in terms of original acquisition cost) 
transferred to project grantee to the dollar value of the grant. Any 
higher percentage of excess personal property transferred to a project 
grantee shall be subject to approval by an official at an administrative 
level in the Federal grantor agency higher than the project officer 
administering the grant. It is expected that agencies will consider all 
factors in determining whether to approve or disapprove transfers to 
grantees of excess personal property above the dollar value of the 
grant. Pro forma approvals or disapprovals shall not be given.
    (f) Federal grantor agencies shall include the following information 
in their grants recordkeeping systems: Total original acquisition cost 
of excess property furnished for use by all project grantees; original 
acquisition cost of each excess property item furnished for use by each 
project grantee; name and address of each project grantee; date of grant 
termination; dollar value of the grant; and original acquisition cost of 
excess property furnished, expressed as a percentage of the total dollar 
value of the grant.
    (g) Each Federal grantor agency shall develop and maintain an 
effective system for the prevention or detection of situations involving 
the nonuse, improper use, or unauthorized disposal or destruction of 
excess personal property furnished to grantees, whether or not title to 
that property is vested in the grantee. Grantor agencies shall publish 
procedures which clearly delineate the obligations of grantees with 
respect to the use and consumption or return to Government custody of 
property acquired from excess sources.
    (h) Property furnished to project grantees is subject to the annual 
reporting requirements of Sec. 101-43.4701(c).


<R05>
Sec. 101-43.315  Certification of non-Federal agency screeners.

    (a) To minimize delays in screening excess personal property at 
holding activities and to make property available quickly and 
efficiently, all non-Federal agency screeners shall be subject to 
certification by Federal authority.
    (b) The sponsoring Federal agency recommending designation of a non-
Federal agency screener shall prepare a request covering each 
designation and forward it for evaluation and approval to the GSA 
regional office for the region in which the intended screener is located 
(see Sec. 101-43.4802 for regional office addresses and assigned areas). 
The request shall state the applicant's qualifications to screen excess 
personal property and shall indicate the name, number, and termination 
date of the specific contract, agreement, or grant to which the screener 
is to be assigned. Since certification is normally approved on a 
regional basis, a request for certification for interregional screening 
shall specify the additional regions for which certification is 
requested. The GSA regional office handling the request will coordinate 
as necessary with other GSA regional offices and advise the requesting 
agency of actions taken on each request.
    (c) Sponsoring Federal agencies shall include GSA Form 2946, 
Screener's Identification, with each non-Federal agency screener 
request. GSA Form 2946 must contain the typed names of

[[Page 561]]

both the screener's organization and the sponsoring Federal agency, the 
signature of the sponsoring Federal agency official, the typed name and 
signature of the proposed non-Federal agency screener, and an affixed 
passport-style photograph of the screener.
    (d) Following approval, the GSA regional office will complete the 
GSA Form 2946 and return it to the sponsoring Federal agency for 
issuance to the screener. When the request is for an applicant whose 
screening activities are confined to a single cost-reimbursement 
contract, cooperative agreement, or project grant, the expiration date 
on the GSA Form 2946 normally shall coincide with the expiration date of 
that specific project. If the organization employing the non-Federal 
agency screener is expected to have a subsequent contract, agreement, or 
grant when the current one expires, or if the applicant's screening 
activities cover more than a single project, the sponsoring Federal 
agency may request an expiration date accordingly. If the services of an 
approved non-Federal agency screener are discontinued prior to the 
expiration date, the sponsoring Federal agency shall recover the GSA 
Form 2946. Each sponsoring Federal agency shall be responsible for 
maintaining a record of the number of certified screeners operating 
under its authority and shall immediately notify the appropriate GSA 
regional office of any changes in screening assignments.
    (e) Each non-Federal agency representative of a Federal agency 
physically screening property at holding installations for the purpose 
of selecting property for transfer shall possess a GSA Form 2946 
validated by GSA as provided in this section. However, non-Federal 
personnel of eligible organizations visiting holding activities in order 
to participate in onsite screenings or for the purpose of technical 
inspection, evaluation, and/or removal of property previously set aside 
or approved by GSA for transfer shall not be required to possess a GSA 
Form 2946.
    (f) A sponsoring Federal agency may request authorization for a non-
Federal agency representative to screen excess personal property at 
specific holding installations on a one-time basis without formal 
certification. Such requests shall be submitted to the GSA regional 
office serving the area in which the holding installations are located. 
The GSA regional office shall coordinate with the holding installations 
and, if the request is approved, issue a letter authorizing the non-
Federal agency representative to screen excess personal property at the 
holding installations specified; if possible, on the dates requested.

    Source: 53 FR 16102, May 5, 1988, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 101-43.501  Federal Government policy.

    Foreign excess personal property, when determined available for 
return to the United States, together with domestic excess personal 
property is a first source of supply. To the maximum extent practicable, 
each executive agency shall fulfill its requirements for personal 
property by obtaining domestic excess personal property (see subpart 
101-43.3) or foreign excess personal property in accordance with this 
subpart in lieu of new procurement, or to enhance and further its 
program objectives.


<R05>
Sec. 101-43.502  Holding agency responsibilities.

    (a) Each executive agency having foreign excess personal property is 
responsible for its disposal as provided by title IV of the Federal 
Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended (40 U.S.C. 
511 et seq.), or by other governing statute. Before making foreign 
excess personal property available for return to the United States for 
further Federal use or for donation as prescribed in paragraph (b) of 
this section, and in subpart 101-44.3, the holding agency may make such 
property available for use in authorized Federal programs outside the 
United States.

[[Page 562]]

    (b) It is the responsibility of each holding agency, or of GSA after 
consultation with such agency, to determine whether it is in the 
interest of the United States to return foreign excess personal property 
to the United States for further Federal use or for donation. 
Determinations to return property may be made in response to specific 
requests for transfer or from consolidated screening requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 101-43.503  Payment of costs.

    (a) All direct costs involved in returning foreign excess personal 
property to the United States under this subpart which are incurred by 
and billed to GSA from the point of origin to a GSA facility in the 
United States shall be reimbursed by the transferee agency upon 
appropriate billing by GSA. Direct costs include packing, handling, 
crating, and transportating.
    (b) Transportation costs from the GSA location to the transferee 
agency shall be borne by the transferee agency. Payment of such 
transportation costs shall be made by the transferee agency to the 
transportation carrier.

Sec. 101-43.600  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart prescribes policies and procedures to be followed by 
agencies for disposing of Government-owned information technology (IT) 
equipment and software that is no longer needed for the purpose for 
which it was acquired. Information technology means any equipment or 
interconnected system or subsystem of equipment, that is used in the 
automatic acquisition, storage, manipulation, management, movement, 
control, display, switching, interchange, transmission, or reception of 
data or information by an executive agency. The term includes computers, 
ancillary equipment, software, firmware and similar procedures, services 
(including support services), and related resources.


<R05>
Sec. 101-43.601  General.

    (a) Government-owned IT equipment that is no longer needed for the 
purpose for which it was acquired is either--
    (1) Reassigned within the agency;
    (2) Declared excess to the agency's needs and made available for 
transfer to another agency;
    (3) Exchanged or sold as part of a transaction to acquire 
replacement IT equipment; or
    (4) Declared surplus and made available for donation.
    (b) IT software that is no longer needed for the purpose for which 
it was acquired is either--
    (1) Reassigned within the agency consistent with the limitations of 
any applicable license; or
    (2) Otherwise disposed of consistent with the limitations of any 
applicable license.


<R05>
Sec. 101-43.602  Policies.

    Agencies shall--
    (a) Use IT equipment or IT software that is available for 
reassignment within the agency or by transfer from another agency when 
such use is the most advantageous alternative to satisfy the agency's 
requirements.
    (b) Make available for reassignment within the agency IT equipment 
that is not outdated and that is no longer needed for the purpose for 
which it was acquired.
    (c) Make available for interagency screening and transfer to another 
agency, excess IT equipment that is not outdated and has an original 
acquisition cost (OAC) per component of $1 million or more. Outdated IT 
equipment means any IT equipment over six years old, based on the 
initial commercial installation date of that model of

[[Page 563]]

equipment, and that is no longer in current production. Interagency 
transfer of IT equipment that is not outdated with an OAC per component 
of less than $1 million, is permitted if the holding agency learns of a 
potential user outside of the screening process. Agencies may 
interagency screen and transfer excess IT equipment without GSA 
approval.
    (d) Make available for surplus donation or subsequent sale, excess 
IT equipment not exchanged, sold, reassigned or transferred.
    (e) Consistent with the limitations of any applicable license--
    (1) Make available for reassignment within the agency IT software 
that is no longer needed for the purpose for which it was acquired;
    (2) Make available for interagency transfer, excess IT software not 
exchanged or sold, if the holding agency learns of a potential user 
outside of the screening process (GSA does not require interagency 
screening of IT software);
    (3) For excess IT software not reassigned, transferred, exchanged, 
or sold, either:
    (i) Return it to the licensor, or
    (ii) Destroy it after a duly authorized agency official determines 
in writing that destruction is the most cost-effective disposal 
approach.


<R05>
Sec. 101-43.603  Procedures.

    (a) Each agency head shall designate an agency point of contact for 
managing the disposition of IT equipment and software. Each agency shall 
submit the name, address, and phone number of this individual to the 
General Services Administration/MKS, 18th & F Streets, NW., Washington, 
DC 20405. GSA will maintain a list of these coordinators on the IT 
Policy Home Page. The URL is http: //www.itpolicy.gsa.gov.
    (b) GSA will convene meetings with agency points of contacts 
periodically to discuss emerging issues relating to the disposition of 
excess IT resources.
    (c) Agencies shall--
    (1) Establish procedures for the reassignment of IT equipment and 
software within the agency; and
    (2) Obtain approval from the agency Chief Information Officer before 
reassigning outdated IT equipment.
    (d) Agencies shall offer excess IT equipment that is not outdated 
and has an OAC per component of $1 million or more to other Federal 
agencies by:
    (1) Notifying other excess IT coordinators of the availability of 
the IT equipment;
    (2) Fully and accurately describing the IT excess equipment by 
providing the following information:
    (i) Condition code as defined in 41 CFR 101-43.4801;
    (ii) Manufacturer's name;
    (iii) Equipment type and model;
    (iv) Description, including the supplier's nomenclature for the 
component;
    (v) List of elements removed from each component, if applicable;
    (vi) Description of available software, engineering drawings, 
manuals, etc; and
    (vii) Contractor-held equipment, if applicable.
    (3) Allowing agencies 15 days to assess their need for the excess IT 
equipment.
    (e) Agencies may conduct exchange/sale transactions of IT equipment 
and software not transferred to another agency without GSA approval. 
(Exchange/sale transactions for IT equipment may be initiated in 
parallel with interagency screening, but screening of exchange/sale 
transactions with an OAC per component of $1 million or more shall be 
completed prior to concluding an exchange/sale transaction.) When an 
agency determines that IT equipment will be replaced by exchanging or 
selling it, the agency shall follow the contracting policies and 
procedures in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the policies 
and procedures on exchange/sale contained in 41 CFR part 101-46. IT 
software transactions must be consistent with the limitations of any 
applicable license.
    (f) Agencies shall make available for surplus donation or subsequent 
sale, in accordance with 41 CFR parts 101-44 and 101-45, excess IT 
equipment not exchanged, sold, reassigned, or transferred.
    (g) Agencies shall apply the policies and procedures of this subpart 
101-43.6 to IT equipment used by grantees and contractors when IT 
equipment is--
    (1) Acquired by the contractor or grantee under a contract or grant 
and

[[Page 564]]

the terms vest title in the Government or the Government is obligated or 
has the option to take over title;
    (2) Furnished to the grantee or contractor by the Government 
(Transfer of excess IT equipment to agency project grantees shall be 
conducted in accordance with 41 CFR 101-43.314.); or
    (3) Operated by the grantee or contractor as part of a Government-
owned or Government-controlled facility.
    (h) Agencies may request GSA to review another agency's decision to 
transfer excess IT equipment. Requests shall be sent to the General 
Services Administration/MKS, 18th & F Streets, NW., Washington, DC 
20405.

1.........  Unused--good.........  Unused property that is usable

                                    interchangeable with new items from
                                    normal supply sources.
2.........  Unused--fair.........  Unused property that is usable
                                    without repairs, but is deteriorated
                                    or damaged to the extent that
                                    utility is somewhat impaired.
3.........  Unused--poor.........  Unused property that is usable
                                    without repairs, but is considerably
                                    deteriorated or damaged. Enough
                                    utility remains to classify the
                                    property better than salvage.
4.........  Used--good...........  Used property that is usable without
                                    repairs and most of its useful life
                                    remains.
5.........  Used--fair...........  Used property that is usable without
                                    repairs, but is somewhat worn or
                                    deteriorated and may soon require
                                    repairs.
6.........  Used--poor...........  Used property that may be used
                                    without repairs, but is considerably
                                    worn or deteriorated to the degree
                                    that remaining utility is limited or
                                    major repairs will soon be required.
7.........  Repairs required good  Required repairs are minor and should
                                    not exceed 15 percent of original
                                    acquisition cost.

[[Page 568]]

 
8.........  Repairs required--     Required repairs are considerable and
             fair.                  are estimated to range from 16
                                    percent to 40 percent of original
                                    acquisition cost.
9.........  Repairs required--     Required repairs are major because
             poor.                  property is badly damaged, worn, or
                                    deteriorated, and are estimated to
                                    range from 41 percent to 65 percent
                                    of original acquisition cost.
X.........  Salvage..............  Property has some value in excess of
                                    its basic material content, but
                                    repair or rehabilitation to use for
                                    the originally intended purpose is
                                    clearly impractical. Repair for any
                                    use would exceed 65 percent of the
                                    original acquisition cost.
S.........  Scrap................  Material that has no value except for
                                    its basic material content.

their duly accredited representatives authorized to participate in the 
donation program in locating, screening and inspecting surplus personal 
property for donation. Upon reasonable request, holding agencies shall 
make available to these agencies or their representatives complete 
information regarding the quantity, description, condition, and location 
of donable property in their inventories. Holding agencies, however, 
need not prepare nor mail reports or listings not otherwise required by

    (b) Each holding agency shall annotate nonreportable personal 
property records to indicate to authorized State agencies, donee 
representatives or responsible Federal officials the date of the surplus 
determination by the holding agency.
    (c) Pending donation, each holding agency shall be responsible for 
performing, and bearing the cost for, the care and handling of its 
property. Direct costs incurred by the holding agency in the actual 
packing, preparation for shipment, and loading of property incident to 
the donation may be reimbursable. Holding agencies may waive the amount 
involved as being uneconomical or impractical to collect. Where such 
charges are incurred, they shall be reimbursed promptly by the State 
agency or designated donee upon appropriate billing. Overhead or 
administrative costs or charges shall not be included.
    (d) Holding agencies shall provide a period of 21 calendar days 
following the surplus release data for donation

    (e) Surplus property set aside for donation (see Sec. 101-44.109) 
shall be retained by the holding agency for a period not to exceed 42 
calendar days from the surplus release date, pending receipt of an 
approved Standard Form (SF) 123, Transfer Order Surplus Personal 
Property, from GSA and firm instructions for pickup or shipment of the 
property. The transferee is responsible for removing the property or for

disposal officers or other representatives of holding activities shall 
not act as the agent or shipper for transferees in this regard. Upon 
receipt of the approved SF 123 and instructions for pickup or shipment, 
the holding activity shall promptly notify the transferee or the 
transferee's designated agent of the availability of the property. At 
the end of the 42-day period, the holding agency may proceed with the 
disposal of the property if the approved SF 123 and pickup or shipping 
instructions have not been received.
    (f) Surplus property shall not be released by a holding activity for 
donation until the activity has received an SF 123 bearing the signed 
approval of the appropriate GSA official.

disaster assistance will be made by the State receiving the property. If 
reimbursement is sought, the State agency should coordinate and make

    (v) If, during the period of restriction, the vessel is no longer 
suitable, usable, or further needed by the donee for the purpose for 
which it was acquired, the donee shall promptly notify the State agency 
and request disposal instructions. Disposal instructions shall not be 
issued by the State agency except with the prior written concurrence of 
GSA.
    (c) Donation of vessels to service educational actitities. (1) 
Donation of a surplus Department of Defense (DOD) vessel to a donee 
eligible in accordance with the provisions of subpart 101-44.4 shall be

44.108-9. The SF 123, with the donee's letter of intent and any 
additional required documentation specified, shall be submitted for 
approval to the appropriate GSA regional office.
    (2) The vessel shall be used solely in connection with the plan of 
utilization set forth in the donee's letter of intent unless DOD 
authorizes a change, in writing, to the donee's plan of utilization.
    (3) The donee shall apply to the U.S. Coast Guard at the port for 
documentation of the vessel (and shall provide the U.S. Coast Guard with 
a copy of its letter of intent) within 30 calendar days of receipt of 
the vessel and shall forward a copy of evidence of the documentation to 
DOD and GSA.

Sec. 101-44.109  Donation screening period.

    (a) A period of 21 calendar days following the surplus release date 
(see Sec. 101-43.001-32) shall be provided to set aside surplus 
reportable and nonreportable property determined to be usable and 
necessary for donation purposes in accordance with the provisions of 
subparts 101-44.2, 101-44.4, and 101-44.5. Reportable surplus property 
will be set aside for donation when an application for donation, with an 
informational copy to the holding activity, is submitted to a GSA 
regional office for approval within the donation screening period. 
Nonreportable surplus property will be set aside for donation upon 
notification to a holding activity within the donation screening period 
by a responsible Federal official, a State agency representative, or an 
authorized donee representative that the property is usable and 
necessary for donation purposes.
    (b) During the prescribed 21-day donation screening period, 
applications for surplus personal property will be processed by GSA 
regional offices in the following sequence:
    (1) Department of Defense personal property reportable to GSA in 
accordance with Sec. 101-43.304 will be reserved for public airport 
donation during the first 5 calendar days of the donation screening 
period and during the next 5 days for service educational activities. 
During the remaining portion of the donation screening period, the 
property will be available on a first-come, first-served basis to all 
applicants.
    (2) Executive agency personal property, other than personal property 
of the Department of Defense, reportable to GSA in accordance with 
Sec. 101-43.304 will be reserved for public airport donation during the 
first 5 calendar days of the donation screening period. During the 
remaining portion of the donation screening period, the property will be 
available on a first-come, first-served basis. This property is not 
available for donation to service educational activities.
    (3) All executive agency personal property not reportable to GSA 
will be made available for donation on a first-come, first-served basis. 
Service educational activities are not eligible for donation of 
nonreportable surplus personal property of executive agencies other than 
the Department of Defense.
    (c) To expedite donation, surplus property may be made available on 
a case-by-case basis for onsite screening. The GSA regional office will 
contact the holding agency not later than 15 calendar days before the 
date the onsite screening is scheduled to start so that all necessary 
arrangements can be

[[Page 582]]

coordinated and agreed upon. If time will not permit separate 
utilization and donation screening, concurrent screening may be 
scheduled with Federal, State, and donee representatives in attendance. 
Participation in donation screening sessions is limited to State agency 
employees and representatives of eligible donees designated by the State 
agency to attend such sessions. Screening sessions shall be conducted as 
follows:
    (1) The donation screening period should be limited to the specific 
dates established by the agreement for the particular location. 
Generally, a screening period of 5 workdays should be sufficient.
    (2) The property selected for the screening sessions should be set 
aside in separate areas and properly identified by the holding activity 
to facilitate screening sessions.
    (3) GSA or State agency representatives should be present during all 
screening sessions.
    (4) The State agency representatives shall prepare SF 123, Transfer 
Order Surplus Personal Property (illustrated at Sec. 101-44.4901-123), 
at the site on a daily basis for the property selected. Upon approval by 
the GSA representative, the holding activity shall release the property. 
Processing of donation documents shall be expedited to ensure that the 
property is removed at the end of each daily session to the maximum 
extent possible. Property shall not be released until the transfer is 
approved by the GSA representative, except in emergency situations as 
determined by GSA.
    (5) When onsite screening is conducted on a continuing day-to-day 
basis under procedures previously agreed to in writing by GSA, the 
holding agency, and the State agency concerned, the presence of 
authorized GSA or State agency representatives is not required. 
Arrangements may provide for processing the essential donation documents 
after the onsite screening and removal of the property.

    All transfers of surplus personal property to the State agencies for 
donation for authorized purposes to public agencies and eligible 
nonprofit tax-exempt activities, to service educational activities, and 
to public airports shall be accomplished by use of Standard Form (SF) 
123, Transfer Order for Surplus Personal Property, and SF 123-A, 
Transfer Order-Surplus Personal Property (Continuation Sheet). The 
original and five copies of SF 123 shall be forwarded to the appropriate

<R05>
Sec. 101-44.112  Approval or disapproval of transfer orders.

    (a) Surplus property shall not be released by a holding activity for 
donation until it has received an SF 123 bearing the signed approval of 
the appropriate GSA official. In approving the SF 123, GSA regional 
offices will comply with the sequence established in Sec. 101-44.109. An 
SF 123 which is not fully or properly prepared may be returned to the 
applicant or held in suspense until the required information is made 
available. In those cases in which property is specifically requested 
for the purpose of cannibalization, the following statement shall be 
included on the SF 123: ``Item(s) ______ requested for 
cannibalization.'' Cannibalization requests may be approved when it is 
clear that disassembly of the item for use of its component parts will 
provide greater potential benefit than use of the item in its existing 
form. Upon the request of a GSA regional office, the State agency (or 
the donee in the case of property donated under the provisions of 
subparts 101-44.4 or 101-44.5) shall submit any additional information 
required to support and justify a donation application. The SF 123 will 
not automatically be held to the end of the screening period, but will 
be approved and distributed as expeditiously as possible. An SF 123 
received after

[[Page 583]]

the end of the donation screening period may be approved if the property 
is still available, and the holding activity has agreed to set the 
property aside pending receipt of donation approval.
    (b) An SF 123 may be disapproved, in whole or in part, when it is 
determined that it is in the public interest to do so, when there is a 
substantive defect in the order, when the property is not surplus, or 
when a transfer of the property to a Federal agency is pending. The 
applicant and the holding activity will be informed in writing why the 
SF 123 was disapproved. When a donation transfer is disapproved because 
of a pending Federal transfer and the transfer is not completed 
subsequently, the applicant will be advised to resubmit SF 123.

Sec. 101-44.113  Rejection of property approved for transfer.

    When a State agency or donee determines prior to pickup or shipment 
that property approved for transfer cannot be utilized, it shall so 
notify, through appropriate channels, the GSA regional office which 
approved the transfer, and the property will be released by GSA for 
other disposal. The GSA regional office may advise any other State 
agency known to be interested in the property of its possible 
availability and may approve a transfer request for donation purposes 
provided the holding activity agrees to retain the property pending the 
approval.

Sec. 101-44.114  Pickup or shipment.

    (a) Surplus property requested and set aside for donation will be 
retained by the holding agency for a maximum period of 42 calendar days 
from the surplus release date, pending receipt of the approved SF 123 
and firm instructions for pickup or shipment of the property. At the end 
of this period, the holding activity may proceed with the sale or other 
authorized disposal of the property if the approved SF 123 and pickup or 
shipping instructions have not been received.
    (b) Upon receipt of the approved SF 123 and instructions for pickup 
or shipment, the holding activity shall promptly notify the transferee 
or his designated agent of the availability of the property The 
transferee or his agent shall remove the property within 15 calendar 
days from the date of notification of availability by the holding 
activity.
    (c) The transferee is responsible for removing the property or for 
making arrangements with common carriers for its shipment. Property 
disposal officers or other representatives of holding activities shall 
not act as the agent or shipper for transferees in this regard.

Sec. 101-44.115  Overages and shortages.

    (a) Overages. When a State agency, service educational activity 
(SEA), or public airport finds that it has received surplus property in 
excess of that listed on an approved SF 123, and the estimated fair 
market value or acquisition cost of the line items involved is less than 
$500, it shall annotate its receiving and inventory records to document 
the overage. The annotation must include a description of the property, 
its estimated condition, the estimated fair market value (or acquisition 
cost if known), and the name of the holding activity from which the 
property was received. If property having an estimated fair market value 
or acquisition cost of $500 or more is received, it shall be listed on 
an SF 123, and the SF 123 sent to the GSA regional office for approval. 
In the case of property received by a public airport, the SF 123 shall 
be forwarded to GSA through the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
    (b) Shortages. When it is found that line items or portions of line 
items of property approved on an SF 123 were not received, and the total 
acquisition cost of the line items involved is less than $300, the State 
agency, SEA, or public airport shall annotate its receiving and 
inventory records to document the shortage. The annotation must include 
a description of each line item of property, the acquisition cost, and 
the name of the holding activity. If the total acquisition cost is $300 
or more, a shortage report must be prepared and submitted to the GSA 
regional office for the region in which the holding activity is located. 
A copy of this report shall be sent to the holding activity.

[[Page 584]]

Shortage reports covering property approved for donation to a public 
airport should be forwarded to the GSA regional office through FAA.
    (c) Information. Overages and shortages shall be reported, where 
required, within 90 calendar days of the date of transfer. The shortage 
report, or the SF 123 in the case of overages of $500 or more, shall be 
signed by the responsible State agency or donee representative and shall 
provide the following information.
    (1) Name and address of the holding activity;
    (2) All pertinent control numbers including the holding activity 
turn-in document number, the GSA control number if property was reported 
to GSA, and the State agency or donee transfer order number; and
    (3) A description of each line item of property, whether it is a 
shortage or an overage, the condition code (estimated if an overage), 
the quantity and unit of issue, and the unit and total acquisition cost 
(estimated if an overage).

Sec. 101-44.116  Certification of screeners.

    (a) All State agency and donee representatives wishing to visit 
Federal activities for the purpose of screening and selecting surplus 
personal property for donation in accordance with subparts 101-44.2, 
101-44.4, and 101-44.5 must be authorized and certified by GSA. Requests 
for certification of donee screeners shall be submitted to GSA by the 
appropriate State agency for the purposes of subpart 101-44.2 by the 
Department of Defense (DOD) for the purposes of subpart 101-44.4, and by 
the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for the purposes of subpart 
101-44.5.
    (b) The agency recommending the designation of a donee screener 
shall prepare a request to inform GSA of the proposed designation and 
forward it for evaluation and approval to the GSA regional office 
serving the region in which the intended screener is located. (See 
Sec. 101-43.4802 for regional offices, addresses, and assigned areas.) 
The request shall state the name and address of the State agency or 
donee activity the prospective screener represents, and certify that the 
applicant is qualified to screen as an authorized representative of the 
cited organization. A list of the Federal installations the screener 
will be authorized to visit shall accompany each request. The list of 
Federal installations should be limited to those within the applicable 
State, except where there are particular reasons why State agency 
screeners or donee screeners should regularly visit installations 
outside the State. Special requests for State agency or donee screeners 
to visit installations outside the State or region on a regular or one-
time basis may be authorized by the GSA regional offices involved. The 
recommending agency shall select qualified screeners representing public 
agencies and other eligible donee organizations within the State in 
order to expedite the movement of surplus property and enhance the 
opportunities of those public agencies and organizations to identify and 
select needed and useful items of property. GSA will give special 
consideration to requests of individual donees submitted through 
recommending agencies for allocation of specific items of property.
    (c) Recommending agencies shall accompany each request for 
certification of a donee screener with GSA Form 2946, Screener's 
Identification (illustrated at Sec. 101-43.4902-2946). GSA Forms 2946 
must contain the typed names of the screener's organization and 
sponsoring agency, the signature and type name of the proposed screener, 
an affixed passport-style photograph of the screener, and the signature 
of the sponsoring agency official.
    (d) In order to avoid proliferation of screeners, the GSA regional 
office will review requests for donee screening authorizations to ensure 
that the number of screeners requested by each designated activity is 
reasonable in relationship to the scope of the donee's program and that 
the screeners are qualified to perform this service. Following review, 
the GSA regional office, if the request is approved will complete the 
GSA Form 2946 and return it to the recommending agency for issuance to 
the screener. Each GSA regional office will control the activities of 
donee screeners at Federal installations within its region. The regional 
office may

[[Page 585]]

screeners' vists or require a reduction in their number when it becomes 
evident that the volume of surplus personal property at an installation 
does not warrant the level of screening activity or that a proliferation 
of screeners is affecting adversely the installation's property disposal 
activity. All GSA Forms 2946 shall be recovered by the recommending 
agency upon expiration or termination of the screener's authorization 
and shall be forwarded to the validating GSA office for cancellation.
    (e) Each State agency or other donee representative physically 
screening property at holding installations for the purpose of selecting 
property for donation shall possess a GSA Form 2946 validated by GSA as 
provided in this Sec. 101-44.116. However, representatives visiting 
holding activities in order to participate in onsite screenings in 
accordance with Sec. 101-44.109, or for the purpose of technical 
inspection, evaluation, and/or removal of specific property previously 
set aside or approved by GSA for donation, shall not be required to 
possess a GSA Form 2946.

Sec. 101-44.117  Recovery of property for Federal use.

    Occasionally, Federal agencies may develop on an exigency basis 
requirements for personal property items derived from surplus sources in 
the possession of a State agency. The State agency should cooperate with 
GSA in the recovery of property to fulfill Federal needs. The transfer

Sec. 101-44.202  State agency plan of operation.

    Section 203(j)(4) of the act provides that State agencies shall be 
established and operated in accordance with detailed plans developed 
according to State law and conforming with provisions of the act. A 
State must have its

[[Page 586]]

plan of operation approved by the Administrator before it may have 
property transferred to it. The plan must assure that the State agency 
has the necessary organizational and operational authority and 
capability, including staff, facilities, means and methods of financing, 
and procedures with respect to: Accountability, internal and external 
audits, cooperative agreements, compliance and utilization reviews, 
equitable distribution and property disposal, determination of 
eligibility, and assistance through consultation with advisory bodies 
and public and private groups.
    (a) State action. The State plan of operation shall be developed by 
the State legislature, certified by the chief executive officer of the 
State, and submitted to the Administrator for acceptance.
    (b) General notice. In accordance with the act no plan of operation 
and no major amendment thereof shall be filed with the Administrator 
until 60 calendar days after general notice of the proposed plan has 
been published, and interested persons have been given at least 30 
calendar days during which to submit comments. In developing and 
implementing the plan the State shall take into consideration the 
relative needs and resources of all public agencies and other eligible 
institutions within the State. Assurance shall be provided in the State 
plan that such public notice and such time for public comment was 
provided prior to submission of the plan and that such consideration of 
relative needs and resources of all donees in the State was given in the 
preparation of the plan.
    (c) Specific assurances. A State plan for the establishment and 
operation of a State agency for surplus property distribution to 
eligible donees shall provide the following information and assurances. 
(A State may include in its plan other provisions not inconsistent with 
the purposes of the act and the requirements of this part 101-44):
    (1) Authority. The chief executive officer of the State shall submit 
the State plan of operation to the Administrator as follows:
    (i) The chief executive officer shall submit the plan and certify 
that the State agency is authorized thereby to acquire, warehouse, and 
distribute surplus property to all eligible donees in the State, to 
enter into cooperative agreements pursuant to the provisions of 
Sec. 101-44.206, and to undertake other actions and provide other 
assurances as are set forth in the plan of operation; and
    (ii) Copies of existing State statutes and/or executive orders 
relative to the operational authority of the State agency shall 
accompany the State plan. Where express statutory authority does not 
exist or is ambiguous, or where authority exists by virtue of executive 
order, the State plan shall include also the opinion of the State's 
Attorney General regarding the existence of such authority.
    (2) Designation of State agency. The plan shall designate a State 
agency which will be responsible for administering the plan throughout 
the State. The plan shall describe the responsibilities vested in the 
agency and shall provide details concerning the organization of the 
agency, including supervision, staffing, structure, and physical 
facilities. The plan shall also indicate the organizational status of 
the agency within the State governmental structure and the title of the 
State official who directly supervises the State agent.
    (3) Inventory control and accounting systems. The State plan shall 
require the State agency to use a management control and accounting 
system that will effectively govern the utilization, inventory control, 
accountability, and disposal of donable surplus property. The plan shall 
set forth the details of the inventory control and accounting system 
which will be used by the State agency.
    (4) Return of donated property. The State plan shall require and set 
forth procedures for donees to return donable property to the State 
agency if such property while still usable, as determined by the State 
agency, has not been placed in use for the purposes for which it was 
donated within 1 year of donation or ceases to be used by the donee for 
such purposes within 1 year of being placed in use.
    (5) Financing and service charges. The State plan shall set forth 
the means

[[Page 587]]

and methods by which the State agency will be financed. When the State 
agency is authorized to assess and collect service charges from 
participating donees to cover direct and reasonable indirect costs of 
its activities, the method of establishing the charges shall be set 
forth in the plan. The charges shall be fair and equitable and based on 
services performed by the State agency, including but not limited to 
screening, packing, crating, removal, and transportation. When the State 
agency provides minimal services in connection with the acquisition of 
property, except for document processing and other administrative 
actions, the charge levied by the State agency shall be minimal. The 
State plan shall provide for minimal charges to be assessed in such 
cases and include the bases of computation. When property is made 
available to nonprofit providers of assistance to homeless individuals, 
the State plan shall provide for this property to be distributed at a 
nominal cost for care and handling of the property. The plan of 
operation shall set forth how funds accumulated from service charges, or 
from other sources such as sales or compliance proceeds, are to be used 
for the operation of the State agency and the benefit of participating 
donees. Service charge funds may be used to cover direct and indirect 
costs of the State agency's operation, to purchase necessary equipment, 
and to maintain a reasonable working capital reserve. Such funds may be 
deposited or invested as permitted by State law, provided the plan of 
operation sets forth the types of depositories and/or investments 
contemplated. Service charge funds may be used for rehabilitating 
donable surplus property, including the purchase of replacement parts. 
Subject to State authority and the plan of operation, the State agency 
may expend service charge funds to acquire or improve office or 
distribution center facilities. When such acquisition or improvements 
are contemplated, the plan shall set forth what disposition is to be 
made of any financial assets realized upon the sale or other disposal of 
the facilities. When refunds of service charges in excess of the State 
agency's working capital reserve are to be made to participating donees, 
the plan shall so state and provide details of how such refunds are to 
be made, such as a reduction in service charges or a cash refund, 
prorated in an equitable manner.
    (6) Terms and conditions on donable property. The State plan shall 
require the State agency to impose terms, conditions, reservations, and 
restrictions on the donee in the case of any item of property having a 
unit acquisition cost of $5,000 or more and any passenger motor vehicle. 
The specific terms, conditions, reservations, and restrictions which the 
State agency requires shall be set forth in the plan. In addition, the 
State plan shall provide that the State agency may impose reasonable 
terms, conditions, reservations, and restrictions on the use of donable 
property other than items with a unit acquisition cost of $5,000 or more 
and passenger motor vehicles. Any such additional terms, conditions, 
reservations, and restrictions which the State agency elects to impose 
should be set forth in the plan. The State agency may amend, modify, or 
release such terms, conditions, reservations, or restrictions subject to 
the provisions of Sec. 101-44.208(g), provided it sets forth in the plan 
the standards by which the State agency will grant any such amendments, 
modifications or releases. The State plan also shall provide assurance 
that the State agency will impose on the donation of a surplus item or 
items, regardless of unit acquisition cost, such conditions involving 
special handling or use limitations as the Administrator may determine 
necessary because of the characteristics of the property, pursuant to 
Sec. 101-44.108.
    (7) Nonutilized donable property. The State plan shall provide that 
donable surplus property in the possession of the State agency which 
cannot be utilized by donees in the State shall be disposed of:
    (i) Subject to the disapproval of the Administrator within 30 days 
after notice to him, through transfer by the State agency to another 
State agency or through abandonment or destruction where the property 
has no commercial value or the estimated cost of its continued care and 
handling would exceed the estimated proceeds from

[[Page 588]]

sale (Transfers of nonutilized donable property and destruction or 
abandonment shall be accomplished by the State agency in accordance with 
the provisions of Sec. 101-44.205); or
    (ii) Otherwise, under such terms and conditions and in such a manner 
as may be prescribed by the Administrator pursuant to the provisions of 
Sec. 101-44.205.
    (8) Fair and equitable distribution. The State agency is responsible 
for the fair and equitable distribution of surplus personal property 
through donation to all eligible donees in the State. The State plan 
shall provide for distribution based on the relative needs and resources 
of public agencies and other eligible institutions and their abilities 
to utilize the property. The State plan shall set forth the policies and 
detailed procedures for effecting a prompt, fair, and equitable 
distribution. The State plan shall also require that the State agency, 
insofar as practicable, select property requested by a public agency or 
other eligible institution and, when so requested by the recipient, 
arrange for shipment of the property direct to the recipient.
    (9) Eligibility. The State plan shall set forth procedures for the 
State agency to determine the eligibility of applicants for the donation 
of surplus personal property. Standard and guidelines for the 
determination of eligibility are provided in Sec. 101-44.207.
    (10) Compliance and utilization. The State agency shall effect 
utilization reviews for compliance by donees with the terms, conditions, 
reservations, and restrictions imposed by the State agency for any item 
of property having a unit acquisition cost of $5,000 or more and any 
passenger motor vehicle. Such reviews also shall include a review of 
compliance by the donees with any special handling conditions or use 
limitations imposed on items of property by the Administrator, pursuant 
to Sec. 101-44.108. The State plan shall set forth the provisions for 
and the proposed frequency of such reviews and shall provide adequate 
assurances that effective action shall be taken by the State agency to 
correct noncompliance or otherwise enforce such terms, conditions, 
reservations, and restrictions. Reports on utilization reviews and 
compliance actions shall be prepared by the State agency. The State plan 
shall provide adequate assurance that the State agency shall initiate 
appropriate investigations of alleged fraud in the acquisition of 
donated property or misuse of such property. The State agency shall 
immediately notify the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and GSA of 
any case involving alleged fraud. Further, GSA shall be advised of any 
misuse of donated property. The State agency shall assist GSA or other 
responsible Federal or State agencies in investigating such cases upon 
request.
    (11) Consultation with advisory bodies and public and private 
groups. The State plan shall provide for consultation by the State 
agency with advisory bodies and public and private groups which can 
assist the State agency in determining the relative needs and resources 
of donees, the proposed utilization of donable property by eligible 
donees, and how distribution of donable property can be effected to fill 
existing needs of donees. Details of how the State agency will 
accomplish such consultation shall be set forth in the plan.
    (12) Audit. The State plan shall provide for periodic internal 
audits of the operations and financial affairs of the State agency and 
compliance with the external audit requirements of Office of Management 
and Budget Circular No. A-128 ``Audits of State and Local Governments.'' 
The State agency must provide the appropriate GSA regional office with 
two copies of any audit report made pursuant to the Circular, or with 
copies of those sections that pertain to the Federal donation program. 
An outline of the corrective actions which the State agency will take to 
comply with any exceptions or violations indicated by the audit, and the 
scheduled completion dates for these actions, must be submitted with the 
audit report. Periodically, GSA representatives may visit the State 
agency to coordinate program activities and review the State agency 
operations. GSA may, for appropriate reasons, conduct its own audit of 
the State agency following due notice to the chief executive officer of 
the State of the reasons for such audit. Financial records and all other 
books and records

[[Page 589]]

of the State agency shall be made available for inspection by 
representatives of GSA, the General Accounting Office, or other 
authorized Federal activities.
    (13) Cooperative agreements. Section 203(n) of the act authorizes 
the Administrator (or the head of any Federal agency designated by him) 
to enter into cooperative agreements with State surplus property 
distribution agencies. The provisions of section 203(n) and the 
implementing regulations are set forth in Sec. 101-44.206. A State 
agency desiring to enter into such cooperative agreements or to renew or 
revise existing agreements shall affirm its intentions in the State plan 
and cite the authority called for in Sec. 101-44.202(c)(1).
    (14) Liquidation. The State plan shall provide for the submission of 
a liquidation plan to the Administrator when a determination is made to 
liquidate the State agency. The liquidation plan shall be submitted 
before the actual termination of the State agency activities and shall 
include:
    (i) Reasons for the liquidation;
    (ii) A schedule for liquidating the agency and the estimated date of 
termination;
    (iii) Method of disposing of surplus property on hand, consistent 
with the provisions of Sec. 101-44.205;
    (iv) Method of disposing of the agency's physical and financial 
assets;
    (v) Retention of all available books and records of the State agency 
for a 2-year period following liquidation; and
    (vi) Designation of another governmental entity to serve as the 
agency's successor in function until continuing obligations on property 
donated prior to the closing of the agency are fulfilled.
    (15) Forms. Copies of distribution documents used by the State 
agency shall be included in the State plan.
    (16) Records. The State plan shall provide for the retention of 
official records of the State agency for a period of not less than 3 
years, provided that in cases involving property subject to restrictions 
for more than 2 years, records shall be kept 1 year beyond the specified 
period of restriction. In cases in which property is in compliance 
status at the end of the period of restriction, the State plan shall 
provide for the retention of the records for at least 1 year after the 
case is closed.
    (d) Implementation. (1) A State plan of operation developed by the 
State legislature and certified by the chief executive officer of the 
State shall be in effect and binding upon the State beginning with the 
date that the Administrator notifies the chief executive officer of the 
State that the plan conforms to the provisions of section 203(j)(4) of 
the act and the requirements of this part 101-44 and that allocation and 
transfer of donable surplus property to the State agency will commence. 
Such plan of operation shall remain in effect until such time as the 
Administrator may accept revisions.
    (2) GSA may, from time to time, propose modifications or amendments 
to the provisions of this part 101-44. In such cases, reasonable 
opportunity will, insofar as practicable, be afforded the State agencies 
to conform to any such regulatory changes affecting their operations.
    (e) Nonconformance. When the Administrator determines that a State 
plan does not conform to the requirements of the act or the provisions 
of this part 101-44, or subsequently that the State agency does not 
operate in accordance with the provisions of the plan, allocation and 
transfer of surplus donable property may be withheld until the 
nonconformance is corrected.

States:
    (a) Need and usability of property as reflected in selections of 
property by a State agency, including expressions of need and interest

    (g) Equitable distribution based on the existing condition as well 
as the original acquisition cost of the property available for donation.
    (h) Equitable distribution based on the ratio of population and per 
capita income of each State.


<R05>
Sec. 101-44.204  Certification and agreement by a State agency.

    (a) Certification. A State agency, in making a request to GSA for 
the transfer of donable surplus personal property, shall certify that:
    (1) It is the agency of the State designated under State law, and as 
such has legal authority within the meaning of section 203(j) of the act 
and GSA regulations, to receive surplus property for distribution within

regulation;
    (2) The property is usable and needed by a public agency for one or 
more public purposes, such as conservation, economic development,

and GSA regulations, and that the property is usable and needed by the 
donee.
    (b) Agreement. With respect to donable property picked up by or 
shipped to a State agency, the State agency shall agree to the 
following;
    (1) The right to possession only is granted and the State agency 
will make prompt statewide distribution of the same, on a fair and 
equitable basis, to donees eligible to acquire property under section

established by the State agency and/or GSA.
    (2) Title to the property shall remain in the United States of 
America although the State shall have taken possession thereof. 
Conditional title to the property shall pass to the eligible donee when

representative the applicant State agency is acting.
[42 FR 56003, Oct. 20, 1977, as amended at 45 FR 56809, Aug. 26, 1980; 
53 FR 16114, May 5, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 101-44.205  Property in the possession of a State agency.

    (a) Status. Title to all donable property located in a State agency 
distribution center is vested in the United States of America. The right 
to possession only is granted to the State agency. The State agency may 
disassemble or cannibalize an item of donable property in its possession 
when it determines that the usable parts and components thereof have 
greater donation potential than that for which the complete item was 
originally manufactured. The State agency may retain and use surplus 
personal property in its possession for the purpose of performing its 
functions pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 101-44.206.
    (b) Protection. During the time title remains in the United States 
of America the State agency shall:
    (1) Be responsible as a bailee for mutual benefit for surplus 
personal property transferred to it by GSA from the time it is released 
to the State or to the transportation agent designated by the State, and 
in the event of any loss of or damage to any or all of the property, the 
State agency shall promptly notify GSA and file a claim and/or institute 
and prosecute to conclusion the proceedings that are necessary to 
recover, for the account of the United States of America, the fair 
market value of any property lost or damaged, less the cost of care and 
handling incurred by the State agency in acquiring the property;
    (2) Maintain adequate provision for protecting property in its 
custody including protection against the hazards of fire, theft, 
vadalism, and weather; and
    (3) Promptly notify appropriate law officials including the FBI and 
GSA of any damage to or loss of property in its custody due to theft, 
vandalism, arson, or other unusual circumstances and shall provide full 
information concerning the circumstances. GSA shall be informed of any 
other types of damages to or loss of property which is in the possession 
of the State agency.
    (c) Insurance. It is GSA policy not to require a State agency to 
carry insurance as a condition for acquiring Federal surplus personal 
property for distribution to eligible recipients. However, when a State 
agency carries insurance against damage to or loss of property due to 
fire or other hazards and when loss of or damage to Federal surplus 
personal property occurs, GSA, on behalf of the United States of 
America, will be entitled to reimbursement from the State agency of the 
fair market value of the damaged or destroyed Federal property payable 
from the insurance proceeds, less the State agency's actual cost of 
acquiring and rehabilitating the property prior to its damage or 
destruction.
    (d) Distribution. Surplus personal property in the custody of a 
State agency shall be distributed promptly to eligible donees within the 
State.
    (e) Direct shipment. In order to reduce inventory, warehousing, and 
transportation costs and to ensure prompt utilization of donable surplus 
property, the State agency shall, insofar as practicable, when requested 
by the designated donee, arrange for or provide shipment of the property 
from the Federal holding agency direct to the recipient.
    (f) Transfer between States. When a State agency determines that 
surplus

[[Page 592]]

personal property in its possession cannot be utilized by eligible 
recipients within the State, its shall offer the property for transfer 
to surplus property agencies in other States. GSA encourages prompt 
transfer of property between the States. A State agency may arrange for 
visits to its distribution facilities by representatives of other State 
surplus property agencies to inspect and select unneeded property 
available for transfer. GSA regional offices, upon request, will assist 
in making known to other States unneeded property in one State which is 
available for transfer and in arranging and coordinating visits between 
State agencies. Transfers of property between States will be 
accomplished by processing SF 123, Transfer Order Surplus Personal 
Property, submitted by the requesting State through the GSA regional 
office for the releasing State. Transfers of unneeded surplus property 
between State agencies are subject to the disapproval of the 
Administrator within 30 days after notice to him.
    (g) Reporting unneeded property. A State agency at any time may 
report unneeded usable property in its possession which is not required 
for transfer to another State in the GSA regional office for 
redistribution or disposal. In reporting property to GSA, the State 
agency shall:
    (1) Provide the best possible description of each line item of 
property and its current condition code, quantity, and unit total 
acquisition cost;
    (2) Identify the date of receipt by the State agency of each line 
item of property listed;
    (3) Indicate those items which the State agency believes may be of 
interest to Federal agencies; and
    (4) Provide certification of reimbursement claimed for each line 
item.
    (h) Reutilization. Based on the information provided by the State 
agency, the GSA regional office may offer available property for 
recovery by Federal agencies. Any transfer order for that property will 
be approved by GSA and forwarded to the releasing State agency for 
appropriate action.
    (i) Disposal. Sale of undistributed property in the possession of a 
State agency will be initiated by the GSA regional office in accordance 
with the provisions of part 101-45. The GSA regional office will inform 
the State agency of the items to be sold and will work closely with the 
State agency in the preparation and prompt completion of the sale. 
Property available for sale may be turned in by a State agency to a GSA 
property or sales center with the approval of the GSA regional office 
which operates the center.
    (j) Reimbursement. Reimbursement for costs of care and handling to a 
State agency with respect to the transfer or disposal of donable 
property in its possession will be authorized by GSA as follows:
    (1) When a State agency acquires donable property by transfer from 
another State agency, reimbursement of costs incurred by the releasing 
State agency in acquiring the property, including packing, handling, and 
transportation costs, shall be established by mutual agreement between 
the two State agencies.
    (2) When a Federal activity requests property from a State agency, 
costs incurred by the State agency in acquiring the property, including 
packing, handling, and transportation costs, shall be reimbursable at 
the time the property is transferred to the Federal activity. The SF 122 
used in effecting the transfer must show the amount of reimbursement 
claimed by the releasing State agency.
    (3) When donable property in the possession of a State agency is 
required for disaster assistance, reimbursement to the State agency will 
be governed by the provisions of Sec. 101-44.105.
    (4) When disposing of undistributed property in the possession of a 
State agency by public sale, GSA may authorize reimbursement to the 
State agency for expenses related to care and handling incurred by the 
State agency in acquiring the property from within or outside the United 
States. Certification by the State agency of costs incurred is required 
and must be supported by documentation if requested by GSA. 
Reimbursement must not exceed the proceeds from the sale of the 
property. No reimbursement may be made to the State agency for actions 
subsequent to the receipt of property by the State agency from any 
source,

[[Page 593]]

including unloading, moving, repairing, preserving, or storing. 
Reimbursement will not be authorized by GSA for property acquired from 
any source if the property has been in the possession of the State 
agency for a period of 2 years from the date it was received by the 
State agency until the date it was reported to GSA for disposal. Costs 
of transporting property to a location outside a State agency 
distribution facility are not reimbursable unless transportation was 
specifically required by GSA. The sale of property at a location outside 
the State distribution facility, however, does not preclude authorized 
reimbursement to the State agency. Reimbursement is limited to:
    (i) Direct costs incurred by the Federal holding agency and billed 
to and paid by the State agency, including but not limited to packing, 
preparation for shipment, and loading; and
    (ii) Transportation costs paid or otherwise incurred by the State 
agency and not reimbursed by a donee to the State agency for initially 
moving the property from the Federal holding agency to the State agency 
distribution facility or other point of receipt designated by the State 
agency.
    (k) Abandonment or destruction. When a GSA regional office finds 
that a State agency has property in its possession that is unusable, the 
State agency may be instructed to proceed promptly with the abandonment 
or destruction of such property in accordance with the findings and the 
processes prescribed in subpart 101-45.9.

<R05>
Sec. 101-44.206  Cooperative agreements.

    This section provides policies and procedures for the establishment 
of cooperative agreements between GSA (or the head of any Federal agency 
designated by the Administrator of General Services) and a State agency 
for the use of property, facilities, personnel, and services, with or 
without payment or reimbursement and under the provisions of a 
cooperative agreement, for the use by the State agency of any surplus 
personal property in its possession subject to conditions imposed by the 
Administrator.
    (a) Authority. Section 203(n) of the Federal Property and 
Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended, provides that the 
Administrator (or the head of any Federal agency designated by him), for 
the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of section 203(j) of 
the act, is authorized to enter into cooperative agreements with State 
surplus property distribution agencies designated in conformity with 
that section.
    (b) Use of property, facilities, personnel, and services. (1) GSA 
may enter into a cooperative agreement with a State agency to furnish to 
the State agency available property, facilities, personnel, or services 
of GSA that are found by GSA and the State agency to be necessary and 
useful in assisting the State agency to distribute and use surplus 
donable personel property and otherwise to carry out the purposes of the 
act. Assistance may include furnishing Federal Telecommunications System 
(FTS) service on a reimbursable basis. It may also include furnishing 
available office space and related support such as office furniture and 
typewriters in GSA regional offices, property centers, or field offices 
to State agency screeners or administrative clerical employees to assist 
them in screening and processing donable property for donation. 
Assistance will be provided by GSA, to the extent possible, without 
reimbursement; however, any extraordinary costs incurred by GSA in 
providing assistance shall be on a reimbursable basis.
    (2) GSA may enter into a cooperative agreement with a State agency 
for the purpose of the State agency furnishing available property, 
facilities, personnel, or services that are found by GSA and the State 
agency to be necessary and useful in assisting GSA to screen, transfer, 
and allocate surplus donable personal property and otherwise to carry 
out the purposes of the act. The provision of property, facilities, 
personnel, or services may be with or without payment or reimbursement 
to the State agency.
    (3) When a Federal agency designated by GSA wishes to enter into a 
cooperative agreement with a State agency (or a State agency with a 
Federal agency) for the provision of property, facilities,

[[Page 594]]

personnel, or services to carry into effect the donation provisions of 
the act, and the Federal agency and the State agency are mutually 
agreeable to an arrangement, GSA may concur in the establishment of a 
cooperative agreement and assist in its development. Payment or 
reimbursement shall be a matter for resolution between the Federal 
agency and the State agency.
    (c) Use of surplus property by a State agency. A State agency may 
enter into a cooperative agreement with GSA providing for the retention 
by the State agency of items of surplus personal property transferred to 
it for distribution that are needed for the State agency in performing 
its donation functions. The State agency shall submit a listing of 
needed property from time to time to the appropriate GSA regional 
office. GSA will review the list to ensure that it is of the type and 
quantity of property which is reasonably needed and useful to the State 
agency in performing its function. Unless GSA disapproves the retention 
of the property within 30 days of receipt of the listing, title to the 
property shall vest in the State agency. Separate records shall be 
maintained by the State agency for the property.
    (d) Interstate cooperative distribution agreements. GSA may concur 
in a cooperative agreement between two States which have contiguous 
boundaries whereby one State agency agrees to disbribute donable surplus 
property to certain specified donees in the adjoining State. Agreements 
may be considered when the donees, because of their geographic proximity 
to the property distribution centers of the adjoining State, could be 
more efficiently and economically serviced than by their own State 
surplus property facilities. The payment or reimbursement of service 
charges by the donee shall be a matter for the mutual agreement between 
the State agencies. By entering into an interstate cooperative 
distribution agreement, the State agreeing to service donees in an 
adjoining State shall agree, as agent for the adjoining State agency, 
to:
    (1) Make certifications and agreements required by Sec. 101-44.204; 
and
    (2) Require the donee to execute the distribution of documents of 
the State agency in which the donee is located. Copies of distribution 
documents shall be forwarded to the adjoining State agency.
    (e) Termination of agreements. Cooperative agreements entered into 
between GSA and a State agency may be terminated by either party upon 60 
days written notice to the other party. Termination of an agreement 
between a Federal agency designated by GSA and a State agency, and 
interstate cooperative distribution agreements, shall be as mutually 
agreed to by the parties.

Sec. 101-44.207  Eligibility.

    This section sets forth the standards, guidelines, and procedures 
for determination of eligibility for public agencies and eligible 
nonprofit tax-exempt activities in each State to participate in the 
surplus personal property donation program, to receive surplus property 
through a State agency, and to use this property for the purposes 
authorized by the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 
1949, as amended, and by section 213 of the Older Americans Act of 1965, 
as amended (42 U.S.C. 3020d).
    (a) Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following 
terms shall have the meanings set forth in this section:
    (1) Accredited means approval by a recognized accrediting board or 
association on a regional, State, or national level, such as a State 
board of education or health; the American Hospital Association; a 
regional or national accrediting association for universities, colleges, 
or secondary schools; or another recognized accrediting association.
    (2) Approved means recognition and approval by the State department

or instructional standards established by the appropriate authority. An 
educational institution or program may be considered

[[Page 595]]

approved if its instruction and credits therefor are accepted by three 
accredited or State-approved institutions, or if it meets the academic 
or instructional standards prescribed for public schools in the State; 
i.e., the organizational entity or program is devoted primarily to 
approved academic, vocational (including technical or occupational), or

authority. A health institution or program may be considered as approved 
when a State body having authority under law to establish standards and 
requirements for public health institutions renders approval thereto 
whether by accreditation procedures or by licensing or such other method 
prescribed by State law. In the absence of an official State approving 
authority for a public health institution or program or educational 
institution or program, the awarding of research grants to the 
institution or organization by a recognized authority such as the

by similar national advisory council or organization may constitute 
approval of the institution or program provided all other criteria are 
met.
    (3) Child care center means a public or nonprofit facility where 
educational, social, health, and nutritional services are provided to 
children through age 14 or as prescribed by State law, and which is

credits leading to a baccalaureate of higher degree.
    (6) Conservation means a program or programs carried out or promoted 
by a public agency for public purposes involving directly or indirectly 
the protection, maintenance, development, and restoration of the natural 
resources of a given political area. These resources include but are not 
limited to the air; land; forests; water; rivers; streams; lakes and 
ponds; minerals; and animals, fish and other wildlife.
    (7) Economic development means a program or programs carried out or 
promoted by a public agency for public purposes which involve directly

operated shelter designed to provide temporary living accommodations 
(including welfare hotels, congregate shelters, and transitional housing 
for the mentally ill); (ii) an institution that provides a temporary 
residence for individuals intended to be institutionalized; or (iii) a 
public or private place not designed for, or ordinarily used as, a

regulation, the term does not include any individual imprisoned or 
otherwise detained pursuant to an Act of the Congress or a State law.
    (13) Hospital means an approved or accredited public or nonprofit 
institution providing public health services primarily for inpatient 
medical or surgical care of the sick and injured and includes related

services free to all residents of a community, district, State, or 
region.
    (14.1) Licensed means recognition and approval by the appropriate 
State or local authority approving institutions or programs in 
specialized areas. Licensing generally relates to established minimum 
public standards of safety, sanitation, staffing, and equipment as they 
relate to the construction, maintenance, and operation of a health or 
educational facility, rather than to the academic, instructional, or 
medical standards for these institutions. Licensing may be required for 
educational or public health programs such as occupational training, 
physical or mental health rehabilitation services, or nursing care. 
Licenses frequently must be renewed at periodic intervals.
    (15) Medical institution means an approved, accredited, or licensed 
public or nonprofit institution, facility, entity, or organization the 
primary function of which is the furnishing of public health and medical 
services to the public at large or promoting public health through the

demonstrations related to cause, prevention, and methods of diagnosis 
and treatment of diseases and injuries. The term includes but is not 
limited to hospitals, clinics, alcohol and drug abuse treatment centers, 
public health or treatment centers, research and health centers, 
geriatric centers, laboratories, medical schools, dental schools, 
nursing schools, and similar institutions. The term does not include 
institutions primarily engaged in domiciliary care although a separate 
medical facility within such a domiciliary institution may qualify as a 
``medical institution.''
    (16) Museum means a public or private nonprofit institution which is 
organized on a permanent basis essentially for educational or esthetic 
purposes and which, using a professional staff, owns or uses tangible 
objects, whether animate or inanimate; cares for these objects; and 
exhibits them to the public on a regular basis either free or at a 
nominal charge. As used in this section, the term ``museum'' includes, 
but is not limited to, the following institutions if they satisfy all 
other provisions of this section: Aquariums and zoological parks; 
botanical gardens and arboretums; museums relating to art, history, 
natural history, science, and technology; and planetariums. For the 
purposes of this section, an institution uses a professional staff if it 
employs full time at least one qualified staff member who devotes his or 
her time primarily to the acquisition, care, or public exhibition of 
objects owned or

[[Page 597]]

used by the institution. This definition of museum does not include any 
institution which exhibits objects to the public if the display or use 
of the objects is only incidential to the primary function of the 
institution. For example, an institution which is engaged primarily in 
the sale of antiques, objets d'art, or other artifacts and which 
incidentally provides displays to the public of animate or inanimate 
objects, either free or at a nominal charge, does not qualify as a 
museum.
    (17) Nonprofit tax-exempt activity means an institution or 
organization, no part of the net earnings of which inures or may 
lawfully inure to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual, 
and which has been held to be tax-exempt under the provisions of section

    (18) Park and recreation means a program or programs carried out or 
promoted by a public agency for public purposes which involve directly

nature facilities, and nature trails.
    (18.1) Provider of assistance to homeless individuals means a public 
agency or a nonprofit, tax-exempt institution or organization that 
operates a program which provides assistance such as food, shelter, or 
other services to homeless individuals, as defined in paragraph 
(a)(12.1) of this section. Property acquired through the donation 
program by such institutions or organizations must be used primarily for 
the program(s) operated to assist homeless individuals.
    (19) Public health means a program or programs to promote, maintain, 
and conserve the public's health by providing health services to 
individuals and/or by conducting research, investigations, examinations, 
training, and demonstrations. Public health services may include but are 
not limited to the control of communicable diseases, immunization, 
maternal and child health programs, sanitary engineering, sewage

recreation, public health, and public safety.
    (23) School (except schools for the mentally retarded and schools 
for the physically handicapped) means a public or nonprofit approved or 
accredited organizational entity devoted primarily to approved academic,

mentally retarded, have a staff of qualified instructors, and 
demonstrate that the facility meets the health and safety standards of 
the State or local governmental body.
    (25) School for the physically handicapped means a school organized 
primarily to provide specialized instruction to students whose physical

Social Security Act, or under titles VIII and X of the Economic 
Opportunity Act of 1964 and the Community Services Block Grant Act.
    (b) Eligibility of public agencies--(1) Public agency. Surplus 
personal property may be donated through the State agency to any public 
agency in the State. A public agency, as defined in Sec. 101-44.001-10, 
includes any:
    (i) State or department, agency, or instrumentality thereof;
    (ii) Political subdivision of the State, including any unit of local 
government or economic development district, or any department, agency, 
or instrumentality thereof;
    (iii) Instrumentality created by compact or other agreement between 
States or political subdivisions;
    (iv) Multijurisdictional sub-State districts established by or 
pursuant to State law; and
    (v) Indian tribe, band, pueblo, or community located on a State 
reservation.
    (2) Public purpose. Surplus personal property acquired through the 
State agency must be used by the public agency to carry out or to 
promote for the residents of a given political area one or more public 
purposes. While the act lists certain specific public purposes such as 
conservation, economic development, education, parks and recreation, 
public health, and public safety, this enumeration is not exclusive and 
is not intended to preclude the acquisition of donable surplus personal 
property by a public agency for other public purposes. In effecting fair 
and equitable distribution of property, based on the relative needs and 
resources of interested public agencies and other authorized donees and 
their ability to use the property, it is intended that the State agency 
give full and fair consideration to the requirements of public agencies 
for property necessary and usable for conservation, economic 
development, education, parks and recreation, public health and public 
safety, and other public purposes. Each public program is conducted by 
designated departments, agencies, or other instrumentalities of the 
State and/or local governments in carrying out either specific or 
diverse functions, with, in some cases, overlapping jurisdiction. 
Activities and functions involved in designated public programs may 
include but are not limited to the following:
    (i) Conservation. State and local agencies and districts may be 
involved mutually in carrying out programs to conserve natural 
resources. Indian tribes or communities located on a State reservation 
may also be involved in conservation projects as well as other public 
programs such as economic development.
    (ii) Economic development. Programs designed to develop the economy 
by establishing or expanding industry, commerce, or agriculture in a 
given geographic area and may include the economic development districts 
and other activities of public agencies involved in

[[Page 599]]

activities such as municipal water and sewage departments operating 
sewage systems and waste treatment plants; State or local street or 
highway departments involved in construction or improvement of roads; 
port authorities and public airport commissions involved in harbor and 
public airport development; public transit authorities providing public 
transportation; environmental and antipollution programs of municipal, 
county, or State agencies; and State and local agencies involved in 
tourism development.
    (iii) Education. Public schools, colleges, and universities are 
directly involved in the educational process. Special schools for the 
physically handicapped or the mentally retarded, as well as vocational 
and trade schools and educational radio and television stations, are 
among the educational institutions which directly contribute to the 
educational development of a district, town, city, county, or other 
governmental jurisdiction. Child care centers not only provide education 
benefits but also may promote economic development and public safety. 
Central administrative and service facilities of public school systems 
are equally necessary to successfully carry out and improve public 
education. Public libraries and museums also provide an essential 
educational and cultural service to a community.
    (iv) Park and recreation. Agencies of the State, counties, cities, 
and other instrumentalities of local government are directly involved in 
the acquisition, development, improvement, and maintenance of public 
parks and other recreational facilities which benefit the general 
public. Public parks, playgrounds, swimming pools, and golf courses are 
some of the many public facilities which not only provide recreational 
benefits but also promote economic development, conservation, and public 
health.
    (v) Public health. Public health services are directly provided by 
hospitals, clinics, health centers, and other designated medical 
institutions. Public agencies also provide broad public health benefits 
with regard to activities such as the control of communicable diseases, 
immunization, public health nursing, maternal and child health programs, 
classes in health education and nutrition, and other health programs. 
These activities may be carried on in a clinic or subsidiary center in a 
community, in a person's home, in a school, or in a private business 
office of plant. Other vital programs carried on by State, county, or 
local health departments or other designated agencies directly protect 
public health and safety as well as promote economic development. These 
programs may include inspection of meat, food, and water; control and 
elimination of disease-carrying animals or insects by fogging, spraying, 
or other methods; water purification and water distribution systems; 
sewage treatment and disposal systems; garbage and trash disposal; and 
sanitary landfill facilities. These types of public health functions or 
services contribute directly to the general health and well being of the 
geographical area served, and public agencies may acquire surplus 
property to support these programs.
    (vi) Public safety. Public safety includes not only law enforcement 
agencies but agencies involved in the prevention, control, and treatment 
of alcohol and drug abuse; agencies which provide services to children 
such as child care centers and activities serving neglected, dependent, 
abused, and delinquent children; and agencies and courts within the 
criminal justice system. Equally essential to public safety are State 
and local civil defense agencies and local fire departments and rescue 
squads. The availability of fire and rescue equipment at public airports 
is another illustration of an equally vital public safety requirement.
    (vii) Programs for older individuals. State or local government 
agencies which receive funds appropriated for older individuals under 
the Older Americans Act of 1965, as amended, under title IV or title XX 
of the Social Security Act, or under titles VIII or X of the Economic 
Opportunity Act of 1964 and the Community Services Block Grant Act are 
eligible to receive surplus property through donation. Programs for 
older individuals include services that are necessary for the general 
welfare of older individuals, such

[[Page 600]]

as social services, transportation services, nutrition services, legal 
services, and multipurpose senior centers.
    (c) Eligibility of nonprofit tax-exempt activities. Surplus personal 
property may be donated through the State agency to nonprofit tax-exempt 
activities, as defined in this section, within the State, such as:
    (1) Medical institutions;
    (2) Hospitals;
    (3) Clinics;
    (4) Health centers;
    (5) Providers of assistance to homeless individuals;
    (6) Schools;
    (7) Colleges;
    (8) Universities;
    (9) Schools for the mentally retarded;
    (10) Schools for the physically handicapped;
    (11) Child care centers;
    (12) Radio and television stations licensed by the Federal 
Communications Commission as educational radio or educational television 
stations;
    (13) Museums attended by the public;
    (14) Libraries, serving free all residents of a community, district, 
State or region; or
    (15) Organizations or institutions that receive funds appropriated 
for programs for older individuals under the Older Americans Act of 
1965, as amended, under title IV and title XX of the Social Security 
Act, or under titles VIII and X of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 
and the Community Services Block Grant Act. Programs for older 
individuals include services that are necessary for the general welfare 
of older individuals, such as social services, transportation services, 
nutrition services, legal services, and multipurpose senior centers.
    (d) Educational and public health purposes. Surplus personal 
property acquired through the State agency must be used by a nonprofit 
educational or public health institution or organization for purposes of 
education or public health as defined in this section, including 
research for any such purpose. While this does not preclude the use of 
donated property by an eligible nonprofit educational or public health 
institution or organization for a related or subsidiary purpose incident 
to the institution's overall program, the property must be used 
essentially for the primary educational or public health function for 
which the activity receives donable property and not for a nonrelated or 
commercial purpose. The enumeration of institutions and organizations in 
Sec. 101-44.207(c) is descriptive and not exclusive and is not intended 
to preclude determinations by the State agency of eligibility for other 
nonprofit educational and public activities. These activities may 
include but are not limited to:
    (1) Geriatric centers which are public health institutions and which 
furnish public health and medical services to the aged;
    (2) Nursing homes which are public health institutions providing 
skilled nursing care and related medical services to individuals 
admitted because of illness, disease, or physical or mental infirmity. 
(A nursing home may be considered as a qualified public health 
institution if it is either a:
    (i) Nursing home operated in connection with a hospital;
    (ii) Facility for long-term care of convalescents, chronic disease 
patients, or other persons who require skilled nursing care and related 
medical services in which the nursing care and medical services are 
prescribed by or are performed under the general direction of persons 
licensed to practice medicine or surgery in the State; or
    (iii) Nursing home certified to provide health services to medicaid 
or medicare patients under the provisions of the Social Security Act. 
(Nursing homes which do not meet these requirements or the primary 
purpose of which is domiciliary care will not be considered as 
qualifying as public health institutions); and
    (3) Alcohol and drug abuse treatment centers which are clinics or 
medical institutions and which provide for the diagnosis, treatment, and 
rehabilitation of alcoholics and drug addicts. These centers should have 
available professional medical staffs on a regular visiting basis.
    (e) Determinations of eligibility. The State agency is responsible 
for determining that an applicant is eligible as a public agency or a 
nonprofit educational or public health institution or

[[Page 601]]

organization to participate in the program and receive donations of 
surplus personal property.
    (f) Application for eligibility. Each State agency shall maintain a 
complete and current record for each eligible donee. This record shall 
include the following:
    (1) Application. The application shall set forth the:
    (i) Legal name and the address of the applicant;
    (ii) Status of the applicant as a public agency or as an eligible 
nonprofit tax-exempt activity (evidence shall be included in the file 
that the applicant is a public agency or has been determined to be 
nonprofit and tax-exempt under section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code 
of 1954);
    (iii) Details concerning the applicant's public program activities 
or, whenit is an eligible nonprofit tax-exempt activity, the specific 
programs and facilities operated by the applicant (Sufficient details 
and specifics should be available so that the State agency can determine 
the program eligibility qualifications of the applicant, including any 
of those activities defined in Sec. 101-44.207(a).); and
    (iv) Evidence that the applicant is approved, accredited, or 
licensed, when it is a requirement of one or more of the applicant's 
programs, or certification of funding when the applicant is a nonprofit 
tax-exempt activity that conducts programs for older individuals.
    (2) Authorization. A written authorization signed by the chief 
administrative officer or executive head of the donee activity, or a 
resolution by the governing board or body of the donee activity, which 
shall designate one or more representatives to act for the applicant 
acquiring donable property from the State agency, to obligate any 
necessary funds of the applicant for this purpose, and to execute the 
State agency distribution document including terms, conditions, 
reservations, and restrictions that the State agency or GSA may 
establish on the use and disposal of the property.
    (3) Assurance. Necessary assurances that the applicant will comply 
with GSA regulations on nondiscrimination as set forth in subpart 101-
6.2 and part 101-8 must be provided in the format prescribed by GSA.
    (g) Needs and resources. In order that the State agency in 
distributing property can give fair and equitable consideration to the 
relative needs and resources of the donees within the State and their 
ability to use the property, the State agency may require each 
applicant, when submitting an application for eligibility determination, 
to provide a statement on the types and kinds of equipment, vehicles, 
machines, or other items of property needed by the applicant for use in 
the applicant's particular public programs, or, in the case of eligible 
nonprofit tax-exempt activities, the authorized programs to be served by 
the use of the equipment and the scope of these programs. The State 
agency may also request any financial information needed to evaluate the 
relative financial needs and resources of the applicant.
    (h) Maintaining eligibility. The State agency shall update donee 
eligibility records as required to ensure continuing eligibility. 
Records for public agencies and nonprofit tax-exempt donees must be 
updated on a continuing basis, as frequently as necessary, to ensure 
that all documentation required to justify the donee's eligibility is 
current and accurate. Particular care must be taken to ensure that the 
donee resolution is current and that the statement of designated 
representatives contained therein is correct. When an eligible donee 
ceases to operate or when it loses its license, accreditation, or 
approval or otherwise fails to maintain its eligibility status, the 
State agency shall terminate its distribution of property to the 
activity.
    (i) Conditional eligibility. In certain cases, newly organized 
activities may not have commenced operations or completed construction 
of their facilities, or may not yet have been approved, accredited, or 
licensed as may be required to qualify as eligible donees. In other 
cases, there may be no specific authority which can approve, accredit, 
or license the applicant as required for qualification. In these cases, 
the State agency may accept letters from public authorities, either 
local or State, which the State agency deems competent (such as a board 
of health or

[[Page 602]]

a board of education) stating that the applicant otherwise meets the 
standards prescribed for approved, accredited or licensed institutions 
and organizations. In the case of educational activities, letters from 
three accredited or approved institutions that students from the 
applicant institution have been and are being accepted may be deemed 
sufficient by the State agency. In the case of public health 
institutions or organizations, licensing may be accepted by the State 
agency as evidence of approval in States where there is no authority 
which can as a legal or as a policy matter, approve hospitals, clinics, 
health centers, or medical institutions, provided the licensing 
authority prescribes the medical requirements and standards for the 
professional and technical services of the institution. If the 
construction of an applicant's facility or physical plant has not been 
completed, the State agency, after evaluating the progress and potential 
of the applicant, may at its discretion make available surplus items of 
property which can be immediately utilized at this point in the 
applicant's program. Under no circumstances shall conditional 
eligibility be granted to a potentially eligible nonprofit tax-exempt 
applicant before the State agency has received from the applicant a copy 
of a letter of determination by the Internal Revenue Service stating 
that the applicant is exempt from Federal taxation under section 501 of 
the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.

Sec. 101-44.208  Property distributed to donees.

    (a) Distribution document. Donation of surplus personal property 
shall be accomplished by the use of a prenumbered State agency 
distribution document which shall include the:
    (1) Certifications and agreements required of the donee by the State 
agency, including an agreement to hold the Government harmless from any 
or all debts, liabilities, judgments, costs, demands, suits, actions, or 
claims of any nature arising from or incident to the donation of the 
property, its use, or final disposition;
    (2) Condition that the donee will return to the State agency, at its 
own expense, any donated property that is not placed in use for the 
purposes for which it was donated within 1 year of donation, or which 
ceases to be used by the donee for those purposes within 1 year of being 
placed in use, provided the property is still usable as determined by 
the State agency or the donee agrees to make the property available for 
retransfer or other disposal by the State agency;
    (3) Terms, conditions, reservations, and restrictions, imposed by 
the State agency as provided in the State plan of operation on the use 
of any item of property having a unit acquisition cost of $5,000 or more 
and any passenger motor vehicle;
    (4) Terms, conditions, reservations, or restrictions imposed on any 
other donated item by the State agency;
    (5) Conditions imposed by GSA, if any, requiring special handling or 
use limitations on donated property; and
    (6) Period of restriction during which the donee must use the 
property for the purpose for which it was acquired.
    (b) Donation purpose. At the time donable surplus property is 
acquired by a donee, the donee's authorized representative shall 
indicate on the State agency's distribution document the primary purpose 
for which the property is to be used. In the case of public agencies, 
such usage could be for public purposes, such as conservation, economic 
development, education, parks and recreation, public health, programs 
for providing assistance to homeless individuals, public safety, 
museums, State Indians, or programs for older individuals. When the 
property is to be used for a combination of these purposes or for some 
other public purpose, the distribution document shall so indicate. With 
respect to nonprofit institutions or organizations, the purpose shall be 
shown as education, public health, programs for providing assistance to 
homeless individuals, museums, or programs for older individuals.
    (c) Conditional title. Conditional title to surplus personal 
property shall pass to an eligible donee when the donee has executed the 
State agency distribution

[[Page 603]]

document and taken possession of the property.
    (d) Utilization surveys. The State agency shall make utilization 
surveys and reviews, as provided in the State plan of operation, to 
ensure that donated property during the period of restriction is being 
used by the donee for the purposes for which it was acquired.
    (e) Compliance. The State agency shall take the necessary action to 
correct any noncompliance involving the use of donated property or to 
enforce the terms, conditions, reservations, and restrictions imposed on 
the use of the property, either by the State agency or GSA. 
Noncompliance may involve but not be limited to:
    (1) Property not placed in use by the donee;
    (2) Property no longer needed by the donee within the period of 
restriction;
    (3) Unauthorized use of property by the donee during the period of 
restriction; or
    (4) Unauthorized disposal of property by the donee during the period 
of restriction.
    (f) Enforcement of compliance. Enforcement of compliance during the 
period of restriction may involve action by the State agency to:
    (1) Place the property in proper use by the donee;
    (2) Transfer the property to another donee having need and use 
therefor;
    (3) Return the property to the State agency for distribution to 
other donees in the State or to another State agency having need and use 
therefor;
    (4) Transfer the property through GSA to a Federal agency;
    (5) Sell the property;
    (6) Recover the gross proceeds realized from the disposal or the 
fair market value of the property, whichever is greater, when it is 
impossible or impracticable to recover property disposed of improperly 
during the period of restriction; and
    (7) Recover the fair rental value if the property was used in an 
unauthorized manner during the period of restriction.
    (g) Coordination with GSA. In enforcing compliance with the terms 
and conditions imposed on donated property, the State agency shall 
coordinate with GSA before undertaking the sale of, or making demand for 
payment of the fair market value or fair rental value of donated 
property which:
    (1) Is subject to any special handling condition or use limitation 
imposed by GSA or
    (2) Has not been placed into use by the donee, for the purposes for 
which acquired, within 1 year of donation, or which has not been used 
for these purposes for 1 year after being placed in use.
    (h) Waivers. A State agency may amend, modify, or grant releases for 
appropriate reasons from the terms, conditions, reservations, or 
restrictions it has imposed on the use of donated property, provided 
that it has set forth in the State plan of operation the standards by 
which actions shall be taken by the State agency. Amendments, 
corrections, or releases shall not be granted by the State agency, 
however, with respect to:
    (1) The requirement that usable property be returned by the donee to 
the State agency if the property has not been placed in use for the 
purposes for which it was donated within 1 year of donation or ceases to 
be used by the donee for those purposes within 1 year of being placed in 
use; except that the State agency may grant authority to the donee to 
cannibalize or accomplish secondary utilization of property items 
subject to this requirement when the State agency determines that such 
action will result in increased utilization of the property and that the 
proposed action meets the standards prescribed in the State plan of 
operation with respect to amendments, modifications, or releases of the 
terms and conditions imposed on donated property; or
    (2) Any special handling condition or use limitation imposed by GSA 
except with the prior approval of GSA.
    (i) Disposition of recovered property. Personal property items 
returned to a State agency by a donee shall be redistributed by the 
State agency to other donees in the State or otherwise transferred or 
disposed of in accordance with the provisions of the State plan of 
operation if the property was returned (1) while subject to any special 
handling condition or use limitation imposed by GSA or (2) because the 
property had not been placed in use within 1 year of

[[Page 604]]

donation for the purposes for which it was acquired, or not used for

reservations, or restrictions imposed by the State agency may be 
redistributed, transferred, or disposed of as determined by the State 
agency.
    (j) Deposit of funds. Any funds, including the gross proceeds of 
sale or the fair market value or the fair rental value of the property, 
derived by the State agency from enforcement of compliance involving a 
breach of any special handling condition or use limitation imposed on 
donated property by GSA, or involving donated property which had not 
been placed in use for the purposes for which it was acquired within 1 
year of donation or not used for those purposes for 1 year after being 
placed in use by the donee, shall be remitted promptly by the State 
agency to GSA for deposit in the Treasury of the United States. The 
remittance shall be accompanied by supporting documentation indicating 
the source of the funds and essential background information. Funds 
derived by the State agency from the compliance action involving any 
term, condition, reservation, or restriction imposed on the donee by the 
State agency and funds derived by the State agency from any amendment, 
modification, or release thereof during the period of restriction may be 
retained and used by the State agency as provided in its plan of 
operation.
    (k) Reimbursement to donees. (1) When a donee has used but no longer 
has a need or use for donated property which is subject to any special 
handling condition or use limitation imposed by GSA, and no breach of 
the conditions or limitations has occurred, the donee may be reimbursed 
on a prorated basis for the initial cost of repairs required to make the 
item usable when the property is transferred to a Federal agency or sold 
for the benefit and account of the United States of America.
    (2) The State agency shall recommend for GSA approval the amount of 
reimbursement to which the donee is entitled, taking into consideration 
the benefit the donee has received from the use of the property and 
making appropriate deductions therefor. In the case of sale, 
reimbursement to a donee for any item of property shall not exceed the 
proceeds of the sale of the item. Reimbursement for property to be 
transferred to a Federal agency will be made a condition of the transfer 
by GSA.

Sec. 101-44.4901-123-1  Instructions for preparing and processing Standard Form 123.

    (a) Preparing Standard Form 123--(1) General--(i) The Standard Form 
123 must include all information specified on the form. Particular care 
should be taken to ensure that the transfer order indicates the surplus 
release date (SRD), sometimes referred to as the automatic release date 
(ARD); identifies property as reportable or nonreportable; shows 
applicable GSA, Department of Defense (DOD), and holding activity 
control or report numbers; indicates the holding agency document or 
voucher number for nonreportable property; and contains authorized 
signatures in ink on the original (copies of transfer orders may have 
stamped signatures). All other entries must be typed or printed. All 
city and State addresses shown on the form should include the ZIP code. 
Transfer orders received without sufficient information will be returned 
to the applicant or held in suspense until the missing information is 
obtained from the appropriate source. SF 123-A (Continuation sheet) 
shall be used for listing any additional property.
    (ii) Reportable property, nonreportable property and property 
located at separate locations should not be requested on the same SF 
123.
    (iii) Recognized abbreviations for Federal agencies or donee 
organizations may be used in completing SF 123; e.g., GSA (General 
Services Administration); FAA (Federal Aviation Administration, 
Department of Transportation); SA (State agency); BSA (Boy Scouts of 
America); and DRMS (Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service).
    (2) Adjustments and disapprovals. Any adjustment or partial 
disapproval made for the property listed in block 12 shall be initialed 
by the representative and/or officer signing in block 13b, 13d, 14b, or 
14d. When a transfer order is disapproved in its entirety, the 
representative or officer who disapproves the action will return the SF 
123 to the applicant with an explanation of the disapproval. When a line 
item is disapproved, it will be crossed out, marked ``disapproved,'' and 
initialed by the representative or officer making the deletion.
    (3) Entries--(i) Order number(s) (block 1). Enter the State serial 
number and/or transfer order and control numbers assigned by DOD, FAA, 
or the donees. If the continuation sheet (SF 123-A) is used, it must 
contain the same transfer order number(s).
    (ii) Type of Order (block 2). Insert ``X'' in the appropriate square 
to identify the type of order.

    (iv) Set-Aside Date (block 4). Enter the date on which nonreported 
property was set aside at the holding agency by an authorized donee 
representative, pursuant to Sec. 101-44.109. The insertion of a set-

available as surplus and that the holding agency has agreed to set the 
property aside pending receipt of donation approval.
    (v) Type of Property (block 5). Insert an ``X'' in the appropriate 
square to identify the property as reportable or nonreportable to GSA. 
An ``X'' shall not be inserted to identify the property as nonreportable 
when any property listed is either reportable to GSA or had previously 
been reported on SF 120, Report of Excess Personal Property, to GSA in 
accordance with Sec. 101-43.311. Reportable property never loses its 
identity.

property screened by DRMS but not reported to GSA for screening may be

27A, Purchaser's Receipt and Authority to Release Property, that 
property may be released to the purchaser. (See Secs. 101-45.4902-27A 
(over-the-counter and self-mailer)). Upon completion of a sale, the 
servicing GSA finance office will simultaneously forward to the holding

[[Page 623]]

activity additional copies of the GSA Form 27A and completed copies of 
Standard Form 1081, Voucher and Schedule of Withdrawals and Credits, for 
use as internal accounting documents.
    (b) If a purchaser fails to remove property within the period 
specified, the GSA regional office shall be advised of this fact, in 
writing, immediately in order that appropriate action may be taken.
    (c) The Standard Form (SF) 97, the United States Government 
Certificate to Obtain Title to a Vehicle, is a four-part form issued on 
continuous feed paper. The original certificate is produced on secure 
paper to readily identify any attempt to alter the form. The SF 97 shall 
be signed in accordance with requirements established by the head of the 
agency selling the vehicle. The SF 97 is an accountable form and is 
serially numbered during the printing process. Each agency shall have an 
accountable officer who will be responsible for the requisition, 
storage, and issuance of the SF 97. Certificates showing erasures or 
strikeovers will be considered invalid. Proper precautions shall be 
exercised by all agency accountable officers to prevent blank copies of 
the SF 97 from being obtained by unauthorized persons.
    (d) Delivery of motor vehicles to purchasers shall be evidenced by 
submission to the purchaser of a completed original of the SF 97. Two 
copies of the SF 97 shall be furnished to the owning agency (one copy 
for the reporting office and one copy for the custodian) and the other 
copy shall be furnished the contracting officer of the agency effecting 
the sale or transfer of the motor vehicle. The SF 97 is illustrated at 
Sec. 101-45.4901-97. Other certificates of release or bills of sale 
shall not be used in lieu of the SF 97. Instructions for the use of the 
SF 97 are in Sec. 101-45.4901-97-1.

<R05>
Sec. 101-45.304-1  Competitive bid sales.

    Except as provided in Sec. 101-45.304-2, property shall be sold by 
competitive bid sale after advertising, in accordance with this 
Sec. 101-45.304-1. Competitive bid sales include the following:
    (a) Sealed bid sales. In sealed bid sales, bidders shall be required 
to submit, to the office designated for receipt and opening of bids, 
sealed written bids on authorized bid forms for public opening at a time 
and place designated.
    (b) Spot bid sales. In spot bid sales, bidders shall be furnished 
with bid forms in advance of the bidding, a bid form to be used for each 
lot or unit to be separately sold. Requests for bids on items offered 
for sale shall be made by the official in charge. In requesting bids, 
the official in charge shall announce the item, its identification 
number, and a brief description of the item or lot. The right to reject 
all such bids for a lot or item shall be reserved in the terms of sale; 
and when the Invitation for Bids so specifies, lots or items for which 
all bids have been rejected may be reoffered at the same sale in order 
to secure an acceptable bid price. After examining all bids, award shall 
be made or bids rejected immediately following the offering of the item 
or lot. The bids at spot bid sales shall not be disclosed prior to the 
announcement of award for any item or lot. Where mailed written or drop 
bids are permitted, they shall not be disclosed to the public prior to 
the announcement of award. Bidders may be required to register in 
advance of the sale. Any special condition of sale shall be set out in 
the Invitation for Bids in order to assure that all bidders are afforded 
an opportunity to compete on the same terms and conditions.
    (c) Auction sales. When the terms and conditions of sale have been 
published and distributed to participating buyers, any special or 
unusual conditions of sale shall be announced by the person conducting 
the auction, immediately prior to commencement of the sale. Offerings 
must reserve in the Government, the right to accept or reject any or all 
bids. Lots for which all offers have been rejected may be reoffered 
later at the same sale to secure acceptable bids, when the published 
terms and conditions so provide.

<R05>
Sec. 101-45.304-2  Negotiated sales and negotiated sales at fixed prices.

    (a) Circumstances permitting negotiated sales. While it is the 
policy to sell property after publicly advertising for bids, property 
also may be sold by negotiation, subject to obtaining such competition 
as is feasible under the circumstances, where:
    (1) It is determined by the agency that the sale involves property:
    (i) That has an estimated fair market value not in excess of 
$15,000;
    (ii) Where public exigency will not admit of the delay incident to 
advertising;
    (iii) Where bid prices after advertising therefor are not reasonable 
(either as to all or some part of the property), or bid prices have not 
been independently arrived at in open competition, and it is determined 
that readvertising will serve no useful purpose: Provided, That all 
responsible bidders who responded to the previous advertising shall be 
afforded an opportunity to submit offers for the property; or
    (iv) That the disposal will be to a State, territory, possession, 
political subdivision thereof, or tax-supported agency therein, and that 
the estimated fair market value of the property and other satisfactory 
terms of disposal are obtained by negotiation. (See Sec. 101-45.304-12.)
    (2) Full and adequate justification therefor has been submitted to 
the head of the selling agency or his designee for prior approval, and 
he has determined:
    (i) That the public health, safety, or national security will 
thereby be promoted; or
    (ii) That it is necessary in the public interest during the period 
of a national emergency declared by the President or the Congress. The 
authority of this subdivision shall be used only with respect to a 
particular lot or lots of personal property identified by the 
Administrator of General Services or a specifically described category 
or categories of property determined by the Administrator of General 
Services during any period fixed by the Administrator of General 
Services, but not in excess of three months. Declaration of a national 
emergency alone is not justification for use of this authority; there 
must be other reasons making use of negotiation necessary in the public 
interest.
    (3) Full and adequate justification therefor has been submitted to 
the Administrator of General Services for his prior approval, and he has 
determined that the property involved is of a nature and quantity which, 
if disposed of by advertising would cause such an impact on an industry 
or industries as to adversely affect the national economy: Provided, 
That the estimated fair market value of such property and other 
satisfactory terms of disposal can be obtained by negotiation.
    (4) Negotiation is otherwise authorized by the Act or other law.
    (b) Negotiated sales at fixed prices. (1) Property may be sold at 
fixed prices, either directly or through the use of disposal 
contractors, only with prior approval by the Administrator of General 
Services (or designee) of the property categories to be sold.
    (2) In accordance with Sec. 101-45.304-12, prior to offering 
property to the public, it may be offered at fixed prices, through State 
agencies for surplus property, to State and local governments (States, 
territories, possessions, political subdivisions thereof, or tax-
supported agencies therein) which have expressed an interest in the 
property.
    (c) Explanatory statements. Subject to the exceptions stated in 
Sec. 101-45.304-2(c)(2), the selling agency shall prepare an explanatory 
statement as required by section 203(e)(6) of the Act of the 
circumstances of each proposed disposal by negotiation.
    (1) Ten copies of each explanatory statement, mechanically 
reproduced, shall be submitted to the Administrator of General Services 
for review and transmittal by the Administrator to the appropriate 
committees of the Senate and House of Representatives and a copy thereof 
shall be preserved in the files of the selling agency. Such statements 
shall be submitted as early as practicable in advance of each proposal. 
Copies of the Administrator's transmittal letters to the committees will 
be furnished to the selling agency. In the absence of any action by a 
committee on the proposed negotiated disposal, the selling agency may 
consummate the sale on or after 35 days from

[[Page 625]]

the date of the Administrator's letters transmitting the explanatory 
statement to the committees.
    (2) The explanatory statement need not be:
    (i) Transmitted for a disposal of personal property at fixed prices 
when previously authorized pursuant to Sec. 101-45.304-2(b);
    (ii) Transmitted for a disposal of personal property authorized to 
be made without advertising by any provision of law other than section 
203(e) of the Act; or
    (iii) Prepared for a disposal of personal property having a fair 
market value of $15,000 or less.
    (3) An outline for the preparation of the explanatory statement is 
shown in Sec. 101-45.4806.

Sec. 101-45.304-4  Lotting.

    To the extent practicable, and consistent with the types of property 
and usual commercial practice, property offered for sale shall be 
assembled in reasonably sized lots of like or similar items by make or 
manufacturer. Unused property shall be lotted separately from used 
items. Scrap and other property having scrap value only shall be lotted 
in accordance with established trade practice and shall generally not be 
included in the same sale with usable items. Determination of the size 
of lots shall take into consideration the buying capacities of 
prospective buyers and the requirement that adequate competition be 
obtained. Large quantities of identical items shall be lotted in such a 
way as to encourage bidding by small businesses and individuals.


<R05>
Sec. 101-45.304-5  Inspection by bidders.

    Sufficient time prior to the date for submission of bids shall be 
allowed to permit inspection by potential bidders. Such time should be a 
minimum of 7 or a maximum of 21 calendar days, depending upon the 
circumstances of the sale, the method of the sale, or the volume of 
property offered for sale. Whenever the inspection period is proposed to 
be less than 7 days, invitations for bids, flyers, or other 
announcements shall be distributed to prospective bidders sufficiently 
in advance of the inspection period.

Sec. 101-45.304-6  Reviewing authority.

    (a) A ``reviewing authority'' is a local, regional, or departmental 
board of review of an executive agency. Under subpart 101-45.9, 
reviewing authority also includes an applicable State board of review of 
a State agency for surplus property.
    (b) Approval by reviewing authority of the agency effecting the sale 
shall be required for each proposed award when the contract value 
(actual or estimated fair market value) for property other than scrap 
exceeds the dollar thresholds listed below by method of sale:
    (1) Negotiated sale of surplus property--$15,000 or more;
    (2) Negotiated sale at fixed price of surplus or exchange/sale 
property--$25,000 or more; and
    (3) Competitive bid sale--$100,000 or more.

<R05>
Sec. 101-45.304-7  Advertising.

    Adequate public notice shall be given to each offering for sale of 
property to be disposed of after advertising. Except where the nature or 
condition of the property does not permit, advertising shall be made in 
sufficient time previous to sale to permit full and free competition. 
The extent of solicitation shall have due regard to the quantity and 
type of property to be sold, the logical market of disposal, the type of 
sale contemplated, and the public interest.
    (a) Advertising media by type of sales--(1) Sealed bid sales. In the 
case of sealed bid sales, advertising shall be by the distribution of 
written invitations for bids including public posting thereof and may be 
supplemented by newspaper or trade journal advertising (ordered in 
accordance with existing law) where advisable.
    (2) Spot bid sales. Advertising in the case of spot bid sales shall 
be by written invitation for bids or other appropriate notices, 
including public posting

[[Page 626]]

thereof. Notice of such sales may also be given by appropriate newspaper 
or trade journal advertising (ordered in accordance with existing law) 
where advisable.
    (3) Auction sales. In the case of auction sales, newspaper or trade 
journal advertising ordinarily should be employed (ordered in accordance 
with existing law) in addition to other written notice deemed 
appropriate.
    (b) Advance sale notices to Department of Commerce. In order that 
the Department of Commerce may publish regularly synopsis of principal 
proposed sales of Government personal property, the sales office shall, 
when the acquisition cost of the property to be sold at one time at one 
place is $250,000 or more, forward a notice of each proposed sale to the 
U.S. Department of Commerce, room 1300, 433 West Van Buren Street, 
Chicago, IL 60607. Where the acquisition cost is less than this amount, 
the notice may be transmitted when considered desirable. The notice 
shall be sent as early as possible in advance of the sale but at least 
20 days prior to the date when the bids will be opened, or, in the case 
of spot bid or auction sale, when the sale will be conducted. The notice 
shall be transmitted by fastest mail available and shall be in synopsis 
form suitable for printing directly from the text as transmitted without 
editing or condensing. Instructions for the preparation of advance sale 
notices, including form and content thereof are set forth in Sec. 101-
45.4910. The failure to comply with the advance notice of sale 
requirements of this Sec. 101-45.304-7(b) shall not, in and of itself, 
affect the validity of a sales award which is otherwise valid.
    (c) The appropriate GSA regional office shall be provided, at the 
time of public distribution, a copy of each invitation for bids or other 
form of offering involving contractor inventory, whether being sold by 
the contractor for the Government or by a Government activity authorized 
to conduct sales.

<R05>
Sec. 101-45.304-8  Forms prescribed.

    Standard Forms 114, 114A, 114B, 114C, 114C-1, 114C-2, 114C-3, 114C-
4, 114D, 114E, and 114F (illustrated at Secs. 1010-45.4901-114 through 
101-45.4901-114F) shall be used, where appropriate, in sales of personal 
property except that Standard Form 114C is not applicable to those sales 
involving any strategic metals, minerals, and ores which have been 
determined surplus pursuant to the Act. These forms will be stocked by 
GSA as cut sheets only. Authority for the use of such forms in styles 
other than cut sheets may be granted when requests for such deviation 
are submitted in accordance with Sec. 101-26.302.
    (a) Deviation. To ensure inclusion of appropriate terms, conditions, 
clauses, etc., in Government sales contracts, no deviation shall be made 
from the Standard Form 114 series, and no special conditions of sales 
shall be included that are inconsistent with the provisions contained 
therein, unless approval is obtained from the Commissioner, Federal 
Supply Service (F) (mailing address: General Services Administration, 
Washington, DC 20406).
    (b) Cover sheet. The development and use of a cover sheet will be at 
the option of the selling agencies, However, if a cover sheet is used, 
it should be developed so as to be uniform for and identified primarily 
with the selling agency and secondarily with the selling activities of 
such agency. The cover sheet should contain only the ``what-where-when'' 
types of information, such as the method of sale (i.e., sealed bid, spot 
bid, auction); sale (invitation for bids) number: general category(ies) 
of property being offered; identification of the selling activity; 
inspection period; and the bid opening time and date of the sale. 
Nothing of a binding nature either on the part of the bidder or the 
Government shall be included on this cover sheet.
    (c) Description of standard forms--(1) Standard Form 114, Sale of 
Government Property--Bid and Award. (i) Standard Form 114, has spaces to 
be completed by the issuing sales activity and the bidder. Some of the 
information furnished by the issuing sales activity is as follows: 
Invitation for bids number; name and address of issuing sales activity; 
person to contact for sales information; address to which bids should be 
mailed; place, date, and time

[[Page 627]]

of bid opening; whether or not bid deposit is required; and the number 
of days for payment to be made and property to be removed. In addition, 
the form provides that the Standard Form 114C, General Sale Terms and 
Conditions, and the standard form of special conditions applicable to 
the method of sale being employed are made a part of the invitation for 
bids by reference. The block indicating the standard form of special 
conditions for the appropriate method of sale must be checked by the 
issuing sales agency. If special terms and conditions in addition to 
those contained in the prescribed standard forms are to be made a part 
of the invitation by reference, such additional terms and conditions 
should be identified by a form number and so indicated in the 
appropriate place on Standard Form 114. Special terms and conditions 
that are not identified by a form number must be included in the 
invitation and not made a part thereof by reference. Standard Form 114C 
and the applicable standard form of special conditions may be attached 
to the invitation for bids at the option of the executive agency. 
Information to be furnished by the bidder is as follows: Number of days 
but not less than 10, for Government's acceptance of the bid, if 
desired; total amount of bids; amount and form of bid deposit, when 
required; whether or not property was inspected; small business 
representation; and contingent fee representation. Standard Form 114 
shall be made a part of sealed bid sales and may be used in auction and 
spot bid sales.
    (ii) The time set for bid opening or commencement of a sale shall be 
the local time at the place of bid opening or sale and shall be 
indicated in the appropriate block on Standard Form 114. The opening 
time shall include the phrase ``local time at the place of bid opening'' 
in lieu of references to ``daylight time'' or ``daylight saving time'' 
and abbreviations such as ``EDT'' or ``PDT.'' Where the block on 
Standard Form 114 does not readily permit the inclusion of the phrase 
``local time at the place of bid opening,'' an asterisk shall be used to 
call attention to an explanatory phrase which shall be stated elsewhere 
in the invitation for bids. The time set for commencement of spot bid 
and auction sales shall also be the local time at the place of sale and 
shall be indicated in an appropriate place in invitations for bids and 
sales offerings.
    (2) Standard Form 114A, Sale of Government Property--Item Bid Page--
Sealed Bid. Standard Form 114A requires entries to be made by the bidder 
prior to submission of bid. It provides for the bidder to enter the item 
number of the property on which he is bidding, his offered unit price 
bid per item, and his total price bid per item. Except as provided in 
paragraph (3) of this paragraph (c), Standard Form 114A shall be made a 
part of sealed bid sales.
    (3) Standard Form 114B, Sale of Government Property--Item Bid Page--
Sealed Bid. Standard Form 114B may be used in lieu of Standard form 114A 
only when:
    (i) The number of items of property being sold can be described 
sufficiently on one page;
    (ii) Property is offered on an ``as generated'' basis (term-type 
sale);
    (iii) Bidding on an increment basis is permitted by the terms and 
conditions of the sale; or
    (iv) The use of Standard Form 114A might not be appropriate, in 
which case a short, accurate, and to the extent feasible, commercially 
clear description shall be prepared for each item offered for sale.
    (4) Standard Form 114C, Sale of Government Property--General Sale 
Terms and Conditions. Standard Form 114C, is applicable to all sales of 
personal property (including sales by negotiation) and shall be made a 
part of all sales invitations, either by reference or by attachment 
thereto or both.
    (5) Standard Form 114C-1, Sale of Government Property--Special 
Sealed Bid Conditions. Standard Form 114C-1, is in addition to the 
Standard Form 114C and is applicable only to sealed bid sales (other 
than term-type sales) and shall be made a part of all such sales 
invitations, either by reference or by attachment thereto or both.
    (6) Standard Form 114C-2, Sale of Government Property--Special 
Sealed Bid-Term Conditions. Standard Form 114C-2, is applicable only to 
sealed bid term-type sales and is in addition to the Standard Form 114C. 
The form shall be

[[Page 628]]

made a part of all such sales invitations, either by reference or by 
attachment thereto, or both.
    (7) Standard Form 114C-3, Sale of Government Property--Special Spot 
Bid Conditions. Standard Form 114C-3, is applicable only to spot bid 
sales and is in addition to the Standard Form 114C. The form shall be 
made a part of all sales announcements, bidders registers, and bid 
cards, either by reference or by attachment thereto or both.
    (8) Standard Form 114C-4, Sale of Government Property--Special 
Auction Conditions. Standard Form 114C-4, is applicable only to auction 
sales and is in addition to the Standard Form 114C. The form shall be 
made a part of all sales announcements and bidders registers, either by 
reference or by attachment thereto or both.
    (d) Other special conditions. (1) Other special terms and conditions 
considered by a selling agency to be necessary for the particular 
property offered for sale and not inconsistent with those contained in 
the forms prescribed in this Sec. 101-45.304-8 may be incorporated in 
invitations for bids in which these forms are used. These additional 
terms and conditions should be kept to a minimum. To the extent 
practicable, incorporation of these special conditions should be 
accomplished by a special form developed by the selling agency for that 
purpose and so indicated on Standard Form 114, Sale of Government 
Property--Bid and Award. Each selling agency shall review periodically 
these terms and conditions that are commonly used in its agency to 
standardize those in general use and eliminate unnecessary additions. 
The agency shall periodically forward to the Commissioner, Federal 
Property Resources Service (General Services Administration (D), 
Washington, DC 20406), the additional terms and conditions desirable for 
inclusion in the Standard Forms.
    (2) Standard Form 114, Sale of Government Property--Bid and Award, 
incorporates by reference Standard Form 114C and Standard Forms 114C-1 
and 114C-2, as appropriate. Therefore, it is not necessary to attach 
such forms each time invitations for bids are issued, but an agency may 
elect to do so. It is essential, however, that any terms and conditions 
incorporated in an invitation by reference be furnished to any 
prospective bidder promptly on request.
    (e) Standard Form 114D, Sale of Government Property--Amendment of 
Invitation for Bids/Modification of Contract. Standard Form 114D, is 
applicable to all sales of personal property and shall be used as 
required.
    (1) Amendment. (i) If after issuance of an invitation for bids, but 
before the time set for opening of bids or the start of a sale, it 
becomes necessary to make changes to the invitation, the changes shall 
be accomplished by the issuance of an amendment to the invitation for 
bids on Standard Form 114D. The amendment shall be sent to each firm or 
individual to whom the invitation for bids has been furnished and shall 
be displayed in the bid room. In the event an amendment must be issued 
to either an auction or spot bid invitation for bids in which mailed-in 
bids are not authorized and where time does not permit distribution by 
mail, such amendment may be issued at the time of bidder registration.
    (ii) When an invitation is canceled, bids which have been received 
shall be returned unopened to the bidders and a notice of cancellation 
sent to all prospective bidders to whom invitations for bids were issued 
identifying the invitation and briefly explaining the reason for the 
cancellation.
    (2) Supplemental agreement. A supplemental agreement is required for 
a contract modification which, in accordance with the contractual 
provisions, cannot be accomplished by unilateral action of the 
Government. Such supplemental agreement must be mutually agreed to by 
both parties and be distributed in the same manner as the original 
contract. Modifications to contracts require careful consideration 
before issuance and the sales contracting officer should be absolutely 
certain that the information contained in the supplemental agreement is 
accurate. In addition, the sales contracting officer must satisfy 
himself that the contract modification is authorized and that as a 
result of the contract modification, the purchaser will enjoy no 
advantage or gain which is uncompensated, or which would not reasonably 
flow from

[[Page 629]]

the terms and conditions of the invitation for bids or the solicitation 
of offers out of which the original contract arose.
    (f) Standard Form 114E, Sale of Government Property--Negotiated 
Sales Contract. Standard Form 114E, is applicable only to negotiated 
sales and is used to confirm quotations received from offerors 
contracted by the selling activity and constitutes the sales contract 
upon execution by the purchaser and by the Government. Standard Form 
114E shall have attached thereto or made a part thereof by reference, 
Standard Form 114C, General Sale Terms and Conditions, and those 
additional special terms and conditions applicable only to the specific 
negotiation concerned.
    (g) Standard Form 114F, Sale of Government Property--Item Bid Page--
Spot Bid or Auction. Standard Form 114F, is used only when mailed-in 
bids are authorized in connection with a spot bid or auction sale.
    (h) Description of property for sale. The invitation for bids shall 
include a listing of the property being offered for sale and each unit 
or line item shall be assigned a specific item number. The property 
should be adequately described including all factual information 
necessary to convey to prospective bidders an accurate, concise, and 
clear understanding of the property being offered. To the extent 
applicable, the following guideline information should be included as a 
part of the description:
    (1) Noun name and other descriptive information expressed in 
understandable commercial terms.
    (2) Part numbers and pertinent specifications as to sizes, type, 
etc.
    (3) Manufacturers' name or trade name and year of manufacture.
    (4) Estimated total weight or cube.
    (5) Condition of property limited generally to statements of fact 
such as ``unused'' or ``used.'' To these general statements there may be 
added, when known and applicable, information such as ``parts missing,'' 
``wrecked,'' ``major components removed,'' etc.
    (6) Quantity stated in the same unit of measure as that for which 
bids are solicited (each, pound, ton, per lot, etc.), such units to 
conform with established trade practices in the industry or commodity 
area in which the property falls.
    (7) Original acquisition cost, if known, or estimated cost (and so 
indicated) may be included.
    (8) Location of the property; dates and time available for 
inspection; and name, title, and telephone number of custodian.
    (i) Removal of property. A reasonable period of time shall be 
afforded successful purchasers to effect complete removal of the 
property and must be set forth in the invitation for bids.

shall be 20 percent of the total amount of the bid. For sales of 
property on an ``as generated'' basis during a stated period of time 
(referred to as term contracts), the normal deposit shall not be less 
than an amount which will adequately protect the Government's interest, 
normally 20 percent of the estimated contract price. However, the bid 
deposit for a term contract in excess of 1 year's duration shall not 
exceed 20 percent of the total price estimated for 1 year's removal of 
property.
    (b) Whenever a bid deposit is required by the terms and conditions 
of the invitation for bids, such deposit shall be in U.S. currency or 
any form of credit instrument other than a promissory note, made payable 
on demand in U.S. currency, except as provided for in condition number 4 
of Standard Form 114C, General Sales Terms and Conditions. Postdated 
credit instruments are

[[Page 630]]

not acceptable. Deposit bonds submitted on Standard Forms 150 and 151 
(illustrated in Secs. 101-45.4901-50 and 101-45.4901-151) may also be 
accepted when provided for in the invitation for bids.
    (c) Irrevocable commercial letters of credit issued by a bank 
established in the United States, payable to the Treasurer of the United 
States or to the Government agency conducting the sale, may be used in 
lieu of the foregoing forms of deposit. Such letters shall be 
substantially in the format shown in Sec. 101-45.4802. General 
instructions relating to the preparation of letters of credit are also 
contained in Sec. 101-45.4803.
    (d) Any draft drawn against such letter of credit shall be 
substantially in the format shown in Sec. 101-45.4804. The draft shall 
be accompanied by a transmittal letter and certification substantially 
in the format shown in Sec. 101-45.4805.
    (e) Final payments shall be acceptable in the same forms as for bid 
deposits, with the exception of deposit bonds.
    (f) Potential buyers shall be notified as to the exact 
organizational entity to the order of which the prescribed form of 
deposit is to be made payable. In no event shall a bid be rejected 
solely on the grounds that the instrument of deposit is made payable to 
the Treasurer of the United States when the offering specifies that it 
be made payable to the Government agency conducting the sale, or 
conversely, as the case may be.

agencies for surplus property may impose a fee on purchasers for costs 
incurred.
    (3) When sales are made to State and local governments, the 
requirements for bid deposits and payments for property prior to removal 
shall be waived. However, payment must be made within 30 calendar days 
after purchase. If payment is not made within this timeframe, simple 
interest may be charged at the rate which has been established by the 
Secretary of the Treasury as provided in section 12 of the Contract 
Disputes Act of 1978 (Pub. L. 95-563), from the date of first written 
demand until paid.
    (b) Definitions. The following terms shall have the meanings set

    (1) Estimated fair market value. The selling agency's best estimate 
of what the property would be sold for if offered for public sale.
    (2) State agency. State agency means the agency in each State 
designated under State law as responsible for the distribution within 
the State of all donations of surplus property to public agencies and

Sec. 101-46.303(b)(1)). When two or more State agencies have indicated a 
desire to purchase the same item, quotations should be obtained from 
such interested parties. When only one State agency wants the property, 
and no further competition is feasible under the circumstances and all 
other conditions for negotiation have been met, the sale may be made.
    (1) With the exception of items having an estimated fair market 
value of less than $100, selling agencies may honor requests by State 
agencies for State and local governments to purchase property by 
negotiation prior to offering the property for public sale.

[[Page 632]]

    Except for contractor inventory where retention by the contractor is

Sec. 101-45.307  Proceeds from sales.

    Section 201(c) of the Act, authorizes any executive agency to apply 
the proceeds from sale of exchange/sale property in whole or in part 
payment for similar items acquired for replacement purposes. Section 
204(a) of the Act requires, except in certain specified instances, that 
proceeds from sale of surplus personal property shall be covered into 
the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts. The exceptions are where 
property sold was originally acquired by funds not appropriated from the 
general fund of the Treasury, or appropriated therefrom and by law 
reimbursable from assessments, taxes, or other revenues; and where any 
contract entered in to by any executive agency or any subcontract under 
such contract authorizes the proceeds of any sale of contractor 
inventory to be credited to the price or cost of the work covered

[[Page 633]]

by such contract or subcontract. In these cases, the gross proceeds from 
the sale of such property will be deposited by the selling agency or by 
contractor or subcontractor to the reimbursable fund or appropriation or 
paid to the Federal agency accountable for the property. In all other 
cases, the gross proceeds from the sale of property will be deposited by 
the selling agency to the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts. Therefore, 
it is essential that the Standard Form 120, Report of Excess Personal 
Property, or Standard Form 126, Report of Personal Property for Sale, be 
properly completed to identify the appropriate appropriation or fund 
symbol, title, and station deposit symbol or station account number, or 
other manner in which payment is desired.

    (a) For the purpose of this section, vehicle reconditioning means 
restoring or improving the appearance of any motorized passenger or 
cargo vehicle designed primarily for highway use that is to be disposed 
of through surplus or exchange/sale procedures to the general public.

commensurate with the estimated fair market value of each vehicle 
scheduled for sale.

accomplished just prior to the dates scheduled for public inspection and 
sale.

floors and seats; (iii) clean dashboard, instrument panel, armrests, 
door panels, and rear shelf; (iv) remove Government stickers or decals

return on the sale of a vehicle. Generally, a return of $2.00 for each 
dollar invested should be estimated to justify additional 
reconditioning. Additional reconditioning should include some or all of 
the following:

    (b) Four-wheeled ATVs no longer needed by the Government can be 
exchanged with a dealer under the provisions of Sec. 101-46.302. If the 
unit cannot be exchanged, four-wheeled ATVs may be offered for public 
sale only after they have been mutilated in a manner to prevent 
operational use.

Sec. 101-45.310  Antitrust laws.

    Whenever an award is proposed to any private interest of personal 
property with an estimated fair market value of $3,000,000 or more, or 
of a patent, process, technique, or invention, irrespective of cost, the 
selling agency shall promptly notify the Attorney General and the 
Administrator of General Services, simultaneously, of the proposed 
disposal and the probable terms and conditions thereof. Upon request by 
the Attorney General, the agency shall furnish or cause to be furnished 
to the Attorney General such additional information as the agency may 
possess concerning the proposed disposition. The Attorney General will 
advise the agency and the Administrator of General Services within a 
reasonable time, in no event to exceed 60 days after receipt of such 
notification, whether, so far as the he can determine, the proposed 
disposition would tend to create or maintain a situation inconsistent 
with the antitrust laws. The agency shall not effect disposition until 
it has received such advice. The agency shall include in the 
notification transmitted to the Attorney General and the Administrator 
of General Services, the following information:
    (a) Location and description of property (specifying the tonnage, if 
scrap).
    (b) Proposed sale price of property (explaining the circumstances, 
if proposed purchaser was not highest bidder).
    (c) Acquisition cost of property to Government.
    (d) Manner of sale, indicating whether by:

    (3) Negotiation (explaining why property was not offered for sale by 
competitive bid).

Sec. 101-45.311  Assistance in controlling unauthorized transport of property.

    In order to help alleviate the problems associated with unauthorized 
transport of property sold by the Government, and to assist the 
Interstate Commerce Commission in improving control of transportation 
for hire, the following information shall be made known to all 
purchasers and shall be included as a ``Special Instruction to Bidders'' 
in all formal invitations requesting bids or offers for the sale of 
personal property:

    Attention is invited to the fact that the Interstate Commerce Act 
makes it unlawful for anyone other than those duly authorized pursuant 
to that Act to transport this property in interstate commerce for hire. 
Anyone aiding or abetting in such violation is a principal in committing 
the offense (49 U.S.C. 301-327 and 18 U.S.C. 2).

Sec. 101-45.312  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 101-45.313  Procedures and forms concerning contingent or other fees for soliciting or securing contracts.


<R05>
Sec. 101-45.313-1  Purpose.

    For the purpose of promoting uniformity among executive agencies 
with respect to the required use of the ``covenant against contingent 
fees'' and with respect to the procedure for obtaining information 
concerning contingent or other fees paid by contractors for soliciting 
and securing Government contracts, the Department of Defense and GSA 
have developed cooperatively and agreed upon the required use of the 
``covenant against contingent fees'' and the form, procedure, 
principles, and standards described in this section.


<R05>
Sec. 101-45.313-2  Objectives and methods.

    (a) Objectives. The requirements of Sec. 101-45.313 have as their 
objective the prevention of improper influence in connection with the 
obtaining of Government contracts, the elimination of arrangements which 
encourage the payment of inequitable and exorbitant fees bearing no 
reasonable relationship to the services actually performed, and 
prevention of the reduction in return to the Government which inevitably 
results therefrom. Improper influence means influence, direct or 
indirect, which induces or intends to induce consideration or action by 
any employee or officer of the United States with respect to any 
Government contract on any basis other than the merits of the matter.
    (b) Methods. The methods used to achieve the above objectives stated 
in paragraph (a) of this section are the requirement for disclosure of 
the details of arrangements under which agents represent concerns in 
obtaining Government contracts, and the prohibiting, by use of the 
covenant against contingent fees, of certain types of contractor-agent 
arrangements. The Criminal Code will apply in any case involving actual 
criminal conduct.

<R05>
Sec. 101-45.313-3  Representation and covenant.

    (a) Representation. Except as provided in Sec. 101-45.313-7, each 
selling agency shall inquire of and secure a written representation from 
prospective purchasers as to whether they have employed or retained any 
company or person (other than a full-time employee working solely for 
the prospective purchaser) to solicit or secure the contract, and shall 
secure a written agreement to furnish information relating thereto as 
required by the sales contracting officer. The form of such 
representation shall be that contained in Standard Form 114, Sale of 
Government Property--Bid and Award (illustrated in Sec. 101-45.4901-
114).
    (b) Covenant. Selling agencies shall include in every negotiated or 
advertised contract for the sale of Government-owned personal property 
the ``covenant against contingent fees'' as contained in the Standard 
Form 114C, General Sale Terms and Conditions (illustrated in Sec. 101-
45.4901-114C).
[42 FR 40854, Aug. 12, 1977]


<R05>
Sec. 101-45.313-4  General principles and standards applicable to the covenant.

    (a) Use of principles and standards. The principles and standards 
set forth in this Sec. 101-45.313-4 are intended to be used as a guide 
in the negotiation, awarding, administration, or enforcement of 
Government contracts.
    (b) Contingent character of the fee. Any fee whether called 
commission, percentage, brokerage, or contingent fee, or otherwise 
denominated, is within the purview of the covenant if, in fact, any 
portion thereof is dependent upon success in obtaining or securing the 
Government contract or contracts involved. The fact, however, that a fee 
of a contingent nature is involved does not preclude a relationship 
which qualifies under the exceptions to the prohibition of the covenant.
    (c) Exceptions to the prohibition. There are excepted from the 
prohibition of the covenant ``bona fide employees'' and ``bona fide 
established commercial or selling agencies maintained by the contractor 
for the purpose of securing business.''
    (d) Bona fide employee. (1) The term bona fide employee, for the 
purpose of the exception to the prohibition of the covenant, means an 
individual (including a corporate officer) employed by a concern in good 
faith to devote his full time to such concern and no other concern and 
over whom the concern has the right to exercise supervision and control 
as to time, place, and manner of performance of work.

    Note: It is recognized that a concern, especially a small business 
concern, may employ an individual who represents other concerns. The 
factors set forth in Sec. 101-45.313-4(e)(2), except (iv), shall be 
applied to determine whether such an individual comes within the 
exception to the prohibition of the covenant.

    (2) The hiring must contemplate some continuity and it may not be 
related only to the obtaining of one or more specific Government 
contracts.
    (3) An employee is not ``bona fide'' who seeks to obtain any 
Government contract or contracts for his employer through the use of 
improper influence or who holds himself out as being able to obtain any 
Government contract or contracts through improper influence.
    (4) A person may be a bona fide employee whether his compensation is 
on a fixed salary basis, or when customary in the trade, on a 
percentage, commission, or other contingent basis or a combination of 
the foregoing.
    (e) Bona fide established commercial or selling agency maintained by 
the contractor for the purpose of securing business. (1) An agency or 
agent is not ``bona fide'' which seeks to obtain any Government contract 
or contracts for its principals through the use of improper influence or 
which holds itself out as being able to obtain any Government contract 
or contracts through improper influence.
    (2) In determining whether an agency is a ``bona fide established 
commercial or selling agency maintained by the contractor for the 
purpose of securing business,'' the factors set forth below shall be 
considered. They are necessarily incapable of exact measurement or 
precise definition and it is neither possible nor desirable to prescribe 
the relative weight to be given any single factor as against any other 
factor or as against all other factors. The conclusions to be reached in 
a given case

[[Page 639]]

will necessarily depend upon a careful evaluation of the agreement and 
other attendant facts and circumstances.
    (i) The fees charged should not be inequitable and exorbitant in 
relation to the services actually rendered. That is, the compensation 
should be commensurate with the nature and extent of the services and 
should not be excessive as compared with the fees customarily allowed in 
the trade concerned for similar services related to commercial (non-
Government) business. In evaluating reasonableness of the fee, there 
should be considered services of the agent other than actual 
solicitation, as for example, technical, consultant, or managerial 
services, and assistance in the procurement of essential personnel, 
facilities, equipment, materials, or subcontractors for performance of 
the contract.
    (ii) The selling agency should have adequate knowledge of the 
products and the business of the concern represented, as well as other 
qualifications necessary to sell the products or services on their 
merits.
    (iii) There should ordinarily be a continuity of relationship 
between the contractor and the agency. The fact that the agency has 
represented the contractor over a considerable period of time is a 
factor for favorable consideration. It is not intended, however, to 
disqualify newly established contractor-agency relationships where a 
continuing relationship is contemplated by the parties.
    (iv) It should appear that the agency is an established concern. The 
agency may be either one which has been in business for a considerable 
period of time or a new agency which is a presently going concern and 
which is likely to continue in business as a commercial or selling 
agency in the future. The business of the agency should be conducted in 
the agency name and characterized by the customary indicia of the 
conduct of a regular business.
    (v) The fact that a selling agency confines its selling activities 
to the field of Government contracts does not, in and of itself, 
disqualify it under the covenant. The fact, however, that the selling 
agency is employed to secure business generally, that is, to represent 
the concern in connection with sales to the Government, as well as 
regular commercial sales to non-Government activities, is a factor 
entitled to favorable consideration in evaluating the case as one coming 
within the authorized exception. Arrangements confined, however, to 
obtaining Government contracts, particularly those involving a selling 
agency organized immediately prior to or during periods of expanded 
procurement resulting from conditions of national emergency, must be 
closely scrutinized.
    (f) Fees for ``information.'' Contingent fees paid for 
``information'' leading to obtaining a Government contract or contracts 
are included in the prohibition and, accordingly, are in breach of the 
covenant unless the agent qualified under the exception as a bona fide 
employee or a bona fide established commercial or selling agency 
maintained by the contractor for the purpose of securing business.

Sec. 101-45.313-5  Standard Form 119, Contractor's Statement of Contingent or Other Fees.

    Pursuant to the Act and in furtherance of the purpose and objectives 
stated in sections 1 and 3 thereof, Standard Form 119, shall be used in 
accordance with the provisions of this Sec. 101-45.313.


<R05>
Sec. 101-45.313-6  Use of Standard Form 119, Contractor's Statement of Contingent or Other Fees.

    (a) Required use. Except as provided in Sec. 101-45.313-7, Standard 
Form 119 shall be used, without deviation, whenever either part of the 
inquiry provided for in Sec. 101-45.313-3(a) with respect to contingent 
fees is answered in the affirmative. The form shall be used also, 
without deviation, in any other case where an agency desires to obtain 
such information. When, after use of the form, further information is 
required, it may be obtained in any appropriate manner. Submission of 
the form shall be required, normally, only of successful bidders and 
contractors.
    (b) Statement in lieu of form. Any bidder who has previously 
furnished a Standard Form 119 to the office issuing the invitation or 
negotiating the contract may be permitted to accompany his bid with, or 
submit in connection with the proposed contract, a signed

[[Page 640]]

statement indicating when such completed form was previously furnished, 
identifying by number the previous invitation or contract in connection 
with which such form was submitted; and representing that the statements 
in such previously furnished form are applicable to such subsequent bid 
or contract. In such case, submission of an additional completed 
Standard Form 119 need not be required.


<R05>
Sec. 101-45.313-7  Exceptions.

    The inquiry and agreement specified in Sec. 101-45.313-3(a) need not 
be made and submission of Standard Form 119 need not be requested in 
connection with any of the following:
    (a) Any advertised contract in which the aggregate amount involved 
does not exceed $25,000.
    (b) Any negotiated contract in which the aggregate amount involved 
does not exceed $5,000.
    (c) Contracts to be made in foreign countries.
    (d) Any other contracts, individually or by class, of the Department 
of Defense, designated by the Secretary, Under Secretary, or Assistant 
Secretary of a military department. (Reports of any such exceptions 
shall be filed promptly with the Administrator of General Services.)

<R05>
Sec. 101-45.313-8  Enforcement.

    (a) Failure or refusal to furnish representation and agreement. Each 
selling agency shall take the necessary steps to assure that the 
indicated successful bidder or proposed contractor has furnished a 
representation (negative or affirmative) and agreement as prescribed in 
Sec. 101-45.313-3.
    (1) If the indicated successful bidder makes such representation in 
the negative such representation may be accepted and award made or offer 
accepted in accordance with established procedure.
    (2) If the indicated successful bidder or proposed contractor makes 
such representation in the affirmative, a completed Standard Form 119 
shall be requested from the bidder or proposed contractor. In the case 
of formal advertising, the making of an award in accordance with 
established procedure need not be delayed pending receipt of the form. 
In the case of negotiation, if the proposed contractor makes such 
representation in the affirmative, he shall be required to file a 
completed Standard Form 119 prior to acceptance of the offer or 
execution of the contract unless the head of the executive agency 
(including for this purpose, any military department) concerned, or his 
authorized representative, considers that the interest of the Government 
will be prejudiced by the suspension of negotiations pending receipt and 
consideration of an executed Standard Form 119.
    (3) If the indicated successful bidder or proposed contractor fails 
to furnish the representation and agreement, such failure shall be 
considered a minor informality and, prior to award, such bidder or 
proposed contractor shall be afforded a further opportunity to furnish 
such representation and agreement. A refusal or failure to furnish such 
representation and agreement, after such opportunity has been afforded, 
shall require rejection of the bid or offer.
    (b) Failure or refusal to furnish Standard Form 119. If the 
successful bidder or contractor, upon request, refuses or fails to 
furnish a completed Standard Form 119, or a statement in lieu thereof as 
provided in Sec. 101-45.313-6, the selling agency concerned shall take 
one or more of the following actions, or other action, as may be 
appropriate:
    (1) If an award has not been made or offer accepted, determine 
whether the bid or offer should be rejected.
    (2) If the contract has been awarded or the offer accepted, 
determine what action shall be taken, such as making an independent 
investigation or considering the eligibility of the contractor as a 
future contractor in accordance with established procedure.
    (c) Misrepresentations or violations of the covenant against 
contingent fees. In case of misrepresentation, or violation or breach of 
the covenant against contingent fees, or some other relevant 
impropriety, the selling agency concerned shall take one or more of the 
following actions, or other action, as may be appropriate:

[[Page 641]]

    (1) If an award has not been made, or offer has not been accepted, 
determine whether the bid or offer should be rejected.
    (2) If an award has been made or offer has been accepted, take 
action to enforce the covenant in accordance with its terms, that is, as 
the best interests of the Government may appear, annul the contract 
without liability or recover the amount of the fee involved.
    (3) Consider the future eligibility as a contractor of the bidder or 
contractor in accordance with established procedure.
    (4) Determine whether the case should be referred to the Department 
of Justice in accordance with established procedure with respect to 
determining matters of fraud or criminal conduct.


<R05>
Sec. 101-45.313-9  Preservation of records.

    Selling agencies shall preserve, for enforcement or report purposes, 
at least one executed copy of any representation and completed Standard 
Form 119, together with a record of any other pertinent data, including 
data as to action taken.

Sec. 101-45.314  Federal excise taxes.

    Federal manufacturers' and retailers' excise taxes are not 
applicable to the sale or other disposal by the Government of personal 
property or the disposal of contractor inventory. Federal manufacturers' 
excise taxes do not apply to subsequent sales, including uses, by 
purchasers of Government property and contractor inventory. Federal 
retailers' excise taxes apply to subsequent sales, but not to subsequent 
uses by the purchasers unless the subsequent sale is made for resale and 
a certificate of resale is obtained. The foregoing does not apply to 
gasoline, and holding agencies shall make appropriate arrangements with 
the Internal Revenue Service with respect to the disposal thereof. 
Questions relating to the applicability of Federal excise taxes arising 
from the disposal of property or contractor inventory should be referred 
to the Internal Revenue Service.


<R05>
Sec. 101-45.315  Equal Opportunity clause in contracts.

    The Equal Opportunity clause prescribed by Executive Order 11246 of 
September 24, 1965 (30 FR 12319, 12935) (as amended by Executive Order 
11375 of October 13, 1967 (32 FR 14303)), as set forth in Sec. 101-
45.4807, shall be included in all contracts for the sale of personal 
property when the contract exceeds $10,000, and an appreciable amount of 
work by the purchaser required by or for the Government is involved. 
When a sale is planned and the probability exists that the foregoing 
conditions will be present, the Equal Opportunity clause shall be 
included in the contract provisions of the invitation as a special 
condition of sale.

determination. This condition is applicable to all invitations for bids 
and requests for proposals or quotations providing for the sale of 
personal property, except fixed price sale under section 203(e)(5) of 
the Act.
    (b) The authority to make determinations described in paragraph (d) 
of Condition No. 20 of the General Sale Terms and Conditions, Standard 
Form 114C, shall not be delegated to an official below the level of the 
head of a selling activity of the agency.
    (c) Where a certification is suspected of being false or there is an 
indication of collusion, the matter shall be referred to the Department 
of Justice as provided in Sec. 101-45.107-1.

    In addition to complying with the requirements of Secs. 101-45.316 
and 101-45.317, when an invitation for bids for the sale of personal 
property results in the submission of identical bids, consideration 
shall be given to whether

[[Page 642]]

adequate prime competition was obtained. Whether there is adequate price 
competition for a given sale is a matter of judgment to be based on the 
circumstances of the sale. If the circumstances do not permit a 
reasonable determination that the price competition was adequate, the 
sale should be resolicited.

    This subpart provides guidance regarding contract claims and appeals 
relating to contracts for the sale of personal property under the 
Contract Disputes Act of 1978, as amended, (41 U.S.C. 601-613). 
Contracting agencies should seek guidance from the Contract Disputes Act 
(the Act) and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 48 CFR Part 33. The 
Act applies to all contracts entered into by executive agencies for the 
sale of personal property, except the following:
    (a) Contracts with a foreign government or agency of that government 
when the agency head determines that application of the Act to the 
contract would not be in the public interest,
    (b) Contracts with an international organization or a subsidiary 
body of that organization, if the agency head determines that the 
application of the Act to the contract would not be in the public 
interest, and
    (c) Contracts of the Tennessee Valley Authority unless such 
contracts contain a disputes clause requiring dispute resolution via an 
administrative process.


<R05>
Sec. 101-45.401  The disputes clause.

    The disputes clause contained at 48 CFR 52.233-1 must be included in

the exceptions in Sec. 101-45.400 apply.


<R05>
Sec. 101-45.402  Alternative disputes resolution.

    The Government's policy is to try to resolve all contractual issues 
in controversy by mutual agreement at the contracting officer's level. 
Agencies are encouraged to use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) 
procedures to the maximum extent practicable in accordance with the 
authority and the requirements of the Administrative Disputes Resolution 
Act (Pub. L. 101-522) and agency policies.

<R05>
Sec. 101-45.601  Policy.

    (a) Agencies shall solicit offers from, award contracts to, and 
consent to subcontracts only with responsible contractors, as defined by 
Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 9.104-1.
    (b) The policies, procedures, and requirements of FAR subpart 9.4 
are incorporated by reference and made applicable to contracts for, and 
to contractors who engage in the purchase of Federal personal property.
    (c) The debarment or suspension of a contractor from the purchase of 
Federal personal property has Governmentwide effect and precludes any 
agency from entering into a contract for purchase of personal property 
with that contractor unless the agency's head or a designee responsible 
for the disposal action determines that there is a compelling reason for 
such action. (See FAR 9.405(a).)
    (d) When the debarring/suspending official has authority to debar/
suspend contractors from both contracts for the purchase of Federal 
personal property

[[Page 643]]

pursuant to FPMR 101-45.6 and acquisition contracts pursuant to FAR 9.4, 
that official shall consider simultaneously debarring/suspending the 
contractor from the purchase of Federal personal property and the award 
of acquisition contracts. When debarring/suspending a contractor from 
the purchase of Federal personal property and the award for acquisition 
contracts, the debarment/suspension notice shall so indicate and the 
appropriate FPMR and FAR citations shall be included.

of Debarred, Suspended, and Ineligible Contractors (FAR 9.404) in 
accordance with the procedures established at FAR 9.404.
    (b) Agencies shall establish procedures for the use of the

from, award contracts to, or consent to subcontracts with listed 
contractors, except as provided in FAR 9.405(a).

submitted in advertised sales of Government personal property and 
includes the treatment of late bids received in connection with such 
sales.


<R05>
Sec. 101-45.701  Responsiveness of bids.

    (a) To be considered for award, a bid must comply in all material 
respects with the invitation for bids so that, both as to the method and 
timeliness of submission and as to the substance of any resulting 
contract, all bidders may stand on an equal footing and the integrity of 
the formal advertising system may be maintained.
    (b) Telegraphic or telephonic bids shall not be considered unless 
otherwise provided in the invitation for bids. (See Sec. 101-45.4901-
114C, item No. 3 entitled ``Consideration of Bids.'') The term 
``telegraphic bids'' includes bids submitted by telegram or by mailgram. 
The following statement should be included in all invitations for bids: 
``The terms `telegraphic bid' and `telegraphic notice' include bids and 
notices by telegram or by mailgram.''
    (c) Bids shall be filled out, executed, and submitted in accordance 
with the instructions contained in the invitation for bids. If a bidder 
uses his own bid form or a letter to submit a bid, the bid may be 
considered only if (1) the bidder accepts all the terms and conditions 
of the invitation for bids and (2) award on the bid would result in a 
binding contract, the terms and conditions of the invitation.

time and date set forth in the invitation for opening of bids, and 
except for delay attributable to personnel of the sales office or their 
designees would have been received on time; or

invitation in sufficient time to have been received by the contracting 
officer by the time and date set forth in the invitation for receipt of 
bids, and except for delay attributable to personnel of the sales office

    A late bid submitted by telegraph (where authorized) received before 
award shall not be considered for award regardless of the cause of the

contracting officer or his authorized representative. Late bids opened 
for identification purposes or by mistake shall be resealed in the 
envelope. The contracting officer or his authorized representative shall 
immediately write on the envelope his signature and position, date and 
time opened, invitation for bids number, and an explanation of the

[[Page 645]]

or withdrawal of a bid received by telephone from the receiving 
telegraph office not later than the time set for opening of bids shall 
be considered only if the message is confirmed by receipt of a copy of 
the written telegram or mailgram which formed the basis for the 
telephone call. Modifications received by telegram or mailgram 
(including a record of those telephoned by the telegraph company) shall 
be sealed in an envelope by a proper official who shall write thereon 
the date and time of receipt and by whom received, the invitation for 
bids, number, and his signature. No information contained therein shall 
be disclosed before the time set for bid opening or for the start of the 
sale. The term telegraphic notice includes modifications and withdrawals 
submitted by telegram or mailgram. The following statement should be

are received by the contracting officer after the exact time set for bid 
opening (in sealed bid sales) or after the exact time set for the 
receipt of bids (in spot bid or auction sales) are ``late 
modifications'' and ``late withdrawals'', respectively. A late 
modification or late withdrawal shall be subject to the provisions of 
Sec. 101-45.703. However, a late modification of the otherwise 
successful bid shall be opened at any time it is received; and if in the 
judgment of the contracting officer it makes the terms of the bid more 
favorable to the Government, it shall be considered.
    (b) Mailed-in, telegraphic, and mailgram modifications or 
withdrawals which are received by the contracting officer after the time 
set for the start of a spot bid or auction sale shall not be considered, 
regardless of the cause of delay.

                   Subpart 101-45.8--Mistakes in Bids

    Source: 32 FR 16270, Nov. 29, 1967, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 101-45.800  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart prescribes the policies and methods governing the 
treatment by executive agencies of mistakes in bids by bidders in sales 
of personal property. The authorities prescribed herein are not intended 
to nullify previous authorities granted by the Comptroller General.


<R05>
Sec. 101-45.801  General.

    After the opening of bids, sales contracting officers shall examine 
all bids for mistakes. Where the sales contracting officer has reason to 
believe that a mistake may have been made, he shall request from the 
bidder a verification of the bid, calling attention to the suspected 
mistake. If the bidder alleges a mistake, the matter shall be processed 
in accordance with this subpart 101-45.8. Such actions shall be taken 
prior to award.


<R05>
Sec. 101-45.802  Apparent clerical mistakes.

    Any clerical mistake apparent on the face of a bid may be corrected 
by the sales contracting officer prior to award if the sales contracting 
officer has first obtained from the bidder verification of the bid 
actually intended. An example of such an apparent mistake is an error in 
placing the decimal point (e.g., a bidder bids $10 each on 10 units, but 
shows an extended price of $1,000 or a bidder bids $0.50 per lb. for 
1,000 lbs. but shows an extended price of $50). Any correction made 
pursuant to this Sec. 101-45.802 shall be reflected in the award

[[Page 646]]

document, if an award is made on the corrected bid.


<R05>
Sec. 101-45.803  Other mistakes disclosed before award.

    (a) Heads of executive agencies are authorized (with power of 
redelegation as provided in Secs. 101-45.803(b) and 101-45.804(d)), in 
order to minimize delay in contract awards, to make the administrative 
determinations described in this Sec. 101-45.803 in connection with 
mistakes in bids alleged after opening of bids and before award. The 
authority contained herein to permit correction of bids is limited to 
bids which, as submitted, are responsive to the invitation for bids, and 
may not be used to permit correction of bids to make them responsive. 
This authority is in addition to that in Sec. 101-45.802 or that which 
may be otherwise available.
    (1) A determination may be made permitting the bidder to withdraw 
his bid where the bidder requests permission to do so and clear and 
convincing evidence establishes the existence of a mistake.
    (2) However, if the evidence is clear and convincing both as to the 
existence of a mistake and as to the bid actually intended, and if the 
bid as submitted and as corrected is the highest received, a 
determination may be made to correct the bid and not permit its 
withdrawal.
    (3) A determination may be made permitting the bidder to correct his 
bid where the bidder requests permission to do so and clear and 
convincing evidence establishes both the existence of a mistake and the 
bid actually intended. However, if the correction would result in 
displacing one or more higher acceptable bids, the determination shall 
not be made unless the existence of the mistake and the bid actually 
intended are ascertainable substantially from the invitation and bid 
itself. If the evidence is clear and convincing only as to the mistake, 
but not as to the intended bid, a determination permitting the bidder to 
withdraw his bid may be made.
    (4) If the evidence does not warrant a determination under paragraph 
(a)(1), (2), or (3) of this section, a determination may be made that a 
bidder may neither withdraw nor correct his bid.
    (b) Heads of executive agencies may delegate to one central 
authority in their agencies, without power of redelegation, authority to 
make the determinations under paragraphs (a) (2), (3), and (4) of this 
Sec. 101-45.803. The authority to make determinations to permit 
withdrawal of bids as provided in paragraphs (a) (1) and (3) of this 
section may be delegated, without power of redelegation, to any sales 
activity having legal counsel available.
    (c) Each proposed determination shall be approved by the gency's 
General Counsel, Deputy or Associate General Counsel, and Assistant 
General Counsel, or other comparable legal officer. However, authority 
to approve determinations to permit withdrawal of bids pursuant to 
paragraphs (a) (1) and (3) of this section may be delegated to the legal 
counsel of sales activities.
    (d) Suspected or alleged mistakes shall be processed as follows:
    (1) Whenever the sales contracting officer suspects that a mistake 
may have been made in a bid, he shall immediately request the bidder to 
verify the bid. Such request shall inform the bidder of the basis for 
suspecting a mistake and shall advise the bidder that if a mistake is 
alleged, to support his allegation by statements concerning the alleged 
mistake and by all pertinent evidence; such as the bidder's file copy of 
the bid, his original worksheets and other data used in preparing the 
bid, and any other evidence which conclusively establishes the existence 
of the error, the manner in which it occurred, and the bid actually 
intended. If the time for acceptance of bids is likely to expire before 
a decision can be made, the sales contracting officer shall request all 
bidders whose bids may become eligible for award to extend the time for 
acceptance of their bids. If the bidder whose bid is believed erroneous 
does not grant such extension of time and a decision cannot be reached 
before expiration of the time for acceptance, even if handled by 
telegraph or telephone as provided in Sec. 101-45.803(d)(4), the bid 
shall be considered as originally submitted.
    (2) If the bidder verifies his bid, the sales contracting officer 
shall consider it as originally submitted.

[[Page 647]]

    (3) Where the bidder furnishes evidence in support of an alleged 
mistake, the case shall be referred to the appropriate authority 
together with the following data:
    (i) All evidence furnished by the bidder.
    (ii) A copy of the bid and the invitation for bids.
    (iii) An abstract or record of the bids received.
    (iv) A written statement by the sales contracting officer setting 
forth--
    (a) The expiration date of the bid in question and of the other bids 
submitted;
    (b) Specific information as to how and when the mistake was alleged;
    (c) Most recent contract price for a like item(s) involved, when 
sold, in what quantity, relative condition, etc.;
    (d) A summary of the evidence submitted by the bidder;
    (e) Any additional evidence considered pertinent, including copies 
of all correspondence between the sales contracting officer and the 
bidder concerning the alleged mistake; and
    (f) The course of action with respect to the bid that the sales 
contracting officer considers proper on the basis of the evidence.
    (4) When time is of the essence, because of the expiration of bids 
or otherwise, the sales contracting officer may refer the case by 
telegraph or telephone to the designated authority. Ordinarily, however, 
sales contracting officers will not refer mistake in bid cases to the 
designated authority by telegraph or telephone, particularly when the 
determinations set forth in paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of this Sec. 101-
45.803 are applicable, since actual examination of the evidence is 
generally necessary to determine the proper action to be taken.
    (5) Where the bidder fails or refuses to furnish evidence in support 
of a suspected or alleged mistake, the sales contracting officer shall 
consider the bid as submitted unless there are indications of error so 
clear as reasonably to justify the conclusion that acceptance of the bid 
would be unfair to the bidder or to other bona fide bidders, in which 
case it may be rejected. This action will be cleared through counsel 
serving the cognizant sales contracting officer. The attempts made to 
obtain the information required and the action taken with respect to the 
bid shall be fully documented.
    (e) Nothing contained in this Sec. 101-45.803 shall deprive the 
Comptroller General of his statutory right to question the correctness 
of any administrative determination made hereunder nor deprive any 
bidder of his right to have the matter determined by the Comptroller 
General should he so request. All doubtful cases shall be submitted to 
the Comptroller General for advance decision in accordance with agency 
procedures.
    (f) Each agency shall maintain records of all administrative 
determinations made in accordance with this Sec. 101-45.803, the facts 
involved, and the action taken in each case. Copies of all such 
administrative determinations shall be included in the case file. Where 
a contract is awarded, the General Accounting Office copy of the 
contract, whenever filed, shall be accompanied by a signed copy of any 
related determination.

<R05>
Sec. 101-45.804  Mistakes disclosed after award.

    (a) When a mistake in bid is not discovered until after the award, 
the mistake may be corrected by supplemental agreement if correcting the 
mistake would make the contract more favorable to the Government without 
changing the essential requirements of the contract.
    (b) In addition to the cases contemplated in Sec. 101-45.804(a), 
heads of executive agencies are authorized, under the circumstances set 
forth in Sec. 101-45.804(c), to make the administrative determinations 
described below in connection with mistakes in bids alleged or disclosed 
after award. This authority is in addition to that provided by Public 
Law 85-804 (50 U.S.C. 1431-1435) or that which may be otherwise 
available.
    (1) A contract may be rescinded in its entirety where the original 
total contract amount does not exceed $10,000.

[[Page 648]]

    (2) A contract, irrespective of amount, may be reformed (i) by 
deleting the item or items involved in the mistake where the deletion 
does not reduce the contract amount by more than $10,000; or (ii) by 
decreasing the price where the resultant decrease in price does not 
exceed $10,000 and the reformed contract price is not less than that of 
the otherwise next high bid under the original invitation for bids.
    (c) Determinations under Sec. 101-45.804(b) may be made only on the 
basis of clear and convincing evidence that a mistake in bid was made, 
and either that the mistake was mutual or that the unilateral mistake 
made by the purchaser was so apparent as to have charged the sales 
contracting officer with notice of the probability of the mistake. If 
the evidence does not warrant a determination under paragraph (b)(1) or 
(2) of this Sec. 101-45.804, determination may be made that no change 
shall be made in the contract as awarded.
    (d) Heads of executive agencies may delegate to one central 
authority in their agencies, without power of redelegation, authority to 
make the determinations under this Sec. 101-45.804.
    (e) Each proposed determination shall be approved by the agency's 
General Counsel, Deputy or Associate General Counsel, an Assistant 
General Counsel, or other comparable legal officer.
    (f) Mistakes disclosed after award shall be processed as follows:
    (1) Whenever a mistake in bid is alleged or disclosed after award, 
the sales contracting officer shall advise the purchaser to support the 
alleged error by written statements and by all pertinent evidence, such 
as the purchaser's file copy of the bid, his original worksheets and 
other data used in preparing the bid, and any other evidence which will 
serve to establish the mistake, the manner in which it occurred, and the 
bid actually intended.
    (2) Where the purchaser furnishes evidence in support of an alleged 
mistake, the case shall be referred to the appropriate authority 
together with the following data:
    (i) All evidence furnished by the purchaser.
    (ii) A copy of the contract, including a copy of the bid.
    (iii) An abstract or record of the bids received.
    (iv) A written statement by the sales contracting officer setting 
forth--
    (a) Specific information as to how and when the mistake was alleged 
or disclosed;
    (b) A summary of the evidence submitted by the purchaser;
    (c) His opinion whether a bona fide mistake was made in the bid and 
whether he was, or should have been, on constructive notice of the 
mistake before the award, together with the reasons or data upon which 
his opinion is based;
    (d) Most recent contract price for a like item(s) involved, when 
sold, in what quantity, relative condition, etc.;
    (e) Any additional evidence considered pertinent, including copies 
of all relevant correspondence between the sales contracting officer and 
the purchaser concerning the alleged mistake;
    (f) The course of action with respect to the alleged mistake that 
the sales contracting officer considers proper on the basis of the 
evidence; and
    (g) The status of performance and payments under the contract, 
including contemplated performance and payments.
    (g) Nothing contained in this Sec. 101-45.804 shall deprive the 
Comptroller General of his statutory right to question the correctness 
of any administrative determination made hereunder nor deprive any 
purchaser of his right to have the matter determined by the Comptroller 
General should he so request.
    (h) Each agency shall maintain records of all administrative 
determinations made in accordance with this Sec. 101-45.804, the facts 
involved, and the action taken in each case. A copy of the determination 
shall be attached to each copy of any contract rescission or reformation 
resulting therefrom.
    (i) Where administrative determination is precluded by the 
limitations set forth in this section, the matter will be submitted to 
the Comptroller General for decision in accordance with agency 
procedures.

[[Page 649]]

    (j) Nothing contained in this Sec. 101-45.804 prevents an agency 
from submitting doubtful cases to the Comptroller General.

Sec. 101-45.901  Authority to abandon or destroy.

    Property may be abandoned or destroyed by an executive agency in 
accordance with this subpart when a written determination is made by a 
duly authorized official that the property has no commercial value, or 
the estimated cost of its continued care and handling would exceed the 
estimated proceeds from its sale, except that:
    (a) No abandonment or destruction shall be made in a manner which is 
detrimental or dangerous to public health or safety, or which will cause 
infringement of the rights of other persons.
    (b) In accordance with Sec. 101-44.205(k), a State agency is 
required to notify the appropriate GSA regional office before taking any 
abandonment or destruction action. The notification shall include a 
detailed and accurate description of the property and its condition. If 
the GSA regional office does not contact the State agency within 30 
calendar days, the property may be disposed of under this subpart.

    (a) Property may be abandoned or destroyed, without public notice, 
by an executive agency upon a written finding by an authorized official 
that was approved by a reviewing official who is not directly 
accountable for the property, that:
    (1) The value of the property is so little or the cost of its care 
and handling is so great that its retention for advertising for sale, 
even as scrap, is clearly not economical; or
    (2) Abandonment or destruction is required because of health, 
safety, or security reasons.
    (b) Any item of property with an original cost (estimated if 
unknown) of less than $500 shall normally be considered for abandonment 
or destruction, without public notice, due to the expense and difficulty 
of care and handling, such as used or obsolete charts, electric light 
bulbs, radio tubes, and resistors.

Sec. 101-45.1000  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart prescribes the policy and procedures for recovery of 
precious metals from articles of excess and surplus personal property.


<R05>
Sec. 101-45.1001  General.

    GSA is responsible for the initiation and development of Government-
wide precious metals recovery programs, and for the issuance and 
administration of applicable contracts, except those issued and 
administered by DOD for precious metals recovery and refinement 
operations. Situations will occur where, in terms of economy, 
efficiency, and environmental quality, it is in the best interest of the 
Government to recover precious metals from articles of excess and 
surplus personal property instead of using other methods of disposal. 
GSA will determine when Government-wide recovery is appropriate on the 
basis of an evaluation of the supply-demand factor, the price of the 
commodity, the cost of recovering the precious metal, and applicable 
guidelines or regulations on pollution control.


<R05>
Sec. 101-45.1002  Agency responsibilities.

    Heads of executive agencies are responsible for establishing, 
maintaining, and pursuing a program for recovery of precious metals. The 
provisions of this Sec. 101-45.1002 provide guidance with respect to 
surveys, assignments of program monitors, and internal audits. Precious 
metals that may be designated for recovery include gold, silver, and 
metals in the platinum family. Examples of silver bearing scrap and 
waste include used photographic fixing (hypo) solution, photographic and 
X-ray film, silver alloys, and dental scrap. Other examples of precious 
metals bearing materials include electronic scrap, ADPE, welding and 
brazing wire, anodes, and batteries. Certain strategic and critical 
materials may also be designated for recovery.
[62 FR 34013, June 24, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 101-45.1002-1  Precious metals recovery surveys.

    Each agency shall identify those activities that generate silver or 
other precious metals (including used hypo solution, scrap film, and 
other precious metals bearing materials). Activities identified as 
generating precious metals bearing materials shall be surveyed to obtain 
information regarding actual or potential precious metals recovery. 
Estimates of potential recovery may be obtained through use of testing 
papers for hypo solution; various charts, tables, and scales for scrap 
film, assays of samples of precious metals bearing materials; or other 
acceptable methods of estimating potential precious metals contents.

Sec. 101-45.1002-2  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 101-45.1002-3  Precious metals recovery program monitor.

    Each agency should designate an individual to monitor its precious 
metals recovery program. Responsibilities of the precious metals monitor 
should include conducting and initiating surveys; implementing and 
improving recovery procedures; and monitoring the agency's recovery 
program.
[62 FR 34013, June 24, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 101-45.1002-4  Internal audits.

    Each agency should require periodic internal audits of its precious 
metals recovery program. The internal audits should be of such frequency 
and scope as to provide for proper control over the recovery, storage, 
and disposition of precious metals bearing materials. Primary elements 
for review should include document control and record maintenance; 
storage facilities and security controls; methods of recovery and 
equipment operation; and procedures for recovering precious metals 
through service contracts or disposal through sales contracts.


<R05>
Sec. 101-45.1003  Recovery of silver from precious metals bearing materials.

    (a) Each agency should recover silver regardless of the quantity of 
used hypo solution or scrap film generated. Installations of a silver

generated or storage of

used hypo solution or scrap film until a processible quantity is 
obtained are two alternatives. If an activity generates small quantities 
of hypo solution and tests show that there is a minimal amount of silver 
per gallon of solution, arrangements should be made, to the extent 
feasible, with another activity in the area which is using a recovery 
unit to receive and process the hypo solution. When the actual amount of 
silver recovered is substantially less than the estimated amount 
potentially recoverable, agencies should fully document the reason for 
the substantial difference.
    (b) When recovery by an agency is not economically feasible and 
consolidation with other activities is not practical, the regional GSA 
Federal Supply Service Bureau serving the area or the Defense Logistics 
Agency (DLA) (in accordance with Sec. 101-45.1004) should be contacted 
for assistance. If it is determined that silver recovery cannot be 
accomplished economically by Government-owned equipment or by a 
commercial recovery contractor, the hypo solution, scrap film, or other 
silver bearing materials should be disposed of in accordance with part 
101-45 in an environmentally acceptable manner.


<R05>
Sec. 101-45.1003-1  Guidelines for the recovery of silver from used hypo solution and scrap film.

    The basic factors that determine the potential quantity of 
recoverable silver are: The amount of used hypo solution or scrap film 
generated; the amount and type of film processed; and the physical 
layout and available recovery equipment of the photographic facility. 
Since these factors may vary for each facility, a single method of 
recovery cannot be prescribed.


<R05>
Sec. 101-45.1003-2  Recovery of silver from used hypo solution.

    Used hypo solution should be processed to recover the maximum amount 
of silver from the solution, consistent with overall economic 
feasibility and environmental considerations. Recovery can be effected 
either by Government-owned equipment or through use of commercial 
recovery contracts. Various types and sizes of equipment using metallic 
replacement or electrolytic methods of recovery are available which 
permit economic silver recovery from both large and small quantities of 
used hypo solution.


<R05>
Sec. 101-45.1003-3  Recovery of silver from scrap film.

    Scrap film, the silver content of which varies according to the type 
of film and the degree of exposure, is a major source of recovered 
silver. One method of recovering silver from scrap film is by burning 
the film in specially designed and approved incinerators. The burning 
reduces the film to high content silver bearing ash which can be 
economically processed to produce fine silver. Recovery onsite by 
controlled burning should only be accomplished at those activities or 
installations where approved facilities exist and the local code on 
burning permits it. A common alternative method of recovery is through 
periodic disposal of accumulated scrap film by sale in accordance with 
part 101-45.

Sec. 101-45.1004  Recovery and use of precious metals through the DOD Precious Metals Recovery Program.

prescribed in Sec. 101-45.1004.


<R05>
Sec. 101-45.1004-1  Civil agency participation in the DOD Precious Metals Recovery Program.

    (a) Civil agencies wishing to participate in the DOD precious metals 
recovery system should contact the Manager, DOD Precious Metals Recovery 
Program, Attention: DLA-MMLC, Fort Belvoir, VA 22060, for further 
information regarding the following plans:
    (1) Plan I. An appraisal or survey of the agency's precious metals 
recovery potential and a recommendation as to appropriate recovery 
techniques and equipment;
    (2) Plan II. DLA acceptance of photographic wastes, excess, and 
other precious metals bearing materials at Defense Reutilization and 
Marketing Offices (DRMO's) or other disposition sites;
    (3) Plan III. Disposition and shipping instructions for recovered 
precious metals bearing materials not authorized for acceptance at local 
DRMO's;

[[Page 652]]

    (4) Plan IV. Assistance and recommendations as needed in the 
administration and operation of the agency's precious metals recovery 
program including an appraisal or survey of recovery potential; the 
furnishing of recovery and other supporting equipment; and the 
prescribing of procedures for the security and disposition of precious 
metals bearing materials. This plan will, in most cases, require a 
formal Memorandum of Understanding between DLA and the participating 
agency.
    (b) Services addressed in the above plans will be provided to the 
extent that DLA resources permit.
    (c) DLA will provide recovered fine precious metals to participating 
agencies (those generating precious metals bearing scrap for the DOD 
Precious Metals Recovery Program) for use as Government Furnished 
Materials (GFM) or other authorized internal uses in accordance with 
Sec. 101-45.1004-2.

<R05>
Sec. 101-45.1004-2  Use of DOD-recovered fine precious metals.

    To determine the need for recovered fine precious metals as GFM to 
reduce new procurement costs, each agency shall review procurements for 
which fine precious metals will be required by a contractor. Each agency 
having requirements for recovered fine precious metals as GFM or for 
other authorized internal uses should submit a request to the Commander, 
Defense Industrial Supply Center (DISC), Attention: DISC-OIBA/YC, 700 
Robbins Avenue, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19111-5096. Recovered fine 
precious metals will be provided to agencies for use as GFM or for other 
authorized internal uses on a ``as-needed-when-available'' basis. There 
is a nominal charge for the recovered fine precious metals. Normally, 
the amount of recovered fine precious metals authorized for issue to 
individual civil agencies will not be restricted, except in those 
instances when the precious metals involved are not available in 
sufficient quantities to satisfy all requirements. No minimum ordering 
quantity is prescribed. Requiring activities should contact DISC to 
assure asset availability prior to the requisitioning of any quantity of 
precious metal other than silver. Advance inquiries for silver should be 
made only when requirements exceed 5,000 troy ounces.

Sec. 101-45.4801  Instructions for the preparation of advance notice to the Department of Commerce.

    1. Transmittal of notice. Section 101-45.304-7 provides that when 
the acquisition cost of personal property to be sold at one time at one 
place is $250,000 or more, the disposal agency shall cause a notice of 
each such proposed sale to be transmitted to the U.S. Department of 
Commerce, room 1300, 433 West Van Buren Street, Chicago, Ill. 60607.
    The notice shall be sent at as early a date as possible in advance 
of the sale but at least 20 days prior to the date when the bids will be 
opened, or, in the case of spot bid or auction sale, when the sale will 
be conducted.

[[Page 653]]

Such notice shall be transmitted by fastest mail available and shall be 
in synopsis form suitable for printing direct from the text so 
transmitted without editing or condensing.
    These notices are for use of the Department of Commerce in making 
regular publication of a synopsis of principal proposed sales of 
Government personal property.
    2. Format and content of notice.
    a. Information to be furnished. The following information shall be 
provided in the order listed so as to preserve the format of the 
Department of Commerce publication: the name of the office which will 
issue the invitation; the name or title, address, and telephone number 
of the official from whom copies of the sales offering and other 
information can be obtained; a description of the property to be sold; 
when deemed desirable; the total estimated acquisition cost; the number 
of the invitation or sale; the date of the sale or bid opening, the 
types of sale, i.e., sealed bid, spot bid, or auction; and the 
location(s) of the property.
    b. Detailed requirements. In preparing the notice to the Department 
of Commerce, the utmost care should be exercised in describing the types 
of property to be sold in order to assure interest by the maximum number 
of potential buyers but, at the same time, condense the information so 
that minimum space in the Department of Commerce publication will be 
required for printing. While the various kinds of property to be sold 
should be stated concisely, the names of important items should not be 
omitted. The following example is provided as a guide, both as to the 
order in which the information should be given, the extent to which 
information should be condensed or expanded, depending upon the size of 
the sale, and the format which, if followed, will facilitate publication 
without editing. Attention is specially invited to the double spacing 
the ``hanging'' indention, and the length of the line which should be 
approximately 65, but not to exceed 69, character spaces.

    Source: 63 FR 5893, Feb. 5, 1998, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 101-46.000  Why should executive agencies use the exchange/sale authority?

    To reduce the agencies' need for additional funding for the 
acquisition of replacement personal property. If an agency has personal 
property that needs to be replaced, it can exchange or sell that 
property and apply the exchange allowance or sales proceeds to the 
acquisition of similar replacement property. Using the exchange/sale 
authority also enables agencies to avoid the costs (e.g., administrative 
and storage) associated with holding the property and processing it 
through the normal disposal cycle, i.e., reutilization by other Federal 
agencies, donation to eligible non-Federal public or non-profit 
organizations, sale to the public, or abandonment or destruction. By 
contrast, if the holding agency does not use the exchange/sale authority 
but instead reports the property to be replaced as excess, any sales 
proceeds are forwarded to the miscellaneous receipts account at the 
United States Treasury and are not available to the agency disposing of 
the property.


<R05>
Sec. 101-46.001  What is prescribed by this part?

    Provisions for use by you (an executive agency) when using the 
exchange/sale authority of section 201(c) of the Federal Property and 
Administrative Services Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 384, as amended (40 U.S.C. 
481(c)). This part applies to all personal property owned by executive 
agencies worldwide. For the exchange/sale of aircraft parts and 
hazardous materials, you must meet the requirements in this part and in 
parts 101-37 and 101-42 of this chapter, respectively.


<R05>
Sec. 101-46.002  What are the definitions of some of the key terms used in this part?


<R05>
Sec. 101-46.002-1  Acquire.

    To procure or otherwise obtain personal property, including by 
lease.


<R05>

    To replace personal property by trade or trade-in with the supplier 
of the replacement property.


<R05>
Sec. 101-46.002-4  Exchange/sale.

    To exchange or sell non-excess, non-surplus personal property and 
apply the exchange allowance or proceeds of sale in whole or in part 
payment for the acquisition of similar property.


<R05>
Sec. 101-46.002-5  Executive agency.

    Any executive department or independent establishment in the 
executive branch of the Government, including any wholly owned 
Government corporation.


<R05>
Sec. 101-46.002-6  Federal agency.

    Any executive agency or any establishment in the legislative or 
judicial branch of the Government (except the Senate, the House of 
Representatives, and the Architect of the Capitol and any activities 
under his/her direction).


<R05>
Sec. 101-46.002-7  Historic item.

    Property having added value for display purposes because its 
historical significance is greater than its fair market value for 
continued use. Items that are commonly available and remain in use for 
their intended purpose, such as military aircraft still in use by active 
or reserve units, are not historic items.


<R05>
Sec. 101-46.002-8  Replacement.

    The process of acquiring property to be used in place of property 
which is

[[Page 660]]

still needed but will no longer adequately perform all the tasks for 
which it is used.


<R05>
Sec. 101-46.002-9  Similar.

    Where the acquired item and replaced item:
    (a) Are identical; or
    (b) Are designed and constructed for the same purpose; or
    (c) Both constitute parts or containers for identical or similar end 
items; or
    (d) Both fall within a single Federal Supply Classification (FSC) 
group of property that is eligible for handling under the exchange/sale 
authority.


<R05>
Sec. 101-46.003  How do you request deviations from this part, and who can approve them?

    (a) General provisions for deviations from the Federal Property 
Management Regulations are found in Sec. 101-1.110 of this chapter. 
Provisions for deviations from the regulations in this part are 
presented in this section.
    (b) To request deviations from this part, you must submit a complete 
written justification to the General Services Administration (GSA), 
Office of Governmentwide Policy, Office of Transportation and Personal 
Property (MT), Washington, DC 20405. Only the Administrator of General 
Services (or designee) may grant deviations. Although the Administrator 
can approve deviations from most of the provisions in this part, he/she 
cannot approve deviations from provisions that are mandated by statute, 
i.e., the requirement at 101-46.204(b)(1) that the property exchanged or 
sold is similar to the property acquired, and the requirement at 101-
46.204(b)(2) that the property exchanged or sold is not excess or 
surplus.


<R04>
                      Subpart 101-46.1  [Reserved]


<R04>
            Subpart 101-46.2--Exchange or Sale Determination


<R05>
Sec. 101-46.200  How do you determine whether to do an exchange or a sale?

    (a) You must determine which method--exchange or sale--will provide 
the greater return for the Government. When estimating the return under 
each method, consider all administrative and overhead costs.
    (b) If the exchange allowance or estimated sales proceeds for 
property would be unreasonably low, you should process the property 
according to the regulations in Part 101-43 (Utilization of Personal 
Property) or Subpart 101-45.9 (Abandonment or Destruction of Personal 
Property) of this subchapter, as applicable.


<R05>
Sec. 101-46.201  When must you make a reimbursable transfer to another Federal agency?

    If you have property to replace which is eligible for exchange/sale, 
you should, to the maximum extent practicable, first solicit Federal 
agencies known to use or distribute such property and, if an agency 
wants it, arrange for a reimbursable transfer. Property that meets the 
replacement standards prescribed in subpart 101-25.4 of this chapter is 
not subject to this requirement.


<R05>
Sec. 101-46.202  To what other organizations may you make a reimbursable transfer?

    The Senate, the House of Representatives, the Architect of the 
Capitol and any activities under the Architect's direction, the District 
of Columbia, and mixed-ownership Government corporations.


<R05>
Sec. 101-46.203  What are the conditions for a reimbursable transfer?

    When transferring property, you must:
    (a) Do so under terms mutually agreeable to you and the recipient; 
and
    (b) Not require reimbursement of an amount greater than the 
estimated fair market value of the transferred property; and
    (c) Apply the transfer proceeds in whole or part payment for 
property acquired to replace the transferred property.


<R05>
Sec. 101-46.204  What prohibitions and necessary conditions apply to the exchange/sale of personal property?

    (a) You must not use the exchange/sale authority for:
    (1) The following FSC groups of personal property:


[[Page 661]]


10  Weapons.
11  Nuclear ordnance.
12  Fire control equipment.
14  Guided missiles.

    (6) Property which was originally acquired as excess or forfeited 
property or from another source other than new procurement, unless such 
property has been in official use by the acquiring agency for at least 1 
year. You may exchange or sell forfeited property in official use for 
less than 1 year if the head of your agency determines that a continuing 
valid requirement exists, but the specific item in use no longer meets 
that requirement, and that exchange or sale meets all other requirements 
of this part.
    (7) Property that is dangerous to public health or safety without 
first rendering such property innocuous or providing for adequate 
safeguards as part of the exchange/sale.
    (8) Combat material without demilitarizing it in accordance with 
applicable regulations.
    (9) Flight Safety Critical Aircraft Parts unless you meet the 
provisions of Sec. 101-37.610 of this chapter.
    (10) Acquisition of unauthorized replacement property.
    (11) Acquisition of replacement property which violates:
    (i) Any restriction on procurement of a commodity or commodities; or
    (ii) Any replacement policy or standard prescribed by the President, 
the Congress, or the Administrator of General Services; or
    (iii) Any contractual obligation.
    (b) You may use the exchange/sale authority only if you meet all of 
the following conditions:
    (1) The property exchanged or sold is similar to the property 
acquired; and
    (2) The property exchanged or sold is not excess or surplus, and the 
property acquired is needed for approved programs; and
    (3) The number of items acquired must equal the number of items 
exchanged or sold unless:
    (i) The item(s) acquired perform all or substantially all of the 
tasks for which the item(s) exchanged or sold would otherwise be used; 
or
    (ii) The item(s) acquired and the item(s) exchanged or sold meet the 
test for similarity specified at Sec. 101-46.002-9(iii) in that they are 
a part(s) or container(s) for identical or similar end items; and
    (4) The property exchanged or sold was not acquired for the 
principal purpose of exchange or sale; and
    (5) You document at the time of exchange or sale (or at the time of 
acquisition if it precedes the sale):
    (i) That the exchange allowance or sale proceeds will be applied to 
the acquisition of replacement property; and
    (ii) For any property exchanged or sold under this part, the 
pertinent Federal Supply Classification (FSC) Group, the number of 
items, the original acquisition cost, the exchange allowance or sales 
proceeds (as applicable), and the source from which the property was 
originally acquired i.e., new procurement, excess, forfeiture, or 
another source other than new procurement. These data, aggregated at the

sale authority.


<R05>
Sec. 101-46.205  What special exceptions apply to the exchange/sale authority?

    (a) You may exchange books and periodicals in your libraries for 
other books and periodicals, without monetary appraisal or detailed

account without regard to the FSC group or the requirement in Sec. 101-
46.204(b)(3), provided the exchange transaction is documented and 
certified by the head of your agency to be in the best interests of the 
Government and all other provisions of this part are met. The 
documentation must contain a determination that the item exchanged and 
the item acquired are historic items.


<R04>
                 Subpart 101-46.3--Exchange/Sale Methods


<R05>
Sec. 101-46.300  What are the exchange methods?

    Exchange of property may be accomplished by either of the following 
two methods:
    (a) The supplier (e.g., a Government agency, commercial or private 
organization, or an individual) delivers the replacement property to one 
of your organizational units and removes the property being replaced 
from that same organizational unit. This is the normal manner of 
exchange.
    (b) The supplier delivers the replacement property to one of your 
organizational units and removes the property being replaced from a 
different organizational unit.


<R05>
Sec. 101-46.301  What are the sales methods?

    (a) You must use the methods, terms, and conditions of sale, and the 
forms prescribed in Sec. 101-45.304 of this subchapter in the sale of 
property being replaced, except that the provisions of Sec. 101-45.304-
2(a) of this subchapter regarding negotiated sales are not applicable. 
Section 3709, Revised Statutes (41 U.S.C. 5), specifies the following 
conditions under which property being replaced can be sold by 
negotiation, subject to obtaining such competition as is feasible:
    (1) The reasonable value involved in the contract does not exceed 
$500, or
    (2) Otherwise authorized by law.
    (b) You may sell property being replaced by negotiation at fixed 
prices in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 101-45.304-2(b) of this 
subchapter.


<R05>
Sec. 101-46.302  What are the accounting requirements for the proceeds of sale?

    Except as otherwise authorized by law, you must account for proceeds 
from sales of personal property disposed of under this part in 
accordance with the General Accounting Office Policy and Procedures 
Manual for Guidance of Federal Agencies, Title 7, Fiscal Procedures, 
Section 5.5D.

<R05>
Sec. 101-47.201-1  Policy.

    It is the policy of the Administrator of General Services:
    (a) To stimulate the identification and reporting by executive 
agencies of excess real property.
    (b) To achieve the maximum utilization by executive agencies, in 
terms of economy and efficiency, of excess real property in order to 
minimize expenditures for the purchase of real property.
    (c) To provide for the transfer of excess real property among 
Federal agencies, to mixed-ownership Government corporations, and to the 
municipal government of the District of Columbia.
[29 FR 16126, Dec. 3, 1964, as amended at 42 FR 40698, Aug. 11, 1977]


<R05>
Sec. 101-47.201-2  Guidelines.

    (a) Each executive agency shall:
    (1) Survey real property under its control (including property 
assigned on a permit basis to other Federal agencies, or outleased to 
States, local governments, other public bodies, or private interests) at 
least annually to identify property which is not needed, underutilized, 
or not being put to optimum use. When other needs for the property are 
identified or recognized, the agency shall determine whether 
continuation of the current use or another Federal or other use would 
better serve the public interest, considering both the agency's needs 
and the property's location. In conducting each review, agencies shall 
be guided by Sec. 101-47.801(b), other applicable General Services 
Administration regulations, and such criteria as may be established by 
the Federal Property Council;
    (2) Maintain its inventory of real property at the absolute minimum 
consistent with economical and efficient conduct of the affairs of the 
agency; and
    (3) Promptly report to GSA real property which it has determined to 
be excess.
    (b) Each executive agency shall, so far as practicable, pursuant to 
the provisions of this subpart, fulfill its needs for real property by 
utilization of excess real property.
    (c) To preclude the acquisition by purchase of real property when 
excess or surplus property of another Federal agency may be available 
which would meet the need, each executive agency shall notify GSA of its 
needs and ascertain whether any such property is available. However, in 
specific instances where the agency's proposed acquisition of real 
property is dictated by such factors as exact geographical location, 
topography, engineering, or similar characteristics which limit the 
possible use of other available property, the notification shall not be 
required. For example, for a dam site or reservoir area or the 
construction of a generating plant or a substation specific lands are 
needed and, ordinarily, no purpose would be served by such notification.
    (d) In every case of a proposed transfer of excess real property, 
the paramount consideration shall be the validity and appropriateness of 
the requirement upon which the proposal is based.
    (1) A proposed transfer should not establish a new program of an 
executive agency which has never been reflected in any previous budget 
submission or congressional action; nor should it substantially increase 
the level of an agency's existing programs beyond that which has been 
contemplated in the President's budget or by the Congress.
    (2) Before requesting a transfer of excess real property, an 
executive agency should:
    (i) Screen the holdings of the bureaus or other organizations within 
the agency to determine whether the new requirement can be met through 
improved utilization. Any utilization, however, must be for purposes 
that are consistent with the highest and best

[[Page 668]]

use of the property under consideration; and
    (ii) Review all real property under its accountability which it has 
assigned on a permit basis to other Federal agencies, or outleased to 
States, local governments, other public bodies, or private interests and 
terminate the permit or lease for any property, or portion thereof, that 
is suitable for the proposed need whenever such termination is not 
prohibited by the terms of the permit or lease.
    (3) Property found to be available under Sec. 101-47.201-2(d)(2) (i) 
or (ii), should be utilized for the proposed need in lieu of requesting 
a transfer of excess real property. Reassignments of such property 
within the agency should be made in appropriate cases.
    (4) The appraised fair market value of the excess real property 
proposed for transfer should not substantially exceed the probable 
purchase price of other real property which would be suitable for the 
intended purpose.
    (5) The size and quantity of excess real property to be transferred 
should be limited to the actual requirements. Other portions of an 
excess installation which can be separated should be withheld from 
transfer and made available for disposal to other agencies or to the 
public.
    (6) Consideration should be given to the design, layout, geographic 
location, age, state of repair, and expected maintenance costs of excess 
real property proposed for transfer. It should be clearly demonstrated 
that the transfer will prove more economical over a sustained period of 
time than acquisition of a new facility specifically planned for the 
purpose.
    (7) Excess real property should not be permanently transferred to 
agencies for programs which appear to be scheduled for substantial 
curtailment or termination. In such cases, the property may be 
temporarily transferred on a conditional basis, with an understanding 
that the property will be released for further Federal utilization or 
disposal as surplus property, at a time agreed upon when the transfer is 
arranged (see Sec. 101-47.203-8).
    (e) Excess real property of a type which may be used for office, 
storage, and related purposes normally will be assigned by, or at the

property. To assist GSA in considering the disposal options for the 
property, agencies shall also provide to GSA any available indication of 
costs and/or time necessary to remove all or any portion of the 
asbestos-containing materials. Agencies are not required to conduct any 
specific studies and/or tests to obtain this information. (See also 
Sec. 101-47.200(b).)

place on the property during the time the property was owned by the 
United States.

    (c) There shall be transmitted with Standard Form 118:
    (1) A legible, reproducible copy of all instruments in possession of 
the agency which affect the right, title, or interest of the United 
States in the property reported or the use and operation of such

joint, or secondary jurisdiction over the lands and whether the 
Department's records show the lands to be encumbered with any existing 
valid rights or privileges under the public land laws.
    (b) Should the Department of the Interior determine that minerals in

maintenance of the property reported to GSA, the notice to the holding 
agency of the date of receipt (see Sec. 101-47.202-8) will indicate, if 
determinable, the date that the provisions of Sec. 101-47.402-2 will 
become effectivce. Normally this will be the date of the receipt of the 
report. If because of actions of the holding agency the property is not 
available for immediate disposition at the time of receipt of the 
report, the holding agency will be reminded in the notice that the 
period of its responsibility for the expense of protection and 
maintenance will be extended by the period of the delay.

Sec. 101-47.202-10  Examination for acceptability.

    Each report of excess shall be reviewed by GSA to ascertain whether 
the report was prepared in accordance with the provisions of this 
section. Within fifteen calendar days after receipt of a report, the 
holding agency shall be informed by letter of the findings of GSA.
    (a) Where it is found that a report is adequate to the extent that 
GSA can proceed with utilization and disposal actions for the property, 
the report shall be accepted and the holding agency shall be informed of 
the date of such acceptance. However, the holding agency shall, upon 
request, promptly furnish such additional information or documents 
relating to the property as may be required by GSA to accomplish a 
transfer or a disposal.
    (b) Where it is found that a report is insufficient to the extent 
that GSA would be unable to proceed with any utilization or disposal 
actions for the property, the report shall be returned and the holding 
agency shall be informed of the facts and circumstances that required 
the return of the report. The holding agency promptly shall take such 
action as may be appropriate to submit an acceptable report to GSA. 
Should the holding agency be unable to submit an acceptable report, the 
property shall be removed from under the provisions of Sec. 101-47.402-
2.

preferred location or suitable alternate locations, and describe the 
type of property needed in sufficient detail to enable GSA to review its 
records of property that it knows will be reported excess by holding 
agencies, its inventory of excess property, and its inventory of surplus 
property, to ascertain whether any such property may be suitable for the 
needs of the agency. The agency shall be informed promptly by the GSA

<R05>
Sec. 101-47.203-5  Screening of excess real property.

    Excess real property and related personal property reported by 
executive agencies shall, unless such screening is waived, be screened 
by GSA for utilization by Federal real property holding agencies (listed 
in Sec. 101-47.4907), which may reasonably be expected to have use for 
the property as follows:
    (a) Notices of availability will be submitted to each such agency 
which shall, within 30 calendar days from the date of notice, advise GSA 
if there is a firm requirement or a tentative requirement for the 
property. Agencies having tentative or firm requirements for surplus 
Federal real property for replacement housing for displaced persons, as 
authorized by section 218 of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real 
Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (84 Stat. 1902), shall review 
these notices for the additional purpose of identifying properties for 
which they may have such a requirement. When such a requirement exists, 
the agency shall so advise the appropriate GSA regional office.
    (1) In the event a tentative requirement exists, the agency shall, 
within an additional 30 calendar days, advise GSA if there is a firm 
requirement.
    (2) Within 60 calendar days after advice to GSA that a firm 
requirement exists, the agency shall furnish GSA a request for transfer 
of the property pursuant to Sec. 101-47.203-7.
    (b) Notices of availability for information of the Secretary of 
Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Education in connection 
with the exercise of the authority vested under the provisions of 
section 203(k)(1) of the Act, and for information of the Secretary of 
the Interior in connection with the exercise of the authority vested 
under the provisions of section 203(k)(2) of the Act or a possible 
determination under the provisions of section 203(k)(3) of the Act, will 
be sent to the offices designated by the Secretaries to serve the areas 
in which the

[[Page 674]]

properties are located. Similar notices of availability for information 
of the Attorney General in connection with a possible determination 
under the provisions of section 203(p)(1) of the Act, and for 
information of the Secretary of Transportation in connection with the 
exercise of the authority vested under the provisions of section 203(q) 
of the Act, will be respectively sent to the Office of Justice Programs, 
Department of Justice, and the Maritime Administration, Department of 
Transportation.
    (c) The Departments of Health and Human Services, Education, 
Interior, Justice, and Transportation shall not attempt to interest a 
local applicant in a property until it is determined surplus, except 
with the prior consent of GSA on a case-by-case basis or as otherwise 
agreed upon. When such consent is obtained, the local applicant shall be 
informed that consideration of the application is conditional upon the 
property being determined surplus to Federal requirements and made 
available for the purposes of the application. However, these 
Departments are encouraged to advise the appropriate GSA regional office 
of those excess properties which are suitable for their programs.
    (d) Concurrently with the 30-day Federal agency use screening 
period, those Federal agencies that sponsor public benefit disposals at 
less than fair market value as permitted by the statutory authorities in 
Sec. 101-47.4905 may provide the disposal agency with a recommendation, 
together with a brief supporting rationale, as illustrated in Sec. 101-
47.4909, that the highest and best use of the property is for a specific 
public benefit purpose. The recommendation may be made by the agency 
head, or designee, and will be considered by the disposal agency in its 
final highest and best use analysis and determination. After a 
determination of surplus has been made, if the disposal agency agrees 
with a sponsoring Federal agency that the highest and best use of a 
particular property is for a specific public benefit purpose, local 
public bodies will be notified that the property is available for that 
use.

Sec. 101-47.203-6  Designation as personal property.

    (a) Prefabricated movable structures such as Butler-type storage 
warehouses, quonset huts, and housetrailers (with or without 
undercarriages) reported to GSA with the land on which they are located 
may, in the discretion of GSA, be designated for disposition as personal 
property for off-site use.
    (b) Related personal property may, in the discretion of the disposal 
agency, be designated for disposition as personal property. 
Consideration of such designation shall be given particularly to items 
having possible historic or artistic value to ensure that Federal 
agencies, including the Smithsonian Institution (see Sec. 101-43.302), 
are afforded the opportunity of obtaining them through personal property 
channels for off-site use for preservation and display. Fixtures such as 
murals and fixed sculpture which have exceptional historical or artistic 
value may be designated for disposition by severance for off-site use. 
In making such designations, consideration shall be given to such 
factors as whether the severance can be accomplished without seriously 
affecting the value of the realty and whether a ready disposition can be 
made of the severed fixtures.
    (c) When a structure is to be demolished, any fixtures or related 
personal property therein may, at the discretion of the disposal agency, 
be designated for disposition as personal property where a ready 
disposition can be made of these items through such action. As indicated 
in paragraph (b) of this section, particular consideration should be 
given to designating items of possible historical or artistic value as 
personal property in such instances.

related personal property reported to GSA shall prepare and submit to 
the proper GSA regional office GSA Form 1334, Request for Transfer of 
Excess Real and Related Personal Property (Sec. 101-47.4904). 
Instructions for the preparation of GSA Form 1334 are set forth in 
Sec. 101-47.4904-1.
    (b) Upon determination by GSA that a transfer of the property 
requested is in the best interest of the Government and that the 
requesting agency is the appropriate agency to hold the property, the 
transfer may be made among Federal agencies, to mixed-ownership 
Government corporations, and to the municipal government of the District 
of Columbia.
    (c) [Reserved]
    (d) Transfers of property to executive agencies shall be made when 
the proposed land use is consistent with the policy of the Administrator 
of General Services as prescribed in Sec. 101-47.201-1 and the policy 
guidelines prescribed in Sec. 101-47.201-2. In determining whether a 
proposed transfer should be approved under the policy guidelines, GSA 
and OMB may consult informally to obtain all available data concerning 
actual program needs for the property.
    (e) GSA will execute or authorize all approved transfers to the 
requesting agency of property reported to GSA. Agencies may transfer 
without reference to GSA excess real property which is not reported to 
GSA under the provisions of Sec. 101-47.202-4(b) (1), (2), and (4). 
However, such transfers shall be made in accordance with the principles 
set forth in this section.
    (f) Pursuant to an agreement between the Director, Office of 
Management and Budget, and the Administrator of General Services, 
reimbursement for transfers of excess real property is prescribed as 
follows:
    (1) Where the transferor agency has requested the net proceeds of 
the transfer pursuant to section 204 (c) of the Act, or where either the 
transferor or transferee agency (or organizational unit affected) is 
subject to the Government Corporation Control Act (31 U.S.C. 841) or is 
a mixed-ownership Government corporation, or the municipal government of 
the District of Columbia, reimbursement for the transfer shall be in an 
amount equal to the estimated fair market value of the property 
requested as determined by the Administrator: Provided, That where the 
transferor agency is a wholly owned Government corporation, the 
reimbursement shall be either in an amount equal to the estimated fair 
market value of the property requested, or the corporation's book value 
thereof, as may be agreed upon by GSA and the corporation.
    (2) Reimbursement for all other transfers of excess real property 
shall be:
    (i) In an amount equal to 100 percent of the estimated fair market 
value of the property requested, as determined by the Administrator, or 
if the transfer is for the purpose of upgrading facilities (i.e., for 
the purpose of replacing other property of the transferee agency which 
because of the location, nature, or condition thereof, is less efficient 
for use), the reimbursement shall be in an amount equal to the 
difference between the estimated fair market value of the property to be 
replaced and the estimated fair market value of the property requested, 
as determined by the Administrator.
    (ii) Without reimbursement when the transfer is to be made under 
either of the following conditions:
    (A) Congress has specifically authorized the transfer without 
reimbursement, or
    (B) The Administrator with the approval of the Director, Office of 
Management and Budget, has approved a request for an exception from the 
100 percent reimbursement requirement.
    (1) A request for exception from the 100 percent reimbursement 
requirement shall be endorsed by the head of the executive department or 
agency requesting the exception.
    (2) A request for exception from the 100 percent reimbursement 
requirement will be submitted to GSA for referral to the Director, 
Office of Management and Budget, and shall include an explanation of how 
granting the exception would further essential agency program objectives 
and at the same time be consistent with Executive Order 12348, dated 
February 25, 1982.

[[Page 676]]

The unavailability of funds alone is not sufficient to justify an 
exception. The above required data and documentation shall be attached 
to GSA Form 1334 by the transferee agency on submission of that form to 
GSA.
    (3) If the Administrator with the approval of the Director, Office 
of Management and Budget, approves the request for an exception, the 
Administrator may then complete the transfer. A copy of the Office of 
Managment and Budget approval will be sent to the Property Review Board.
    (4) The agency requesting the exception will assume responsibility 
for protection and maintenance costs where the disposal of the property 
is deferred for more than 30 days because of the consideration of the 
request for an exception to the 100 percent reimbursement requirement.
    (g) Excess property may be transferred to the Senate, the House of 
Representatives, and the Architect of the Capitol and any activities 
under his direction, pursuant to the provisions of section 602(e) of the 
Act. The amount of reimbursement for such transfer shall be the same as 
would be required for a transfer of excess property to an executive 
agency under similar circumstances.
    (h) The transferor agency shall provide to the transferee agency all 
information held by the transferor concerning hazardous substance 
activity as outlined in Sec. 101-47.202-2.

Sec. 101-47.203-8  Temporary utilization.

    (a) Whenever GSA determines that the temporary assignment or 
reassignment to a Federal agency of any space in excess real property 
for office, storage, or related facilities would be more advantageous 
than the permanent transfer of the property to a Federal agency, it will 
execute or authorize such assignment or reassignment for such period of 
time as it shall determine. The agency to which the space is made 
available shall make appropriate reimbursement for the expense of 
maintaining such space in the absence of appropriation available to GSA 
therefor.
    (b) GSA may approve the temporary assignment or reassignment to a 
Federal agency of excess real property other than space for office, 
storage, or related facilities whenever such action would be in the best 
interest of the Government. In such cases, the agency to which the 
property is made available may be required to pay a rental or users 
charge based upon the fair value of such property, as determined by GSA. 
Where such property will be required by the agency for a period of more 
than 1 year, it may be transferred on a conditional basis, with an 
understanding that the property will be reported excess at a time agreed 
upon when the transfer is arranged (see Sec. 101-47.201-2(d)(7)).


<R05>
Sec. 101-47.203-9  Non-Federal interim use of property.

    The holding agency may, with the approval of GSA, grant rights for 
non-Federal interim use of excess property reported to GSA, or portions 
thereof, when it is determined that such interim use is not required for 
the needs of any Federal agency.


<R05>
Sec. 101-47.203-10  Withdrawals.

    Subject to the approval of GSA, and to such conditions as GSA 
considers appropriate, reports of excess real property may be withdrawn 
in whole or in part by the reporting agency at any time prior to 
transfer to another Federal agency or prior to the execution of a 
legally binding agreement for disposal as surplus property. Requests for 
withdrawals shall be addressed to the GSA regional office where the 
report of excess real property was filed.

Sec. 101-47.204-1  Reported property.

    Any real property and related personal property reported excess 
under this subpart 101-47.2 which has been screened for needs of Federal 
agencies or waived from such screening by GSA, and not been designated 
by GSA for utilization by a Federal agency, shall be subject to 
determination as surplus property by GSA.

[[Page 677]]

    (a) The holding agency, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, 
the Secretary of Education, the Secretary of the Interior, the Attorney 
General, and the Secretary of Transportation will be notified of the 
date upon which determination as surplus becomes effective. Any Federal 
agency that has identified a property as being required for replacement 
housing for displaced persons under section 218 of the Uniform 
Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 
will also be notified of the date upon which determination as surplus 
becomes effective. The Secretary of the Department of Energy will be 
notified when real property is determined surplus and advised of any 
known interest in the property for its use or development for energy 
facilities. Appropriate steps will be taken to ensure that energy site 
needs are considered along with other competing needs in the disposal of 
surplus real property, since such property may become available for use 
under sections 203(e)(3) (G) and (H) of the Act.
    (b) The notices to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the 
Secretary of Education, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Secretary 
of Energy will be sent to the offices designated by them to serve the 
area in which the property is located. The notices to the Attorney 
General will be sent to the Office of Justice Programs, Department of 
Justice. The notices to the Secretary of Transportation will be sent to 
the Maritime Administration. The notices to the Federal agencies having 
a requirement pursuant to section 218 of the Uniform Relocation 
Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 will be 
sent to the office making the request unless another office is 
designated.
    (c) With regard to surplus property which GSA predetermines will not 
be available for disposal under the above-mentioned programs, or 
whenever the holding agency has requested reimbursement of the net 
proceeds of disposition pursuant to section 204(c) of the Act, the 
notice to the affected department(s) will contain advice of such 
determination or request for reimbursement. The affected de- partment(s) 
shall not screen for potential applicants for such property.

Sec. 101-47.301-1  Policy.

    It is the policy of the Administrator of General Services:
    (a) That surplus real property shall be disposed of in the most 
economical manner consistent with the best interests of the Government.
    (b) That surplus real property shall ordinarily be disposed of for 
cash consistent with the best interests of the Government.
    (c) That surplus real property shall be disposed of by exchange for 
privately owned property only for property management considerations 
such as boundary realignment or provision of access or in those 
situations in which the acquisition is authorized by law, the requesting 
Federal agency has received approval from the Office of

committees to acquire by exchange, and the transaction offers 
substantial economic or unique program advantages not otherwise 
obtainable by any other method of acquisition.

Sec. 101-47.301-2  Applicability of antitrust laws.

    (a) In any case in which there is contemplated a disposal to any 
private interest of real and related personal property which has an 
estimated fair market value of $3,000,000 or more, or of patents, 
processes, techniques, or inventions, irrespective of cost, the disposal 
agency shall transmit promptly to the Attorney General notice of any 
such proposed disposal and the probable terms or conditions thereof, as 
required by section 207 of the Act, for his advice as to whether the 
proposed disposal would tend to create or maintain a situation 
inconsistent with antitrust laws, and no such real property shall be 
disposed of until such advice has been received. If such notice is given 
by any executive agency other than GSA, a copy of the notice shall be 
transmitted simultaneously to the office of GSA for the region in which 
the property is located.
    (b) Upon request of the Attorney General, GSA or any other executive 
agency shall furnish or cause to be furnished such information as it may 
possess which the Attorney General determines to be appropriate or 
necessary to enable him to give the requested advice or to determine 
whether any other disposition or proposed disposition of surplus real 
property violates or would violate any of the antitrust laws.

    Pursuant to section 602(c) of the act, disposals of real property 
shall not be made under other laws but shall be made only in strict 
accordance with the provisions of this subpart 101-47.3 unless the 
Administrator of General Services, upon written application by the 
disposal agency, shall determine in each case that the provisions of any 
such other law, pursuant to which disposal is proposed to be made, are 
not inconsistent with the authority conferred by this Act. The 
provisions of this section shall not apply to disposals of real property 
authorized to be made by section 602(d) of the act or by any special 
statute which directs or requires an executive agency named therein to 
transfer or convey specifically described real property in accordance 
with the provisions of such statute.

and manage the credit lease, or permit and any security therefor and may 
enforce, adjust, or settle any right of the Government with respect 
thereto in such manner and upon such terms as that agency considers to 
be in the best interests of the Government.

Sec. 101-47.302-2  Holding agency.

    (a) The holding agency is hereby designated as disposal agency for:
    (1) Leases, permits, licenses, easements, and similar real estate 
interests held by the Government in non-Government-owned property 
(including Government-owned improvements located on the premises), 
except when it is determined by either the holding agency or GSA that 
the Government's

[[Page 679]]

interest will be best served by the disposal of such real estate 
interests together with other property owned or controlled by the 
Government, that has been or is being reported to GSA as excess; and
    (2) Fixtures, structures, and improvements of any kind to be 
disposed of without the underlying land with the exception of 
Government-owned machinery and equipment, which are fixtures being used 
by a contractor-operator, where such machinery and equipment will be 
sold to the contractor-operator.
    (3) Standing timber and embedded gravel, sand, stone and underground 
water to be disposed of without the underlying land.
    (b) GSA may act as the disposal agency for the type of property 
described in paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section, whenever 
requested by the holding agency to perform the disposal functions. Where 
GSA acts as the disposal agency for the disposal of leases and similar 
real estate interests as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, 
the holding agency nevertheless shall continue to be responsible for the 
payment of the rental until the lease is terminated and for the payment 
of any restoration or other direct costs incurred by the Government as 
an incident to the termination. Likewise, where GSA acts as disposal 
agency for the disposal of fixtures, structures, and improvements as 
described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the holding agency 
nevertheless shall continue to be responsible for payment of any 
demolition and removal costs not offset by the sale of the property.

instances.

Sec. 101-47.303  Responsibility of disposal agency.


<R05>
Sec. 101-47.303-1  Classification.

    Each surplus property, or, if the property is subdivided, each unit 
of property shall be classified by the disposal agency to determine the 
methods and conditions applicable to the disposal of the property. 
Classification shall be according to the estimated highest and best use 
for the property. The property may be reclassified from time to time by 
the disposal agency or by GSA whenever such action is deemed 
appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 101-47.303-2  Disposals to public agencies.

    The disposal agency shall comply with the provisions of Executive 
Order 12372 and 41 CFR subpart 101-6.21, which enables a State to 
establish the single point of contact process or other appropriate 
procedures to review and comment on the compatibility of a proposed 
disposal with State, regional and local development plans and programs. 
When a single point of contact transmits a State review process 
recommendation, the Federal agency receiving the recommendation must 
either accept the recommendation; reach a mutually agreeable solution 
with the party(s) preparing the recommendation; or provide the single 
point of contact with a written explanation for not accepting the 
recommendation or reaching a mutually agreeable solution. If there is 
nonaccommodation, the agency is generally required to wait 10 calendar 
days after receipt, by the single point of contact, of an explanation 
before taking final action. The single point of contact is presumed to 
have received written notification 5 calendar days after the date of 
mailing of such notification. The 10-day waiting period may be waived if 
the agency determines that because of unusual circumstances this delay 
is not feasible.
    (a) Whenever property is determined to be surplus, the disposal 
agency shall, on the basis of the information given in Sec. 101-47.4905, 
list the public agencies eligible under the provisions of the statutes 
referred to above to procure the property or portions thereof,

[[Page 680]]

except that such listing need not be made with respect to:
    (1) Any such property when the determination of the property as 
surplus is conditioned upon disposal limitations which would be 
inconsistent with disposal under the statutes authorizing disposal to 
eligible public agencies; or
    (2) Any such property having an estimated fair market value of less 
than $1,000 except where the disposal agency has any reason to believe 
that an eligible public agency may be interested in the property.
    (b) Before public advertising, negotiation, or other disposal 
action, the disposal agency shall give notice to eligible public 
agencies that the property has been determined surplus. Surplus real 
property may be procured by public agencies under the statutes cited in 
Sec. 101-47.4905. A notice to public agencies of surplus determination 
shall be prepared following the sample shown in Sec. 101-47.4906. This 
notice shall be transmitted by a letter prepared following the sample 
shown in Sec. 101-47.4906-1. A copy of this notice shall also be sent 
simultaneously to the State single point of contact, under a covering 
letter prepared following the sample shown in Sec. 101-47.4906-2. The 
point of contact shall be advised that no final disposal action will be 
taken for 60 calendar days from the date of notification to allow time 
for the point of contact to provide any desired comments. The disposal 
agency will wait the full 60 calendar days, even if the comments are 
received early, to allow time for the point of contact to send 
additional or revised comments.
    (1) Notice for property located in a State shall be given to the 
Governor of the State, to the county clerk or other appropriate 
officials of the county in which the property is located, to the mayor 
or other appropriate officials of the city or town in which the property 
is located, to the head of any other local governmental body known to be 
interested in and eligible to acquire the property, and to the point of 
contact established by the State or under other appropriate procedures 
established by the State.
    (2) Notice for property located in the District of Columbia shall be 
given to the Mayor of the District of Columbia and to the point of 
contact established by the District of Columbia or under other 
appropriate procedures established by the District of Columbia.
    (3) Notice for property located in the Virgin Islands shall be given 
to the Governor of the Virgin Islands and to the point of contact 
established by the Virgin Islands or under other appropriate procedures 
established by the Virgin Islands.
    (4) Notice for property located in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico 
shall be given to the Governor of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and to 
the point of contact established by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or 
under other appropriate procedures established by the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico.
    (c) The notice prepared pursuant to Sec. 101-47.303-2(b) shall also 
be posted in the post office which serves the area in which the property 
is located and in other prominent places such as the State capitol 
building, county building, courthouse, town hall, or city hall. The 
notice to be posted in the post office shall be mailed to the postmaster 
with a request that it be posted. Arrangements for the posting of the 
notice in other prominent places shall be as provided for in the 
transmittal letters (see Sec. 101-47.4906-1) to eligible public 
agencies.
    (d) A copy of the notice described in paragraph (b) of this section 
shall be furnished to the appropriate regional or field offices of (1) 
the National Park Service (NPS) and the Fish and Wildlife Service of the 
Department of the Interior and (2) the Federal Aviation Administration, 
the Federal Highway Administration, and the Maritime Administration of 
the Department of Transportation concerned with the disposal of property 
to public agencies under the statutes named in the notice.
    (e) In the case of property which may be made available for 
assignment to the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), the 
Secretary of Education (ED) or the Secretary of the Interior for 
disposal under sections 203(k)(1) or (k)(2) of the Act:
    (1) The disposal agency shall inform the appropriate offices of HHS, 
ED or the NPS 3 workdays in advance of the date the notice will be given 
to public agencies, to permit similar notice to be

[[Page 681]]

given simultaneously by HHS, ED or NPS to additional interested public 
bodies. HHS and ED shall furnish notice to eligible nonprofit 
institutions.
    (2) The disposal agency shall furnish the Departments with a copy of 
the postdated transmittal letter addressed to each public agency, copies 
(not to exceed 25) of the postdated notice, and a copy of the holding 
agency's Report of Excess Real Property (Standard Form 118, with 
accompanying schedules).
    (3) As of the date of the transmittal letter and notice to public 
agencies, the Departments may proceed with their screening functions for 
any potential applicants and thereafter may make their determinations of 
need and receive applications.
    (f) If the disposal agency is not informed within the 29-calendar-
day period provided in the notice of the desire of a public agency to 
acquire the property under the provisions of the statutes listed in 
Sec. 101-47.4905, or is not notified by ED or HHS of a potential 
educational or public health requirement, or is not notified by the 
Department of the Interior of a potential park or recreation 
requirement, or is not notified by the Department of Justice (DOJ) of a 
potential correctional facilities use, or is not notified by the 
Department of Transportation (DOT) of a potential port facility use; it 
shall be assumed that no public agency or nonprofit institution desires 
to procure the property. (The requirements of this Sec. 101-47.303-2(f) 
shall not apply to the procedures for making Federal surplus real 
property available to assist the homeless in accordance with Section 501 
of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act, as amended (42 
U.S.C. 11411).)
    (g) The disposal agency shall promptly review each response of a 
public agency to the notice given pursuant to paragraph (b) of this 
section. The disposal agency shall determine what constitutes a 
reasonable period of time to allow the public agency to develop and 
submit a formal application for the property or its comments as to the 
compatibility of the disposal with its development plans and programs. 
When making such determination, the disposal agency shall give 
consideration to the potential suitability of the property for the use 
proposed, the length of time the public agency has stated it will 
require for its action, the protection and maintenance costs to the 
Government during such length of time, and any other relevant facts and 
circumstances. The disposal agency shall coordinate such review and 
determination with the proper office of any interested Federal agencies 
listed below:
    (1) National Park Service, Department of the Interior;
    (2) Department of Health and Human Services;
    (3) Department of Education;
    (4) Federal Aviation Administration, Department of Transportation;
    (5) Fish and Wildlife Service, Department of the Interior;
    (6) Federal Highway Administration, Department of Transportation;
    (7) Office of Justice Programs, Department of Justice; and
    (8) Maritime Administration, Department of Transportation.
    (h) When the disposal agency has made a determination as to what 
constitutes a reasonable period of time to develop and submit a formal 
application, the public agency shall be so notified. The public agency 
shall be advised of the information required in connection with an 
application to procure the property.
    (i) Upon receipt of the formal application for the property, the 
disposal agency shall consider and act upon it in accordance with the 
provisions of the statute and applicable regulations. If comments are 
received indicating that the disposal is incompatible with State, 
regional, or local development plans and programs, the disposal agency 
shall attempt to resolve the differences consistent with its statutory 
responsibilities in the disposal of surplus property.

the head of the local governmental unit having jurisdiction over zoning 
and land use regulation in the area shall be accompanied by a copy of 
section 803 of the Act (see Sec. 101-47.4906a) and the transmittal 
letter in such instances shall include an additional paragraph 
requesting information concerning zoning as set forth in Sec. 101-
47.4906b.
    (b) Information which is furnished by the unit of general local 
government pursuant to the action taken in paragraph (a) of this section 
shall be included in Invitations for Bid in advertised sales. In 
negotiated sales, this information shall be presented to prospective 
purchasers during the course of the negotiations and shall be included 
in the sales agreements. In either instance, this information shall be 
followed by a written statement, substantially as follows:

    The above information was obtained from ____________________ and is 
furnished pursuant to section 803 of the Federal Property and 
Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended. The Government does not 
guarantee that the information is necessarily accurate or will remain 
unchanged. Any inaccuracies or changes in the above information shall 
not be cause for adjustment or rescission of any contract resulting from 
this Invitation for Bid or Sales Agreement.

    (c) If no response to a request for such zoning information is 
received, the property may be offered for sale without furnishing such 
information to prospective purchasers. If the unit of general local 
government notifies the disposal agency of its desire to zone the 
property, it shall be afforded a 30-calendar-day period (in addition to 
the 20-calendar days afforded in the notice of surplus determination) to 
issue such zoning regulations. If the zoning cannot be accomplished 
within this time frame, the sale may proceed but the prospective 
purchasers shall be advised of the pending zoning of the property.

Sec. 101-47.303-4  Appraisal.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in this subpart 101-47.3, the 
disposal agency shall in all cases obtain, as appropriate, an appraisal 
of either the fair market value or the fair annual rental value of 
property available for disposal.
    (b) No appraisal need be obtained. (1) When the property is to be 
disposed of without monetary consideration, or at a fixed price, or
    (2) When the estimated fair market value of property to be offered 
on a competitive sale basis does not exceed $50,000;

Provided, however, That the exception in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section shall not apply to disposals that take any public benefit 
purpose into consideration in fixing the sale value of the property.
    (c) The disposal agency shall have the property appraised by 
experienced and qualified persons familiar with the types of property to 
be appraised by them. Any person engaged to collect or evaluate 
information pursuant to this subsection shall certify that he has no 
interest, direct or indirect, in the property which would conflict in 
any manner with the preparation and submission of an impartial appraisal 
report.

Sec. 101-47.304-2  Soliciting cooperation of local groups.

<R05>
Sec. 101-47.304-3  Information to interested persons.

    The disposal agency shall, upon request, supply to bona fide 
potential purchasers and lessees adequate preliminary information, and, 
with the cooperation of the holding agency where necessary, shall render 
such assistance to such persons as may enable them, insofar as feasible, 
to obtain adequate information regarding the property. The disposal 
agency shall establish procedures so that all persons showing due 
diligence are given full and complete opportunity to make an offer.


<R05>
Sec. 101-47.304-4  Invitation for offers.

    In all advertised and negotiated disposals, the disposal agency 
shall prepare and furnish to all prospective purchasers or lessees 
written invitations to make an offer, which shall contain or incorporate 
by reference all the terms and conditions under which the property is 
offered for disposal, including all provisions required by statute to be 
made a part of the offer. The invitation shall further specify the form 
of the disposal instrument, which specifications shall be in accordance 
with the appropriate provisions of Secs. 101-47.307-1 and 101-47.307-2.
    (a) When the disposal agency has determined that the sale of 
specific property on credit terms is necessary to avoid retarding the 
salability of the property and the price obtainable, the invitation 
shall provide for submission of offers on the following terms:
    (1) Offers to purchase of less than $2,500 shall be for cash.
    (2) When the purchase price is $2,500 or more but less than $10,000, 
a cash downpayment of not less than 25 percent shall be required with 
the balance due in 8 years or less.
    (3) When the purchase price is $10,000 or more, a cash downpayment 
of not less than 20 percent shall be required with the balance due in 10 
years or less.
    (4) The purchaser shall furnish a promissory note secured by the 
purchase money mortgage or deed of trust on the property, whichever the 
Government determines to be appropriate.
    (5) Payment will be in equal quarter-annual installments of the 
principal together with interest on the unpaid balance.
    (6) Interest on the unpaid balance will be at the General Services 
Administration's established interest rate.
    (b) Where the disposal agency has determined that an offering of the 
property on credit terms that do not meet the standards set forth in 
Sec. 101-47.304-4(a) is essential to permit disposal of the property in 
the best interests of the Government, the invitation may provide for 
submission of offers on such alternate terms of payment as may be 
recommended by the disposal agency and approved by the Administrator of 
General Services on the basis of a detailed written statement justifying 
the need to deviate from the standard terms. The justification shall be 
based on the needs of the Federal Government as distinguished from the 
interests of the purchaser. The sale in those cases where the 
downpayment is less than 20 percent shall, unless otherwise authorized 
by the Administrator of General Services, be under a land contract which 
shall provide, in effect, for conveyance of title to the purchaser by 
quitclaim deed or other form of conveyance in accordance with the 
appropriate provisions of Secs. 101-47.307-1 and 101-47.307-2 upon 
payment of one-third of the total purchase price and accrued interest, 
or earlier if the Government so elects, and execution and delivery of 
purchaser's note and purchase money mortgage (or bond and deed of trust) 
satisfactory to the Government, to secure payment of the unpaid balance 
of the purchase price.
    (c) The disposal agency may increase the cash downpayment 
requirement or shorten the period of amortization whenever circumstances 
warrant and

[[Page 684]]

in the case of sales of farms, may provide for payment of the unpaid 
balance on equal semiannual or annual installment basis.
    (d) Where a sale is to be made on credit, the invitation shall 
provide that the purchaser agrees by appropriate provisions to be 
incorporated in the disposal instruments that he will not lease (unless 
the property was offered without leasing restrictions by the Government) 
or sell the property, or any part thereof or interest therein, without 
prior written authorization of the Government.
    (1) In appropriate cases, except as provided in Sec. 101-47.304-
4(d)(2), the invitation shall state that the disposal instrument may 
include provisions specifically authorizing leasing and/or resale and 
release of portions of the property as desired by the purchaser, 
provided that such provisions shall, in the judgment of the Government, 
be adequate to protect its security for the credit extended to the 
purchaser.
    (2) In the case of timber or mineral lands, or lands containing 
other saleable products, the invitation shall state that the disposal 
instrument may specifically provide for granting future partial releases 
to permit the resale of timber, minerals, and other saleable products, 
or authorize the leasing of mineral rights, upon payment to the 
Government of such amounts as may be required by the Government but not 
less than the proceeds of any sale or lease less such amounts as may be 
determined by the Government to represent the cost of the sale or lease.
    (3) All payments for such authorizations and/or releases shall, at 
the option of the Government, be applied against the unpaid balance of 
the indebtedness in inverse order of its maturity, or upon any 
delinquent installments of principal and interest, or used for payments 
of any delinquent taxes or insurance premiums.
    (e) Where property is offered for disposal under a land contract or 
lease, the terms and conditions contained in the invitation shall 
provide that the purchaser or lessee will be required to pay to the 
proper taxing authorities or to the disposal agency, as may be directed, 
all taxes, payments in lieu of taxes (in the event of the existence or 
subsequent enactment of legislation authorizing such payments), 
assessments or similar charges which may be assessed or imposed on the 
property, or upon the occupier thereof, or upon the use or operation of 
the property and to assume all costs of operating obligations.
    (f) Whenever property is offered for sale on credit terms or for 
lease, the terms and conditions contained in the invitation shall 
provide that the purchaser or lessee shall procure and maintain at his 
expense during the term credit is extended, or the period of the lease, 
such insurance in such amounts as may be required by the Government; 
required insurance shall be in companies acceptable to the Government 
and shall include such terms and provisions as may be required to 
provide coverage satisfactory to the Government.

except as provided in Secs. 101-47.304-9 and 101-47.304-10, shall be 
made after publicly advertising for bids.
    (1) The advertising for bids shall be made at such time previous to 
the disposal or contract, through such methods and on such terms and 
conditions as shall permit that full and free competition which is 
consistent with the value and nature of the property involved. The 
advertisement shall designate the place to which the bids are to be 
delivered or mailed, and shall state the place, date, and time of public 
opening.
    (2) All bids shall be publicly disclosed at the time and place 
stated in the advertisement.
    (3) Award shall be made with reasonable promptness by notice to the 
responsible bidder whose bid, conforming to the invitation for bids, 
will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors 
considered: Provided, That all bids may be rejected when it is in the 
public interest to do so.
    (b) Disposal and contracts for disposal of surplus property may be 
made through contract auctioneers when authorized by GSA. The auctioneer 
retained under contract shall be required to publicly advertise for bids 
in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Sec. 101-47.304-7.


<R05>
Sec. 101-47.304-8  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 101-47.304-9  Negotiated disposals.

    (a) Disposal agencies shall obtain such competition as is feasible 
under the circumstances in all negotiations of disposals and contracts 
for disposal of surplus property. They may dispose of surplus property 
by negotiation only in the following situations:
    (1) When the estimated fair market value of the property involved 
does not exceed $15,000;
    (2) When bid prices after advertising therefor are not reasonable 
(either as to all or some part of the property) or have not been 
independently arrived at in open competition;
    (3) When the character or conditions of the property or unusual 
circumstances make it impractical to advertise publicly for competitive 
bids and the fair market value of the property and other satisfactory 
terms of disposal can be obtained by negotiation;
    (4) When the disposals will be to States, Commonwealth of Puerto 
Rico, possessions, political subdivisions thereof, or tax-supported 
agencies therein, and the estimated fair market value of the property 
and other satisfactory terms of disposal are obtained by negotiation; or
    (5) When negotiation is otherwise authorized by the Act or other 
law, such as:
    (i) Disposals of power transmission lines for public or cooperative 
power projects (see Sec. 101-47.308-1).
    (ii) Disposals for public airport utilization (see Sec. 101-47.308-
2).
    (b) Appraisal data required pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 101-
47.303-4, when needed for the purpose of conducting negotiations under 
Sec. 101-47.304-9(a) (3), (4), or (5)(i) shall be obtained under 
contractual arrangements with experienced and qualified real estate 
appraisers familiar with the types of property to be appraised by them: 
Provided, however, That in any case where the cost of obtaining such 
data from a contract appraiser would be out of proportion to the 
expected recoverable value of the property, or if for any other reason 
employing a contract appraiser would not be in the best interest of the 
Government, the head of the disposal agency or his designee should 
authorize any other method of obtaining an estimate of the fair market 
value of the property or the fair annual rental he may deem to be 
proper.
    (c) Negotiated sales to public bodies under 40 U.S.C. 484(e)(3)(H) 
will be considered only when the disposal agency has made a 
determination that a public benefit will result from the negotiated sale 
which would not be realized from a competitive sale disposal. The offer 
to purchase and the conveyance document concerning such negotiated sales 
shall contain an excess profits covenant. A standard Excess Profits 
Covenant for Negotiated Sales to Public Bodies is illustrated in 
Sec. 101-47.4908. The standard

[[Page 686]]

covenant is provided as a guide, and appropriate modifications may be 
made provided that its basic purpose is retained. The disposal agency 
shall monitor the property involved and inspect records related thereto 
as necessary to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the 
sale and may take any actions which it deems reasonable and prudent to 
recover any excess profits realized through the resale of the property.
    (d) The annual report of the Administrator under section 212 of the 
Act shall contain or be accompanied by a listing and description of any 
negotiated disposals of surplus real property having an estimated fair 
market value of over $15,000, other than disposals for which an 
explanatory statement has been transmitted under Sec. 101-47.304-12.

retained under contracts shall be required to give wide public notice of 
availability of the property for disposal.

documentation in the files of the agency.

Sec. 101-47.304-12  Explanatory statements.

    (a) Subject to the exception stated in Sec. 101-47.304-12(b), the 
disposal agency shall prepare an explanatory statement, as required by 
section 203(e)(6) of the Act, of the circumstances of each of the 
following proposed disposals by negotiation:
    (1) Any real property that has an estimated fair market value in 
excess of $100,000, except that any real property disposed of by lease 
or exchange shall only be subject to paragraphs (a) (2) through (4) of 
this section;
    (2) Any real property disposed of by lease for a term of 5 years or 
less; if the estimated fair annual rent is in excess of $100,000 for any 
of such years;
    (3) Any real property disposed of by lease for a term of more than 5 
years, if the total estimated rent over the term of the lease is in 
excess of $100,000; or
    (4) Any real property or real and related personal property disposed 
of by exchange, regardless of value, or any property any part of the 
consideration for which is real property.
    (b) No explanatory statement need be prepared for a disposal of 
property authorized to be disposed of without advertising by any 
provision of law other than section 203(e) of the Act.
    (c) An outline for the preparation of the explanatory statement is 
shown in Sec. 101-47.4911. A copy of the statement shall be preserved in 
the files of the disposal agency.
    (d) Each explanatory statement when prepared shall be submitted to 
the Administrator of General Services for review and transmittal by the 
Administrator of General Services by letters to the Committees on 
Government Operations and any other appropriate committees of the Senate 
and House of Representatives. The submission to the Administrator of 
General Services shall include such supporting data as may be relevant 
and necessary for evaluating the proposed action.
    (e) Copies of the Administrator of General Services' transmittal 
letters to the committees of the Congress, Sec. 101-47.304-12(d), will 
be furnished to the disposal agency.
    (f) In the absence of adverse comment by an appropriate committee or 
subcommittee of the Congress on the proposed negotiated disposal, the 
disposal agency may consummate the sale on or after 35 days from the 
date of the Administrator of General Services letters transmitting the 
explanatory statement to the committees.

Sec. 101-47.304-13  Provisions relating to asbestos.

    Where the existence of asbestos on the property has been brought to 
the attention of the disposal agency by the Standard Form 118 
information provided in accordance with Sec. 101-47.202-2)(b)(9), the 
disposal agency shall incorporate such information (less any cost or 
time estimates to remove the asbestos-containing materials) in any 
Invitation for Bids/Offers to Purchase and include the following:

              Notice of the Presence of Asbestos--Warning!

    (a) The Purchaser is warned that the property offered for sale 
contains asbestos-containing materials. Unprotected or unregulated 
exposures to asbestos in product manufacturing, shipyard, and building 
construction workplaces have been associated with asbestos-related 
diseases. Both the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 
and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulate asbestos because 
of the potential hazards associated with exposure to airborne asbestos 
fibers. Both OSHA and EPA have determined that such exposure increases 
the risk of asbestos-related diseases, which include certain cancers and 
which can result in disability or death.
    (b) Bidders (Offerors) are invited, urged and cautioned to inspect 
the property to be sold prior to submitting a bid (offer). More 
particularly, bidders (offerors) are invited, urged and cautioned to 
inspect the property as to its asbestos content and condition and any 
hazardous or environmental conditions relating thereto. The disposal 
agency will assist bidders (offerors) in obtaining any authorization(s) 
which may be required in order to carry out any such inspection(s). 
Bidders (Offerors) shall be deemed to have relied solely on their own 
judgment in assessing the overall condition of all or any portion of the 
property including, without limitation, any asbestos hazards or 
concerns.
    (c) No warranties either express or implied are given with regard to 
the condition of the property including, without limitation, whether the 
property does or does not contain asbestos or is or is not safe for a 
particular purpose. The failure of any bidder (offeror) to inspect, or 
to be fully informed as to the condition of all or any portion of the 
property offered, will not constitute grounds for any claim or demand 
for adjustment or withdrawal of a bid or offer after its opening or 
tender.
    (d) The description of the property set forth in the Invitation for 
Bids (Offer to Purchase) and any other information provided therein with 
respect to said property is based on the best information available to 
the disposal agency and is believed to be correct, but an error or 
omission, including but not limited to the omission of any information 
available to the agency having custody over the property and/or any 
other Federal agency, shall not constitute grounds or reason for 
nonperformance of the contract of sale, or any claim by the Purchaser 
against the Government including, without limitation, any claim for 
allowance, refund, or deduction from the purchase price.
    (e) The Government assumes no liability for damages for personal 
injury, illness, disability or death, to the Purchaser, or to the 
Purchaser's successors, assigns, employees, invitees, or any other 
person subject to Purchaser's control or direction, or to any other 
person, including members of the general public, arising from or 
incident to the purchase, transportation, removal, handling, use, 
disposition, or other activity causing or leading to contact of any kind 
whatsoever with asbestos on the property which is the subject of this 
sale, whether the Purchaser, its successors or assigns has or have 
properly warned or failed properly to warn the individual(s) injured.
    (f) The Purchaser further agrees that in its use and occupancy of 
the property it will comply with all Federal, state, and local laws 
relating to asbestos.

Sec. 101-47.304-14  Provisions relating to hazardous substance activity.

    (a) Where the existence of hazardous substance activity has been 
brought to the attention of the disposal agency by the Standard Form 118 
information provided in accordance with Sec. 101-47.202-2(b)(10), the 
disposal agency shall incorporate such information into any Invitation 
for Bids/Offers to Purchase and include the following statements:

    Notice regarding hazardous substance activity:
    The information contained in this notice is required under the 
authority of regulations promulgated under section 120(h) of the 
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act 
(CERCLA or ``Superfund''), 42 U.S.C. section 9620(h).
    The (holding agency) advises that (provide information on the type 
and quantity of hazardous substances; the time at which storage, 
release, or disposal took place; and a description of the remedial 
action taken).
    All remedial action necessary to protect human health and the 
environment with respect to the hazardous substance activity during the 
time the property was owned by

[[Page 688]]

the United States has been taken. Any additional remedial action found 
to be necessary shall be conducted by the United States.

    (b) In the case where the purchaser is a potentially responsible 
party (PRP) with respect to the hazardous substance activity, the above 
statements must be modified as appropriate to properly represent the 
liability of the PRP for any remedial action.

<R05>
Sec. 101-47.305-1  General.

    (a) When the head of the disposal agency or his designee determines 
that bid prices (either as to all or some part of the property) received 
after advertising therefor or received in response to the action 
authorized in paragraph (b) of this Sec. 101-47.305-1, are reasonable, 
i.e., commensurate with the fair market value of the property, and were 
independently arrived at in open competition, award shall be made with 
reasonable promptness by notice to the bidder whose bid, conforming to 
the invitation for bids, will be most advantageous to the Government, 
price and other factors considered. Any or all offers may be rejected 
when the head of the disposal agency or his designee determines it is in 
the public interest to do so.
    (b) Where the advertising does not result in the receipt of a bid at 
a price commensurate with the fair market value of the property, the 
highest bidder may, at the discretion of the head of the disposal agency 
or his designee and upon determination of responsiveness and bidder 
responsibility, be afforded an opportunity to increase his offered 
price. The bidder shall be given a reasonable period of time, not to 
exceed fifteen working days, to respond. At the time the bidder is 
afforded an opportunity to increase his bid, all other bids shall be 
rejected and bid deposits returned. Any sale at a price so increased may 
be concluded without regard to the provisions of Sec. 101-47.304-9 and 
Sec. 101-47.304-12.
    (c) The disposal agency shall allow a reasonable period of time 
within which the successful bidder shall consummate the transaction and 
shall notify the successful bidder of the period allowed.
    (d) It is within the discretion of the head of the disposal agency 
or his designee to determine whether the procedure authorized by 
paragraph (b) of this Sec. 101-47.305-1 is followed or whether the bids 
shall be rejected and the property reoffered for sale on a publicly 
advertised competitive bid basis in accordance with the provisions of 
Sec. 101-47.304-7, or disposed of by negotiation pursuant to Sec. 101-
47.306-1, or offered for disposal under other applicable provisions of 
this subpart 101-47.3.

Sec. 101-47.305-2  Equal offers.

    Equal offers means two or more offers that are equal in all 
respects, taking into consideration the best interests of the 
Government. If equal acceptable offers are received for the same 
property, award shall be made by a drawing by lot limited to the equal 
acceptable offers received.


<R05>
Sec. 101-47.305-3  Notice to unsuccessful bidders.

    When an offer for surplus real property has been accepted, the

return their earnest money deposits, if any.


<R05>
Sec. 101-47.306  Absence of acceptable offers.


<R05>
Sec. 101-47.306-1  Negotiations.

    (a) When the head of the disposal agency or his designee determines 
that bid prices after advertising therefor (including the action 
authorized by the provisions of Sec. 101-47.305-1(b)) are not reasonable 
either as to all or some part of the property or were not independently 
arrived at in open competition and that a negotiated sale rather than a 
disposal by readvertising or under other applicable provisions of this 
subpart would better protect the public interest, the property or such 
part thereof may be disposed of by negotiated sale after rejection of 
all bids received: Provided, That no negotiated disposal may be made 
under this Sec. 101-47.306-1 unless:
    (1) Notification of the intention to negotiate and reasonable 
opportunity to negotiate shall have been given by

[[Page 689]]

the agency head or his designee to each responsible bidder who submitted 
a bid pursuant to the advertising;
    (2) The negotiated price is higher than the highest rejected bid 
price offered by any responsible bidder, as determined by the head of 
the agency or his designee; and
    (3) The negotiated price is the highest negotiated price offered by 
any responsible prospective purchaser.
    (b) Any such negotiated disposal shall be subject to the applicable 
provisions of Secs. 101-47.304-9 and 101-47.304-12.


<R05>
Sec. 101-47.306-2  Defense Industrial Reserve properties.

    In the event that any disposal agency is unable to dispose of any 
surplus industrial plant because of the application of the conditions 
and restrictions of the National Security Clause imposed under the

practicable effort to do so, it shall notify the Secretary of Defense, 
indicating such modifications in the National Security Clause, if any, 
which in its judgment will make possible the disposal of the plant. Upon 
agreement by the Secretary of Defense to any or all of such 
modifications, the plant shall be reoffered for disposal subject to such 
modifications as may have been so agreed upon; or if such modifications 
are not agreed to, and upon request of the Secretary of Defense, the 
plant shall be transferred to the custody of GSA.

Sec. 101-47.307-2  Conditions in disposal instruments.

    (a) Where a sale is made upon credit, the purchaser shall agree by 
appropriate provisions to be incorporated in the disposal intruments, 
that he will not resell or lease (unless due to its character or type 
the property was offered without leasing restrictions by the disposal 
agency) the property, or any part thereof or interest therein, without 
the prior written authorization of the disposal agency and such disposal 
instruments in appropriate cases may specifically provide for such 
authorization and/or future partial releases to be granted on terms 
which will adequately protect the Government's security for the credit 
extended to the purchaser.
    (b) Except for exchange transactions initiated by the Federal 
Government for its own benefit, any disposition of land, or land and 
improvements located thereon, to public bodies by negotiation pursuant

instrument a covenant substantially as follows:

    The Grantee covenants for itself, its heirs, successors, and assigns

part thereof, that the said Grantee and such heirs, successors, and 
assigns shall not discriminate upon the basis of race, color, religion, 
or national origin in the use, occupancy, sale, or lease of the 
property, or in their employment practices conducted thereon. This 
covenant shall not apply, however, to the lease or rental of a room or 
rooms within a family dwelling unit; nor shall it apply with respect to 
religion to premises used primarily for religious purposes. The United 
States of America shall be deemed a beneficiary of this covenant without 
regard to whether it remains the owner of any land or interest therein 
in the locality of the property hereby conveyed and shall have the sole 
right to enforce this covenant in any court of competent jurisdiction.

    (c) Any deed, lease, or other instrument executed to dispose of 
property under this subpart, subject to reservations, restrictions, or

disposal agency shall incorporate such information into any deed, lease, 
or other instrument executed pursuant to part 101-47. See the language 
contained in Sec. 101-47.304-14. In the case where the purchaser is a 
potentially responsible party (PRP) with respect to the hazardous

Sec. 101-47.308-1  Power transmission lines.

    (a) Pursuant and subject to the provisions of section 13(d) of the 
Surplus Property Act of 1944 (50 U.S.C. App. 1622(d)), which is 
continued in effect by section 602(a) of the Federal Property and 
Administrative Services Act of 1949, any State or political subdivision 
thereof, or any State or Government agency or instrumentality may 
certify to the disposal agency that a surplus power transmission line 
and the right-of-way acquired for its construction is needful for or 
adaptable to the requirements of a public or cooperative power project. 
Disposal agencies shall notify such State entities and Government 
agencies of the availability of such property in accordance with 
Sec. 101-47.303-2.
    (b) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subpart, whenever a 
State or political subdivision thereof, or a State or Government agency

power project, the property may be sold for such utilization at the fair 
market value thereof.
    (c) In the event a sale cannot be accomplished by reason of the 
price to be charged or otherwise and the certification is not withdrawn, 
the disposal agency shall report the facts involved to the Administrator 
of General Services, for a determination by him as to the further action 
to be taken to dispose of the property.
    (d) Any power transmission line and right-of-way not disposed of 
pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be disposed of in 
accordance with other applicable provisions of this subpart, including,

Sec. 101-47.308-2  Property for public airports.

    (a) Pursuant and subject to the provisions of section 13(g) of the 
Surplus Property Act of 1944 (49 U.S.C. 47151), airport property may be 
conveyed or disposed of to a State, political subdivision, municipality, 
or tax-supported institution for a public airport. Airport property is 
any surplus real property including improvements and personal property 
located thereon as a part of the operating unit (exclusive of property 
the highest and best use of which is determined by the Administrator of 
General Services to be industrial and which shall be so classified for 
disposal without regard to the provisions of this section) which, in the 
determination of the Administrator of the Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA) is essential, suitable, or desirable for the 
development, improvement, operation, or maintenance of a public airport, 
as defined in the Federal Airport Act, as amended (49 U.S.C. 1101), or 
reasonably necessary to fulfill the immediate and foreseeable future 
requirements of the grantee for the development, improvement, operation, 
or maintenance of a public airport, including property needed to develop 
sources of revenue from nonaviation businesses at a public airport.
    (b) The disposal agency shall notify eligible public agencies, in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 101-47.303-2, that property which 
may be disposed of for use as a public airport under the Act of 1944, as 
amended, has been determined to be surplus. There shall betransmitted 
with the copy of each such notice when sent to the proper regional 
office of the Federal Aviation Administration, Sec. 101-47.303-2(d), a 
copy of the holding agency's Report of Excess Real Property (Standard 
Form 118, with accompanying schedules).
    (c) As promptly as possible after receipt of the copy of the notice 
given to eligible public agencies and the copy of Standard Form 118, the 
Federal Aviation Administration shall inform the disposal agency of the 
determination of the Administrator of the Federal Aviation 
Administration required by the provisions of the Act of 1944, as 
amended. The Federal Aviation Administration, thereafter, shall render 
such assistance to any eligible public agency known to have a need for 
the property for a public airport as may be necessary for such need to 
be considered in the development of a comprehensive and coordinated plan 
of use and procurement for the property. An application form and 
instructions for the preparation of an application shall be furnished to 
the eligible public agency by the disposal agency upon request.
    (d) Whenever an eligible public agency has submitted a plan of use 
and application to acquire property for a public airport, in accordance 
with the provisions of Sec. 101-47.303-2, the disposal agency shall 
transmit two copies of the plan and two copies of the application to the 
proper regional office of the Federal Aviation Administration. The 
Federal Aviation Administration shall promptly submit to the disposal 
agency a recommendation for disposal of the property for a public 
airport or shall inform the disposal agency that no such recommendation 
will be submitted.
    (e) Upon receipt of such recommendation, the disposal agency may, 
with the approval of the head of the disposal agency or his designee, 
convey property recommended by the Federal Aviation Administration for 
disposal for a public airport to the eligible public agency, subject to 
the provisions of the Surplus Property Act of 1944, as amended. Approval 
for aviation areas shall be based on established FAA guidelines, 
criteria, and requirements

[[Page 692]]

for such areas. Approval for nonaviation revenue-producing areas shall 
be given only for such areas as are anticipated to generate net proceeds 
which do not exceed expected deficits for operation of the aviation area 
applied for at the airport.
    (f) Any airport property not recommended by the Federal Aviation 
Administration for disposal pursuant to the provisions of this 
subsection for use as a public airport shall be disposed of in 
accordance with other applicable provisions of this subpart. However, 
the holding agency shall first be notified of the inability of the 
disposal agency to dispose of the property for use as a public airport 
and shall be allowed 30 days to withdraw the property from surplus or to 
waive any future interest in the property for public airport use.
    (g) The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration has the 
sole responsibility for enforcing compliance with the terms and 
conditions of disposal, and for the reformation, correction, or 
amendment of any disposal instrument and the granting of releases and 
for taking any necessary action for recapturing such property in 
accordance with the provisions of the Act of October 1, 1949, 63 Stat. 
700, and section 1402(c) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, 72 Stat. 
807 (50 U.S.C. App. 1622a-1622c).
    (h) In the event title to any such property is revested in the 
United States by reason of noncompliance with the terms and conditions 
of disposal, or other cause, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation 
Administration shall have accountability for the property and shall 
report the property to GSA as excess property in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 101-47.202.
    (i) Section 23 of the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970 
(Airport Act of 1970) is not applicable to the transfer of airports to 
State and local agencies. The transfer of airports to State and local 
agencies may be made only under section 13(g) of the Surplus Property 
Act of 1944 which is continued in effect by the Act. Only property which 
the holding agency determines cannot be reported excess to GSA for 
disposition under the Act, but which, nevertheless, may be made 
available for use by a State or local public body for public airport 
purposes without being inconsistent with the Federal program of the 
holding agency, may be conveyed under section 23 of the Airport Act of 
1970. In the latter instance, section 23 may be used for the transfer of 
nonexcess land for airport development purposes providing that such real 
property does not constitute an entire airport. An entire, existing and 
established airport can only be disposed of to a State or eligible local 
government under section 13(g) of the Surplus Property Act of 1944.

Sec. 101-47.308-3  Property for use as historic monuments.

    (a) Under section 203(k)(3) of the act, the disposal agency may, in 
its discretion, convey, without monetary consideration, to any State, 
political subdivision, instrumentalities thereof, or municipality, 
surplus real and related personal property for use as a historic 
monument for the benefit of the public provided the Secretary of the 
Interior has determined that the property is suitable and desirable for 
such use. No property shall be determined to be suitable or desirable 
for use as a historic monument except in conformity with the 
recommendation of the Advisory Board on National Parks, Historic Sites, 
Buildings, and Monuments. In addition, the disposal agency may authorize 
the use of property conveyed under subsection 203(k)(3) of the act or 
the Surplus Property Act of 1944, as amended, for revenue-producing 
activities if the Secretary of the Interior:
    (1) Determines that such activities, as described in the applicant's 
proposed program of utilization, are compatible with the use of the 
property for historic monument purposes;
    (2) Approves the grantee's plan for repair, rehabilitation, 
restoration, and maintenance of the property;
    (3) Approves the grantee's plan for financing the repair, 
rehabilitation, restoration, and maintenance of the property. The plan 
shall not be approved unless it provides that all incomes in excess of 
costs of repair, rehabilitation,

[[Page 693]]

restoration, maintenance and a specified reasonable profit or payment 
that may accrue to a lessor, sublessor, or developer in connection with 
the management, operation, or development of the property for revenue 
producing activities shall be used by the grantee, lessor, sublessor, or 
developer, only for public historic preservation, park, or recreational 
purposes; and
    (4) Examines and approves the grantee's accounting and financial 
procedures for recording and reporting on revenue-producing activities.
    (b) The disposal agency shall notify State and areawide 
clearinghouses and eligible public agencies, in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 101-47.303-2, that property which may be disposed of 
for use as a historic monument has been determined to be surplus. A copy 
of the holding agency's Standard Form 118, Report of Excess Real 
Property, with accompanying schedules shall be transmitted with the copy 
of each such notice when it is sent to the proper regional office of the 
Bureau of Outdoor Recreation as provided in Sec. 101-47.303-2(d).
    (c) Upon request, the disposal agency shall furnish eligible public 
agencies with an application form to acquire real property for permanent 
use as a historic monument and advise the potential applicant that it 
should consult with the appropriate Bureau of Outdoor Recreation 
Regional Office early in the process of developing the application.
    (d) Eligible public agencies shall submit the original and two 
copies of the completed application to acquire real property for use as 
a historic monument in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 101-
47.303-2 to the appropriate Bureau of Outdoor Recreation Regional Office 
which will forward one copy of the application to the appropriate 
regional office of the disposal agency. After consultation with the 
National Park Service, the Bureau of Outdoor Recreation shall promptly 
submit to the disposal agency the determination required of the 
Secretary of the Interior under section 203(k)(3) of the act for 
disposal of the property for a historic monument and compatible revenue-
producing activities or shall inform the disposal agency that no such 
recommendation will be submitted.
    (e) Upon receipt of the determination, the disposal agency may with 
the approval of the head of the disposal agency or his designee convey 
to an eligible public agency property determined by the Secretary of the 
Interior to be suitable and desirable for use as a historic monument for 
the benefit of the public and for compatible revenue-producing 
activities subject to the provisions of section 203(k)(3) of the Act.
    (f) The Secretary of the Interior has the responsibility for 
enforcing compliance with the terms and conditions of disposals; the 
reformation, correction, or amendment of any disposal instrument; the 
granting of releases; and any action necessary for recapturing such 
property in accordance with the provisions of section 203(k)(4) of the 
act. Any such action shall be subject to the disapproval of the head of 
the disposal agency.
    (g) The Department of the Interior shall notify the appropriate GSA 
regional Real Property Division, Public Buildings Service, immediately 
by letter when title to such historic property is to be revested in the 
United States for noncompliance with the terms and conditions of 
disposal or for other cause. The notification shall cite the legal and 
administrative actions that the Department must take to obtain full 
title and possession of the property. In addition, it shall include an 
adequate description of the property, including any improvements 
constructed thereon since the original conveyance to the grantee. Upon 
receipt of a statement from the Department that title to the property 
has revested, GSA will assume custody and accountability of the 
property. However, the grantee shall be required to provide protection 
and maintenance of the property until such time as the title reverts to 
the Federal Government, including the period of any notice of intent to 
revert. Such protection and maintenance shall, at a minimum, conform to 
to the standards prescribed in Sec. 101-47.4913.

Sec. 101-47.308-4  Property for educational and public health purposes.

    (a) The head of the disposal agency or his designee is authorized, 
at his discretion:
    (1) To assign to the Secretary of the Department of Education (ED) 
for disposal under section 203(k)(1) of the Act such surplus real 
property, including buildings, fixtures, and equipment situated thereon, 
as is recommended by the Secretary as being needed for school, 
classroom, or other educational use, or
    (2) To assign to the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) 
for disposal under section 203(k)(1) of the Act such surplus real 
property, including buildings, fixtures, and equipment situated thereon, 
as is recommended by the Secretary as being needed for use in the 
protection of public health, including research.
    (b) With respect to real property and related personal property 
which may be made available for assignment to ED or HHS for disposal 
under section 203(k)(1) of the Act for educational or public health 
purposes, the disposal agency shall notify eligible public agencies, in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 101-47.303-2, that such property 
has been determined to be surplus. Such notice to eligible public 
agencies shall state that any planning for an educational or public 
health use, involved in the development of the comprehensive and 
coordinated plan of use and procurement for the property, must be 
coordinated with ED or HHS, as appropriate, and that an application form 
for such use of the property and instructions for the preparation and 
submission of an application may be obtained from ED or HHS. The 
requirement for educational or public health use of the property by an 
eligible public agency will be contingent upon the disposal agency's 
approval under paragraph (i) of this section, of a recommendation for 
assignment of Federal surplus real property received from ED or HHS and 
any subsequent transfer shall be subject to the disapproval of the head 
of the disposal agency as stipulated under section 203(k)(1) (A) or (B) 
of the Act and referenced in paragraph (j) of this section.
    (c) With respect to surplus real property and related personal 
property which may be made available for assignment to either Secretary 
for disposal under section 203(k)(1) of the Act for educational or 
public health purposes to nonprofit institutions which have been held 
exempt from taxation under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue 
Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)), ED or HHS may notify eligible 
nonprofit institutions, in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 101-
47.303-2(e), that such property has been determined to be surplus. Any 
such notice to eligible nonprofit institutions shall state that any 
requirement for educational or public health use of the property should 
be coordinated with the public agency declaring to the disposal agency 
an intent to develop and submit a comprehensive and coordinated plan of 
use and procurement for the property. The requirement for educational or 
public health use of the property by an eligible nonprofit institution 
will be contingent upon the disposal agency's approval, under paragraph 
(i) of this section, of an assignment recommendation received from ED or 
HHS and any subsequent transfer shall be subject to the disapproval of 
the head of the disposal agency as stipulated under section 203(k)(1) 
(A) or (B) of the Act and referenced in (j) below.
    (d) ED and HHS shall notify the disposal agency within 20-calendar 
days after the date of the notice of determination of surplus if it has 
an eligible applicant interested in acquiring the property. Whenever ED 
or HHS has notified the disposal agency within the said 20-calendar day 
period of a potential educational or public health requirement for the 
property, ED or HHS shall submit to the disposal agency within 25-
calendar days after the expiration of the 20-calendar day period, a 
recommendation for assignment of the property, or shall inform the 
disposal agency, within the 25-calendar day period, that a 
recommendation will not be made for assignment of the property.
    (e) Whenever an eligible public agency has submitted a plan of use 
for property for an educational or public health requirement, in 
accordance with the

[[Page 695]]

provisions of Sec. 101-47.303-2, the disposal agency shall transmit two 
copies of the plan to the regional office of ED or HHS as appropriate. 
ED or HHS shall submit to the disposal agency, within 25-calendar days 
after the date the plan is transmitted, a recommendation for assignment 
of the property to the Secretary of ED or HHS, or shall inform the 
disposal agency, within the 25-calendar day period, that a 
recommendation will not be made for assignment of the property to ED or 
HHS as appropriate.
    (f) Any assignment recommendation submitted to the disposal agency 
by ED or HHS shall set forth complete information concerning the 
educational or public health use, including: (1) Identification of the 
property, (2) the name of the applicant and the size and nature of its 
program, (3) the specific use planned, (4) the intended public benefit 
allowance, (5) the estimate of the value upon which such proposed 
allowance is based, and, (6) if the acreage or value of the property 
exceeds the standards established by the Secretary, an explanation 
therefor. ED or HHS shall furnish to the holding agency a copy of the 
recommendation, unless the holding agency is also the disposal agency.
    (g) Holding agencies shall cooperate to the fullest extent possible 
with representatives of ED or HHS in their inspection of such property 
and in furnishing information relating thereto.
    (h) In the absence of an assignment recommendation from ED or HHS 
submitted pursuant to Sec. 101-47.308-4 (d) or (e), and received within 
the 25-calendar day time limit specified therein, the disposal agency 
shall proceed with other disposal action.
    (i) If, after considering other uses for the property, the disposal 
agency approves the assignment recommendation from ED or HHS, it shall 
assign the property by letter or other document to the Secretary of ED 
or HHS as appropriate. If the recommendation is disapproved, the 
disposal agency shall likewise notify the appropriate Department. The 
disposal agency shall furnish to the holding agency a copy of the 
assignment, unless the holding agency is also the disposal agency.
    (j) Subsequent to the receipt of the disposal agency's letter of 
assignment, ED or HHS shall furnish to the disposal agency a Notice of 
Proposed Transfer in accordance with section 203(k)(1) (A) or (B) of the 
Act. If the disposal agency has not disapproved the proposed transfer 
within 30-calendar days of the receipt of the Notice of Proposed 
Transfer, ED or HHS may proceed with the transfer.
    (k) ED or HHS shall furnish the Notice of Proposed Transfer within 
35-calendar days after the disposal agency's letter of assignment and 
shall prepare the transfer documents and take all necessary actions to 
accomplish the transfer within 15-calendar days after the expiration of 
the 30-calendar day period provided for the disposal agency to consider 
the notice. ED or HHS shall furnish the disposal agency two conformed 
copies of deeds, leases or other instruments conveying the property 
under section 203(k)(1) (A) or (B) of the Act and all related documents 
containing restrictions or conditions regulating the future use, 
maintenance or transfer of the property.
    (l) ED or HHS, as appropriate, has the responsibility for enforcing 
compliance with the terms and conditions of transfer; for the 
reformation, correction, or amendment of any transfer instrument; for 
the granting of releases; and for the taking of any necessary actions 
for recapturing such property in accordance with the provisions of 
section 203(k)(4) of the Act. Any such action shall be subject to the 
disapproval of the head of the disposal agency. Notice to the head of 
the disposal agency by ED or HHS of any action proposed to be taken 
shall identify the property affected, set forth in detail the proposed 
action, and state the reasons therefor.
    (m) In each case of repossession under a terminated lease or 
reversion of title by reason of noncompliance with the terms or 
conditions of sale or other cause, ED or HHS shall, at or prior to such 
repossession or reversion of title, provide the appropriate GSA regional 
office with an accurate description of the real and related personal 
property involved. Standard Form 118, Report of Excess Real Property, 
and the appropriate schedules

[[Page 696]]

shall be used for this purpose. Upon receipt of advice from ED or HHS 
that such property has been repossessed or title has reverted, GSA will 
assume custody of and accountability for the property. However, the 
grantee shall be required to provide protection and maintenance for the 
property until such time as the title reverts to the Federal Government, 
including the period of any notice of intent to revert. Such protection 
and maintenance shall, at a minimum, conform to the standards prescribed 
in Sec. 101-47.4913.

    (a) Surplus military chapels shall be segregated from other 
buildings, and shall be disposed of intact, separate and apart from the 
land, for use off-site as shrines, memorials, or for religious purposes, 
except in cases in which the chapel is located on surplus Government-
owned land and the disposal agency determines that it may properly be 
used in place, in which cases a suitable area of land may be set aside 
for such purposes, and sold with the chapel.
    (1) Application. Applications for the purchase of surplus chapels 
for use off-site or for use in-place shall be solicited by public 
advertising. All applications received in response to advertising shall 
be submitted to the Chief of Chaplains of the service which had 
jurisdiction over the property during the period of Government use 
thereof for military purposes and shall be disposed of in accordance 
with his recommendation. If no recommendation is received from the Chief 
of Chaplains within 30 days from the date of such submission, the 
disposal agency may select the purchaser on the basis of the needs of 
the applicants and the best interests of the community to be served. If 
no application is received for transfer of the property for shrine, 
memorial, or religious uses, the Chief of Chaplains shall be notified 
accordingly, and disposal of the property shall be held in abeyance for 
a period not to exceed 60 days thereafter to afford additional time for 
the filing of applications. If no such application is received during 
the extended period, the property may be disposed of for uses other than 
shrine, memorial, or religious purposes pursuant to other applicable 
provisions of this subpart.
    (2) Sale price. The sale price of the chapel shall be a price equal 
to its appraised fair market value in the light of conditions imposed 
relating to its future use and the estimated cost of removal, where 
required. The sale price of the land shall be a price equal to the 
appraised fair market value of the land based upon the highest and best 
use of the land at the time of the disposal.
    (3) Conditions of transfer. All chapels disposed of pursuant to the 
authority of this section shall be transferred subject to the condition 
that during the useful life thereof they be maintained and used as 
shrines, memorials, or for religious purposes and not for any 
commercial, industrial, or other secular use; and that in the event a 
transferee fails to maintain and use the chapel for such purposes there 
shall become due and payable to the Government the difference between 
the appraised fair market value of the chapel, as of the date of the 
transfer, without restrictions on its use, and the price actually paid. 
Where the land on which the chapel is located is sold with the chapel, 
no conditions or restrictions on the use of the land shall be included 
in the deed.
    (4) Release of restrictions. The disposal agency may release the 
conditions of transfer without payment of a monetary consideration upon 
a determination that the property no longer serves the purpose for which 
it was transferred or that such release will not prevent accomplishment 
of the purpose for which the property was transferred. Such 
determination shall be in writing, shall state the facts and 
circumstances involved, and shall be preserved in the files of the 
disposal agency.
    (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Sec. 101-47.308-5, a 
chapel and underlying land that is a component unit of a larger parcel 
of surplus real property recommended by the Secretary of Health, 
Education, and Welfare as being needed for educational or public health 
purposes, may be included in an assignment of such property, when so 
recommended by the Secretary, for disposal subject to the condition that 
the instrument of conveyance shall require

[[Page 697]]

that during the useful life of the chapel it shall be maintained and 
used by the grantee as a shrine, memorial, or for religious purposes.

47.308-9(d), and received within the 25 calendar-day time limit 
specified therein, the disposal agency shall proceed with other disposal

be used or maintained for such purpose during such period, all or any 
portion of such property shall in its then existing condition, at the 
option of the United States, revert to the United States and may contain 
such additional terms, reservations, restrictions, and conditions as may 
be determined by the Administrator of General Services to be necessary 
to safeguard the interest of the United States.
    (i) The Administrator of General Services has the responsibility for 
enforcing compliance with the terms and conditions of disposals; the 
reformation, correction, or amendment of any disposal instrument; the 
granting of releases; and any action necessary for recapturing such 
property in accordance with the provisions of section 203(p)(3) of the 
Act.
    (j) The OJP will notify GSA upon discovery of any information 
indicating a change in use and, upon request, make a redetermination of 
continued appropriateness of the use of a transferred property.
    (k) In each case of repossession under a reversion of title by 
reason of noncompliance with the terms of the conveyance documents, GSA 
will assume custody of and accountability for the property. However, the 
grantee shall be required to provide protection and maintenance for the 
property until such time as the title reverts to the Federal Government, 
including the period of any notice of intent to revert. Such protection 
and maintenance shall, at a minimum, conform to the standards prescribed 
in Sec. 101-47.4913.

    (4) A statement that DOT's determination that the property is 
located in an area of serious economic disruption was made in 
consultation with the Secretary of Labor; and
    (5) A statement that DOT's approval of the economic development plan 
associated with the plan of use of the property was made in consultation 
with the Secretary of Commerce.
    (g) Holding agencies shall cooperate to the fullest extent possible 
with representatives of DOT and the Secretary of Commerce in their 
inspection of such property, and of the Secretary of Labor in affirming 
that the property is in an area of serious economic disruption, and in 
furnishing any information relating thereto.
    (h) In the absence of an assignment recommendation from DOT 
submitted pursuant to paragraph (d) or (e) of this section, and received 
within the 25-calendar-day time limit specified therein,

[[Page 704]]

the disposal agency shall proceed with other disposal action.
    (i) If, after considering other uses for the property, the disposal 
agency approves the assignment recommendation from DOT, it shall assign 
the property by letter or other document to DOT. If the recommendation 
is disapproved, the disposal agency shall likewise notify DOT. The 
disposal agency shall furnish to the holding agency a copy of the 
assignment, unless the holding agency is also the disposal agency.
    (j) Subsequent to the receipt of the letter of assignment from the 
disposal agency, DOT shall furnish to the disposal agency, a Notice of 
Proposed Conveyance in accordance with section 203(q)(2) of the Act. If 
the disposal agency has not disapproved the proposed transfer within 35 
calendar-days of the receipt of the Notice of Proposed Conveyance, DOT 
may proceed with the conveyance.
    (k) DOT shall furnish the Notice of Proposed Conveyance within 35 
calendar-days after the date of the letter of assignment from the 
disposal agency, prepare the conveyance documents, and take all 
necessary actions to accomplish the conveyance within 15 calendar-days 
after the expiration of the 30-calendar-day period provided for the 
disposal agency to consider the notice. DOT shall furnish the disposal 
agency two conformed copies of the instruments conveying property under 
subsection 203(q) of the Act and all related documents containing 
restrictions or conditions regulating the future use, maintenance, or 
transfer of the property.
    (l) DOT has the responsibility for enforcing compliance with the 
terms and conditions of conveyance; for reformation, correction, or 
amendment of any instrument of conveyance; for the granting of release; 
and for the taking of any necessary actions for recapturing such 
property in accordance with the provisions of subsection 203(q)(4) of 
the Act. Any such action shall be subject to the disapproval of the head 
of the disposal agency. Notice to the head of the disposal agency, by 
DOT, of any action proposed to be taken shall identify the property 
affected, set forth in detail the proposed action, and state the reasons 
therefor.
    (m) In each case of repossession under a reversion of title by 
reason of noncompliance with the terms or conditions of conveyance or 
other cause, DOT shall, at or prior to such reversion of title, provide 
the appropriate GSA regional office, with an accurate description of the 
real and related personal property involved. Standard Form 118, Report 
of Excess Real Property, and appropriate accompanying schedules shall be 
used for this purpose. Upon receipt of advice from DOT that such 
property has been repossessed, GSA will review and act upon the Standard 
Form 118. However, the grantee shall be required to provide protection 
and maintenance for the property until such time as the title reverts to 
the Federal Government, including the period of any notice of intent to 
revert. Such protection and maintenance shall, at a minimum, conform to 
the standards prescribed in Sec. 101-47.4913.

<R05>
Sec. 101-47.309  Disposal of leases, permits, licenses, and similar instruments.

    The disposal agency may, subject to such reservations, restrictions, 
and conditions, if any, as the disposal agency deems necessary properly 
to protect the interests of the United States against liability under a 
lease, permit, license, or similar instrument:
    (a) Dispose of the lease or other instrument subject to assumption 
by the transferee of the obligations in the lease or other instrument 
unless a transfer is prohibited by the terms of the lease or other 
instrument; or
    (b) Terminate the lease or other instrument by notice or negotiated 
agreement; and
    (c) Dispose of any surplus Government-owned improvements located on 
the premises in the following order by any one or more of the following 
methods:
    (1) By disposition of all or a portion thereof to the transferee of 
the lease or other instrument (not applicable when the lease or other 
instrument is terminated);

[[Page 705]]

    (2) By disposition to the owner of the premises or grantor of a 
sublease, as the case may be, (i) in full satisfaction of a contractual 
obligation of the Government to restore the premises, or (ii) in 
satisfaction of a contractual obligation of the Government to restore 
the premises plus the payment of a money consideration to the Government 
by the owner or grantor, as the case may be, that is fair and reasonable 
under the circumstances, or (iii) in satisfaction of a contractual 
obligation of the Government to restore the premises plus the payment by 
the Government to the owner or grantor, as the case may be, of a money 
consideration that is fair and reasonable under the circumstances; or
    (3) By disposition for removal from the premises.

Provided, That any negotiated disposals shall be subject to the 
applicable provisions of Secs. 101-47.304-9 and 101-47.30-12. The 
cancellation of the Government's restoration obligations in return for 
the conveyance of the Government-owned improvements to the lessor is 
considered a settlement of a contractual obligation rather than a 
disposal of surplus real property and, therefore, is not subject to the 
provisions of Secs. 101-47.304-9 and 101-47.304-12.

the land: Provided, That prefabricated movable structures such as 
Butler-type storage warehouses, and quonset huts, and housetrailers 
(with or without under carriages) reported to GSA with the land on which 
they are located, may, in the discretion of GSA, be designated for 
disposal as personal property for off-site use.


<R05>
Sec. 101-47.311  Disposal of residual personal property.

    (a) Any related personal property reported to GSA on Standard Form 
118 which is not disposed of by GSA as related to the real property, 
shall be designated by GSA for disposal as personal property.
    (b) Any related personal property which is not disposed of by the 
holding agency, pursuant to the authority contained in Sec. 101-47.302, 
or authority otherwise delegated by the Administrator of General 
Services as related to the real property, shall be disposed of under the 
applicable provisions of part 101-45.


<R05>
Sec. 101-47.312  Non-Federal interim use of property.

    (a) A lease or permit may be granted by the holding agency with the 
approval of the disposal agency, for non-Federal interim use of surplus 
property; Provided, That such lease or permit shall be for a period not 
exceeding 1 year and shall be made revocable on not to exceed 30 days' 
notice by the disposal agency: And provided further, That the use and 
occupancy will not interfere with, delay, or retard the disposal of the 
property. In such cases, an immediate right of entry to such property 
may be granted pending execution of the formal lease or permit. The 
lease or permit shall be for a money consideration and shall be on such 
other terms and conditions as are deemed appropriate to properly protect 
the interest of the United States. Any negotiated lease or permit under 
this section shall be subject to the applicable provisions of Secs. 101-
47.304-9 and 101-47.304-12, except that no explanatory statement to the 
appropriate committees of the Congress need to be prepared with respect 
to a negotiated lease or permit providing for an annual net rental of 
$100,000 or less, and termination by either part on 30 days' notice.

<R05>
Sec. 101-47.313-1  Disposal of easements to owner of servient estate.

    The disposal agency may dispose of an easement to the owner of the 
land which is subject to the easement when the continued use, occupancy, 
or control of the easement is not needed for the operation, production, 
use, or

[[Page 706]]

maintenance of property owned or controlled by the Government. A 
determination shall be made by the disposal agency as to whether the 
disposal shall be with or without consideration to the Government on the 
basis of all the circumstances and factors involved and with due regard 
to the acquisition cost of the easement to the Government. The extent of 
such consideration shall be regarded as the appraised fair market value 
of the easement. The disposal agency shall document the circumstances 
and factors leading to such determination and retain such documentation 
in its files.


<R05>
Sec. 101-47.313-2  Grants of easements in or over Government property.

    The disposal agency may grant easements in or over real property on 
appropriate terms and conditions: Provided, That where the disposal 
agency determines that the granting of such easement decreases the value 
of the property, the granting of the easement shall be for a 
consideration not less than the amount by which the fair market value of 
the property is decreased.

Sec. 101-47.314  Compliance.


<R05>
Sec. 101-47.314-1  General.

    Subject to the provisions of Sec. 101-47.314-2(a), requiring 
referral of criminal matters to the Department of Justice, each disposal 
agency shall perform such investigatory functions as are necessary to 
insure compliance with the provisions of the Act and with the 
regulations, orders, directives, and policy statements of the 
Administrator of General Services.


<R05>
Sec. 101-47.314-2  Extent of investigations.

    (a) Referral to other Government agencies. All information 
indicating violations by any person of Federal criminal statutes, or 
violations of section 209 of the Act, including but not limited to fraud 
against the Government, mail fraud, bribery, attempted bribery, or 
criminal collusion, shall be referred immediately to the Department of 
Justice for further investigation and disposition. Each disposal agency 
shall make available to the Department of Justice, or to such other 
governmental investigating agency to which the matter may be referred by 
the Department of Justice, all pertinent information and evidence 
concerning the indicated violations; shall desist from further 
investigation of the criminal aspects of such matters except upon the 
request of the Department of Justice; and shall cooperate fully with the 
agency assuming final jurisdiction in establishing proof of criminal 
violations. After making the necessary referral to the Department of 
Justice, inquiries conducted by disposal agency compliance organizations 
shall be limited to obtaining information for administrative purposes. 
Where irregularities reported or discovered involve wrongdoing on the 
part of individuals holding positions in Government agencies other than 
the agency initiating the investigation, the case shall be reported 
immediately to the Administrator of General Services for an examination 
in the premises.
    (b) Compliance reports. A written report shall be made of all 
compliance investigations conducted by each agency compliance 
organization. Each disposal agency shall maintain centralized files of 
all such reports at its respective departmental offices. Until otherwise 
directed by the Administrator of General Services, there shall be 
transmitted promptly to the Administrator of General Services one copy 
of any such report which contains information indicating criminality on 
the part of any person or indicating noncompliance with the Act or with 
the regulations, orders, directives and policy statements of the 
Administrator of General Services. In transmitting such reports to the 
Administrator of General Services, the agency shall set forth the action 
taken or contemplated by the agency to correct the improper conditions 
established by the investigation. Where any matter is referred to the 
Department of Justice, a copy of the letter of referral shall be 
transmitted to the Administrator of General Services.

    The holding agency shall be responsible for all expense to the 
Government and for the supervision of decontamination of excess and 
surplus real property that has been subjected to contamination with 
hazardous materials of any sort. Extreme care must be exercised in the 
decontamination, and in the management and disposal of contaminated 
property in order to prevent such properties becoming a hazard to the 
general public. The disposal agency shall be made cognizant of any and

succeeding quarter of the fiscal year after the date that the property 
is available for immediate disposition. If the holding agency requests 
deferral of the disposal, continues to occupy the property beyond the

paid or reimbursed by the disposal agency will be specified in a written 
agreement between the holding agency and the disposal agency, but such 
payment or reimbursement is subject to the appropriations by Congress to 
the disposal agency of funds sufficient to make such payment or 
reimbursement. In accordance with the written agreement, the disposal 
agency and the holding agency will sign an obligational document only if 
and when Congress actually appropriates to the disposal agency, pursuant 
to its request, funds sufficient to pay or reimburse the holding agency 
for protection and maintenance expenses, as agreed. In the absence of a 
written agreement, the holding agency shall be responsible for all

finding shall not be made by any official directly accountable for the 
property covered thereby.
    (b) Whenever all the property proposed to be disposed of hereunder 
by a Federal agency at any one location at any one time had an original 
cost (estimated if not known) of more than $1,000, findings made under 
Sec. 101-47.501-4(a), shall be approved by a reviewing authority before

<R05>
Sec. 101-47.503-1  General.

    (a) No improvements on land or related personal property shall be 
abandoned or destroyed by a Federal agency unless a duly authorized

feasible. This finding shall be in addition to the finding prescribed in 
Sec. 101-47.501-4. If at any time prior to actual

[[Page 710]]

abandonment or destruction the donation of the property pursuant to this 
subpart becomes feasible, such donation will be accomplished.
    (b) No abandonment or destruction shall be made in a manner which is 
detrimental or dangerous to public health or safety or which will cause 
infringement of the rights of other persons.
    (c) The concurrence of GSA shall be obtained prior to the 
abandonment or destruction of improvements on land or related personal 
property (1) which had an original cost (estimated if not known) of more 
than $50,000, or (2) which are of permanent type construction, or (3) 
where their retention would enhance the value of the underlying land, if

office of GSA for the region in which the property is located.


<R05>
Sec. 101-47.503-3  Abandonment or destruction without notice.

    If (a) the property had an original cost (estimated if not known) of 
not more than $1,000; or (b) its value is so low or the cost of its care 
and handling so great that its retention in order to post public notice 
is clearly not economical; or (c) immediate abandonment or destruction 
is required by considerations of health, safety, or security; or (d) the 
assigned mission of the agency might be jeopardized by the delay, and a 
finding with respect to paragraph (a), (b), (c), or (d) of this section, 
is made in writing by a duly authorized official of the Federal agency 
and approved by a reviewing authority, abandonment or destruction may be 
made without public notice. Such a finding shall be in addition to the

transfer and to retransfer to each other, upon request, any of the 
property of either agency which is being used and will continue to be 
used in the administration of any functions relating to the Indians. The 
term property, as used in this Sec. 101-47.604, includes real property 
and such personal property as the Secretary making the transfer or

   Subpart 101-47.8--Identification of Unneeded Federal Real Property


<R05>
Sec. 101-47.800  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart is designed to implement, in part, section 2 of 
Executive Order 12512, which provides, in part, that the Administrator 
of General Services shall provide Governmentwide policy, oversight and 
guidance for Federal real property management. The Administrator of 
General Services shall issue standards, procedures, and guidelines for 
the conduct of surveys of real property holdings of Executive agencies 
on a continuing basis to identify properties which are not utilized, are 
underutilized, or are not being put to their optimum use; and make 
reports describing any property or portion thereof which has not been 
reported excess to the requirements of the holding agency and which, in 
the judgment of the Administrator, is not utilized, is underutilized, or 
is not being put to optimum use, and which he recommends should be 
reported as excess property. The provisions of this subpart are 
presently limited to fee-owned properties and supporting leaseholds and 
lesser interests located within the States of the United States, the 
District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, 
Guam, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, and the Virgin 
Islands. The scope of this subpart may be enlarged at a later date to 
include real property in additional geographical areas and other 
interests in real property.
[51 FR 193, Jan. 3, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 101-47.801  Standards.

    Each executive agency shall use the following standards in 
identifying unneeded Federal property.
    (a) Definitions--(1) Not utilized. ``Not utilized'' means an entire 
property or portion thereof, with or without improvements, not occupied 
for current program purposes of the accountable executive agency, or 
occupied in caretaker status only.
    (2) Underutilized. ``Underutilized'' means an entire property or 
portion thereof, with or without improvements:
    (i) Which is used only at irregular periods or intermittently by the 
accountable executive agency for current program purposes of that 
agency; or
    (ii) Which is used for current program purposes that can be 
satisfied with only a portion of the property.
    (3) Not being put to optimum use. ``Not being put to optimum use'' 
means an entire property or portion thereof, with or without 
improvements, which:
    (i) Even though utilized for current program purposes of the 
accountable executive agency is of such nature or value, or is in such a 
location that it could be utilized for a different significantly higher 
and better purpose; or
    (ii) The costs of occupying are substantially higher than would be 
applicable for other suitable properties that could be made available to 
the accountable executive agency through transfer, purchase, or lease 
with total net savings to the Government after consideration of property 
values as

[[Page 714]]

well as costs of moving, occupancy, efficiency of operations, 
environmental effects, regional planning, and employee morale.
    (b) Guidelines. The following general guidelines shall be considered 
by each executive agency in its annual review (see Sec. 101-47.802):
    (1) Is the property being put to its highest and best use?
    (i) Consider such aspects as surrounding neighborhood, zoning, and 
other environmental factors;
    (ii) Is present use compatible with State, regional, or local 
development plans and programs?
    (iii) Consider whether Federal use of the property would be 
justified if rental charge equivalent to commercial rates were added to 
the program costs for the function it is serving.
    (2) Are operating and maintenance costs excessive compared with 
those of other similar facilities?
    (3) Will contemplated program changes alter property requirements?
    (4) Is all of the property essential for program requirements?
    (5) Will local zoning provide sufficient protection for necessary 
buffer zones if a portion of the property is released?
    (6) Are buffer zones kept to a minimum?
    (7) Is the present property inadequate for approved future programs?
    (8) Can net savings to the Nation be realized through relocation 
considering property prices or rentals, costs of moving, occupancy, and 
increase in efficiency of operations?
    (9) Have developments on adjoining nonfederally owned land or public 
access or road rights-of-way granted across the Government-owned land 
rendered the property or any portion thereof unsuitable or unnecessary 
for program requirements?
    (10) If Federal employees are housed in Government-owned residential 
property, is the local market willing to acquire Government-owned 
housing or can it provide the necessary housing and other related 
services that will permit the Government-owned housing area to be 
released? (Provide statistical data on cost and availability of housing 
on the local market.)
    (11) Can the land be disposed of and program requirements satisfied 
through reserving rights and interests to the Government in the property 
if it is released?
    (12) Is a portion of any property being retained primarily because 
the present boundaries are marked by the existence of fences, hedges, 
roads, and utility systems?
    (13) Is any land being retained merely because it is considered 
undesirable property due to topographical features or to encumbrances 
for rights-of-way or because it is believed to be not disposable?
    (14) Is land being retained merely because it is landlocked?
    (15) Is there land or space in Government-owned buildings that can 
be made available for utilization by others within or outside Government 
on a temporary basis?

<R05>
Sec. 101-47.802  Procedures.

    (a) Executive agency annual review. Each executive agency shall make 
an annual review of its property holdings.
    (1) In making such annual reviews, each executive agency shall use 
the standards set forth in Sec. 101-47.801 in identifying property that 
is not utilized, is underutilized, or is not being put to its optimum 
use.
    (2) A written record of the review of each individual facility shall 
be prepared. The written review record shall contain comments relative 
to each of the above guidelines and an overall map of the facility 
showing property boundaries, major land uses, improvements, safety 
zones, proposed uses, and regulations or other authorizations that 
sanction the requirement for and usage made of or proposed for 
individual parcels of the property. A copy of the review record shall be 
made available to GSA upon request or to the GSA survey representative 
at the time of the survey of each individual facility.
    (3) Each executive agency shall, as a result of its annual review, 
determine, in its opinion, whether any portion of its property is not 
utilized, is underutilized, or is not being put to optimum

[[Page 715]]

use. With regard to each property, the following actions shall be taken:
    (i) When the property or a portion thereof is determined to be not 
utilized, the executive agency shall:
    (A) Initiate action to release the property; or
    (B) Hold for a foreseeable future program use upon determination by 
the head of the executive agency. Such determination shall be fully and 
completely documented and the determination and documentation kept 
available for GSA review (see Sec. 101-47.802(b)(3)(ii)(B)). If property 
of this type which is being held for future use can be made available 
for temporary use by others, the executive agency shall notify the 
appropriate regional office of GSA before any permit or license for use 
is issued to another Federal agency or before any out-lease is granted 
by the executive agency. GSA will advise the executive agency whether 
the property should be permitted to another Federal agency for temporary 
use and will advise the executive agency the name of the Federal agency 
to whom the permit shall be granted.
    (ii) When the property is determined to be underutilized, the 
executive agency shall:
    (A) Limit the existing program to a reduced area and initiate action 
to release the remainder; or
    (B) Shift present use imposed on the property to another property so 
that release action may be initiated for the property under review.
    (iii) When, based on an indepth study and evaluation, it is 
determined that the property is not being put to its optimum use, the 
executive agency shall relocate the current program whenever a suitable 
alternate site, necessary funding, and legislative authority are 
available to accomplish that purpose. When the site, funding, or 
legislative authority are not available, a special report shall be made 
to the appropriate regional office of GSA for its consideration in 
obtaining possible assistance in accomplishing relocation.
    (b) GSA Survey. Pursuant to section 2 of Executive Order 12512, GSA 
will conduct, on a continuing basis, surveys of real property holdings 
of all Executive agencies to identify properties which, in the judgment 
of the Administrator of General Services, are not utilized, are 
underutilized, or are not being put to their optimum use.
    (1) GSA surveys of the real property holdings of executive agencies 
will be conducted by officials of the GSA Central Office and/or regional 
offices of GSA for the property within the geographical area of each 
region.
    (i) The head of the field office of the agency having accountability 
for the facility will be notified in advance of a scheduled GSA survey 
and furnished at that time with copies of these regulations.
    (ii) The head of that field office shall arrange for an appropriate 
official of the executive agency having necessary authority, and who is 
sufficiently knowledgeable concerning the property and current and 
future program uses of the property, to be available to assist the GSA 
representative in his survey.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (3) To facilitate the GSA survey, executive agencies shall:
    (i) Cooperate fully with GSA in its conduct of the surveys; and
    (ii) Make available to the GSA survey representative records and 
information pertinent to the description and to the current and proposed 
use of the property such as:
    (A) Brief description of facilities (number of acres, buildings, and 
supporting facilities);
    (B) The most recent utilization report or analysis made of the 
property including the written record of the annual review made by the 
agency, pursuant to Sec. 101-47.802(a), together with any supporting 
documents;
    (C) Detail maps which show property boundaries, major land uses, 
improvements, safety zones, proposed uses, and regulations or other 
authorizations that sanction the usage made or proposed for individual 
parcels or the entire property; drawings; and layout plans.
    (4) Upon receipt of notification of the pending GSA survey, the 
executive agency shall initiate action immediately to provide the GSA 
representative with an escort into classified or sensitive areas or to 
inform that representative of steps that must be taken

[[Page 716]]

to obtain necessary special security clearances or both.
    (5) Upon completion of the field work for the survey:
    (i) The GSA representative will so inform the executive agency 
designated pursuant to 101-47.802(b)(1). To avoid any possibility of 
misunderstanding or premature publicity, conclusions and recommendations 
will not be discussed with this official. However, survey teams should 
discuss the facts they have obtained with local officials at the end of 
the survey to ensure that all information necessary to conduct a 
complete survey is obtained. The GSA representative will evaluate and 
incorporate the results of the field work into a survey report and 
forward the survey report to the GSA Central Office.
    (ii) The GSA Central Office will notify the head of the Executive 
agency or his designee, in writing, of the survey findings and/or 
recommendations. A copy of the survey report will be enclosed when a 
recommendation is made that some or all of the real property should be 
reported excess, and the comments of the Executive agency will be 
requested thereon. The Executive agency will be afforded 45 calendar 
days from the date of the notice in which to submit such comments. If 
the case is resolved, GSA Central Office will notify the head of the 
Executive agency or his designee, in writing, of the resolution, and the 
case will be completed at such time as the agency completes all resolved 
excess and/or disposal actions. The agency will be afforded a period of 
90 calendar days from the date of the notice to complete such actions.
    (iii)-(iv) [Reserved]
    (v) If the case is not resolved, the GSA Central Office will request 
assistance of the Executive Office of the President to obtain 
resolution.

status and classification of each property controlled by the agency 
that:
    (1) Was included in a list of suitable properties published that 
year by HUD, and
    (2) Remains available for application for use to assist the 
homeless, or has become available for application during that year.
    (c) GSA inventory. HUD will collect information, in the same manner 
as described in paragraph (a) of this section, from GSA regarding 
property that is in GSA's current inventory of excess or surplus 
property.
    (d) Change in status. If the information provided on the property 
checklist changes subsequent to HUD's determination of suitability, and 
the property remains unutilized, underutilized, excess or surplus, the 
landholding agency shall submit a revised property checklist in response 
to the next quarterly canvass. HUD will make a new determination of 
suitability and, if it differs from the previous determination, 
republish the property information in the Federal Register. For example, 
property determined unsuitable for national security concerns may no 
longer be subject to security restrictions, or property determined 
suitable may subsequently be found to be contaminated.

    Effective Date Note: Section 101-47.903 will not become effective 
until approved by the District Court for the District of Columbia 
pending further proceedings in the case National Law Center on 
Homelessness and Poverty v. Dept. of Veterans Affairs, No. 88-2503-OG 
(Dec. 12, 1988). (See 56 FR 23789, 23794 and, 23795, May 24, 1991. The 
General Services Administration will publish a document in the Federal 
Register at a later date, announcing the effective date.


<R05>
Sec. 101-47.904  Suitability determination.

    (a) Suitability determination. Within 30 days after the receipt of 
information from landholding agencies regarding properties which were 
reported pursuant to the canvass described in Sec. 101-47.903(a), HUD 
will determine, under criteria set forth in Sec. 101-47.906, which 
properties are suitable for use as facilities to assist the homeless and 
report

[[Page 719]]

its determination to the landholding agency. Properties that are under 
lease, contract, license, or agreement by which a Federal agency retains 
a real property interest or which are scheduled to become unutilized or 
underutilized will be reviewed for suitability no earlier than six 
months prior to the expected date when the property will become 
unutilized or underutilized, except that properties subject to the Base 
Closure and Realignment Act may be reviewed up to eighteen months prior 
to the expected date when the property will become unutilized or 
underutilized.
    (b) Scope of suitability. HUD will determine the suitability of a 
property for use as a facility to assist the homeless without regard to 
any particular use.
    (c) Environmental information. HUD will evaluate the environmental 
information contained in property checklists forwarded to HUD by the 
landholding agencies solely for the purpose of determining suitability 
of properties under the criteria in Sec. 101-47.906.
    (d) Written record of suitability determination. HUD will assign an 
identification number to each property reviewed for suitability. HUD 
will maintain a written public record of the following:
    (1) The suitability determination for a particular piece of 
property, and the reasons for that determination; and
    (2) The landholding agency's response to the determination pursuant 
to the requirements of Sec. 101-47.907(a).
    (e) Property determined unsuitable. Property that is reviewed by HUD 
under this section and that is determined unsuitable for use to assist 
the homeless may not be made available for any other purpose for 20 days 
after publication in the Federal Register of a Notice of unsuitability 
to allow for review of the determination at the request of a 
representative of the homeless.
    (f) Procedures for appealing unsuitability determinations. (1) To 
request review of a determination of unsuitability, a representative of 
the homeless must contact HUD within 20 days of publication of notice in 
the Federal Register that a property is unsuitable. Requests may be 
submitted to HUD in writing or by calling 1-800-927-7588 (Toll Free). 
Written requests must be received no later than 20 days after notice of 
unsuitability is published in the Federal Register.
    (2) Requests for review of a determination of unsuitability may be 
made only by representatives of the homeless, as defined in Sec. 101-
47.901.
    (3) The request for review must specify the grounds on which it is 
based, i.e., that HUD has improperly applied the criteria or that HUD 
has relied on incorrect or incomplete information in making the 
determination (e.g., that property is in a floodplain but not in a 
floodway).
    (4) Upon receipt of a request to review a determination of 
unsuitability, HUD will notify the landholding agency that such a 
request has been made, request that the agency respond with any 
information pertinent to the review, and advise the agency that it 
should refrain from initiating disposal procedures until HUD has 
completed its reconsideration regarding unsuitability.
    (i) HUD will act on all requests for review within 30 days of 
receipt of the landholding agency's response and will notify the 
representative of the homeless and the landholding agency in writing of 
its decision.
    (ii) If a property is determined suitable as a result of the review, 
HUD will request the landholding agency's determination of availability 
pursuant to Sec. 101-47.907(a), upon receipt of which HUD will promptly 
publish the determination in the Federal Register. If the determination 
of unsuitability stands, HUD will inform the representative of the 
homeless of its decision.


<R05>
Sec. 101-47.905  Real property reported excess to GSA.

    (a) Each landholding agency must submit a report to GSA of 
properties it determines excess. Each landholding agency must also 
provide a copy of HUD's suitability determination, if any, including 
HUD's identification number for the property.
    (b) If a landholding agency reports a property to GSA which has been 
reviewed by HUD for homeless assistance suitability and HUD determined 
the property suitable, GSA will screen the property pursuant to 
Sec. 101-47.905(g) and

[[Page 720]]

will advise HUD of the availability of the property for use by the 
homeless as provided in Sec. 101-47.905(e). In lieu of the above, GSA 
may submit a new checklist to HUD and follow the procedures in Sec. 101-
47.905(c) through Sec. 101-47.905(g).
    (c) If a landholding agency reports a property to GSA which has not 
been reviewed by HUD for homeless assistance suitability, GSA will 
complete a property checklist, based on information provided by the 
landholding agency, and will forward this checklist to HUD for a 
suitability determination. This checklist will reflect any change in 
classification, i.e., from unutilized or underutilized to excess.
    (d) Within 30 days after GSA's submission, HUD will advise GSA of 
the suitability determination.
    (e) When GSA receives a letter from HUD listing suitable excess 
properties in GSA's inventory, GSA will transmit to HUD within 45 days a 
response which includes the following for each identified property:
    (1) A statement that there is no other compelling Federal need for 
the property, and therefore, the property will be determined surplus; or
    (2) A statement that there is further and compelling Federal need 
for the property (including a full explanation of such need) and that, 
therefore, the property is not presently available for use to assist the 
homeless.
    (f) When an excess property is determined suitable and available and 
notice is published in the Federal Register, GSA will concurrently 
notify HHS, HUD, State and local government units, known homeless 
assistance providers that have expressed interest in the particular 
property, and other organizations, as appropriate, concerning suitable 
properties.
    (g) Upon submission of a Report of Excess to GSA, GSA may screen the 
property for Federal use. In addition, GSA may screen State and local 
governmental units and eligible nonprofit organizations to determine 
interest in the property in accordance with current regulations. (See 41 
CFR 101-47.203-5, 101-47.204-1 and 101-47.303-2.)
    (h) The landholding agency will retain custody and accountability 
and will protect and maintain any property which is reported excess to 
GSA as provided in 41 CFR 101-47.402.


<R05>
Sec. 101-47.906  Suitability criteria.

    (a) All properties, buildings and land will be determined suitable 
unless a property's characteristics include one or more of the following 
conditions:
    (1) National security concerns. A property located in an area to 
which the general public is denied access in the interest of national 
security (e.g., where a special pass or security clearance is a 
condition of entry to the property) will be determined unsuitable. Where 
alternative access can be provided for the public without compromising 
national security, the property will not be determined unsuitable on 
this basis.
    (2) Property containing flammable or explosive materials. A property 
located within 2000 feet of an industrial, commercial or Federal 
facility handling flammable or explosive material (excluding underground 
storage) will be determined unsuitable. Above ground containers with a 
capacity of 100 gallons or less, or larger containers which provide the 
heating or power source for the property, and which meet local safety, 
operation, and permitting standards, will not affect whether a 
particular property is determined suitable or unsuitable. Underground 
storage, gasoline stations and tank trucks are not included in this 
category and their presence will not be the basis of an unsuitability 
determination unless there is evidence of a threat to personal safety as 
provided in paragraph (a)(5) of this section.
    (3) Runway clear zone and military airfield clear zone. A property 
located within an airport runway clear zone or military airfield clear 
zone will be determined unsuitable.
    (4) Floodway. A property located in the floodway of a 100 year 
floodplain will be determined unsuitable. If the floodway has been 
contained or corrected, or if only an incidental portion of the property 
not affecting the use of the remainder of the property is in the 
floodway, the property will not be determined unsuitable.
    (5) Documented deficiencies. A property with a documented and 
extensive condition(s) that represents a clear

[[Page 721]]

threat to personal physical safety will be determined unsuitable. Such 
conditions may include, but are not limited to, contamination, 
structural damage or extensive deterioration, friable asbestos, PCB's, 
or natural hazardous substances such as radon, periodic flooding, 
sinkholes or earth slides.
    (6) Inaccessible. A property that is inaccessible will be determined 
unsuitable. An inaccessible property is one that is not accessible by 
road (including property on small off-shore islands) or is land locked 
(e.g., can be reached only by crossing private property and there is no 
established right or means of entry).


<R05>
Sec. 101-47.907  Determination of availability.

    (a) Within 45 days after receipt of a letter from HUD pursuant to 
Sec. 101-47.904(a), each landholding agency must transmit to HUD a 
statement of one of the following:
    (1) In the case of unutilized or underutilized property:
    (i) An intention to declare the property excess,
    (ii) An intention to make the property available for use to assist 
the homeless, or
    (iii) The reasons why the property cannot be declared excess or made 
available for use to assist the homeless. The reasons given must be 
different than those listed as suitability criteria in Sec. 101-47.906.
    (2) In the case of excess property which had previously been 
reported to GSA:
    (i) A statement that there is no compelling Federal need for the 
property, and that, therefore, the property will be determined surplus; 
or
    (ii) A statement that there is a further and compelling Federal need 
for the property (including a full explanation of such need) and that, 
therefore, the property is not presently available for use to assist the 
homeless.


<R05>
Sec. 101-47.908  Public notice of determination.

    (a) No later than 15 days after the last 45 day period has elapsed 
for receiving responses from the landholding agencies regarding 
availability, HUD will publish in the Federal Register a list of all 
properties reviewed, including a description of the property, its 
address, and classification. The following designations will be made:
    (1) Properties that are suitable and available.
    (2) Properties that are suitable and unavailable.
    (3) Properties that are suitable and to be declared excess.
    (4) Properties that are unsuitable.
    (b) Information about specific properties can be obtained by 
contacting HUD at the following toll free number, 1-800-927-7588.
    (c) HUD will transmit to the ICH a copy of the list of all 
properties published in the Federal Register. The ICH will immediately 
distribute to all state and regional homeless coordinators area-relevant 
portions of the list. The ICH will encourage the state and regional 
homeless coordinators to disseminate this information widely.
    (d) No later than February 15 of each year, HUD shall publish in the 
Federal Register a list of all properties reported pursuant to Sec. 101-
47.903(b).
    (e) HUD shall publish an annual list of properties determined 
suitable but which agencies reported unavailable including the reasons 
such properties are not available.
    (f) Copies of the lists published in the Federal Register will be 
available for review by the public in the HUD headquarters building 
library (room 8141); area-relevant portions of the lists will be 
available in the HUD regional offices and in major field offices.


<R05>
Sec. 101-47.909  Application process.

(OMB approval number 09370191)

    (a) Holding period. (1) Properties published as available for 
application for use to assist the homeless shall not be available for 
any other purpose for a period of 60 days beginning on the date of 
publication. Any representative of the homeless interested in any 
underutilized, unutilized, excess or surplus Federal property for use as 
a facility to assist the homeless must send to HHS a written expression 
of interest in that property within 60 days after the property has been 
published in the Federal Register.

[[Page 722]]

    (2) If a written expression of interest to apply for suitable 
property for use to assist the homeless is received by HHS within the 60 
day holding period, such property may not be made available for any 
other purpose until the date HHS or the appropriate landholding agency 
has completed action on the application submitted pursuant to that 
expression of interest.
    (3) The expression of interest should identify the specific 
property, briefly describe the proposed use, include the name of the 
organization, and indicate whether it is a public body or a private non-
profit organization. The expression of interest must be sent to the 
Division of Health Facilities Planning (DHFP) of the Department of 
Health and Human Services at the following address:

Director, Division of Health Facilities Planning, Public Health Service, 
room 17A-10, Parklawn Building, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Maryland 
20857.


HHS will notify the landholding agency (for unutilized and underutilized 
properties) or GSA (for excess and surplus properties) when an 
expression of interest has been received for a particular property.
    (4) An expression of interest may be sent to HHS any time after the 
60 day holding period has expired. In such a case, an application 
submitted pursuant to this expression of interest may be approved for 
use by the homeless if:
    (i) No application or written expression of interest has been made 
under any law for use of the property for any purpose; and
    (ii) In the case of excess or surplus property, GSA has not received 
a bona fide offer to purchase that property or advertised for the sale 
of the property by public auction.
    (b) Application requirements. Upon receipt of an expression of 
interest, DHFP will send an application packet to the interested entity. 
The application packet requires the applicant to provide certain 
information, including the following--
    (1) Description of the applicant organization. The applicant must 
document that it satisfies the definition of a ``representative of the 
homeless,'' as specified in Sec. 101-47.901 of this subpart. The 
applicant must document its authority to hold real property. Private 
non-profit organizations applying for deeds must document that they are 
section 501(c)(3) tax-exempt.
    (2) Description of the property desired. The applicant must describe 
the property desired and indicate that any modifications made to the 
property will conform to local use restrictions except for local zoning 
regulations.
    (3) Description of the proposed program. The applicant must fully 
describe the proposed program and demonstrate how the program will 
address the needs of the homeless population to be assisted. The 
applicant must fully describe what modifications will be made to the 
property before the program becomes operational.
    (4) Ability to finance and operate the proposed program. The 
applicant must specifically describe all anticipated costs and sources 
of funding for the proposed program. The applicant must indicate that it 
can assume care, custody, and maintenance of the property and that it 
has the necessary funds or the ability to obtain such funds to carry out 
the approved program of use for the property.
    (5) Compliance with non-discrimination requirements. Each applicant 
and lessee under this part must certify in writing that it will comply 
with the requirements of the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601-3619) and 
implementing regulations; and as applicable, Executive Order 11063 
(Equal Opportunity in Housing) and implementing regulations; title VI of 
the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d to d-4) (Nondiscrimination 
in Federally Assisted Programs) and implementing regulations; the 
prohibitions against discrimination on the basis of age under the Age 
Discrimination Act of 1975 (42 U.S.C. 6101-6107) and implementing 
regulations; and the prohibitions against otherwise qualified 
individuals with handicaps under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act 
of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and implementing regulations. The applicant must 
state that it will not discriminate on the basis of race, color, 
national origin, religion, sex, age, familial status, or handicap in the 
use of

[[Page 723]]

the property, and will maintain the required records to demonstrate 
compliance with Federal laws.
    (6) Insurance. The applicant must certify that it will insure the 
property against loss, damage, or destruction in accordance with the 
requirements of 45 CFR 12.9.
    (7) Historic preservation. Where applicable, the applicant must 
provide information that will enable HHS to comply with Federal historic 
preservation requirements.
    (8) Environmental information. The applicant must provide sufficient 
information to allow HHS to analyze the potential impact of the 
applicant's proposal on the environment, in accordance with the 
instructions provided with the application packet. HHS will assist 
applicants in obtaining any pertinent environmental information in the 
possession of HUD, GSA, or the landholding agency.
    (9) Local government notification. The applicant must indicate that 
it has informed the applicable unit of general local government 
responsible for providing sewer, water, police, and fire services, in 
writing of its proposed program.
    (10) Zoning and local use restrictions. The applicant must indicate 
that it will comply with all local use restrictions, including local 
building code requirements. Any applicant which applies for a lease or 
permit for a particular property is not required to comply with local 
zoning requirements. Any applicant applying for a deed of a particular 
property, pursuant to Sec. 101-47.90 9(b)(3), must comply with local 
zoning requirements, as specified in 45 CFR part 12.
    (c) Scope of evaluations. Due to the short time frame imposed for 
evaluating applications, HHS' evaluation will, generally, be limited to 
the information contained in the application.
    (d) Deadline. Completed applications must be received by DHFP, at 
the above address, within 90 days after an expression of interest is 
received from a particular applicant for that property. Upon written 
request from the applicant, HHS may grant extensions, provided that the 
appropriate landholding agency concurs with the extension. Because each 
applicant will have a different deadline based on the date the applicant 
submitted an expression of interest, applicants should contact the 
individual landholding agency to confirm that a particular property 
remains available prior to submitting an application.
    (e) Evaluations. (1) Upon receipt of an application, HHS will review 
it for completeness, and, if incomplete, may return it or ask the 
applicant to furnish any missing or additional required information 
prior to final evaluation of the application.
    (2) HHS will evaluate each completed application within 25 days of 
receipt and will promptly advise the applicant of its decision. 
Applications are evaluated on a first-come, first-serve basis. HHS will 
notify all organizations which have submitted expressions of interest 
for a particular property regarding whether the first application 
received for that property has been approved or disapproved. All 
applications will be reviewed on the basis of the following elements, 
which are listed in descending order of priority, except that paragraphs 
(e)(2)(iv) and (e)(2)(v) of this section are of equal importance.
    (i) Services offered. The extent and range of proposed services, 
such as meals, shelter, job training, and counseling.
    (ii) Need. The demand for the program and the degree to which the 
available property will be fully utilized.
    (iii) Implementation time. The amount of time necessary for the 
proposed program to become operational.
    (iv) Experience. Demonstrated prior success in operating similar 
programs and recommendations attesting to that fact by Federal, State, 
and local authorities.
    (v) Financial ability. The adequacy of funding that will likely be 
available to run the program fully and properly and to operate the 
facility.
    (3) Additional evaluation factors may be added as deemed necessary 
by HHS. If additional factors are added, the application packet will be 
revised to include a description of these additional factors.
    (4) If HHS receives one or more competing applications for a 
property within 5 days of the first application HHS

[[Page 724]]

will evaluate all completed applications simultaneously. HHS will rank 
approved applications based on the elements listed in Sec. 101-
47.908(e)(2), and notify the landholding agency, or GSA, as appropriate, 
of the relative ranks.


<R05>
Sec. 101-47.910  Action on approved applications.

    (a) Unutilized and underutilized properties. (1) When HHS approves 
an application, it will so notify the applicant and forward a copy of 
the application to the landholding agency. The landholding agency will 
execute the lease, or permit document, as appropriate, in consultation 
with the applicant.
    (2) The landholding agency maintains the discretion to decide the 
following:
    (i) The length of time the property will be available. (Leases and 
permits will be for a period of at least one year unless the applicant 
requests a shorter term.)
    (ii) Whether to grant use of the property via a lease or permit;
    (iii) The terms and conditions of the lease or permit document.
    (b) Excess and surplus properties. (1) When HHS approves an 
application, it will so notify the applicant and request that GSA assign 
the property to HHS for leasing. Upon receipt of the assignment, HHS 
will execute a lease in accordance with the procedures and requirements 
set out in 45 CFR part 12. In accordance with 41 CFR 101-47.402, custody 
and accountability of the property will remain throughout the lease term 
with the agency which initially reported the property as excess.
    (2) Prior to assignment to HHS, GSA may consider other Federal uses 
and other important national needs; however, in deciding the disposition 
of surplus real property, GSA will generally give priority of 
consideration to uses to assist the homeless. GSA may consider any 
competing request for the property made under section 203(k) of the 
Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 
484(k)) that is so meritorious and compelling that it outweighs the 
needs of the homeless, and HHS may likewise consider any competing 
request made under subsection 203(k)(1) of that law.
    (3) Whenever GSA or HHS decides in favor of a competing request over 
a request for property for homeless assistance use as provided in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the agency making the decision will 
transmit to the appropriate committees of the Congress an explanatory 
statement which details the need satisfied by conveyance of the surplus 
property, and the reasons for determining that such need was so 
meritorious and compelling as to outweigh the needs of the homeless.
    (4) Deeds. Surplus property may be conveyed to representatives of 
the homeless pursuant to section 203(k) of the Federal Property and 
Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 484(k)(1), and section 
501(f) of the McKinney Act as amended, 42 U.S.C. 11411. Representatives 
of the homeless must complete the application packet pursuant to the 
requirements of Sec. 101-47.909 of this part and in accordance with the 
requirements of 45 CFR part 12.
    (c) Completion of lease term and reversion of title. Lessees and 
grantees will be responsible for the protection and maintenance of the 
property during the time that they possess the property. Upon 
termination of the lease term or reversion of title to the Federal 
government, the lessee or grantee will be responsible for removing any 
improvements made to the property and will be responsible for 
restoration of the property. If such improvements are not removed, they 
will become the property of the Federal government. GSA or the 
landholding agency, as appropriate, will assume responsibility for 
protection and maintenance of a property when the lease terminates or 
title reverts.


<R05>
Sec. 101-47.911  Unsuitable properties.

    The landholding agency will defer, for 20 days after the date that 
notice of a property is published in the Federal Register, action to 
dispose of properties determined unsuitable for homeless assistance. HUD 
will inform landholding agencies or GSA if appeal of an unsuitability 
determination is filed by a representative of the homeless pursuant to 
Sec. 101-47.904(f)(4). HUD will advise the agency that it should refrain 
from initiating disposal procedures until HUD has completed its 
reconsideration

[[Page 725]]

process regarding unsuitability. Thereafter, or if no appeal has been 
filed after 20 days, GSA or the appropriate landholding agency may 
proceed with disposal action in accordance with applicable law.


<R05>
Sec. 101-47.912  No applications approved.

    (a) At the end of the 60 day holding period described in Sec. 101-
47.909(a), HHS will notify GSA, or the landholding agency, as 
appropriate, if an expression of interest has been received for a 
particular property. Where there is no expression of interest, GSA or 
the landholding agency, as appropriate, will proceed with disposal in 
accordance with applicable law.
    (b) Upon advice from HHS that all applications have been 
disapproved, or if no completed applications or requests for extensions 
have been received by HHS within 90 days from the date of the last 
expression of interest, disposal may proceed in accordance with 
applicable law.

Sec. 101-47.4909  Highest and best use.

    (a) Highest and best use is the most likely use to which a property 
can be put, so as to produce the highest monetary return from the 
property, promote its maximum value, or serve a public or institutional 
purpose. The highest and best use determination must be based on the 
property's economic potential, qualitative values (social and 
environmental) inherent in the property itself, and other utilization 
factors controlling or directly affecting land use (e.g. zoning, 
physical characteristics, private and public uses in the vicinity, 
neighboring improvements, utility services, access, roads, location, and 
environmental and historical considerations). Projected highest and best 
use should not be remote, speculative, or conjectural.
    (b) An analysis and determination of highest and best use is based 
on information compiled from the property inspection and environmental 
assessment. Major considerations include:

<R05>
Sec. 101-47.4913  Outline for protection and maintenance of excess and surplus real property.

    A. General. In protecting and maintaining excess and surplus 
properties, the adoption of the principle of ``calculated risk'' is 
considered to be essential. In taking what is termed a ``calculated 
risk,'' the expected losses and deteriorations in terms of realizable 
values are anticipated to be less in the overall than expenditures to 
minimize the risks. In determining the amount of protection to be 
supplied under this procedure, a number of factors should be considered; 
such as, the availability of, and the distance to, local, public, or 
private protection facilities; the size and value of the facility; 
general characteristics of structures; physical protection involving 
fencing, number of gates, etc.; the location and availability of 
communication facilities; and the amount and type of activity at the 
facility. Conditions at the various excess and surplus properties are so 
diverse that it is impracticable to establish a definite or fixed 
formula for determining the extent of protection and maintenance that 
should be applied. The standards or criteria set forth in B and C, 
below, are furnished as a guide in making such determinations.
    B. Protection Standards. The following standards are furnished as a 
guide in determining the amount and limits of protection.
    1. Properties not Requiring Protection Personnel. Fire protection or 
security personnel are not needed at:
    (a) Facilities where there are no structures or related personal 
property;
    (b) Facilities where the realizable or recoverable value of the 
improvements and related personal property subject to loss is less than 
the estimated cost of protection for a one-year period;
    (c) Facilities of little value located within public fire and police 
department limits, which can be locked or boarded up;
    (d) Facilities where the major buildings are equipped with automatic 
sprinklers, supervised by American District Telegraph Company or other 
central station service, which do not contain large quantities of 
readily removable personal property, and which are in an area patrolled 
regularly by local police; and
    (e) Facilities where agreements can be made with a lessee of a 
portion of the property to protect the remaining portions at nominal, or 
without additional cost.
    2. Properties Requiring a Resident Custodian. A resident custodian 
or guard only is required at facilities of the following classes:
    (a) Facilities containing little removable personal property but 
having a considerable number of buildings to be sold for off-site use 
when (a) the buildings are of low realizable value and so spaced that 
loss of more than a few buildings in a single fire is improbable, or (b) 
the buildings are so located that water for firefighting purposes is 
available and municipal or other fire department services will respond 
promptly;
    (b) Small, inactive industrial and commercial facilities which must 
be kept open for inspection and which are so located that public fire 
and police protection can be secured by telephone;

[[Page 734]]

    (c) Facilities where the highest and best use has been determined to 
be salvage; and
    (d) Facilities of little, or salvage, value but potentially 
dangerous and attractive to children and curiosity seekers where the 
posting of signs is not sufficient to protect the public.
    3. Properties Requiring Continuous Guard Service. One guard on duty 
at all times (a total of 5 guards required) is required at facilities of 
high market value which are fenced; require only one open gate which can 
be locked during patrols; all buildings of which can be locked; and 
where local police and fire protection can be secured by telephone.
    4. Properties Requiring High Degree of Protection. More than one 
firefighter-guard will be required to be on duty at all times at 
facilities of the classes listed below. The number, and the assignment, 
of firefighter-guards in such cases should be determined by taking into 
consideration all pertinent factors.
    (a) Facilities of high market value which are distant from public 
assistance and require an on-the-site firefighting force adequate to 
hold fires in check until outside assistance can be obtained.
    (b) Facilities of high market value which can obtain no outside 
assistance and require an on-the-site firefighting force adequate to 
extinguish fires.
    (c) Facilities of high market value at which the patrolling of large 
areas is necessary.
    (d) Facilities of high market value not fenced and containing large 
quantities of personal property of a nature inviting pilferage.
    (e) Facilities of high market value at which several gates must be 
kept open for operating purposes.
    5. Standards for All Protected Properties.
    (a) All facilities within the range of municipal or other public 
protection, but outside the geographic limits of such public body, 
should be covered by advance arrangements with appropriate authorities 
for police and fire protection service, at a monthly or other service 
fee if necessary.
    (b) Patrolling of all facilities with large areas to be protected 
should be accomplished by use of automotive vehicles.
    (c) At fenced facilities, a minimum number of gates should be kept 
open.
    6. Firefighter-Guards. Firefighters and guards are the normal means 
for carrying out the fire protection and security programs at excess and 
surplus real properties where both such programs are required. The 
duties of firefighters and guards should be combined to the maximum 
extent possible in the interest of both economy and efficiency. Such 
personnel would also be available in many cases for other miscellaneous 
services, such as, removing grass and weeds or other fire hazards, 
servicing fire extinguishers, and other activities related to general 
protection of property.
    7. Operating Requirements of Protection Units. Firefighter-guards or 
guards, should be required to make periodic rounds of facilities 
requiring protection. The frequency of these rounds would be based upon 
a number of factors; such as, location and size of the facility, type of 
structures and physical barriers, and the amount and type of activity at 
the facility. There may be instances where some form of central station 
supervision, such as American District Telegraph Company, will effect 
reduction in costs by reducing the number of firefighter-guards, or 
guards, required to adequately protect the premises.
    8. Watchman's Clock. To insure adequate coverage of the entire 
property by the guards, or firefighter-guards, an approved watchman's 
clock should be provided, with key stations strategically located so 
that, in passing from one to the other, the guards will cover all 
portions of the property.
    9. Protection Alarm Equipment. Automatic fire detection devices and 
allied equipment and services may materially assist in minimizing 
protection costs. However, use of devices of this type, like guards, are 
purely secondary fire protection and are primarily a means of obtaining 
fire and police protection facilities at the property in an emergency. 
There are various types of devices, each of which can be considered 
separately or in combination as supplementing guard patrols, which may 
assist in reduction of costs and, in some instances, it may be possible 
to eliminate all guards.
    10. Sentry Dogs. Frequently there are facilities of high market 
value, or which cover large areas, or are so isolated that they invite 
intrusion by curiosity seekers, hunters, vagrants, etc., which require 
extra or special protection measures. This has usually been taken care 
of by staffing with additional guards so that the ``buddy system'' of 
patrolling may be used. In such cases, the use of sentry dogs should be 
considered in arriving at the appropriate method of offsetting the need 
for additional guards, as well as possible reductions in personnel. If 
it is determined to be in the Government's interest to use this type of 
protection, advice should be obtained as to acquisition (lease, 
purchase, or donation), training, use, and care, from the nearest police 
department using sentry dogs. When sentry dogs are used, the property 
should be clearly posted ``Warning--This Government Property Patrolled 
by Sentry Dogs.''
    C. Maintenance Standards. The following standards or criteria are 
furnished as a guide in connection with the upkeep of excess and surplus 
real properties:

[[Page 735]]

    1. Temporary Type Buildings and Structures. Temporary buildings 
housing personal property which cannot be readily removed to permanent 
type storage should be maintained only to the extent necessary to 
protect the personal property. Vacant temporary structures should not be 
maintained except in unusual circumstances.
    2. Permanent Type Buildings and Structures. (a) No interior painting 
should be done. Where exterior wood or metal surfaces require treatment 
to prevent serious deterioration, spot painting only should be done when 
practicable.
    (b) Carpentry and glazing should be limited to: work necessary to 
close openings against weather and pilferage; making necessary repairs 
to floors, roofs, and sidewalls as a protection against further damage; 
shoring and bracing of structures to preclude structural failures; and 
similar operations.
    (c) Any necessary roofing and sheet metal repairs should, as a rule, 
be on a patch basis.
    (d) Masonry repairs, including brick, tile, and concrete 
construction, should be undertaken only to prevent leakage or 
disintegration, or to protect against imminent structural failure.
    (e) No buildings should be heated for maintenance purposes except in 
unusual circumstances.
    3. Mechanical and Electrical Installations. These include plumbing, 
heating, ventilating, air conditioning, sprinkler systems, fire alarm 
systems, electrical equipment, elevators, and similar items.
    (a) At facilities in inactive status, maintenance of mechanical and 
electrical installations should be limited to that which is necessary to 
prevent or arrest serious deterioration. In most cases, personnel should 
not be employed for this work except on a temporary basis at periodic 
intervals when it is determined by inspections that the work is 
necessary. Wherever possible electrical systems should be deenergized, 
water drained from all fixtures, heat turned off, and buildings secured 
against unauthorized entry. Sprinkler systems should be drained during 
freezing weather and reactivated when danger of freezing has passed.
    (b) At facilities in active status, such as multiple-tenancy 
operations, equipment should be kept in reasonable operating condition. 
Operation of equipment to furnish services to private tenants, as well 
as the procurement of utility services for distribution to tenants, 
should be carried on only to the extent necessary to comply with lease 
or permit conditions, or in cases where it is impracticable for tenants 
to obtain such services directly from utility companies or other 
sources.
    (c) At facilities where elevators and/or high-pressure boilers and 
related equipment are in operation, arrangements should be made for 
periodic inspections by qualified and licensed inspectors to insure that 
injury to personnel, loss of life, or damage to property does not occur.
    (d) Individual heaters should be used, when practicable, in lieu of 
operating heating plants.
    4. Grounds, Roads, Railroads, and Fencing. (a) Maintenance of 
grounds should be confined largely to removal of vegetation where 
necessary to avoid fire hazards and to control poisonous and noxious 
plant growth in accordance with local and State laws and regulations; 
plowing of fire lanes where needed; and removal of snow from roads and 
other areas only to the extent necessary to provide access for 
maintenance, fire protection, and similar activities. Wherever 
practicable, hay crops should be sold to the highest bidders with the 
purchaser performing all labor in connection with cutting and removal. 
Also, agricultural and/or grazing leases may be resorted to, if 
practicable, as other means of reducing the cost of grounds maintenance. 
Any such leases shall be subject to the provisions of Sec. 101-47.203-9 
or Sec. 101-47.312.
    (b) Only that portion of the road network necessary for firetruck 
and other minimum traffic should be maintained. The degree to which such 
roads are to be maintained should be only that necessary to permit safe 
passage at a reasonable speed.
    (c) Railroads should not be maintained except as might be required 
for protection and maintenance operations, or as required under the 
provisions of a lease or permit.
    (d) Ditches and other drainage facilities should be kept 
sufficiently clear to permit surface water to run off.
    (e) Fencing, or other physical barrier, should be kept in repair 
sufficiently to afford protection against unauthorized entry.
    5. Utilities. (a) At inactive properties, water systems, sewage 
disposal systems, electrical distribution systems, etc., should be 
maintained only to the extent necessary to provide the minimum services 
required. Buildings or areas not requiring electrical service or water 
should be deenergized electrically and the water valved off. Utilities 
not in use, or which are serving dismantled or abandoned structures, 
should not be maintained.
    (b) At active properties, water supply, electrical power, and sewage 
disposal facilities frequently must be operated at rates much below 
designed capacities. Engineering studies should determine the structural 
and operating changes necessary for maximum economy. Where leakage is 
found in water distribution lines, such lines may be valved off rather 
than repaired, unless necessary for fire protection or other purposes.
    (c) Where utilities are purchased by contract, such contracts should 
be reviewed to determine if costs can be reduced by revision of the 
contracts.

[[Page 736]]

    6. Properties to be Disposed of as Salvage. No funds should be 
expended for maintenance on properties where the highest and best use 
has been determined to be salvage.
    D. Repairs. Repairs should be limited to those additions or changes 
that are necessary for the preservation and maintenance of the property 
to deter or prevent excessive, rapid, or dangerous deterioration or 
obsolescence and to restore property damaged by storm, flood, fire, 
accident, or earthquake only where it has been determined that 
restoration is required.
    E. Improvements. No costs should be incurred to increase the sales 
value of a property, and no costs should be incurred to make a property 
disposable without the prior approval of GSA. (See Sec. 101-47.401-5.)

justifications for the intended display or official use of requested 
gifts or decorations.
    (d) [Reserved]
    (e) The transfer document shall include the following statement: 
``At such time as these items are no longer required, they will be 
reported to the General Services Administration, Property Management 
Division (FBP),

[[Page 751]]

Washington, DC 20406, and will be identified as foreign gift items and 
cross-referenced to the original excess report number.''

requirements.
    (b) There shall be a period of restriction which will expire after 
the gift or decoration has been used for the purpose stated in the 
letter of intent for a period of 10 years, except that GSA may restrict

action.
    (c) The donee shall allow the right of access to the donee's 
premises at reasonable times for inspection of the gift or decoration by 
duly authorized representatives of the State agency or the U.S. 
Government.
    (d) During the period of restriction, the donee shall not sell, 
trade, lease, lend, bail, encumber, cannibalize or dismantle for parts, 
or otherwise dispose of the property; or remove it permanently for use 
outside the State; or transfer title to the gift or decoration directly 
or indirectly; or do or allow anything to be done that would contribute 
to the gift or decoration being seized, taken into execution, attached, 
lost, stolen, damaged, or destroyed.
    (e) If, at any time during the period of restriction, the gift or 
decoration is no longer suitable, usable, or needed by the donee for the 
purpose stated in the letter of intent, the donee shall promptly notify 
the General Services Administration, Property Management Division (FBP), 
Washington, DC 20406, through the State agency, and upon demand by GSA, 
title and right to possession of the gift or decoration shall revert to

or limitation during the period of restriction, the State agency may 
demand return of the gift or decoration and, upon demand, title and 
right to possession of the gift or decoration shall revert to the U.S. 
Government. In this event, the donee shall return the gift or decoration 
in accordance with instructions furnished by the State agency, with 
costs of transportation, handling, and reasonable insurance during 
transportation to be paid by the donee or as directed by the State 
agency. If the gift or decoration is lost, stolen, or cannot legally be 
recovered or returned for any other reason, the donee shall pay

[[Page 753]]

to the U.S. Government the fair market value of the gift or decoration 
at the time of its loss, theft, or at the time that it became 
unrecoverable as determined by GSA. If the gift or decoration is damaged 
or destroyed, the State agency may require the donee to:
    (1) Return the item and pay the difference between its former fair 
market value and its current fair market value, or
    (2) Pay the fair market value, as determined by GSA, of the item had 
it not been damaged or destroyed.

    Federal Property Management Regulations Temporary Regulation H-29


To: Heads of Federal agencies
Subject: Criteria for reporting excess personal property
    1. Purpose. This regulation establishes revised criteria for 
reporting excess personal property to GSA, reduces utilization screening 
time, raises the dollar threshold for direct transfers, and updates 
addresses associated with reporting excess personal property.
    2. Effective date. This regulation is effective January 15, 1997.
    3. Expiration date. This regulation expires January 15, 1998.
    4. Applicability. This regulation applies to all executive agencies.
    5. Background.
    a. Certain excess property is reportable to GSA by executive 
agencies for the purpose of maximizing opportunities for utilization. 
Property which is reported to GSA is afforded regional and nationwide 
visibility by inclusion in GSA's automated property disposal system--the 
Federal Disposal System (FEDS). Once an item is in the FEDS nationwide 
inventory of excess and surplus property, agencies can determine the 
availability of property by phoning the supporting GSA regional office, 
obtaining a copy of the FEDS inventory listing, or by accessing an 
electronic bulletin board within FEDS containing the nationwide 
inventory--Screen by Computer and Request Excess by Electronic 
Notification (SCREEN)
    b. GSA's major personal property management customers have requested 
relief from reporting requirements by reducing the number of items of 
excess property to be reported. GSA is granting these requests provided 
such reductions do not result in an appreciable decline in overall 
transfer volumes of excess personal property. GSA conducted a study to 
assess the potential impact of reduced reporting requirements. The 
analysis showed that over 70 percent of the dollar value of property 
transferred represented Federal supply classification (FSC) groups which 
would continue to be reported to GSA as excess under the new reporting 
requirements.
    c. Changes to the reporting criteria will be reexamined after an 
implementation period of 1 year to determine their net effect on overall 
business volumes. A significant decline in the utilization rate (dollar 
value of property transfers divided by dollar value of property 
generations) would be sufficient justification for modifying or 
rescinding the regulation.
    d. GSA provided approval to the Department of Defense on July 20, 
1994, to implement throughout its nationwide network of Defense 
Reutilization and Marketing Offices (DRMO's) a streamlined disposal 
concept known as single cycle processing. Under this concept, 
utilization screening time of excess property reported to GSA is reduced 
from 60 to 21 calendar days. Federal respondents to a follow-up customer 
survey indicated that 21 calendar days is sufficient time for screening 
Department of Defense excess property. A study group consisting of GSA 
and Federal and State representatives recommended that reduced screening 
time also be applied to civilian agency excess property.
    6. Definitions. For purposes of this regulation, the following 
definitions apply:
    a. ``Reportable property'' means personal property that is required 
to be reported to GSA in accordance with FPMR 101-43.304 prior to 
disposal.
    b. ``Nonreportable property'' means any personal property that does 
not meet the reporting criteria set forth in FPMR 101-43.304, and 
therefore is not required to be reported formally to GSA, but which is 
available locally for Federal transfer or donation.
    7. Explanation of changes.
    a. Section 101-42.205 is amended by removing paragraph (b) and 
redesignating paragraph (c) as paragraph (b) and revising it to read as 
follows:
Sec. 101-42.205  Exceptions to reporting.

    (a) * * *
    (b) When EPA, under its authorities, transfers accountability for 
hazardous materials to Federal, State, and local agencies, to research 
institutions, or to commercial businesses to conduct research or to 
perform the actual cleanup of a contaminated site, the item shall not be 
reported.

[[Page 755]]

    b. Section 101-42.402 is amended by revising paragraphs (a), (b), 
and (c) and adding paragraph (d) to read as follows:
Sec. 101-42.402  Reporting hazardous materials for sale. 

                                * * * * *

    (a) Reportable property. Personal property which is reportable 
property and is identified as hazardous must be reported to a GSA 
regional office for utilization screening in accordance with Sec. 101-
42.204. If, after reporting to GSA, the hazardous materials are not 
transferred or donated, in accordance with subparts 101-42.2 through 
101-42.3 and 101-42.11, the hazardous materials will be programmed for 
sale by GSA, unless advised otherwise by the holding agency in 
accordance with part 101-45, without further documentation from the 
holding agency.
    (b) Nonreportable property. Under Sec. 101-42.202, holding agencies 
are required to identify and label hazardous materials. Listings of 
personal property which is nonreportable property and is identified as 
hazardous must be made available to GSA area utilization officers for 
local utilization and donation screening in accordance with Sec. 101-
42.204 and Sec. 101-42.205. If property has not been reported and is to 
be sold by GSA, it must be reported to GSA for sale on Standard Form 
126, Report of Personal Property for Sale, or by automated means which 
GSA is capable of accepting.
    (c) Certification and Description. The SF 126 shall contain a 
certification, executed by a duly authorized agency official, in block 
16c or as an addendum, that the item has been clearly labeled and 
packaged as required in Sec. 101-42.202(e) and 101-42.204. The SF 126 
shall also contain or be accompanied by a full description of the actual 
or potential hazard associated with handling, storage, or use of the 
item. Such description shall be furnished by providing:
    (1) An MSDS or copy thereof; or
    (2) A printed copy of the record, corresponding to the hazardous 
material being reported, from the automated HMIS; or
    (3) A written narrative, included in either block 16c or as an 
addendum, which complies with the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.1200.
    (d) Property not subject to GSA screening. Hazardous material which 
may not be reported to GSA in accordance with Sec. 101-42.204 and 
Sec. 101-42.205 shall not be reported to GSA for sale unless GSA agrees 
to conduct such sale.
    c. Section 101-43.001-30 is revised to read as follows:
Sec. 101-43.001-30  Screening period.

    Screening period means:
    (a) For reportable personal property of a civilian agency, the 
screening period is normally a period of 21 calendar days from the day 
following receipt of the automated report in FEDS or receipt of the 
manually completed report in the appropriate GSA office to and including 
the day specified as the surplus release date. For reportable property 
that is reported by a military activity during a period of property 
accumulation prior to a period of formal utilization screening, the 
screening period normally extends from the date of reporting to a period 
of 21 calendar days from the day following the date of the end of the 
accumulation.
    (b) For civilian nonreportable property, the screening period is 
normally a period of 21 calendar days from the day the property is made 
available by the holding agency for screening as excess. For military 
nonreportable property that undergoes a period of accumulation prior to 
a period of utilization screening, the screening period is normally the 
same as for reportable property.
    d. Section 101-43.001-34 is added to read as follows:
Sec. 101-43.001-34  Unit cost.

    Unit cost means the original acquisition cost of a single item of 
property.
    e. Section 101-43.302 is amended by revising paragraph (c) to read 
as follows:
Sec. 101-43.302  Agency responsibility.

                                * * * * *

    (c) GSA will assist agencies in meeting their requirements for 
nonreportable property. Federal agencies requiring such property should 
contact the appropriate GSA regional office indicated in Sec. 101-
43.4802. GSA area utilization officers, stationed at key excess 
generating points throughout the United States, screen and offer 
nonreportable property as it becomes available for transfer.

                                * * * * *

    f. Section 101-43.304-1 is amended by revising paragraph (a) to read 
as follows:
Sec. 101-43.304-1  Reporting.

    (a) Reportable property enumerated by the Federal supply 
classification (FSC) groups and classes, acquisition cost, and condition 
codes in Sec. 101-43.4801 shall be reported promptly to GSA with 
descriptions in sufficient detail to permit transfer or sale without 
further reference to the holding agency. In the absence of these 
descriptions, adequate commercial descriptions shall be substituted. 
Exceptions to these reporting requirements are covered in Sec. 101-
43.305. Whenever possible, the national stock number

[[Page 756]]

(NSN) shall be provided as part of the description. It is essential that 
the excess personal property report reflect the true condition of the 
property as of the date it is reported excess through assignment of the 
appropriate disposal condition code designation as defined in Sec. 101-
43.4801(e). Each Department of Defense excess personal property report 
must also contain the appropriate supply condition code as defined in 
Sec. 101-43.4801(f), including reports of contractor inventory so far as 
practicable. When available from property records, civilian agencies 
shall also include the appropriate supply condition code in excess 
personal property reports. To expedite processing, reports may be 
submitted up to 60 calendar days prior to the actual date of property 
availability, provided that the report clearly indicates this pending 
status and reflects the date on which the property will be determined 
excess.

                                * * * * *

    g. Section 101-43.304-2 is amended by revising paragraph (b) to read 
as follows:
Sec. 101-43.304-2  Form and distribution of reports. 

                                * * * * *

    (b) The SF 120 and SF 120A shall be submitted in an original and 
three copies. Reporting by ADP media shall be as specified and approved 
by GSA. Reports shall be directed to the GSA regional office for the 
region in which the property is located (see Sec. 101-43.4802). However, 
reports of fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft shall be submitted to the 
General Services Administration (9FB), San Francisco, CA 94102.
    h. Section 101-43.304-4 is revised to read as follows:
Sec. 101-43.304-4  Property at installations due to be discontinued. 

    Executive agencies that have installations which are due to be 
discontinued, closed, or abandoned and at which there will be excess 
personal property shall, unless inadvisable in the interest of national 
security, give advance notice of such situations as early as possible by 
letter to the appropriate GSA regional office. In such cases, agencies 
shall identify the installations to be discontinued, provide the 
scheduled date for the removal of personnel from the location, and 
specify the last date when the personal property will be needed. As soon 
as possible after filing the advance notice, the excess personal 
property shall be reported in accordance with Sec. 101-43.304-1 to 
provide time for screening for Federal utilization and donation 
purposes, within forty-two calendar days when possible.
    i. Section 101-43.305 is revised to read as follows:
Sec. 101-43.305  Nonreportable property and property not subject to GSA 
screening. 

    (a) Nonreportable property must be locally screened only, and it 
need not be reported to GSA for nationwide utilization screening. Such 
property is a valuable source of supply for Federal agencies; therefore, 
GSA regional offices and GSA area utilization officers are responsible 
for local screening of such property, for making it available to Federal 
agencies, and for its expeditious transfer. Holding agencies shall 
cooperate with GSA representatives in making information available and 
in providing access to nonreportable property. Federal agency employees 
shall be permitted access to holding installations for screening 
purposes upon presentation of a valid Federal agency employee's 
identification card.
    (b) A listing of nonreportable property, providing the extended 
value in acquisition cost dollars of each line item and the total number 
of line items on the listing, must be made available to GSA area 
utilization officers for local utilization and donation screening. 
Agencies that have computer records of their excess/surplus personal 
property are encouraged to report nonreportable property electronically, 
in lieu of submitting hardcopy listings. Agencies that are not able to 
report nonreportable property electronically, and have nonreportable 
property which is to be sold by GSA if it survives utilization and 
donation screening, are encouraged to report that property on a Standard 
Form (SF) 120, in lieu of an excess listing, to eliminate the need to 
submit SF 126, Report of Personal Property for Sale, after the 
completion of donation screening.
    (c) In accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, certain kinds 
of property are not covered by the GSA utilization screening process. 
Such property is neither reportable property nor nonreportable property. 
It is the responsibility of the owning agency to screen such property 
and make reasonable efforts to obtain utilization among other Federal 
agencies. Although not required to do so, GSA may assist in the 
screening and transfer of such property when requested to do so by the 
owning agency or when otherwise directed by GSA.
    (d) Unless otherwise directed by GSA, the following general 
categories of excess personal property are excepted from the GSA 
utilization screening process and shall not be reported to GSA for 
nationwide circularization nor made available to GSA area utilization 
officers for local screening:
    (1) Perishables, defined for the purposes of this section as any 
foodstuffs which are subject to spoilage or decay;
    (2) Property dangerous to public health and safety;

[[Page 757]]

    (3) Scrap, except aircraft in scrap condition, provided the property 
strictly conforms to the definitions for scrap found at Sec. 101-43.001-
29;
    (4) Property determined by competent authority to be classified or 
otherwise sensitive for reasons of national security;
    (5) Controlled substances in which case solicitation shall be 
limited to those agencies authorized for transfer under Sec. 101-
42.1102-3 provisions;
    (6) Reportable property which, prior to reporting as required in 
Sec. 101-43.304, is transferred directly between Federal agencies as 
provided in Sec. 101-43.309-5(a) or by prearrangement with GSA to fill a 
known need;
    (7) Trading stamps and bonus goods (see Sec. 101-25.103-4);
    (8) Nonappropriated fund property;
    (9) Nuclear Regulatory Commission-controlled materials (see 
Sec. 101-42.1102-4 and 10 CFR parts 30 through 35, 40, and 70.); and
    (10) Hazardous waste and items determined by the holding agency to 
be extremely hazardous (see Sec. 101-42.402).
Sec. 101-43.307-7  [Amended]

    j. Section 101-43.307-7 is amended by removing paragraph (a) and 
redesignating paragraph (b) as new paragraph (a) and paragraph (c) as 
new paragraph (b).
    k. Section 101-43.307-12 is amended by revising paragraphs (c), (d), 
(e), and (f) to read as follows:
Sec. 101-43.307-12  Shelf-life items.

                                * * * * *

    (c) Reportable shelf-life items which have a remaining useful life 
of 6 weeks or more before reaching the expiration date shall be reported 
as excess in accordance with Sec. 101-43.304. Agencies may, at their 
option, also report shelf-life items which are nonreportable property. 
The report shall identify the items in the description as shelf-life 
items by carrying the designation symbol ``SL'' and by showing the 
expiration date. If the item has an extendable-type expiration date, 
there shall also be furnished an indication as to whether the expiration 
date is the original or an extended date.
    (d) Normally, items reported in accordance with paragraph (c) of 
this section, including medical shelf-life items held for national 
emergency purposes, will be given a surplus release date effective 21 
calendar days from the date following the day the property was reported. 
This date may be shortened or extended according to utilization 
objectives and the remaining useful shelf life. However, GSA offices 
will screen shelf life items for both reportable property and 
nonreportable property to permit their use before the shelf life expires 
and the items are unfit for human use.
    (e) Nonreportable shelf-life items which have a remaining useful 
life of 6 weeks or more before reaching the expiration date shall be 
made available for use by other Federal agencies as provided in 
Sec. 101-43.305. Agency documents listing such items shall show the 
expiration date and, in the case of items with an extendable expiration 
date, shall indicate whether the expiration date is the original or an 
extended date. When such items are determined excess, a surplus release 
date shall be established by the holding agency providing a minimum of 
21 calendar days for utilization screening, unless determined otherwise 
by GSA. With the approval of GSA, the surplus release date may be 
extended by the holding agency when the items are selected by an 
authorized screener for transfer or are set aside by a GSA 
representative for potential or actual transfer. For controlled 
substances (as defined in Sec. 101-42.001), each executive agency shall 
comply with Sec. 101-42.1102-3.
    (f) Shelf-life items which have a remaining useful life of less than 
6 weeks, regardless of classification as reportable property or 
nonreportable property, shall be made available for utilization by other 
Federal agencies in the manner provided in paragraph (e) of this 
section.

                                * * * * *

    l. Section 101-43.307-13 is revised to read as follows:
Sec. 101-43.307-13  Medical shelf-life items held for national emergency 
purposes.

    (a) Whenever the head of an executive agency determines that the 
remaining storage or shelf-life of medical materials or supplies held 
for national emergency purposes is of too short duration to justify 
their continued retention for such purposes and that their transfer or 
disposal would be in the best interest of the United States, those 
materials or supplies shall be considered to be nonreportable property 
unless otherwise directed by GSA. To the greatest extent practicable, 
the above determination shall be made at such time as to ensure that 
such medical materials or supplies can be transferred or otherwise 
disposed of in sufficient time to permit their use before their shelf-
life expires and the items are unfit for human use.
    (b) Excess medical shelf-life items regardless of the remaining 
useful life shall be made available for use by other Federal agencies as 
provided in Sec. 101-43.305. Each agency may also report excess medical 
shelf-life items to enhance the possibility of utilization through 
increased circularization. The excess report shall identify items as 
medical shelf-life items held for national emergency purposes by 
carrying the designating symbol ``MSL'' in the description of

[[Page 758]]

the report and by showing the shelf-life expiration date. Information 
shall also be furnished regarding whether the expiration date is the 
original or the extended date. Further, whenever medical shelf-life 
items held for national emergency purposes are reported as excess, any 
specialized storage requirements pertaining to the items listed thereon 
shall be noted on the report.
    (c) When such items are determined excess, a surplus release date 
shall be established by the holding agency in accordance with Sec. 101-
43.311-2. For controlled substances (as defined in Sec. 101-42.001), 
each executive agency shall comply with Sec. 101-42.1102-3.
    (d) Transfers among Federal agencies of medical materials and 
supplies held for national emergency purposes and determined to be 
excess shall be accomplished in accordance with Sec. 101-43.309, except 
that such transfers shall be made upon such terms and prices as shall be 
agreed to by the Federal agencies concerned. Proceeds from such 
transfers may be credited to the current applicable appropriation or 
fund of the transferring agency and shall be available only for the 
purchase of medical materials or supplies for national emergency 
purposes.
    m. Section 101-43.309-2 is amended by revising paragraphs (b) and 
(d) to read as follows:
Sec. 101-43.309-2  Information on availability. 

                                * * * * *

    (b) Review of an electronic bulletin board called FEDS/SCREEN 
(Federal Disposal System/Screen by Computer and Request Excess by 
Electronic Notification) which contains information on GSA's nationwide 
inventory of excess and surplus property;

                                * * * * *

    (d) Submission of current and future requirements for excess 
personal property to the appropriate GSA regional office using GSA Form 
1539, Request for Excess Personal Property, illustrated at Sec. 101-
43.4902-1539. Instructions for submission of requirements may be 
obtained from any GSA regional office. Wherever possible, the NSN should 
be included for each item requested. GSA will assist agencies in 
obtaining NSN's to the extent practicable. If substitute items are 
acceptable, these should also be identified by NSN. Requirements for NSN 
items may be submitted electronically. If not currently available as 
excess, property requirements identified by NSN's will be retained for 
approximately 180 calendar days. Property reported excess during this 
time, if matched with recorded requirements, will be offered for 
immediate transfer. Agencies should update their lists of items at the 
end of each 180-calendar-day period to retain visibility in the 
requirements bank.
    n. Section 101-43.309-5 is amended by revising paragraph (a) to read 
as follows:
Sec. 101-43.309-5  Procedure for effecting transfers.

    (a) All transfers of excess personal property between Federal 
agencies shall be by SF 122, Transfer Order Excess Personal Property 
(see Sec. 101-43.4901-122), or any other transfer order form approved by 
GSA. Automated requests on approved forms and automated requests 
generated by FEDS/SCREEN may be used for excess personal property 
transfers. However, Federal agencies using automated requests shall 
ensure that document numbers are controlled and records maintained 
indicating the official authorized to approve property transfers. Except 
for automated transfer orders generated by FEDS/SCREEN, each transferee 
agency shall forward the original and three copies of the transfer order 
to the appropriate GSA regional office (see Sec. 101-43.4802) for 
approval. A SF 120 is not required in addition to SF 122 for direct 
transfers. Prior approval by GSA is not required when the appropriate 
GSA regional office is furnished an information copy of each direct 
transfer order by the transferor agency within 10 workdays from receipt 
of the order, and the property involved in the given transaction is:
    (1) Reportable property under Sec. 101-43.304 but has not yet been 
reported to GSA, the total acquisition cost of the transfer order does 
not exceed $10,000, and the owning agency's regulations relative to 
internal distribution have been satisfied; or
    (2) Nonreportable property under Sec. 101-43.305 and has not been 
reserved at the holding location for special screening by the 
appropriate GSA regional office, and the total acquisition cost of the 
transfer order does not exceed $50,000.

                                * * * * *

    o. Section 101-43.311-1 is revised to read as follows:
Sec. 101-43.311-1  Reportable property.

    (a) Excess personal property, which is reported to GSA in accordance 
with Sec. 101-43.304 and not transferred to other Federal agencies shall 
become surplus at the close of business on the surplus release date, 
which is indicated on the report of excess personal property to GSA. 
With the exception of aircraft and vessels, the surplus release date 
will normally be 21 calendar days from the day after GSA receives the 
report of the excess personal property. The surplus release date for 
aircraft, and for vessels 1,500 gross tons and under in FSC Group 19, 
will be 60 calendar days from the day after GSA receives the report of 
excess in the appropriate GSA regional office.
    (b) GSA may expedite screening by shortening the period of 
utilization screening for

[[Page 759]]

items individually or by FSC class which have a history of little 
demand. GSA may extend the screening period to adequately screen large 
generations or specialized items. The appropriate GSA regional office 
will coordinate surplus release date changes with the reporting activity 
to minimize impact on the utilization and disposal process. Agencies may 
not shorten or lengthen screening periods on their own.
    p. Section 101-43.311-2 is amended by revising paragraph (a) and 
removing paragraph (c) to read as follows:
Sec. 101-43.311-2  Nonreportable property.

    (a) Nonreportable property shall become surplus when it has been 
made available by the holding agency for Federal use for a minimum of 21 
calendar days from the date made available for screening to Federal 
agencies, unless determined otherwise by GSA, and has not been selected 
for transfer by another Federal agency. Holding agencies shall annotate 
property records with the date of the agency excess determination. 
Authorized Federal agency representatives may request and, with the 
approval of GSA, holding agencies will grant additional screening time 
not to exceed 30 calendar days, unless otherwise agreed upon by the 
holding agency and the GSA regional office concerned. GSA may shorten or 
lengthen the screening time.

                                * * * * *

    q. Section 101-43.314 is amended by revising paragraph (b)(2)(iv) to 
read as follows:
Sec. 101-43.314  Use of excess personal property on grants. 

                                * * * * *

    (b) * * *
    (2) * * *
    (iv) Excess scientific equipment transferred pursuant to section 
11(e) of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 
U.S.C. 1870(e)). GSA will consider items of personal property as 
scientific equipment for transfer without reimbursement to the National 
Science Foundation (NSF) for use by a project grantee when the property 
requested is within FSC groups 12 (Fire Control Equipment), 14 (Guided 
Missiles), 43 (Pumps and Compressors), 48 (Valves), 58 (Communication, 
Detection, and Coherent Radiation Equipment), 59 (Electrical and 
Electronic Equipment Components), 65 (Medical, Dental, and Veterinary 
Equipment and Supplies), 66 (Instruments and Laboratory Equipment), 67 
(Photographic Equipment), 68 (Chemicals and Chemical Products), or 70 
(General Purpose Information Processing Equipment (Including Firmware), 
Software, Supplies, and Support Equipment). GSA will give consideration 
to transfer without reimbursement of items of excess property in other 
FSC groups when NSF certifies the item requested is a component of or 
related to a piece of scientific equipment or is an otherwise difficult-
to-acquire item needed for scientific research. Items of property 
determined by GSA to be common use or general purpose property, 
regardless of classification, shall not be transferred to NSF for use by 
a project grantee without reimbursement.

                                * * * * *

    r. Section 101-43.4801 is amended by revising paragraphs (a) through 
(d) to read as follows:
Sec. 101-43.4801  Excess personal property reporting requirements.

    (a) The table shown in paragraph (d) of this section shows the 
excess personal property Federal Supply Classification (FSC) groups and 
classes comprising reportable property. Property in these groups and 
classes must be reported to GSA when the following condition code and 
dollar threshold criteria are met:
    (1) With the exception of aircraft, the condition code as defined in 
paragraph (e) of this section is salvage or better. Fixed-wing and 
rotary-wing aircraft, airframe structural components, and aircraft 
engines, as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, are reportable 
regardless of condition in accordance with Sec. 101-43.304-2.
    (2) The unit cost, measured in acquisition dollars, is $5,000 or 
more.
    (b) With respect to aircraft and aircraft components and 
accessories:
    (1) As indicated in the table in paragraph (d) of this section, line 
items in FSC classes 1510, 1520, 1560, 2810, 2840, or any class in FSC 
group 16 shall be reported. In agencies other than the Department of 
Defense, all line items in these classes shall be reported regardless of 
condition code when dollar criteria are met. For the Department of 
Defense, aircraft in FSC class 1510 which are in the Cargo/Transport, 
Observation, Anti-sub, Trainer, or Utility series, all aircraft in FSC 
class 1520, and line items in other classes which are components of 
these aircraft shall be reported regardless of condition code when 
dollar criteria are met.
    (2) Items in FSC classes 1510 and 1520 held by the Department of 
Defense or other agencies shall be reported to the General Services 
Administration (9FB), San Francisco, California 94102.
    (c) All excess Government-owned information technology (IT) 
equipment and software, as defined in subpart 101-43.6, shall be 
disposed of in accordance with the provisions of that subpart.
    (d) The following table shows FSC groups and classes which comprise 
reportable property:

    t. Section 101-44.109 is amended by revising paragraphs (a) and (b) 
to read as follows:
Sec. 101-44.109  Donation screening period.

    (a) Unless otherwise directed by GSA, a period of 21 calendar days 
following the surplus release date (see Sec. 101-43.001-32) shall be 
provided to set aside surplus reportable and nonreportable property 
determined to be usable and necessary for donation purposes in 
accordance with the provisions of subparts 101-44.2, 101-44.4, and 101-
44.5. Reportable surplus property will be set aside for donation when a 
Standard Form 123, with an informational copy to the holding activity, 
is submitted to a GSA regional office for approval within the donation 
screening period. Nonreportable property will be set aside for donation 
upon notification to a holding activity within the donation screening 
period by a responsible Federal official, a State agency representative,

   Federal Property Management Regulations, Temporary Regulation H-30

To: Heads of Federal agencies
Subject: Donation of Federal surplus personal property to nonprofit 
          providers of assistance to impoverished families and 
          individuals
    1. Purpose. This regulation expands eligibility for the Federal 
surplus personal property donation program to include nonprofit 
organizations that provide food, clothing, housing, or other assistance 
to families or individuals with incomes below the poverty line.
    2. Effective date. This regulation is effective upon publication in 
the Federal Register.
    3. Expiration date. This regulation expires 2 years from the 
effective date. Prior to the expiration date, this regulation will be 
codified in a new regulation named the Federal Property and 
Administrative Services Regulation (FPASR). The FPASR will replace the 
Federal Property Management Regulations and appear in 41 CFR Chapter 
102.
    4. Applicability. The provisions of this regulation apply to all 
State agencies as defined in FPMR 101-44.001-14. Such agencies must 
follow this regulation and other guidelines in FPMR 101-44.207 when 
determining an applicant's eligibility as a nonprofit provider.
    5. Background. Section 1 of Public Law 105-50, signed by the 
President on October 6, 1997, amended section 203(j)(3)(B) of the 
Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of

[[Page 762]]

1949, as amended, to add nonprofit organizations that provide assistance 
to the impoverished to the list of organizations eligible to acquire 
surplus personal property for educational or public health purposes. 
Legislative history indicates the intent of this section was to provide 
surplus property eligibility to charitable organizations such as food 
banks, Habitat for Humanity, and the Salvation Army. See 143 Cong. Rec. 
H1941 (daily ed. April 29, 1997) (statement of Rep. Horn). These groups 
provide goods and services that contribute to the educational growth or 
general health and well-being of individuals and families below the 
poverty line. FPMR 101-44.207 is amended to make such providers eligible 
for Federal surplus personal property donations.
    6. Explanation of changes. Section 101-44.207 is amended by adding 
paragraph (a)(18.2) and revising paragraph (c) to read as follows:

Sec. 101-44.207  Eligibility.

                                * * * * *

    (a) * * *
    (18.2)  Provider of assistance to impoverished families and 
individuals means a public or private, nonprofit tax-exempt organization 
whose primary function is to provide money, goods, or services to 
families or individuals whose annual incomes are below the poverty line 
(as defined in section 673 of the Community Services Block Grant Act) 
(42 U.S.C. 9902). Providers include food banks, self-help housing 
groups, and organizations providing services such as the following: 
Health care; medical transportation; scholarships and tuition 
assistance; tutoring and literacy instruction; job training and 
placement; employment counseling; child care assistance; meals or other 
nutritional support; clothing distribution; home construction or 
repairs; utility or rental assistance; and legal counsel.

                                * * * * *

    (c) Eligibility of nonprofit tax-exempt activities. Surplus personal 
property may be donated through the State agency to nonprofit tax-exempt 
activities, as defined in this section, within the State, such as:
    (1) Medical institutions;
    (2) Hospitals;
    (3) Clinics;
    (4) Health centers;
    (5) Providers of assistance to homeless individuals;
    (6) Providers of assistance to impoverished families and 
individuals;
    (7) Schools;
    (8) Colleges;
    (9) Universities;
    (10) Schools for the mentally retarded;
    (11) Schools for the physically handicapped;
    (12) Child care centers;
    (13) Radio and television stations licensed by the Federal 
Communications Commission as educational radio or educational television 
stations;
    (14) Museums attended by the public;
    (15) Libraries, serving free all residents of a community, district, 
State or region; or
    (16) Organizations or institutions that receive funds appropriated 
for programs for older individuals under the Older Americans Act of 
1965, as amended, under title IV and title XX of the Social Security 
Act, or under titles VIII and X of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 
and the Community Services Block Grant Act. Programs for older 
individuals include services that are necessary for the general welfare 
of older individuals, such as social services, transportation services, 
nutrition services, legal services, and multipurpose senior centers.
    7. Effect on other directives. This regulation modifies the 
regulations appearing in paragraphs (a) and (c) of FPMR 101-44.207.
