                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, July 1, 2011), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page viii]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
April 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in eleven separate 
volumes. For the period beginning April 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

``[RESERVED]'' TERMINOLOGY

    The term ``[Reserved]'' is used as a place holder within the Code of 
Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a 
``[Reserved]'' location at any time. Occasionally ``[Reserved]'' is used 
editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and 
not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as 
an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that 
issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after 
contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please 
notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and 
Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, 
or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities 
and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an 
alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in 
this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.

[[Page ix]]

    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

Sec. 96.4  Applicability.

    (a) The following units in a State shall be NO<INF>X</INF> Budget 
units, and any source that includes one or more such units shall be a 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget source, subject to the requirements of this part:
    (1) Any unit that, any time on or after January 1, 1995, serves a 
generator with a nameplate capacity greater than 25 MWe and sells any 
amount of electricity; or
    (2) Any unit that is not a unit under paragraph (a) of this section 
and that has a maximum design heat input greater than 250 mmBtu/hr.
    (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, a unit under 
paragraph (a) of this section shall be subject only to the requirements 
of this paragraph (b) if the unit has a federally enforceable permit 
that meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section and 
restricts the unit to burning only natural gas or fuel oil during a 
control period in 2003 or later and each control period thereafter and 
restricts the unit's operating hours during each such control period to 
the number of hours (determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(ii) 
and (iii) of this section) that limits the unit's potential 
NO<INF>X</INF> mass emissions for the control period to 25 tons or less. 
Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, starting with the 
effective date of such federally enforceable permit, the unit shall not 
be a NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit.
    (1) For each control period under paragraph (b) of this section, the 
federally enforceable permit must:
    (i) Restrict the unit to burning only natural gas or fuel oil.
    (ii) Restrict the unit's operating hours to the number calculated by 
dividing 25 tons of potential NO<INF>X</INF> mass emissions by the 
unit's maximum potential hourly NO<INF>X</INF> mass emissions.
    (iii) Require that the unit's potential NO<INF>X</INF> mass 
emissions shall be calculated as follows:
    (A) Select the default NO<INF>X</INF> emission rate in Table 2 of 
Sec. 75.19 of this chapter that would otherwise be applicable assuming 
that the unit burns only the type of fuel (i.e., only natural gas or 
only fuel oil) that has the highest default NO<INF>X</INF> emission 
factor of any type of fuel that the unit is allowed to burn under the 
fuel use restriction in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section; and
    (B) Multiply the default NO<INF>X</INF> emission rate under 
paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(A) of this section by the unit's maximum rated 
hourly heat input. The owner or operator of the unit may petition the 
permitting authority to use a lower value for the unit's maximum rated 
hourly heat input than the value as defined under Sec. 96.2. The 
permitting authority may approve such lower value if the owner or 
operator demonstrates that the maximum hourly heat input specified by 
the manufacturer or the highest observed hourly heat input, or both, are 
not representative, and that such lower value is representative, of the 
unit's current capabilities because modifications have been made to the 
unit, limiting its capacity permanently.
    (iv) Require that the owner or operator of the unit shall retain at 
the source that includes the unit, for 5 years, records demonstrating 
that the

[[Page 15]]

operating hours restriction, the fuel use restriction, and the other 
requirements of the permit related to these restrictions were met.
    (v) Require that the owner or operator of the unit shall report the 
unit's hours of operation (treating any partial hour of operation as a 
whole hour of operation) during each control period to the permitting 
authority by November 1 of each year for which the unit is subject to 
the federally enforceable permit.
    (2) The permitting authority that issues the federally enforceable 
permit with the fuel use restriction under paragraph (b)(1)(i) and the 
operating hours restriction under paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) and (iii) of 
this section will notify the Administrator in writing of each unit under 
paragraph (a) of this section whose federally enforceable permit issued 
by the permitting authority includes such restrictions. The permitting 
authority will also notify the Administrator in writing of each unit 
under paragraph (a) of this section whose federally enforceable permit 
issued by the permitting authority is revised to remove any such 
restriction, whose federally enforceable permit issued by the permitting 
authority includes any such restriction that is no longer applicable, or 
which does not comply with any such restriction.
    (3) If, for any control period under paragraph (b) of this section, 
the fuel use restriction under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section or 
the operating hours restriction under paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) and (iii) of 
this section is removed from the unit's federally enforceable permit or 
otherwise becomes no longer applicable or if, for any such control 
period, the unit does not comply with the fuel use restriction under 
paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section or the operating hours restriction 
under paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section, the unit shall be 
a NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit, subject to the requirements of this part. 
Such unit shall be treated as commencing operation and, for a unit under 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section, commencing commercial operation on 
September 30 of the control period for which the fuel use restriction or 
the operating hours restriction is no longer applicable or during which 
the unit does not comply with the fuel use restriction or the operating 
hours restriction.

<R05>
Sec. 96.42  NOX allowance allocations.

    (a)(1) The heat input (in mmBtu) used for calculating NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowance allocations for each NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit under Sec. 
96.4 will be:
    (i) For a NO<INF>X</INF> allowance allocation under Sec. 96.41(a), 
the average of the two highest amounts of the unit's heat input for the 
control periods in 1995, 1996, and 1997 if the unit is under Sec. 
96.4(a)(1) or the control period in 1995 if the unit is under Sec. 
96.4(a)(2); and
    (ii) For a NO<INF>X</INF> allowance allocation under Sec. 96.41(b), 
the unit's heat input for the control period in the year that is four 
years before the year for which the NO<INF>X</INF> allocation is being 
calculated.
    (2) The unit's total heat input for the control period in each year 
specified under paragraph (a)(1) of this section will be determined in 
accordance with part 75 of this chapter if the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget 
unit was otherwise subject to the requirements of part 75 of this 
chapter for the year, or will be based on the best available data 
reported to the permitting authority for the unit if the unit was not 
otherwise subject to the requirements of part 75 of this chapter for the 
year.
    (b) For each control period under Sec. 96.41, the permitting 
authority will allocate to all NO<INF>X</INF> Budget units under Sec. 
96.4(a)(1) in the State that commenced operation before May 1 of the 
period used to calculate heat input under paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section, a total number of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances equal to 95 percent 
in 2003, 2004, and 2005, or 98 percent thereafter, of the tons of 
NO<INF>X</INF> emissions in the State trading program budget apportioned 
to electric generating units under Sec. 96.40 in accordance with the 
following procedures:
    (1) The permitting authority will allocate NO<INF>X</INF> allowances 
to each NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit under Sec. 96.4(a)(1) in an amount 
equaling 0.15 lb/mmBtu multiplied by the heat input determined under 
paragraph (a) of this section, rounded to the nearest whole 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowance as appropriate.
    (2) If the initial total number of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances 
allocated to all NO<INF>X</INF> Budget units under Sec. 96.4(a)(1) in 
the State for a control period under paragraph (b)(1) of this section 
does not equal 95 percent in 2003, 2004, and 2005, or 98 percent 
thereafter, of the number of tons of NO<INF>X</INF> emissions in the 
State trading program budget apportioned to electric generating units, 
the permitting authority will adjust the total number of NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances allocated to all such NO<INF>X</INF> Budget units for the 
control period under paragraph (b)(1) of this section so that the total 
number of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances allocated equals 95 percent in 2003, 
2004, and 2005, or 98 percent thereafter, of the number of tons of 
NO<INF>X</INF> emissions in the State trading program budget apportioned 
to electric generating units. This adjustment will be made by: 
multiplying each unit's allocation by 95 percent in 2003, 2004, and 
2005, or 98 percent thereafter, of the number of tons of NO<INF>X</INF> 
emissions in the State trading program budget apportioned to electric 
generating units divided by the total number of NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances allocated under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and 
rounding to the nearest whole NO<INF>X</INF> allowance as appropriate.
    (c) For each control period under Sec. 96.41, the permitting 
authority will allocate to all NO<INF>X</INF> Budget units under Sec. 
96.4(a)(2) in the State that commenced operation before May 1 of the 
period used to calculate heat input under paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section, a total number of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances equal to 95 percent 
in 2003, 2004, and 2005, or 98 percent thereafter, of the tons of 
NO<INF>X</INF> emissions in the State trading program budget apportioned 
to non-electric generating units under Sec. 96.40 in accordance with 
the following procedures:
    (1) The permitting authority will allocate NO<INF>X</INF> allowances 
to each NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit under Sec. 96.4(a)(2) in an amount 
equaling 0.17 lb/mmBtu multiplied by the heat input determined under 
paragraph (a) of this section, rounded to the nearest whole 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowance as appropriate.
    (2) If the initial total number of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances 
allocated to all NO<INF>X</INF> Budget units under Sec. 96.4(a)(2) in 
the State for a control period under paragraph (c)(1) of this section 
does not equal 95 percent in 2003, 2004, and 2005, or 98 percent 
thereafter, of the number of tons of NO<INF>X</INF> emissions in the 
State trading program budget apportioned to non-electric generating 
units, the permitting authority will adjust the total number of 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances allocated to

[[Page 26]]

all such NO<INF>X</INF> Budget units for the control period under 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section so that the total number of 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances allocated equals 95 percent in 2003, 2004, and 
2005, or 98 percent thereafter, of the number of tons of NO<INF>X</INF> 
emissions in the State trading program budget apportioned to non-
electric generating units. This adjustment will be made by: multiplying 
each unit's allocation by 95 percent in 2003, 2004, and 2005, or 98 
percent thereafter, of the number of tons of NO<INF>X</INF> emissions in 
the State trading program budget apportioned to non-electric generating 
units divided by the total number of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances allocated 
under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and rounding to the nearest 
whole NO<INF>X</INF> allowance as appropriate.
    (d) For each control period under Sec. 96.41, the permitting 
authority will allocate NO<INF>X</INF> allowances to NO<INF>X</INF> 
Budget units under Sec. 96.4 in the State that commenced operation, or 
is projected to commence operation, on or after May 1 of the period used 
to calculate heat input under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, in 
accordance with the following procedures:
    (1) The permitting authority will establish one allocation set-aside 
for each control period. Each allocation set-aside will be allocated 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances equal to 5 percent in 2003, 2004, and 2005, or 
2 percent thereafter, of the tons of NO<INF>X</INF> emissions in the 
State trading program budget under Sec. 96.40, rounded to the nearest 
whole NO<INF>X</INF> allowance as appropriate.
    (2) The NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account representative of a 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit under paragraph (d) of this section may 
submit to the permitting authority a request, in writing or in a format 
specified by the permitting authority, to be allocated NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances for no more than five consecutive control periods under Sec. 
96.41, starting with the control period during which the NO<INF>X</INF> 
Budget unit commenced, or is projected to commence, operation and ending 
with the control period preceding the control period for which it will 
receive an allocation under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section. The 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowance allocation request must be submitted prior to 
May 1 of the first control period for which the NO<INF>X</INF> allowance 
allocation is requested and after the date on which the permitting 
authority issues a permit to construct the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit.
    (3) In a NO<INF>X</INF> allowance allocation request under paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section, the NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account 
representative for units under Sec. 96.4(a)(1) may request for a 
control period NO<INF>X</INF> allowances in an amount that does not 
exceed 0.15 lb/mmBtu multiplied by the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit's 
maximum design heat input (in mmBtu/hr) multiplied by the number of 
hours remaining in the control period starting with the first day in the 
control period on which the unit operated or is projected to operate.
    (4) In a NO<INF>X</INF> allowance allocation request under paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section, the NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account 
representative for units under Sec. 96.4(a)(2) may request for a 
control period NO<INF>X</INF> allowances in an amount that does not 
exceed 0.17 lb/mmBtu multiplied by the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit's 
maximum design heat input (in mmBtu/hr) multiplied by the number of 
hours remaining in the control period starting with the first day in the 
control period on which the unit operated or is projected to operate.
    (5) The permitting authority will review, and allocate 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances pursuant to, each NO<INF>X</INF> allowance 
allocation request under paragraph (d)(2) of this section in the order 
that the request is received by the permitting authority.
    (i) Upon receipt of the NO<INF>X</INF> allowance allocation request, 
the permitting authority will determine whether, and will make any 
necessary adjustments to the request to ensure that, for units under 
Sec. 96.4(a)(1), the control period and the number of allowances 
specified are consistent with the requirements of paragraphs (d)(2) and 
(3) of this section and, for units under Sec. 96.4(a)(2), the control 
period and the number of allowances specified are consistent with the 
requirements of paragraphs (d)(2) and (4) of this section.
    (ii) If the allocation set-aside for the control period for which 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances are requested has an amount of NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances not less than the number requested (as adjusted under 
paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section), the permitting authority will 
allocate the

[[Page 27]]

amount of the NO<INF>X</INF> allowances requested (as adjusted under 
paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section) to the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit.
    (iii) If the allocation set-aside for the control period for which 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances are requested has a smaller amount of 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances than the number requested (as adjusted under 
paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section), the permitting authority will deny 
in part the request and allocate only the remaining number of 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances in the allocation set-aside to the 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit.
    (iv) Once an allocation set-aside for a control period has been 
depleted of all NO<INF>X</INF> allowances, the permitting authority will 
deny, and will not allocate any NO<INF>X</INF> allowances pursuant to, 
any NO<INF>X</INF> allowance allocation request under which 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances have not already been allocated for the 
control period.
    (6) Within 60 days of receipt of a NO<INF>X</INF> allowance 
allocation request, the permitting authority will take appropriate 
action under paragraph (d)(5) of this section and notify the 
NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account representative that submitted the 
request and the Administrator of the number of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances 
(if any) allocated for the control period to the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget 
unit.
    (e) For a NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit that is allocated 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances under paragraph (d) of this section for a 
control period, the Administrator will deduct NO<INF>X</INF> allowances 
under Sec. 96.54(b) or (e) to account for the actual utilization of the 
unit during the control period. The Administrator will calculate the 
number of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances to be deducted to account for the 
unit's actual utilization using the following formulas and rounding to 
the nearest whole NO<INF>X</INF> allowance as appropriate, provided that 
the number of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances to be deducted shall be zero if 
the number calculated is less than zero:

NO<INF>X</INF> allowances deducted for actual utilization for units 
    under Sec. 96.4(a)(1) = (Unit's NO<INF>X</INF> allowances allocated 
    for control period)-(Unit's actual control period utilization x 0.15 
    lb/mmBtu); and
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances deducted for actual utilization for units 
    under Sec. 96.4(a)(2) = (Unit's NO<INF>X</INF> allowances allocated 
    for control period)-(Unit's actual control period utilization x 0.17 
    lb/mmBtu)

Where:

``Unit's NO<INF>X</INF> allowances allocated for control period'' is the 
number of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances allocated to the unit for the 
control period under paragraph (d) of this section; and
``Unit's actual control period utilization'' is the utilization (in 
mmBtu), as defined in Sec. 96.2, of the unit during the control period.

    (f) After making the deductions for compliance under Sec. 96.54(b) 
or (e) for a control period, the Administrator will notify the 
permitting authority whether any NO<INF>X</INF> allowances remain in the 
allocation set-aside for the control period. The permitting authority 
will allocate any such NO<INF>X</INF> allowances to the NO<INF>X</INF> 
Budget units in the State using the following formula and rounding to 
the nearest whole NO<INF>X</INF> allowance as appropriate:

Unit's share of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances remaining in allocation set-
    aside = Total NO<INF>X</INF> allowances remaining in allocation set-
    aside x (Unit's NO<INF>X</INF> allowance allocation / State trading 
    program budget excluding allocation set-aside)

Where:

``Total NO<INF>X</INF> allowances remaining in allocation set-aside'' is 
the total number of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances remaining in the 
allocation set-aside for the control period to which the allocation set-
aside applies;
``Unit's NO<INF>X</INF> allowance allocation'' is the number of 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances allocated under paragraph (b) or (c) of this 
section to the unit for the control period to which the allocation set-
aside applies; and
``State trading program budget excluding allocation set-aside'' is the 
State trading program budget under Sec. 96.40 for the control period to 
which the allocation set-aside applies multiplied by 95 percent if the 
control period is in 2003, 2004, or 2005 or 98 percent if the control 
period is in any year thereafter, rounded to the nearest whole 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowance as appropriate.

    (iii) The Administrator will not adjudicate any private legal 
dispute concerning the authorization or any representation, action, 
inaction, or submission of the NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account 
representative or any alternate NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account 
representative for a general account, including private legal disputes 
concerning the proceeds of NO<INF>X</INF> allowance transfers.
    (c) Account identification. The Administrator will assign a unique 
identifying number to each account established under paragraph (a) or 
(b) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 96.52  NOX Allowance Tracking System responsibilities of NOX 
authorized account representative.

    (a) Following the establishment of a NO<INF>X</INF> Allowance 
Tracking System account, all submissions to the Administrator pertaining 
to the account, including, but not limited to, submissions concerning 
the deduction or transfer of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances in the account, 
shall be made only by the NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account 
representative for the account.
    (b) Authorized account representative identification. The 
Administrator will assign a unique identifying number to each 
NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account representative.


<R05>
Sec. 96.53  Recordation of NOX allowance allocations.

    (a) The Administrator will record the NO<INF>X</INF> allowances for 
2003 in the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget units' compliance accounts and the 
allocation set-asides, as allocated under subpart E of this part. The 
Administrator will also record the NO<INF>X</INF> allowances allocated 
under Sec. 96.88(a)(1) for each NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in source in 
its compliance account.
    (b) Each year, after the Administrator has made all deductions from 
a NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit's compliance account and the overdraft 
account pursuant to Sec. 96.54, the Administrator will record 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances, as allocated to the unit under subpart E of 
this part or under Sec. 96.88(a)(2), in the compliance account for the 
year after the last year for which allowances were previously allocated 
to the compliance account. Each year, the Administrator will also record 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances, as allocated under subpart E of this part, in 
the allocation set-aside for the year after the last year for which 
allowances were

[[Page 31]]

previously allocated to an allocation set-aside.
    (c) Serial numbers for allocated NO<INF>X</INF> allowances. When 
allocating NO<INF>X</INF> allowances to and recording them in an 
account, the Administrator will assign each NO<INF>X</INF> allowance a 
unique identification number that will include digits identifying the 
year for which the NO<INF>X</INF> allowance is allocated.


<R05>
Sec. 96.54  Compliance.

    (a) NO<INF>X</INF> allowance transfer deadline. The NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances are available to be deducted for compliance with a unit's 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget emissions limitation for a control period in a 
given year only if the NO<INF>X</INF> allowances:
    (1) Were allocated for a control period in a prior year or the same 
year; and
    (2) Are held in the unit's compliance account, or the overdraft 
account of the source where the unit is located, as of the 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowance transfer deadline for that control period or 
are transferred into the compliance account or overdraft account by a 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowance transfer correctly submitted for recordation 
under Sec. 96.60 by the NO<INF>X</INF> allowance transfer deadline for 
that control period.
    (b) Deductions for compliance. (1) Following the recordation, in 
accordance with Sec. 96.61, of NO<INF>X</INF> allowance transfers 
submitted for recordation in the unit's compliance account or the 
overdraft account of the source where the unit is located by the 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowance transfer deadline for a control period, the 
Administrator will deduct NO<INF>X</INF> allowances available under 
paragraph (a) of this section to cover the unit's NO<INF>X</INF> 
emissions (as determined in accordance with subpart H of this part), or 
to account for actual utilization under Sec. 96.42(e), for the control 
period:
    (i) From the compliance account; and
    (ii) Only if no more NO<INF>X</INF> allowances available under 
paragraph (a) of this section remain in the compliance account, from the 
overdraft account. In deducting allowances for units at the source from 
the overdraft account, the Administrator will begin with the unit having 
the compliance account with the lowest NO<INF>X</INF> Allowance Tracking 
System account number and end with the unit having the compliance 
account with the highest NO<INF>X</INF> Allowance Tracking System 
account number (with account numbers sorted beginning with the left-most 
character and ending with the right-most character and the letter 
characters assigned values in alphabetical order and less than all 
numeric characters).
    (2) The Administrator will deduct NO<INF>X</INF> allowances first 
under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section and then under paragraph 
(b)(1)(ii) of this section:
    (i) Until the number of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances deducted for the 
control period equals the number of tons of NO<INF>X</INF> emissions, 
determined in accordance with subpart H of this part, from the unit for 
the control period for which compliance is being determined, plus the 
number of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances required for deduction to account 
for actual utilization under Sec. 96.42(e) for the control period; or
    (ii) Until no more NO<INF>X</INF> allowances available under 
paragraph (a) of this section remain in the respective account.
    (c)(1) Identification of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances by serial number. 
The NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account representative for each compliance 
account may identify by serial number the NO<INF>X</INF> allowances to 
be deducted from the unit's compliance account under paragraph (b), (d), 
or (e) of this section. Such identification shall be made in the 
compliance certification report submitted in accordance with Sec. 
96.30.
    (2) First-in, first-out. The Administrator will deduct 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances for a control period from the compliance 
account, in the absence of an identification or in the case of a partial 
identification of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances by serial number under 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section, or the overdraft account on a first-
in, first-out (FIFO) accounting basis in the following order:
    (i) Those NO<INF>X</INF> allowances that were allocated for the 
control period to the unit under subpart E or I of this part;
    (ii) Those NO<INF>X</INF> allowances that were allocated for the 
control period to any unit and transferred and recorded in the account 
pursuant to subpart G of this part, in order of their date of 
recordation;
    (iii) Those NO<INF>X</INF> allowances that were allocated for a 
prior control period to

[[Page 32]]

the unit under subpart E or I of this part; and
    (iv) Those NO<INF>X</INF> allowances that were allocated for a prior 
control period to any unit and transferred and recorded in the account 
pursuant to subpart G of this part, in order of their date of 
recordation.
    (d) Deductions for excess emissions. (1) After making the deductions 
for compliance under paragraph (b) of this section, the Administrator 
will deduct from the unit's compliance account or the overdraft account 
of the source where the unit is located a number of NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances, allocated for a control period after the control period in 
which the unit has excess emissions, equal to three times the number of 
the unit's excess emissions.
    (2) If the compliance account or overdraft account does not contain 
sufficient NO<INF>X</INF> allowances, the Administrator will deduct the 
required number of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances, regardless of the control 
period for which they were allocated, whenever NO<INF>X</INF> allowances 
are recorded in either account.
    (3) Any allowance deduction required under paragraph (d) of this 
section shall not affect the liability of the owners and operators of 
the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit for any fine, penalty, or assessment, or 
their obligation to comply with any other remedy, for the same 
violation, as ordered under the CAA or applicable State law. The 
following guidelines will be followed in assessing fines, penalties or 
other obligations:
    (i) For purposes of determining the number of days of violation, if 
a NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit has excess emissions for a control period, 
each day in the control period (153 days) constitutes a day in violation 
unless the owners and operators of the unit demonstrate that a lesser 
number of days should be considered.
    (ii) Each ton of excess emissions is a separate violation.
    (e) Deductions for units sharing a common stack. In the case of 
units sharing a common stack and having emissions that are not 
separately monitored or apportioned in accordance with subpart H of this 
part:
    (1) The NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account representative of the 
units may identify the percentage of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances to be 
deducted from each such unit's compliance account to cover the unit's 
share of NO<INF>X</INF> emissions from the common stack for a control 
period. Such identification shall be made in the compliance 
certification report submitted in accordance with Sec. 96.30.
    (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the 
Administrator will deduct NO<INF>X</INF> allowances for each such unit 
until the number of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances deducted equals the unit's 
identified percentage (under paragraph (e)(1) of this section) of the 
number of tons of NO<INF>X</INF> emissions, as determined in accordance 
with subpart H of this part, from the common stack for the control 
period for which compliance is being determined or, if no percentage is 
identified, an equal percentage for each such unit, plus the number of 
allowances required for deduction to account for actual utilization 
under Sec. 96.42(e) for the control period.
    (f) The Administrator will record in the appropriate compliance 
account or overdraft account all deductions from such an account 
pursuant to paragraphs (b), (d), or (e) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 96.55  Banking.

    (a) NO<INF>X</INF> allowances may be banked for future use or 
transfer in a compliance account, an overdraft account, or a general 
account, as follows:
    (1) Any NO<INF>X</INF> allowance that is held in a compliance 
account, an overdraft account, or a general account will remain in such 
account unless and until the NO<INF>X</INF> allowance is deducted or 
transferred under Sec. 96.31, Sec. 96.54, Sec. 96.56, subpart G of 
this part, or subpart I of this part.
    (2) The Administrator will designate, as a ``banked'' NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowance, any NO<INF>X</INF> allowance that remains in a compliance 
account, an overdraft account, or a general account after the 
Administrator has made all deductions for a given control period from 
the compliance account or overdraft account pursuant to Sec. 96.54.
    (b) Each year starting in 2004, after the Administrator has 
completed the designation of banked NO<INF>X</INF> allowances under 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section and before May 1 of the year, the 
Administrator will determine the extent to which banked NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances may

[[Page 33]]

be used for compliance in the control period for the current year, as 
follows:
    (1) The Administrator will determine the total number of banked 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances held in compliance accounts, overdraft 
accounts, or general accounts.
    (2) If the total number of banked NO<INF>X</INF> allowances 
determined, under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, to be held in 
compliance accounts, overdraft accounts, or general accounts is less 
than or equal to 10% of the sum of the State trading program budgets for 
the control period for the States in which NO<INF>X</INF> Budget units 
are located, any banked NO<INF>X</INF> allowance may be deducted for 
compliance in accordance with Sec. 96.54.
    (3) If the total number of banked NO<INF>X</INF> allowances 
determined, under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, to be held in 
compliance accounts, overdraft accounts, or general accounts exceeds 10% 
of the sum of the State trading program budgets for the control period 
for the States in which NO<INF>X</INF> Budget units are located, any 
banked allowance may be deducted for compliance in accordance with Sec. 
96.54, except as follows:
    (i) The Administrator will determine the following ratio: 0.10 
multiplied by the sum of the State trading program budgets for the 
control period for the States in which NO<INF>X</INF> Budget units are 
located and divided by the total number of banked NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances determined, under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, to be 
held in compliance accounts, overdraft accounts, or general accounts.
    (ii) The Administrator will multiply the number of banked 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances in each compliance account or overdraft 
account. The resulting product is the number of banked NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances in the account that may be deducted for compliance in 
accordance with Sec. 96.54. Any banked NO<INF>X</INF> allowances in 
excess of the resulting product may be deducted for compliance in 
accordance with Sec. 96.54, except that, if such NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances are used to make a deduction, two such NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances must be deducted for each deduction of one NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowance required under Sec. 96.54.
    (c) Any NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit may reduce its NO<INF>X</INF> 
emission rate in the 2001 or 2002 control period, the owner or operator 
of the unit may request early reduction credits, and the permitting 
authority may allocate NO<INF>X</INF> allowances in 2003 to the unit in 
accordance with the following requirements.
    (1) Each NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit for which the owner or operator 
requests any early reduction credits under paragraph (c)(4) of this 
section shall monitor NO<INF>X</INF> emissions in accordance with 
subpart H of this part starting in the 2000 control period and for each 
control period for which such early reduction credits are requested. The 
unit's monitoring system availability shall be not less than 90 percent 
during the 2000 control period, and the unit must be in compliance with 
any applicable State or Federal emissions or emissions-related 
requirements.
    (2) NO<INF>X</INF> emission rate and heat input under paragraphs 
(c)(3) through (5) of this section shall be determined in accordance 
with subpart H of this part.
    (3) Each NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit for which the owner or operator 
requests any early reduction credits under paragraph (c)(4) of this 
section shall reduce its NO<INF>X</INF> emission rate, for each control 
period for which early reduction credits are requested, to less than 
both 0.25 lb/mmBtu and 80 percent of the unit's NO<INF>X</INF> emission 
rate in the 2000 control period.
    (4) The NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account representative of a 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit that meets the requirements of paragraphs 
(c)(1)and (3) of this section may submit to the permitting authority a 
request for early reduction credits for the unit based on NO<INF>X</INF> 
emission rate reductions made by the unit in the control period for 2001 
or 2002 in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
    (i) In the early reduction credit request, the NO<INF>X</INF> 
authorized account may request early reduction credits for such control 
period in an amount equal to the unit's heat input for such control 
period multiplied by the difference between 0.25 lb/mmBtu and the unit's 
NO<INF>X</INF> emission rate for such control period, divided by 2000 
lb/ton, and rounded to the nearest ton.
    (ii) The early reduction credit request must be submitted, in a 
format specified by the permitting authority, by October 31 of the year 
in which the NO<INF>X</INF> emission rate reductions on which

[[Page 34]]

the request is based are made or such later date approved by the 
permitting authority.
    (5) The permitting authority will allocate NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances, to NO<INF>X</INF> Budget units meeting the requirements of 
paragraphs (c)(1) and (3) of this section and covered by early reduction 
requests meeting the requirements of paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this 
section, in accordance with the following procedures:
    (i) Upon receipt of each early reduction credit request, the 
permitting authority will accept the request only if the requirements of 
paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(3), and (c)(4)(ii) of this section are met and, 
if the request is accepted, will make any necessary adjustments to the 
request to ensure that the amount of the early reduction credits 
requested meets the requirement of paragraphs (c)(2) and (4) of this 
section.
    (ii) If the State's compliance supplement pool has an amount of 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances not less than the number of early reduction 
credits in all accepted early reduction credit requests for 2001 and 
2002 (as adjusted under paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section), the 
permitting authority will allocate to each NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit 
covered by such accepted requests one allowance for each early reduction 
credit requested (as adjusted under paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this 
section).
    (iii) If the State's compliance supplement pool has a smaller amount 
of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances than the number of early reduction credits 
in all accepted early reduction credit requests for 2001 and 2002 (as 
adjusted under paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section), the permitting 
authority will allocate NO<INF>X</INF> allowances to each NO<INF>X</INF> 
Budget unit covered by such accepted requests according to the following 
formula:

Unit's allocated early reduction credits = [(Unit's adjusted early 
    reduction credits) / (Total adjusted early reduction credits 
    requested by all units)]x(Available NO<INF>X</INF> allowances from 
    the State's compliance supplement pool)

where:

``Unit's adjusted early reduction credits'' is the number of early 
reduction credits for the unit for 2001 and 2002 in accepted early 
reduction credit requests, as adjusted under paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this 
section.
``Total adjusted early reduction credits requested by all units'' is the 
number of early reduction credits for all units for 2001 and 2002 in 
accepted early reduction credit requests, as adjusted under paragraph 
(c)(5)(i) of this section.
``Available NO<INF>X</INF> allowances from the State's compliance 
supplement pool'' is the number of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances in the 
State's compliance supplement pool and available for early reduction 
credits for 2001 and 2002.

    (6) By May 1, 2003, the permitting authority will submit to the 
Administrator the allocations of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances determined 
under paragraph (c)(5) of this section. The Administrator will record 
such allocations to the extent that they are consistent with the 
requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) through (5) of this section.
    (7) NO<INF>X</INF> allowances recorded under paragraph (c)(6) of 
this section may be deducted for compliance under Sec. 96.54 for the 
control periods in 2003 or 2004. Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this 
section, the Administrator will deduct as retired any NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowance that is recorded under paragraph (c)(6) of this section and is 
not deducted for compliance in accordance with Sec. 96.54 for the 
control period in 2003 or 2004.
    (8) NO<INF>X</INF> allowances recorded under paragraph (c)(6) of 
this section are treated as banked allowances in 2004 for the purposes 
of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 96.56  Account error.

    The Administrator may, at his or her sole discretion and on his or 
her own motion, correct any error in any NO<INF>X</INF> Allowance 
Tracking System account. Within 10 business days of making such 
correction, the Administrator will notify the NO<INF>X</INF> authorized 
account representative for the account.


<R05>
Sec. 96.57  Closing of general accounts.

    (a) The NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account representative of a 
general account may instruct the Administrator to close the account by 
submitting a statement requesting deletion of the account from the 
NO<INF>X</INF> Allowance Tracking System and by correctly submitting for 
recordation under Sec. 96.60 an allowance transfer of all 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances in the

[[Page 35]]

account to one or more other NO<INF>X</INF> Allowance Tracking System 
accounts.
    (b) If a general account shows no activity for a period of a year or 
more and does not contain any NO<INF>X</INF> allowances, the 
Administrator may notify the NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account 
representative for the account that the account will be closed and 
deleted from the NO<INF>X</INF> Allowance Tracking System following 20 
business days after the notice is sent. The account will be closed after 
the 20-day period unless before the end of the 20-day period the 
Administrator receives a correctly submitted transfer of NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances into the account under Sec. 96.60 or a statement submitted 
by the NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account representative demonstrating to 
the satisfaction of the Administrator good cause as to why the account 
should not be closed.

    (2) Requirements for recertification. Whenever the owner or operator 
makes a replacement, modification, or change in a certified monitoring 
system that the Administrator or the permitting authority determines 
significantly affects the ability of the system to accurately measure or 
record NO<INF>X</INF> mass emissions or heat input or to meet the 
requirements of Sec. 75.21 of this chapter or appendix B to part 75 of 
this chapter, the owner or operator shall recertify the monitoring 
system according to Sec. 75.20(b) of this chapter. Furthermore, 
whenever the owner or operator makes a replacement, modification, or 
change to the flue gas handling system or the unit's operation that the 
Administrator or the permitting authority determines to significantly 
change the flow or concentration profile, the owner or operator shall 
recertify the continuous emissions monitoring system according to Sec. 
75.20(b) of this chapter. Examples of changes which require 
recertification include: replacement of the analyzer, change in location 
or orientation of the sampling probe or site, or changing of flow rate 
monitor polynomial coefficients.
    (3) Certification approval process for initial certifications and 
recertification. (i) Notification of certification. The NO<INF>X</INF> 
authorized account representative shall submit to the permitting 
authority, the appropriate EPA Regional Office and the permitting 
authority a written notice of the dates of certification in accordance 
with Sec. 96.73.
    (ii) Certification application. The NO<INF>X</INF> authorized 
account representative shall submit to the permitting authority a 
certification application for each monitoring system required under 
subpart H of part 75 of this chapter. A complete certification 
application shall include the information specified in subpart H of part 
75 of this chapter.
    (iii) Except for units using the low mass emission excepted 
methodology under Sec. 75.19 of this chapter, the provisional 
certification date for a monitor shall be determined using the 
procedures set forth in Sec. 75.20(a)(3) of this chapter. A 
provisionally certified monitor may be used under the NO<INF>X</INF> 
Budget Trading Program for a period not to exceed 120 days after receipt 
by the permitting authority of the complete certification application 
for the monitoring system or component thereof under paragraph 
(b)(3)(ii) of this section. Data measured and recorded by the 
provisionally certified monitoring system or component thereof, in 
accordance with the requirements of part 75 of this chapter, will be 
considered valid quality-assured data (retroactive to the date and time 
of provisional certification), provided that the permitting authority 
does not invalidate the provisional certification by issuing a notice of 
disapproval within 120 days of receipt of the complete certification 
application by the permitting authority.

[[Page 39]]

    (iv) Certification application formal approval process. The 
permitting authority will issue a written notice of approval or 
disapproval of the certification application to the owner or operator 
within 120 days of receipt of the complete certification application 
under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section. In the event the permitting 
authority does not issue such a notice within such 120-day period, each 
monitoring system which meets the applicable performance requirements of 
part 75 of this chapter and is included in the certification application 
will be deemed certified for use under the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget Trading 
Program.
    (A) Approval notice. If the certification application is complete 
and shows that each monitoring system meets the applicable performance 
requirements of part 75 of this chapter, then the permitting authority 
will issue a written notice of approval of the certification application

    (B) Incomplete application notice. A certification application will 
be considered complete when all of the applicable information required 
to be submitted under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section has been 
received by the permitting authority. If the certification application 
is not complete, then the permitting authority will issue a written 
notice of incompleteness that sets a reasonable date by which the 
NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account representative must submit the 
additional information required to complete the certification 
application. If the NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account representative 
does not comply with the notice of incompleteness by the specified date, 
then the permitting authority may issue a notice of disapproval under 
paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(C) of this section.
    (C) Disapproval notice. If the certification application shows that 
any monitoring system or component thereof does not meet the performance 
requirements of this part, or if the certification application is 
incomplete and the requirement for disapproval under paragraph 
(b)(3)(iv)(B) of this section has been met, the permitting authority 
will issue a written notice of disapproval of the certification 
application. Upon issuance of such notice of disapproval, the 
provisional certification is invalidated by the permitting authority and 
the data measured and recorded by each uncertified monitoring system or 
component thereof shall not be considered valid quality-assured data 
beginning with the date and hour of provisional certification. The owner 
or operator shall follow the procedures for loss of certification in 
paragraph (b)(3)(v) of this section for each monitoring system or 
component thereof which is disapproved for initial certification.
    (D) Audit decertification. The permitting authority may issue a 
notice of disapproval of the certification status of a monitor in 
accordance with Sec. 96.72(b).

rate shall be calculated as the unit's total heat input (in mmBtu) for 
the control period and the unit's baseline NO<INF>X</INF> emissions rate 
shall be calculated as the unit's total NO<INF>X</INF> emissions (in lb) 
for the control period divided by the unit's baseline heat rate.
    (d) After calculating the baseline heat input and the baseline 
NO<INF>X</INF> emissions rate for the unit under paragraph (c) of this 
section, the permitting authority will serve a draft NO<INF>X</INF> 
Budget opt-in permit on the NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account 
representative of the unit.
    (e) Confirmation of intention to opt-in. Within 20 days after the 
issuance of the draft NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in permit, the 
NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account representative of the unit must submit 
to the permitting authority a confirmation of the intention to opt in 
the unit or a withdrawal of the application for a NO<INF>X</INF> Budget 
opt-in permit under Sec. 96.83. The permitting authority will treat the 
failure to make a timely submission as a withdrawal of the 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in permit application.
    (f) Issuance of draft NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in permit. If the 
NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account representative confirms the intention 
to opt-in the unit under paragraph (e) of this section, the permitting 
authority will issue the draft NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in permit in 
accordance with Sec. 96.20.
    (g) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section, if 
at any time before issuance of a draft NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in 
permit for the unit, the permitting authority determines that the unit 
does not qualify as a NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in source under Sec. 
96.80, the permitting authority will issue a draft denial of a 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in permit for the unit in accordance with 
Sec. 96.20.
    (h) Withdrawal of application for NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in 
permit. A NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account representative of a unit may 
withdraw its application for a NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in permit under 
Sec. 96.83 at any time prior to the issuance of the final 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in permit. Once the application for a 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in permit is withdrawn, a NO<INF>X</INF> 
authorized account representative wanting to reapply must submit a new 
application for a NO<INF>X</INF> Budget permit under Sec. 96.83.
    (i) Effective date. The effective date of the initial NO<INF>X</INF> 
Budget opt-in permit shall be May 1 of the first control period starting 
after the issuance of the initial NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in permit by 
the permitting authority. The unit shall be a NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-
in source and a NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit as of the effective date of 
the initial NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in permit.


<R05>
Sec. 96.85  NOX Budget opt-in permit contents.

    (a) Each NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in permit (including any draft or 
proposed NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in permit, if applicable) will 
contain all elements required for a complete NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-
in permit application under Sec. 96.22 as approved or adjusted by the 
permitting authority.
    (b) Each NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in permit is deemed to 
incorporate automatically the definitions of terms under Sec. 96.2 and, 
upon recordation by the Administrator under subpart F, G, or I of this 
part, every allocation, transfer, or deduction of NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances to or from the compliance accounts of each NO<INF>X</INF> 
Budget opt-in source covered by the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in permit 
or the overdraft account of the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget source where the 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in source is located.


<R05>
Sec. 96.86  Withdrawal from NOX Budget Trading Program.

    (a) Requesting withdrawal. To withdraw from the NO<INF>X</INF> 
Budget Trading Program, the NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account 
representative of a NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in source shall submit to 
the permitting authority a request to withdraw effective as of a 
specified date prior to May 1 or after September 30. The submission 
shall be made no later than 90 days prior to the requested effective 
date of withdrawal.
    (b) Conditions for withdrawal. Before a NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in 
source covered by a request under paragraph (a) of this section may 
withdraw from the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget Trading Program and the 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in permit may be terminated under paragraph 
(e) of this section, the following conditions must be met:
    (1) For the control period immediately before the withdrawal is to 
be effective, the NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account representative must 
submit or must have submitted to the permitting authority an annual 
compliance certification report in accordance with Sec. 96.30.

[[Page 46]]

    (2) If the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in source has excess emissions 
for the control period immediately before the withdrawal is to be 
effective, the Administrator will deduct or has deducted from the 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in source's compliance account, or the 
overdraft account of the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget source where the 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in source is located, the full amount required 
under Sec. 96.54(d) for the control period.
    (3) After the requirements for withdrawal under paragraphs (b)(1) 
and (2) of this section are met, the Administrator will deduct from the 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in source's compliance account, or the 
overdraft account of the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget source where the 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in source is located, NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances equal in number to and allocated for the same or a prior 
control period as any NO<INF>X</INF> allowances allocated to that source 
under Sec. 96.88 for any control period for which the withdrawal is to 
be effective. The Administrator will close the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget 
opt-in source's compliance account and will establish, and transfer any 
remaining allowances to, a new general account for the owners and 
operators of the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in source. The NO<INF>X</INF> 
authorized account representative for the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in 
source shall become the NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account representative 
for the general account.
    (c) A NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in source that withdraws from the 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget Trading Program shall comply with all requirements 
under the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget Trading Program concerning all years for 
which such NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in source was a NO<INF>X</INF> 
Budget opt-in source, even if such requirements arise or must be 
complied with after the withdrawal takes effect.
    (d) Notification. (1) After the requirements for withdrawal under 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section are met (including deduction of 
the full amount of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances required), the permitting 
authority will issue a notification to the NO<INF>X</INF> authorized 
account representative of the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in source of the 
acceptance of the withdrawal of the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in source 
as of a specified effective date that is after such requirements have 
been met and that is prior to May 1 or after September 30.
    (2) If the requirements for withdrawal under paragraphs (a) and (b) 
of this section are not met, the permitting authority will issue a 
notification to the NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account representative of 
the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in source that the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget 
opt-in source's request to withdraw is denied. If the NO<INF>X</INF> 
Budget opt-in source's request to withdraw is denied, the NO<INF>X</INF> 
Budget opt-in source shall remain subject to the requirements for a 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in source.
    (e) Permit amendment. After the permitting authority issues a 
notification under paragraph (d)(1) of this section that the 
requirements for withdrawal have been met, the permitting authority will 
revise the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget permit covering the NO<INF>X</INF> 
Budget opt-in source to terminate the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in 
permit as of the effective date specified under paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section. A NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in source shall continue to be a 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in source until the effective date of the 
termination.
    (f) Reapplication upon failure to meet conditions of withdrawal. If 
the permitting authority denies the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in 
source's request to withdraw, the NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account 
representative may submit another request to withdraw in accordance with 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
    (g) Ability to return to the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget Trading Program. 
Once a NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in source withdraws from the 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget Trading Program and its NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-
in permit is terminated under this section, the NO<INF>X</INF> authority 
account representative may not submit another application for a 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in permit under Sec. 96.83 for the unit prior 
to the date that is 4 years after the date on which the terminated 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in permit became effective.


<R05>
Sec. 96.87  Change in regulatory status.

    (a) Notification. When a NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in source becomes 
a NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit under Sec. 96.4, the NO<INF>X</INF> 
authorized account representative shall notify in writing the permitting 
authority and the Administrator of such change in the NO<INF>X</INF> 
Budget opt-in source's regulatory status, within 30 days of such change.

[[Page 47]]

    (b) Permitting authority's and Administrator's action. (1)(i) When 
the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in source becomes a NO<INF>X</INF> Budget 
unit under Sec. 96.4, the permitting authority will revise the 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in source's NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in 
permit to meet the requirements of a NO<INF>X</INF> Budget permit under 
Sec. 96.23 as of an effective date that is the date on which such 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in source becomes a NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit 
under Sec. 96.4.
    (ii)(A) The Administrator will deduct from the compliance account 
for the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this 
section, or the overdraft account of the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget source 
where the unit is located, NO<INF>X</INF> allowances equal in number to 
and allocated for the same or a prior control period as:
    (1) Any NO<INF>X</INF> allowances allocated to the NO<INF>X</INF> 
Budget unit (as a NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in source) under Sec. 96.88 
for any control period after the last control period during which the 
unit's NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in permit was effective; and
    (2) If the effective date of the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget permit 
revision under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section is during a control 
period, the NO<INF>X</INF> allowances allocated to the NO<INF>X</INF> 
Budget unit (as a NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in source) under Sec. 96.88 
for the control period multiplied by the ratio of the number of days, in 
the control period, starting with the effective date of the permit 
revision under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, divided by the total 
number of days in the control period.
    (B) The NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account representative shall 
ensure that the compliance account of the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit 
under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, or the overdraft account of 
the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget source where the unit is located, includes the 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances necessary for completion of the deduction 
under paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section. If the compliance account 
or overdraft account does not contain sufficient NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances, the Administrator will deduct the required number of 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances, regardless of the control period for which 
they were allocated, whenever NO<INF>X</INF> allowances are recorded in 
either account.
    (iii)(A) For every control period during which the NO<INF>X</INF> 
Budget permit revised under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section is 
effective, the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of 
this section will be treated, solely for purposes of NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowance allocations under Sec. 96.42, as a unit that commenced 
operation on the effective date of the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget permit 
revision under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section and will be allocated 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances under Sec. 96.42.
    (B) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(A) of this section, if the 
effective date of the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget permit revision under 
paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section is during a control period, the 
following number of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances will be allocated to the 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section 
under Sec. 96.42 for the control period: the number of NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances otherwise allocated to the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit under 
Sec. 96.42 for the control period multiplied by the ratio of the number 
of days, in the control period, starting with the effective date of the 
permit revision under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, divided by 
the total number of days in the control period.
    (2)(i) When the NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account representative of 
a NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in source does not renew its NO<INF>X</INF> 
Budget opt-in permit under Sec. 96.83(b), the Administrator will deduct 
from the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in unit's compliance account, or the 
overdraft account of the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget source where the 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in source is located, NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances equal in number to and allocated for the same or a prior 
control period as any NO<INF>X</INF> allowances allocated to the 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in source under Sec. 96.88 for any control 
period after the last control period for which the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget 
opt-in permit is effective. The NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account 
representative shall ensure that the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in 
source's compliance account or the overdraft account of the 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget source where the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in 
source is located includes the NO<INF>X</INF> allowances necessary for 
completion of such deduction. If the compliance account or overdraft 
account does not contain sufficient NO<INF>X</INF> allowances, the 
Administrator will deduct the required number of NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances, regardless of the control period for which they were 
allocated, whenever NO<INF>X</INF> allowances are recorded in either 
account.

[[Page 48]]

    (ii) After the deduction under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section 
is completed, the Administrator will close the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget 
opt-in source's compliance account. If any NO<INF>X</INF> allowances 
remain in the compliance account after completion of such deduction and 
any deduction under Sec. 96.54, the Administrator will close the 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in source's compliance account and will 
establish, and transfer any remaining allowances to, a new general 
account for the owners and operators of the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in 
source. The NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account representative for the 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in source shall become the NO<INF>X</INF> 
authorized account representative for the general account.


<R05>
Sec. 96.88  NOX allowance allocations to opt-in units.

    (a) NO<INF>X</INF> allowance allocation. (1) By December 31 
immediately before the first control period for which the NO<INF>X</INF> 
Budget opt-in permit is effective, the permitting authority will 
allocate NO<INF>X</INF> allowances to the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in 
source and submit to the Administrator the allocation for the control

31 of each year thereafter, the permitting authority will allocate 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances to the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in source, 
and submit to the Administrator allocations for the next control period, 
in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) For each control period for which the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-
in source has an approved NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in permit, the 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in source will be allocated NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances in accordance with the following procedures:
    (1) The heat input (in mmBtu) used for calculating NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowance allocations will be the lesser of:
    (i) The NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in source's baseline heat input 
determined pursuant to Sec. 96.84(c); or
    (ii) The NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in source's heat input, as 
determined in accordance with subpart H of this part, for the control 
period in the year prior to the year of the control period for which the 
NO<INF>X</INF> allocations are being calculated.
    (2) The permitting authority will allocate NO<INF>X</INF> allowances 
to the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in source in an amount equaling the 
heat input (in mmBtu) determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section 
multiplied by the lesser of:
    (i) The NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in source's baseline 
NO<INF>X</INF> emissions rate (in lb/mmBtu) determined pursuant to Sec. 
96.84(c); or

operating permit at the source shall:
    (i) Submit to the permitting authority a complete CAIR permit 
application under Sec. 96.122 in accordance with the deadlines

permitting authority determines is necessary in order to review a CAIR 
permit application and issue or deny a CAIR permit.
    (2) The owners and operators of each CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> source 
required to have a title V operating permit and each CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
unit required to have a title V operating permit at the source shall 
have a CAIR permit issued by the permitting authority under subpart CC 
of this part for the source and operate the source and the unit in 
compliance with such CAIR permit.
    (3) Except as provided in subpart II of this part, the owners and 
operators of a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> source that is not otherwise required 
to have a title V operating permit and each CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> unit 
that is not otherwise required to have a title V operating permit are 
not required to submit a CAIR permit application, and to have a CAIR 
permit, under subpart CC of this part for such CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
source and such CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> unit.
    (b) Monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements. (1) The 
owners and operators, and the CAIR designated representative, of each 
CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> source and each CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> unit at the 
source shall comply with the monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping 
requirements of subpart HH of this part.
    (2) The emissions measurements recorded and reported in accordance 
with subpart HH of this part shall be used to determine compliance by 
each CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> source with the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> emissions 
limitation under paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c) Nitrogen oxides emission requirements. (1) As of the allowance 
transfer deadline for a control period, the owners and operators of each 
CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> source and each CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> unit at the 
source shall hold, in the source's compliance account, CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances available for compliance deductions for the 
control period under Sec. 96.154(a) in an amount not less than the tons 
of total nitrogen oxides emissions for the control period from all CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> units at the source, as determined in accordance with 
subpart HH of this part.

or transferred into or among CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Allowance Tracking 
System accounts in accordance with subparts FF, GG, and II of this part.
    (5) A CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowance is a limited authorization to 
emit one ton of nitrogen oxides in accordance with the CAIR

NO<INF>X</INF> Annual Trading Program, the CAIR permit application, the 
CAIR permit, or an exemption under Sec. 96.105 and no provision of law 
shall be construed to limit the authority of the State or the United 
States to terminate or limit such authorization.
    (6) A CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowance does not constitute a property 
right.
    (7) Upon recordation by the Administrator under subpart EE, FF, GG, 
or II of this part, every allocation, transfer, or deduction of a CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowance to or from a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> source's 
compliance account is incorporated automatically in any CAIR permit of 
the source.

other remedy imposed, for the same violations, under the Clean Air Act 
or applicable State law; and
    (2) Each ton of such excess emissions and each day of such control 
period shall constitute a separate violation of this subpart, the Clean 
Air Act, and applicable State law.
    (e) Recordkeeping and reporting requirements. (1) Unless otherwise 
provided, the owners and operators of the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> source and 
each CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> unit at the source shall keep on site at the

date the document is created. This period may be extended for cause, at 
any time before the end of 5 years, in writing by the permitting

source and each CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> unit at the source shall submit the 
reports required under the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Annual Trading Program, 
including those under subpart HH of this part.

    (2) Any provision of the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Annual Trading Program 
that applies to a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> source or the CAIR designated 
representative of a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> source shall also apply to the

that applies to a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> unit or the CAIR designated 
representative of a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> unit shall also apply to the

unit from compliance with any other provision of the applicable, 
approved State implementation plan, a federally enforceable permit, or

Sec. 96.141  Timing requirements for CAIR NOX allowance allocations.

    (a) By October 31, 2006, the permitting authority will submit to the 
Administrator the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowance allocations, in a format 
prescribed by the Administrator and in accordance with Sec. 96.142(a) 
and (b), for the control periods in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 
2014.
    (b) By October 31, 2009 and October 31 of each year thereafter, the 
permitting authority will submit to the Administrator the CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowance allocations, in a format prescribed by the 
Administrator and in accordance with Sec. 96.142(a) and (b), for the 
control period in the sixth year after the year of the applicable 
deadline for submission under this paragraph.
    (c) By October 31, 2009 and October 31 of each year thereafter, the 
permitting authority will submit to the Administrator the CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowance allocations, in a format prescribed by the 
Administrator and in accordance with Sec. 96.142(a), (c), and (d), for 
the control period in the year of the applicable deadline for submission 
under this paragraph.

[70 FR 25339, May 12, 2005, as amended at 71 FR 25383, Apr. 28, 2006]


<R05>
Sec. 96.142  CAIR NOX allowance allocations.

    (a)(1) The baseline heat input (in mmBtu) used with respect to CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowance allocations under paragraph (b) of this section 
for each CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> unit will be:
    (i) For units commencing operation before January 1, 2001 the 
average of the 3 highest amounts of the unit's adjusted control period 
heat input for 2000 through 2004, with the adjusted control period heat 
input for each year calculated as follows:
    (A) If the unit is coal-fired during the year, the unit's control 
period heat input for such year is multiplied by 100 percent;
    (B) If the unit is oil-fired during the year, the unit's control 
period heat input for such year is multiplied by 60 percent; and
    (C) If the unit is not subject to paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) or (B) of 
this section, the unit's control period heat input for such year is 
multiplied by 40 percent.

[[Page 67]]

    (ii) For units commencing operation on or after January 1, 2001 and 
operating each calendar year during a period of 5 or more consecutive 
calendar years, the average of the 3 highest amounts of the unit's total 
converted control period heat input over the first such 5 years.
    (2)(i) A unit's control period heat input, and a unit's status as 
coal-fired or oil-fired, for a calendar year under paragraph (a)(1)(i) 
of this section, and a unit's total tons of NO<INF>X</INF> emissions 
during a calendar year under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, will be 
determined in accordance with part 75 of this chapter, to the extent the 
unit was otherwise subject to the requirements of part 75 of this 
chapter for the year, or will be based on the best available data 
reported to the permitting authority for the unit, to the extent the 
unit was not otherwise subject to the requirements of part 75 of this 
chapter for the year.
    (ii) A unit's converted control period heat input for a calendar 
year specified under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section equals:
    (A) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(B) or (C) of this 
section, the control period gross electrical output of the generator or 
generators served by the unit multiplied by 7,900 Btu/kWh, if the unit 
is coal-fired for the year, or 6,675 Btu/kWh, if the unit is not coal-
fired for the year, and divided by 1,000,000 Btu/mmBtu, provided that if 
a generator is served by 2 or more units, then the gross electrical 
output of the generator will be attributed to each unit in proportion to 
the unit's share of the total control period heat input of such units 
for the year;
    (B) For a unit that is a boiler and has equipment used to produce 
electricity and useful thermal energy for industrial, commercial, 
heating, or cooling purposes through the sequential use of energy, the 
total heat energy (in Btu) of the steam produced by the boiler during 
the control period, divided by 0.8 and by 1,000,000 Btu/mmBtu; or
    (C) For a unit that is a combustion turbine and has equipment used 
to produce electricity and useful thermal energy for industrial, 
commercial, heating, or cooling purposes through the sequential use of 
energy, the control period gross electrical output of the enclosed 
device comprising the compressor, combustor, and turbine multiplied by 
3,413 Btu/kWh, plus the total heat energy (in Btu) of the steam produced 
by any associated heat recovery steam generator during the control 
period divided by 0.8, and with the sum divided by 1,000,000 Btu/mmBtu.
    (b)(1) For each control period in 2009 and thereafter, the 
permitting authority will allocate to all CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> units in 
the State that have a baseline heat input (as determined under paragraph 
(a) of this section) a total amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances 
equal to 95 percent for a control period during 2009 through 2014, and 
97 percent for a control period during 2015 and thereafter, of the tons 
of NO<INF>X</INF> emissions in the State trading budget under Sec. 
96.140 (except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section).
    (2) The permitting authority will allocate CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances to each CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> unit under paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section in an amount determined by multiplying the total amount of 
CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances allocated under paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section by the ratio of the baseline heat input of such CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> unit to the total amount of baseline heat input of all 
such CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> units in the State and rounding to the nearest 
whole allowance as appropriate.
    (c) For each control period in 2009 and thereafter, the permitting 
authority will allocate CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances to CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> units in a State that are not allocated CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances under paragraph (b) of this section because 
the units do not yet have a baseline heat input under paragraph (a) of 
this section or because the units have a baseline heat input but all 
CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances available under paragraph (b) of this 
section for the control period are already allocated, in accordance with 
the following procedures:
    (1) The permitting authority will establish a separate new unit set-
aside for each control period. Each new unit set-aside will be allocated 
CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances equal to 5 percent for a control period 
in 2009 through 2014, and 3 percent for a control period in 2015and 
thereafter, of the amount of tons of

[[Page 68]]

NO<INF>X</INF> emissions in the State trading budget under Sec. 96.140.
    (2) The CAIR designated representative of such a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
unit may submit to the permitting authority a request, in a format 
specified by the permitting authority, to be allocated CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances, starting with the later of the control period 
in 2009 or the first control period after the control period in which 
the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> unit commences commercial operation and until 
the first control period for which the unit is allocated CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances under paragraph (b) of this section. A 
separate CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowance allocation request for each 
control period for which CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances are sought must 
be submitted on or before May 1 of such control period and after the 
date on which the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> unit commences commercial 
operation.
    (3) In a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowance allocation request under 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the CAIR designated representative may 
request for a control period CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances in an amount 
not exceeding the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> unit's total tons of 
NO<INF>X</INF> emissions during the calendar year immediately before 
such control period.
    (4) The permitting authority will review each CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowance allocation request under paragraph (c)(2) of this section and 
will allocate CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances for each control period 
pursuant to such request as follows:
    (i) The permitting authority will accept an allowance allocation 
request only if the request meets, or is adjusted by the permitting 
authority as necessary to meet, the requirements of paragraphs (c)(2) 
and (3) of this section.
    (ii) On or after May 1 of the control period, the permitting 
authority will determine the sum of the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances 
requested (as adjusted under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section) in all 
allowance allocation requests accepted under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this 
section for the control period.
    (iii) If the amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances in the new 
unit set-aside for the control period is greater than or equal to the 
sum under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, then the permitting 
authority will allocate the amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances 
requested (as adjusted under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section) to 
each CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> unit covered by an allowance allocation request 
accepted under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section.
    (iv) If the amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances in the new unit 
set-aside for the control period is less than the sum under paragraph 
(c)(4)(ii) of this section, then the permitting authority will allocate 
to each CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> unit covered by an allowance allocation 
request accepted under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section the amount of 
the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances requested (as adjusted under 
paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section), multiplied by the amount of CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances in the new unit set-aside for the control 
period, divided by the sum determined under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this 
section, and rounded to the nearest whole allowance as appropriate.
    (v) The permitting authority will notify each CAIR designated 
representative that submitted an allowance allocation request of the 
amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances (if any) allocated for the 
control period to the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> unit covered by the request.
    (d) If, after completion of the procedures under paragraph (c)(4) of 
this section for a control period, any unallocated CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances remain in the new unit set-aside for the control period, the 
permitting authority will allocate to each CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> unit that 
was allocated CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances under paragraph (b) of this 
section an amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances equal to the total 
amount of such remaining unallocated CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances, 
multiplied by the unit's allocation under paragraph (b) of this section, 
divided by 95 percent for a control period during 2009 through 2014, and 
97 percent for a control period during 2015 and thereafter, of the 
amount of tons of NO<INF>X</INF> emissions in the State trading budget 
under Sec. 96.140, and rounded to the nearest whole allowance as 
appropriate.

    (b) For any CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> unit in the State that achieves 
NO<INF>X</INF> emission reductions in 2007 and 2008 that are not 
necessary to comply with any State or federal emissions limitation 
applicable during such years, the CAIR designated representative of the 
unit may request early reduction credits, and allocation of CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances from the compliance supplement pool under 
paragraph (a) of this section for such early reduction credits, in 
accordance with the following:
    (1) The owners and operators of such CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> unit shall 
monitor and report the NO<INF>X</INF> emissions rate and the heat input 
of the unit in accordance with subpart HH of this part in each control 
period for which early reduction credit is requested.
    (2) The CAIR designated representative of such CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
unit shall submit to the permitting authority by May 1, 2009 a request, 
in a format specified by the permitting authority, for allocation of an 
amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances from the compliance supplement 
pool not exceeding the sum of the amounts (in tons) of the unit's 
NO<INF>X</INF> emission reductions in 2007 and 2008 that are not 
necessary to comply with any State or federal emissions limitation 
applicable during such years, determined in accordance with subpart HH 
of this part.
    (c) For any CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> unit in the State whose compliance 
with the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> emissions limitation for the control period 
in 2009 would create an undue risk to the reliability of electricity 
supply during such control period, the CAIR designated representative of 
the unit may request the allocation of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances 
from the compliance supplement pool under paragraph (a) of this section, 
in accordance with the following:
    (1) The CAIR designated representative of such CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
unit shall submit to the permitting authority by May 1, 2009 a request, 
in a format specified by the permitting authority, for allocation of an 
amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances from the compliance supplement 
pool not exceeding the minimum amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances 
necessary to remove such undue risk to the reliability of electricity 
supply.
    (2) In the request under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the CAIR 
designated representative of such CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> unit shall 
demonstrate that, in the absence of allocation to the unit of the amount 
of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances requested, the unit's compliance with 
the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> emissions limitation for the control period in 
2009 would create an undue risk to the reliability of electricity supply 
during such control period. This demonstration must include a showing 
that it would not be feasible for the owners and operators of the unit 
to:
    (i) Obtain a sufficient amount of electricity from other electricity 
generation facilities, during the installation of control technology at 
the unit for compliance with the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> emissions 
limitation, to prevent such undue risk; or
    (ii) Obtain under paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section, or 
otherwise obtain, a sufficient amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances 
to prevent such undue risk.
    (d) The permitting authority will review each request under 
paragraph (b) or (c) of this section submitted by May 1, 2009 and will 
allocate CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances for the control period in 2009

[[Page 70]]

to CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> units in the State and covered by such request as 
follows:
    (1) Upon receipt of each such request, the permitting authority will 
make any necessary adjustments to the request to ensure that the amount 
of the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances requested meets the requirements 
of paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.
    (2) If the State's compliance supplement pool under paragraph (a) of 
this section has an amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances not less 
than the total amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances in all such 
requests (as adjusted under paragraph (d)(1) of this section), the 
permitting authority will allocate to each CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> unit 
covered by such requests the amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances 
requested (as adjusted under paragraph (d)(1) of this section).
    (3) If the State's compliance supplement pool under paragraph (a) of 
this section has a smaller amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances than 
the total amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances in all such requests 
(as adjusted under paragraph (d)(1) of this section), the permitting 
authority will allocate CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances to each CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> unit covered by such requests according to the following 
formula and rounding to the nearest whole allowance as appropriate:

Unit's allocation = Unit's adjusted allocation x (State's compliance 
    supplement pool / Total adjusted allocations for all units)

Where:

    `Unit's allocation' is the amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances 
allocated to the unit from the State's compliance supplement pool. 
Unit's adjusted allocation'' is the amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances requested for the unit under paragraph (b) or (c) of this 
section, as adjusted under paragraph (d)(1) of this section. ``State's 
compliance supplement pool'' is the amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances in the State's compliance supplement pool. ``Total adjusted 
allocations for all units'' is the sum of the amounts of allocations 
requested for all units under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, as 
adjusted under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

    (4) By November 30, 2009, the permitting authority will determine, 
and submit to the Administrator, the allocations under paragraph (d)(2) 
or (3)of this section.
    (5) By January 1, 2010, the Administrator will record the 
allocations under paragraph (d)(4) of this section.

[70 FR 25339, May 12, 2005, as amended at 71 FR 25384, Apr. 28, 2006]

    Editorial Note: At 71 FR 25384, Apr. 28, 2006, Sec. 196.153 was 
amended; however, the amendment could not be incorporated due to 
inaccurate amendatory instruction.


<R05>
Sec. 96.154  Compliance with CAIR NOX emissions limitation.

    (a) Allowance transfer deadline. The CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances 
are available to be deducted for compliance with a source's CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> emissions limitation for a control period in a given 
calendar year only if the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances:
    (1) Were allocated for the control period in the year or a prior 
year; and
    (2) Are held in the compliance account as of the allowance transfer 
deadline for the control period or are transferred into the compliance 
account by a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowance transfer correctly submitted 
for recordation under Sec. Sec. 96.160 and 96.161 by the allowance 
transfer deadline for the control period.
    (b) Deductions for compliance. Following the recordation, in 
accordance with Sec. 96.161, of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowance transfers 
submitted for recordation in a source's compliance account by the 
allowance transfer deadline for a control period, the Administrator will 
deduct from the compliance account CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances 
available under paragraph (a) of this section in order to determine 
whether the source meets the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> emissions limitation 
for the control period, as follows:
    (1) Until the amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances deducted 
equals the number of tons of total nitrogen oxides emissions, determined 
in accordance with subpart HH of this part, from all CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
units at the source for the control period; or
    (2) If there are insufficient CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances to 
complete the deductions in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, until no 
more CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances available under paragraph (a) of 
this section remain in the compliance account.
    (c)(1) Identification of CAIR NOX allowances by serial number. The 
CAIR authorized account representative for a source's compliance account 
may request that specific CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances, identified by 
serial number, in the compliance account be deducted for emissions or 
excess emissions for a control period in accordance with paragraph (b) 
or (d) of

[[Page 75]]

this section. Such request shall be submitted to the Administrator by 
the allowance transfer deadline for the control period and include, in a 
format prescribed by the Administrator, the identification of the CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> source and the appropriate serial numbers.
    (2) First-in, first-out. The Administrator will deduct CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances under paragraph (b) or (d) of this section 
from the source's compliance account, in the absence of an 
identification or in the case of a partial identification of CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances by serial number under paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section, on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) accounting basis in the 
following order:
    (i) Any CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances that were allocated to the 
units at the source, in the order of recordation; and then
    (ii) Any CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances that were allocated to any 
entity and transferred and recorded in the compliance account pursuant 
to subpart GG of this part, in the order of recordation.
    (d) Deductions for excess emissions. (1) After making the deductions 
for compliance under paragraph (b) of this section for a control period 
in a calendar year in which the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> source has excess 
emissions, the Administrator will deduct from the source's compliance 
account an amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances, allocated for the 
control period in the immediately following calendar year, equal to 3 
times the number of tons of the source's excess emissions.
    (2) Any allowance deduction required under paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section shall not affect the liability of the owners and operators of 
the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> source or the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> units at the 
source for any fine, penalty, or assessment, or their obligation to 
comply with any other remedy, for the same violations, as ordered under 
the Clean Air Act or applicable State law.
    (e) Recordation of deductions. The Administrator will record in the 
appropriate compliance account all deductions from such an account under 
paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section and subpart II.
    (f) Administrator's action on submissions. (1) The Administrator may 
review and conduct independent audits concerning any submission under 
the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Annual Trading Program and make appropriate 
adjustments of the information in the submissions.
    (2) The Administrator may deduct CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances from 
or transfer CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances to a source's compliance 
account based on the information in the submissions, as adjusted under 
paragraph (f)(1) of this section, and record such deductions and 
transfers.

each continuous emission monitoring system whose accuracy is potentially 
affected by the change, in accordance with Sec. 75.20(b) of this 
chapter. Examples of changes to a continuous emission monitoring system 
that require recertification include replacement of the analyzer, 
complete replacement of an existing continuous emission monitoring 
system, or change in location or orientation of the sampling probe or 
site. Any fuel flowmeter system, and any excepted NO<INF>X</INF> 
monitoring system under appendix E to part 75 of this chapter, under 
Sec. 96.170(a)(1) are subject to the recertification requirements in 
Sec. 75.20(g)(6) of this chapter.
    (3) Approval process for initial certification and recertification. 
Paragraphs (d)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section apply to both initial 
certification and recertification of a continuous monitoring system 
under Sec. 96.170(a)(1). For recertifications, replace the words 
``certification'' and ``initial certification'' with the word 
``recertification'', replace the word ``certified'' with the word 
``recertified,'' and follow the procedures in Sec. Sec. 75.20(b)(5) and 
(g)(7) of this chapter in lieu of the procedures in paragraph (d)(3)(v) 
of this section.
    (i) Notification of certification. The CAIR designated 
representative shall submit to the permitting authority, the appropriate 
EPA Regional Office, and the Administrator written notice of the dates 
of certification testing, in accordance with Sec. 96.173.
    (ii) Certification application. The CAIR designated representative 
shall submit to the permitting authority a certification application for 
each monitoring system. A complete certification application shall 
include the information specified in Sec. 75.63 of this chapter.
    (iii) Provisional certification date. The provisional certification 
date for a monitoring system shall be determined in accordance with 
Sec. 75.20(a)(3) of this chapter. A provisionally certified monitoring 
system may be used under the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Annual Trading Program 
for a period not to exceed 120 days after receipt by the permitting 
authority of the complete certification application for the monitoring 
system under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section. Data measured and 
recorded by the provisionally certified monitoring system, in accordance 
with the requirements of part 75 of this chapter, will be considered 
valid quality-assured data (retroactive to the date and time of 
provisional certification), provided that the permitting authority does 
not invalidate the provisional certification by issuing a notice of 
disapproval within 120 days of the date of receipt of the complete 
certification application by the permitting authority.
    (iv) Certification application approval process. The permitting 
authority will issue a written notice of approval or disapproval of the 
certification application to the owner or operator within

[[Page 80]]

120 days of receipt of the complete certification application under 
paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section. In the event the permitting 
authority does not issue such a notice within such 120-day period, each 
monitoring system that meets the applicable performance requirements of 
part 75 of this chapter and is included in the certification application 
will be deemed certified for use under the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Annual 
Trading Program.
    (A) Approval notice. If the certification application is complete 
and shows that each monitoring system meets the applicable performance 
requirements of part 75 of this chapter, then the permitting authority 
will issue a written notice of approval of the certification application 
within 120 days of receipt.
    (B) Incomplete application notice. If the certification application 
is not complete, then the permitting authority will issue a written 
notice of incompleteness that sets a reasonable date by which the CAIR 
designated representative must submit the additional information 
required to complete the certification application. If the CAIR 
designated representative does not comply with the notice of 
incompleteness by the specified date, then the permitting authority may 
issue a notice of disapproval under paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(C) of this 
section. The 120-day review period shall not begin before receipt of a 
complete certification application.
    (C) Disapproval notice. If the certification application shows that 
any monitoring system does not meet the performance requirements of part 
75 of this chapter or if the certification application is incomplete and 
the requirement for disapproval under paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(B) of this 
section is met, then the permitting authority will issue a written 
notice of disapproval of the certification application. Upon issuance of 
such notice of disapproval, the provisional certification is invalidated 
by the permitting authority and the data measured and recorded by each 
uncertified monitoring system shall not be considered valid quality-
assured data beginning with the date and hour of provisional 
certification (as defined under Sec. 75.20(a)(3) of this chapter). The 
owner or operator shall follow the procedures for loss of certification 
in paragraph (d)(3)(v) of this section for each monitoring system that 
is disapproved for initial certification.
    (D) Audit decertification. The permitting authority or, for a CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit or a unit for which a CAIR opt-in permit 
application is submitted and not withdrawn and a CAIR opt-in permit is 
not yet issued or denied under subpart II of this part, the 
Administrator may issue a notice of disapproval of the certification 
status of a monitor in accordance with Sec. 96.172(b).
    (v) Procedures for loss of certification. If the permitting 
authority or the Administrator issues a notice of disapproval of a 
certification application under paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(C) of this section 
or a notice of disapproval of certification status under paragraph 
(d)(3)(iv)(D) of this section, then:
    (A) The owner or operator shall substitute the following values, for 
each disapproved monitoring system, for each hour of unit operation 
during the period of invalid data specified under Sec. 
75.20(a)(4)(iii), Sec. 75.20(g)(7), or Sec. 75.21(e) of this chapter 
and continuing until the applicable date and hour specified under Sec. 
75.20(a)(5)(i) or (g)(7) of this chapter:

application reveal that any monitoring system should not have been 
certified or recertified because it did not meet a particular 
performance specification or other requirement under Sec. 96.171 or the 
applicable provisions of part 75 of this chapter, both at the time of 
the initial certification or recertification application submission and 
at the time of the audit, the permitting authority or, for a CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit or a unit for which a CAIR opt-in permit 
application is submitted and not withdrawn and a CAIR opt-in permit is 
not yet issued or denied under subpart II of this part, the 
Administrator will issue a notice of disapproval of the certification 
status of such monitoring system. For the purposes of this paragraph, an 
audit shall be either a field audit or an audit of any information 
submitted to the permitting authority or the Administrator. By issuing 
the notice of disapproval, the permitting authority or the Administrator 
revokes prospectively the certification status of the monitoring system. 
The data measured and recorded by the monitoring system shall not be 
considered valid quality-assured data from the date of issuance of the 
notification of the revoked certification status until the date and time 
that the owner or operator completes subsequently approved initial 
certification or recertification tests for the monitoring system. The 
owner or operator shall follow the applicable initial certification or 
recertification procedures in Sec. 96.171 for each disapproved 
monitoring system.

<R05>
Sec. 96.184  Opt-in process.

    The permitting authority will issue or deny a CAIR opt-in permit for 
a unit for which an initial application for a CAIR opt-in permit under 
Sec. 96.183 is submitted in accordance with the following:
    (a) Interim review of monitoring plan. The permitting authority and 
the Administrator will determine, on an interim basis, the sufficiency 
of the monitoring plan accompanying the initial application for a CAIR 
opt-in permit under Sec. 96.183. A monitoring plan is sufficient, for 
purposes of interim review, if the plan appears to contain information 
demonstrating that the NO<INF>X</INF> emissions rate and heat input of 
the unit and all other applicable parameters are monitored and reported 
in accordance with subpart HH of this part. A determination of 
sufficiency shall not be construed as acceptance or approval of the 
monitoring plan.
    (b) Monitoring and reporting. (1)(i) If the permitting authority and 
the Administrator determine that the monitoring plan is sufficient under 
paragraph (a) of this section, the owner or operator shall monitor and 
report the NO<INF>X</INF> emissions rate and the heat input of the unit 
and all other applicable parameters, in accordance with subpart HH of 
this part, starting on the date of certification of the appropriate 
monitoring systems under subpart HH of this part and continuing until a 
CAIR opt-in permit is denied under Sec. 96.184(f) or, if a CAIR opt-in 
permit is issued, the date and time when the unit is withdrawn from the 
CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Annual Trading Program in accordance with Sec. 
96.186.
    (ii) The monitoring and reporting under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this 
section shall include the entire control period immediately before the 
date on which the unit enters the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Annual Trading 
Program under Sec. 96.184(g), during which period monitoring system

[[Page 85]]

availability must not be less than 90 percent under subpart HH of this 
part and the unit must be in full compliance with any applicable State 
or Federal emissions or emissions-related requirements.
    (2) To the extent the NO<INF>X</INF> emissions rate and the heat 
input of the unit are monitored and reported in accordance with subpart 
HH of this part for one or more control periods, in addition to the 
control period under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, during which 
control periods monitoring system availability is not less than 90 
percent under subpart HH of this part and the unit is in full compliance 
with any applicable State or Federal emissions or emissions-related 
requirements and which control periods begin not more than 3 years 
before the unit enters the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Annual Trading Program 
under Sec. 96.184(g), such information shall be used as provided in 
paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.
    (c) Baseline heat input. The unit's baseline heat input shall equal:
    (1) If the unit's NO<INF>X</INF> emissions rate and heat input are 
monitored and reported for only one control period, in accordance with 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the unit's total heat input (in mmBtu) 
for the control period; or
    (2) If the unit's NO<INF>X</INF> emissions rate and heat input are 
monitored and reported for more than one control period, in accordance 
with paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, the average of the 
amounts of the unit's total heat input (in mmBtu) for the control 
periods under paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) and (2) of this section.
    (d) Baseline NO<INF>X</INF> emission rate. The unit's baseline 
NO<INF>X</INF> emission rate shall equal:
    (1) If the unit's NO<INF>X</INF> emissions rate and heat input are 
monitored and reported for only one control period, in accordance with 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the unit's NO<INF>X</INF> emissions 
rate (in lb/mmBtu) for the control period;
    (2) If the unit's NO<INF>X</INF> emissions rate and heat input are 
monitored and reported for more than one control period, in accordance 
with paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, and the unit does not 
have add-on NO<INF>X</INF> emission controls during any such control 
periods, the average of the amounts of the unit's NO<INF>X</INF> 
emissions rate (in lb/mmBtu) for the control periods under paragraphs 
(b)(1)(ii) and (2) of this section; or
    (3) If the unit's NO<INF>X</INF> emissions rate and heat input are 
monitored and reported for more than one control period, in accordance 
with paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, and the unit has add-on 
NO<INF>X</INF> emission controls during any such control periods, the 
average of the amounts of the unit's NO<INF>X</INF> emissions rate (in 
lb/mmBtu) for such control periods during which the unit has add-on 
NO<INF>X</INF> emission controls.
    (e) Issuance of CAIR opt-in permit. After calculating the baseline 
heat input and the baseline NO<INF>X</INF> emissions rate for the unit 
under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section and if the permitting 
authority determines that the CAIR designated representative shows that 
the unit meets the requirements for a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit in 
Sec. 96.180 and meets the elements certified in Sec. 96.183(a)(2), the 
permitting authority will issue a CAIR opt-in permit. The permitting 
authority will provide a copy of the CAIR opt-in permit to the 
Administrator, who will then establish a compliance account for the 
source that includes the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit unless the 
source already has a compliance account.
    (f) Issuance of denial of CAIR opt-in permit. Notwithstanding 
paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section, if at any time before 
issuance of a CAIR opt-in permit for the unit, the permitting authority 
determines that the CAIR designated representative fails to show that 
the unit meets the requirements for a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit in 
Sec. 96.180 or meets the elements certified in Sec. 96.183(a)(2), the 
permitting authority will issue a denial of a CAIR opt-in permit for the 
unit.
    (g) Date of entry into CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Annual Trading Program. A 
unit for which an initial CAIR opt-in permit is issued by the permitting 
authority shall become a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit, and a CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> unit, as of the later of January 1, 2009 or January 1 of 
the first control period during which such CAIR opt-in permit is issued.
    (h) Repowered CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit. (1) If CAIR 
designated representative

[[Page 86]]

requests, and the permitting authority issues a CAIR opt-in permit 
providing for, allocation to a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit of CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances under Sec. 96.188(c) and such unit is 
repowered after its date of entry into the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Annual 
Trading Program under paragraph (g) of this section, the repowered unit 
shall be treated as a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit replacing the 
original CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit, as of the date of start-up of 
the repowered unit's combustion chamber.
    (2) Notwithstanding paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, as of 
the date of start-up under paragraph (h)(1) of this section, the 
repowered unit shall be deemed to have the same date of commencement of 
operation, date of commencement of commercial operation, baseline heat 
input, and baseline NO<INF>X</INF> emission rate as the original CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit, and the original CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in 
unit shall no longer be treated as a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit or 
a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> unit.

Sec. 96.186  Withdrawal from CAIR NOX Annual Trading Program.

    Except as provided under paragraph (g) of this section, a CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit may withdraw from the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
Annual Trading Program, but only if the permitting authority issues a 
notification to the CAIR designated representative of the CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit of the acceptance of the withdrawal of the 
CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit in accordance with paragraph (d) of this 
section.
    (a) Requesting withdrawal. In order to withdraw a CAIR CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit from the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Annual Trading 
Program, the CAIR designated representative of the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
opt-in unit shall submit to the permitting authority a request to 
withdraw effective as of midnight of December 31 of a specified calendar 
year, which date must be at least 4 years after December 31 of the year 
of entry into the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Annual Trading Program under Sec. 
96.184(g). The request must be submitted no later than 90 days before 
the requested effective date of withdrawal.
    (b) Conditions for withdrawal. Before a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in 
unit covered by a request under paragraph (a) of this section may 
withdraw from the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Annual Trading Program and the 
CAIR opt-in permit may be terminated under paragraph (e) of this 
section, the following conditions must be met:
    (1) For the control period ending on the date on which the 
withdrawal is to be effective, the source that includes the CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit must meet the requirement to hold CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances under Sec. 96.106(c) and cannot have any 
excess emissions.

[[Page 87]]

    (2) After the requirement for withdrawal under paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section is met, the Administrator will deduct from the compliance 
account of the source that includes the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit 
CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances equal in amount to and allocated for the 
same or a prior control period as any CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances 
allocated to the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit under Sec. 96.188 for 
any control period for which the withdrawal is to be effective. If there 
are no remaining CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> units at the source, the 
Administrator will close the compliance account, and the owners and 
operators of the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit may submit a CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowance transfer for any remaining CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances to another CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Allowance Tracking System in 
accordance with subpart GG of this part.
    (c) Notification. (1) After the requirements for withdrawal under 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section are met (including deduction of 
the full amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances required), the 
permitting authority will issue a notification to the CAIR designated 
representative of the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit of the acceptance 
of the withdrawal of the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit as of midnight 
on December 31 of the calendar year for which the withdrawal was 
requested.
    (2) If the requirements for withdrawal under paragraphs (a) and (b) 
of this section are not met, the permitting authority will issue a 
notification to the CAIR designated representative of the CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit that the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit's 
request to withdraw is denied. Such CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit 
shall continue to be a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit.
    (d) Permit amendment. After the permitting authority issues a 
notification under paragraph (c)(1) of this section that the 
requirements for withdrawal have been met, the permitting authority will 
revise the CAIR permit covering the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit to 
terminate the CAIR opt-in permit for such unit as of the effective date 
specified under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The unit shall 
continue to be a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit until the effective 
date of the termination and shall comply with all requirements under the 
CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Annual Trading Program concerning any control 
periods for which the unit is a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit, even if 
such requirements arise or must be complied with after the withdrawal 
takes effect.
    (e) Reapplication upon failure to meet conditions of withdrawal. If 
the permitting authority denies the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit's 
request to withdraw, the CAIR designated representative may submit 
another request to withdraw in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b) of 
this section.
    (f) Ability to reapply to the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Annual Trading 
Program. Once a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit withdraws from the CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Annual Trading Program and its CAIR opt-in permit is 
terminated under this section, the CAIR designated representative may 
not submit another application for a CAIR opt-in permit under Sec. 
96.183 for such CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit before the date that is 
4 years after the date on which the withdrawal became effective. Such 
new application for a CAIR opt-in permit will be treated as an initial 
application for a CAIR opt-in permit under Sec. 96.184.
    (g) Inability to withdraw. Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) through 
(f) of this section, a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit shall not be 
eligible to withdraw from the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Annual Trading Program 
if the CAIR designated representative of the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in 
unit requests, and the permitting authority issues a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
opt-in permit providing for, allocation to the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-
in unit of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances under Sec. 96.188(c).

opt-in unit that becomes a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> unit under Sec. 96.104 
contains the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances necessary for completion of 
the deduction under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.
    (3)(i) For every control period after the date on which the CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit becomes a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> unit under 
Sec. 96.104, the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit will be allocated CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances under Sec. 96.142.
    (ii) If the date on which the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit 
becomes a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> unit under Sec. 96.104 is not December 
31, the following amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances will be 
allocated to the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit (as a CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> unit) under Sec. 96.142 for the control period that 
includes the date on which the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit becomes a

opt-in units.

    (a) Timing requirements. (1) When the CAIR opt-in permit is issued 
under Sec. 96.184(e), the permitting authority will allocate CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances to the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit, and 
submit to the Administrator the allocation for the control period in 
which a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit enters the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
Annual Trading Program under Sec. 96.184(g), in accordance with 
paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.

control period in which a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit enters the 
CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Annual Trading Program under Sec. 96.184(g) and 
October 31 of each year thereafter, the permitting authority will 
allocate CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances to the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-
in unit, and submit to the Administrator the allocation for the control 
period that includes such submission deadline and in which the unit is a 
CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit, in accordance with paragraph (b) or (c) 
of this section.
    (b) Calculation of allocation. For each control period for which a 
CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit is to be allocated CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances, the permitting authority will allocate in accordance with 
the following procedures:
    (1) The heat input (in mmBtu) used for calculating the CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowance allocation will be the lesser of:

issued by the permitting authority under subpart CCC of this part for 
the source and operate the source and the unit in compliance with such 
CAIR permit.
    (3) Except as provided in subpart III of this part, the owners and 
operators of a CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> source that is not otherwise required

that is not otherwise required to have a title V operating permit are 
not required to submit a CAIR permit application, and to have a CAIR

source and such CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> unit.
    (b) Monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements. (1) The 
owners and operators, and the CAIR designated representative, of each

equivalent in CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances available for compliance 
deductions for the control period, as determined in accordance with 
Sec. 96.254(a) and (b), not less than the tons of total sulfur dioxide

    (g) Effect on other authorities. No provision of the CAIR 
SO<INF>2</INF> Trading Program, a CAIR permit application, a CAIR

will record in the compliance account any CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowance 
allocated to any CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> unit at the source for each of the 
30 years starting the later of 2010 or the year in which the compliance 
account is established and any CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowance allocated 
for each of the 30 years starting the later of 2010 or the year in which 
the compliance account is established and transferred to the source in 
accordance with subpart GGG of this part or subpart D of part 73 of this 
chapter.
    (2) In 2011 and each year thereafter, after Administrator has 
completed all deductions under Sec. 96.254(b), the Administrator will 
record in the compliance account any CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowance 
allocated to any CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> unit at the source for the new 30th 
year (i.e., the year that is 30 years after the calendar year for which 
such deductions are or could be made) and any CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> 
allowance allocated for the new 30th year and transferred to the source 
in accordance with subpart GGG of this part or subpart D of part 73 of

<R05>
Sec. 96.254  Compliance with CAIR SO[bdi2] emissions limitation.

    (a) Allowance transfer deadline. The CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances 
are available to be deducted for compliance with a source's CAIR 
SO<INF>2</INF> emissions limitation for a control period in a given 
calendar year only if the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances:
    (1) Were allocated for the control period in the year or a prior 
year; and
    (2) Are held in the compliance account as of the allowance transfer 
deadline for the control period or are transferred into the compliance 
account by a CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowance transfer correctly submitted 
for recordation under Sec. Sec. 96.260 and 96.261 by the allowance 
transfer deadline for the control period.
    (b) Deductions for compliance. Following the recordation, in 
accordance with Sec. 96.261, of CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowance transfers 
submitted for recordation in a source's compliance account by the 
allowance transfer deadline for a control period, the Administrator will 
deduct from the compliance account CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances 
available under paragraph (a) of this section in order to determine 
whether the source meets

[[Page 112]]

the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> emissions limitation for the control period as 
follows:
    (1) For a CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> source subject to an Acid Rain 
emissions limitation, the Administrator will, in the following order:
    (i) Deduct the amount of CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances, available 
under paragraph (a) of this section and not issued by a permitting 
authority under Sec. 96.288, that is required under Sec. Sec. 73.35(b) 
and (c) of this part. If there are sufficient CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> 
allowances to complete this deduction, the deduction will be treated as 
satisfying the requirements of Sec. Sec. 73.35(b) and (c) of this 
chapter.
    (ii) Deduct the amount of CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances, not issued 
by a permitting authority under Sec. 96.288, that is required under 
Sec. Sec. 73.35(d) and 77.5 of this part. If there are sufficient CAIR 
SO<INF>2</INF> allowances to complete this deduction, the deduction will 
be treated as satisfying the requirements of Sec. Sec. 73.35(d) and 
77.5 of this chapter.
    (iii) Treating the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances deducted under 
paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section as also being deducted under this 
paragraph (b)(1)(iii), deduct CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances available 
under paragraph (a) of this section (including any issued by a 
permitting authority under Sec. 96.288) in order to determine whether 
the source meets the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> emissions limitation for the 
control period, as follows:
    (A) Until the tonnage equivalent of the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> 
allowances deducted equals, or exceeds in accordance with paragraphs 
(c)(1) and (2) of this section, the number of tons of total sulfur 
dioxide emissions, determined in accordance with subpart HHH of this 
part, from all CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> units at the source for the control 
period; or
    (B) If there are insufficient CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances to 
complete the deductions in paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(A) of this section, 
until no more CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances available under paragraph 
(a) of this section (including any issued by a permitting authority 
under Sec. 96.288) remain in the compliance account.
    (2) For a CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> source not subject to an Acid Rain 
emissions limitation, the Administrator will deduct CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> 
allowances available under paragraph (a) of this section (including any 
issued by a permitting authority under Sec. 96.288) in order to 
determine whether the source meets the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> emissions 
limitation for the control period, as follows:
    (i) Until the tonnage equivalent of the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> 
allowances deducted equals, or exceeds in accordance with paragraphs 
(c)(1) and (2) of this section, the number of tons of total sulfur 
dioxide emissions, determined in accordance with subpart HHH of this 
part, from all CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> units at the source for the control 
period; or
    (ii) If there are insufficient CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances to 
complete the deductions in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, until no 
more CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances available under paragraph (a) of 
this section (including any issued by a permitting authority under Sec. 
96.288) remain in the compliance account.
    (c)(1) Identification of CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances by serial 
number. The CAIR authorized account representative for a source's 
compliance account may request that specific CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> 
allowances, identified by serial number, in the compliance account be 
deducted for emissions or excess emissions for a control period in 
accordance with paragraph (b) or (d) of this section. Such request shall 
be submitted to the Administrator by the allowance transfer deadline for 
the control period and include, in a format prescribed by the 
Administrator, the identification of the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> source and 
the appropriate serial numbers.
    (2) First-in, first-out. The Administrator will deduct CAIR 
SO<INF>2</INF> allowances under paragraph (b) or (d) of this section 
from the source's compliance account, in the absence of an 
identification or in the case of a partial identification of CAIR 
SO<INF>2</INF> allowances by serial number under paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section, on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) accounting basis in the 
following order:
    (i) Any CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances that were allocated to the 
units at the source for a control period before 2010, in the order of 
recordation;
    (ii) Any CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances that were allocated to any 
entity for a control period before 2010 and transferred and recorded in 
the compliance account pursuant to subpart GGG of this

[[Page 113]]

part or subpart D of part 73 of this chapter, in the order of 
recordation;
    (iii) Any CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances that were allocated to the 
units at the source for a control period during 2010 through 2014, in 
the order of recordation;
    (iv) Any CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances that were allocated to any 
entity for a control period during 2010 through 2014 and transferred and 
recorded in the compliance account pursuant to subpart GGG of this part 
or subpart D of part 73 of this chapter, in the order of recordation;
    (v) Any CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances that were allocated to the 
units at the source for a control period in 2015 or later, in the order 
of recordation; and
    (vi) Any CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances that were allocated to any 
entity for a control period in 2015 or later and transferred and 
recorded in the compliance account pursuant to subpart GGG of this part 
or subpart D of part 73 of this chapter, in the order of recordation.
    (d) Deductions for excess emissions. (1) After making the deductions 
for compliance under paragraph (b) of this section for a control period 
in a calendar year in which the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> source has excess 
emissions, the Administrator will deduct from the source's compliance 
account the tonnage equivalent in CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances, 
allocated for the control period in the immediately following calendar 
year (including any issued by a permitting authority under Sec. 
96.288), equal to, or exceeding in accordance with paragraphs (c)(1) and 
(2) of this section, 3 times the following amount: the number of tons of 
the source's excess emissions minus, if the source is subject to an Acid 
Rain emissions limitation, the amount of the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> 
allowances required to be deducted under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this 
section.
    (2) Any allowance deduction required under paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section shall not affect the liability of the owners and operators of 
the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> source or the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> units at the 
source for any fine, penalty, or assessment, or their obligation to 
comply with any other remedy, for the same violations, as ordered under 
the Clean Air Act or applicable State law.
    (e) Recordation of deductions. The Administrator will record in the 
appropriate compliance account all deductions from such an account under 
paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section and subpart III.

certification requirements under paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) [Reserved]
    (d) Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, the owner 
or operator of a CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> unit shall comply with the 
following initial certification and recertification procedures, for a 
continuous monitoring system (i.e., a continuous emission monitoring 
system and an excepted monitoring system under appendix D to part 75 of 
this chapter) under Sec. 96.270(a)(1). The owner or operator of a unit 
that qualifies to use the low mass emissions excepted monitoring 
methodology under Sec. 75.19 of this chapter or that qualifies to use 
an alternative monitoring system under subpart E of part 75 of this 
chapter shall comply with the procedures in paragraph (e) or (f) of this 
section respectively.
    (1) Requirements for initial certification. The owner or operator 
shall ensure that each continuous monitoring system under Sec. 
96.270(a)(1) (including the automated data acquisition and handling 
system) successfully completes all of the initial certification testing 
required under Sec. 75.20 of this chapter by the applicable deadline in 
Sec. 96.270(b). In addition, whenever the owner or operator installs a 
monitoring system to meet the requirements of this subpart in a location 
where no such monitoring system was previously installed, initial 
certification in accordance with Sec. 75.20 of this chapter is 
required.
    (2) Requirements for recertification. Whenever the owner or operator 
makes a replacement, modification, or change in any certified continuous 
emission monitoring system under Sec. 96.270(a)(1) that may 
significantly affect the ability of the system to accurately measure or 
record SO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions or heat input rate or to meet the 
quality-assurance and quality-control requirements of Sec. 75.21 of 
this chapter or appendix B to part 75 of this chapter, the owner or 
operator shall recertify the monitoring system in accordance with Sec. 
75.20(b) of this chapter. Furthermore, whenever the owner or operator 
makes a replacement, modification, or change to the flue gas handling 
system or the unit's operation that may significantly change the stack 
flow or concentration profile, the owner or operator shall recertify 
each continuous emission monitoring system whose accuracy is potentially 
affected by the change, in accordance with Sec. 75.20(b) of this 
chapter. Examples of changes to a continuous emission monitoring system 
that require recertification include: replacement of the analyzer, 
complete replacement of an existing continuous emission monitoring 
system, or change in location or orientation of the sampling probe or 
site. Any fuel flowmeter system under Sec. 96.270(a)(1) is subject to 
the recertification requirements in Sec. 75.20(g)(6) of this chapter.
    (3) Approval process for initial certification and recertification. 
Paragraphs (d)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section apply to both initial 
certification and recertification of a continuous monitoring system 
under Sec. 96.270(a)(1). For recertifications, replace the words 
``certification'' and ``initial certification'' with the word 
``recertification'', replace the word ``certified'' with the word 
``recertified,'' and follow the procedures in Sec. Sec. 75.20(b)(5) and 
(g)(7) of this chapter in lieu of the procedures in paragraph (d)(3)(v) 
of this section.
    (i) Notification of certification. The CAIR designated 
representative shall submit to the permitting authority, the appropriate 
EPA Regional Office, and the Administrator written notice of the dates 
of certification testing, in accordance with Sec. 96.273.

[[Page 118]]

    (ii) Certification application. The CAIR designated representative 
shall submit to the permitting authority a certification application for 
each monitoring system. A complete certification application shall 
include the information specified in Sec. 75.63 of this chapter.
    (iii) Provisional certification date. The provisional certification 
date for a monitoring system shall be determined in accordance with 
Sec. 75.20(a)(3) of this chapter. A provisionally certified monitoring 
system may be used under the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> Trading Program for a 
period not to exceed 120 days after receipt by the permitting authority 
of the complete certification application for the monitoring system 
under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section. Data measured and recorded 
by the provisionally certified monitoring system, in accordance with the 
requirements of part 75 of this chapter, will be considered valid 
quality-assured data (retroactive to the date and time of provisional 
certification), provided that the permitting authority does not 
invalidate the provisional certification by issuing a notice of 
disapproval within 120 days of the date of receipt of the complete 
certification application by the permitting authority.
    (iv) Certification application approval process. The permitting 
authority will issue a written notice of approval or disapproval of the 
certification application to the owner or operator within 120 days of 
receipt of the complete certification application under paragraph 
(d)(3)(ii) of this section. In the event the permitting authority does 
not issue such a notice within such 120-day period, each monitoring 
system that meets the applicable performance requirements of part 75 of 
this chapter and is included in the certification application will be 
deemed certified for use under the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> Trading Program.
    (A) Approval notice. If the certification application is complete 
and shows that each monitoring system meets the applicable performance 
requirements of part 75 of this chapter, then the permitting authority 
will issue a written notice of approval of the certification application 
within 120 days of receipt.
    (B) Incomplete application notice. If the certification application 
is not complete, then the permitting authority will issue a written 
notice of incompleteness that sets a reasonable date by which the CAIR 
designated representative must submit the additional information 
required to complete the certification application. If the CAIR 
designated representative does not comply with the notice of 
incompleteness by the specified date, then the permitting authority may 
issue a notice of disapproval under paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(C) of this 
section. The 120-day review period shall not begin before receipt of a 
complete certification application.
    (C) Disapproval notice. If the certification application shows that 
any monitoring system does not meet the performance requirements of part 
75 of this chapter or if the certification application is incomplete and 
the requirement for disapproval under paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(B) of this 
section is met, then the permitting authority will issue a written 
notice of disapproval of the certification application. Upon issuance of 
such notice of disapproval, the provisional certification is invalidated 
by the permitting authority and the data measured and recorded by each 
uncertified monitoring system shall not be considered valid quality-
assured data beginning with the date and hour of provisional 
certification (as defined under Sec. 75.20(a)(3) of this chapter). The 
owner or operator shall follow the procedures for loss of certification 
in paragraph (d)(3)(v) of this section for each monitoring system that 
is disapproved for initial certification.
    (D) Audit decertification. The permitting authority or, for a CAIR 
SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit or a unit for which a CAIR opt-in permit 
application is submitted and not withdrawn and a CAIR opt-in permit is 
not yet issued or denied under subpart III of this part, the 
Administrator may issue a notice of disapproval of the certification 
status of a monitor in accordance with Sec. 96.272(b).
    (v) Procedures for loss of certification. If the permitting 
authority or the Administrator issues a notice of disapproval of a 
certification application under paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(C) of this

[[Page 119]]

section or a notice of disapproval of certification status under 
paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(D) of this section, then:
    (A) The owner or operator shall substitute the following values, for 
each disapproved monitoring system, for each hour of unit operation 
during the period of invalid data specified under Sec. 
75.20(a)(4)(iii), Sec. 75.20(g)(7), or Sec. 75.21(e) of this chapter 
and continuing until the applicable date and hour specified under Sec. 
75.20(a)(5)(i) or (g)(7) of this chapter:
    (1) For a disapproved SO<INF>2</INF> pollutant concentration monitor 
and disapproved flow monitor, respectively, the maximum potential 
concentration of SO<INF>2</INF> and the maximum potential flow rate, as 
defined in sections 2.1.1.1 and 2.1.4.1 of appendix A to part 75 of this 
chapter.
    (2) For a disapproved moisture monitoring system and disapproved 
diluent gas monitoring system, respectively, the minimum potential 
moisture percentage and either the maximum potential CO<INF>2</INF> 
concentration or the minimum potential O<INF>2</INF> concentration (as 
applicable), as defined in sections 2.1.5, 2.1.3.1, and 2.1.3.2 of 
appendix A to part 75 of this chapter.
    (3) For a disapproved fuel flowmeter system, the maximum potential 
fuel flow rate, as defined in section 2.4.2.1 of appendix D to part 75 
of this chapter.
    (B) The CAIR designated representative shall submit a notification 
of certification retest dates and a new certification application in 
accordance with paragraphs (d)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section.
    (C) The owner or operator shall repeat all certification tests or 
other requirements that were failed by the monitoring system, as 
indicated in the permitting authority's or the Administrator's notice of 
disapproval, no later than 30 unit operating days after the date of 
issuance of the notice of disapproval.
    (e) Initial certification and recertification procedures for units 
using the low mass emission excepted methodology under Sec. 75.19 of 
this chapter. The owner or operator of a unit qualified to use the low 
mass emissions (LME) excepted methodology under Sec. 75.19 of this 
chapter shall meet the applicable certification and recertification 
requirements in Sec. Sec. 75.19(a)(2) and 75.20(h) of this chapter. If 
the owner or operator of such a unit elects to certify a fuel flowmeter 
system for heat input determination, the owner or operator shall also 
meet the certification and recertification requirements in Sec. 
75.20(g) of this chapter.
    (f) Certification/recertification procedures for alternative 
monitoring systems. The CAIR designated representative of each unit for 
which the owner or operator intends to use an alternative monitoring 
system approved by the Administrator and, if applicable, the permitting 
authority under subpart E of part 75 of this chapter shall comply with

Sec. 96.272  Out of control periods.

    (a) Whenever any monitoring system fails to meet the quality-
assurance and quality-control requirements or data validation 
requirements of part 75 of this chapter, data shall be substituted using 
the applicable missing data procedures in subpart D of or appendix D to 
part 75 of this chapter.
    (b) Audit decertification. Whenever both an audit of a monitoring 
system and a review of the initial certification or recertification 
application reveal that any monitoring system should not have been 
certified or recertified because it did not meet a particular 
performance specification or other requirement under Sec. 96.271 or the 
applicable provisions of part 75 of this chapter, both at the time of 
the initial certification or recertification application submission and 
at the time of the audit, the permitting authority or, for a CAIR 
SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit or a unit for which a CAIR opt-in permit 
application is submitted and not withdrawn and a CAIR opt-in permit is 
not yet issued or denied under subpart III of this part, the 
Administrator will issue a notice of disapproval of the certification 
status of such monitoring system. For the purposes of this paragraph, an 
audit shall be either a field audit or an audit of any information 
submitted to the permitting authority or the Administrator. By issuing 
the notice of disapproval, the permitting authority or

[[Page 120]]

the Administrator revokes prospectively the certification status of the 
monitoring system. The data measured and recorded by the monitoring 
system shall not be considered valid quality-assured data from the date 
of issuance of the notification of the revoked certification status 
until the date and time that the owner or operator completes

Sec. 96.284  Opt-in process.

    The permitting authority will issue or deny a CAIR opt-in permit for 
a unit for which an initial application for a CAIR opt-in permit under 
Sec. 96.283 is submitted in accordance with the following:
    (a) Interim review of monitoring plan. The permitting authority and 
the Administrator will determine, on an interim basis, the sufficiency 
of the monitoring plan accompanying the initial application for a CAIR 
opt-in permit under Sec. 96.283. A monitoring plan is sufficient, for 
purposes of interim review, if the plan appears to contain information 
demonstrating that the SO<INF>2</INF> emissions rate and heat input of 
the unit and all other applicable parameters are monitored and reported 
in accordance with subpart HHH of this part. A determination of 
sufficiency shall not be construed as acceptance or approval of the 
monitoring plan.
    (b) Monitoring and reporting. (1)(i) If the permitting authority and 
the Administrator determine that the monitoring plan is sufficient under 
paragraph (a) of this section, the owner or operator shall monitor and 
report the SO<INF>2</INF> emissions rate and the heat input of the unit 
and all other applicable parameters, in accordance with subpart HHH of 
this part, starting on the date

[[Page 123]]

of certification of the appropriate monitoring systems under subpart HHH 
of this part and continuing until a CAIR opt-in permit is denied under 
Sec. 96.284(f) or, if a CAIR opt-in permit is issued, the date and time 
when the unit is withdrawn from the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> Trading Program 
in accordance with Sec. 96.286.
    (ii) The monitoring and reporting under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this 
section shall include the entire control period immediately before the 
date on which the unit enters the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> Trading Program 
under Sec. 96.284(g), during which period monitoring system 
availability must not be less than 90 percent under subpart HHH of this 
part and the unit must be in full compliance with any applicable State 
or Federal emissions or emissions-related requirements.
    (2) To the extent the SO<INF>2</INF> emissions rate and the heat 
input of the unit are monitored and reported in accordance with subpart 
HHH of this part for one or more control periods, in addition to the 
control period under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, during which 
control periods monitoring system availability is not less than 90 
percent under subpart HHH of this part and the unit is in full 
compliance with any applicable State or Federal emissions or emissions-
related requirements and which control periods begin not more than 3 
years before the unit enters the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> Trading Program 
under Sec. 96.284(g), such information shall be used as provided in 
paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.
    (c) Baseline heat input. The unit's baseline heat input shall equal:
    (1) If the unit's SO<INF>2</INF> emissions rate and heat input are 
monitored and reported for only one control period, in accordance with 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the unit's total heat input (in mmBtu) 
for the control period; or
    (2) If the unit's SO<INF>2</INF> emissions rate and heat input are 
monitored and reported for more than one control period, in accordance 
with paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, the average of the 
amounts of the unit's total heat input (in mmBtu) for the control 
periods under paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) and (2) of this section and the 
control periods under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (d) Baseline SO<INF>2</INF> emission rate. The unit's baseline 
SO<INF>2</INF> emission rate shall equal:
    (1) If the unit's SO<INF>2</INF> emissions rate and heat input are 
monitored and reported for only one control period, in accordance with 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the unit's SO<INF>2</INF> emissions 
rate (in lb/mmBtu) for the control period;
    (2) If the unit's SO<INF>2</INF> emissions rate and heat input are 
monitored and reported for more than one control period, in accordance 
with paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, and the unit does not 
have add-on SO<INF>2</INF> emission controls during any such control 
periods, the average of the amounts of the unit's SO<INF>2</INF> 
emissions rate (in lb/mmBtu) for the control periods under paragraphs 
(b)(1)(ii) and (2) of this section; or
    (3) If the unit's SO<INF>2</INF> emissions rate and heat input are 
monitored and reported for more than one control period, in accordance 
with paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, and the unit has add-on 
SO<INF>2</INF> emission controls during any such control periods, the 
average of the amounts of the unit's SO<INF>2</INF> emissions rate (in 
lb/mmBtu) for such control periods during which the unit has add-on 
SO<INF>2</INF> emission controls.
    (e) Issuance of CAIR opt-in permit. After calculating the baseline 
heat input and the baseline SO<INF>2</INF> emissions rate for the unit 
under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section and if the permitting 
authority determines that the CAIR designated representative shows that 
the unit meets the requirements for a CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit in 
Sec. 96.280 and meets the elements certified in Sec. 96.283(a)(2), the 
permitting authority will issue a CAIR opt-in permit. The permitting 
authority will provide a copy of the CAIR opt-in permit to the 
Administrator, who will then establish a compliance account for the 
source that includes the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit unless the 
source already has a compliance account.
    (f) Issuance of denial of CAIR opt-in permit. Notwithstanding 
paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section, if at any time before 
issuance of a CAIR opt-in permit for the unit, the permitting authority 
determines that the CAIR designated representative fails to show

[[Page 124]]

that the unit meets the requirements for a CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in 
unit in Sec. 96.280 or meets the elements certified in Sec. 
96.283(a)(2), the permitting authority will issue a denial of a CAIR 
opt-in permit for the unit.
    (g) Date of entry into CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> Trading Program. A unit 
for which an initial CAIR opt-in permit is issued by the permitting 
authority shall become a CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit, and a CAIR 
SO<INF>2</INF> unit, as of the later of January 1, 2010 or January 1 of 
the first control period during which such CAIR opt-in permit is issued.
    (h) Repowered CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit. (1) If CAIR 
designated representative requests, and the permitting authority issues 
a CAIR opt-in permit providing for, allocation to a CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> 
opt-in unit of CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances under Sec. 96.288(c) and 
such unit is repowered after its date of entry into the CAIR 
SO<INF>2</INF> Trading Program under paragraph (g) of this section, the 
repowered unit shall be treated as a CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit 
replacing the original CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit, as of the date 
of start-up of the repowered unit's combustion chamber.
    (2) Notwithstanding paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, as of 
the date of start-up under paragraph (h)(1) of this section, the 
repowered unit shall be deemed to have the same date of commencement of 
operation, date of commencement of commercial operation, baseline heat 
input, and baseline SO<INF>2</INF> emission rate as the original CAIR 
SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit, and the original CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in 
unit shall no longer be treated as a CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit or 
a CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> unit.

Sec. 96.286  Withdrawal from CAIR SO[bdi2] Trading Program.

    Except as provided under paragraph (g) of this section, a CAIR 
SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit may withdraw from the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> 
Trading Program, but only if the permitting authority issues a 
notification to the CAIR designated representative of the CAIR 
SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit of the acceptance of the withdrawal of the 
CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit in accordance with paragraph (d) of this 
section.
    (a) Requesting withdrawal. In order to withdraw a CAIR 
SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit from the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> Trading Program, 
the CAIR designated representative of the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in 
unit shall submit to the permitting authority a request to withdraw 
effective as of midnight of December 31 of a specified calendar year, 
which date must be at least 4 years after December 31 of the year of 
entry into the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> Trading Program under Sec. 
96.284(g). The request must be submitted no later than 90

[[Page 125]]

days before the requested effective date of withdrawal.
    (b) Conditions for withdrawal. Before a CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in 
unit covered by a request under paragraph (a) of this section may 
withdraw from the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> Trading Program and the CAIR opt-
in permit may be terminated under paragraph (e) of this section, the 
following conditions must be met:
    (1) For the control period ending on the date on which the 
withdrawal is to be effective, the source that includes the CAIR 
SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit must meet the requirement to hold CAIR 
SO<INF>2</INF> allowances under Sec. 96.206(c) and cannot have any 
excess emissions.
    (2) After the requirement for withdrawal under paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section is met, the Administrator will deduct from the compliance 
account of the source that includes the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit 
CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances equal in amount to and allocated for the 
same or a prior control period as any CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances 
allocated to the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit under Sec. 96.288 for 
any control period for which the withdrawal is to be effective. If there 
are no remaining CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> units at the source, the 
Administrator will close the compliance account, and the owners and 
operators of the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit may submit a CAIR 
SO<INF>2</INF> allowance transfer for any remaining CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> 
allowances to another CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> Allowance Tracking System in 
accordance with subpart GGG of this part.
    (c) Notification. (1) After the requirements for withdrawal under 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section are met (including deduction of 
the full amount of CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances required), the 
permitting authority will issue a notification to the CAIR designated 
representative of the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit of the acceptance 
of the withdrawal of the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit as of midnight 
on December 31 of the calendar year for which the withdrawal was 
requested.
    (2) If the requirements for withdrawal under paragraphs (a) and (b) 
of this section are not met, the permitting authority will issue a 
notification to the CAIR designated representative of the CAIR 
SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit that the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit's 
request to withdraw is denied. Such CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit 
shall continue to be a CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit.
    (d) Permit amendment. After the permitting authority issues a 
notification under paragraph (c)(1) of this section that the 
requirements for withdrawal have been met, the permitting authority will 
revise the CAIR permit covering the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit to 
terminate the CAIR opt-in permit for such unit as of the effective date 
specified under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The unit shall 
continue to be a CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit until the effective 
date of the termination and shall comply with all requirements under the 
CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> Trading Program concerning any control periods for 
which the unit is a CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit, even if such 
requirements arise or must be complied with after the withdrawal takes 
effect.
    (e) Reapplication upon failure to meet conditions of withdrawal. If 
the permitting authority denies the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit's 
request to withdraw, the CAIR designated representative may submit 
another request to withdraw in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b) of 
this section.
    (f) Ability to reapply to the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> Trading Program. 
Once a CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit withdraws from the CAIR 
SO<INF>2</INF> Trading Program and its CAIR opt-in permit is terminated 
under this section, the CAIR designated representative may not submit 
another application for a CAIR opt-in permit under Sec. 96.283 for such 
CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit before the date that is 4 years after 
the date on which the withdrawal became effective. Such new application 
for a CAIR opt-in permit will be treated as an initial application for a 
CAIR opt-in permit under Sec. 96.284.

Sec. 96.287  Change in regulatory status.

    (a) Notification. If a CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit becomes a 
CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> unit under Sec. 96.204, then the CAIR designated 
representative shall notify in writing the permitting authority and the 
Administrator of such change in the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit's 
regulatory status, within 30 days of such change.
    (b) Permitting authority's and Administrator's actions. (1) If a 
CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit becomes a CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> unit under 
Sec. 96.204, the permitting authority will revise the CAIR 
SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit's CAIR opt-in permit to meet the requirements 
of a CAIR permit under Sec. 96.223, and remove the CAIR opt-in permit 
provisions, as of the date on which the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit 
becomes a CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> unit under Sec. 96.204.
    (2)(i) The Administrator will deduct from the compliance account of 
the source that includes a CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit that becomes 
a CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> unit under Sec. 96.204, CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> 
allowances equal in amount to and allocated for the same or a prior 
control period as:
    (A) Any CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances allocated to the CAIR 
SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit under Sec. 96.288 for any control period 
after the date on which the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit becomes a 
CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> unit under Sec. 96.204; and
    (B) If the date on which the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit becomes 
a CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> unit under Sec. 96.204 is not December 31, the 
CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances allocated to the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-
in unit under Sec. 96.288 for the control period that includes the date 
on which the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit becomes a CAIR 
SO<INF>2</INF> unit under Sec. 96.204, multiplied by the ratio of the 
number of days, in the control period, starting with the date on which 
the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit becomes a CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> unit 
under Sec. 96.204 divided by the total number of days in the control 
period and rounded to the nearest whole allowance as appropriate.
    (ii) The CAIR designated representative shall ensure that the 
compliance account of the source that includes the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> 
opt-in unit that becomes a CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> unit under Sec. 96.204 
contains the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances necessary for completion of 
the deduction under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 96.342  CAIR NOX Ozone Season allowance allocations.

    (a)(1) The baseline heat input (in mmBtu) used with respect to CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowance allocations under paragraph (b) of 
this section for each CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season unit will be:
    (i) For units commencing operation before January 1, 2001 the 
average of the 3 highest amounts of the unit's adjusted control period 
heat input for 2000 through 2004, with the adjusted control period heat 
input for each year calculated as follows:
    (A) If the unit is coal-fired during the year, the unit's control 
period heat input for such year is multiplied by 100 percent;
    (B) If the unit is oil-fired during the year, the unit's control 
period heat input for such year is multiplied by 60 percent; and
    (C) If the unit is not subject to paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) or (B) of 
this section, the unit's control period heat input for such year is 
multiplied by 40 percent.
    (ii) For units commencing operation on or after January 1, 2001 and 
operating each calendar year during a period of 5 or more consecutive 
calendar years, the average of the 3 highest amounts of the unit's total 
converted control period heat input over the first such 5 years.
    (2)(i) A unit's control period heat input, and a unit's status as 
coal-fired or oil-fired, for a calendar year under paragraph (a)(1)(i) 
of this section, and a unit's total tons of NO<INF>X</INF> emissions 
during a control period in a calendar year under paragraph (c)(3) of 
this section, will be determined in accordance with part 75 of this 
chapter, to the extent the unit was otherwise subject to the 
requirements of part 75 of this chapter for the year, or will be based 
on the best available data reported to the permitting authority for the 
unit, to the extent the unit was not otherwise subject to the 
requirements of part 75 of this chapter for the year.
    (ii) A unit's converted control period heat input for a calendar 
year specified under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section equals:
    (A) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(B) or (C) of this 
section, the control period gross electrical output of the generator or 
generators served by the unit multiplied by 7,900 Btu/kWh, if the unit 
is coal-fired for the year, or 6,675 Btu/kWh, if the unit is not coal-
fired for the year, and divided by 1,000,000 Btu/mmBtu, provided that if 
a generator is served by 2 or more units, then the gross electrical 
output of the generator will be attributed to each unit in proportion to 
the unit's share of the total control period heat input of such units 
for the year;
    (B) For a unit that is a boiler and has equipment used to produce 
electricity and useful thermal energy for industrial, commercial, 
heating, or cooling purposes through the sequential use of energy, the 
total heat energy (in Btu) of the steam produced by the boiler during 
the control period, divided by 0.8 and by 1,000,000 Btu/mmBtu; or
    (C) For a unit that is a combustion turbine and has equipment used 
to produce electricity and useful thermal energy for industrial, 
commercial, heating, or cooling purposes through the sequential use of 
energy, the control period gross electrical output of the enclosed 
device comprising the compressor, combustor, and turbine multiplied by 
3,413 Btu/kWh, plus the total heat energy (in Btu) of the steam produced 
by any associated heat recovery steam generator during the control 
period divided by 0.8, and with the sum divided by 1,000,000 Btu/mmBtu.
    (b)(1) For each control period in 2009 and thereafter, the 
permitting authority will allocate to all CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone 
Season units in the State that have a baseline heat input (as determined 
under paragraph (a) of this section) a total amount of CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances equal to 95 percent for a control 
period during 2009 through 2014, and 97 percent for a control period 
during 2015 and thereafter, of the tons of NO<INF>X</INF> emissions in 
the State trading budget under Sec. 96.340 (except as provided in 
paragraph (d) of this section).
    (2) The permitting authority will allocate CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone 
Season allowances to each CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season unit under 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section in an amount determined by multiplying 
the total amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances 
allocated under paragraph (b)(1) of this section by the ratio of the 
baseline heat input

[[Page 148]]

of such CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season unit to the total amount of 
baseline heat input of all such CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season units 
in the State and rounding to the nearest whole allowance as appropriate.
    (c) For each control period in 2009 and thereafter, the permitting 
authority will allocate CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances to 
CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season units in a State that are not allocated 
CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances under paragraph (b) of this 
section because the units do not yet have a baseline heat input under 
paragraph (a) of this section or because the units have a baseline heat 
input but all CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances available 
under paragraph (b) of this section for the control period are already 
allocated, in accordance with the following procedures:
    (1) The permitting authority will establish a separate new unit set-
aside for each control period. Each new unit set-aside will be allocated 
CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances equal to 5 percent for a 
control period in2009 through 2014, and 3 percent for a control period 
in 2015 and thereafter, of the amount of tons of NO<INF>X</INF> 
emissions in the State trading budget under Sec. 96.340.
    (2) The CAIR designated representative of such a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
Ozone Season unit may submit to the permitting authority a request, in a 
format specified by the permitting authority, to be allocated CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances, starting with the later of the 
control period in 2009 or the first control period after the control 
period in which the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season unit commences 
commercial operation and until the first control period for which the 
unit is allocated CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances under 
paragraph (b) of this section. A separate CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone 
Season allowance allocation request for each control period for which 
CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances are sought must be submitted 
on or before February 1 before such control period and after the date on 
which the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season unit commences commercial 
operation.
    (3) In a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowance allocation 
request under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the CAIR designated 
representative may request for a control period CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
Ozone Season allowances in an amount not exceeding the CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season unit's total tons of NO<INF>X</INF> 
emissions during the control period immediately before such control 
period.
    (4) The permitting authority will review each CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
Ozone Season allowance allocation request under paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section and will allocate CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances 
for each control period pursuant to such request as follows:
    (i) The permitting authority will accept an allowance allocation 
request only if the request meets, or is adjusted by the permitting 
authority as necessary to meet, the requirements of paragraphs (c)(2) 
and (3) of this section.
    (ii) On or after February 1 before the control period, the 
permitting authority will determine the sum of the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
Ozone Season allowances requested (as adjusted under paragraph (c)(4)(i) 
of this section) in all allowance allocation requests accepted under 
paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section for the control period.
    (iii) If the amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances 
in the new unit set-aside for the control period is greater than or 
equal to the sum under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, then the 
permitting authority will allocate the amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
Ozone Season allowances requested (as adjusted under paragraph (c)(4)(i) 
of this section) to each CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season unit covered 
by an allowance allocation request accepted under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of 
this section.
    (iv) If the amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances in 
the new unit set-aside for the control period is less than the sum under 
paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, then the permitting authority will 
allocate to each CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season unit covered by an 
allowance allocation request accepted under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this 
section the amount of the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances 
requested (as adjusted under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section), 
multiplied by the amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances 
in the new unit set-aside for the control period, divided by the sum 
determined

[[Page 149]]

under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, and rounded to the nearest 
whole allowance as appropriate.
    (v) The permitting authority will notify each CAIR designated 
representative that submitted an allowance allocation request of the 
amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances (if any) allocated 
for the control period to the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season unit 
covered by the request.
    (d) If, after completion of the procedures under paragraph (c)(4) of 
this section for a control period, any unallocated CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
Ozone Season allowances remain in the new unit set-aside for the control 
period, the permitting authority will allocate to each CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season unit that was allocated CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
Ozone Season allowances under paragraph (b) of this section an amount of 
CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances equal to the total amount of 
such remaining unallocated CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances, 
multiplied by the unit's allocation under paragraph (b) of this section, 
divided by 95 percent for a control period during 2009 through 2014, and 
97 percent for a control period during 2015 and thereafter, of the 
amount of tons of NO<INF>X</INF> emissions in the State trading budget 
under Sec. 96.340, and rounded to the nearest whole allowance as 
appropriate.

[[Page 158]]

    (b) The recertification provisions of this section shall apply to a 
monitoring system under Sec. 96.370(a)(1) exempt from initial 
certification requirements under paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) If the Administrator has previously approved a petition under 
Sec. 75.17(a) or (b) of this chapter for apportioning the 
NO<INF>X</INF> emission rate measured in a common stack or a petition 
under Sec. 75.66 of this chapter for an alternative to a requirement in 
Sec. 75.12 or Sec. 75.17 of this chapter, the CAIR designated 
representative shall resubmit the petition to the Administrator under 
Sec. 96.375(a) to determine whether the approval applies under the CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season Trading Program.
    (d) Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, the owner 
or operator of a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season unit shall comply with 
the following initial certification and recertification procedures for a 
continuous monitoring system (i.e., a continuous emission monitoring 
system and an excepted monitoring system under appendices D and E to 
part 75 of this chapter) under Sec. 96.370(a)(1). The owner or operator 
of a unit that qualifies to use the low mass emissions excepted 
monitoring methodology under Sec. 75.19 of this chapter or that 
qualifies to use an alternative monitoring system under subpart E of 
part 75 of this chapter shall comply with the procedures in paragraph 
(e) or (f) of this section respectively.
    (1) Requirements for initial certification. The owner or operator 
shall ensure that each continuous monitoring system under Sec. 
96.370(a)(1)(including the automated data acquisition and handling 
system) successfully completes all of the initial certification testing 
required under Sec. 75.20 of this chapter by the applicable deadline in 
Sec. 96.370(b). In addition, whenever the owner or operator installs a 
monitoring system to meet the requirements of this subpart in a location 
where no such monitoring system was previously installed, initial 
certification in accordance with Sec. 75.20 of this chapter is 
required.
    (2) Requirements for recertification. Whenever the owner or operator 
makes a replacement, modification, or change in any certified continuous 
emission monitoring system under Sec. 96.370(a)(1) that may 
significantly affect the ability of the system to accurately measure or 
record NO<INF>X</INF> mass emissions or heat input rate or to meet the 
quality-assurance and quality-control requirements of Sec. 75.21 of 
this chapter or appendix B to part 75 of this chapter, the owner or 
operator shall recertify the monitoring system in accordance with Sec. 
75.20(b) of this chapter. Furthermore, whenever the owner or operator 
makes a replacement, modification, or change to the flue gas handling 
system or the unit's operation that may significantly change the stack 
flow or concentration profile, the owner or operator shall recertify 
each continuous emission monitoring system whose accuracy is potentially 
affected by the change, in accordance with Sec. 75.20(b) of this 
chapter. Examples of changes to a continuous emission monitoring system 
that require recertification include: replacement of the analyzer, 
complete replacement of an existing continuous emission monitoring 
system, or change in location or orientation of the sampling probe or 
site. Any fuel flowmeter systems, and any excepted NO<INF>X</INF> 
monitoring system under appendix E to part 75 of this chapter, under 
Sec. 96.370(a)(1) are subject to the recertification requirements in 
Sec. 75.20(g)(6) of this chapter.
    (3) Approval process for initial certification and recertification. 
Paragraphs (d)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section apply to both initial 
certification and recertification of a continuous monitoring system 
under Sec. 96.370(a)(1). For recertifications, replace the words 
``certification'' and ``initial certification'' with the word 
``recertification'', replace the word ``certified'' with the word 
``recertified,'' and follow the procedures in Sec. Sec. 75.20(b)(5) and 
(g)(7) of this chapter in lieu of the procedures in paragraph (d)(3)(v) 
of this section.
    (i) Notification of certification. The CAIR designated 
representative shall submit to the permitting authority, the appropriate 
EPA Regional Office, and the Administrator written notice of the dates 
of certification testing, in accordance with Sec. 96.373.
    (ii) Certification application. The CAIR designated representative 
shall submit to the permitting authority a certification application for 
each monitoring

[[Page 159]]

system. A complete certification application shall include the 
information specified in Sec. 75.63 of this chapter.
    (iii) Provisional certification date. The provisional certification 
date for a monitoring system shall be determined in accordance with 
Sec. 75.20(a)(3) of this chapter. A provisionally certified monitoring 
system may be used under the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season Trading 
Program for a period not to exceed 120 days after receipt by the 
permitting authority of the complete certification application for the 
monitoring system under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section. Data 
measured and recorded by the provisionally certified monitoring system, 
in accordance with the requirements of part 75 of this chapter, will be 
considered valid quality-assured data (retroactive to the date and time 
of provisional certification), provided that the permitting authority 
does not invalidate the provisional certification by issuing a notice of 
disapproval within 120 days of the date of receipt of the complete 
certification application by the permitting authority.
    (iv) Certification application approval process. The permitting 
authority will issue a written notice of approval or disapproval of the 
certification application to the owner or operator within 120 days of 
receipt of the complete certification application under paragraph 
(d)(3)(ii) of this section. In the event the permitting authority does 
not issue such a notice within such 120-day period, each monitoring 
system that meets the applicable performance requirements of part 75 of 
this chapter and is included in the certification application will be 
deemed certified for use under the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season 
Trading Program.
    (A) Approval notice. If the certification application is complete 
and shows that each monitoring system meets the applicable performance 
requirements of part 75 of this chapter, then the permitting authority 
will issue a written notice of approval of the certification application 
within 120 days of receipt.
    (B) Incomplete application notice. If the certification application 
is not complete, then the permitting authority will issue a written 
notice of incompleteness that sets a reasonable date by which the CAIR 
designated representative must submit the additional information 
required to complete the certification application. If the CAIR 
designated representative does not comply with the notice of 
incompleteness by the specified date, then the permitting authority may 
issue a notice of disapproval under paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(C) of this 
section. The 120-day review period shall not begin before receipt of a 
complete certification application.
    (C) Disapproval notice. If the certification application shows that 
any monitoring system does not meet the performance requirements of part 
75 of this chapter or if the certification application is incomplete and 
the requirement for disapproval under paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(B) of this 
section is met, then the permitting authority will issue a written 
notice of disapproval of the certification application. Upon issuance of 
such notice of disapproval, the provisional certification is invalidated 
by the permitting authority and the data measured and recorded by each 
uncertified monitoring system shall not be considered valid quality-
assured data beginning with the date and hour of provisional 
certification (as defined under Sec. 75.20(a)(3) of this chapter). The 
owner or operator shall follow the procedures for loss of certification 
in paragraph (d)(3)(v) of this section for each monitoring system that 
is disapproved for initial certification.
    (D) Audit decertification. The permitting authority or, for a CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-in unit or a unit for which a CAIR opt-
in permit application is submitted and not withdrawn and a CAIR opt-in 
permit is not yet issued or denied under subpart IIII of this part, the 
Administrator may issue a notice of disapproval of the certification 
status of a monitor in accordance with Sec. 96.372(b).
    (v) Procedures for loss of certification. If the permitting 
authority or the Administrator issues a notice of disapproval of a 
certification application under paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(C) of this section 
or a notice of disapproval of certification status under paragraph 
(d)(3)(iv)(D) of this section, then:

Sec. 96.384  Opt-in process.

    The permitting authority will issue or deny a CAIR opt-in permit for 
a unit for which an initial application for a CAIR opt-in permit under 
Sec. 96.383 is submitted in accordance with the following:
    (a) Interim review of monitoring plan. The permitting authority and 
the Administrator will determine, on an interim basis, the sufficiency 
of the monitoring plan accompanying the initial application for a CAIR 
opt-in permit under Sec. 96.383. A monitoring plan is sufficient, for 
purposes of interim review, if the plan appears to contain information 
demonstrating that the NO<INF>X</INF> emissions rate and heat input of 
the unit and all other applicable parameters are monitored and reported 
in accordance with subpart HHHH of this part. A determination of 
sufficiency shall not be construed as acceptance or approval of the 
monitoring plan.
    (b) Monitoring and reporting. (1)(i) If the permitting authority and 
the Administrator determine that the monitoring plan is sufficient under 
paragraph (a) of this section, the owner or operator shall monitor and 
report the NO<INF>X</INF> emissions rate and the heat input of the unit 
and all other applicable parameters, in accordance with subpart HHHH of 
this part, starting on the date of certification of the appropriate 
monitoring systems under subpart HHHH of this part and continuing until 
a CAIR opt-in permit is denied under Sec. 96.384(f) or, if a CAIR opt-
in permit is issued, the date and time when the unit is withdrawn from 
the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season Trading Program in accordance with 
Sec. 96.386.

[[Page 165]]

    (ii) The monitoring and reporting under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this 
section shall include the entire control period immediately before the 
date on which the unit enters the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season 
Trading Program under Sec. 96.384(g), during which period monitoring 
system availability must not be less than 90 percent under subpart HHHH 
of this part and the unit must be in full compliance with any applicable 
State or Federal emissions or emissions-related requirements.
    (2) To the extent the NO<INF>X</INF> emissions rate and the heat 
input of the unit are monitored and reported in accordance with subpart 
HHHH of this part for one or more control periods, in addition to the 
control period under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, during which 
control periods monitoring system availability is not less than 90 
percent under subpart HHHH of this part and the unit is in full 
compliance with any applicable State or Federal emissions or emissions-
related requirements and which control periods begin not more than 3 
years before the unit enters the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season 
Trading Program under Sec. 96.384(g), such information shall be used as 
provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.
    (c) Baseline heat input. The unit's baseline heat input shall equal:
    (1) If the unit's NO<INF>X</INF> emissions rate and heat input are 
monitored and reported for only one control period, in accordance with 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the unit's total heat input (in mmBtu) 
for the control period; or
    (2) If the unit's NO<INF>X</INF> emissions rate and heat input are 
monitored and reported for more than one control period, in accordance 
with paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, the average of the 
amounts of the unit's total heat input (in mmBtu) for the control 
periods under paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) and (2) of this section.
    (d) Baseline NO<INF>X</INF> emission rate. The unit's baseline 
NO<INF>X</INF> emission rate shall equal:
    (1) If the unit's NO<INF>X</INF> emissions rate and heat input are 
monitored and reported for only one control period, in accordance with 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the unit's NO<INF>X</INF> emissions 
rate (in lb/mmBtu) for the control period;
    (2) If the unit's NO<INF>X</INF> emissions rate and heat input are 
monitored and reported for more than one control period, in accordance 
with paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, and the unit does not 
have add-on NO<INF>X</INF> emission controls during any such control 
periods, the average of the amounts of the unit's NO<INF>X</INF> 
emissions rate (in lb/mmBtu) for the control periods under paragraphs 
(b)(1)(ii) and (2) of this section; or
    (3) If the unit's NO<INF>X</INF> emissions rate and heat input are 
monitored and reported for more than one control period, in accordance 
with paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, and the unit has add-on 
NO<INF>X</INF> emission controls during any such control periods, the 
average of the amounts of the unit's NO<INF>X</INF> emissions rate (in 
lb/mmBtu) for such control periods during which the unit has add-on 
NO<INF>X</INF> emission controls.
    (e) Issuance of CAIR opt-in permit. After calculating the baseline 
heat input and the baseline NO<INF>X</INF> emissions rate for the unit 
under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section and if the permitting 
authority determines that the CAIR designated representative shows that 
the unit meets the requirements for a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season 
opt-in unit in Sec. 96.380 and meets the elements certified in Sec. 
96.383(a)(2), the permitting authority will issue a CAIR opt-in permit. 
The permitting authority will provide a copy of the CAIR opt-in permit 
to the Administrator, who will then establish a compliance account for 
the source that includes the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-in 
unit unless the source already has a compliance account.
    (f) Issuance of denial of CAIR opt-in permit. Notwithstanding 
paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section, if at any time before 
issuance of a CAIR opt-in permit for the unit, the permitting authority 
determines that the CAIR designated representative fails to show that 
the unit meets the requirements for a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season 
opt-in unit in Sec. 96.380 or meets the elements certified in Sec. 
96.383(a)(2), the permitting authority will issue a denial of a CAIR 
opt-in permit for the unit.
    (g) Date of entry into CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season Trading 
Program. A unit for which an initial CAIR opt-in permit is

[[Page 166]]

issued by the permitting authority shall become a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
Ozone Season opt-in unit, and a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season unit, 
as of the later of May 1, 2009 or May 1 of the first control period 
during which such CAIR opt-in permit is issued.
    (h) Repowered CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-in unit. (1) If 
CAIR designated representative requests, and the permitting authority 
issues a CAIR opt-in permit providing for, allocation to a CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-in unit of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone 
Season allowances under Sec. 96.388(c) and such unit is repowered after 
its date of entry into the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season Trading 
Program under paragraph (g) of this section, the repowered unit shall be 
treated as a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-in unit replacing the 
original CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-in unit, as of the date of 
start-up of the repowered unit's combustion chamber.
    (2) Notwithstanding paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, as of 
the date of start-up under paragraph (h)(1) of this section, the 
repowered unit shall be deemed to have the same date of commencement of 
operation, date of commencement of commercial operation, baseline heat 
input, and baseline NO<INF>X</INF> emission rate as the original CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-in unit, and the original CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-in unit shall no longer be treated as a 
CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-in unit or a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
Ozone Season unit.

Sec. 96.386  Withdrawal from CAIR NOX Ozone Season Trading Program.

    Except as provided under paragraph (g) of this section, a CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-in unit may withdraw from the CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season Trading Program, but only if the permitting 
authority issues a notification to the CAIR designated representative of 
the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-in unit of the acceptance of 
the withdrawal of the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-in unit in 
accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.
    (a) Requesting withdrawal. In order to withdraw a CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-on unit from the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
Ozone Season Trading Program, the CAIR designated representative of the 
CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-in unit shall submit to the 
permitting authority a request to withdraw effective as of midnight of 
September 30 of a specified calendar year, which date must be at least 4 
years after September 30 of the year of entry into the CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season Trading Program under

[[Page 167]]

Sec. 96.384(g). The request must be submitted no later than 90 days 
before the requested effective date of withdrawal.
    (b) Conditions for withdrawal. Before a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone 
Season opt-in unit covered by a request under paragraph (a) of this 
section may withdraw from the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season Trading 
Program and the CAIR opt-in permit may be terminated under paragraph (e) 
of this section, the following conditions must be met:
    (1) For the control period ending on the date on which the 
withdrawal is to be effective, the source that includes the CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-in unit must meet the requirement to 
hold CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances under Sec. 96.306(c) 
and cannot have any excess emissions.
    (2) After the requirement for withdrawal under paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section is met, the Administrator will deduct from the compliance 
account of the source that includes the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season 
opt-in unit CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances equal in amount 
to and allocated for the same or a prior control period as any CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances allocated to the CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-in unit under Sec. 96.388 for any 
control period for which the withdrawal is to be effective. If there are 
no remaining CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season units at the source, the 
Administrator will close the compliance account, and the owners and 
operators of the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-in unit may submit 
a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowance transfer for any remaining 
CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances to another CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season Allowance Tracking System in accordance with 
subpart GGGG of this part.
    (c) Notification. (1) After the requirements for withdrawal under 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section are met (including deduction of 
the full amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances 
required), the permitting authority will issue a notification to the 
CAIR designated representative of the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season 
opt-in unit of the acceptance of the withdrawal of the CAIR

of the calendar year for which the withdrawal was requested.
    (2) If the requirements for withdrawal under paragraphs (a) and (b) 
of this section are not met, the permitting authority will issue a 
notification to the CAIR designated representative of the CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-in unit that the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
Ozone Season opt-in unit's request to withdraw is denied. Such CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-in unit shall continue to be a CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-in unit.
    (d) Permit amendment. After the permitting authority issues a 
notification under paragraph (c)(1) of this section that the 
requirements for withdrawal have been met, the permitting authority will 
revise the CAIR permit covering the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season 
opt-in unit to terminate the CAIR opt-in permit for such unit as of the 
effective date specified under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The 
unit shall continue to be a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-in unit 
until the effective date of the termination and shall comply with all 
requirements under the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season Trading Program 
concerning any control periods for which the unit is a CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-in unit, even if such requirements arise 
or must be complied with after the withdrawal takes effect.
    (e) Reapplication upon failure to meet conditions of withdrawal. If 
the permitting authority denies the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season 
opt-in unit's request to withdraw, the CAIR designated representative 
may submit another request to withdraw in accordance with paragraphs (a) 
and (b) of this section.
    (f) Ability to reapply to the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season 
Trading Program. Once a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-in unit 
withdraws from the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season Trading Program and 
its CAIR opt-in permit is terminated under this section, the CAIR 
designated representative may not submit another application for a CAIR 
opt-in permit under Sec. 96.383 for such CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone 
Season opt-in unit before the date that is 4 years after the date on 
which the withdrawal became effective. Such new application for a CAIR 
opt-in permit will be treated as an initial application for a CAIR opt-
in permit under Sec. 96.384.
    (g) Inability to withdraw. Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) through 
(f) of this section, a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season

[[Page 168]]

opt-in unit shall not be eligible to withdraw from the CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season Trading Program if the CAIR designated 
representative of the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-in unit 
requests, and the permitting authority issues a CAIR opt-in permit 
providing for, allocation to the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-in 
unit of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances under Sec. 
96.388(c).

    (iii) The permitting authority will allocate CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
Ozone Season allowances to the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-in 
unit in an amount equaling the heat input under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of 
this section, multiplied by the NO<INF>X</INF> emission rate under 
paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, divided by 2,000 lb/ton, and 
rounded to the nearest whole allowance as appropriate.
    (d) Recordation. (1) The Administrator will record, in the 
compliance account of the source that includes the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
Ozone Season opt-in unit, the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season 
allowances allocated by the permitting authority to the CAIR

97.2, Sec. 97.3, Sec. 97.4(a), Sec. 97.7, and subparts E, F, and G of 
this part. The NO<INF>X</INF> emission limitation under this paragraph 
(b)(1) shall restrict NO<INF>X</INF> emissions during the control period 
by limiting unit operating hours. The restriction on unit operating 
hours shall be calculated by dividing 25 tons by the unit's maximum 
potential hourly NO<INF>X</INF> mass emissions, which shall equal the 
unit's maximum rated hourly heat input multiplied by the highest default 
NO<INF>X</INF> emission rate otherwise applicable to the unit under 
Sec. 75.19 of this chapter.
    (2) The exemption under paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall 
become effective as follows:
    (i) The exemption shall become effective on the date on which the 
NO<INF>X</INF> emission limitation and the special provisions in the 
permit under paragraph (b)(1) of this section become final; or
    (ii) If the NO<INF>X</INF> emission limitation and the special 
provisions in the permit under paragraph (b)(1) of this section become 
final during a control period and after the first date on which the unit 
operates during such control period, then the exemption shall become 
effective on May 1 of such control period, provided that such 
NO<INF>X</INF> emission limitation and the special provisions apply to 
the unit as of such first date of operation. If such NO<INF>X</INF> 
emission limitation and special provisions do not apply to the unit as 
of such first date of operation, then the exemption under paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section shall become effective on October 1 of the year 
during which such NO<INF>X</INF> emission limitation and the special 
provisions become final.
    (3) The permitting authority that issues a federally enforceable 
permit under paragraph (b)(1) of this section for a unit under paragraph 
(a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section will provide the Administrator written 
notice of the issuance of such permit and, upon request, a copy of the 
permit.
    (4) Special provisions. (i) A unit exempt under paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section shall comply with the restriction on fuel use and unit 
operating hours described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section during the 
control period in each year.
    (ii) The Administrator will allocate NO<INF>X</INF> allowances to 
the unit under Sec. Sec. 97.41(a) through (c) and 97.42(a) through (c). 
For each control period for which the unit is allocated NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances under Sec. Sec. 97.41(a) through (c) and 97.42(a) through 
(c):
    (A) The owners and operators of the unit must specify a general 
account, in which the Administrator will record the NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances; and
    (B) After the Administrator records a NO<INF>X</INF> allowance 
allocations under Sec. Sec. 97.41(a) through (c) and 97.42(a) through 
(c), the Administrator will deduct, from the general account under 
paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) of this section, NO<INF>X</INF> allowances that 
are allocated for the same or a prior control period as the 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances allocated to the unit under Sec. Sec. 
97.41(a) through (c) and 97.42(a) through (c) and that equal the 
NO<INF>X</INF> emission limitation (in tons of NO<INF>X</INF>) on which 
the unit's exemption under paragraph (b)(1) of this section is

[[Page 182]]

based. The NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account representative shall ensure 
that such general account contains the NO<INF>X</INF> allowances 
necessary for completion of such deduction.
    (iii) A unit exempt under this paragraph (b) shall report hours of 
unit operation during the control period in each year to the permitting 
authority by November 1 of that year.
    (iv) For a period of 5 years from the date the records are created, 
the owners and operators of a unit exempt under paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section shall retain, at the source that includes the unit, records 
demonstrating that the conditions of the federally enforceable permit 
under paragraph (b)(1) of this section were met, including the 
restriction on fuel use or unit operating hours. The 5-year period for 
keeping records may be extended for cause, at any time prior to the end 
of the period, in writing by the permitting authority or the 
Administrator. The owners and operators bear the burden of proof that 
the unit met the restriction on fuel use or unit operating hours.
    (v) The owners and operators and, to the extent applicable, the 
NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account representative of a unit exempt under 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall comply with the requirements of 
the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget Trading Program concerning all periods for 
which the exemption is not in effect, even if such requirements arise, 
or must be complied with, after the exemption takes effect.
    (vi) On the earlier of the following dates, a unit exempt under 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall lose its exemption:
    (A) The date on which the restriction on fuel use or unit operating 
hours described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is removed from the 
unit's federally enforceable permit or otherwise becomes no longer 
applicable to any control period starting in 2004; or
    (B) The first date on which the unit fails to comply, or with regard 
to which the owners and operators fail to meet their burden of proving 
that the unit is complying, with the restriction on fuel use or unit 
operating hours described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section during any 
control period starting in 2004.
    (vii) A unit that loses its exemption in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(4)(vi) of this section shall be subject to the requirements of this 
part. For the purpose of applying permitting requirements under subpart 
C of this part, allocating allowances under subpart E of this part, and 
applying monitoring requirements under subpart H of this part, the unit 
shall be treated as commencing operation and, if the unit is covered by 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section, commencing commercial operation on the 
date the unit loses its exemption.
    (viii) A unit that is exempt under paragraph (b)(1) of this section 
is not eligible to be a NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in unit under subpart 
I of this part.

account representative of one NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit shall not be 
liable for any violation by any other NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit of 
which they are not owners or operators or the NO<INF>X</INF> authorized 
account representative and that is located at a source of which they are 
not owners or operators or the NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account 
representative.
    (g) Effect on other authorities. No provision of the NO<INF>X</INF> 
Budget Trading Program, a NO<INF>X</INF> Budget permit application, a 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget permit, or an exemption under Sec. 97.4(b) or 
Sec. 97.5 shall be construed as exempting or excluding the owners and 
operators and, to the extent applicable, the NO<INF>X</INF> authorized 
account representative of a NO<INF>X</INF> Budget source or 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit from compliance with any other provision of

Sec. 97.42  NOX allowance allocations.

    (a)(1) The heat input (in mmBtu) used for calculating NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowance allocations for each NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit under Sec. 
97.4(a) will be:
    (i) For a NO<INF>X</INF> allowance allocation under Sec. 97.41(a):
    (A) For a unit under Sec. 97.4(a)(1), the average of the two 
highest amounts of the unit's heat input for the control periods in 1995 
through 1998; or
    (B) For a unit under Sec. 97.4(a)(2), the control period in 1995 
or, if the Administrator determines that reasonably reliable data are 
available for control periods in 1996 through 1998, the average of the 
two highest amounts of the unit's heat input for the control periods in 
1995 through 1998.
    (ii) For a NO<INF>X</INF> allowance allocation under Sec. 97.41(b), 
the unit's average heat input for the control periods in 2002 through 
2004.
    (iii) For a NO<INF>X</INF> allowance allocation under Sec. 
97.41(c), the unit's average heat input for the control period in the 
years that are 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 years before the first year for which 
the allocation is being calculated.
    (2) The unit's heat input for the control period in each year 
specified under paragraph (a)(1) of this section will be determined in 
accordance with part 75 of this chapter. Notwithstanding the first 
sentence of this paragraph (a)(2):
    (i) For a NO<INF>X</INF> allowance allocation under Sec. 97.41(a), 
such heat input will be determined using the best available data 
reported to the Administrator for the unit if the unit was not otherwise 
subject to the requirements of part 75 of this chapter for the control 
period.
    (ii) For a NO<INF>X</INF> allowance allocation under Sec. 97.41(b) 
or (c) for a unit exempt under Sec. 97.4(b), such heat input shall be 
treated as zero if the unit is exempt under Sec. 97.4(b) during the 
control period.
    (b) For each group of control periods specified in Sec. 97.41(a) 
through (c), the Administrator will allocate to all NO<INF>X</INF> 
Budget units in a given State under Sec. 97.4(a)(1) that commenced 
operation before May 1, 1997 for allocations under Sec. 97.41(a), May 
1, 2003 for allocations under Sec. 97.41(b), and May 1 of the year 5 
years before the first year for which the allocation under Sec. 
97.41(c) is being calculated, a total number of NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances equal to 95 percent of the portion of the State's trading 
program budget under Sec. 97.40 covering such units. The Administrator 
will allocate in accordance with the following procedures:
    (1) The Administrator will allocate NO<INF>X</INF> allowances to 
each NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit under Sec. 97.4(a)(1) for each control 
period in an amount equaling 0.15 lb/mmBtu multiplied by the heat input 
determined under paragraph (a) of this section, divided by 2,000 lb/ton, 
and rounded to the nearest whole number of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances as 
appropriate.
    (2) If the initial total number of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances 
allocated to all NO<INF>X</INF> Budget units under Sec. 97.4(a)(1) in 
the State for a control period under paragraph (b)(1) of this section 
does not equal 95 percent of the portion of the State's trading program 
budget under Sec. 97.40 covering such units, the Administrator will 
adjust the total number of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances allocated to all 
such NO<INF>X</INF> Budget units for the control period under paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section so that the total number of NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances allocated equals 95 percent of such portion of the State's 
trading program budget. This adjustment will be made by: multiplying 
each unit's allocation by 95 percent of such portion of the State's 
trading program budget; dividing by the total number of NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances allocated under paragraph (b)(1) of this section for the 
control period; and rounding to the nearest whole number of 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances as appropriate.
    (c) For each group of control periods specified in Sec. 97.41(a) 
through (c), the Administrator will allocate to all NO<INF>X</INF> 
Budget units in a given State under Sec. 97.4(a)(2) that commenced 
operation before May 1, 1997 for allocations under Sec. 97.41(a), May 
1, 2003 for allocations under Sec. 97.41(b), and May 1 of the year 5 
years before the first year for which the allocation under Sec. 
97.41(c) is being calculated, a total number of NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances equal to 95 percent of the portion of the State's trading 
program budget under Sec. 97.40 covering such units. The Administrator 
will allocate in accordance with the following procedures:
    (1) The Administrator will allocate NO<INF>X</INF> allowances to 
each NO<INF>X</INF> Budget

[[Page 193]]

unit under Sec. 97.4(a)(2) for each control period in an amount 
equaling 0.17 lb/mmBtu multiplied by the heat input determined under 
paragraph (a) of this section, divided by 2,000 lb/ton, and rounded to 
the nearest whole number of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances as appropriate.
    (2) If the initial total number of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances 
allocated to all NO<INF>X</INF> Budget units under Sec. 97.4(a)(2) in 
the State for a control period under paragraph (c)(1) of this section 
does not equal 95 percent of the portion of the State's trading program 
budget under Sec. 97.40 covering such units, the Administrator will 
adjust the total number of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances allocated to all 
such NO<INF>X</INF> Budget units for the control period under paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section so that the total number of NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances allocated equals 95 percent of the portion of the State's 
trading program budget under Sec. 97.40 covering such units. This 
adjustment will be made by: multiplying each unit's allocation by 95 
percent of the portion of the State's trading program budget under Sec. 
97.40 covering such units; dividing by the total number of 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances allocated under paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section for the control period; and rounding to the nearest whole number 
of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances as appropriate.
    (d) For each control period specified in Sec. 97.41(d), the 
Administrator will allocate NO<INF>X</INF> allowances to NO<INF>X</INF> 
Budget units in a given State under Sec. 97.4(a) (except for units 
exempt under Sec. 97.4(b)) that commence operation, or are projected to 
commence operation, on or after: May 1, 1997 (for control periods under 
Sec. 97.41(a)); May 1, 2003, (for control periods under Sec. 
97.41(b)); and May 1 of the year 5 years before the beginning of the 
group of 5 years that includes the control period (for control periods 
under Sec. 97.41(c)). The Administrator will make the allocations under 
this paragraph (d) in accordance with the following procedures:
    (1) The Administrator will establish one allocation set-aside for 
each control period. Each allocation set-aside will be allocated 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances equal to 5 percent of the tons of 
NO<INF>X</INF> emission in the State's trading program budget under 
Sec. 97.40, rounded to the nearest whole number of NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances as appropriate.
    (2) The NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account representative of a 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit specified in this paragraph (d) may submit to 
the Administrator a request, in a format specified by the Administrator, 
to be allocated NO<INF>X</INF> allowances for the control period. The 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowance allocation request must be received by the 
Administrator on or after the date on which the State permitting 
authority issues a permit to construct the unit and by January 1 before 
the control period for which NO<INF>X</INF> allowances are requested.
    (3) In a NO<INF>X</INF> allowance allocation request under paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section, the NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account 
representative for a NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit under Sec. 97.4(a)(1) 
may request for the control period NO<INF>X</INF> allowances in an 
amount that does not exceed the lesser of:
    (i) 0.15 lb/mmBtu multiplied by the unit's maximum design heat 
input, multiplied by the lesser of 3,672 hours or the number of hours 
remaining in the control period starting with the day in the control 
period on which the unit commences operation or is projected to commence 
operation, divided by 2,000 lb/ton, and rounded to the nearest whole 
number of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances as appropriate; or
    (ii) The unit's most stringent State or Federal NO<INF>X</INF> 
emission limitation multiplied by the unit's maximum design heat input, 
multiplied by the lesser of 3,672 hours or the number of hours remaining 
in the control period starting with the day in the control period on 
which the unit commences operation or is projected to commence 
operation, divided by 2,000 lb/ton, and rounded to the nearest whole 
number of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances as appropriate.
    (4) In a NO<INF>X</INF> allowance allocation request under paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section, the NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account 
representative for a NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit under Sec. 97.4(a)(2) 
may request for the control period NO<INF>X</INF> allowances in an 
amount that does not exceed the lesser of:
    (i) 0.17 lb/mmBtu multiplied by the unit's maximum design heat 
input, multiplied by the lesser of 3,672 hours or the number of hours 
remaining in the control period starting with the day in the control 
period on which the

[[Page 194]]

unit commences operation or is projected to commence operation, divided 
by 2,000 lb/ton, and rounded to the nearest whole number of 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances as appropriate; or
    (ii) The unit's most stringent State or Federal NO<INF>X</INF> 
emission limitation multiplied by the unit's maximum design heat input, 
multiplied by the lesser of 3,672 hours or the number of hours remaining 
in the control period starting with the day in the control period on 
which the unit commences operation or is projected to commence 
operation, divided by 2,000 lb/ton, and rounded to the nearest whole 
number of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances as appropriate.
    (5) The Administrator will review each NO<INF>X</INF> allowance 
allocation request submitted in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section and will allocate NO<INF>X</INF> allowances pursuant to such 
request as follows:
    (i) Upon receipt of the NO<INF>X</INF> allowance allocation request, 
the Administrator will make any necessary adjustments to the request to 
ensure that the requirements of paragraphs (d) introductory text, 
(d)(2), (d)(3), and (d)(4) are met.
    (ii) The Administrator will determine the following amounts:
    (A) The sum of the NO<INF>X</INF> allowances requested (as adjusted 
under paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section) in all NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowance allocation requests under paragraph (d)(2) of this section for 
the control period; and
    (B) For units exempt under Sec. 97.4(b) in the State that commenced 
operation, or are projected to commence operation, on or after May 1, 
1997 (for control periods under Sec. 97.41(a)); May 1, 2003, (for 
control periods under Sec. 97.41(b)); and May 1 of the year 5 years 
before beginning of the group of 5 years that includes the control 
period (for control periods under Sec. 97.41(c)), the sum of the 
NO<INF>X</INF> emission limitations (in tons of NO<INF>X</INF>) on which 
each unit's exemption under Sec. 97.4(b) is based.
    (iii) If the number of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances in the allocation 
set-aside for the control period less the amount under paragraph 
(d)(5)(ii)(B) of this section is not less than the amount determined 
under paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(A) of this section, the Administrator will 
allocate the amount of the NO<INF>X</INF> allowances requested (as 
adjusted under paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section) to the 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit for which the allocation request was 
submitted.
    (iv) If the number of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances in the allocation 
set-aside for the control period less the amount under paragraph 
(d)(5)(ii)(B) of this section is less than the amount determined under 
paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(A) of this section, the Administrator will 
allocate, to the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit for which the allocation 
request was submitted, the amount of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances requested 
(as adjusted under paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section) multiplied by 
the number of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances in the allocation set-aside for 
the control period less the amount determined under paragraph 
(d)(5)(ii)(B) of this section, divided by the amount determined under 
paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(A) of this section, and rounded to the nearest 
whole number of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances as appropriate.
    (e)(1) For a NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit that is allocated 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances under paragraph (d) of this section for a 
control period, the Administrator will deduct NO<INF>X</INF> allowances 
under Sec. 97.54(b), (e), or (f) to account for the actual heat input 
of the unit during the control period. The Administrator will calculate 
the number of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances to be deducted to account for 
the unit's actual heat input using the following formulas and rounding 
to the nearest whole number of NO<INF>X</INF> allowance as appropriate, 
provided that the number of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances to be deducted 
shall be zero if the number calculated is less than zero:

NO<INF>X</INF> allowances deducted for actual heat input for a unit 
    under Sec. 97.4(a)(1) = Unit's NO<INF>X</INF> allowances allocated 
    for control period-(Unit's actual control period heat inputx the 
    lesser of 0.15 lb/mmBtu the unit's most stringent State or Federal 
    emission limitation x 2,000 lb/ton); and NO<INF>X</INF> allowances 
    deducted for actual heat input for a unit under Sec. 97.4(a)(2) = 
    Unit's NO<INF>X</INF> allowances allocated for control period-
    (Unit's actual control period heat input x the lesser of 0.17 lb/
    mmBtu the unit's most stringent State or Federal emission limitation 
    x 2,000 lb/ton)

Where:


[[Page 195]]


``Unit's NO<INF>X</INF> allowances allocated for control period'' is the 
number of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances allocated to the unit for the 
control period under paragraph (d) of this section; and
``Unit's actual control period heat input'' is the heat input (in mmBtu) 
of the unit during the control period.

    (2) The Administrator will transfer any NO<INF>X</INF> allowances 
deducted under paragraph (e)(1) of this section to the allocation set-
aside for the control period for which they were allocated.
    (f) After making the deductions for compliance under Sec. 97.54(b), 
(e), or (f) for a control period, the Administrator will determine 
whether any NO<INF>X</INF> allowances remain in the allocation set-aside 
for the control period. The Administrator will allocate any such 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances to the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget units in the 
State using the following formula and rounding to the nearest whole 
number of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances as appropriate:

Unit's share of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances remaining in allocation set-
    aside = Total NO<INF>X</INF> allowances remaining in allocation set-
    aside x (Unit's NO<INF>X</INF> allowance allocation / State's 
    trading program budget excluding allocation set-aside)

Where:

``Total NO<INF>X</INF> allowances remaining in allocation set-aside'' is 
the total number of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances remaining in the 
allocation set-aside for the control period;
``Unit's NO<INF>X</INF> allowance allocation'' is the number of 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances allocated under paragraph (b) or (c) of this 
section to the unit for the control period to which the allocation set-
aside applies; and
``State's trading program budget excluding allocation set-aside'' is the 
State's trading program budget under Sec. 97.40 for the control period 
to which the allocation set-aside applies multiplied by 95 percent, 
rounded to the nearest whole number of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances as 
appropriate.

    (g) If the Administrator determines that NO<INF>X</INF> allowances 
were allocated under paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of this section for a 
control period and the recipient of the allocation is not actually a 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit under Sec. 97.4(a), the Administrator will 
notify the NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account representative and then 
will act in accordance with the following procedures:
    (1)(i) The Administrator will not record such NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances for the control period in an account under Sec. 97.53;
    (ii) If the Administrator already recorded such NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances for the control period in an account under Sec. 97.53 and if 
the Administrator makes such determination before making all deductions 
pursuant to Sec. 97.54 (except deductions pursuant to Sec. 
97.54(d)(2)) for the control period, then the Administrator will deduct 
from the account NO<INF>X</INF> allowances equal in number to and 
allocated for the same or a prior control period as the NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances allocated to such recipient for the control period. The 
NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account representative shall ensure that the 
account contains the NO<INF>X</INF> allowances necessary for completion 
of such deduction. If account does not contain the necessary 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances, the Administrator will deduct the required 
number of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances, regardless of the control period 
for which they were allocated, whenever NO<INF>X</INF> allowances are 
recorded in the account; or
    (iii) If the Administrator already recorded such NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances for the control period in an account under Sec. 97.53 and if 
the Administrator makes such determination after making all deductions 
pursuant to Sec. 97.54 (except deductions pursuant to Sec. 
97.54(d)(2)) for the control period, then the Administrator will apply 
paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section to any subsequent control period 
for which NO<INF>X</INF> allowances were allocated to such recipient.
    (2) The Administrator will transfer the NO<INF>X</INF> allowances 
that are not recorded, or that are deducted, pursuant to paragraph 
(g)(1) of this section to an allocation set-aside for the State in which 
such source is located.

Sec. 97.43  Compliance Supplement Pool.

    (a) For any NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit that reduces its 
NO<INF>X</INF> emission rate in the 2001 through 2003 control period, 
the owners and operators may request early reduction credits in 
accordance with the following requirements:
    (1) Each NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit for which the owners and 
operators intend to request, or request, any early reduction credits in 
accordance with paragraph

[[Page 196]]

(a)(4) of this section shall monitor and report NO<INF>X</INF> emissions 
in accordance with subpart H of this part starting in the 2000 control 
period and for each control period for which such early reduction 
credits are requested. The unit's percent monitor data availability 
shall not be less than 90 percent during the 2000 control period, and 
the unit must be in full compliance with any applicable State or Federal 
NO<INF>X</INF> emission control requirements during 2000 through 2002.
    (2) NO<INF>X</INF> emission rate and heat input under paragraphs 
(a)(3) and (4) of this section shall be determined in accordance with 
subpart H of this part.
    (3) Each NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit for which the owners and 
operators intend to request, or request, any early reduction credits 
under paragraph (a)(4) of this section shall reduce its NO<INF>X</INF> 
emission rate, for each control period for which early reduction credits 
are requested, to less than both 0.25 lb/mmBtu and 80 percent of the 
unit's NO<INF>X</INF> emission rate in the 2000 control period.
    (4) The NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account representative of a 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit that meets the requirements of paragraphs (a) 
(1) and (3) of this section may submit to the Administrator a request 
for early reduction credits for the unit based on NO<INF>X</INF> 
emission rate reductions made by the unit in the control period for 2001 
through 2003.
    (i) In the early reduction credit request, the NO<INF>X</INF> 
authorized account may request early reduction credits for such control 
period in an amount equal to the unit's heat input for such control 
period multiplied by the difference between 0.25 lb/mmBtu and the unit's 
NO<INF>X</INF> emission rate for such control period, divided by 2000 
lb/ton, and rounded to the nearest whole number of tons.
    (ii) The early reduction credit request must be submitted, in a 
format specified by the Administrator, by February 1, 2004.
    (b) For any NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit that is subject to the Ozone 
Transport Commission NO<INF>X</INF> Budget Program under title I of the 
Clean Air Act, the owners and operators may request early reduction 
credits in accordance with the following requirements:
    (1) The NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account representative of the unit 
may submit to the Administrator a request for early reduction credits in 
an amount equal to the amount of banked allowances under the Ozone 
Transport Commission NO<INF>X</INF> Budget Program that were allocated 
for the control period in 2001 through 2003 and are held by the unit, in 
accordance with the Ozone Transport Commission NO<INF>X</INF> Budget 
Program, as of the date of submission of the request. During the entire 
control period in 2001 through 2003 for which the allowances were 
allocated, the unit must have monitored and reported NO<INF>X</INF> 
emissions in accordance with part 75 (except for subpart H) of this 
chapter and the Guidance for Implementation of Emission Monitoring 
Requirements for the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget Program (January 28, 1997).
    (2) The early reduction credit request under paragraph (b)(1) must 
be submitted, in a format specified by the Administrator, by February 1, 
2004.
    (3) The NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account representative of the unit 
shall not submit a request for early reduction credits under paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section for banked allowances under the Ozone Transport 
Commission NO<INF>X</INF> Budget Program that were allocated for any 
control period during which the unit made NO<INF>X</INF> emission 
reductions for which he or she submits a request for early reduction 
credits under paragraph (a) of this section for the unit.
    (c) The Administrator will review each early reduction credit 
request submitted in accordance with paragraph (a) or (b) of this 
section and will allocate NO<INF>X</INF> allowances to NO<INF>X</INF> 
Budget units in a given State and covered by such request as follows:
    (1) Upon receipt of each early reduction credit request, the 
Administrator will make any necessary adjustments to the request to 
ensure that the amount of the early reduction credits requested meets 
the requirements of paragraph (a) or (b) of this section.
    (2) After February 1, 2004, the Administrator will make available to 
the public a statement of the total number of early reduction credits 
requested by NO<INF>X</INF> Budget units in the State.
    (3) If the State's compliance supplement pool set forth in appendix 
D of this part has a number of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances not less than 
the amount of early

[[Page 197]]

reduction credits in all early reduction credit requests under paragraph 
(a) or (b) of this section for 2001 through 2003 (as adjusted under 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section) submitted by February 1, 2004, the 
Administrator will allocate to each NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit covered 
by such requests one allowance for each early reduction credit requested 
(as adjusted under paragraph (c)(1) of this section).
    (4) If the State's compliance supplement pool set forth in appendix 
D of this part has a smaller number of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances than 
the amount of early reduction credits in all early reduction credit 
requests under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section for 2001 through 
2003 (as adjusted under paragraph (c)(1) of this section) submitted by 
February 1, 2004, the Administrator will allocate NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances to each NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit covered by such requests 
according to the following formula and rounding to the nearest whole 
number of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances as appropriate:

Unit's allocation for early reduction credits = Unit's adjusted early 
    reduction credits x (State's compliance supplement pool / Total 
    adjusted early reduction credits for all units)

Where:

``Unit's allocation for early reduction credits'' is the number of 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances allocated to the unit for early reduction 
credits.
``Unit's adjusted early reduction credits'' is the amount of early 
reduction credits requested for the unit for 2001 and 2002 in early 
reduction credit requests under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, as 
adjusted under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
``State's compliance supplement pool'' is the number of NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances in the State's compliance supplement pool set forth in 
appendix D of this part.
``Total adjusted early reduction credits for all units'' is the amount 
of early reduction credits requested for all units for 2001 and 2002 in 
early reduction credit requests under paragraph (a) or (b) of this 
section, as adjusted under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

    (5) By April 1, 2004, the Administrator will determine by order the 
allocations under paragraph (c)(3) or (4) of this section. The 
Administrator will make available to the public each determination of 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowance allocations and will provide an opportunity for 
submission of objections to the determination. Objections shall be 
limited to addressing whether the determination is in accordance with 
paragraph (c)(1), (3), or (4) of this section. Based on any such 
objections, the Administrator will adjust each determination to the 
extent necessary to ensure that it is in accordance with paragraph 
(c)(1), (3), or (4) of this section.
    (6) By May 1, 2004, the Administrator will record the allocations 
under paragraph (c)(3) or (4) of this section.
    (7) NO<INF>X</INF> allowances recorded under paragraph (c)(6) of 
this section may be deducted for compliance under Sec. 97.54 for the 
control period in 2004 or 2005. Notwithstanding Sec. 97.55(a), the 
Administrator will deduct as retired any NO<INF>X</INF> allowance that 
is recorded under paragraph (c)(6) of this section and that is not 
deducted for compliance under Sec. 97.54 for the control period in 2003 
or 2004.

<R05>
Sec. 97.54  Compliance.

    (a) NO<INF>X</INF> allowance transfer deadline. The NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances are available to be deducted for compliance with a unit's 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget emissions limitation for a control period in a 
given year only if the NO<INF>X</INF> allowances:
    (1) Were allocated for a control period in a prior year or the same 
year; and
    (2) Are held in the unit's compliance account, or the overdraft 
account of the source where the unit is located, as of the 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowance transfer deadline for that control period or 
are transferred into the compliance account or overdraft account by a 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowance transfer correctly submitted for recordation 
under Sec. 97.60 by the NO<INF>X</INF> allowance transfer deadline for 
that control period.
    (b) Deductions for compliance. (1) Following the recordation, in 
accordance with Sec. 97.61, of NO<INF>X</INF> allowance transfers 
submitted for recordation in the unit's compliance account or the 
overdraft account of the source where the unit is located by the 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowance transfer deadline for a control period, the 
Administrator will deduct NO<INF>X</INF> allowances available under 
paragraph (a) of this section to cover the unit's NO<INF>X</INF> 
emissions (as determined in accordance with subpart H of this part), or 
to account for actual heat input under Sec. 97.42(e), for the control 
period:
    (i) From the compliance account; and
    (ii) Only if no more NO<INF>X</INF> allowances available under 
paragraph (a) of this section remain in the compliance account, from the 
overdraft account. In deducting allowances for units at the source from 
the overdraft account, the Administrator will begin with the unit having 
the compliance account with the lowest account number and end with the 
unit having the compliance account with the highest account number (with 
account numbers sorted beginning with the left-most character and ending 
with the right-most character and the letter characters assigned values 
in alphabetical order and less than all numeric characters).
    (2) The Administrator will deduct NO<INF>X</INF> allowances first 
under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section and then under paragraph 
(b)(1)(ii) of this section:
    (i) Until the number of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances deducted for the 
control period equals the number of tons of NO<INF>X</INF> emissions, 
determined in accordance with subpart H of this part, from the unit for 
the control period for which compliance is being determined, plus the 
number of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances required for deduction to account 
for actual heat input under Sec. 97.42(e) for the control period; or
    (ii) Until no more NO<INF>X</INF> allowances available under 
paragraph (a) of this section remain in the respective account.
    (c)(1) Identification of NOX allowances by serial number. The 
NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account representative for each compliance 
account may identify by serial number the NO<INF>X</INF> allowances to 
be deducted from the unit's compliance account under paragraph (b), (d), 
(e), or

[[Page 202]]

(f) of this section. Such identification shall be made in the compliance 
certification report submitted in accordance with Sec. 97.30.
    (2) First-in, first-out. The Administrator will deduct 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances for a control period from the compliance 
account, in the absence of an identification or in the case of a partial 
identification of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances by serial number under 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section, or the overdraft account on a first-
in, first-out (FIFO) accounting basis in the following order:
    (i) Those NO<INF>X</INF> allowances that were allocated for the 
control period to the unit under subpart E or I of this part;
    (ii) Those NO<INF>X</INF> allowances that were allocated for the 
control period to any unit and transferred and recorded in the account 
pursuant to subpart G of this part, in order of their date of 
recordation;
    (iii) Those NO<INF>X</INF> allowances that were allocated for a 
prior control period to the unit under subpart E or I of this part; and
    (iv) Those NO<INF>X</INF> allowances that were allocated for a prior 
control period to any unit and transferred and recorded in the account 
pursuant to subpart G of this part, in order of their date of 
recordation.
    (d) Deductions for excess emissions. (1) After making the deductions 
for compliance under paragraph (b) of this section, the Administrator 
will deduct from the unit's compliance account or the overdraft account 
of the source where the unit is located a number of NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances, allocated for a control period after the control period in 
which the unit has excess emissions, equal to three times the number of 
the unit's excess emissions.
    (2) If the compliance account or overdraft account does not contain 
sufficient NO<INF>X</INF> allowances, the Administrator will deduct the 
required number of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances, regardless of the control 
period for which they were allocated, whenever NO<INF>X</INF> allowances 
are recorded in either account.
    (3) Any allowance deduction required under paragraph (d) of this 
section shall not affect the liability of the owners and operators of 
the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit for any fine, penalty, or assessment, or 
their obligation to comply with any other remedy, for the same 
violation, as ordered under the Clean Air Act or applicable State law. 
The following guidelines will be followed in assessing fines, penalties 
or other obligations:
    (i) For purposes of determining the number of days of violation, if 
a NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit has excess emissions for a control period, 
each day in the control period (153 days) constitutes a day in violation 
unless the owners and operators of the unit demonstrate that a lesser 
number of days should be considered.
    (ii) Each ton of excess emissions is a separate violation.
    (e) Deductions for units sharing a common stack. In the case of 
units sharing a common stack and having emissions that are not 
separately monitored or apportioned in accordance with subpart H of this 
part:
    (1) The NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account representative of the 
units may identify the percentage of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances to be 
deducted from each such unit's compliance account to cover the unit's 
share of NO<INF>X</INF> emissions from the common stack for a control 
period. Such identification shall be made in the compliance 
certification report submitted in accordance with Sec. 97.30.
    (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the 
Administrator will deduct NO<INF>X</INF> allowances for each such unit 
until the number of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances deducted equals the unit's 
identified percentage under paragraph (e)(1) of this section or, if no 
percentage is identified, an equal percentage for each unit multiplied 
by the number of tons of NO<INF>X</INF> emissions, as determined in 
accordance with subpart H of this part, from the common stack for the 
control period for which compliance is being determined. In addition to 
the deductions under the first sentence of this paragraph (e)(1), the 
Administrator will deduct NO<INF>X</INF> allowances for each such unit 
until the number of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances deducted equals the number 
of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances required to account for actual heat input 
under Sec. 97.42(e) for the unit for the control period.
    (f) Deduction of banked allowances. Each year starting in 2006, 
after the

[[Page 203]]

Administrator has completed the designation of banked NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances under Sec. 97.55(b) and before May 1 of the year, the 
Administrator will determine the extent to which banked NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances otherwise available under paragraph (a) of this section are 
available for compliance in the control period for the current year, as 
follows. For each State NO<INF>X</INF> Budget Trading Program that is 
established, and approved and administered by the Administrator pursuant 
to Sec. 51.121 of this chapter, the terms ``compliance account'' or 
``compliance accounts'', ``overdraft account'' or ``overdraft 
accounts'', ``general account'' or ``general accounts'', ``States'', and 
``trading program budgets under Sec. 97.40'' in paragraphs (f)(1) 
through (f)(3) of this section shall be read to include respectively: A 
compliance account or compliance accounts established under such State 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget Trading Program; an overdraft account or overdraft 
accounts established under such State NO<INF>X</INF> Budget Trading 
Program; a general account or general accounts established under such 
State NO<INF>X</INF> Budget Trading Program; the State or portion of a 
State covered by such State NO<INF>X</INF> Budget Trading Program; and 
the trading program budget of the State or portion of a State covered by 
such State NO<INF>X</INF> Budget Trading Program.
    (1) The Administrator will determine the total number of banked 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances held in compliance accounts, overdraft 
accounts, or general accounts.
    (2) If the total number of banked NO<INF>X</INF> allowances 
determined, under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, to be held in 
compliance accounts, overdraft accounts, or general accounts is less 
than or equal to 10 percent of the sum of the trading program budgets 
under Sec. 97.40 for all States for the control period, any banked 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowance may be deducted for compliance in accordance 
with paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.
    (3) If the total number of banked NO<INF>X</INF> allowances 
determined, under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, to be held in 
compliance accounts, overdraft accounts, or general accounts exceeds 10 
percent of the sum of the trading program budgets under Sec. 97.40 for 
all States for the control period, any banked allowance may be deducted 
for compliance in accordance with paragraphs (a) through (e) of this 
section, except as follows:
    (i) The Administrator will determine the following ratio: 0.10 
multiplied by the sum of the trading program budgets under Sec. 97.40 
for all States for the control period and divided by the total number of 
banked NO<INF>X</INF> allowances determined, under paragraph (f)(1) of 
this section, to be held in compliance accounts, overdraft accounts, or 
general accounts.
    (ii) The Administrator will multiply the number of banked 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances in each compliance account or overdraft 
account by the ratio determined under paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this 
section. The resulting product is the number of banked NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances in the account that may be deducted for compliance in 
accordance with paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section. Any banked 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances in excess of the resulting product may be 
deducted for compliance in accordance with paragraphs (a) through (e) of 
this section, except that, if such NO<INF>X</INF> allowances are used to 
make a deduction under paragraph (b) or (e) of this section, two (rather 
than one) such NO<INF>X</INF> allowances shall authorize up to one ton 
of NO<INF>X</INF> emissions during the control period and must be 
deducted for each deduction of one NO<INF>X</INF> allowance required 
under paragraph (b) or (e) of this section.
    (g) Recordation of deductions. The Administrator will record in the 
appropriate compliance account or overdraft account all deductions from 
such an account pursuant to paragraph (b), (d), (e), or (f) of this 
section.

Sec. 97.54, Sec. 97.56, or subpart G or I of this part.
    (b) The Administrator will designate, as a ``banked'' NO<INF>X</INF>

NO<INF>X</INF> Allowance Tracking System accounts.
    (b) If a general account shows no activity for a period of a year or 
more and does not contain any NO<INF>X</INF> allowances, the 
Administrator may notify the NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account 
representative for the account that the account will be closed and 
deleted from the NO<INF>X</INF> Allowance Tracking System following 20 
business days after the notice is sent. The account will be closed after 
the 20-day period unless before the end of the 20-day period the 
Administrator receives a correctly submitted transfer of NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances into the account under Sec. 97.60 or a statement submitted 
by the NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account representative demonstrating to 
the satisfaction of the Administrator good cause as to why the account 
should not be closed.

Rain emissions limitation and that requires additional CEMS under the 
common stack provisions in Sec. 75.72 of this chapter or uses a 
NO<INF>X</INF> concentration CEMS under Sec. 75.71(a)(2) of this 
chapter shall comply with the following procedures.
    (1) Requirements for initial certification. The owner or operator 
shall ensure that each emission monitoring system required by subpart H 
of part 75 of this chapter (which includes the automated data 
acquisition and handling system) successfully completes all of the 
initial certification testing required under Sec. 75.20 of this chapter 
by the applicable deadline in Sec. 97.70(b). In addition, whenever the 
owner or operator installs an emission monitoring system in order to 
meet the requirements of this part in a location where no such emission 
monitoring system was previously installed, initial certification in 
accordance with Sec. 75.20 of this chapter is required.
    (2) Requirements for recertification. Whenever the owner or operator 
makes a replacement, modification, or change in a certified emission 
monitoring system that may significantly affect the ability of the 
system to accurately measure or record NO<INF>X</INF> mass emissions or 
heat input rate or to meet the requirements of Sec. 75.21 of this

shall recertify the emission monitoring system in accordance with Sec. 
75.20(b) of this chapter. Furthermore, whenever the owner or operator 
makes a replacement, modification, or change to the flue gas handling 
system or the unit's operation that may significantly change the stack 
flow or concentration profile, the owner or operator shall recertify the 
continuous emissions monitoring system in accordance with Sec. 75.20(b) 
of this chapter. Examples of changes that require recertification 
include: replacement of the analyzer, complete replacement of an 
existing continuous emission monitoring system, or change in location or 
orientation of the sampling probe or site.
    (3) Certification approval process for initial certification and 
recertification--(i) Notification of certification. The NO<INF>X</INF> 
authorized account representative shall submit to the Administrator, the 
appropriate EPA Regional Office and the permitting authority written 
notice of the dates of certification in accordance with Sec. 97.73.
    (ii) Certification application. The NO<INF>X</INF> authorized 
account representative shall submit to the Administrator, the 
appropriate EPA Regional Office and the permitting authority a 
certification application for each emission monitoring system required 
under subpart H of part 75 of this chapter. A complete certification 
application shall include the information specified in subpart H of part 
75 of this chapter.
    (iii) Except for units using the low mass emission excepted 
methodology under Sec. 75.19 of this chapter, the provisional 
certification date for a monitor shall be determined in accordance with 
Sec. 75.20(a)(3) of this chapter. A provisionally certified monitor may 
be used under the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget Trading Program for a period not 
to exceed 120 days after receipt by the Administrator of the complete 
certification application for the monitoring system under paragraph 
(b)(3)(ii) of this section. Data measured and recorded by the 
provisionally certified monitoring system, in accordance with the 
requirements of part 75 of this chapter, will be considered valid 
quality-assured data (retroactive to the date and time of provisional 
certification), provided that the Administrator does not invalidate the 
provisional certification by issuing a notice of disapproval within 120 
days of receipt of the complete certification application by the 
Administrator.
    (iv) Certification application formal approval process. The 
Administrator will issue a written notice of approval or disapproval of 
the certification application to the owner or operator within 120 days 
of receipt of the complete certification application under paragraph 
(b)(3)(ii) of this section. In the event the Administrator does not 
issue such a notice within such 120-day period, each monitoring system 
that meets the applicable performance requirements of part 75 of this 
chapter and is included in the certification application will be deemed 
certified for use under the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget Trading Program.
    (A) Approval notice. If the certification application is complete 
and shows that each monitoring system

[[Page 209]]

meets the applicable performance requirements of part 75 of this 
chapter, then the Administrator will issue a written notice of approval 
of the certification application within 120 days of receipt.
    (B) Incomplete application notice. A certification application will 
be considered complete when all of the applicable information required 
to be submitted under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section has been 
received by the Administrator. If the certification application is not 
complete, then the Administrator will issue a written notice of 
incompleteness that sets a reasonable date by which the NO<INF>X</INF> 
authorized account representative must submit the additional information 
required to complete the certification application. If the 
NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account representative does not comply with 
the notice of incompleteness by the specified date, then the 
Administrator may issue a notice of disapproval under paragraph 
(b)(3)(iv)(C) of this section. The 120-day review period shall not begin 
prior to receipt of a complete certification application.
    (C) Disapproval notice. If the certification application shows that 
any monitoring system or component thereof does not meet the performance 
requirements of this part, or if the certification application is 
incomplete and the requirement for disapproval under paragraph 
(b)(3)(iv)(B) of this section has been met, then the Administrator will 
issue a written notice of disapproval of the certification application. 
Upon issuance of such notice of disapproval, the provisional 
certification is invalidated by the Administrator and the data measured 
and recorded by each uncertified monitoring system shall not be 
considered valid quality-assured data beginning with the date and hour 
of provisional certification (as defined under Sec. 75.20(a)(3) of this 
chapter). The owner or operator shall follow the procedures for loss of 
certification in paragraph (b)(3)(v) of this section for each monitoring 
system that is disapproved for initial certification.
    (D) Audit decertification. The Administrator may issue a notice of 
disapproval of the certification status of a monitor in accordance with 
Sec. 97.72(b).
    (v) Procedures for loss of certification. If the Administrator 
issues a notice of disapproval of a certification application under 
paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(C) of this section or a notice of disapproval of 
certification status under paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(D) of this section, 
then:
    (A) The owner or operator shall substitute the following values, for 
each hour of unit operation during the period of invalid data specified 
under Sec. 75.20(a)(4)(iii), Sec. 75.20(b)(5), Sec. 75.20(h)(4), or 
Sec. 75.21(e) and continuing until the date and hour specified under 
Sec. 75.20(a)(5)(i) of this chapter:
    (1) For units that the owner or operator intends to monitor or 
monitors for NO<INF>X</INF> emission rate and heat input rate or intends 
to determine or determines NO<INF>X</INF> mass emissions using the low 
mass emission excepted methodology under Sec. 75.19 of this chapter, 
the maximum potential NO<INF>X</INF> emission rate and the maximum 
potential hourly heat input of the unit; and
    (2) For units that the owner or operator intends to monitor or 
monitors for NO<INF>X</INF> mass emissions using a NO<INF>X</INF> 
pollutant concentration monitor and a flow monitor, the maximum 
potential concentration of NO<INF>X</INF> and the maximum potential flow 
rate of the unit under section 2 of appendix A of part 75 of this 
chapter.
    (B) The NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account representative shall 
submit a notification of certification retest dates and a new 
certification application in accordance with paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and 
(ii) of this section.
    (C) The owner or operator shall repeat all certification tests or 
other requirements that were failed by the monitoring system, as 
indicated in the Administrator's notice of disapproval, no later than 30 
unit operating days after the date of issuance of the notice of 
disapproval.
    (c) Initial certification and recertification procedures for low 
mass emission units using the excepted methodologies under Sec. 75.19 
of this chapter. The owner or operator of a gas-fired or oil-fired unit 
using the low mass emissions excepted methodology under Sec. 75.19 of 
this chapter and not subject to an Acid Rain emissions limitation shall 
meet the applicable general operating requirements of Sec. 75.10 of 
this chapter and

[[Page 210]]

the applicable requirements of Sec. 75.19 of this chapter. The owner or 
operator of such a unit shall also meet the applicable certification and 
recertification procedures of paragraph (b) of this section, except that 
the excepted methodology shall be deemed provisionally certified for use 
under the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget Trading Program as of the date on which 
a complete certification application is received by the Administrator. 
The methodology shall be considered to be certified either upon receipt 
of a written notice of approval from the Administrator or, if such 
notice is not provided, at the end of the Administrator's 120 day review 
period. However, a provisionally certified or certified low mass 
emissions excepted methodology shall not be used to report data under 
the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget Trading Program prior to the applicable 
commencement date specified in Sec. 75.19(a)(1)(ii) of this chapter.
    (d) Certification/recertification procedures for alternative 
monitoring systems. The NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account representative 
of each unit not subject to an Acid Rain emissions limitation for which 
the owner or operator intends to use an alternative monitoring system 
approved by the Administrator under subpart E of part 75 of this chapter 
shall comply with the applicable certification procedures of paragraph 
(b) of this section before using the system under the NO<INF>X</INF> 
Budget Trading Program. The NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account 
representative shall also comply with the applicable recertification 
procedures of paragraph (b) of this section. Section 75.20(f) of this 
chapter shall apply to such alternative monitoring system.

Sec. 97.72  Out of control periods.

    (a) Whenever any emission monitoring system fails to meet the 
quality assurance or data validation requirements of part 75 of this 
chapter, data shall be substituted using the applicable procedures in 
subpart D, subpart H, appendix D, or appendix E of part 75 of this 
chapter.
    (b) Audit decertification. Whenever both an audit of an emission 
monitoring system and a review of the initial certification or 
recertification application reveal that any system should not have been 
certified or recertified because it did not meet a particular 
performance specification or other requirement under Sec. 97.71 or the 
applicable provisions of part 75 of this chapter, both at the time of 
the initial certification or recertification application submission and 
at the time of the audit, the Administrator will issue a notice of 
disapproval of the certification status of such system. For the purposes 
of this paragraph, an audit shall be either a field audit or an audit of 
any information submitted to the permitting authority or the 
Administrator. By issuing the notice of disapproval, the Administrator 
revokes prospectively the certification status of the system. The data 
measured and recorded by the system shall not be considered valid 
quality-assured data from the date of issuance of the notification of 
the revoked certification status until the date and time that the owner 
or operator completes subsequently approved initial certification or 
recertification tests for the system. The owner or operator shall follow 
the initial certification or recertification procedures in Sec. 97.71 
for each disapproved system.

<R05>
Sec. 97.80  Applicability.

    A unit that is in a State (as defined in Sec. 97.2), is not a 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit under Sec. 97.4(a), is not a unit exempt 
under Sec. 97.4(b), vents all of its emissions to a stack, and is 
operating, may qualify to be a NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in unit under 
this subpart. A unit that is a NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit under Sec. 
97.4(a), is covered by an exemption under Sec. 97.4(b) or Sec. 97.5 
that is in effect, or is not operating is not eligible to be a 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in unit.


<R05>
Sec. 97.81  General.

    Except otherwise as provided in this part, a NO<INF>X</INF> Budget 
opt-in unit shall be treated as a NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit for 
purposes of applying subparts A through H of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 97.82  NOX authorized account representative.

    A unit for which an application for a NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in 
permit is submitted, or a NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in unit, located at 
the same source as one or more NO<INF>X</INF> Budget units, shall have 
the same NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account representative as such 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget units.


<R05>
Sec. 97.83  Applying for NOX Budget opt-in permit.

    (a) Applying for initial NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in permit. In 
order to apply for an initial NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in permit, the 
NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account representative of a unit qualified 
under Sec. 97.80 may submit to the Administrator and the permitting 
authority at any time, except as provided under Sec. 97.86(g):
    (1) A complete NO<INF>X</INF> Budget permit application under Sec. 
97.22;
    (2) A monitoring plan submitted in accordance with subpart H of this 
part; and
    (3) A complete account certificate of representation under Sec. 
97.13, if no NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account representative has been 
previously designated for the unit.
    (b) Duty to reapply. Unless the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in permit 
is terminated or revised under Sec. 97.86(e) or Sec. 97.87(b)(1)(i), 
the NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account representative of a NO<INF>X</INF> 
Budget opt-in unit shall submit to the Administrator and permitting 
authority a complete NO<INF>X</INF> Budget permit application under 
Sec. 97.22 to renew the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in permit in 
accordance with Sec. 97.21(c) and, if applicable, an updated monitoring 
plan in accordance with subpart H of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 97.84  Opt-in process.

    The permitting authority will issue or deny an initial 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in permit for a unit for which an application 
for a NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in permit under Sec. 97.83 is 
submitted, in accordance with Sec. 97.20 and the following:
    (a) Interim review of monitoring plan. The Administrator will 
determine, on an interim basis, the sufficiency of the monitoring plan 
accompanying the initial application for a NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in 
permit under Sec. 97.83. A monitoring plan is sufficient, for purposes 
of interim review, if the plan appears to contain information 
demonstrating that the NO<INF>X</INF> emissions rate and heat input rate 
of the unit are monitored and reported in accordance with subpart H of 
this part. A determination of sufficiency shall not be construed as 
acceptance or approval of the unit's monitoring plan.
    (b) If the Administrator determines that the unit's monitoring plan 
is sufficient under paragraph (a) of this section and after completion 
of monitoring system certification under subpart H of this part, the 
NO<INF>X</INF> emissions rate and the heat input of the unit shall be 
monitored and reported in accordance with subpart H of this part for one 
full control period during which percent monitor data availability is 
not less than 90 percent and during which the unit is in full compliance 
with any applicable State or Federal emissions or emissions-related 
requirements. Solely for purposes of applying the requirements in the 
prior sentence, the unit shall be treated as a ``NO<INF>X</INF> Budget 
unit'' prior to issuance of a NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in permit 
covering the unit.
    (c) Based on the information monitored and reported under paragraph 
(b) of this section, the Administrator will calculate the unit's 
baseline heat input, which will equal the unit's total heat input (in 
mmBtu) for the control period, and the unit's baseline NO<INF>X</INF> 
emissions rate, which will equal the unit's total NO<INF>X</INF> mass 
emissions (in lb)

[[Page 214]]

for the control period divided by the unit's baseline heat input.
    (d) Issuance of draft NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in permit for public 
comment. The permitting authority will issue a draft NO<INF>X</INF> 
Budget opt-in permit for public comment in accordance with Sec. 97.20.
    (e) Not withstanding paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, if 
at any time before issuance of a draft NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in 
permit for public comment for the unit, the Administrator or the 
permitting authority determines that the unit does not qualify as a 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in unit under Sec. 97.80, the permitting 
authority will issue a draft denial of a NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in 
permit for public comment for the unit in accordance with Sec. 97.20.
    (f) Withdrawal of application for NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in 
permit. A NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account representative of a unit may 
withdraw its application for an initial NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in 
permit under Sec. 97.83 at any time prior to the issuance of the 
initial NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in permit. Once the application for a 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in permit is withdrawn, a NO<INF>X</INF> 
authorized account representative wanting to reapply must submit a new 
application for an initial NO<INF>X</INF> Budget permit under Sec. 
97.83.
    (g) The unit shall be a NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in unit and a 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit starting May 1 of the first control period 
starting after the issuance of the initial NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in 
permit by the permitting authority.


<R05>
Sec. 97.85  NOX Budget opt-in permit contents.

    (a) Each NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in permit will contain all 
elements required for a complete NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in permit 
application under Sec. 97.22.
    (b) Each NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in permit is deemed to 
incorporate automatically the definitions of terms under Sec. 97.2 and, 
upon recordation by the Administrator under subpart F or G of this part, 
every allocation, transfer, or deduction of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances to 
or from the compliance accounts of each NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in 
unit covered by the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in permit or the overdraft 
account of the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget source where the NO<INF>X</INF> 
Budget opt-in unit is located.

Sec. 97.86  Withdrawal from NOX Budget Trading Program.

    (a) Requesting withdrawal. To withdraw from the NO<INF>X</INF> 
Budget Trading Program, the NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account 
representative of a NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in unit shall submit to 
the Administrator and the permitting authority a request to withdraw 
effective as of a specified date prior to May 1 or after September 30. 
The submission shall be made no later than 90 days prior to the 
requested effective date of withdrawal.
    (b) Conditions for withdrawal. Before a NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in 
unit covered by a request under paragraph (a) of this section may 
withdraw from the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget Trading Program and the 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in permit may be terminated under paragraph 
(e) of this section, the following conditions must be met:
    (1) For the control period immediately before the withdrawal is to 
be effective, the NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account representative must 
submit or must have submitted to the Administrator and the permitting 
authority an annual compliance certification report in accordance with 
Sec. 97.30.
    (2) If the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in unit has excess emissions 
for the control period immediately before the withdrawal is to be 
effective, the Administrator will deduct or has deducted from the 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in unit's compliance account, or the overdraft 
account of the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget source where the NO<INF>X</INF> 
Budget opt-in unit is located, the full amount required under Sec. 
97.54(d) for the control period.
    (3) After the requirements for withdrawal under paragraphs (b)(1) 
and (2) of this section are met, the Administrator will deduct from the 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in unit's compliance account, or the overdraft 
account of the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget source where the NO<INF>X</INF> 
Budget opt-in unit is located, NO<INF>X</INF> allowances equal in number 
to and allocated for the same or a prior control period as any 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances allocated to that source under Sec. 97.88 for 
any control period for which the withdrawal is to be effective. The 
Administrator will close the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in unit's 
compliance account and transfer any remaining allowances to a general 
account specified by the owners and operators of the NO<INF>X</INF> 
Budget opt-in unit.

[[Page 215]]

    (c) A NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in unit that withdraws from the 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget Trading Program shall comply with all requirements 
under the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget Trading Program concerning all years for 
which such NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in unit was a NO<INF>X</INF> Budget 
opt-in unit, even if such requirements arise or must be complied with 
after the withdrawal takes effect.
    (d) Notification. (1) After the requirements for withdrawal under 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section are met (including deduction of 
the full amount of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances required), the 
Administrator will issue a notification to the permitting authority and 
the NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account representative of the 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in unit of the acceptance of the withdrawal of 
the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in unit as of a specified effective date 
that is after such requirements have been met and that is prior to May 1 
or after September 30.
    (2) If the requirements for withdrawal under paragraphs (a) and (b) 
of this section are not met, the Administrator will issue a notification 
to the permitting authority and the NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account 
representative of the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in unit that the request 
to withdraw is denied. If the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in unit's 
request to withdraw is denied, the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in unit 
shall remain subject to the requirements for a NO<INF>X</INF> Budget 
opt-in unit.
    (e) Permit revision. After the Administrator issues a notification 
under paragraph (d)(1) of this section that the requirements for 
withdrawal have been met, the permitting authority will revise the 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget permit covering the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in 
unit to terminate the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in permit as of the 
effective date specified under paragraph (d)(1) of this section. A 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in unit shall continue to be a NO<INF>X</INF> 
Budget opt-in unit until the effective date of the termination.
    (f) Reapplication upon failure to meet conditions of withdrawal. If 
the Administrator denies the request to withdraw the NO<INF>X</INF> 
Budget opt-in unit, the NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account representative 
may submit another request to withdraw in accordance with paragraphs (a) 
and (b) of this section.
    (g) Ability to return to the NOX Budget Trading Program. Once a 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in unit withdraws from the NO<INF>X</INF> 
Budget Trading Program and its NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in permit is 
terminated under paragraph (e) of this section, the NO<INF>X</INF> 
authorized account representative may not submit another application for 
a NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in permit under Sec. 97.83 for the unit 
prior to the date that is 4 years after the date on which the terminated 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in permit became effective.


<R05>
Sec. 97.87  Change in regulatory status.

    (a) Notification. When a NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in unit becomes a 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit under Sec. 97.4(a), the NO<INF>X</INF> 
authorized account representative shall notify in writing the permitting 
authority and the Administrator of such change in the NO<INF>X</INF> 
Budget opt-in unit's regulatory status, within 30 days of such change.
    (b) Permitting authority's and Administrator's action. (1)(i) When 
the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in unit becomes a NO<INF>X</INF> Budget 
unit under Sec. 97.4(a), the permitting authority will revise the 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in unit's NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in permit 
to meet the requirements of a NO<INF>X</INF> Budget permit under Sec. 
97.23 as of an effective date that is the date on which such 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in unit becomes a NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit 
under Sec. 97.4(a).
    (ii)(A) The Administrator will deduct from the compliance account 
for the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this 
section, or the overdraft account of the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget source 
where the unit is located, NO<INF>X</INF> allowances equal in number to 
and allocated for the same or a prior control period as:
    (1) Any NO<INF>X</INF> allowances allocated to the NO<INF>X</INF> 
Budget unit (as a NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in unit) under Sec. 97.88 
for any control period after the last control period during which the 
unit's NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in permit was effective; and
    (2) If the effective date of the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget permit 
revision under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section is during a control 
period, the NO<INF>X</INF> allowances allocated to the NO<INF>X</INF> 
Budget unit (as a NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in unit) under Sec. 97.88 
for the control period multiplied by the number of days in the control 
period

[[Page 216]]

starting with the effective date of the permit revision under paragraph 
(b)(1)(i) of this section, divided by the total number of days in the 
control period, and rounded to the nearest whole number of 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances as appropriate.
    (B) The NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account representative shall 
ensure that the compliance account of the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit 
under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, or the overdraft account of 
the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget source where the unit is located, contains the 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances necessary for completion of the deduction 
under paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section. If the compliance account 
or overdraft account does not contain the necessary NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances, the Administrator will deduct the required number of 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances, regardless of the control period for which 
they were allocated, whenever NO<INF>X</INF> allowances are recorded in 
either account.
    (iii)(A) For every control period during which the NO<INF>X</INF> 
Budget permit revised under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section is in 
effect, the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this 
section will be treated, solely for purposes of NO<INF>X</INF> allowance 
allocations under Sec. 97.42, as a unit that commenced operation on the 
effective date of the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget permit revision under 
paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section and will be allocated NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances under Sec. 97.42. The unit's deadline under Sec. 97.84(b) 
for meeting monitoring requirements in accordance with subpart H of this 
part shall not be changed by the change in the unit's regulatory status 
or by the revision of the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget permit under paragraph 
(b)(1)(i) of this section.
    (B) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(A) of this section, if the 
effective date of the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget permit revision under 
paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section is during a control period, the 
following number of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances will be allocated to the 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section 
under Sec. 97.42 for the control period: the number of NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances otherwise allocated to the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget unit under 
Sec. 97.42 for the control period multiplied by the number of days in 
the control period starting with the effective date of the permit 
revision under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, divided by the total 
number of days in the control period, and rounded to the nearest whole 
number of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances as appropriate.
    (2)(i) When the NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account representative of 
a NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in unit does not renew its NO<INF>X</INF> 
Budget opt-in permit under Sec. 97.83(b), the Administrator will deduct 
from the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in unit's compliance account, or the 
overdraft account of the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget source where the 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in unit is located, NO<INF>X</INF> allowances 
equal in number to and allocated for the same or a prior control period 
as any NO<INF>X</INF> allowances allocated to the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget 
opt-in unit under Sec. 97.88 for any control period after the last 
control period for which the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in permit is 
effective. The NO<INF>X</INF> authorized account representative shall 
ensure that the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in unit's compliance account 
or the overdraft account of the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget source where the 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in unit is located contains the NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances necessary for completion of such deduction. If the compliance 
account or overdraft account does not contain the necessary 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances, the Administrator will deduct the required 
number of NO<INF>X</INF> allowances, regardless of the control period 
for which they were allocated, whenever NO<INF>X</INF> allowances are 
recorded in either account.
    (ii) After the deduction under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section 
is completed, the Administrator will close the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget 
opt-in unit's compliance account. If any NO<INF>X</INF> allowances 
remain in the compliance account after completion of such deduction and 
any deduction under Sec. 97.54, the Administrator will close the 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in unit's compliance account and transfer any 
remaining allowances to a general account specified by the owners and 
operators of the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in unit.

Sec. 97.88  NOX allowance allocations to opt-in units.

    (a) NOX allotment allocation. (1) By April 1 immediately before the 
first control period for which the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in permit 
is effective, the Administrator will determine by order

[[Page 217]]

the NO<INF>X</INF> allowance allocations for the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget 
opt-in unit for the control period in accordance with paragraph (b) of 
this section.
    (2) By no later than April 1, after the first control period for 
which the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in permit is in effect, and April 1 
of each year thereafter, the Administrator will determine by order the 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowance allocations for the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-
in unit for the next control period, in accordance with paragraph (b) of 
this section.
    (3) The Administrator will make available to the public each 
determination of NO<INF>X</INF> allowance allocations under paragraph 
(a)(1) or (2) of this section and will provide an opportunity for 
submission of objections to the determination. Objections shall be 
limited to addressing whether the determination is in accordance with 
paragraph (b) of this section. Based on any such objections, the 
Administrator will adjust each determination to the extent necessary to 
ensure that it is in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) For each control period for which the NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-
in unit has an approved NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in permit, the 
NO<INF>X</INF> Budget opt-in unit will be allocated NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances in accordance with the following procedures:
    (1) The heat input (in mmBtu) used for calculating NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowance allocations will be the lesser of:
    (i) The unit's baseline heat input determined pursuant to Sec. 
97.84(c); or
    (ii) The unit's heat input, as determined in accordance with subpart 
H of this part, for the control period in the year prior to the year of 
the control period for which the NO<INF>X</INF> allocations are being 
calculated.
    (2) The Administrator will allocate NO<INF>X</INF> allowances to the 
unit in an amount equaling the heat input determined under paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section multiplied by the lesser of the unit's baseline 
NO<INF>X</INF> emissions rate determined under Sec. 97.84(c) or the 
most stringent State or federal NO<INF>X</INF> emissions limitation 
applicable to the unit during the control period, divided by 2,000 lb/
ton, and rounded to the nearest whole number of NO<INF>X</INF>

operator of a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> source or a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> unit 
is not included in the list of owners and operators in the certificate 
of representation under Sec. 97.113, such owner or operator shall be 
deemed to be subject to and bound by the certificate of representation, 
the representations, actions, inactions, and submissions of the CAIR 
designated representative and any alternate CAIR designated 
representative of the source or unit, and the decisions and orders of 
the permitting authority, the Administrator, or a court, as if the owner 
or operator were included in such list.
    (2) Within 30 days following any change in the owners and operators 
of a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> source or a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> unit, including 
the addition of a new owner or operator, the CAIR designated 
representative or any alternate CAIR designated representative shall 
submit a revision to the certificate of representation under Sec. 
97.113 amending the list of owners and operators to include the change.

<R05>
Sec. 97.142  CAIR NOX allowance allocations.

    (a)(1) The baseline heat input (in mmBtu) used with respect to CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowance allocations under paragraph (b) of this section 
for each CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> unit will be:
    (i) For units commencing operation before January 1, 2001 the 
average of the 3 highest amounts of the unit's adjusted control period 
heat input for 2000 through 2004, with the adjusted control period heat 
input for each year calculated as follows:
    (A) If the unit is coal-fired during the year, the unit's control 
period heat input for such year is multiplied by 100 percent;
    (B) If the unit is oil-fired during the year, the unit's control 
period heat input for such year is multiplied by 60 percent; and
    (C) If the unit is not subject to paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) or (B) of 
this section, the unit's control period heat input for such year is 
multiplied by 40 percent.
    (ii) For units commencing operation on or after January 1, 2001 and 
operating each calendar year during a period of 5 or more consecutive 
calendar years, the average of the 3 highest amounts of the unit's total 
converted control period heat input over the first such 5 years.
    (2)(i) A unit's control period heat input, and a unit's status as 
coal-fired or oil-fired, for a calendar year under paragraph (a)(1)(i) 
of this section, and a unit's total tons of NO<INF>X</INF> emissions 
during a calendar year under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, will be 
determined in accordance with part 75 of this chapter, to the extent the 
unit was otherwise subject to the requirements of part 75 of this 
chapter for the year, or will be based on the best available data 
reported to the Administrator for the unit (in a format prescribed by 
the Administrator), to the extent the unit was not otherwise subject to 
the requirements of part 75 of this chapter for the year.
    (ii) A unit's converted control period heat input for a calendar 
year specified under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section equals:
    (A) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(B) or (C) of this 
section, the control period gross electrical output of the generator or 
generators served by the unit multiplied by 7,900 Btu/kWh, if the unit 
is coal-fired for the year, or 6,675 Btu/kWh, if the unit is not coal-
fired for the year, and divided by 1,000,000 Btu/mmBtu, provided that if 
a generator is served by 2 or more units, then the gross electrical 
output of the generator will be attributed to each unit in proportion to 
the unit's share of the total control period heat input of such units 
for the year;
    (B) For a unit that is a boiler and has equipment used to produce 
electricity and useful thermal energy for industrial, commercial, 
heating, or cooling purposes through the sequential use of energy, the 
total heat energy (in Btu) of the steam produced by the boiler during 
the control period, divided by 0.8 and by 1,000,000 Btu/mmBtu; or
    (C) For a unit that is a combustion turbine and has equipment used 
to produce electricity and useful thermal energy for industrial, 
commercial, heating, or cooling purposes through the sequential use of 
energy, the control period gross electrical output of the enclosed 
device comprising the compressor, combustor, and turbine multiplied by 
3,413 Btu/kWh, plus the total heat energy (in Btu) of the steam produced 
by any associated heat recovery steam generator during the control 
period divided by 0.8, and with the sum divided by 1,000,000 Btu/mmBtu.
    (iii) Gross electrical output and total heat energy under paragraph 
(a)(2)(ii) of this section will be determined based on the best 
available data reported to the Administrator for the unit (in a format 
prescribed by the Administrator).
    (3) The Administrator will determine what data are the best 
available data under paragraph (a)(2) of this section by weighing the 
likelihood that data are accurate and reliable and giving greater weight 
to data submitted to a governmental entity in compliance with legal 
requirements or substantiated by an independent entity.
    (b)(1) For each control period in 2009 and thereafter, the 
Administrator will allocate to all CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> units in a State 
that have a baseline heat input (as determined under paragraph (a) of 
this section) a total amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances equal to 
95 percent for

[[Page 237]]

a control period during 2009 through 2014, and 97 percent for a control 
period during 2015 and thereafter, of the tons of NO<INF>X</INF> 
emissions in the applicable State trading budget under Sec. 97.140 
(except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section).
    (2) The Administrator will allocate CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances 
to each CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> unit under paragraph (b)(1) of this section 
in an amount determined by multiplying the total amount of CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances allocated under paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section by the ratio of the baseline heat input of such CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> unit to the total amount of baseline heat input of all 
such CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> units in the State and rounding to the nearest 
whole allowance as appropriate.
    (c) For each control period in 2009 and thereafter, the 
Administrator will allocate CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances to CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> units in a State that are not allocated CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances under paragraph (b) of this section because 
the units do not yet have a baseline heat input under paragraph (a) of 
this section or because the units have a baseline heat input but all 
CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances available under paragraph (b) of this 
section for the control period are already allocated, in accordance with 
the following procedures:
    (1) The Administrator will establish a separate new unit set-aside 
for each control period. Each new unit set-aside will be allocated CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances equal to 5 percent for a control period in 
2009 through 2014, and 3 percent for a control period in 2015 and 
thereafter, of the amount of tons of NO<INF>X</INF> emissions in the 
applicable State trading budget under Sec. 97.140.
    (2) The CAIR designated representative of such a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
unit may submit to the Administrator a request, in a format specified by 
the Administrator, to be allocated CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances, 
starting with the later of the control period in 2009 or the first 
control period after the control period in which the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
unit commences commercial operation and until the first control period 
for which the unit is allocated CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances under 
paragraph (b) of this section. A separate CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowance 
allocation request for each control period for which CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances are sought must be submitted on or before May 1 of such 
control period and after the date on which the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> unit 
commences commercial operation.
    (3) In a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowance allocation request under 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the CAIR designated representative may 
request for a control period CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances in an amount 
not exceeding the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> unit's total tons of 
NO<INF>X</INF> emissions during the calendar year immediately before 
such control period.
    (4) The Administrator will review each CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowance 
allocation request under paragraph (c)(2) of this section and will 
allocate CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances for each control period pursuant 
to such request as follows:
    (i) The Administrator will accept an allowance allocation request 
only if the request meets, or is adjusted by the Administrator as 
necessary to meet, the requirements of paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this 
section.
    (ii) On or after May 1 of the control period, the Administrator will 
determine the sum of the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances requested (as 
adjusted under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section) in all allowance 
allocation requests accepted under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section 
for the control period.
    (iii) If the amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances in the new 
unit set-aside for the control period is greater than or equal to the 
sum under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, then the Administrator 
will allocate the amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances requested (as 
adjusted under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section) to each CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> unit covered by an allowance allocation request accepted 
under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section.
    (iv) If the amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances in the new unit 
set-aside for the control period is less than the sum under paragraph 
(c)(4)(ii) of this section, then the Administrator will allocate to each 
CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> unit covered by an allowance allocation request 
accepted under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section the amount of the 
CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances requested (as adjusted under paragraph 
(c)(4)(i) of this section), multiplied by the amount of CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances in the new unit set-aside for

[[Page 238]]

the control period, divided by the sum determined under paragraph 
(c)(4)(ii) of this section, and rounded to the nearest whole allowance 
as appropriate.
    (v) The Administrator will notify each CAIR designated 
representative that submitted an allowance allocation request of the 
amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances (if any) allocated for the 
control period to the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> unit covered by the request.
    (d) If, after completion of the procedures under paragraph (c)(4) of 
this section for a control period, any unallocated CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances remain in the new unit set-aside under paragraph (c) of this 
section for a State for the control period, the Administrator will 
allocate to each CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> unit that was allocated CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances under paragraph (b) of this section in the 
State an amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances equal to the total 
amount of such remaining unallocated CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances, 
multiplied by the unit's allocation under paragraph (b) of this section, 
divided by 95 percent for a control period during 2009 through 2014, and 
97 percent for a control period during 2015 and thereafter, of the 
amount of tons of NO<INF>X</INF> emissions in the applicable State 
trading budget under Sec. 97.140, and rounded to the nearest whole 
allowance as appropriate.
    (e) If the Administrator determines that CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances were allocated under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, 
paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section, or paragraph (d) of this section 
for a control period and that the recipient of the allocation is not 
actually a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> unit under Sec. 97.104 in such control 
period, then the Administrator will notify the CAIR designated 
representative and will act in accordance with the following procedures:
    (1) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) or (3) of this section, 
the Administrator will not record such CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances 
under Sec. 97.153.
    (2) If the Administrator already recorded such CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances under Sec. 97.153 and if the Administrator makes such 
determination before making deductions for the source that includes such 
recipient under Sec. 97.154(b) for the control period, then the 
Administrator will deduct from the account in which such CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances were recorded under Sec. 97.153 an amount of 
CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances allocated for the same or a prior control 
period equal to the amount of such already recorded CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances. The CAIR designated representative shall ensure that there 
are sufficient CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances in such account for 
completion of the deduction.
    (3) If the Administrator already recorded such CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances under Sec. 97.153 and if the Administrator makes such 
determination after making deductions for the source that includes such 
recipient under Sec. 97.154(b) for the control period, then the 
Administrator will apply paragraph (e)(1) or (2) of this section, as 
appropriate, to any subsequent control period for which CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances were allocated to such recipient.
    (4) The Administrator will transfer the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances that are not recorded, or that are deducted, in accordance 
with paragraphs (e)(1), (2), and (3) of this section to a new unit set-
aside for the State in which such recipient is located.

    (b) For any CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> unit in a State, if the unit's 
average annual NO<INF>X</INF> emission rate for 2007 or 2008 is less 
than 0.25 lb/mmBtu and, where such unit is included in a NO<INF>X</INF> 
averaging plan under Sec. 76.11 of this chapter under the Acid Rain 
Program for such year, the unit's NO<INF>X</INF> averaging plan has an 
actual weighted average NO<INF>X</INF> emission rate for such year equal 
to or less than the actual weighted average NO<INF>X</INF> emission rate 
for the year before such year and if the unit achieves NO<INF>X</INF> 
emission reductions in 2007 and 2008, the CAIR designated representative 
of the unit may request early reduction credits, and allocation of CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances from the compliance supplement pool under 
paragraph (a) of this section for such early reduction credits, in 
accordance with the following:
    (1) The owners and operators of such CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> unit shall 
monitor and report the NO<INF>X</INF> emissions rate and the heat input 
of the unit in accordance with subpart HH of this part in each control 
period for which early reduction credit is requested.
    (2) The CAIR designated representative of such CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
unit shall submit to the Administrator by May 1, 2009 a request, in a 
format specified by the Administrator, for allocation of an amount of 
CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances from the compliance supplement pool not 
exceeding the sum of the unit's heat input for the control period in 
2007 multiplied by the difference (if any greater than zero) between 
0.25 lb/mmBtu and the unit's NO<INF>X</INF> emission rate for the 
control period in 2007 plus the unit's heat input for the control period 
in 2008 multiplied by the difference (if any greater than zero) between 
0.25 lb/mmBtu and the unit's NO<INF>X</INF> emission rate for the 
control period in 2008, determined in accordance with subpart HH of this 
part and with the sum divided by 2,000 lb/ton and rounded to the nearest 
whole number of tons as appropriate.
    (c) For any CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> unit in a State whose compliance 
with the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> emissions limitation for the control period 
in 2009 would create an undue risk to the reliability of electricity 
supply during such control period, the CAIR designated representative of 
the unit may request the allocation of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances 
from the compliance supplement pool under paragraph (a) of this section, 
in accordance with the following:
    (1) The CAIR designated representative of such CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
unit shall submit to the Administrator by May 1, 2009 a request, in a 
format specified by the Administrator, for allocation of an amount of 
CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances from the compliance supplement pool not 
exceeding the minimum amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances necessary 
to remove such undue risk to the reliability of electricity supply.
    (2) In the request under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the CAIR 
designated representative of such CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> unit shall 
demonstrate that, in the absence of allocation to the unit of the amount 
of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances requested, the unit's compliance with 
the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> emissions limitation for the control period in 
2009 would create an undue risk to the reliability of electricity supply 
during such control period. This demonstration must include a showing 
that it would not be feasible for the owners and operators of the unit 
to:
    (i) Obtain a sufficient amount of electricity from other electricity 
generation facilities, during the installation of control technology at 
the unit for compliance with the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> emissions 
limitation, to prevent such undue risk; or
    (ii) Obtain under paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section, or 
otherwise obtain, a sufficient amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances 
to prevent such undue risk.
    (d) The Administrator will review each request under paragraph (b) 
or (c) of this section submitted by May 1, 2009 and will allocate CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances for the control period in 2009 to CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> units in a State and covered by such request as follows:

[[Page 240]]

    (1) Upon receipt of each such request, the Administrator will make 
any necessary adjustments to the request to ensure that the amount of 
the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances requested meets the requirements of 
paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.
    (2) If the State's compliance supplement pool under paragraph (a) of 
this section has an amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances not less 
than the total amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances in all such 
requests (as adjusted under paragraph (d)(1) of this section), the 
Administrator will allocate to each CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> unit covered by 
such requests the amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances requested (as 
adjusted under paragraph (d)(1) of this section).
    (3) If the State's compliance supplement pool under paragraph (a) of 
this section has a smaller amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances than 
the total amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances in all such requests 
(as adjusted under paragraph (d)(1) of this section), the Administrator 
will allocate CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances to each CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
unit covered by such requests according to the following formula and 
rounding to the nearest whole allowance as appropriate:

Unit's allocation = Unit's adjusted allocation x (State's compliance 
    supplement pool / Total adjusted allocations for all units)

Where:

``Unit's allocation'' is the amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances 
allocated to the unit from the State's compliance supplement pool.
``Unit's adjusted allocation'' is the amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances requested for the unit under paragraph (b) or (c) of this 
section, as adjusted under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
``State's compliance supplement pool'' is the amount of CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances in the State's compliance supplement pool.
``Total adjusted allocations for all units'' is the sum of the amounts 
of allocations requested for all units under paragraph (b) or (c) of 
this section, as adjusted under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

    (4) By July 31, 2009, the Administrator will determine by order the 
allocations under paragraph (d)(2) or (3) of this section. The 
Administrator will make available to the public each determination of 
CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances under such paragraph and will provide an 
opportunity for submission of objections to the determination. 
Objections shall be limited to addressing whether the determination is 
in accordance with paragraph (b) or (c) of this section and paragraph 
(d)(2) or (3) of this section, as appropriate. Based on any such 
objections, the Administrator will adjust each determination to the 
extent necessary to ensure that it is in accordance with such 
paragraphs.
    (5) By January 1, 2010, the Administrator will record the 
allocations under paragraph (d)(4) of this section.

section, no objection or other communication submitted to the 
Administrator concerning the authorization, or any representation, 
action, inaction, or submission of the CAIR authorized account 
representative or any alternate CAIR authorized account representative 
for a general account shall affect any representation, action, inaction, 
or submission of the CAIR authorized account representative or any 
alternate CAIR authorized account representative or the finality of any 
decision or order by the Administrator under the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
Annual Trading Program.

2012, and 2013.
    (d) By December 1, 2010 and December 1 of each year thereafter, the 
Administrator will record in the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> source's compliance 
account the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances allocated for the CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> units at the source in accordance with Sec. 97.142(a) 
and (b) for the control period in the fourth year after the year of the 
applicable deadline for recordation under this paragraph.
    (e) By December 1, 2009 and December 1 of each year thereafter, the 
Administrator will record in the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> source's compliance 
account the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances allocated for the CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> units at the source in accordance with Sec. 97.142(a) 
and (c) for the control period in the year of the applicable deadline 
for recordation under this paragraph.
    (f) Serial numbers for allocated CAIR NOX allowances. When recording 
the allocation of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances for a CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> unit in a compliance account, the Administrator will 
assign each CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowance a unique identification number 
that will include digits identifying the year of the control period for 
which the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowance is allocated.


<R05>
Sec. 97.154  Compliance with CAIR NOX emissions limitation.

    (a) Allowance transfer deadline. The CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances 
are available to be deducted for compliance with a source's CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> emissions limitation for a control period in a given 
calendar year only if the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances:
    (1) Were allocated for the control period in the year or a prior 
year; and
    (2) Are held in the compliance account as of the allowance transfer 
deadline for the control period or are transferred into the compliance 
account by a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowance transfer correctly submitted 
for recordation under Sec. Sec. 97.160 and 97.161 by the allowance 
transfer deadline for the control period.
    (b) Deductions for compliance. Following the recordation, in 
accordance with Sec. 97.161, of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowance transfers 
submitted for recordation in a source's compliance account by the 
allowance transfer deadline for a control period, the Administrator will 
deduct from the compliance account CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances 
available under paragraph (a) of this section in order to determine 
whether the source meets the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> emissions limitation 
for the control period, as follows:
    (1) Until the amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances deducted 
equals the number of tons of total nitrogen oxides emissions, determined 
in accordance with subpart HH of this part, from all CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
units at the source for the control period; or
    (2) If there are insufficient CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances to 
complete the deductions in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, until no 
more CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances available under paragraph (a) of 
this section remain in the compliance account.
    (c)(1) Identification of CAIR NOX allowances by serial number. The 
CAIR authorized account representative for a source's compliance account 
may request that specific CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances, identified by 
serial number, in the compliance account be deducted for emissions or 
excess emissions for a control period in accordance with paragraph (b) 
or (d) of this section. Such request shall be submitted to the 
Administrator by the allowance transfer deadline for the control period 
and include, in a format prescribed by the Administrator, the 
identification of the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> source and the appropriate 
serial numbers.

[[Page 246]]

    (2) First-in, first-out. The Administrator will deduct CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances under paragraph (b) or (d) of this section 
from the source's compliance account, in the absence of an 
identification or in the case of a partial identification of CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances by serial number under paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section, on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) accounting basis in the 
following order:
    (i) Any CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances that were allocated to the 
units at the source, in the order of recordation; and then
    (ii) Any CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances that were allocated to any 
entity and transferred and recorded in the compliance account pursuant 
to subpart GG of this part, in the order of recordation.
    (d) Deductions for excess emissions. (1) After making the deductions 
for compliance under paragraph (b) of this section for a control period 
in a calendar year in which the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> source has excess 
emissions, the Administrator will deduct from the source's compliance 
account an amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances, allocated for the 
control period in the immediately following calendar year, equal to 3 
times the number of tons of the source's excess emissions.
    (2) Any allowance deduction required under paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section shall not affect the liability of the owners and operators of 
the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> source or the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> units at the 
source for any fine, penalty, or assessment, or their obligation to 
comply with any other remedy, for the same violations, as ordered under 
the Clean Air Act or applicable State law.
    (e) Recordation of deductions. The Administrator will record in the 
appropriate compliance account all deductions from such an account under 
paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section and subpart II.
    (f) Administrator's action on submissions. (1) The Administrator may 
review and conduct independent audits concerning any submission under 
the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Annual Trading Program and make appropriate 
adjustments of the information in the submissions.
    (2) The Administrator may deduct CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances from 
or transfer CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances to a source's compliance 
account based on the information in the submissions, as adjusted under 
paragraph (f)(1) of this section, and record such deductions and 
transfers.

Sec. 97.155  Banking.

    (a) CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances may be banked for future use or 
transfer in a compliance account or a general account in accordance with 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) Any CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowance that is held in a compliance 
account or a general account will remain in such account unless and 
until the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowance is deducted or transferred under 
Sec. 97.142, Sec. 97.154, Sec. 97.156, or subpart GG or II of this 
part.


<R05>
Sec. 97.156  Account error.

    The Administrator may, at his or her sole discretion and on his or 
her own motion, correct any error in any CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Allowance 
Tracking System account. Within 10 business days of making such 
correction, the Administrator will notify the CAIR authorized account 
representative for the account.


<R05>
Sec. 97.157  Closing of general accounts.

    (a) The CAIR authorized account representative of a general account 
may submit to the Administrator a request to close the account, which 
shall include a correctly submitted allowance transfer under Sec. Sec. 
97.160 and 97.161 for any CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances in the account 
to one or more other CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Allowance Tracking System 
accounts.
    (b) If a general account has no allowance transfers in or out of the 
account for a 12-month period or longer and does not contain any CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances, the Administrator may notify the CAIR 
authorized account representative for the account that the account will 
be closed following 20 business days after the notice is sent. The 
account will be closed after the 20-day period unless, before the end of 
the 20-day period, the Administrator receives a correctly submitted 
transfer of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances into the account under 
Sec. Sec. 97.160 and 97.161 or a statement submitted by the CAIR 
authorized account representative demonstrating to the satisfaction of 
the Administrator good

recertify each continuous emission monitoring system whose accuracy is 
potentially affected by the change, in accordance with Sec. 75.20(b) of 
this chapter. Examples of changes to a continuous emission monitoring 
system that require recertification include replacement of the analyzer, 
complete replacement of an existing continuous emission monitoring 
system, or change in location or orientation of the sampling probe or 
site. Any fuel flowmeter system, and any excepted NO<INF>X</INF> 
monitoring system under appendix E to part 75 of this chapter, under 
Sec. 97.170(a)(1) are subject to the recertification requirements in 
Sec. 75.20(g)(6) of this chapter.
    (3) Approval process for initial certification and recertification. 
Paragraphs (d)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section apply to both initial 
certification and recertification of a continuous monitoring system 
under Sec. 97.170(a)(1). For recertifications, replace the words 
``certification'' and ``initial certification'' with the word 
``recertification'', replace the word ``certified'' with the word 
``recertified'', and follow the procedures in Sec. Sec. 75.20(b)(5) and 
(g)(7) of this chapter in lieu of the procedures in paragraph (d)(3)(v) 
of this section.
    (i) Notification of certification. The CAIR designated 
representative shall submit to the appropriate EPA Regional Office and 
the Administrator written notice of the dates of certification testing, 
in accordance with Sec. 97.173.
    (ii) Certification application. The CAIR designated representative 
shall submit to the Administrator a certification application for each 
monitoring system. A complete certification application shall include 
the information specified in Sec. 75.63 of this chapter.
    (iii) Provisional certification date. The provisional certification 
date for a monitoring system shall be determined in accordance with 
Sec. 75.20(a)(3) of this chapter. A provisionally certified monitoring 
system may be used under the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Annual Trading Program 
for a period not to exceed 120 days after receipt by the Administrator 
of the complete certification application for the monitoring system 
under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section. Data measured and recorded 
by the provisionally certified monitoring system, in accordance with the 
requirements of part 75 of this chapter, will be considered valid 
quality-assured data (retroactive to the date and time of provisional 
certification), provided that the Administrator does not invalidate the 
provisional certification by issuing a notice of disapproval within 120 
days of the date of receipt of the complete certification application by 
the Administrator.
    (iv) Certification application approval process. The Administrator 
will issue a written notice of approval or disapproval of the 
certification application to the owner or operator within 120 days of 
receipt of the complete certification application under paragraph 
(d)(3)(ii) of this section. In the event the Administrator does not 
issue such a notice within such 120-day period, each monitoring system 
that meets the applicable performance requirements of part 75 of this 
chapter and is included in the certification application will be deemed 
certified for use under the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Annual Trading Program.
    (A) Approval notice. If the certification application is complete 
and shows that each monitoring system meets the applicable performance 
requirements of part 75 of this chapter, then the Administrator will 
issue a written notice of approval of the certification application

    (B) Incomplete application notice. If the certification application 
is not complete, then the Administrator will issue a written notice of 
incompleteness that sets a reasonable date by

[[Page 251]]

which the CAIR designated representative must submit the additional 
information required to complete the certification application. If the 
CAIR designated representative does not comply with the notice of 
incompleteness by the specified date, then the Administrator may issue a 
notice of disapproval under paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(C) of this section. The 
120-day review period shall not begin before receipt of a complete 
certification application.
    (C) Disapproval notice. If the certification application shows that 
any monitoring system does not meet the performance requirements of part 
75 of this chapter or if the certification application is incomplete and 
the requirement for disapproval under paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(B) of this 
section is met, then the Administrator will issue a written notice of 
disapproval of the certification application. Upon issuance of such 
notice of disapproval, the provisional certification is invalidated by 
the Administrator and the data measured and recorded by each uncertified 
monitoring system shall not be considered valid quality-assured data 
beginning with the date and hour of provisional certification (as 
defined under Sec. 75.20(a)(3) of this chapter). The owner or operator 
shall follow the procedures for loss of certification in paragraph 
(d)(3)(v) of this section for each monitoring system that is disapproved

    (a) Whenever any monitoring system fails to meet the quality-
assurance and quality-control requirements or data validation 
requirements of part 75 of this chapter, data shall be substituted using 
the applicable missing data procedures in subpart D or subpart H of, or 
appendix D or appendix E to, part 75 of this chapter.
    (b) Audit decertification. Whenever both an audit of a monitoring 
system and a review of the initial certification or recertification 
application reveal that any monitoring system should not have been 
certified or recertified because it did not meet a particular 
performance specification or other requirement under Sec. 97.171 or the 
applicable provisions of part 75 of this chapter, both at the time of 
the initial certification or recertification application submission and 
at the time of the audit, the Administrator will issue a notice of 
disapproval of the certification status of such monitoring system. For 
the purposes of this paragraph, an audit shall be either a field audit 
or an audit of any information submitted to the permitting authority or 
the Administrator. By issuing the notice of disapproval, the 
Administrator revokes prospectively the certification status of the 
monitoring system. The data measured and recorded by the monitoring 
system shall not be considered valid quality-assured data from the date 
of issuance of the notification of the revoked certification status 
until the date and time that the owner or operator completes 
subsequently approved initial certification or recertification tests for 
the monitoring system. The owner or operator shall follow the applicable 
initial certification or recertification procedures in Sec. 97.171 for 
each disapproved monitoring system.

availability must not be less than 90 percent under subpart HH of this 
part and the unit must be in full compliance with any applicable State 
or Federal emissions or emissions-related requirements.
    (2) To the extent the NO<INF>X</INF> emissions rate and the heat 
input of the unit are monitored and reported in accordance with subpart 
HH of this part for one or more control periods, in addition to the 
control period under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, during which 
control periods monitoring system availability is not less than 90 
percent under subpart HH of this part and the unit is in full compliance 
with any applicable State or Federal emissions or emissions-related 
requirements and which control periods begin not more than 3 years 
before the unit enters the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Annual Trading Program 
under Sec. 97.184(g), such information shall be used as provided in 
paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.
    (c) Baseline heat input. The unit's baseline heat input shall equal:
    (1) If the unit's NO<INF>X</INF> emissions rate and heat input are 
monitored and reported for only one control period, in accordance with 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the unit's total heat input (in mmBtu) 
for the control period; or
    (2) If the unit's NO<INF>X</INF> emissions rate and heat input are 
monitored and reported for more than one control period, in accordance 
with paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, the average of the 
amounts of the unit's total heat input (in mmBtu) for the control 
periods under paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) and (2) of this section.
    (d) Baseline NOX emission rate. The unit's baseline NO<INF>X</INF> 
emission rate shall equal:
    (1) If the unit's NO<INF>X</INF> emissions rate and heat input are 
monitored and reported for only one control period, in accordance with 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the unit's NO<INF>X</INF> emissions 
rate (in lb/mmBtu) for the control period;
    (2) If the unit's NO<INF>X</INF> emissions rate and heat input are 
monitored and reported for more than one control period, in accordance 
with paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, and the unit does not 
have add-on NO<INF>X</INF> emission controls during any such control 
periods, the average of the amounts of the unit's NO<INF>X</INF> 
emissions rate (in lb/mmBtu) for the control periods under paragraphs 
(b)(1)(ii) and (2) of this section; or
    (3) If the unit's NO<INF>X</INF> emissions rate and heat input are 
monitored and reported for more than one control period, in accordance 
with paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, and the unit has add-on 
NO<INF>X</INF> emission controls during any such control periods, the 
average of the amounts of the unit's NO<INF>X</INF> emissions rate (in 
lb/mmBtu) for such control periods during which the unit has add-on

    (e) Issuance of CAIR opt-in permit. After calculating the baseline 
heat input and the baseline NO<INF>X</INF> emissions rate for the unit 
under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section and if the permitting 
authority determines that the CAIR designated representative shows that 
the unit meets the requirements for a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit in 
Sec. 97.180 and meets the elements certified in Sec. 97.183(a)(2), the 
permitting authority will issue a CAIR opt-in permit. The permitting 
authority will provide a copy of the CAIR opt-in permit to the 
Administrator, who will then establish a compliance account for the 
source that includes the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit unless the 
source already has a compliance account.
    (f) Issuance of denial of CAIR opt-in permit. Notwithstanding 
paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section, if at any time before 
issuance of a CAIR opt-in permit for the unit, the permitting authority 
determines that the CAIR designated representative fails to show that 
the unit meets the requirements for a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit in 
Sec. 97.180 or meets the elements certified in Sec. 97.183(a)(2), the 
permitting authority will issue a denial of a CAIR opt-in permit for the 
unit.
    (g) Date of entry into CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Annual Trading Program. A 
unit for which an initial CAIR opt-in permit is issued by the permitting 
authority shall become a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit, and a CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> unit, as of the later of January 1, 2009 or January 1 of 
the first control period during which such CAIR opt-in permit is issued.
    (h) Repowered CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit. (1) If CAIR 
designated representative requests, and the permitting authority issues 
a CAIR opt-in permit providing for, allocation to a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
opt-in unit of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances under Sec. 97.188(c) and 
such unit is repowered after its date of entry into the CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Annual Trading Program under paragraph (g) of this 
section, the repowered unit shall be treated as a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
opt-in unit replacing the original CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit, as 
of the date of start-up of the repowered unit's combustion chamber.
    (2) Notwithstanding paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, as of 
the date of start-up under paragraph (h)(1) of this section, the 
repowered unit shall be deemed to have the same date of commencement of 
operation, date of commencement of commercial operation, baseline heat 
input, and baseline NO<INF>X</INF> emission rate as the original CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit, and the original CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in 
unit shall no longer be treated as a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit or 
a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> unit.

<R05>
Sec. 97.186  Withdrawal from CAIR NOX Annual Trading Program.

    Except as provided under paragraph (g) of this section, a CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit may withdraw from the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
Annual Trading Program, but only if the permitting authority issues a 
notification to the CAIR designated representative of the CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit of the acceptance of the withdrawal of the 
CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit in accordance with paragraph (d) of this 
section.
    (a) Requesting withdrawal. In order to withdraw a CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit from the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Annual Trading 
Program, the CAIR designated representative of the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
opt-in unit shall submit to the permitting authority a request to 
withdraw effective as of midnight of December 31 of a specified calendar 
year, which date must be at least 4 years after December 31 of the year 
of entry into the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Annual Trading Program under Sec. 
97.184(g). The request must be submitted no later than 90 days before 
the requested effective date of withdrawal.
    (b) Conditions for withdrawal. Before a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in 
unit covered by a request under paragraph (a) of this section may 
withdraw from the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Annual Trading Program and the 
CAIR opt-in permit may be terminated under paragraph (e) of this 
section, the following conditions must be met:
    (1) For the control period ending on the date on which the 
withdrawal is to be effective, the source that includes the CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit must meet the requirement to hold CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances under Sec. 97.106(c) and cannot have any 
excess emissions.
    (2) After the requirement for withdrawal under paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section is met, the Administrator will deduct from the compliance 
account of the source that includes the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit 
CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances equal in amount to and allocated for the 
same or a prior control period as any CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances 
allocated to the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit under Sec. 97.188 for 
any control period for which the withdrawal is to be effective. If there 
are no remaining CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> units at the source, the 
Administrator will close the compliance account, and the owners and 
operators of the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit may submit a CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowance transfer for any remaining CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances to another CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Allowance Tracking System in 
accordance with subpart GG of this part.
    (c) Notification. (1) After the requirements for withdrawal under 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section are met (including deduction of 
the full amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances required), the 
permitting authority will issue a notification to the CAIR designated 
representative of the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit of the acceptance 
of the withdrawal of the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit as of midnight 
on December 31 of the calendar year for which the withdrawal was 
requested.
    (2) If the requirements for withdrawal under paragraphs (a) and (b) 
of this section are not met, the permitting authority will issue a 
notification to the CAIR designated representative of the CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit that the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit's 
request to withdraw is denied. Such CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit 
shall continue to be a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit.
    (d) Permit amendment. After the permitting authority issues a 
notification under paragraph (c)(1) of this section that the 
requirements for withdrawal have been met, the permitting authority will 
revise the CAIR permit covering the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit to 
terminate the CAIR opt-in permit for such unit as of the effective date 
specified under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The unit shall 
continue to be a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit until the effective 
date of the termination and shall comply with all requirements under the 
CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Annual Trading Program concerning any control 
periods for which the unit is a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit, even if 
such requirements arise or must be complied with after the withdrawal 
takes effect.
    (e) Reapplication upon failure to meet conditions of withdrawal. If 
the permitting authority denies the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit's 
request to withdraw, the CAIR designated representative may submit 
another request to withdraw in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b) of 
this section.
    (f) Ability to reapply to the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Annual Trading 
Program. Once a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit withdraws from the

[[Page 258]]

CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Annual Trading Program and its CAIR opt-in permit is 
terminated under this section, the CAIR designated representative may 
not submit another application for a CAIR opt-in permit under Sec. 
97.183 for such CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit before the date that is 
4 years after the date on which the withdrawal became effective. Such 
new application for a CAIR opt-in permit will be treated as an initial 
application for a CAIR opt-in permit under Sec. 97.184.
    (g) Inability to withdraw. Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) through 
(f) of this section, a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit shall not be 
eligible to withdraw from the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Annual Trading Program 
if the CAIR designated representative of the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in 
unit requests, and the permitting authority issues a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
opt-in permit providing for, allocation to the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-
in unit of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances under Sec. 97.188(c).


<R05>
Sec. 97.187  Change in regulatory status.

    (a) Notification. If a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit becomes a 
CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> unit under Sec. 97.104, then the CAIR designated 
representative shall notify in writing the permitting authority and the 
Administrator of such change in the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit's 
regulatory status, within 30 days of such change.
    (b) Permitting authority's and Administrator's actions. (1) If a 
CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit becomes a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> unit under 
Sec. 97.104, the permitting authority will revise the CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit's CAIR opt-in permit to meet the requirements 
of a CAIR permit under Sec. 97.123, and remove the CAIR opt-in permit 
provisions, as of the date on which the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit 
becomes a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> unit under Sec. 97.104.
    (2)(i) The Administrator will deduct from the compliance account of 
the source that includes the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit that 
becomes a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> unit under Sec. 97.104, CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances equal in amount to and allocated for the same 
or a prior control period as:
    (A) Any CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances allocated to the CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit under Sec. 97.188 for any control period 
after the date on which the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit becomes a 
CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> unit under Sec. 97.104; and
    (B) If the date on which the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit becomes 
a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> unit under Sec. 97.104 is not December 31, the 
CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances allocated to the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-
in unit under Sec. 97.188 for the control period that includes the date 
on which the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit becomes a CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> unit under Sec. 97.104, multiplied by the ratio of the 
number of days, in the control period, starting with the date on which 
the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit becomes a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> unit 
under Sec. 97.104 divided by the total number of days in the control 
period and rounded to the nearest whole allowance as appropriate.
    (ii) The CAIR designated representative shall ensure that the 
compliance account of the source that includes the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
opt-in unit that becomes a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> unit under Sec. 97.104 
contains the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances necessary for completion of 
the deduction under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.
    (3)(i) For every control period after the date on which the CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit becomes a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> unit under 
Sec. 97.104, the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit will be allocated CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances under Sec. 97.142.
    (ii) If the date on which the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit 
becomes a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> unit under Sec. 97.104 is not December 
31, the following amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances will be 
allocated to the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit (as a CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> unit) under ( 97.142 for the control period that includes 
the date on which the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit becomes a CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> unit under Sec. 97.104:
    (A) The amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances otherwise allocated 
to the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit (as a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> unit) 
under Sec. 97.142 for the control period multiplied by;
    (B) The ratio of the number of days, in the control period, starting 
with the date on which the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit becomes a 
CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> unit under Sec. 97.104, divided by the total number 
of days in the control period; and
    (C) Rounded to the nearest whole allowance as appropriate.

Sec. 97.188  CAIR NOX allowance allocations to CAIR NO<INF>X</INF>
opt-in units.

    (a) Timing requirements. (1) When the CAIR opt-in permit is issued 
under Sec. 97.184(e), the permitting authority will allocate CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances to the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit, and 
submit to the Administrator the allocation for the control period in 
which a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit enters the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
Annual Trading Program under Sec. 97.184(g), in accordance with 
paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.
    (2) By no later than October 31 of the control period after the 
control period in which a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit enters the 
CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Annual Trading Program under Sec. 97.184(g) and 
October 31 of each year thereafter, the permitting authority will 
allocate CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances to the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-
in unit, and submit to the Administrator the allocation for the control 
period that includes such submission deadline and in which the unit is a 
CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit, in accordance with paragraph (b) or (c) 
of this section.
    (b) Calculation of allocation. For each control period for which a 
CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit is to be allocated CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances, the permitting authority will allocate in accordance with 
the following procedures, if provided in a State implementation plan 
revision submitted in accordance with Sec. 51.123(p)(3)(i), (ii), or

determined under Sec. 97.184(c); or
    (ii) The CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit's heat input, as determined 
in accordance with subpart HH of this part, for the immediately prior 
control period, except when the allocation is being calculated for the 
control period in which the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit enters the 
CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Annual Trading Program under Sec. 97.184(g).
    (2) The NO<INF>X</INF> emission rate (in lb/mmBtu) used for 
calculating CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowance allocations will be the lesser 
of:
    (i) The CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit's baseline NO<INF>X</INF> 
emissions rate (in lb/mmBtu) determined under Sec. 97.184(d) and 
multiplied by 70 percent; or
    (ii) The most stringent State or Federal NO<INF>X</INF> emissions 
limitation applicable to the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit at any time 
during the control period for which CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances are 
to be allocated.
    (3) The permitting authority will allocate CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
allowances to the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit in an amount equaling 
the heat input under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, multiplied by the 
NO<INF>X</INF> emission rate under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, 
divided by 2,000 lb/ton, and rounded to the nearest whole allowance as 
appropriate.
    (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section and if the CAIR 
designated representative requests, and the permitting authority issues 
a CAIR opt-in permit (based on a demonstration of the intent to repower 
stated under Sec. 97.183(a)(5)) providing for, allocation to a CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> opt-in unit of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances under this 
paragraph (subject to the conditions in Sec. Sec. 97.184(h) and

CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowance is allocated.


<R05>
Sec. 97.254  Compliance with CAIR SO2 emissions limitation.

    (a) Allowance transfer deadline. The CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances 
are available to be deducted for compliance with a source's CAIR 
SO<INF>2</INF> emissions limitation for a control period in a given 
calendar year only if the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances:
    (1) Were allocated for the control period in the year or a prior 
year; and
    (2) Are held in the compliance account as of the allowance transfer 
deadline for the control period or are transferred into the compliance 
account by a CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowance transfer correctly submitted 
for recordation under Sec. Sec. 97.260 and 97.261 by the allowance 
transfer deadline for the control period.
    (b) Deductions for compliance. Following the recordation, in 
accordance with Sec. 97.261, of CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowance transfers 
submitted for recordation in a source's compliance account by the 
allowance transfer deadline for a control period, the Administrator will 
deduct from the compliance account CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances 
available under paragraph (a) of this section in order to determine 
whether the source meets the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> emissions limitation 
for the control period as follows:
    (1) For a CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> source subject to an Acid Rain 
emissions limitation, the Administrator will, in the following order:
    (i) Deduct the amount of CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances, available 
under paragraph (a) of this section and not issued by a permitting 
authority under Sec. 97.288, that is required under Sec. Sec. 73.35(b) 
and (c) of this part. If there are sufficient CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> 
allowances to complete this deduction, the deduction will be treated as 
satisfying the requirements of Sec. Sec. 73.35(b) and (c) of this 
chapter.
    (ii) Deduct the amount of CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances, not issued 
by a permitting authority under Sec. 97.288, that is required under 
Sec. Sec. 73.35(d) and 77.5 of this part. If there are sufficient CAIR 
SO<INF>2</INF> allowances to complete this deduction, the deduction will 
be treated as satisfying the requirements of Sec. Sec. 73.35(d) and 
77.5 of this chapter.
    (iii) Treating the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances deducted under 
paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section as also being deducted under this 
paragraph (b)(1)(iii), deduct CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances available 
under paragraph (a) of this section (including any issued by a 
permitting authority under Sec. 97.288) in order to determine whether 
the source meets the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> emissions limitation for the 
control period, as follows:
    (A) Until the tonnage equivalent of the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> 
allowances deducted equals, or exceeds in accordance with paragraphs 
(c)(1) and (2) of this section, the number of tons of total sulfur 
dioxide emissions, determined in accordance with subpart HHH of this 
part, from all CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> units at the source for the control 
period; or
    (B) If there are insufficient CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances to 
complete the deductions in paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(A) of this section, 
until no more CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances available under paragraph 
(a) of this section (including any issued by a permitting authority 
under Sec. 97.288) remain in the compliance account.
    (2) For a CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> source not subject to an Acid Rain 
emissions limitation, the Administrator will deduct CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> 
allowances available under paragraph (a) of this section (including any 
issued by a permitting authority under Sec. 97.288) in order to 
determine whether the source meets the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> emissions 
limitation for the control period, as follows:

[[Page 283]]

    (i) Until the tonnage equivalent of the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> 
allowances deducted equals, or exceeds in accordance with paragraphs 
(c)(1) and (2) of this section, the number of tons of total sulfur 
dioxide emissions, determined in accordance with subpart HHH of this 
part, from all CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> units at the source for the control 
period; or
    (ii) If there are insufficient CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances to 
complete the deductions in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, until no 
more CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances available under paragraph (a) of 
this section (including any issued by a permitting authority under Sec. 
97.288) remain in the compliance account.
    (c)(1) Identification of CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances by serial 
number. The CAIR authorized account representative for a source's 
compliance account may request that specific CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> 
allowances, identified by serial number, in the compliance account be 
deducted for emissions or excess emissions for a control period in 
accordance with paragraph (b) or (d) of this section. Such request shall 
be submitted to the Administrator by the allowance transfer deadline for 
the control period and include, in a format prescribed by the 
Administrator, the identification of the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> source and 
the appropriate serial numbers.
    (2) First-in, first-out. The Administrator will deduct CAIR 
SO<INF>2</INF> allowances under paragraph (b) or (d) of this section 
from the source's compliance account, in the absence of an 
identification or in the case of a partial identification of CAIR 
SO<INF>2</INF> allowances by serial number under paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section, on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) accounting basis in the 
following order:
    (i) Any CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances that were allocated to the 
units at the source for a control period before 2010, in the order of 
recordation;
    (ii) Any CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances that were allocated to any 
entity for a control period before 2010 and transferred and recorded in 
the compliance account pursuant to subpart GGG of this part or subpart D 
of part 73 of this chapter, in the order of recordation;
    (iii) Any CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances that were allocated to the 
units at the source for a control period during 2010 through 2014, in 
the order of recordation;
    (iv) Any CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances that were allocated to any 
entity for a control period during 2010 through 2014 and transferred and 
recorded in the compliance account pursuant to subpart GGG of this part 
or subpart D of part 73 of this chapter, in the order of recordation;
    (v) Any CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances that were allocated to the 
units at the source for a control period in 2015 or later, in the order 
of recordation; and
    (vi) Any CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances that were allocated to any 
entity for a control period in 2015 or later and transferred and 
recorded in the compliance account pursuant to subpart GGG of this part 
or subpart D of part 73 of this chapter, in the order of recordation.
    (d) Deductions for excess emissions. (1) After making the deductions 
for compliance under paragraph (b) of this section for a control period 
in a calendar year in which the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> source has excess 
emissions, the Administrator will deduct from the source's compliance 
account the tonnage equivalent in CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances, 
allocated for the control period in the immediately following calendar 
year (including any issued by a permitting authority under Sec. 
97.288), equal to, or exceeding in accordance with paragraphs (c)(1) and 
(2) of this section 3 times the following amount: the number of tons of 
the source's excess emissions minus, if the source is subject to an Acid 
Rain emissions limitation, the amount of the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> 
allowances required to be deducted under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this 
section.
    (2) Any allowance deduction required under paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section shall not affect the liability of the owners and operators of 
the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> source or the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> units at the 
source for any fine, penalty, or assessment, or their obligation to 
comply with any other remedy, for the same violations, as ordered under 
the Clean Air Act or applicable State law.
    (e) Recordation of deductions. The Administrator will record in the 
appropriate compliance account all deductions from such an account under 
paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section and subpart III.

[[Page 284]]

    (f) Administrator's action on submissions. (1) The Administrator may 
review and conduct independent audits concerning any submission under 
the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> Trading Program and make appropriate adjustments 
of the information in the submissions.
    (2) The Administrator may deduct CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances from 
or transfer CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances to a source's compliance 
account based on the information in the submissions, as adjusted under 
paragraph (f)(1) of this section, and record such deductions and 
transfers.

Sec. 97.271  Initial certification and recertification procedures.

    (a) The owner or operator of a CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> unit shall be 
exempt from the initial certification requirements of this section for a 
monitoring system under Sec. 97.270(a)(1) if the following conditions 
are met:
    (1) The monitoring system has been previously certified in 
accordance with part 75 of this chapter; and
    (2) The applicable quality-assurance and quality-control 
requirements of Sec. 75.21 of this chapter and appendix B and appendix 
D to part 75 of this chapter are fully met for the certified monitoring 
system described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (b) The recertification provisions of this section shall apply to a 
monitoring system under Sec. 97.270(a)(1) exempt from initial 
certification requirements under paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) [Reserved]
    (d) Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, the owner 
or operator of a CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> unit shall comply with the 
following initial certification and recertification procedures, for a 
continuous monitoring system (i.e., a continuous emission monitoring 
system and an excepted monitoring system under appendix D to part 75 of 
this chapter) under Sec. 97.270(a)(1). The owner or operator of a unit 
that qualifies to use the low mass emissions excepted monitoring 
methodology under Sec. 75.19 of this chapter or that qualifies to use 
an alternative monitoring system under subpart E of part 75 of this 
chapter shall comply with the procedures in paragraph (e) or (f) of this 
section respectively.
    (1) Requirements for initial certification. The owner or operator 
shall ensure that each continuous monitoring system under Sec. 
97.270(a)(1) (including the automated data acquisition and handling 
system) successfully completes all of the initial certification testing 
required under Sec. 75.20 of this chapter by the applicable deadline in 
Sec. 97.270(b). In addition, whenever the owner or operator installs a 
monitoring system to meet the requirements of this subpart in a location 
where no such monitoring system was previously installed, initial 
certification in accordance with Sec. 75.20 of this chapter is 
required.
    (2) Requirements for recertification. Whenever the owner or operator 
makes a replacement, modification, or change in any certified continuous 
emission monitoring system under Sec. 97.270(a)(1) that may 
significantly affect the ability of the system to accurately measure or 
record SO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions or heat input rate or to meet the 
quality-assurance and quality-control requirements of Sec. 75.21 of 
this chapter or appendix B to part 75 of this chapter, the owner or 
operator shall recertify the monitoring system in accordance with Sec. 
75.20(b) of this chapter. Furthermore, whenever the owner or operator 
makes a replacement, modification, or change to the flue gas handling 
system or the unit's operation that may significantly change the stack 
flow or concentration

[[Page 288]]

profile, the owner or operator shall recertify each continuous emission 
monitoring system whose accuracy is potentially affected by the change, 
in accordance with Sec. 75.20(b) of this chapter. Examples of changes 
to a continuous emission monitoring system that require recertification 
include: replacement of the analyzer, complete replacement of an 
existing continuous emission monitoring system, or change in location or 
orientation of the sampling probe or site. Any fuel flowmeter system 
under Sec. 97.270(a)(1) is subject to the recertification requirements 
in Sec. 75.20(g)(6) of this chapter.
    (3) Approval process for initial certification and recertification. 
Paragraphs (d)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section apply to both initial 
certification and recertification of a continuous monitoring system 
under Sec. 97.270(a)(1). For recertifications, replace the words 
``certification'' and ``initial certification'' with the word 
``recertification'', replace the word ``certified'' with the word 
``recertified,'' and follow the procedures in Sec. Sec. 75.20(b)(5) and 
(g)(7) of this chapter in lieu of the procedures in paragraph (d)(3)(v) 
of this section.
    (i) Notification of certification. The CAIR designated 
representative shall submit to the appropriate EPA Regional Office and 
the Administrator written notice of the dates of certification testing, 
in accordance with Sec. 97.273.
    (ii) Certification application. The CAIR designated representative 
shall submit to the Administrator a certification application for each 
monitoring system. A complete certification application shall include 
the information specified in Sec. 75.63 of this chapter.
    (iii) Provisional certification date. The provisional certification 
date for a monitoring system shall be determined in accordance with 
Sec. 75.20(a)(3) of this chapter. A provisionally certified monitoring 
system may be used under the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> Trading Program for a 
period not to exceed 120 days after receipt by the Administrator of the 
complete certification application for the monitoring system under 
paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section. Data measured and recorded by the 
provisionally certified monitoring system, in accordance with the 
requirements of part 75 of this chapter, will be considered valid 
quality-assured data (retroactive to the date and time of provisional 
certification), provided that the Administrator does not invalidate the 
provisional certification by issuing a notice of disapproval within 120 
days of the date of receipt of the complete certification application by 
the Administrator.
    (iv) Certification application approval process. The Administrator 
will issue a written notice of approval or disapproval of the 
certification application to the owner or operator within 120 days of 
receipt of the complete certification application under paragraph 
(d)(3)(ii) of this section. In the event the Administrator does not 
issue such a notice within such 120-day period, each monitoring system 
that meets the applicable performance requirements of part 75 of this 
chapter and is included in the certification application will be deemed 
certified for use under the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> Trading Program.
    (A) Approval notice. If the certification application is complete 
and shows that each monitoring system meets the applicable performance 
requirements of part 75 of this chapter, then the Administrator will 
issue a written notice of approval of the certification application 
within 120 days of receipt.
    (B) Incomplete application notice. If the certification application 
is not complete, then the Administrator will issue a written notice of 
incompleteness that sets a reasonable date by which the CAIR designated 
representative must submit the additional information required to 
complete the certification application. If the CAIR designated 
representative does not comply with the notice of incompleteness by the 
specified date, then the Administrator may issue a notice of disapproval 
under paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(C) of this section. The 120-day review period 
shall not begin before receipt of a complete certification application.
    (C) Disapproval notice. If the certification application shows that 
any monitoring system does not meet the performance requirements of part 
75 of

[[Page 289]]

this chapter or if the certification application is incomplete and the 
requirement for disapproval under paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(B) of this 
section is met, then the Administrator will issue a written notice of 
disapproval of the certification application. Upon issuance of such 
notice of disapproval, the provisional certification is invalidated by 
the Administrator and the data measured and recorded by each uncertified 
monitoring system shall not be considered valid quality-assured data 
beginning with the date and hour of provisional certification (as 
defined under Sec. 75.20(a)(3) of this chapter). The owner or operator 
shall follow the procedures for loss of certification in paragraph 
(d)(3)(v) of this section for each monitoring system that is disapproved 
for initial certification.
    (D) Audit decertification. The Administrator may issue a notice of 
disapproval of the certification status of a monitor in accordance with 
Sec. 97.272(b).
    (v) Procedures for loss of certification. If the Administrator 
issues a notice of disapproval of a certification application under 
paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(C) of this section or a notice of disapproval of 
certification status under paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(D) of this section, 
then:
    (A) The owner or operator shall substitute the following values, for 
each disapproved monitoring system, for each hour of unit operation 
during the period of invalid data specified under Sec. 
75.20(a)(4)(iii), Sec. 75.20(g)(7), or Sec. 75.21(e) of this chapter 
and continuing until the applicable date and hour specified under Sec. 
75.20(a)(5)(i) or (g)(7) of this chapter:
    (1) For a disapproved SO<INF>2</INF> pollutant concentration monitor 
and disapproved flow monitor, respectively, the maximum potential 
concentration of SO<INF>2</INF> and the maximum potential flow rate, as 
defined in sections 2.1.1.1 and 2.1.4.1 of appendix A to part 75 of this 
chapter.
    (2) For a disapproved moisture monitoring system and disapproved 
diluent gas monitoring system, respectively, the minimum potential 
moisture percentage and either the maximum potential CO<INF>2</INF> 
concentration or the minimum potential O<INF>2</INF> concentration (as 
applicable), as defined in sections 2.1.5, 2.1.3.1, and 2.1.3.2 of 
appendix A to part 75 of this chapter.
    (3) For a disapproved fuel flowmeter system, the maximum potential 
fuel flow rate, as defined in section 2.4.2.1 of appendix D to part 75 
of this chapter.
    (B) The CAIR designated representative shall submit a notification 
of certification retest dates and a new certification application in 
accordance with paragraphs (d)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section.
    (C) The owner or operator shall repeat all certification tests or 
other requirements that were failed by the monitoring system, as 
indicated in the Administrator's notice of disapproval, no later than 30 
unit operating days after the date of issuance of the notice of 
disapproval.
    (e) Initial certification and recertification procedures for units 
using the low mass emission excepted methodology under Sec. 75.19 of 
this chapter. The owner or operator of a unit qualified to use the low 
mass emissions (LME) excepted methodology under Sec. 75.19 of this 
chapter shall meet the applicable certification and recertification 
requirements in Sec. Sec. 75.19(a)(2) and 75.20(h) of this chapter. If 
the owner or operator of such a unit elects to certify a fuel flowmeter 
system for heat input determination, the owner or operator shall also 
meet the certification and recertification requirements in Sec. 
75.20(g) of this chapter.
    (f) Certification/recertification procedures for alternative 
monitoring systems. The CAIR designated representative of each unit for 
which the owner or operator intends to use an alternative monitoring 
system approved by the Administrator under subpart E of part 75 of this 
chapter shall comply with the applicable notification and application 
procedures of Sec. 75.20(f) of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 97.272  Out of control periods.

    (a) Whenever any monitoring system fails to meet the quality-
assurance and quality-control requirements or data validation 
requirements of part 75 of this chapter, data shall be substituted using 
the applicable missing data procedures in subpart D of appendix D to 
part 75 of this chapter.
    (b) Audit decertification. Whenever both an audit of a monitoring 
system and a review of the initial certification or recertification 
application reveal

[[Page 290]]

that any monitoring system should not have been certified or recertified 
because it did not meet a particular performance specification or other 
requirement under Sec. 97.271 or the applicable provisions of part 75 
of this chapter, both at the time of the initial certification or 
recertification application submission and at the time of the audit, the 
Administrator will issue a notice of disapproval of the certification 
status of such monitoring system. For the purposes of this paragraph, an 
audit shall be either a field audit or an audit of any information 
submitted to the permitting authority or the Administrator. By issuing 
the notice of disapproval, the Administrator revokes prospectively the 
certification status of the monitoring system. The data measured and 
recorded by the monitoring system shall not be considered valid quality-
assured data from the date of issuance of the notification of the 
revoked certification status until the date and time that the owner or 
operator completes subsequently approved initial certification or 
recertification tests for the monitoring system. The owner or operator 
shall follow the applicable initial certification or recertification 
procedures in Sec. 97.271 for each disapproved monitoring system.

Sec. 97.284  Opt-in process.

    The permitting authority will issue or deny a CAIR opt-in permit for 
a unit for which an initial application for a CAIR opt-in permit under 
Sec. 97.183 is submitted in accordance with the following, to the 
extent provided in a State implementation plan revision submitted in 
accordance with Sec. 51.124(r)(1), (2), or (3) of this chapter and 
approved by the Administrator:
    (a) Interim review of monitoring plan. The permitting authority and 
the Administrator will determine, on an interim basis, the sufficiency 
of the monitoring plan accompanying the initial application for a CAIR 
opt-in permit under Sec. 97.283. A monitoring plan is sufficient, for 
purposes of interim review, if the plan appears to contain information 
demonstrating that the SO<INF>2</INF> emissions rate and heat input of 
the unit and all other applicable parameters are monitored and reported 
in accordance with subpart HHH of this part. A determination of 
sufficiency shall not be

[[Page 293]]

construed as acceptance or approval of the monitoring plan.
    (b) Monitoring and reporting. (1)(i) If the permitting authority and 
the Administrator determine that the monitoring plan is sufficient under 
paragraph (a) of this section, the owner or operator shall monitor and 
report the SO<INF>2</INF> emissions rate and the heat input of the unit 
and all other applicable parameters, in accordance with subpart HHH of 
this part, starting on the date of certification of the appropriate 
monitoring systems under subpart HHH of this part and continuing until a 
CAIR opt-in permit is denied under Sec. 97.284(f) or, if a CAIR opt-in 
permit is issued, the date and time when the unit is withdrawn from the 
CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> Trading Program in accordance with Sec. 97.286.
    (ii) The monitoring and reporting under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this 
section shall include the entire control period immediately before the 
date on which the unit enters the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> Trading Program 
under Sec. 97.284(g), during which period monitoring system 
availability must not be less than 90 percent under subpart HHH of this 
part and the unit must be in full compliance with any applicable State 
or Federal emissions or emissions-related requirements.
    (2) To the extent the SO<INF>2</INF> emissions rate and the heat 
input of the unit are monitored and reported in accordance with subpart 
HHH of this part for one or more control periods, in addition to the 
control period under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, during which 
control periods monitoring system availability is not less than 90 
percent under subpart HHH of this part and the unit is in full 
compliance with any applicable State or Federal emissions or emissions-
related requirements and which control periods begin not more than 3 
years before the unit enters the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> Trading Program 
under Sec. 97.284(g), such information shall be used as provided in 
paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.
    (c) Baseline heat input. The unit's baseline heat input shall equal:
    (1) If the unit's SO<INF>2</INF> emissions rate and heat input are 
monitored and reported for only one control period, in accordance with 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the unit's total heat input (in mmBtu) 
for the control period; or
    (2) If the unit's SO<INF>2</INF> emissions rate and heat input are 
monitored and reported for more than one control period, in accordance 
with paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, the average of the 
amounts of the unit's total heat input (in mmBtu) for the control 
periods under paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) and (2) of this section.
    (d) Baseline SO2 emission rate. The unit's baseline SO<INF>2</INF> 
emission rate shall equal:
    (1) If the unit's SO<INF>2</INF> emissions rate and heat input are 
monitored and reported for only one control period, in accordance with 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the unit's SO<INF>2</INF> emissions 
rate (in lb/mmBtu) for the control period;
    (2) If the unit's SO<INF>2</INF> emissions rate and heat input are 
monitored and reported for more than one control period, in accordance 
with paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, and the unit does not 
have add-on SO<INF>2</INF> emission controls during any such control 
periods, the average of the amounts of the unit's SO<INF>2</INF> 
emissions rate (in lb/mmBtu) for the control periods under paragraphs 
(b)(1)(ii) and (2) of this section; or
    (3) If the unit's SO<INF>2</INF> emissions rate and heat input are 
monitored and reported for more than one control period, in accordance 
with paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, and the unit has add-on 
SO<INF>2</INF> emission controls during any such control periods, the 
average of the amounts of the unit's SO<INF>2</INF> emissions rate (in 
lb/mmBtu) for such control periods during which the unit has add-on 
SO<INF>2</INF> emission controls.
    (e) Issuance of CAIR opt-in permit. After calculating the baseline 
heat input and the baseline SO<INF>2</INF> emissions rate for the unit 
under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section and if the permitting 
authority determines that the CAIR designated representative shows that 
the unit meets the requirements for a CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit in 
Sec. 97.280 and meets the elements certified in Sec. 97.283(a)(2), the 
permitting authority will issue a CAIR opt-in permit. The permitting 
authority will provide a copy of the CAIR opt-in permit to the 
Administrator, who will then establish a compliance account for the 
source that includes the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit

[[Page 294]]

unless the source already has a compliance account.
    (f) Issuance of denial of CAIR opt-in permit. Notwithstanding 
paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section, if at any time before 
issuance of a CAIR opt-in permit for the unit, the permitting authority 
determines that the CAIR designated representative fails to show that 
the unit meets the requirements for a CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit in 
Sec. 97.280 or meets the elements certified in Sec. 97.283(a)(2), the 
permitting authority will issue a denial of a CAIR opt-in permit for the 
unit.
    (g) Date of entry into CAIR SO2 Trading Program. A unit for which an 
initial CAIR opt-in permit is issued by the permitting authority shall 
become a CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit, and a CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> 
unit, as of the later of January 1, 2010 or January 1 of the first 
control period during which such CAIR opt-in permit is issued.
    (h) Repowered CAIR SO2 opt-in unit. (1) If CAIR designated 
representative requests, and the permitting authority issues a CAIR opt-
in permit providing for, allocation to a CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit 
of CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances under Sec. 97.288(c) and such unit is 
repowered after its date of entry into the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> Trading 
Program under paragraph (g) of this section, the repowered unit shall be 
treated as a CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit replacing the original CAIR 
SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit, as of the date of start-up of the repowered 
unit's combustion chamber.
    (2) Notwithstanding paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, as of 
the date of start-up under paragraph (h)(1) of this section, the 
repowered unit shall be deemed to have the same date of commencement of 
operation, date of commencement of commercial operation, baseline heat 
input, and baseline SO<INF>2</INF> emission rate as the original CAIR 
SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit, and the original CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in 
unit shall no longer be treated as a CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit or 
a CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> unit.

<R05>
Sec. 97.286  Withdrawal from CAIR SO2 Trading Program.

    Except as provided under paragraph (g) of this section, a CAIR 
SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit may withdraw from the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> 
Trading Program, but only if the permitting authority issues a 
notification to the CAIR designated representative of the CAIR 
SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit of the acceptance of the withdrawal of the 
CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit in accordance with paragraph (d) of this 
section.
    (a) Requesting withdrawal. In order to withdraw a CAIR 
SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit from the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> Trading Program, 
the CAIR designated representative of the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in 
unit shall submit to the permitting authority a request to withdraw 
effective as of midnight of

[[Page 295]]

December 31 of a specified calendar year, which date must be at least 4 
years after December 31 of the year of entry into the CAIR 
SO<INF>2</INF> Trading Program under Sec. 97.284(g). The request must 
be submitted no later than 90 days before the requested effective date 
of withdrawal.
    (b) Conditions for withdrawal. Before a CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in 
unit covered by a request under paragraph (a) of this section may 
withdraw from the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> Trading Program and the CAIR opt-
in permit may be terminated under paragraph (e) of this section, the 
following conditions must be met:
    (1) For the control period ending on the date on which the 
withdrawal is to be effective, the source that includes the CAIR 
SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit must meet the requirement to hold CAIR 
SO<INF>2</INF> allowances under Sec. 97.206(c) and cannot have any 
excess emissions.
    (2) After the requirement for withdrawal under paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section is met, the Administrator will deduct from the compliance 
account of the source that includes the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit 
CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances equal in amount to and allocated for the 
same or a prior control period as any CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances 
allocated to the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit under Sec. 97.288 for 
any control period for which the withdrawal is to be effective. If there 
are no remaining CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> units at the source, the 
Administrator will close the compliance account, and the owners and 
operators of the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit may submit a CAIR 
SO<INF>2</INF> allowance transfer for any remaining CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> 
allowances to another CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> Allowance Tracking System in 
accordance with subpart GGG of this part.
    (c) Notification. (1) After the requirements for withdrawal under 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section are met (including deduction of 
the full amount of CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances required), the 
permitting authority will issue a notification to the CAIR designated 
representative of the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit of the acceptance 
of the withdrawal of the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit as of midnight 
on December 31 of the calendar year for which the withdrawal was 
requested.
    (2) If the requirements for withdrawal under paragraphs (a) and (b) 
of this section are not met, the permitting authority will issue a 
notification to the CAIR designated representative of the CAIR 
SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit that the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit's 
request to withdraw is denied. Such CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit 
shall continue to be a CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit.
    (d) Permit amendment. After the permitting authority issues a 
notification under paragraph (c)(1) of this section that the 
requirements for withdrawal have been met, the permitting authority will 
revise the CAIR permit covering the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit to 
terminate the CAIR opt-in permit for such unit as of the effective date 
specified under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The unit shall 
continue to be a CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit until the effective 
date of the termination and shall comply with all requirements under the 
CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> Trading Program concerning any control periods for 
which the unit is a CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit, even if such 
requirements arise or must be complied with after the withdrawal takes 
effect.
    (e) Reapplication upon failure to meet conditions of withdrawal. If 
the permitting authority denies the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit's 
request to withdraw, the CAIR designated representative may submit 
another request to withdraw in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b) of 
this section.
    (f) Ability to reapply to the CAIR SO2 Trading Program. Once a CAIR 
SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit withdraws from the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> 
Trading Program and its CAIR opt-in permit is terminated under this 
section, the CAIR designated representative may not submit another 
application for a CAIR opt-in permit under Sec. 97.283 for such CAIR 
SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit before the date that is 4 years after the 
date on which the withdrawal became effective. Such new application for 
a CAIR opt-in permit will be treated as an initial application for a 
CAIR opt-in permit under Sec. 97.284.
    (g) Inability to withdraw. Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) through 
(f) of this section, a CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit shall not be 
eligible to withdraw from the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> Trading Program if the 
CAIR designated representative of the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit 
requests, and the permitting authority issues a CAIR opt-in permit 
providing for, allocation

[[Page 296]]

to the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit of CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances 
under Sec. 97.288(c).


<R05>
Sec. 97.287  Change in regulatory status.

    (a) Notification. If a CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit becomes a 
CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> unit under Sec. 97.204, then the CAIR designated 
representative shall notify in writing the permitting authority and the 
Administrator of such change in the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit's 
regulatory status, within 30 days of such change.
    (b) Permitting authority's and Administrator's actions. (1) If a 
CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit becomes a CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> unit under 
Sec. 97.204, the permitting authority will revise the CAIR 
SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit's CAIR opt-in permit to meet the requirements 
of a CAIR permit under Sec. 97.223, and remove the CAIR opt-in permit 
provisions, as of the date on which the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit 
becomes a CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> unit under Sec. 97.204.
    (2)(i) The Administrator will deduct from the compliance account of 
the source that includes the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit that 
becomes a CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> unit under Sec. 97.204, CAIR 
SO<INF>2</INF> allowances equal in amount to and allocated for the same 
or a prior control period as:
    (A) Any CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances allocated to the CAIR 
SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit under Sec. 97.288 for any control period 
after the date on which the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit becomes a 
CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> unit under Sec. 97.204; and
    (B) If the date on which the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit becomes 
a CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> unit under Sec. 97.204 is not December 31, the 
CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances allocated to the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-
in unit under Sec. 97.288 for the control period that includes the date 
on which the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit becomes a CAIR 
SO<INF>2</INF> unit under Sec. 97.204, multiplied by the ratio of the 
number of days, in the control period, starting with the date on which 
the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit becomes a CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> unit 
under Sec. 97.204 divided by the total number of days in the control 
period and rounded to the nearest whole allowance as appropriate.
    (ii) The CAIR designated representative shall ensure that the 
compliance account of the source that includes the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> 
opt-in unit that becomes a CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> unit under Sec. 97.204 
contains the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances necessary for completion of 
the deduction under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.

Sec. 97.288  CAIR SO[bdi2] allowance allocations to CAIR SO[bdi2] 
opt-in units.

    (a) Timing requirements. (1) When the CAIR opt-in permit is issued 
under Sec. 97.284(e), the permitting authority will allocate CAIR 
SO<INF>2</INF> allowances to the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit, and 
submit to the Administrator the allocation for the control period in 
which a CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit enters the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> 
Trading Program under Sec. 97.284(g), in accordance with paragraph (b) 
or (c) of this section.
    (2) By no later than October 31 of the control period after the 
control period in which a CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit enters the 
CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> Trading Program under Sec. 97.284(g) and October 31 
of each year thereafter, the permitting authority will allocate CAIR 
SO<INF>2</INF> allowances to the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit, and 
submit to the Administrator the allocation for the control period that 
includes such submission deadline and in which the unit is a CAIR 
SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit, in accordance with paragraph (b) or (c) of 
this section.
    (b) Calculation of allocation. For each control period for which a 
CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit is to be allocated CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> 
allowances, the permitting authority will allocate in accordance with 
the following procedures, if provided in a State implementation plan 
revision submitted in accordance with Sec. 51.124(r)(1), (2), or (3) of 
this chapter and approved by the Administrator:
    (1) The heat input (in mmBtu) used for calculating the CAIR 
SO<INF>2</INF> allowance allocation will be the lesser of:
    (i) The CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit's baseline heat input 
determined under Sec. 97.284(c); or
    (ii) The CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit's heat input, as determined 
in accordance with subpart HHH of this part, for the immediately prior 
control period, except when the allocation is being calculated for the 
control period in which the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit enters the 
CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> Trading Program under Sec. 97.284(g).
    (2) The SO<INF>2</INF> emission rate (in lb/mmBtu) used for 
calculating CAIR SO<INF>2</INF>

[[Page 297]]

allowance allocations will be the lesser of:
    (i) The CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit's baseline SO<INF>2</INF> 
emissions rate (in lb/mmBtu) determined under Sec. 97.284(d) and 
multiplied by 70 percent; or
    (ii) The most stringent State or Federal SO<INF>2</INF> emissions 
limitation applicable to the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit at any time 
during the control period for which CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances are 
to be allocated.
    (3) The permitting authority will allocate CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> 
allowances to the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit with a tonnage 
equivalent equal to, or less than by the smallest possible amount, the 
heat input under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, multiplied by the 
SO<INF>2</INF> emission rate under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and 
divided by 2,000 lb/ton.
    (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section and if the CAIR 
designated representative requests, and the permitting authority issues 
a CAIR opt-in permit (based on a demonstration of the intent to repower 
stated under Sec. 97.283(a)(5)) providing for, allocation to a CAIR 
SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit of CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances under this 
paragraph (subject to the conditions in Sec. Sec. 97.284(h) and 
97.286(g)), the permitting authority will allocate to the CAIR 
SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit as follows, if provided in a State 
implementation plan revision submitted in accordance with Sec. 
51.124(r)(1), (2), or (3) of this chapter and approved by the 
Administrator:
    (1) For each control period in 2010 through 2014 for which the CAIR 
SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit is to be allocated CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> 
allowances,
    (i) The heat input (in mmBtu) used for calculating CAIR 
SO<INF>2</INF> allowance allocations will be determined as described in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (ii) The SO<INF>2</INF> emission rate (in lb/mmBtu) used for 
calculating CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowance allocations will be the lesser 
of:
    (A) The CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit's baseline SO<INF>2</INF> 
emissions rate (in lb/mmBtu) determined under Sec. 97.284(d); or
    (B) The most stringent State or Federal SO<INF>2</INF> emissions 
limitation applicable to the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit at any time 
during the control period in which the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit 
enters the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> Trading Program under Sec. 97.284(g).
    (iii) The permitting authority will allocate CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> 
allowances to the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit with a tonnage 
equivalent equal to, or less than by the smallest possible amount, the 
heat input under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, multiplied by the 
SO<INF>2</INF> emission rate under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, 
and divided by 2,000 lb/ton.
    (2) For each control period in 2015 and thereafter for which the 
CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit is to be allocated CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> 
allowances,
    (i) The heat input (in mmBtu) used for calculating the CAIR 
SO<INF>2</INF> allowance allocations will be determined as described in

emissions rate (in lb/mmBtu) determined under Sec. 97.284(d) multiplied 
by 10 percent; or
    (B) The most stringent State or Federal SO<INF>2</INF> emissions 
limitation applicable to the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit at any time 
during the control period for which CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> allowances are 
to be allocated.
    (iii) The permitting authority will allocate CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> 
allowances to the CAIR SO<INF>2</INF> opt-in unit with a tonnage 
equivalent equal to, or less than by the smallest possible amount, the 
heat input under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, multiplied by the 
SO<INF>2</INF> emission rate under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, 
and divided by 2,000 lb/ton.
    (d) Recordation. If provided in a State implementation plan revision 
submitted in accordance with Sec. 51.124(r)(1), (2), or (3) of this 
chapter and approved by the Administrator:
    (1) The Administrator will record, in the compliance account of the

monitoring, and opt-in provisions for the Federal Clean Air Interstate 
Rule (CAIR) NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season Trading Program, under section 
110 of the Clean Air Act and Sec. 52.35 of this chapter, as a means of 
mitigating interstate transport of ozone and nitrogen oxides.


<R05>
Sec. 97.302  Definitions.

    The terms used in this subpart and subparts BBBB through IIII shall 
have the meanings set forth in this section as follows:
    Account number means the identification number given by the 
Administrator to each CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season Allowance 
Tracking System account.
    Acid Rain emissions limitation means a limitation on emissions of 
sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxides under the Acid Rain Program.
    Acid Rain Program means a multi-state sulfur dioxide and nitrogen 
oxides air pollution control and emission reduction program established 
by the Administrator under title IV of the CAA and parts 72 through 78 
of this chapter.
    Administrator means the Administrator of the United States 
Environmental Protection Agency or the Administrator's duly authorized 
representative.
    Allocate or allocation means, with regard to CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
Ozone Season allowances, the determination by a permitting authority or 
the Administrator of the amount of such CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season 
allowances to be initially credited to a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone 
Season unit, a new unit set-aside, or other entity.
    Allowance transfer deadline means, for a control period, midnight of 
November 30 (if it is a business day), or midnight of the first business 
day thereafter (if November 30 is not a business day), immediately 
following the control period and is the deadline by which a CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowance transfer must be submitted for 
recordation in a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season source's compliance

NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowance allocations under paragraph (b) of 
this section for each CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season unit will be:
    (i) For units commencing operation before January 1, 2001 the 
average of the 3 highest amounts of the unit's adjusted control period 
heat input for 2000 through 2004, with the adjusted control period heat 
input for each year calculated as follows:
    (A) If the unit is coal-fired during the year, the unit's control 
period heat input for such year is multiplied by 100 percent;
    (B) If the unit is oil-fired during the year, the unit's control 
period heat input for such year is multiplied by 60 percent; and
    (C) If the unit is not subject to paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) or (B) of 
this section, the unit's control period heat input for such year is 
multiplied by 40 percent.
    (ii) For units commencing operation on or after January 1, 2001 and 
operating each calendar year during a period of 5 or more consecutive 
calendar years, the average of the 3 highest amounts of the unit's total 
converted control period heat input over the first such 5 years.
    (2)(i) A unit's control period heat input, and a unit's status as 
coal-fired or oil-fired, for a calendar year under paragraph (a)(1)(i) 
of this section, and a unit's total tons of NO<INF>X</INF> emissions 
during a control period in a calendar year under paragraph (c)(3) of 
this section, will be determined in accordance with part 75 of this 
chapter, to the extent the unit was otherwise subject to the 
requirements of part 75 of this chapter for the year, or will be based 
on the best available data reported to the Administrator for the unit 
(in a format prescribed by the Administrator), to the extent the unit 
was not otherwise subject to the requirements of part 75 of this chapter 
for the year.
    (ii) A unit's converted control period heat input for a calendar 
year specified under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section equals:
    (A) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(B) or (C) of this 
section, the control period gross electrical output of the generator or 
generators served by the unit multiplied by 7,900 Btu/kWh, if the unit 
is coal-fired for the year, or 6,675 Btu/kWh, if the unit is not coal-
fired for the year, and divided by 1,000,000 Btu/mmBtu, provided that if 
a generator is served by 2 or more units, then the gross electrical 
output of the generator will be attributed to each unit in proportion to 
the unit's share of the total control period heat input of such units 
for the year;
    (B) For a unit that is a boiler and has equipment used to produce 
electricity and useful thermal energy for industrial, commercial, 
heating, or cooling purposes through the sequential use of energy, the 
total heat energy (in Btu) of the steam produced by the boiler during 
the control period, divided by 0.8 and by 1,000,000 Btu/mmBtu; or
    (C) For a unit that is a combustion turbine and has equipment used 
to produce electricity and useful thermal

[[Page 319]]

energy for industrial, commercial, heating, or cooling purposes through 
the sequential use of energy, the control period gross electrical output 
of the enclosed device comprising the compressor, combustor, and turbine 
multiplied by 3,413 Btu/kWh, plus the total heat energy (in Btu) of the 
steam produced by any associated heat recovery steam generator during 
the control period divided by 0.8, and with the sum divided by 1,000,000 
Btu/mmBtu.
    (iii) Gross electrical output and total heat energy under paragraph 
(a)(2)(ii) of this section will be determined based on the best 
available data reported to the Administrator for the unit (in a format 
prescribed by the Administrator).
    (3) The Administrator will determine what data are the best 
available data under paragraph (a)(2) of this section by weighing the 
likelihood that data are accurate and reliable and giving greater weight 
to data submitted to a governmental entity in compliance with legal 
requirements or substantiated by an independent entity.
    (b)(1) For each control period in 2009 and thereafter, the 
Administrator will allocate to all CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season 
units in a State that have a baseline heat input (as determined under 
paragraph (a) of this section) a total amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
Ozone Season allowances equal to 95 percent for a control period during 
2009 through 2014, and 97 percent for a control period during 2015 and 
thereafter, of the tons of NO<INF>X</INF> emissions in the applicable 
State trading budget under Sec. 97.340 (except as provided in 
paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section).
    (2) The Administrator will allocate CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season 
allowances to each CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season unit under paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section in an amount determined by multiplying the total 
amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances allocated under 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section by the ratio of the baseline heat input 
of such CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season unit to the total amount of 
baseline heat input of all such CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season units 
in the State and rounding to the nearest whole allowance as appropriate.
    (c) For each control period in 2009 and thereafter, the 
Administrator will allocate CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances 
to CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season units in a State that are not 
allocated CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances under paragraph 
(b) of this section because the units do not yet have a baseline heat 
input under paragraph (a) of this section or because the units have a 
baseline heat input but all CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances 
available under paragraph (b) of this section for the control period are 
already allocated, in accordance with the following procedures:
    (1) The Administrator will establish a separate new unit set-aside 
for each control period. Each new unit set-aside will be allocated CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances equal to 5 percent for a control 
period in 2009 through 2014, and 3 percent for a control period in 2015 
and thereafter, of the amount of tons of NO<INF>X</INF> emissions in the 
applicable State trading budget under Sec. 97.340.
    (2) The CAIR designated representative of such a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
Ozone Season unit may submit to the Administrator a request, in a format 
specified by the Administrator, to be allocated CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
Ozone Season allowances, starting with the later of the control period 
in 2009 or the first control period after the control period in which 
the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season unit commences commercial operation 
and until the first control period for which the unit is allocated CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances under paragraph (b) of this 
section. A separate CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowance 
allocation request for each control period for which CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
Ozone Season allowances are sought must be submitted on or before 
February 1 before such control period and after the date on which the 
CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season unit commences commercial operation.
    (3) In a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowance allocation 
request under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the CAIR designated 
representative may request for a control period CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
Ozone Season allowances in an amount not exceeding the CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season unit(s total tons of NO<INF>X</INF> 
emissions during the control period immediately before such control 
period.

[[Page 320]]

    (4) The Administrator will review each CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone 
Season allowance allocation request under paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section and will allocate CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances 
for each control period pursuant to such request as follows:
    (i) The Administrator will accept an allowance allocation request 
only if the request meets, or is adjusted by the Administrator as 
necessary to meet, the requirements of paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this 
section.
    (ii) On or after February 1 before the control period, the 
Administrator will determine the sum of the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone 
Season allowances requested (as adjusted under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of 
this section) in all allowance allocation requests accepted under 
paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section for the control period.
    (iii) If the amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances 
in the new unit set-aside for the control period is greater than or 
equal to the sum under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, then the 
Administrator will allocate the amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone 
Season allowances requested (as adjusted under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of 
this section) to each CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season unit covered by 
an allowance allocation request accepted under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of 
this section.
    (iv) If the amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances in 
the new unit set-aside for the control period is less than the sum under 
paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, then the Administrator will 
allocate to each CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season unit covered by an 
allowance allocation request accepted under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this 
section the amount of the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances 
requested (as adjusted under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section), 
multiplied by the amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances 
in the new unit set-aside for the control period, divided by the sum 
determined under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, and rounded to 
the nearest whole allowance as appropriate.
    (v) The Administrator will notify each CAIR designated 
representative that submitted an allowance allocation request of the 
amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances (if any) allocated 
for the control period to the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season unit 
covered by the request.
    (d) If, after completion of the procedures under paragraph (c)(4) of 
this section for a control period, any unallocated CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
Ozone Season allowances remain in the new unit set-aside under paragraph 
(c) of this section for a State for the control period, the 
Administrator will allocate to each CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season 
unit that was allocated CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances 
under paragraph (b) of this section in the State an amount of CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances equal to the total amount of such 
remaining unallocated CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances, 
multiplied by the unit's allocation under paragraph (b) of this section, 
divided by 95 percent for a control period during 2009 through 2014, and 
97 percent for a control period during 2015 and thereafter, of the 
amount of tons of NO<INF>X</INF> emissions in the applicable State 
trading budget under Sec. 97.340, and rounded to the nearest whole 
allowance as appropriate.
    (e) If the Administrator determines that CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone 
Season allowances were allocated under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section, paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section, or paragraph (d) of 
this section for a control period and that the recipient of the 
allocation is not actually a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season unit under 
Sec. 97.304 in such control period, then the Administrator will notify 
the CAIR designated representative and will act in accordance with the 
following procedures:
    (1) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) or (3) of this section, 
the Administrator will not record such CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season 
allowances under Sec. 97.353.
    (2) If the Administrator already recorded such CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
Ozone Season allowances under Sec. 97.353 and if the Administrator 
makes such determinations before making deductions for the source that 
includes such recipient under Sec. 97.354(b) for the control period, 
then the Administrator will deduct from the account in which such CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances were recorded under Sec. 97.353 
an amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances allocated for 
the same or a prior control

[[Page 321]]

period equal to the amount of such already recorded CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
Ozone Season allowances. The CAIR designated representative shall ensure 
that there are sufficient CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances in 
such account for completion of the deduction.
    (3) If the Administrator already recorded such CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
Ozone Season allowances under Sec. 97.353 and if the Administrator 
makes such determinations after making deductions for the source that 
includes such recipient under Sec. 97.354(b) for the control period, 
then the Administrator will apply paragraph (e)(1) or (2) of this 
section, as appropriate, to any subsequent control period for which CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances were allocated to such recipient.
    (4) The Administrator will transfer the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone 
Season allowances that are not recorded, or that are deducted, in 
accordance with paragraphs (e)(1), (2), and (3) of this section to a new 
unit set-aside for the State in which such recipient is located.

allowances by permitting authority.

    (a) Notwithstanding Sec. Sec. 97.341, 97.342, and 97.353 if a State 
submits, and the Administrator approves, a State implementation plan 
revision in accordance with Sec. 51.123(ee)(2) of this chapter 
providing for allocation of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances 
by the permitting authority, then the permitting authority shall make 
such allocations in accordance with such approved State implementation 
plan revision, the Administrator will not make allocations under 
Sec. Sec. 97.341 and 97.342 for the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season 
units in the State, and under Sec. 97.353, the Administrator will 
record allocations made under such approved State implementation plan 
revision instead of allocations under Sec. Sec. 97.341 and 97.342.
    (b) In implementing paragraph (a) of this section and Sec. Sec. 
97.341, 97.342, and 97.353, the Administrator will ensure that the total 
amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances allocated, under

Program for a period not to exceed 120 days after receipt by the 
Administrator of the complete certification application for the 
monitoring system under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section. Data 
measured and recorded by the provisionally certified monitoring system, 
in accordance with the requirements of part 75 of this chapter, will be 
considered valid quality-assured data (retroactive to the date and time 
of provisional certification), provided that the Administrator does not 
invalidate the provisional certification by issuing a notice of 
disapproval within 120 days of the date of receipt of the complete 
certification application by the Administrator.
    (iv) Certification application approval process. The Administrator 
will issue a written notice of approval or disapproval of the

under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section and if the permitting 
authority determines that the CAIR designated representative shows that 
the unit meets the requirements for a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season 
opt-in unit in Sec. 97.380 and meets the elements certified in Sec. 
97.383(a)(2), the permitting authority will issue a CAIR opt-in permit. 
The permitting authority will provide a copy of the CAIR opt-in permit 
to the Administrator, who will then establish a compliance account for 
the source that includes the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-in 
unit unless the source already has a compliance account.
    (f) Issuance of denial of CAIR opt-in permit. Notwithstanding 
paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section, if at any time before 
issuance of a CAIR opt-in permit for the unit, the permitting authority 
determines that the CAIR designated representative fails to show that 
the unit meets the requirements for a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season 
opt-in unit in Sec. 97.380 or meets the elements certified in Sec. 
97.383(a)(2), the permitting authority will issue a denial of a CAIR 
opt-in permit for the unit.
    (g) Date of entry into CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season Trading 
Program. A unit for which an initial CAIR opt-in permit is

[[Page 338]]

issued by the permitting authority shall become a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
Ozone Season opt-in unit, and a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season unit, 
as of the later of May 1, 2009 or May 1 of the first control period 
during which such CAIR opt-in permit is issued.
    (h) Repowered CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-in unit. (1) If 
CAIR designated representative requests, and the permitting authority 
issues a CAIR opt-in permit providing for, allocation to a CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-in unit of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone 
Season allowances under Sec. 97.388(c) and such unit is repowered after 
its date of entry into the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season Trading 
Program under paragraph (g) of this section, the repowered unit shall be 
treated as a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-in unit replacing the 
original CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-in unit, as of the date of 
start-up of the repowered unit's combustion chamber.
    (2) Notwithstanding paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, as of 
the date of start-up under paragraph (h)(1) of this section, the 
repowered unit shall be deemed to have the same date of commencement of 
operation, date of commencement of commercial operation, baseline heat 
input, and baseline NO<INF>X</INF> emission rate as the original CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-in unit, and the original CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-in unit shall no longer be treated as a 
CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-in unit or a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
Ozone Season unit.

Sec. 97.386  Withdrawal from CAIR NOX Ozone Season Trading Program.

    Except as provided under paragraph (g) of this section, a CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-in unit may withdraw from the CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season Trading Program, but only if the permitting 
authority issues a notification to the CAIR designated representative of 
the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-in unit of the acceptance of 
the withdrawal of the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-in unit in 
accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.
    (a) Requesting withdrawal. In order to withdraw a CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-in unit from the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
Ozone Season Trading Program, the CAIR designated representative of the 
CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-in unit shall submit to the 
permitting authority a request to withdraw effective as of midnight of 
September 30 of a specified calendar year, which date must be at least 4 
years after September 30 of the year of entry into the CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season Trading Program under Sec. 97.384(g). The 
request must be submitted no later than 90 days before the requested 
effective date of withdrawal.
    (b) Conditions for withdrawal. Before a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone 
Season opt-in unit

[[Page 339]]

covered by a request under paragraph (a) of this section may withdraw 
from the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season Trading Program and the CAIR 
opt-in permit may be terminated under paragraph (e) of this section, the 
following conditions must be met:
    (1) For the control period ending on the date on which the 
withdrawal is to be effective, the source that includes the CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-in unit must meet the requirement to 
hold CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances under Sec. 97.306(c) 
and cannot have any excess emissions.
    (2) After the requirement for withdrawal under paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section is met, the Administrator will deduct from the compliance 
account of the source that includes the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season 
opt-in unit CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances equal in amount 
to and allocated for the same or a prior control period as any CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances allocated to the CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-in unit under Sec. 97.388 for any 
control period for which the withdrawal is to be effective. If there are 
no remaining CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season units at the source, the 
Administrator will close the compliance account, and the owners and 
operators of the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-in unit may submit 
a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowance transfer for any remaining 
CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances to another CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season Allowance Tracking System in accordance with 
subpart GGGG of this part.
    (c) Notification. (1) After the requirements for withdrawal under 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section are met (including deduction of 
the full amount of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances 
required), the permitting authority will issue a notification to the 
CAIR designated representative of the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season 
opt-in unit of the acceptance of the withdrawal of the CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-in unit as of midnight on September 30 
of the calendar year for which the withdrawal was requested.
    (2) If the requirements for withdrawal under paragraphs (a) and (b) 
of this section are not met, the permitting authority will issue a 
notification to the CAIR designated representative of the CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-in unit that the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
Ozone Season opt-in unit's request to withdraw is denied. Such CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-in unit shall continue to be a CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-in unit.
    (d) Permit amendment. After the permitting authority issues a 
notification under paragraph (c)(1) of this section that the 
requirements for withdrawal have been met, the permitting authority will 
revise the CAIR permit covering the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season 
opt-in unit to terminate the CAIR opt-in permit for such unit as of the 
effective date specified under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The 
unit shall continue to be a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-in unit 
until the effective date of the termination and shall comply with all 
requirements under the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season Trading Program 
concerning any control periods for which the unit is a CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-in unit, even if such requirements arise 
or must be complied with after the withdrawal takes effect.
    (e) Reapplication upon failure to meet conditions of withdrawal. If 
the permitting authority denies the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season 
opt-in unit's request to withdraw, the CAIR designated representative 
may submit another request to withdraw in accordance with paragraphs (a) 
and (b) of this section.
    (f) Ability to reapply to the CAIR NOX Ozone Season Trading Program. 
Once a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-in unit withdraws from the 
CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season Trading Program and its CAIR opt-in 
permit is terminated under this section, the CAIR designated 
representative may not submit another application for a CAIR opt-in 
permit under Sec. 97.383 for such CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-
in unit before the date that is 4 years after the date on which the 
withdrawal became effective. Such new application for a CAIR opt-in 
permit will be treated as an initial application for a CAIR opt-in 
permit under Sec. 97.384.
    (g) Inability to withdraw. Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) through 
(f) of this section, a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-in unit 
shall not be eligible to withdraw from the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone 
Season Trading Program if the CAIR designated representative of the CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-in unit requests,

[[Page 340]]

and the permitting authority issues a CAIR opt-in permit providing for, 
allocation to the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-in unit of CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances under Sec. 97.388(c).

CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-in unit becomes a CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season unit under Sec. 97.304, multiplied by the 
ratio of the number of days, in the control period, starting with the 
date on which the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season opt-in unit becomes a 
CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season unit under Sec. 97.304 divided by the 
total number of days in the control period and rounded to the nearest 
whole allowance as appropriate.
    (ii) The CAIR designated representative shall ensure that the 
compliance account of the source that includes the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
Ozone Season opt-in unit that becomes a CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season 
unit under Sec. 97.304 contains the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season 
allowances necessary for completion of the deduction under paragraph 
(b)(2)(i) of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 98.1  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This part establishes mandatory greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting 
requirements for owners and operators of certain facilities that 
directly emit GHG as well as for certain fossil fuel suppliers and 
industrial GHG suppliers. For suppliers, the GHGs reported are the 
quantity that would be emitted from combustion or use of the products 
supplied.
    (b) Owners and operators of facilities and suppliers that are 
subject to this part must follow the requirements of this subpart and 
all applicable subparts of this part. If a conflict exists between a 
provision in subpart A and any other applicable subpart, the 
requirements of the applicable subpart shall take precedence.

Sec. 98.2  Who must report?

    (a) The GHG reporting requirements and related monitoring, 
recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of this part apply to the 
owners and operators of any facility that is located in the United 
States or under or attached to the Outer Continental Shelf (as defined 
in 43 U.S.C. 1331) and that meets the requirements of either paragraph 
(a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section; and any supplier that meets 
the requirements of paragraph (a)(4) of this section:
    (1) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in 
Table A-3 of this subpart in any calendar year starting in 2010. For 
these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover stationary fuel 
combustion sources (subpart C of this part), miscellaneous use of 
carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all applicable source 
categories listed in Table A-3 and Table A-4 of this subpart.
    (2) A facility that contains any source category that is listed in 
Table A-4 of this subpart and that emits 25,000 metric tons 
CO<INF>2</INF>e or more per year in combined emissions from stationary 
fuel combustion units, miscellaneous uses of carbonate, and all 
applicable source categories that are listed in Table A-3 and Table A-4 
of this subpart. For these facilities, the annual GHG report must cover 
stationary fuel combustion sources (subpart C of this part), 
miscellaneous use of carbonates (subpart U of this part), and all 
applicable source categories listed in Table A-3 and Table A-4 of this 
subpart.
    (3) A facility that in any calendar year starting in 2010 meets all 
three of the conditions listed in this paragraph (a)(3). For these 
facilities, the annual GHG report must cover emissions from stationary 
fuel combustion sources only.
    (i) The facility does not meet the requirements of either paragraph 
(a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section.
    (ii) The aggregate maximum rated heat input capacity of the 
stationary fuel combustion units at the facility is 30 mmBtu/hr or 
greater.
    (iii) The facility emits 25,000 metric tons CO<INF>2</INF>e or more 
per year in combined

[[Page 365]]

emissions from all stationary fuel combustion sources.
    (4) A supplier that is listed in Table A-5 of this subpart. For 
these suppliers, the annual GHG report must cover all applicable 
products for which calculation methodologies are provided in the 
subparts listed in Table A-5 of this subpart.
    (5) Research and development activities are not considered to be 
part of any source category defined in this part.
    (b) To calculate GHG emissions for comparison to the 25,000 metric 
ton CO<INF>2</INF>e per year emission threshold in paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section, the owner or operator shall calculate annual 
CO<INF>2</INF>e emissions, as described in paragraphs (b)(1) through 
(b)(4) of this section.
    (1) Calculate the annual emissions of CO<INF>2</INF>, 
CH<INF>4</INF>, N<INF>2</INF>O,and each fluorinated GHG in metric tons 
from all applicable source categories listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section. The GHG emissions shall be calculated using the calculation 
methodologies specified in each applicable subpart and available company 
records. Include emissions from only those gases listed in Table A-1 of 
this subpart.
    (2) For each general stationary fuel combustion unit, calculate the 
annual CO<INF>2</INF> emissions in metric tons using any of the four 
calculation methodologies specified in Sec. 98.33(a). Calculate the 
annual CH<INF>4</INF> and N<INF>2</INF>O emissions from the stationary 
fuel combustion sources in metric tons using the appropriate equation in 
Sec. 98.33(c). Exclude carbon dioxide emissions from the combustion of 
biomass, but include emissions of CH<INF>4</INF> and N<INF>2</INF>O from 
biomass combustion.
    (3) For miscellaneous uses of carbonate, calculate the annual 
CO<INF>2</INF> emissions in metric tons using the procedures specified 
in subpart U of this part.
    (4) Sum the emissions estimates from paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), and 
(b)(3) of this section for each GHG and calculate metric tons of 
CO<INF>2</INF>e using Equation A-1 of this section.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR30OC09.000

Where:

CO<INF>2</INF>e = Carbon dioxide equivalent, metric tons/year.
GHG<INF>i</INF> = Mass emissions of each greenhouse gas listed in Table 
A-1 of this subpart, metric tons/year.
GWP<INF>i</INF> = Global warming potential for each greenhouse gas from 
Table A-1 of this subpart.
n = The number of greenhouse gases emitted.

    (5) For purpose of determining if an emission threshold has been 
exceeded, include in the emissions calculation any CO<INF>2</INF> that 
is captured for transfer off site.
    (c) To calculate GHG emissions for comparison to the 25,000 metric 
ton CO<INF>2</INF>e/year emission threshold for stationary fuel 
combustion under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, calculate 
CO<INF>2</INF>, CH<INF>4</INF>, and N<INF>2</INF>O emissions from each 
stationary fuel combustion unit by following the methods specified in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Then, convert the emissions of each 
GHG to metric tons CO<INF>2</INF>e per year using Equation A-1 of this 
section, and sum the emissions for all units at the facility.
    (d) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric 
ton CO<INF>2</INF> per year threshold for importers and exporters of 
coal-to-liquid products under paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, 
calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<INF>2</INF> that would 
result from the complete combustion or oxidation of the quantity of 
coal-to-liquid products that are imported during the reporting year and 
that are exported during the reporting year. Calculate the emissions 
using the methodology specified in subpart LL of this part.
    (e) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric 
ton CO<INF>2</INF>e per year threshold for importers and exporters of 
petroleum products under paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section, calculate 
the mass in metric tons per year of CO<INF>2</INF> that would result 
from the complete combustion or oxidation of the volume of petroleum 
products and natural gas liquids that are imported during the reporting 
year and that are exported during the reporting year. Calculate the 
emissions using the methodology specified in subpart MM of this part.
    (f) To calculate GHG quantities for comparison to the 25,000 metric 
ton

[[Page 366]]

CO<INF>2</INF>e per year threshold under paragraph (a)(4) of this 
section for importers and exporters of industrial greenhouse gases and 
for importers and exporters of CO<INF>2,</INF> the owner or operator 
shall calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<INF>2</INF>e 
imports and exports as described in paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(3) of 
this section.
    (1) Calculate the mass in metric tons per year of CO<INF>2</INF>, 
N<INF>2</INF>O, and each fluorinated GHG that is imported and the mass 
in metric tons per year of CO<INF>2</INF>, N<INF>2</INF>O, and each 
fluorinated GHG that is exported during the year. Include only those 
gases listed in Table A-1 of this subpart.
    (2) Convert the mass of each imported and each GHG exported from 
paragraph (f)(1) of this section to metric tons of CO<INF>2</INF>e using 
Equation A-1 of this section.
    (3) Sum the total annual metric tons of CO<INF>2</INF>e in paragraph 
(f)(2) of this section for all imported GHGs. Sum the total annual 
metric tons of CO<INF>2</INF>e in paragraph (f)(2) of this section for 
all exported GHGs.
    (g) If a capacity or generation reporting threshold in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section applies, the owner or operator shall review the 
appropriate records and perform any necessary calculations to determine 
whether the threshold has been exceeded.
    (h) An owner or operator of a facility or supplier that does not 
meet the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this section is 
not subject to this rule. Such owner or operator would become subject to 
the rule and reporting requirements Sec. 98.3(b)(3), if a facility or 
supplier exceeds the applicability requirements of paragraph (a) of this 
section at a later time. Thus, the owner or operator should reevaluate 
the applicability to this part (including the revising of any relevant 
emissions calculations or other calculations) whenever there is any 
change that could cause a facility or supplier to meet the applicability 
requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. Such changes include but 
are not limited to process modifications, increases in operating hours, 
increases in production, changes in fuel or raw material use, addition 
of equipment, and facility expansion.
    (i) Except as provided in this paragraph, once a facility or 
supplier is subject to the requirements of this part, the owner or 
operator must continue for each year thereafter to comply with all 
requirements of this part, including the requirement to submit annual 
GHG reports, even if the facility or supplier does not meet the 
applicability requirements in paragraph (a) of this section in a future 
year.
    (1) If reported emissions are less than 25,000 metric tons 
CO<INF>2</INF>e per year for five consecutive years, then the owner or 
operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the 
owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that 
announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the 
reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later 
than March 31 of the year immediately following the fifth consecutive 
year of emissions less than 25,000 tons CO<INF>2</INF>e per year. The 
owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under 
Sec. 98.3(g) for each of the five consecutive years and retain such 
records for three years following the year that reporting was 
discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual 
emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons 
CO<INF>2</INF>e per year or more.
    (2) If reported emissions are less than 15,000 metric tons 
CO<INF>2</INF>e per year for three consecutive years, then the owner or 
operator may discontinue complying with this part provided that the 
owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that 
announces the cessation of reporting and explains the reasons for the 
reduction in emissions. The notification shall be submitted no later 
than March 31 of the year immediately following the third consecutive 
year of emissions less than 15,000 tons CO<INF>2</INF>e per year. The 
owner or operator must maintain the corresponding records required under 
Sec. 98.3(g) for each of the three consecutive years and retain such 
records for three years following the year that reporting was 
discontinued. The owner or operator must resume reporting if annual 
emissions in any future calendar year increase to 25,000 metric tons 
CO<INF>2</INF>e per year or more.

[[Page 367]]

    (3) If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such 
that all applicable GHG-emitting processes and operations listed in 
paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section cease to operate, then 
the owner or operator is exempt from reporting in the years following 
the year in which cessation of such operations occurs, provided that the 
owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that 
announces the cessation of reporting and certifies to the closure of all 
GHG-emitting processes and operations. This paragraph (i)(2) does not 
apply to seasonal or other temporary cessation of operations. This 
paragraph (i)(3) does not apply to facilities with municipal solid waste 
landfills or industrial waste landfills, or to underground coal mines. 
The owner or operator must resume reporting for any future calendar year 
during which any of the GHG-emitting processes or operations resume 
operation.
    (j) Table A-2 of this subpart provides a conversion table for some 
of the common units of measure used in part 98.

Sec. 98.3  What are the general monitoring, reporting, recordkeeping
and verification requirements of this part?

    The owner or operator of a facility or supplier that is subject to 
the requirements of this part must submit GHG reports to the 
Administrator, as specified in this section.
    (a) General. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, 
follow the procedures for emission calculation, monitoring, quality 
assurance, missing data, recordkeeping, and reporting that are specified 
in each relevant subpart of this part.
    (b) Schedule. The annual GHG report for reporting year 2010 must be 
submitted no later than September 30, 2011. The annual report for 
reporting years 2011 and beyond must be submitted no later than March 31 
of each calendar year for GHG emissions in the previous calendar year. 
As an example, for a facility or supplier that is subject to the rule in 
calendar year 2011, the annual report must be submitted on March 31, 
2012.
    (1) [Reserved]
    (2) For a new facility or supplier that begins operation on or after 
January 1, 2010 and becomes subject to the rule in the year that it 
becomes operational, report emissions beginning with the first operating 
month and ending on December 31 of that year. Each subsequent annual 
report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 
1 and ending on December 31.
    (3) For any facility or supplier that becomes subject to this rule 
because of a physical or operational change that is made after January 
1, 2010, report emissions for the first calendar year in which the 
change occurs, beginning with the first month of the change and ending 
on December 31 of that year. For a facility or supplier that becomes 
subject to this rule solely because of an increase in hours of operation 
or level of production, the first month of the change is the month in 
which the increased hours of operation or level of production, if 
maintained for the remainder of the year, would cause the facility or 
supplier to exceed the applicable threshold. Each subsequent annual 
report must cover emissions for the calendar year, beginning on January 
1 and ending on December 31.
    (c) Content of the annual report. Except as provided in paragraph 
(d) of this section, each annual GHG report shall contain the following 
information:
    (1) Facility name or supplier name (as appropriate), and physical 
street address of the facility or supplier, including the city, State, 
and zip code.

    (D) N<INF>2</INF>O.
    (E) Each fluorinated GHG (including those not listed in Table A-1 of 
this subpart).
    (d) Special provisions for reporting year 2010.
    (1) Best available monitoring methods. During January 1, 2010 
through March 31, 2010, owners or operators may use best available 
monitoring methods for

[[Page 370]]

any parameter (e.g., fuel use, daily carbon content of feedstock by 
process line) that cannot reasonably be measured according to the 
monitoring and QA/QC requirements of a relevant subpart. The owner or 
operator must use the calculation methodologies and equations in the 
``Calculating GHG Emissions'' sections of each relevant subpart, but may 
use the best available monitoring method for any parameter for which it 
is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required 
piece of monitoring equipment by January 1, 2010. Starting no later than 
April 1, 2010, the owner or operator must discontinue using best 
available methods and begin following all applicable monitoring and QA/
QC requirements of this part, except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2) 
and (d)(3) of this section. Best available monitoring methods means any 
of the following methods specified in this paragraph:
    (i) Monitoring methods currently used by the facility that do not 
meet the specifications of an relevant subpart.
    (ii) Supplier data.
    (iii) Engineering calculations.
    (iv) Other company records.
    (2) Requests for extension of the use of best available monitoring 
methods. The owner or operator may submit a request to the Administrator 
to use one or more best available monitoring methods beyond March 31, 
2010.
    (i) Timing of request. The extension request must be submitted to 
EPA no later than 30 days after the effective date of the GHG reporting 
rule.
    (ii) Content of request. Requests must contain the following 
information:
    (A) A list of specific item of monitoring instrumentation for which 
the request is being made and the locations where each piece of 
monitoring instrumentation will be installed.
    (B) Identification of the specific rule requirements (by rule 
subpart, section, and paragraph numbers) for which the instrumentation 
is needed.
    (C) A description of the reasons why the needed equipment could not 
be obtained and installed before April 1, 2010.
    (D) If the reason for the extension is that the equipment cannot be 
purchased and delivered by April 1, 2010, include supporting 
documentation such as the date the monitoring equipment was ordered, 
investigation of alternative suppliers and the dates by which 
alternative vendors promised delivery, backorder notices or unexpected 
delays, descriptions of actions taken to expedite delivery, and the 
current expected date of delivery.
    (E) If the reason for the extension is that the equipment cannot be 
installed without a process unit shutdown, include supporting 
documentation demonstrating that it is not practicable to isolate the 
equipment and install the monitoring instrument without a full process 
unit shutdown. Include the date of the most recent process unit 
shutdown, the frequency of shutdowns for this process unit, and the date 
of the next planned shutdown during which the monitoring equipment can 
be installed. If there has been a shutdown or if there is a planned 
process unit shutdown between promulgation of this part and April 1, 
2010, include a justification of why the equipment could not be obtained 
and installed during that shutdown.
    (F) A description of the specific actions the facility will take to 
obtain and install the equipment as soon as reasonably feasible and the 
expected date by which the equipment will be installed and operating.
    (iii) Approval criteria. To obtain approval, the owner or operator 
must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it is not 
reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of 
monitoring equipment by April 1, 2010. The use of best available methods 
will not be approved beyond December 31, 2010.
    (3) Abbreviated emissions report for facilities containing only 
general stationary fuel combustion sources. In lieu of the report 
required by paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator of an 
existing facility that is in operation on January 1, 2010 and that meets 
the conditions of Sec. 98.2(a)(3) may submit an abbreviated GHG report 
for the facility for GHGs emitted in 2010. The abbreviated report must 
be submitted by

[[Page 371]]

September 30, 2011. An owner or operator that submits an abbreviated 
report must submit a full GHG report according to the requirements of 
paragraph (c) of this section beginning in calendar year 2012. The 
abbreviated facility report must include the following information:
    (i) Facility name and physical street address including the city, 
state and zip code.
    (ii) The year and months covered by the report.
    (iii) Date of submittal.
    (iv) Total facility GHG emissions aggregated for all stationary fuel 
combustion units calculated according to any method specified in Sec. 
98.33(a) and expressed in metric tons of CO<INF>2,</INF> CH<INF>4,</INF> 
N<INF>2</INF>O, and CO<INF>2</INF>e.
    (v) Any facility operating data or process information used for the 
GHG emission calculations.
    (vi) A signed and dated certification statement provided by the 
designated representative of the owner or operator, according to the 
requirements of paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
    (e) Emission calculations. In preparing the GHG report, you must use 
the calculation methodologies specified in the relevant subparts, except 
as specified in paragraph (d) of this section. For each source category, 
you must use the same calculation methodology throughout a reporting 
period unless you provide a written explanation of why a change in 
methodology was required.
    (f) Verification. To verify the completeness and accuracy of 
reported GHG emissions, the Administrator may review the certification 
statements described in paragraphs (c)(9) and (d)(3)(vi) of this section 
and any other credible evidence, in conjunction with a comprehensive 
review of the GHG reports and periodic audits of selected reporting 
facilities. Nothing in this section prohibits the Administrator from 
using additional information to verify the completeness and accuracy of 
the reports.
    (g) Recordkeeping. An owner or operator that is required to report 
GHGs under this part must keep records as specified in this paragraph. 
Retain all required records for at least 3 years. The records shall be 
kept in an electronic or hard-copy format (as appropriate) and recorded 
in a form that is suitable for expeditious inspection and review. Upon 
request by the Administrator, the records required under this section 
must be made available to EPA. Records may be retained off site if the 
records are readily available for expeditious inspection and review. For 
records that are electronically generated or maintained, the equipment 
or software necessary to read the records shall be made available, or, 
if requested by EPA, electronic records shall be converted to paper 
documents. You must retain the following records, in addition to those 
records prescribed in each applicable subpart of this part:
    (1) A list of all units, operations, processes, and activities for 
which GHG emission were calculated.
    (2) The data used to calculate the GHG emissions for each unit, 
operation, process, and activity, categorized by fuel or material type. 
These data include but are not limited to the following information in 
this paragraph (g)(2):
    (i) The GHG emissions calculations and methods used.
    (ii) Analytical results for the development of site-specific 
emissions factors.
    (iii) The results of all required analyses for high heat value, 
carbon content, and other required fuel or feedstock parameters.
    (iv) Any facility operating data or process information used for the 
GHG emission calculations.
    (3) The annual GHG reports.
    (4) Missing data computations. For each missing data event, also 
retain a record of the cause of the event and the corrective actions 
taken to restore malfunctioning monitoring equipment.
    (5) A written GHG Monitoring Plan.
    (i) At a minimum, the GHG Monitoring Plan shall include the elements 
listed in this paragraph (g)(5)(i).
    (A) Identification of positions of responsibility (i.e., job titles) 
for collection of the emissions data.
    (B) Explanation of the processes and methods used to collect the 
necessary data for the GHG calculations.
    (C) Description of the procedures and methods that are used for 
quality assurance, maintenance, and repair of all

[[Page 372]]

continuous monitoring systems, flow meters, and other instrumentation 
used to provide data for the GHGs reported under this part.
    (ii) The GHG Monitoring Plan may rely on references to existing 
corporate documents (e.g., standard operating procedures, quality 
assurance programs under appendix F to 40 CFR part 60 or appendix B to 
40 CFR part 75, and other documents) provided that the elements required 
by paragraph (g)(5)(i) of this section are easily recognizable.
    (iii) The owner or operator shall revise the GHG Monitoring Plan as 
needed to reflect changes in production processes, monitoring 
instrumentation, and quality assurance procedures; or to improve 
procedures for the maintenance and repair of monitoring systems to 
reduce the frequency of monitoring equipment downtime.
    (iv) Upon request by the Administrator, the owner or operator shall 
make all information that is collected in conformance with the GHG 
Monitoring Plan available for review during an audit. Electronic storage 
of the information in the plan is permissible, provided that the 
information can be made available in hard copy upon request during an 
audit.
    (6) The results of all required certification and quality assurance 
tests of continuous monitoring systems, fuel flow meters, and other 
instrumentation used to provide data for the GHGs reported under this 
part.
    (7) Maintenance records for all continuous monitoring systems, flow 
meters, and other instrumentation used to provide data for the GHGs 
reported under this part.
    (h) Annual GHG report revisions. (1) The owner or operator shall 
submit a revised annual GHG report within 45 days of discovering that an 
annual GHG report that the owner or operator previously submitted 
contains one or more substantive errors. The revised report must correct 
all substantive errors.
    (2) The Administrator may notify the owner or operator in writing 
that an annual GHG report previously submitted by the owner or operator 
contains one or more substantive errors. Such notification will identify 
each such substantive error. The owner or operator shall, within 45 days 
of receipt of the notification, either resubmit the report that, for 
each identified substantive error, corrects the identified substantive 
error (in accordance with the applicable requirements of this part) or 
provide information demonstrating that the previously submitted report 
does not contain the identified substantive error or that the identified 
error is not a substantive error.
    (3) A substantive error is an error that impacts the quantity of GHG 
emissions reported or otherwise prevents the reported data from being 
validated or verified.
    (4) Notwithstanding paragraphs (h)(1) and (h)(2) of this section, 
upon request by the owner or operator, the Administrator may provide 
reasonable extensions of the 45-day period for submission of the revised 
report or information under paragraphs (h)(1) and (h)(2) of this 
section. If the Administrator receives a request for extension of the 
45-day period, by e-mail to an address prescribed by the Administrator, 
at least two business days prior to the expiration of the 45-day period, 
and the Administrator does not respond to the request by the end of such 
period, the extension request is deemed to be automatically granted for 
30 more days. During the automatic 30-day extension, the Administrator 
will determine what extension, if any, beyond the automatic extension is 
reasonable and will provide any such additional extension.
    (5) The owner or operator shall retain documentation for 3 years to 
support any revision made to an annual GHG report.
    (i) Calibration accuracy requirements. The owner or operator of a 
facility or supplier that is subject to the requirements of this part 
must meet the applicable flow meter calibration and accuracy 
requirements of this paragraph (i). The accuracy specifications in this 
paragraph (i) do not apply where either the use of company records (as 
defined in Sec. 98.6) or the use of ``best available information'' is 
specified in an applicable subpart of this part to quantify fuel usage 
and/or other parameters. Further, the provisions of this paragraph

[[Page 373]]

(i) do not apply to stationary fuel combustion units that use the 
methodologies in part 75 of this chapter to calculate CO<INF>2</INF> 
mass emissions.
    (1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (i)(4) through (i)(6) 
of this section, flow meters that measure liquid and gaseous fuel feed 
rates, process stream flow rates, or feedstock flow rates and provide 
data for the GHG emissions calculations shall be calibrated prior to 
April 1, 2010 using the procedures specified in this paragraph (i) when 
such calibration is specified in a relevant subpart of this part. Each 
of these flow meters shall meet the applicable accuracy specification in 
paragraph (i)(2) or (i)(3) of this section. All other measurement 
devices (e.g., weighing devices) that are required by a relevant subpart 
of this part, and that are used to provide data for the GHG emissions 
calculations, shall also be calibrated prior to April 1, 2010; however, 
the accuracy specifications in paragraphs (i)(2) and (i)(3) of this 
section do not apply to these devices. Rather, each of these measurement 
devices shall be calibrated to meet the accuracy requirement specified 
for the device in the applicable subpart of this part, or, in the 
absence of such accuracy requirement, the device must be calibrated to 
an accuracy within the appropriate error range for the specific 
measurement technology, based on an applicable operating standard, 
including but not limited to manufacturer's specifications and industry 
standards. The procedures and methods used to quality-assure the data 
from each measurement device shall be documented in the written 
monitoring plan, pursuant to paragraph (g)(5)(i)(C) of this section.
    (i) All flow meters and other measurement devices that are subject 
to the provisions of this paragraph (i) must be calibrated according to 
one of the following: You may use the manufacturer's recommended 
procedures; an appropriate industry consensus standard method; or a 
method specified in a relevant subpart of this part. The calibration 
method(s) used shall be documented in the monitoring plan required under 
paragraph (g) of this section.
    (ii) For facilities and suppliers that become subject to this part 
after April 1, 2010, all flow meters and other measurement devices (if 
any) that are required by the relevant subpart(s) of this part to 
provide data for the GHG emissions calculations shall be installed no 
later than the date on which data collection is required to begin using 
the measurement device, and the initial calibration(s) required by this 
paragraph (i) (if any) shall be performed no later than that date.
    (iii) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (i)(4) through 
(i)(6) of this section, subsequent recalibrations of the flow meters and 
other measurement devices subject to the requirements of this paragraph 
(i) shall be performed at one of the following frequencies:
    (A) You may use the frequency specified in each applicable subpart 
of this part.
    (B) You may use the frequency recommended by the manufacturer or by 
an industry consensus standard practice, if no recalibration frequency 
is specified in an applicable subpart.
    (2) Perform all flow meter calibration at measurement points that 
are representative of the normal operating range of the meter. Except 
for the orifice, nozzle, and venturi flow meters described in paragraph 
(i)(3) of this section, calculate the calibration error at each 
measurement point using Equation A-2 of this section. The terms ``R'' 
and ``A'' in Equation A-2 must be expressed in consistent units of 
measure (e.g., gallons/minute, ft\3\/min). The calibration error at each 
measurement point shall not exceed 5.0 percent of the reference value.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17DE10.000


[[Page 374]]


Where:

CE = Calibration error (%).
R = Reference value.
A = Flow meter response to the reference value.

    (3) For orifice, nozzle, and venturi flow meters, the initial 
quality assurance consists of in-situ calibration of the differential 
pressure (delta-P), total pressure, and temperature transmitters.
    (i) Calibrate each transmitter at a zero point and at least one 
upscale point. Fixed reference points, such as the freezing point of 
water, may be used for temperature transmitter calibrations. Calculate 
the calibration error of each transmitter at each measurement point, 
using Equation A-3 of this subpart. The terms ``R,'' ``A,'' and ``FS'' 
in Equation A-3 of this subpart must be in consistent units of measure 
(e.g., milliamperes, inches of water, psi, degrees). For each 
transmitter, the CE value at each measurement point shall not exceed 2.0 
percent of full-scale. Alternatively, the results are acceptable if the 
sum of the calculated CE values for the three transmitters at each 
calibration level (i.e., at the zero level and at each upscale level) 
does not exceed 6.0 percent.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17DE10.001

Where:
CE = Calibration error (%).
R = Reference value.
A = Transmitter response to the reference value.
FS = Full-scale value of the transmitter.

    (ii) In cases where there are only two transmitters (i.e., 
differential pressure and either temperature or total pressure) in the 
immediate vicinity of the flow meter's primary element (e.g., the 
orifice plate), or when there is only a differential pressure 
transmitter in close proximity to the primary element, calibration of 
these existing transmitters to a CE of 2.0 percent or less at each 
measurement point is still required, in accordance with paragraph 
(i)(3)(i) of this section; alternatively, when two transmitters are 
calibrated, the results are acceptable if the sum of the CE values for 
the two transmitters at each calibration level does not exceed 4.0 
percent. However, note that installation and calibration of an 
additional transmitter (or transmitters) at the flow monitor location to 
measure temperature or total pressure or both is not required in these 
cases. Instead, you may use assumed values for temperature and/or total 
pressure, based on measurements of these parameters at a remote location 
(or locations), provided that the following conditions are met:
    (A) You must demonstrate that measurements at the remote location(s) 
can, when appropriate correction factors are applied, reliably and 
accurately represent the actual temperature or total pressure at the 
flow meter under all expected ambient conditions.
    (B) You must make all temperature and/or total pressure measurements 
in the demonstration described in paragraph (i)(3)(ii)(A) of this 
section with calibrated gauges, sensors, transmitters, or other 
appropriate measurement devices. At a minimum, calibrate each of these 
devices to an accuracy within the appropriate error range for the 
specific measurement technology, according to one of the following. You 
may calibrate using a manufacturer's specification or an industry 
consensus standard.
    (C) You must document the methods used for the demonstration 
described in paragraph (i)(3)(ii)(A) of this section in the written GHG 
Monitoring Plan under paragraph (g)(5)(i)(C) of this section. You must 
also include the data from the demonstration, the mathematical 
correlation(s) between the remote readings and actual flow meter 
conditions derived from the data, and any supporting engineering 
calculations in the GHG Monitoring Plan. You must maintain all of this 
information

[[Page 375]]

in a format suitable for auditing and inspection.
    (D) You must use the mathematical correlation(s) derived from the 
demonstration described in paragraph (i)(3)(ii)(A) of this section to 
convert the remote temperature or the total pressure readings, or both, 
to the actual temperature or total pressure at the flow meter, or both, 
on a daily basis. You shall then use the actual temperature and total 
pressure values to correct the measured flow rates to standard 
conditions.
    (E) You shall periodically check the correlation(s) between the 
remote and actual readings (at least once a year), and make any 
necessary adjustments to the mathematical relationship(s).
    (4) Fuel billing meters are exempted from the calibration 
requirements of this section and from the GHG Monitoring Plan and 
recordkeeping provisions of paragraphs (g)(5)(i)(C), (g)(6), and (g)(7) 
of this section, provided that the fuel supplier and any unit combusting 
the fuel do not have any common owners and are not owned by subsidiaries 
or affiliates of the same company. Meters used exclusively to measure 
the flow rates of fuels that are used for unit startup are also exempted 
from the calibration requirements of this section.
    (5) For a flow meter that has been previously calibrated in 
accordance with paragraph (i)(1) of this section, an additional 
calibration is not required by the date specified in paragraph (i)(1) of 
this section if, as of that date, the previous calibration is still 
active (i.e., the device is not yet due for recalibration because the 
time interval between successive calibrations has not elapsed). In this 
case, the deadline for the successive calibrations of the flow meter 
shall be set according to one of the following. You may use either the 
manufacturer's recommended calibration schedule or you may use the 
industry consensus calibration schedule.
    (6) For units and processes that operate continuously with 
infrequent outages, it may not be possible to meet the April 1, 2010 
deadline for the initial calibration of a flow meter or other 
measurement device without disrupting normal process operation. In such 
cases, the owner or operator may postpone the initial calibration until 
the next scheduled maintenance outage. The best available information 
from company records may be used in the interim. The subsequent required 
recalibrations of the flow meters may be similarly postponed. Such 
postponements shall be documented in the monitoring plan that is 
required under paragraph (g)(5) of this section.
    (7) If the results of an initial calibration or a recalibration fail 
to meet the required accuracy specification, data from the flow meter 
shall be considered invalid, beginning with the hour of the failed 
calibration and continuing until a successful calibration is completed. 
You shall follow the missing data provisions provided in the relevant 
missing data sections during the period of data invalidation.
    (j) Measurement device installation--(1) General. If an owner or 
operator required to report under subpart P, subpart X or subpart Y of 
this part has process equipment or units that operate continuously and 
it is not possible to install a required flow meter or other measurement 
device by April 1, 2010, (or by any later date in 2010 approved by the 
Administrator as part of an extension of best available monitoring 
methods per paragraph (d) of this section) without process equipment or 
unit shutdown, or through a hot tap, the owner or operator may request 
an extension from the Administrator to delay installing the measurement 
device until the next scheduled process equipment or unit shutdown. If 
approval for such an extension is granted by the Administrator, the 
owner or operator must use best available monitoring methods during the 
extension period.
    (2) Requests for extension of the use of best available monitoring 
methods for measurement device installation. The owner or operator must 
first provide the Administrator an initial notification of the intent to 
submit an extension request for use of best available monitoring methods 
beyond December 31, 2010 (or an earlier date approved by EPA) in cases 
where measurement device installation would require a process equipment 
or unit shutdown, or could only be done through a hot tap. The owner or 
operator must follow-up

[[Page 376]]

this initial notification with the complete extension request containing 
the information specified in paragraph (j)(4) of this section.
    (3) Timing of request. (i) The initial notice of intent must be 
submitted no later than January 1, 2011, or by the end of the approved 
use of best available monitoring methods extension in 2010, whichever is 
earlier. The completed extension request must be submitted to the 
Administrator no later than February 15, 2011.
    (ii) Any subsequent extensions to the original request must be 
submitted to the Administrator within 4 weeks of the owner or operator 
identifying the need to extend the request, but in any event no later 
than 4 weeks before the date for the planned process equipment or unit 
shutdown that was provided in the original request.
    (4) Content of the request. Requests must contain the following 
information:
    (i) Specific measurement device for which the request is being made 
and the location where each measurement device will be installed.
    (ii) Identification of the specific rule requirements (by rule 
subpart, section, and paragraph numbers) requiring the measurement 
device.
    (iii) A description of the reasons why the needed equipment could 
not be installed before April 1, 2010, or by the expiration date for the 
use of best available monitoring methods, in cases where an extension 
has been granted under Sec. 98.3(d).
    (iv) Supporting documentation showing that it is not practicable to 
isolate the process equipment or unit and install the measurement device 
without a full shutdown or a hot tap, and that there was no opportunity 
during 2010 to install the device. Include the date of the three most 
recent shutdowns for each relevant process equipment or unit, the 
frequency of shutdowns for each relevant process equipment or unit, and 
the date of the next planned process equipment or unit shutdown.
    (v) Include a description of the proposed best available monitoring 
method for estimating GHG emissions during the time prior to 
installation of the meter.
    (5) Approval criteria. The owner or operator must demonstrate to the 
Administrator's satisfaction that it is not reasonably feasible to 
install the measurement device before April 1, 2010 (or by the 
expiration date for the use of best available monitoring methods, in 
cases where an extension has been granted under paragraph (d) of this 
section) without a process equipment or unit shutdown, or through a hot 
tap, and that the proposed method for estimating GHG emissions during 
the time before which the measurement device will be installed is 
appropriate. The Administrator will not initially approve the use of the 
proposed best available monitoring method past December 31, 2013.
    (6) Measurement device installation deadline. Any owner or operator 
that submits both a timely initial notice of intent and a timely 
completed extension request under paragraph (j)(3) of this section to 
extend use of best available monitoring methods for measurement device 
installation must install all such devices by July 1, 2011 unless the 
extension request under this paragraph (j) is approved by the 
Administrator before July 1, 2011.
    (7) One time extension past December 31, 2013. If an owner or 
operator determines that a scheduled process equipment or unit shutdown 
will not occur by December 31, 2013, the owner or operator may re-apply 
to use best available monitoring methods for one additional time period, 
not to extend beyond December 31, 2015. To extend use of best available 
monitoring methods past December 31, 2013, the owner or operator must 
submit a new extension request by June 1, 2013 that contains the 
information required in paragraph (j)(4) of this section. The owner or 
operator must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it 
continues to not be reasonably feasible to install the measurement 
device before December 31, 2013 without a process equipment or unit 
shutdown, or that installation of the measurement device could only be 
done through a hot tap, and that the proposed method for estimating GHG 
emissions during the time before which the measurement device will be 
installed is appropriate. An

[[Page 377]]

owner or operator that submits a request under this paragraph to extend 
use of best available monitoring methods for measurement device 
installation must install all such devices by December 31, 2013, unless 
the extension request under this paragraph is approved by the 
Administrator.

<R05>
Sec. 98.4  Authorization and responsibilities of the designated
representative.

    (a) General. Except as provided under paragraph (f) of this section, 
each facility, and each supplier, that is subject to this part, shall 
have one and only one designated representative, who shall be 
responsible for certifying, signing, and submitting GHG emissions 
reports and any other submissions for such facility and supplier 
respectively to the Administrator under this part. If the facility is 
required under any other part of title 40 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations to submit to the Administrator any other emission report 
that is subject to any requirement in 40 CFR part 75, the same 
individual shall be the designated representative responsible for 
certifying, signing, and submitting the GHG emissions reports and all 
such other emissions reports under this part.
    (b) Authorization of a designated representative. The designated 
representative of the facility or supplier shall be an individual 
selected by an agreement binding on the owners and operators of such 
facility or supplier and shall act in accordance with the certification 
statement in paragraph (i)(4)(iv) of this section.
    (c) Responsibility of the designated representative. Upon receipt by 
the Administrator of a complete certificate of representation under this 
section for a facility or supplier, the designated representative 
identified in such certificate of representation shall represent and, by 
his or her representations, actions, inactions, or submissions, legally 
bind each owner and operator of such facility or supplier in all matters 
pertaining to this part, notwithstanding any agreement between the 
designated representative and such owners and operators. The owners and 
operators shall be bound by any decision or order issued to the 
designated representative by the Administrator or a court.
    (d) Timing. No GHG emissions report or other submissions under this 
part for a facility or supplier will be accepted until the Administrator 
has received a complete certificate of representation under this section 
for a designated representative of the facility or supplier. Such 
certificate of representation shall be submitted at least 60 days before 
the deadline for submission of the facility's or supplier's initial 
emission report under this part.
    (e) Certification of the GHG emissions report. Each GHG emission 
report and any other submission under this part for a facility or

variety of remedial operations on producing petroleum and natural gas 
wells to try to increase production. This process also includes high-
rate flowback of injected gas, water, oil, and proppant used to re-
fracture and prop-open new fractures in existing low permeability gas 
reservoirs, steps that may vent large quantities of produced gas to the 
atmosphere.
    Wellhead means the piping, casing, tubing and connected valves 
protruding above the earth's surface for an oil and/or natural gas well. 
The wellhead ends where the flow line connects to a wellhead valve. 
Wellhead equipment includes all equipment, permanent and portable, 
located on the improved land area (i.e. well pad) surrounding one or 
multiple wellheads.
    Wet natural gas means natural gas in which water vapor exceeds the 
concentration specified for commercially saleable natural gas delivered 
from transmission and distribution pipelines. This input stream to a 
natural gas dehydrator is referred to as ``wet gas.''
    Wood residuals means materials recovered from three principal 
sources: Municipal solid waste (MSW); construction and demolition 
debris; and primary timber processing. Wood residuals recovered from MSW 
include wooden furniture, cabinets, pallets and containers, scrap lumber 
(from sources other than construction and demolition activities), and 
urban tree and landscape residues. Wood residuals from construction and 
demolition debris originate from the construction, repair, remodeling 
and demolition of houses and non-residential structures. Wood residuals 
from primary timber processing include bark, sawmill slabs and edgings, 
sawdust, and peeler log

[[Page 401]]

cores. Other sources of wood residuals include, but are not limited to, 
railroad ties, telephone and utility poles, pier and dock timbers, 
wastewater process sludge from paper mills, trim, sander dust, and 
sawdust from wood products manufacturing (including resinated wood 
product residuals), and logging residues.
    Wool fiberglass means fibrous glass of random texture, including 
fiberglass insulation, and other products listed in NAICS 327993.
    Working capacity, for the purposes of subpart TT of this part, means 
the maximum volume or mass of waste that is actually placed in the 
landfill from an individual or representative type of container (such as 
a tank, truck, or roll-off bin) used to convey wastes to the landfill, 
taking into account that the container may not be able to be 100 percent 
filled and/or 100 percent emptied for each load.
    You means an owner or operator subject to Part 98.
    Zinc smelters means a facility engaged in the production of zinc 
metal, zinc oxide, or zinc alloy products from zinc sulfide ore 
concentrates, zinc calcine, or zinc-bearing scrap and recycled materials 
through the use of pyrometallurgical techniques involving the reduction 
and volatization of zinc-bearing feed materials charged to a furnace.

          Subpart C_General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources


<R05>
Sec. 98.30  Definition of the source category.

    (a) Stationary fuel combustion sources are devices that combust 
solid, liquid, or gaseous fuel, generally for the purposes of producing 
electricity, generating steam, or providing useful heat or energy for 
industrial, commercial, or institutional use, or reducing the volume of 
waste by removing combustible matter. Stationary fuel combustion sources 
include, but are not limited to, boilers, simple and combined-cycle 
combustion turbines, engines, incinerators, and process heaters.
    (b) This source category does not include:
    (1) Portable equipment, as defined in Sec. 98.6.
    (2) Emergency generators and emergency equipment, as defined in 
Sec. 98.6.
    (3) Irrigation pumps at agricultural operations.
    (4) Flares, unless otherwise required by provisions of another 
subpart of this

[[Page 414]]

part to use methodologies in this subpart.
    (5) Electricity generating units that are subject to subpart D of 
this part.
    (c) For a unit that combusts hazardous waste (as defined in Sec. 
261.3 of this chapter), reporting of GHG emissions is not required 
unless either of the following conditions apply:
    (1) Continuous emission monitors (CEMS) are used to quantify 
CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions.
    (2) Any fuel listed in Table C-1 of this subpart is also combusted 
in the unit. In this case, report GHG emissions from combustion of all 
fuels listed in Table C-1 of this subpart.
    (d) You are not required to report GHG emissions from pilot lights. 
A pilot light is a small auxiliary flame that ignites the burner of a 
combustion device when the control valve opens.

<R05>
Sec. 98.31  Reporting threshold.

    You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility 
contains one or more stationary fuel combustion sources and the facility 
meets the applicability requirements of either Sec. Sec. 98.2(a)(1), 
98.2(a)(2), or 98.2(a)(3).


<R05>
Sec. 98.32  GHGs to report.

chapter, as described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section. For units 
that combust both biomass and fossil fuels, you must calculate and 
report CO<INF>2</INF> emissions from the combustion of biomass 
separately using the methods in paragraph (e) of this section, except as 
otherwise provided in paragraphs (a)(5)(iv) and (e) of this section and 
in Sec. 98.36(d).

sampling frequency, the annual average HHV shall either be computed 
according to paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(A) of this section or as the 
arithmetic average HHV for all values for the year (including valid 
samples and substitute data values under Sec. 98.35).
    (iii) For units that combust municipal solid waste (MSW) and that 
produce steam, use Equation C-2c of this section. Equation C-2c of this 
section may also be used for any other solid fuel listed in Table C-1 of 
this subpart provided that steam is generated by the unit.

the density using one of the following appropriate methods. You may use 
a method published by a consensus-based standards organization, if such 
a method exists, or you may use industry standard practice. Consensus-
based standards organizations include, but are not limited to, the 
following: ASTM International (100 Barr Harbor Drive, P.O. Box CB700, 
West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania 19428-B2959, (800) 262-1373, http://

York, NY 10016-5990, (800) 843-2763, http://www.asme.org), the American

documented in the GHG Monitoring Plan required under Sec. 98.3(g)(5).
    (v) The following default density values may be used for fuel oil, 
in lieu of using the methods in paragraph (a)(3)(iv) of this section: 
6.8 lb/gal for No. 1 oil; 7.2 lb/gal for No. 2 oil; 8.1 lb/gal for No. 6 
oil.
    (4) Tier 4 Calculation Methodology. Calculate the annual 
CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions from all fuels combusted in a unit, by 
using quality-assured data from continuous emission monitoring systems 
(CEMS).
    (i) This methodology requires a CO<INF>2</INF> concentration monitor 
and a stack gas volumetric flow rate monitor, except as otherwise 
provided in paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section. Hourly measurements of 
CO<INF>2</INF> concentration and stack gas flow rate are converted to 
CO<INF>2</INF> mass emission rates in metric tons per hour.
    (ii) When the CO<INF>2</INF> concentration is measured on a wet 
basis, Equation C-6 of this section is used to calculate the hourly 
CO<INF>2</INF> emission rates:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR30OC09.011

Where:

CO<INF>2</INF> = CO<INF>2</INF> mass emission rate (metric tons/hr).
C<INF>CO2</INF> = Hourly average CO<INF>2</INF> concentration (% 
CO<INF>2</INF>).
Q = Hourly average stack gas volumetric flow rate (scfh).
5.18 x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> = Conversion factor (metric tons/scf/% 
CO<INF>2</INF>).

    (iii) If the CO<INF>2</INF> concentration is measured on a dry 
basis, a correction for the stack gas moisture content is required. You 
shall either continuously monitor the stack gas moisture content using a 
method described in Sec. 75.11(b)(2) of this chapter or use an 
appropriate default moisture percentage. For coal, wood, and natural gas 
combustion, you may use the default moisture values specified in Sec. 
75.11(b)(1) of this chapter. Alternatively, for any type of fuel, you 
may determine an appropriate site-specific default moisture value (or 
values), using measurements made with EPA Method 4--Determination Of 
Moisture Content In Stack Gases, in appendix A-3 to part 60 of this 
chapter. Moisture data from the relative accuracy test audit (RATA) of a 
CEMS may be used for this purpose. If this option is selected, the site-
specific moisture default value(s) must represent the fuel(s) or fuel 
blends that are combusted in the unit during normal, stable operation, 
and must account for any distinct difference(s) in the stack gas 
moisture content associated with different process operating conditions. 
For each site-specific default moisture percentage, at least nine Method 
4 runs are required, except where the option to use moisture data from a 
RATA is selected, and the applicable regulation allows a single moisture 
determination to represent two or more RATA runs. In that case, you may 
base the site-specific moisture percentage on the number of moisture 
runs allowed by the RATA regulation. Calculate each site-specific 
default moisture value by taking the arithmetic average of the Method 4 
runs. Each site-specific moisture default value shall be updated 
whenever the owner or operator believes the current value is non-
representative, due to changes in unit or process operation, but in any 
event no less frequently than annually. Use the updated moisture value 
in the subsequent CO<INF>2</INF> emissions calculations. For each unit 
operating hour, a moisture correction must be applied to Equation C-6 of 
this section as follows:

[[Page 419]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17DE10.002

Where:

CO<INF>2</INF>* = Hourly CO<INF>2</INF> mass emission rate, corrected 
          for moisture (metric tons/hr).
CO<INF>2</INF> = Hourly CO<INF>2</INF> mass emission rate from Equation 
          C-6 of this section, uncorrected (metric tons/hr).
%H<INF>2</INF>O = Hourly moisture percentage in the stack gas (measured 
          or default value, as appropriate).

    (iv) An oxygen (O<INF>2</INF>) concentration monitor may be used in 
lieu of a CO<INF>2</INF> concentration monitor to determine the hourly 
CO<INF>2</INF> concentrations, in accordance with Equation F-14a or F-
14b (as applicable) in appendix F to part 75 of this chapter, if the 
effluent gas stream monitored by the CEMS consists solely of combustion 
products (i.e., no process CO<INF>2</INF> emissions or CO<INF>2</INF> 
emissions from sorbent are mixed with the combustion products) and if 
only fuels that are listed in Table 1 in section 3.3.5 of appendix F to 
part 75 of this chapter are combusted in the unit. If the O<INF>2</INF> 
monitoring option is selected, the F-factors used in Equations F-14a and 
F-14b shall be determined according to section 3.3.5 or section 3.3.6 of 
appendix F to part 75 of this chapter, as applicable. If Equation F-14b 
is used, the hourly moisture percentage in the stack gas shall be 
determined in accordance with paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section.
    (v) Each hourly CO<INF>2</INF> mass emission rate from Equation C-6 
or C-7 of this section is multiplied by the operating time to convert it 
from metric tons per hour to metric tons. The operating time is the 
fraction of the hour during which fuel is combusted (e.g., the unit 
operating time is 1.0 if the unit operates for the whole hour and is 0.5 
if the unit operates for 30 minutes in the hour). For common stack 
configurations, the operating time is the fraction of the hour during 
which effluent gases flow through the common stack.
    (vi) The hourly CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions are then summed over 
each calendar quarter and the quarterly totals are summed to determine 
the annual CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions.
    (vii) If both biomass and fossil fuel are combusted during the year, 
determine and report the biogenic CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions 
separately, as described in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (viii) If a portion of the flue gases generated by a unit subject to 
Tier 4 (e.g., a slip stream) is continuously diverted from the main flue 
gas exhaust system for the purpose of heat recovery or some other 
similar process, and then exhausts through a stack that is not equipped 
with the continuous emission monitors to measure CO<INF>2</INF> mass 
emissions, CO<INF>2</INF> emissions shall be determined as follows:
    (A) At least once a year, use EPA Methods 2 and 3A, and (if 
necessary) Method 4 in appendices A-2 and A-3 to part 60 of this chapter 
to perform emissions testing at a set point that best represents normal, 
stable process operating conditions. A minimum of three one-hour Method 
3A tests are required, to determine the CO<INF>2</INF> concentration. A 
Method 2 test shall be performed during each Method 3A run, to determine 
the stack gas volumetric flow rate. If moisture correction is necessary, 
a Method 4 run shall also be performed during each Method 3A run. 
Important parametric information related to the stack gas flow rate 
(e.g., damper positions, fan settings, etc.) shall also be recorded 
during the test.
    (B) Calculate a CO<INF>2</INF> mass emission rate (in metric tons/
hr) from the stack test data, using a version of Equation C-6 in 
paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section, modified as follows. In the 
Equation C-6 nomenclature, replace the words ``Hourly average'' in the 
definitions of ``C<INF>CO2</INF>'' and ``Q'' with the words ``3-run 
average''. Substitute the arithmetic average values of CO<INF>2</INF> 
concentration and stack gas flow rate from the emission testing into 
modified Equation C-6. If CO<INF>2</INF> is measured on a dry basis, a 
moisture correction of the calculated CO<INF>2</INF> mass emission rate 
is required. Use Equation C-7 in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section to 
make this correction; replace the word ``Hourly''

[[Page 420]]

with the words ``3-run average'' in the equation nomenclature.
    (C) The results of each annual stack test shall be used in the GHG 
emissions calculations for the year of the test.
    (D) If, for the majority of the operating hours during the year, the 
diverted stream is withdrawn at a steady rate at or near the tested set 
point (as evidenced by fan and damper settings and/or other parameters), 
you may use the calculated CO<INF>2</INF> mass emission rate from 
paragraph (a)(4)(viii)(B) of this section to estimate the CO<INF>2</INF> 
mass emissions for all operating hours in which flue gas is diverted 
from the main exhaust system. Otherwise, you must account for the 
variation in the flow rate of the diverted stream, as described in 
paragraph (c)(4)(viii)(E) of this section.
    (E) If the flow rate of the diverted stream varies significantly 
throughout the year, except as provided below, repeat the stack test and 
emission rate calculation procedures described in paragraphs 
(c)(4)(viii)(A) and (c)(4)(viii)(B) of this section at a minimum of two 
more set points across the range of typical operating conditions to 
develop a correlation between CO<INF>2</INF> mass emission rate and the 
parametric data. If additional testing is not feasible, use the 
following approach to develop the necessary correlation. Assume that the 
average CO<INF>2</INF> concentration obtained in the annual stack test 
is the same at all operating set points. Then, beginning with the 
measured flow rate from the stack test and the associated parametric 
data, perform an engineering analysis to estimate the stack gas flow 
rate at two or more additional set points. Calculate the CO<INF>2</INF> 
mass emission rate at each set point.
    (F) Calculate the annual CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions for the 
diverted stream as follows. For a steady-state process, multiply the 
number of hours in which flue gas was diverted from the main exhaust 
system by the CO<INF>2</INF> mass emission rate from the stack test. 
Otherwise, using the best available information and engineering 
judgment, apply the most representative CO<INF>2</INF> mass emission 
rate from the correlation in paragraph (c)(4)(viii)(E) of this section 
to determine the CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions for each hour in which 
flue gas was diverted, and sum the results. To simplify the 
calculations, you may count partial operating hours as full hours.
    (G) Finally, add the CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions from 
paragraph(c)(4)(viii)(F) of this section to the annual CO<INF>2</INF> 
mass emissions measured by the CEMS at the main stack. Report this sum 
as the total annual CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions for the unit.
    (H) The exact method and procedures used to estimate the 
CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions for the diverted portion of the flue gas 
exhaust stream shall be documented in the Monitoring Plan required under 
Sec. 98.3(g)(5).
    (5) Alternative methods for certain units subject to Part 75 of this 
chapter. Certain units that are not subject to subpart D of this part 
and that report data to EPA according to part 75 of this chapter may 
qualify to use the alternative methods in this paragraph (a)(5), in lieu 
of using any of the four calculation methodology tiers.
    (i) For a unit that combusts only natural gas and/or fuel oil, is 
not subject to subpart D of this part, monitors and reports heat input 
data year-round according to appendix D to part 75 of this chapter, but 
is not required by the applicable part 75 program to report 
CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions data, calculate the annual CO<INF>2</INF> 
mass emissions for the purposes of this part as follows:
    (A) Use the hourly heat input data from appendix D to part 75 of 
this chapter, together with Equation G-4 in appendix G to part 75 of 
this chapter to determine the hourly CO<INF>2</INF> mass emission rates, 
in units of tons/hr;
    (B) Use Equations F-12 and F-13 in appendix F to part 75 of this 
chapter to calculate the quarterly and cumulative annual CO<INF>2</INF> 
mass emissions, respectively, in units of short tons; and
    (C) Divide the cumulative annual CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions value 
by 1.1 to convert it to metric tons.
    (ii) For a unit that combusts only natural gas and/or fuel oil, is 
not subject to subpart D of this part, monitors and reports heat input 
data year-round according to Sec. 75.19 of this chapter but is not 
required by the applicable part 75 program to report CO<INF>2</INF> mass 
emissions data, calculate the annual CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions for 
the purposes of this part as follows:

[[Page 421]]

    (A) Calculate the hourly CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions, in units of 
short tons, using Equation LM-11 in Sec. 75.19(c)(4)(iii) of this 
chapter.
    (B) Sum the hourly CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions values over the 
entire reporting year to obtain the cumulative annual CO<INF>2</INF> 
mass emissions, in units of short tons.
    (C) Divide the cumulative annual CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions value 
by 1.1 to convert it to metric tons.
    (iii) For a unit that is not subject to subpart D of this part, uses 
flow rate and CO<INF>2</INF> (or O<INF>2</INF>) CEMS to report heat 
input data year-round according to part 75 of this chapter, but is not 
required by the applicable part 75 program to report CO<INF>2</INF> mass 
emissions data, calculate the annual CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions as 
follows:
    (A) Use Equation F-11 or F-2 (as applicable) in appendix F to part 
75 of this chapter to calculate the hourly CO<INF>2</INF> mass emission 
rates from the CEMS data. If an O<INF>2</INF> monitor is used, convert 
the hourly average O<INF>2</INF> readings to CO<INF>2</INF> using 
Equation F-14a or F-14b in appendix F to part 75 of this chapter (as 
applicable), before applying Equation F-11 or F-2.
    (B) Use Equations F-12 and F-13 in appendix F to part 75 of this 
chapter to calculate the quarterly and cumulative annual CO<INF>2</INF> 
mass emissions, respectively, in units of short tons.
    (C) Divide the cumulative annual CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions value 
by 1.1 to convert it to metric tons.
    (iv) For units that qualify to use the alternative CO<INF>2</INF> 
emissions calculation methods in paragraphs (a)(5)(i) through 
(a)(5)(iii) of this section, if both biomass and fossil fuel are 
combusted during the year, separate calculation and reporting of the 
biogenic CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions (as described in paragraph (e) of 
this section) is optional, only for the 2010 reporting year, as provided 
in Sec. 98.3(c)(12).
    (b) Use of the four tiers. Use of the four tiers of CO<INF>2</INF> 
emissions calculation methodologies described in paragraph (a) of this 
section is subject to the following conditions, requirements, and 
restrictions:
    (1) The Tier 1 Calculation Methodology:
    (i) May be used for any fuel listed in Table C-1 of this subpart 
that is combusted in a unit with a maximum rated heat input capacity of 
250 mmBtu/hr or less.
    (ii) May be used for MSW in a unit of any size that does not produce 
steam, if the use of Tier 4 is not required.
    (iii) May be used for solid, gaseous, or liquid biomass fuels in a 
unit of any size provided that the fuel is listed in Table C-1 of this 
subpart.
    (iv) May not be used if you routinely perform fuel sampling and 
analysis for the fuel high heat value (HHV) or routinely receive the 
results of HHV sampling and analysis from the fuel supplier at the 
minimum frequency specified in Sec. 98.34(a), or at a greater 
frequency. In such cases, Tier 2 shall be used. This restriction does 
not apply to paragraphs (b)(1)(ii), (b)(1)(v), (b)(1)(vi), and 
(b)(1)(vii) of this section.

    (vii) May be used for the combustion of MSW and/or tires in a unit, 
provided that no more than 10 percent of the unit's annual heat input is 
derived from those fuels, combined. Notwithstanding this requirement, if 
a unit combusts both MSW and tires and the reporter elects not to 
separately calculate and report biogenic CO<INF>2</INF> emissions from 
the combustion of tires, Tier 1 may be used for the MSW combustion, 
provided that no more than 10 percent of the unit's annual heat input is 
derived from MSW.
    (2) The Tier 2 Calculation Methodology:
    (i) May be used for the combustion of any type of fuel in a unit 
with a maximum rated heat input capacity of 250 mmBtu/hr or less 
provided that the fuel is listed in Table C-1 of this subpart.
    (ii) May be used in a unit with a maximum rated heat input capacity 
greater than 250 mmBtu/hr for the combustion of natural gas and/or 
distillate fuel oil.

if the use of Tier 4 is not required.
    (3) The Tier 3 Calculation Methodology:
    (i) May be used for a unit of any size that combusts any type of 
fuel listed in Table C-1 of this subpart (except for MSW), unless the 
use of Tier 4 is required.
    (ii) Shall be used for a unit with a maximum rated heat input 
capacity greater than 250 mmBtu/hr that combusts any type of fuel listed 
in Table C-1 of this subpart (except MSW), unless either of the

98.36(c)(3), in a group of units served by a common supply pipe, having 
at least one unit with a maximum rated heat input capacity greater than 
250 mmBtu/hr), provided that both of the following conditions apply:
    (A) The use of Tier 4 is not required.
    (B) The fuel provides 10% or more of the annual heat input to the 
unit or, if Sec. 98.36(c)(3) applies, to the group of units served by a 
common supply pipe.
    (iv) Shall be used when specified in another applicable subpart of 
this part, regardless of unit size.
    (4) The Tier 4 Calculation Methodology:
    (i) May be used for a unit of any size, combusting any type of fuel. 
Tier 4 may also be used for any group of stationary fuel combustion

specified in paragraphs (b)(4)(ii)(A) through (b)(4)(ii)(F) of this 
section:
    (A) The unit has a maximum rated heat input capacity greater than 
250 mmBtu/hr, or if the unit combusts municipal solid waste and has a 
maximum rated input capacity greater than 600 tons per day of MSW.
    (B) The unit combusts solid fossil fuel or MSW as the primary fuel.
    (C) The unit has operated for more than 1,000 hours in any calendar 
year since 2005.
    (D) The unit has installed CEMS that are required either by an 
applicable Federal or State regulation or the unit's operating permit.
    (E) The installed CEMS include a gas monitor of any kind or a stack 
gas volumetric flow rate monitor, or both and the monitors have been 
certified, either in accordance with the requirements of part 75 of this 
chapter, part 60 of this chapter, or an applicable State continuous 
monitoring program.
    (F) The installed gas or stack gas volumetric flow rate monitors are 
required, either by an applicable Federal or State regulation or by the 
unit's operating permit, to undergo periodic quality assurance testing 
in accordance with either appendix B to part 75 of this chapter, 
appendix F to part 60 of this chapter, or an applicable State continuous 
monitoring program.
    (iii) Shall be used for a unit with a maximum rated heat input 
capacity of 250 mmBtu/hr or less and for a unit that combusts municipal 
solid waste with a maximum rated input capacity of 600 tons of MSW per 
day or less, if the unit meets all of the following three conditions:
    (A) The unit has both a stack gas volumetric flow rate monitor and a 
CO<INF>2</INF> concentration monitor.
    (B) The unit meets the conditions specified in paragraphs 
(b)(4)(ii)(B) through (b)(4)(ii)(D) of this section.
    (C) The CO<INF>2</INF> and stack gas volumetric flow rate monitors

(b)(4)(ii)(F) of this section.
    (iv) May apply to common stack or duct configurations where:
    (A) The combined effluent gas streams from two or more stationary 
fuel combustion units are vented through a monitored common stack or 
duct. In this case, Tier 4 shall be used if all of the conditions in 
paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(A)(1) of this section or if the conditions in 
paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(A)(2) of this section are met.
    (1) At least one of the units meets the requirements of paragraphs 
(b)(4)(ii)(A) through (b)(4)(ii)(C) of this

[[Page 423]]

section, and the CEMS installed at the common stack (or duct) meet the 
requirements of paragraphs (b)(4)(ii)(D) through (b)(4)(ii)(F) of this 
section.
    (2) At least one of the units and the monitors installed at the 
common stack or duct meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of 
this section.
    (B) The combined effluent gas streams from a process or 
manufacturing unit and a stationary fuel combustion unit are vented 
through a monitored common stack or duct. In this case, Tier 4 shall be 
used if the combustion unit and the monitors installed at the common 
stack or duct meet the applicability criteria specified in paragraph 
(b)(4)(iv)(A)(1), or (b)(4)(iv)(A)(2) of this section.
    (C) The combined effluent gas streams from two or more manufacturing 
or process units are vented through a common stack or duct. In this 
case, if any of the units is required by an applicable subpart of this 
part to use Tier 4, the CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions may be monitored 
at each individual unit, or the combined CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions 
may be monitored at the common stack or duct. However, if it is not 
feasible to monitor the individual units, the combined CO<INF>2</INF> 
mass emissions shall be monitored at the common stack or duct.
    (5) The Tier 4 Calculation Methodology shall be used:
    (i) Starting on January 1, 2010, for a unit that is required to 
report CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions beginning on that date, if all of 
the monitors needed to measure CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions have been 
installed and certified by that date.
    (ii) No later than January 1, 2011, for a unit that is required to 
report CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions beginning on January 1, 2010, if 
all of the monitors needed to measure CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions have 
not been installed and certified by January 1, 2010. In this case, you 
may use Tier 2 or Tier 3 to report GHG emissions for 2010. However, if 
the required CEMS are certified some time in 2010, you need not wait 
until January 1, 2011 to begin using Tier 4. Rather, you may switch from 
Tier 2 or Tier 3 to Tier 4 as soon as CEMS certification testing is 
successfully completed. If this reporting option is chosen, you must 
document the change in CO<INF>2</INF> calculation methodology in the 
Monitoring Plan required under Sec. 98.3(g)(5) and in the GHG emissions 
report under Sec. 98.3(c). Data recorded by the CEMS during a 
certification test period in 2010 may be used for reporting under this 
part, provided that the following two conditions are met:
    (A) The certification tests are passed in sequence, with no test 
failures.
    (B) No unscheduled maintenance or repair of the CEMS is performed 
during the certification test period.
    (iii) No later than 180 days following the date on which a change is 
made that triggers Tier 4 applicability under paragraph (b)(4)(ii) or 
(b)(4)(iii) of this section (e.g., a change in the primary fuel, manner 
of unit operation, or installed continuous monitoring equipment).
    (6) You may elect to use any applicable higher tier for one or more 
of the fuels combusted in a unit. For example, if a 100 mmBtu/hr unit 
combusts natural gas and distillate fuel oil, you may elect to use Tier 
1 for natural gas and Tier 3 for the fuel oil, even though Tier 1 could 
have been used for both fuels. However, for units that use either the 
Tier 4 or the alternative calculation methodology specified in paragraph 
(a)(5)(iii) of this section, CO<INF>2</INF> emissions from the 
combustion of all fuels shall be based solely on CEMS measurements.
    (c) Calculation of CH4 and N2O emissions from stationary combustion 
sources. You must calculate annual CH<INF>4</INF> and N<INF>2</INF>O 
mass emissions only for units that are required to report CO<INF>2</INF> 
emissions using the calculation methodologies of this subpart and for 
only those fuels that are listed in Table C-2 of this subpart.
    (1) Use Equation C-8 of this section to estimate CH<INF>4</INF> and 
N<INF>2</INF>O emissions for any fuels for which you use the Tier 1 or 
Tier 3 calculation methodologies for CO<INF>2</INF>, except when natural 
gas usage in units of therms or mmBtu is obtained from gas billing 
records. In that case, use Equation C-8a in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this 
section or Equation C-8b in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section (as 
applicable). For Equation C-8, use the same values for fuel consumption 
that you use for the Tier 1 or Tier 3 calculation.

    (i) If only one type of fuel listed in Table C-2 of this subpart is 
combusted during the reporting year, substitute the cumulative annual 
heat input from combustion of the fuel into Equation C-10 of this 
section to calculate the annual CH<INF>4</INF> or N<INF>2</INF>O 
emissions. For units in the Acid Rain Program and units that report heat 
input data to EPA year-round according to part 75 of this chapter, 
obtain the cumulative annual heat input directly from the electronic 
data reports required under Sec. 75.64 of this chapter. For Tier 4 
units, use the best available information, as described in paragraph 
(c)(4)(ii)(C) of this section, to estimate the cumulative annual heat 
input (HI)<INF>A</INF>.
    (ii) If more than one type of fuel listed in Table C-2 of this 
subpart is combusted during the reporting year, use Equation C-10 of 
this section separately for each type of fuel, except as provided in 
paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(B) of this section. Determine the appropriate 
values of (HI)<INF>A</INF> as follows:
    (A) For units in the Acid Rain Program and other units that report 
heat input data to EPA year-round according to part 75 of this chapter, 
obtain (HI)<INF>A</INF> for each type of fuel from the electronic data 
reports required under Sec. 75.64 of this chapter, except as otherwise 
provided in paragraphs (c)(4)(ii)(B) and (c)(4)(ii)(D) of this section.
    (B) For a unit that uses CEMS to monitor hourly heat input according 
to part 75 of this chapter, the value of (HI)<INF>A</INF> obtained from 
the electronic data reports under Sec. 75.64 of this chapter may be 
attributed exclusively to the fuel with the highest F-factor, when the 
reporting option in 3.3.6.5 of appendix F to part 75 of this chapter is 
selected and implemented.
    (C) For Tier 4 units, use the best available information (e.g., fuel 
feed rate measurements, fuel heating values, engineering analysis) to 
estimate the value of (HI)<INF>A</INF> for each type of fuel. 
Instrumentation used to make these estimates is not subject to the 
calibration requirements of Sec. 98.3(i) or to the QA requirements of 
Sec. 98.34.
    (D) Units in the Acid Rain Program and other units that report heat 
input data to EPA year-round according to part 75 of this chapter may 
use the best available information described in paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(C) 
of this section, to estimate (HI)<INF>A</INF> for each fuel type,

[[Page 426]]

whenever fuel-specific heat input values cannot be directly obtained 
from the electronic data reports under Sec. 75.64 of this chapter.
    (5) When multiple fuels are combusted during the reporting year, sum 
the fuel-specific results from Equations C-8, C-8a, C-8b, C-9a, C-9b, or 
C-10 of this section (as applicable) to obtain the total annual 
CH<INF>4</INF> and N<INF>2</INF>O emissions, in metric tons.
    (6) Calculate the annual CH<INF>4</INF> and N<INF>2</INF>O mass 
emissions from the combustion of blended fuels as follows:
    (i) If the mass or volume of each component fuel in the blend is 
measured before the fuels are mixed and combusted, calculate and report 
CH<INF>4</INF> and N<INF>2</INF>O emissions separately for each 
component fuel, using the applicable procedures in this paragraph (c).
    (ii) If the mass or volume of each component fuel in the blend is 
not measured before the fuels are mixed and combusted, a reasonable 
estimate of the percentage composition of the blend, based on best 
available information, is required. Perform the following calculations 
for each component fuel ``i'' that is listed in Table C-2:
    (A) Multiply (% Fuel)<INF>i</INF>, the estimated mass or volume 
percentage (decimal fraction) of component fuel ``i'', by the total 
annual mass or volume of the blended fuel combusted during the reporting 
year, to obtain an estimate of the annual consumption of component 
``i'';
    (B) Multiply the result from paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(A) of this section 
by the HHV of the fuel (default value or, if available, the measured 
annual average value), to obtain an estimate of the annual heat input 
from component ``i'';
    (C) Calculate the annual CH<INF>4</INF> and N<INF>2</INF>O emissions 
from component ``i'', using Equation C-8, C-8a, C-8b, C-9a, or C-10 of 
this section, as applicable;
    (D) Sum the annual CH<INF>4</INF> emissions across all component 
fuels to obtain the annual CH<INF>4</INF> emissions for the blend. 
Similarly sum the annual N<INF>2</INF>O emissions across all component 
fuels to obtain the annual N<INF>2</INF>O emissions for the blend. 
Report these annual emissions totals.
    (d) Calculation of CO<INF>2</INF> from sorbent.
    (1) When a unit is a fluidized bed boiler, is equipped with a wet 
flue gas desulfurization system, or uses other acid gas emission 
controls with sorbent injection to remove acid gases, if the chemical 
reaction between the acid gas and the sorbent produces CO<INF>2</INF> 
emissions, use Equation C-11 of this section to calculate the 
CO<INF>2</INF> emissions from the sorbent, except when those 
CO<INF>2</INF> emissions are monitored by CEMS. When a sorbent other 
than CaCO<INF>3</INF> is used, determine site-specific values of R and 
MW<INF>S</INF>.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR30OC09.017

Where:

CO<INF>2</INF> = CO<INF>2</INF> emitted from sorbent for the reporting 
year (metric tons).
S = Limestone or other sorbent used in the reporting year, from company 
records (short tons).
R = The number of moles of CO<INF>2</INF> released upon capture of one 
mole of the acid gas species being removed (R = 1.00 when the sorbent is 
CaCO<INF>3</INF> and the targeted acid gas species is SO<INF>2</INF>).
MW<INF>CO2</INF> = Molecular weight of carbon dioxide (44).
MW<INF>S</INF> = Molecular weight of sorbent (100 if calcium carbonate).
0.91 = Conversion factor from short tons to metric tons.

    (2) The total annual CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions reported for the 
unit shall include the CO<INF>2</INF> emissions from the combustion 
process and the CO<INF>2</INF> emissions from the sorbent.
    (e) Biogenic CO2 emissions from combustion of biomass with other 
fuels. Use the applicable procedures of this paragraph (e) to estimate 
biogenic CO<INF>2</INF> emissions from units that combust a combination 
of biomass and fossil fuels (i.e., either co-fired or blended fuels). 
Separate reporting of biogenic CO<INF>2</INF> emissions from the 
combined combustion of biomass and fossil fuels is required for those

[[Page 427]]

biomass fuels listed in Table C-1 of this section and for municipal 
solid waste. In addition, when a biomass fuel that is not listed in 
Table C-1 is combusted in a unit that has a maximum rated heat input 
greater than 250 mmBtu/hr, if the biomass fuel accounts for 10% or more 
of the annual heat input to the unit, and if the unit does not use CEMS 
to quantify its annual CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions, then, pursuant to 
Sec. 98.33(b)(3)(iii), Tier 3 must be used to determine the carbon 
content of the biomass fuel and to calculate the biogenic CO<INF>2</INF> 
emissions from combustion of the fuel. Notwithstanding these 
requirements, in accordance with Sec. 98.3(c)(12), separate reporting 
of biogenic CO<INF>2</INF> emissions is optional for the 2010 reporting 
year for units subject to subpart D of this part and for units that use 
the CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions calculation methodologies in part 75 
of this chapter, pursuant to paragraph (a)(5) of this section. However, 
if the owner or operator opts to report biogenic CO<INF>2</INF> 
emissions separately for these units, the appropriate method(s) in this 
paragraph (e) shall be used. Separate reporting of biogenic 
CO<INF>2</INF> emissions from the combustion of tires is also optional, 
but may be reported by following the provisions of paragraph (e)(3) of 
this section.
    (1) You may use Equation C-1 of this subpart to calculate the annual 
CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions from the combustion of the biomass fuels 
listed in Table C-1 of this subpart (except MSW and tires), in a unit of 
any size, including units equipped with a CO<INF>2</INF> CEMS, except 
when the use of Tier 2 is required as specified in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) 
of this section. Determine the quantity of biomass combusted using one 
of the following procedures in this paragraph (e)(1), as appropriate, 
and document the selected procedures in the Monitoring Plan under Sec. 
98.3(g):
    (i) Company records.
    (ii) The procedures in paragraph (e)(5) of this section.
    (iii) The best available information for premixed fuels that contain 
biomass and fossil fuels (e.g., liquid fuel mixtures containing 
biodiesel).
    (2) You may use the procedures of this paragraph if the following 
three conditions are met: First, a CO<INF>2</INF> CEMS (or a surrogate 
O<INF>2</INF> monitor) and a stack gas flow rate monitor are used to 
determine the annual CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions (either according to 
part 75 of this chapter, the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology, or the 
alternative calculation methodology specified in paragraph (a)(5)(iii) 
of this section); second, neither MSW nor tires is combusted in the unit 
during the reporting year; and third, the CO<INF>2</INF> emissions 
consist solely of combustion products (i.e., no process or sorbent 
emissions included).
    (i) For each operating hour, use Equation C-12 of this section to 
determine the volume of CO<INF>2</INF> emitted.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR30OC09.018

Where:

V<INF>CO2h</INF> = Hourly volume of CO<INF>2</INF> emitted (scf).
(%CO<INF>2</INF>)<INF>h</INF> = Hourly average CO<INF>2</INF> 
concentration, measured by the CO<INF>2</INF> concentration monitor, or, 
if applicable, calculated from the hourly average O<INF>2</INF> 
concentration (%CO<INF>2</INF>).
Q<INF>h</INF> = Hourly average stack gas volumetric flow rate, measured 
by the stack gas volumetric flow rate monitor (scfh).
t<INF>h</INF> = Source operating time (decimal fraction of the hour 
during which the source combusts fuel, i.e., 1.0 for a full operating 
hour, 0.5 for 30 minutes of operation, etc.).
100 = Conversion factor from percent to a decimal fraction.

    (ii) Sum all of the hourly V<INF>CO2h</INF> values for the reporting 
year, to obtain V<INF>total</INF>, the total annual volume of 
CO<INF>2</INF> emitted.
    (iii) Calculate the annual volume of CO<INF>2</INF> emitted from 
fossil fuel combustion using Equation C-13 of this section. If two or 
more types of fossil fuel are combusted during the year, perform a 
separate calculation with Equation C-13 of this section for each fuel 
and sum the results.

[[Page 428]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR30OC09.019

Where:

V<INF>ff</INF> = Annual volume of CO<INF>2</INF> emitted from combustion 
of a particular fossil fuel (scf).
Fuel = Total quantity of the fossil fuel combusted in the reporting 
year, from company records, as defined in Sec. 98.6 (lb for solid fuel, 
gallons for liquid fuel, and scf for gaseous fuel).
F<INF>c</INF> = Fuel-specific carbon based F-factor, either a default 
value from Table 1 in section 3.3.5 of appendix F to part 75 of this 
chapter, or a site-specific value determined under section 3.3.6 of 
appendix F to part 75 (scf CO<INF>2</INF>/mmBtu).
HHV = High heat value of the fossil fuel, from fuel sampling and 
analysis (annual average value in Btu/lb for solid fuel, Btu/gal for 
liquid fuel and Btu/scf for gaseous fuel, sampled as specified (e.g., 
monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or by lot) in Sec. 98.34(a)(2)). The 
average HHV shall be calculated according to the requirements of 
paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.
10\6\ = Conversion factor, Btu per mmBtu.

    (iv) Subtract V<INF>ff</INF> from V<INF>total</INF> to obtain 
V<INF>bio</INF>, the annual volume of CO<INF>2</INF> from the combustion 
of biomass.
    (v) Calculate the biogenic percentage of the annual CO<INF>2</INF> 
emissions,expressed as a decimal fraction, using Equation C-14 of this 
section:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR30OC09.020

    (vi) Calculate the annual biogenic CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions, in 
metric tons, by multiplying the results obtained from Equation C-14 of 
this section by the annual CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions in metric tons, 
as determined:
    (A) Under paragraph (a)(4)(vi) of this section, for units using the 
Tier 4 Calculation Methodology.
    (B) Under paragraph (a)(5)(iii)(B) of this section, for units using 
the alternative calculation methodology specified in paragraph 
(a)(5)(iii).
    (C) From the electronic data report required under Sec. 75.64 of 
this chapter, for units in the Acid Rain Program and other units using 
CEMS to monitor and report CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions according to 
part 75 of this chapter. However, before calculating the annual biogenic 
CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions, multiply the cumulative annual 
CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions by 0.91 to convert from short tons to 
metric tons.
    (3) You must use the procedures in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) through 
(e)(3)(iii) of this section to determine the annual biogenic 
CO<INF>2</INF> emissions from the combustion of MSW, except as otherwise 
provided in paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this section. These procedures also 
may be used for any unit that co-fires biomass and fossil fuels, 
including units equipped with a CO<INF>2</INF> CEMS, and units for which 
optional separate reporting of biogenic CO<INF>2</INF> emissions from 
the combustion of tires is selected.
    (i) Use an applicable CO<INF>2</INF> emissions calculation method in 
this section to quantify the total annual CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions 
from the unit.
    (ii) Determine the relative proportions of biogenic and non-biogenic 
CO<INF>2</INF> emissions in the flue gas on a quarterly basis using the 
method specified in Sec. 98.34(d) (for units that combust MSW as the 
primary fuel or as the only fuel with a biogenic component) or in Sec. 
98.34(e) (for other units, including units that combust tires).
    (iii) Determine the annual biogenic CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions 
from the unit by multiplying the total annual CO<INF>2</INF> mass 
emissions by the annual average biogenic decimal fraction obtained from 
Sec. 98.34(d) or Sec. 98.34(e), as applicable.
    (iv) If the combustion of MSW and/or tires provides no more than 10 
percent of the annual heat input to a unit, or if a small, batch 
incinerator combusts no more than 1,000 tons per year of MSW, you may 
estimate the annual biogenic CO<INF>2</INF> emissions as follows, in 
lieu of following the procedures in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) through 
(e)(3)(iii) of this section:
    (A) Calculate the total annual CO<INF>2</INF> emissions from 
combustion of MSW and/or tires in the unit, using the Tier 1 calculation 
methodology in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (B) Multiply the result from paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(A) of this section 
by the appropriate default factor to determine the annual biogenic 
CO<INF>2</INF> emissions, in metric tons. For MSW, use a default factor 
of 0.60 and for tires, use a default factor of 0.20.
    (4) If Equation C-1 or Equation C-2a of this section is selected to 
calculate the annual biogenic mass emissions for

[[Page 429]]

wood, wood waste, or other solid biomass-derived fuel, Equation C-15 of 
this section may be used to quantify biogenic fuel consumption, provided 
that all of the required input parameters are accurately quantified. 
Similar equations and calculation methodologies based on steam 
generation and boiler efficiency may be used, provided that they are 
documented in the GHG Monitoring Plan required by Sec. 98.3(g)(5).

(Fuel)<INF>p</INF> = Quantity of biomass consumed during the measurement 
period ``p'' (tons/year or tons/month, as applicable).

(Btu/lb).

or lb/year, as applicable).
(HI)<INF>nb</INF> = Heat input from co-fired fossil fuels and non-
biomass-derived fuels for the measurement period, based on company 
records of fuel usage and default or measured HHV values (Btu/month or

fuel (Btu/lb).
(Eff)<INF>bio</INF> = Percent efficiency of biomass-to-energy

    (5) For units subject to subpart D of this part and for units that 
use the methods in part 75 of this chapter to quantify CO<INF>2</INF> 
mass emissions in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section, you 
may calculate biogenic CO<INF>2</INF> emissions from the combustion of 
biomass fuels listed in Table C-1 of this subpart using Equation C-15a. 
This equation may not be used to calculate biogenic CO<INF>2</INF> 
emissions from the combustion of tires or MSW; the methods described in 
paragraph (e)(3) of this section must be used for those fuels. Whenever 
(HI)<INF>A</INF>, the annual heat input from combustion of biomass fuel 
in Equation C-15a, cannot be determined solely from the information in 
the electronic emissions reports under Sec. 75.64 of this chapter 
(e.g., in cases where a unit uses CEMS in combination with multiple F-
factors, a worst-case F-factor, or a prorated F-factor to report heat 
input rather than reporting heat input based on fuel type), use the best 
available information (as described in Sec. Sec. 98.33(c)(4)(ii)(C) and 
(c)(4)(ii)(D)) to determine (HI)<INF>A</INF>.

    CO2 = 0.001 * (HI)A * EF (Eq. C-15a)

          where feasible, from the electronic emissions reports required 
          under Sec. 75.64 of this chapter. Where this is not feasible 
          use best available information, as described in Sec. Sec. 
          98.33(c)(4)(ii)(C) and (c)(4)(ii)(D) (mmBtu)

<R05>
Sec. 98.34  Monitoring and QA/QC requirements.

    The CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions data for stationary fuel 
combustion sources shall be monitored as follows:
    (a) For the Tier 2 Calculation Methodology:
    (1) All fuel samples shall be taken at a location in the fuel 
handling system that provides a sample representative of the fuel 
combusted. The fuel sampling and analysis may be performed by either the 
owner or operator or the supplier of the fuel.
    (2) The minimum required frequency of the HHV sampling and analysis 
for each type of fuel or fuel mixture (blend) is specified in this 
paragraph. When the specified frequency for a particular fuel or blend 
is based on a specified time period (e.g., week, month, quarter, or 
half-year), fuel sampling and analysis is required only for those time 
periods in which the fuel or blend

[[Page 430]]

is combusted. The owner or operator may perform fuel sampling and 
analysis more often than the minimum required frequency, in order to 
obtain a more representative annual average HHV.
    (i) For natural gas, semiannual sampling and analysis is required 
(i.e., twice in a calendar year, with consecutive samples taken at least 
four months apart).
    (ii) For coal and fuel oil, and for any other solid or liquid fuel 
that is delivered in lots, analysis of at least one representative 
sample from each fuel lot is required. For fuel oil, as an alternative 
to sampling each fuel lot, a sample may be taken upon each addition of 
oil to the unit's storage tank. Flow proportional sampling, continuous 
drip sampling, or daily manual oil sampling may also be used, in lieu of 
sampling each fuel lot. If the daily manual oil sampling option is 
selected, sampling from a particular tank is required only on days when 
oil from the tank is combusted by the unit (or units) served by the 
tank. If you elect to sample from the storage tank upon each addition of 
oil to the tank, you must take at least one sample from each tank that 
is currently in service and whenever oil is added to the tank, for as 
long as the tank remains in service. You need not take any samples from 
a storage tank while it is out of service. Rather, take a sample when 
the tank is brought into service and whenever oil is added to the tank, 
for as long as the tank remains in service. If multiple additions of oil 
are made to a particular in-service tank on a given day (e.g., from 
multiple deliveries), one sample taken after the final addition of oil 
is sufficient. For the purposes of this section, a fuel lot is defined 
as a shipment or delivery of a single type of fuel (e.g., ship load, 
barge load, group of trucks, group of railroad cars, oil delivery via 
pipeline from a tank farm, etc.). However, if multiple deliveries of a 
particular type of fuel are received from the same supply source in a 
given calendar month, the deliveries for that month may be considered, 
collectively, to comprise a fuel lot, requiring only one representative 
sample, subject to the following conditions:
    (A) For coal, the ``type'' of fuel means the rank of the coal (i.e., 
anthracite, bituminous, sub-bituminous, or lignite). For fuel oil, the 
``type'' of fuel means the grade number or classification of the oil 
(e.g., No. 1 oil, No. 2 oil, kerosene, Jet A fuel, etc.).
    (B) The owner or operator shall document in the monitoring plan 
under Sec. 98.3(g)(5) how the monthly sampling of each type of fuel is 
performed.
    (iii) For liquid fuels other than fuel oil, and for gaseous fuels 
other than natural gas (including biogas), sampling and analysis is 
required at least once per calendar quarter. To the extent practicable, 
consecutive quarterly samples shall be taken at least 30 days apart.
    (iv) For other solid fuels (except MSW), weekly sampling is required 
to obtain composite samples, which are then analyzed monthly.
    (v) For fuel blends that are received already mixed, or that are 
mixed on-site without measuring the exact amount of each component, as 
described in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, determine the HHV of 
the blend as follows. For blends of solid fuels (except MSW), weekly 
sampling is required to obtain composite samples, which are analyzed 
monthly. For blends of liquid or gaseous fuels, sampling and analysis is 
required at least once per calendar quarter. More frequent sampling is 
recommended if the composition of the blend varies significantly during 
the year.
    (3) Special considerations for blending of fuels. In situations 
where different types of fuel listed in Table C-1 of this subpart (for 
example, different ranks of coal or different grades of fuel oil) are in 
the same state of matter (i.e., solid, liquid, or gas), and are blended 
prior to combustion, use the following procedures to determine the 
appropriate CO<INF>2</INF> emission factor and HHV for the blend.
    (i) If the fuels to be blended are received separately, and if the 
quantity (mass or volume) of each fuel is measured before the fuels are 
mixed and combusted, then, for each component of the blend, calculate 
the CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions separately. Substitute into Equation 
C-2a of this subpart the total measured mass or volume of the component 
fuel (from company records),

[[Page 431]]

together with the appropriate default CO<INF>2</INF> emission factor 
from Table C-1, and the annual average HHV, calculated according to 
Sec. 98.33(a)(2)(ii). In this case, the fact that the fuels are blended 
prior to combustion is of no consequence.
    (ii) If the fuel is received as a blend (i.e., already mixed) or if 
the components are mixed on site without precisely measuring the mass or 
volume of each one individually, a reasonable estimate of the relative 
proportions of the components of the blend must be made, using the best 
available information (e.g., the approximate annual average mass or 
volume percentage of each fuel, based on the typical or expected range 
of values). Determine the appropriate CO<INF>2</INF> emission factor and 
HHV for use in Equation C-2a of this subpart, as follows:
    (A) Consider the blend to be the ``fuel type,'' measure its HHV at 
the frequency prescribed in paragraph (a)(2)(v) of this section, and 
determine the annual average HHV value for the blend according to Sec. 
98.33(a)(2)(ii).
    (B) Calculate a heat-weighted CO<INF>2</INF> emission factor, 
(EF)<INF>B</INF>, for the blend, using Equation C-16 of this section. 
The heat-weighting in Equation C-16 is provided by the default HHVs 
(from Table C-1) and the estimated mass or volume percentages of the 
components of the blend.
    (C) Substitute into Equation C-2a of this subpart, the annual 
average HHV for the blend (from paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(A) of this section) 
and the calculated value of (EF)<INF>B</INF>, along with the total mass 
or volume of the blend combusted during the reporting year, to determine 
the annual CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions from combustion of the blend.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17DE10.003

Where:

(EF)<INF>B</INF> = Heat-weighted CO<INF>2</INF> emission factor for the 
          blend (kg CO<INF>2</INF>/mmBtu)
(HHV)<INF>i</INF> = Default high heat value for fuel ``i'' in the blend, 
          from Table C-1 (mmBtu per mass or volume)
(%Fuel)<INF>i</INF> = Estimated mass or volume percentage of fuel ``i'' 
          (mass % or volume %, as applicable, expressed as a decimal 
          fraction; e.g., 25% = 0.25)
(EF)<INF>i</INF> = Default CO<INF>2</INF> emission factor for fuel ``i'' 
          from Table C-1 (mmBtu per mass or volume)
(HHV)<INF>B</INF> = Annual average high heat value for the blend, 
          calculated according to Sec. 98.33(a)(2)(ii) (mmBtu per mass 
          or volume)

    (iii) Note that for the case described in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of 
this section, if measured HHV values for the individual fuels in the 
blend or for the blend itself are not routinely received at the minimum 
frequency prescribed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section (or at a 
greater frequency), and if the unit qualifies to use Tier 1, calculate 
(HHV)<INF>B</INF>*, the heat-weighted default HHV for the blend, using 
Equation C-17 of this section. Then, use Equation C-16 of this section, 
replacing the term (HHV)<INF>B</INF> with (HHV)<INF>B</INF>* in the 
denominator, to determine the heat-weighted CO<INF>2</INF> emission 
factor for the blend. Finally, substitute into Equation C-1 of this 
subpart, the calculated values of (HHV)<INF>B</INF>* and 
(EF)<INF>B</INF>, along with the total mass or volume of the blend 
combusted during the reporting year, to determine the annual 
CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions from combustion of the blend.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17DE10.004


[[Page 432]]


Where:

(HHV)<INF>B</INF>* = Heat-weighted default high heat value for the blend 
          (mmBtu per mass or Volume)
(HHV)<INF>i</INF> = Default high heat value for fuel ``i'' in the blend, 
          from Table C-1 (mmBtu per mass or volume)
(%Fuel)<INF>i</INF> = Estimated mass or volume percentage of fuel ``i'' 
          in the blend (mass % or volume %, as applicable, expressed as 
          a decimal fraction)

    (iv) If the fuel blend described in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this 
section consists of a mixture of fuel(s) listed in Table C-1 of this 
subpart and one or more fuels not listed in Table C-1, calculate 
CO<INF>2</INF> and other GHG emissions only for the Table C-1 fuel(s), 
using the best available estimate of the mass or volume percentage(s) of 
the Table C-1 fuel(s) in the blend. In this case, Tier 1 shall be used, 
with the following modifications to Equations C-17 and C-1, to account 
for the fact that not all of the fuels in the blend are listed in Table 
C-1:
    (A) In Equation C-17, apply the term (Fuel)<INF>i</INF> only to the 
Table C-1 fuels. For each Table C-1 fuel, (Fuel)<INF>i</INF> will be the 
estimated mass or volume percentage of the fuel in the blend, divided by 
the sum of the mass or volume percentages of the Table C-1 fuels. For 
example, suppose that a blend consists of two Table C-1 fuels (``A'' and 
``B'') and one fuel type (``C'') not listed in the Table, and that the 
volume percentages of fuels A, B, and C in the blend, expressed as 
decimal fractions, are, respectively, 0.50, 0.30, and 0.20. The term 
(Fuel)<INF>i</INF> in Equation C-17 for fuel A will be 0.50/(0.50 + 
0.30) = 0.625, and for fuel B, (Fuel)<INF>i</INF> will be 0.30/(0.50 + 
0.30) = 0.375.
    (B) In Equation C-1, the term ``Fuel'' will be equal to the total 
mass or volume of the blended fuel combusted during the year multiplied 
by the sum of the mass or volume percentages of the Table C-1 fuels in 
the blend. For the example in paragraph (a)(3)(iv)(A) of this section, 
``Fuel'' = (Annual volume of the blend combusted)(0.80).
    (4) If, for a particular type of fuel, HHV sampling and analysis is 
performed more often than the minimum frequency specified in paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section, the results of all valid fuel analyses shall be 
used in the GHG emission calculations.
    (5) If, for a particular type of fuel, valid HHV values are obtained 
at less than the minimum frequency specifed in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section, appropriate substitute data values shall be used in the 
emissions calculations, in accordance with missing data procedures of 
Sec. 98.35.
    (6) You must use one of the following appropriate fuel sampling and 
analysis methods. The HHV may be calculated using chromatographic 
analysis together with standard heating values of the fuel constituents, 
provided that the gas chromatograph is operated, maintained, and 
calibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions. Alternatively, 
you may use a method published by a consensus-based standards 
organization if such a method exists, or you may use industry standard 
practice to determine the high heat values. Consensus-based standards 
organizations include, but are not limited to, the following: ASTM

    (A) You may use the calibration procedures specified by the flow 
meter manufacturer.
    (B) You may use an appropriate flow meter calibration method 
published by a consensus-based standards organization, if such a method 
exists. Consensus-based standards organizations include, but are not 
limited to, the following: ASTM International (100 Barr Harbor Drive, 
P.O. Box CB700, West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania 19428-B2959, (800) 262-
1373, http://www.astm.org), the American National Standards Institute

8020, http://www.ansi.org), the American Gas Association (AGA, 400 North 
Capitol Street, NW., 4th Floor, Washington, DC 20001, (202) 824-7000, 
http://www.aga.org), the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME, 
Three Park Avenue, New York, NY 10016-5990, (800) 843-2763, http://
www.asme.org), the American Petroleum Institute (API, 1220 L Street, 
NW., Washington, DC 20005-4070, (202) 682-8000, http://www.api.org), and 
the North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB, 801 Travis Street, 
Suite 1675, Houston, TX 77002, (713) 356-0060, http://www.api.org).
    (C) You may use an industry-accepted practice.
    (ii) In addition to the initial calibration required by Sec. 
98.3(i), recalibrate each fuel flow meter (except as otherwise provided 
in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section) according to one of the 
following. You may recalibrate annually, at the minimum frequency 
specified by the manufacturer, or at the interval specified by industry 
standard practice.
    (iii) Fuel billing meters are exempted from the initial and ongoing 
calibration requirements of this paragraph and from the Monitoring Plan 
and recordkeeping requirements of Sec. Sec. 98.3(g)(5)(i)(C), (g)(6), 
and (g)(7), provided that the fuel supplier and the unit combusting the 
fuel do not have any common owners and are not owned by subsidiaries or 
affiliates of the same company. Meters used exclusively to measure the 
flow rates of fuels that are only used for unit startup are also 
exempted from the initial and ongoing calibration requirements of this 
paragraph.
    (iv) For the initial calibration of an orifice, nozzle, or venturi 
meter; in-situ calibration of the transmitters is sufficient. A primary 
element inspection (PEI) shall be performed at least once every three 
years.
    (v) For the continuously-operating units and processes described in 
Sec. 98.3(i)(6), the required flow meter recalibrations and, if 
necessary, the PEIs may be postponed until the next scheduled 
maintenance outage.
    (vi) If a mixture of liquid or gaseous fuels is transported by a 
common pipe, you may either separately meter each of the fuels prior to 
mixing, using flow meters calibrated according to Sec. 98.3(i), or 
consider the fuel mixture to be the ``fuel type'' and meter the mixed 
fuel, using a flow meter calibrated according to Sec. 98.3(i).
    (2) Oil tank drop measurements (if used to determine liquid fuel use 
volume) shall be performed according to any an appropriate method 
published by a consensus-based standards organization (e.g., the 
American Petroleum Institute).
    (3) The carbon content and, if applicable, molecular weight of the 
fuels shall be determined according to the procedures in this paragraph 
(b)(3).
    (i) All fuel samples shall be taken at a location in the fuel 
handling system that provides a sample representative of the fuel 
combusted. The fuel sampling and analysis may be performed by either the 
owner or operator or by the supplier of the fuel.
    (ii) For each type of fuel, the minimum required frequency for 
collecting and analyzing samples for carbon content and (if applicable) 
molecular weight is specified in this paragraph. When the sampling 
frequency is based on a specified time period (e.g., week, month, 
quarter, or half-year), fuel sampling and analysis is required for only 
those time periods in which the fuel is combusted.
    (A) For natural gas, semiannual sampling and analysis is required 
(i.e., twice in a calendar year, with consecutive samples taken at least 
four months apart).

[[Page 434]]

    (B) For coal and fuel oil and for any other solid or liquid fuel 
that is delivered in lots, analysis of at least one representative 
sample from each fuel lot is required. For fuel oil, as an alternative 
to sampling each fuel lot, a sample may be taken upon each addition of 
oil to the storage tank. Flow proportional sampling, continuous drip 
sampling, or daily manual oil sampling may also be used, in lieu of 
sampling each fuel lot. If the daily manual oil sampling option is 
selected, sampling from a particular tank is required only on days when 
oil from the tank is combusted by the unit (or units) served by the 
tank. If you elect to sample from the storage tank upon each addition of 
oil to the tank, you must take at least one sample from each tank that 
is currently in service and whenever oil is added to the tank, for as 
long as the tank remains in service. You need not take any samples from 
a storage tank while it is out of service. Rather, take a sample when 
the tank is brought into service and whenever oil is added to the tank, 
for as long as the tank remains in service. If multiple additions of oil 
are made to a particular in service tank on a given day (e.g., from 
multiple deliveries), one sample taken after the final addition of oil 
is sufficient. For the purposes of this section, a fuel lot is defined 
as a shipment or delivery of a single type of fuel (e.g., ship load, 
barge load, group of trucks, group of railroad cars, oil delivery via 
pipeline from a tank farm, etc.). However, if multiple deliveries of a 
particular type of fuel are received from the same supply source in a 
given calendar month, the deliveries for that month may be considered, 
collectively, to comprise a fuel lot, requiring only one representative 
sample, subject to the following conditions:
    (1) For coal, the ``type'' of fuel means the rank of the coal (i.e., 
anthracite, bituminous, sub-bituminous, or lignite). For fuel oil, the 
``type'' of fuel means the grade number or classification of the oil 
(e.g., No. 1 oil, No. 2 oil, kerosene, Jet A fuel, etc.).
    (2) The owner or operator shall document in the monitoring plan 
under Sec. 98.3(g)(5) how the monthly sampling of each type of fuel is 
performed.
    (C) For liquid fuels other than fuel oil and for biogas, sampling 
and analysis is required at least once per calendar quarter. To the 
extent practicable, consecutive quarterly samples shall be taken at 
least 30 days apart.
    (D) For other solid fuels (except MSW), weekly sampling is required 
to obtain composite samples, which are then analyzed monthly.
    (E) For gaseous fuels other than natural gas and biogas (e.g., 
process gas), daily sampling and analysis to determine the carbon 
content and molecular weight of the fuel is required if continuous, on-
line equipment, such as a gas chromatograph, is in place to make these 
measurements. Otherwise, weekly sampling and analysis shall be 
performed.
    (F) For mixtures (blends) of solid fuels, weekly sampling is 
required to obtain composite samples, which are analyzed monthly. For 
blends of liquid fuels, and for gas mixtures consisting only of natural 
gas and biogas, sampling and analysis is required at least once per 
calendar quarter. For gas mixtures that contain gases other than natural 
gas (including biogas), daily sampling and analysis to determine the 
carbon content and molecular weight of the fuel is required if 
continuous, on-line equipment is in place to make these measurements. 
Otherwise, weekly sampling and analysis shall be performed.
    (iii) If, for a particular type of fuel, sampling and analysis for 
carbon content and molecular weight is performed more often than the 
minimum frequency specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the 
results of all valid fuel analyses shall be used in the GHG emission 
calculations.
    (iv) If, for a particular type of fuel, sampling and analysis for 
carbon content and molecular weight is performed at less than the 
minimum frequency specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, 
appropriate substitute data values shall be used in the emissions 
calculations, in accordance with the missing data procedures of Sec. 
98.35.
    (v) To calculate the CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions from combustion 
of a blend of fuels in the same state of matter (solid, liquid, or gas), 
you may either:

[[Page 435]]

    (A) Apply Equation C-3, C-4 or C-5 of this subpart (as applicable) 
to each component of the blend, if the mass or volume, the carbon 
content, and (if applicable), the molecular weight of each component are 
accurately measured prior to blending; or
    (B) Consider the blend to be the ``fuel type.'' Then, at the 
frequency specified in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(F) of this section, measure 
the carbon content and, if applicable, the molecular weight of the blend 
and calculate the annual average value of each parameter in the manner 
described in Sec. 98.33(a)(2)(ii). Also measure the mass or volume of 
the blended fuel combusted during the reporting year. Substitute these 
measured values into Equation C-3, C-4, or C-5 of this subpart (as 
applicable).
    (4) You must use one of the following appropriate fuel sampling and 
analysis methods. The results of chromatographic analysis of the fuel 
may be used, provided that the gas chromatograph is operated, 
maintained, and calibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions. 
Alternatively, you may use a method published by a consensus-based 
standards organization if such a method exists, or you may use industry 
standard practice to determine the carbon content and molecular weight 
(for gaseous fuel) of the fuel. Consensus-based standards organizations 
include, but are not limited to, the following: ASTM International (100 
Barr Harbor Drive, P.O. Box CB700, West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania 
19428-B2959, (800) 262-1373, http://www.astm.org), the American National 
Standards Institute (ANSI, 1819 L Street, NW., 6th floor, Washington, DC 
20036, (202) 293-8020, http://www.ansi.org), the American Gas 
Association (AGA, 400 North Capitol Street, NW., 4th Floor, Washington, 
DC 20001, (202) 824-7000, http://www.aga.org), the American Society of 
Mechanical Engineers (ASME, Three Park Avenue, New York, NY 10016-5990, 
(800) 843-2763, http://www.asme.org), the American Petroleum Institute 
(API, 1220 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20005-4070, (202) 682-8000, 
http://www.api.org), and the North American Energy Standards Board 
(NAESB, 801 Travis Street, Suite 1675, Houston, TX 77002, (713) 356-
0060, http://www.api.org). The method(s) used shall be documented in the 
Monitoring Plan required under Sec. 98.3(g)(5).
    (c) For the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology, the CO<INF>2</INF>, flow 
rate, and (if applicable) moisture monitors must be certified prior to 
the applicable deadline specified in Sec. 98.33(b)(5).
    (1) For initial certification, you may use any one of the following 
three procedures in this paragraph.
    (i) Sec. Sec. 75.20(c)(2), (c)(4), and (c)(5) through (c)(7) of 
this chapter and appendix A to part 75 of this chapter.
    (ii) The calibration drift test and relative accuracy test audit 
(RATA) procedures of Performance Specification 3 in appendix B to part 
60 of this chapter (for the CO<INF>2</INF> concentration monitor) and 
Performance Specification 6 in appendix B to part 60 of this chapter 
(for the continuous emission rate monitoring system (CERMS)).
    (iii) The provisions of an applicable State continuous monitoring 
program.
    (2) If an O<INF>2</INF> concentration monitor is used to determine 
CO<INF>2</INF> concentrations, the applicable provisions of part 75 of 
this chapter, part 60 of this chapter, or an applicable State continuous 
monitoring program shall be followed for initial certification and on-
going quality assurance, and all required RATAs of the monitor shall be 
done on a percent CO<INF>2</INF> basis.
    (3) For ongoing quality assurance, follow the applicable procedures 
in either appendix B to part 75 of this chapter, appendix F to part 60 
of this chapter, or an applicable State continuous monitoring program. 
If appendix F to part 60 of this chapter is selected for on-going 
quality assurance, perform daily calibration drift assessments for both 
the CO<INF>2</INF> monitor (or surrogate O<INF>2</INF> monitor) and the 
flow rate monitor, conduct cylinder gas audits of the CO<INF>2</INF> 
concentration monitor in three of the four quarters of each year (except 
for non-operating quarters), and perform annual RATAs of the 
CO<INF>2</INF> concentration monitor and the CERMS.
    (4) For the purposes of this part, the stack gas volumetric flow 
rate monitor RATAs required by appendix B to part 75 of this chapter and 
the annual RATAs of the CERMS required by appendix F to part 60 of this 
chapter need only be done at one operating level, representing normal 
load or normal

[[Page 436]]

process operating conditions, both for initial certification and for 
ongoing quality assurance.
    (5) If, for any source operating hour, quality assured data are not 
obtained with a CO<INF>2</INF> monitor (or surrogate O<INF>2</INF> 
monitor), flow rate monitor, or (if applicable) moisture monitor, use 
appropriate substitute data values in accordance with the missing data 
provisions of Sec. 98.35.
    (6) For certain applications where combined process emissions and 
combustion emissions are measured, the CO<INF>2</INF> concentrations in 
the flue gas may be considerably higher than for combustion emissions 
alone. In such cases, the span of the CO<INF>2</INF> monitor may, if 
necessary, be set higher than the specified levels in the applicable 
regulations. If the CO<INF>2</INF> span value is set higher than 20 
percent CO<INF>2</INF>, the cylinder gas audits of the CO<INF>2</INF> 
monitor under appendix F to part 60 of this chapter may be performed at 
40 to 60 percent and 80 to 100 percent of span, in lieu of the 
prescribed calibration levels of 5 to 8 percent CO<INF>2</INF> and 10 to 
14 percent CO<INF>2</INF>.
    (7) Hourly average data from the CEMS shall be validated in a manner 
consistent with one of the following: Sec. Sec. 60.13(h)(2)(i) through 
(h)(2)(vi) of this chapter; Sec. 75.10(d)(1) of this chapter; or the 
hourly data validation requirements of an applicable State CEM 
regulation.
    (d) Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 98.33 (b)(1)(vi) and 
(b)(1)(vii), when municipal solid waste (MSW) is either the primary fuel 
combusted in a unit or the only fuel with a biogenic component combusted 
in the unit, determine the biogenic portion of the CO<INF>2</INF> 
emissions using ASTM D6866-08 Standard Test Methods for Determining the 
Biobased Content of Solid, Liquid, and Gaseous Samples Using Radiocarbon 
Analysis (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 98.7) and ASTM D7459-08 
Standard Practice for Collection of Integrated Samples for the 
Speciation of Biomass (Biogenic) and Fossil-Derived Carbon Dioxide 
Emitted from Stationary Emissions Sources (incorporated by reference, 
see Sec. 98.7). Perform the ASTM D7459-08 sampling and the ASTM D6866-
08 analysis at least once in every calendar quarter in which MSW is 
combusted in the unit. Collect each gas sample during normal unit 
operating conditions for at least 24 total (not necessarily consecutive) 
hours, or longer if the facility deems it necessary to obtain a 
representative sample. Notwithstanding this requirement, if the types of 
fuels combusted and their relative proportions are consistent throughout 
the year, the minimum required sampling time may be reduced to 8 hours 
if at least two 8-hour samples and one 24-hour sample are collected 
under normal operating conditions, and arithmetic average of the 
biogenic fraction of the flue gas from the 8-hour samples (expressed as 
a decimal) is within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq> 5 percent of the biogenic 
fraction from the 24-hour test. There must be no overlapping of the 8-
hour and 24-hour test periods. Document the results of the demonstration 
in the unit's monitoring plan. If the types of fuels and their relative 
proportions are not consistent throughout the year, an optional sampling 
approach that facilities may wish to consider to obtain a more 
representative sample is to collect an integrated sample by extracting a 
small amount of flue gas (e.g., 1 to 5 cc) in each unit operating hour 
during the quarter. Separate the total annual CO<INF>2</INF> emissions 
into the biogenic and non-biogenic fractions using the average 
proportion of biogenic emissions of all samples analyzed during the 
reporting year. Express the results as a decimal fraction (e.g., 0.30, 
if 30 percent of the CO<INF>2</INF> is biogenic). When MSW is the 
primary fuel for multiple units at the facility, and the units are fed 
from a common fuel source, testing at only one of the units is 
sufficient.
    (e) For other units that combust combinations of biomass fuel(s) (or 
heterogeneous fuels that have a biomass component, e.g., tires) and 
fossil (or other non-biogenic) fuel(s), in any proportions, ASTM D6866-
08 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 98.7) and ASTM D7459-08 
(incorporated by reference, see Sec. 98.7) may be used to determine the 
biogenic portion of the CO<INF>2</INF> emissions in every calendar 
quarter in which biomass and non-biogenic fuels are co-fired in the 
unit. Follow the procedures in paragraph (d) of this section. If the 
primary fuel for multiple units at the facility consists of tires, and 
the

[[Page 437]]

units are fed from a common fuel source, testing at only one of the 
units is sufficient.
    (f) The records required under Sec. 98.3(g)(2)(i) shall include an 
explanation of how the following parameters are determined from company 
records (or, if applicable, from the best available information):
    (1) Fuel consumption, when the Tier 1 and Tier 2 Calculation 
Methodologies are used, including cases where Sec. 98.36(c)(4) applies.
    (2) Fuel consumption, when solid fuel is combusted and the Tier 3 
Calculation Methodology is used.
    (3) Fossil fuel consumption when Sec. 98.33(e)(2) applies to a unit 
that uses CEMS to quantify CO<INF>2</INF> emissions and that combusts 
both fossil and biomass fuels.
    (4) Sorbent usage, when Sec. 98.33(d) applies.
    (5) Quantity of steam generated by a unit when Sec. 
98.33(a)(2)(iii) applies.
    (6) Biogenic fuel consumption and high heating value, as applicable, 
under Sec. Sec. 98.33(e)(5) and (e)(6).
    (7) Fuel usage for CH<INF>4</INF> and N<INF>2</INF>O emissions 
calculations under Sec. 98.33(c)(4)(ii).
    (8) Mass of biomass combusted, for premixed fuels that contain 
biomass and fossil fuels under Sec. 98.33(e)(1)(iii).

Sec. 98.35  Procedures for estimating missing data.

    Whenever a quality-assured value of a required parameter is 
unavailable (e.g., if a CEMS malfunctions during unit operation or if a 
required fuel sample is not taken), a substitute data value for the 
missing parameter shall be used in the calculations.
    (a) For all units subject to the requirements of the Acid Rain 
Program, and all other stationary combustion units subject to the 
requirements of this part that monitor and report emissions and heat 
input data year-round in accordance with part 75 of this chapter, the 
missing data substitution procedures in part 75 of this chapter shall be 
followed for CO<INF>2</INF> concentration, stack gas flow rate, fuel 
flow rate, high heating value, and fuel carbon content.
    (b) For units that use the Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, and Tier 4 
Calculation Methodologies, perform missing data substitution as follows 
for each parameter:
    (1) For each missing value of the high heating value, carbon 
content, or molecular weight of the fuel, substitute the arithmetic 
average of the quality-assured values of that parameter immediately 
preceding and immediately following the missing data incident. If the 
``after'' value has not been obtained by the time that the GHG emissions 
report is due, you may use the ``before'' value for missing data 
substitution or the best available estimate of the parameter, based on 
all available process data (e.g., electrical load, steam production, 
operating hours). If, for a particular parameter, no quality-assured 
data are available prior to the missing data incident, the substitute 
data value shall be the first quality-assured value obtained after the 
missing data period.
    (2) For missing records of CO<INF>2</INF> concentration, stack gas 
flow rate, percent moisture, fuel usage, and sorbent usage, the 
substitute data value shall be the best available estimate of the 
parameter, based on all available process data (e.g., electrical load, 
steam production, operating hours, etc.). You must document and retain 
records of the procedures used for all such estimates.

Sec. 98.36  Data reporting requirements.

    (a) In addition to the facility-level information required under 
Sec. 98.3, the annual GHG emissions report shall contain the unit-level 
or process-level emissions data in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this 
section (as applicable) and the emissions verification data in paragraph 
(e) of this section.
    (b) Units that use the four tiers. You shall report the following 
information for stationary combustion units that use the Tier 1, Tier 2, 
Tier 3, or Tier 4 methodology in Sec. 98.33(a) to calculate 
CO<INF>2</INF> emissions, except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (c) 
and (d) of this section:
    (1) The unit ID number.
    (2) A code representing the type of unit.
    (3) Maximum rated heat input capacity of the unit, in mmBtu/hr for 
boilers

[[Page 438]]

and process heaters only and relevant units of measure for other 
combustion sources.
    (4) Each type of fuel combusted in the unit during the report year.
    (5) The methodology (i.e., tier) used to calculate the 
CO<INF>2</INF> emissions for each type of fuel combusted (i.e., Tier 1, 
2, 3, or 4).
    (6) The methodology start date, for each fuel type.
    (7) The methodology end date, for each fuel type.
    (8) For a unit that uses Tiers 1, 2, or 3:
    (i) The annual CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions (including biogenic 
CO<INF>2</INF>), and the annual CH<INF>4</INF>, and N<INF>2</INF>O mass 
emissions for each type of fuel combusted during the reporting year, 
expressed in metric tons of each gas and in metric tons of 
CO<INF>2</INF>e; and
    (ii) Metric tons of biogenic CO<INF>2</INF> emissions (if 
applicable).
    (9) For a unit that uses Tier 4:
    (i) If the total annual CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions measured by 
the CEMS consists entirely of non-biogenic CO<INF>2</INF> (i.e., 
CO<INF>2</INF> from fossil fuel combustion plus, if applicable, 
CO<INF>2</INF> from sorbent and/or process CO<INF>2</INF>), report the 
total annual CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions, expressed in metric tons. 
You are not required to report the combustion CO<INF>2</INF> emissions 
by fuel type.
    (ii) Report the total annual CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions measured 
by the CEMS. If this total includes both biogenic and non-biogenic 
CO<INF>2</INF>, separately report the annual non-biogenic CO<INF>2</INF> 
mass emissions and the annual CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions from biomass 
combustion, each expressed in metric tons. You are not required to 
report the combustion CO<INF>2</INF> emissions by fuel type.
    (iii) An estimate of the heat input from each type of fuel listed in 
Table C-2 of this subpart that was combusted in the unit during the 
report year, and the annual CH<INF>4</INF> and N<INF>2</INF>O emissions 
for each of these fuels, expressed in metric tons of each gas and in 
metric tons of CO<INF>2</INF>e.
    (10) Annual CO<INF>2</INF> emissions from sorbent (if calculated 
using Equation C-11 of this subpart), expressed in metric tons.
    (c) Reporting alternatives for units using the four Tiers. You may 
use any of the applicable reporting alternatives of this paragraph to 
simplify the unit-level reporting required under paragraph (b) of this 
section:
    (1) Aggregation of units. If a facility contains two or more units 
(e.g., boilers or combustion turbines), each of which has a maximum 
rated heat input capacity of 250 mmBtu/hr or less, you may report the 
combined GHG emissions for the group of units in lieu of reporting GHG 
emissions from the individual units, provided that the use of Tier 4 is 
not required or elected for any of the units and the units use the same 
tier for any common fuels combusted. If this option is selected, the 
following information shall be reported instead of the information in 
paragraph (b) of this section:
    (i) Group ID number, beginning with the prefix ``GP''.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (iii)[Reserved]
    (iv) The highest maximum rated heat input capacity of any unit in 
the group (mmBtu/hr).
    (v) Each type of fuel combusted in the group of units during the 
reporting year.
    (vi) Annual CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions and annual CH<INF>4</INF>, 
and N<INF>2</INF>O mass emissions, aggregated for each type of fuel 
combusted in the group of units during the report year, expressed in 
metric tons of each gas and in metric tons of CO<INF>2</INF>e. If any of 
the units burn both fossil fuels and biomass, report also the annual 
CO<INF>2</INF> emissions from combustion of all fossil fuels combined 
and annual CO<INF>2</INF> emissions from combustion of all biomass fuels 
combined, expressed in metric tons.
    (vii) The methodology (i.e., tier) used to calculate the 
CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions for each type of fuel combusted in the 
units (i.e., Tier 1, Tier 2, or Tier 3).
    (viii) The methodology start date, for each fuel type.
    (ix) The methodology end date, for each fuel type.
    (x) The calculated CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions (if any) from 
sorbent expressed in metric tons.
    (2) Monitored common stack or duct configurations. When the flue 
gases from two or more stationary fuel combustion units at a facility 
are combined together in a common stack or

[[Page 439]]

duct before exiting to the atmosphere and if CEMS are used to 
continuously monitor CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions at the common stack 
or duct according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology, you may report 
the combined emissions from the units sharing the common stack or duct, 
in lieu of separately reporting the GHG emissions from the individual 
units. This monitoring and reporting alternative may also be used when 
process off-gases or a mixture of combustion products and process gases 
are combined together in a common stack or duct before exiting to the 
atmosphere. Whenever the common stack or duct monitoring option is 
applied, the following information shall be reported instead of the 
information in paragraph (b) of this section:
    (i) Common stack or duct identification number, beginning with the 
prefix ``CS''.
    (ii) Number of units sharing the common stack or duct. Report ``1'' 
when the flue gas flowing through the common stack or duct includes 
combustion products and/or process off-gases, and all of the effluent 
comes from a single unit (e.g., a furnace, kiln, petrochemical 
production unit, or smelter).
    (iii) Combined maximum rated heat input capacity of the units 
sharing the common stack or duct (mmBtu/hr). This data element is 
required only when all of the units sharing the common stack are 
stationary fuel combustion units.
    (iv) Each type of fuel combusted in the units during the year.
    (v) The methodology (tier) used to calculate the CO<INF>2</INF> mass 
emissions, i.e., Tier 4.
    (vi) The methodology start date.
    (vii) The methodology end date.
    (viii) Total annual CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions measured by the 
CEMS, expressed in metric tons. If any of the units burn both fossil 
fuels and biomass, separately report the annual non-biogenic 
CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions (i.e., CO<INF>2</INF> from fossil fuel 
combustion plus, if applicable, CO<INF>2</INF> from sorbent and/or 
process CO<INF>2</INF>) and the annual CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions 
from biomass combustion, each expressed in metric tons.
    (ix) An estimate of the heat input from each type of fuel listed in 
Table C-2 of this subpart that was combusted during the report year in 
the units sharing the common stack or duct during the report year, and, 
for each of these fuels, the annual CH<INF>4</INF> and N<INF>2</INF>O 
mass emissions from the units sharing the common stack or duct, 
expressed in metric tons of each gas and in metric tons of 
CO<INF>2</INF>e.
    (3) Common pipe configurations. When two or more stationary 
combustion units at a facility combust the same type of liquid or 
gaseous fuel and the fuel is fed to the individual units through a 
common supply line or pipe, you may report the combined emissions from 
the units served by the common supply line, in lieu of separately 
reporting the GHG emissions from the individual units, provided that the 
total amount of fuel combusted by the units is accurately measured at 
the common pipe or supply line using a fuel flow meter, or, for natural 
gas, the amount of fuel combusted may be obtained from gas billing 
records. For Tier 3 applications, the flow meter shall be calibrated in 
accordance with Sec. 98.34(b). If a portion of the fuel measured (or 
obtained from gas billing records) at the main supply line is diverted 
to either: A flare; or another stationary fuel combustion unit (or 
units), including units that use a CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions 
calculation method in part 75 of this chapter; or a chemical or 
industrial process (where it is used as a raw material but not 
combusted), and the remainder of the fuel is distributed to a group of 
combustion units for which you elect to use the common pipe reporting 
option, you may use company records to subtract out the diverted portion 
of the fuel from the fuel measured (or obtained from gas billing 
records) at the main supply line prior to performing the GHG emissions 
calculations for the group of units using the common pipe option. If the 
diverted portion of the fuel is combusted, the GHG emissions from the 
diverted portion shall be accounted for in accordance with the 
applicable provisions of this part. When the common pipe option is 
selected, the applicable tier shall be used based on the maximum rated 
heat input capacity of the largest unit served by the common pipe 
configuration, except where the applicable tier is based on criteria 
other

[[Page 440]]

than unit size. For example, if the maximum rated heat input capacity of 
the largest unit is greater than 250 mmBtu/hr, Tier 3 will apply, unless 
the fuel transported through the common pipe is natural gas or 
distillate oil, in which case Tier 2 may be used, in accordance with 
Sec. 98.33(b)(2)(ii). As a second example, in accordance with Sec. 
98.33(b)(1)(v), Tier 1 may be used regardless of unit size when natural 
gas is transported through the common pipe, if the annual fuel 
consumption is obtained from gas billing records in units of therms. 
When the common pipe reporting option is selected, the following 
information shall be reported instead of the information in paragraph 
(b) of this section:
    (i) Common pipe identification number, beginning with the prefix 
``CP''.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (iii) The highest maximum rated heat input capacity of any unit 
served by the common pipe (mmBtu/hr).
    (iv) The fuels combusted in the units during the reporting year.
    (v) The methodology used to calculate the CO<INF>2</INF> mass 
emissions (i.e., Tier 1, Tier 2, or Tier 3).
    (vi) If the any of the units burns both fossil fuels and biomass, 
the annual CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions from combustion of all fossil 
fuels and annual CO<INF>2</INF> emissions from combustion of all biomass 
fuels from the units served by the common pipe, expressed in metric 
tons.
    (vii) Annual CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions and annual CH<INF>4</INF> 
and N<INF>2</INF>O emissions from each fuel type for the units served by 
the common pipe, expressed in metric tons of each gas and in metric tons 
of CO<INF>2</INF>e.
    (viii) Methodology start date.
    (ix) Methodology end date.
    (4) The following alternative reporting option applies to facilities 
at which a common liquid or gaseous fuel supply is shared between one or 
more large combustion units, such as boilers or combustion turbines 
(including units subject to subpart D of this part and other units 
subject to part 75 of this chapter) and small combustion sources, 
including, but not limited to, space heaters, hot water heaters, and lab 
burners. In this case, you may simplify reporting by attributing all of 
the GHG emissions from combustion of the shared fuel to the large 
combustion unit(s), provided that:
    (i) The total quantity of the fuel combusted during the report year 
in the units sharing the fuel supply is measured, either at the ``gate'' 
to the facility or at a point inside the facility, using a fuel flow 
meter, billing meter, or tank drop measurements (as applicable);
    (ii) On an annual basis, at least 95 percent (by mass or volume) of 
the shared fuel is combusted in the large combustion unit(s), and the 
remainder is combusted in the small combustion sources. Company records 
may be used to determine the percentage distribution of the shared fuel 
to the large and small units; and
    (iii) The use of this reporting option is documented in the 
Monitoring Plan required under Sec. 98.3(g)(5). Indicate in the 
Monitoring Plan which units share the common fuel supply and the method 
used to demonstrate that this alternative reporting option applies. For 
the small combustion sources, a description of the types of units and 
the approximate number of units is sufficient.
    (d) Units subject to part 75 of this chapter.
    (1) For stationary combustion units that are subject to subpart D of 
this part, you shall report the following unit-level information:
    (i) Unit or stack identification numbers. Use exact same unit,

Sec. 98.84  Monitoring and QA/QC requirements.

    (a) You must determine the weight fraction of total CaO and total 
MgO in CKD not recycled to the kiln from each kiln using ASTM C114-09, 
Standard Test Methods for Chemical Analysis of Hydraulic Cement 
(incoporated by reference, see Sec. 98.7). The monitoring must be 
conducted quarterly for each kiln from a CKD sample drawn either as CKD 
is exiting the kiln or from bulk CKD storage.
    (b) You must determine the weight fraction of total CaO and total 
MgO in clinker from each kiln using ASTM C114-09 Standard Test Methods 
for Chemical Analysis of Hydraulic Cement (incorporated by reference, 
see Sec. 98.7). The monitoring must be conducted monthly for each kiln 
from a monthly clinker sample drawn from bulk clinker storage if storage 
is dedicated to the specific kiln, or from a monthly arithmetic average 
of daily

[[Page 465]]

clinker samples drawn from the clinker conveying systems exiting each 
kiln.
    (c) The total organic carbon content (dry basis) of raw materials 
must be determined annually using ASTM C114-09 Standard Test Methods for 
Chemical Analysis of Hydraulic Cement (incorporated by reference, see 
Sec. 98.7) or a similar industry standard practice or method approved 
for total organic carbon determination in raw mineral materials. The 
analysis must be conducted either on sample material drawn from bulk raw 
kiln feed storage or on sample material drawn from bulk raw material 
storage for each category of raw material (i.e., limestone, sand, shale, 
iron oxide, and alumina). Facilities that opt to use the default total 
organic carbon factor provided in Sec. 98.83(d)(3), are not required to 
monitor for TOC.
    (d) The quantity of clinker produced monthly by each kiln must be 
determined by direct weight measurement of clinker using the same plant 
techniques used for accounting purposes, such as reconciling weigh 
hopper or belt weigh feeder measurements against inventory measurements. 
As an alternative, facilities may also determine clinker production by 
direct measurement of raw kiln feed and application of a kiln-specific 
feed-to-clinker factor. Facilities that opt to use a feed-to-clinker 
factor must verify the accuracy of this factor on a monthly basis.
    (e) The quantity of CKD not recycled to the kiln generated by each 
kiln must be determined quarterly using the same plant techniques used 
for accounting purposes, such as direct weight measurement using weigh 
hoppers, truck weigh scales, or belt weigh feeders.
    (f) The annual quantity of raw kiln feed or annual quantity of each 
category of raw materials consumed by the facility (e.g., limestone, 
sand, shale, iron oxide, and alumina) must be determined monthly by 
direct weight measurement using the same plant instruments used for 
accounting purposes, such as weigh hoppers, truck weigh scales, or belt 
weigh feeders.
    (g) The monthly non-calcined CaO and MgO that remains in the clinker 
in the form of CaCO<INF>3</INF> or that enters the kiln as a non-
carbonate species may be assumed to be a default value of 0.0 or may be 
determined monthly by careful chemical analysis of feed material and 
clinker material from each kiln using well documented analytical and 
calculational methods or the appropriate industry standard practice.
    (h) The quarterly non-calcined CaO and MgO that remains in the CKD 
in the form of CaCO<INF>3</INF> or that enters the kiln as a non-
carbonate species may be assumed to be a default value of 0.0 or may be 
determined quarterly by careful chemical analysis of feed material and 
CKD material from each kiln using well documented analytical and 
calculational methods or the appropriate industry standard practice.

facilities calculated according to Sec. 98.83(d), if data on the 
carbonate content (of clinker or CKD), noncalcined content (of clinker 
or CKD) or the annual organic carbon content of raw materials are 
missing, facilities must undertake a new analysis.
    (c) For each missing value of monthly clinker production the 
substitute data value must be the best available estimate of the monthly 
clinker production based on information used for accounting purposes, or 
use the maximum tons per day capacity of the system and the number of 
days per month.
    (d) For each missing value of monthly raw material consumption the 
substitute data value must be the best

this section that use fluorinated GHGs or N<INF>2</INF>O. Facilities 
that may use these processes include, but are not limited to, facilities 
that manufacture micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS), liquid crystal 
displays (LCDs), photovoltaic cells (PV), and semiconductors (including 
light-emitting diodes (LEDs)).

containing fragments, that chemically react with exposed thin-films 
(e.g., dielectric, metals) or substrate (e.g., silicon) to selectively 
remove portions of material.
    (2) Any electronics production process in which chambers used for 
depositing thin films are cleaned periodically using plasma-generated 
fluorine atoms and other reactive fluorine-containing fragments.
    (3) Any electronics production process in which wafers are cleaned 
using plasma generated fluorine atoms or other reactive fluorine-
containing fragments to remove residual material from wafer surfaces, 
including the wafer edge.
    (4) Any electronics production process in which the chemical vapor 
deposition (CVD) process or other manufacturing processes use 
N<INF>2</INF>O.
    (5) Any electronics manufacturing production process in which 
fluorinated GHGs are used as heat transfer fluids to cool process 
equipment, to control temperature during device testing, to clean 
substrate surfaces and other parts, and for soldering (e.g., vapor phase 
reflow).

monitoring methods for any parameter that cannot reasonably be measured 
according to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements of this subpart. The 
owner or operator must use the calculation methodologies and equations 
in Sec. 98.93, but may use the best available monitoring method for any 
parameter for which it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, 
or operate a required piece of monitoring equipment in a facility, or to 
procure necessary measurement services by January 1, 2011. Starting no 
later than October 1, 2011, the owner or operator must discontinue using 
best available monitoring methods and begin following all applicable 
monitoring and QA/QC requirements of this part, except as provided in 
paragraphs (a)(2), (a)(3), or (a)(4) of this section. Best available 
monitoring methods means any of the following methods specified in this

purchased, delivered, or installed before

[[Page 476]]

July 1, 2011, include supporting documentation such as the date the 
monitoring equipment was ordered, investigation of alternative 
suppliers, and the dates by which alternative vendors promised delivery 
or installation, backorder notices or unexpected delays, descriptions of 
actions taken to expedite delivery or installation, and the current 
expected date of delivery or installation.
    (E) If the reason for the extension is that service providers were 
unable to provide necessary measurement services, include supporting 
documentation demonstrating that these services could not be acquired 
before July 1, 2011. This documentation must include written 
correspondence to and from at least three service providers stating that 
they will not be available to provide the necessary services before July 
1, 2011.

must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that by December 
31, 2011 it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, or operate 
the required piece of monitoring equipment or procure necessary 
measurement services to comply with the requirements of this subpart. As 
a condition for allowing the use of best available monitoring methods 
through December 31, 2011, facilities must recalculate and resubmit 
their 2011 estimated emissions using the requirements of this subpart. 
The facility's recalculated emissions must be reported with its report 
for the 2012 reporting year (to be submitted in 2013) unless the 
facility receives an additional extension under paragraph (a)(4) of this 
section.
    (4) Requests for extension of the use of best available monitoring 
methods beyond 2011. EPA does not anticipate approving the use of best 
available monitoring methods beyond December 31, 2011; however, EPA 
reserves the right to approve any such requests submitted for unique and 
extreme circumstances, which include safety,

[[Page 477]]

technical infeasibility, or inconsistency with other local, State or 
Federal regulations.
    (i) Timing of request. The extension request must be submitted to 
EPA no later than September 30, 2011.
    (ii) Content of request. Requests must contain the following 
information:
    (A) A list of parameters for which the owner or operator is seeking 
use of best available monitoring methods beyond 2011.
    (B) A description of the specific rule requirements that the owner 
or operator cannot meet, including a detailed explanation as to why the 
requirements can not be met.
    (C) Detailed description of the unique circumstances necessitating 
an extension, including specific data collection issues that do not meet 
safety regulations, technical infeasibility, or specific laws or 
regulations that conflict with data collection.
    (D) A detailed explanation and supporting documentation of how and 
when the owner or operator will receive the required data and/or 
services to comply with the reporting requirements of this subpart in 
the future.
    (E) A detailed description of the specific best available monitoring 
methods that the facility will use in place of the required methods.
    (F) The Administrator reserves the right to require that the owner 
or operator provide additional documentation.
    (iii) Approval criteria. To obtain approval, the owner or operator 
must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that by December 
31, 2011 (or in the case of facilities that are required to calculate 
and report emissions in accordance with Sec. 98.93(a)(2)(ii)(A), 
December 31, 2012), it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, 
or operate the required piece of monitoring equipment according to the 
requirements of this subpart. As a condition for allowing the use of 
best available monitoring methods through December 31, 2012, facilities 
must recalculate and resubmit their 2012 estimated emissions using the 
requirements of this subpart. Where a facility is allowed to use best 
available monitoring methods for apportioning gas consumption under 
Sec. 98.94(c), it is not required to verify its 2012 engineering model 
with its recalculated report. The facility's recalculated emissions must 
be reported with its report for the 2013 reporting year (to be submitted 
in 2014).
    (b) For purposes of Equation I-12 of this subpart, you must estimate 
facility-wide gas-specific heel factors for each container type for each 
gas used, except for fluorinated GHGs or N<INF>2</INF>O which your 
facility uses in quantities less than 50 kg in one reporting year, 
according to the procedures in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this 
section.
    (1) Base your facility-wide gas-specific heel factors on the trigger 
point for change out of a container for each container size and type for 
each gas used. Facility-wide gas-specific heel factors must be expressed 
as the ratio of the trigger point for change out, in terms of mass, to 
the initial mass in the container, as determined by paragraphs (b)(2) 
and (b)(3) of this section.
    (2) The trigger points for change out you use to calculate facility-
wide gas-specific heel factors in Sec. 98.94(b)(1) must be determined 
by monitoring the mass or the pressure of your containers. If you 
monitor the pressure, convert the pressure to mass using the ideal gas 
law, as displayed in Equation I-17 of this subpart, with the appropriate 
Z value selected based upon the properties of the gas.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR01DE10.018

Where:

p = Absolute pressure of the gas (Pa).
V = Volume of the gas (m\3\).
Z = Compressibility factor.
n = Amount of substance of the gas (moles).
R = Gas constant (8.314 Joule/Kelvin mole).
T = Absolute temperature (K).

    (3) The initial mass you use to calculate a facility-wide gas-
specific heel factor in Sec. 98.94(b)(1) may be based on the weight of 
the gas provided to you

[[Page 478]]

in gas supplier documents; however, you remain responsible for the 
accuracy of these masses and weights under this subpart.
    (4) If a container is changed in an exceptional circumstance, you 
must weigh that container or measure the pressure of that container with 
a pressure gauge, in place of using a heel factor to determine the 
residual weight of gas. An exceptional circumstance is a change out 
point that differs by more than 20 percent from the trigger point for 
change out used to calculate your facility-wide gas-specific heel factor 
for that gas and container type. When using mass-based trigger points 
for change out, you must determine if an exceptional circumstance has 
occurred based on the net weight of gas in the container, excluding the 
tare weight of the container.
    (5) You must re-calculate a facility-wide gas-specific heel factor 
if you use a trigger point for change out for a gas and container type 
that differs by more than 5 percent from the previously used trigger 
point for change out for that gas and container type.
    (c) You must develop apportioning factors for fluorinated GHG and 
N<INF>2</INF>O consumption to use in Equation I-13 of this subpart for 
each input gas i, as appropriate, using a facility-specific engineering 
model that is documented in your site GHG Monitoring Plan as required 
under Sec. 98.3(g)(5). This model must be based on a quantifiable 
metric, such as wafer passes or wafer starts. To verify your model, you 
must demonstrate its precision and accuracy by adhering to the 
requirements in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section.
    (1) You must demonstrate that the fluorinated GHG and N<INF>2</INF>O 
apportioning factors are developed using calculations that are 
repeatable, as defined in Sec. 98.98.
    (2) You must demonstrate the accuracy of your facility-specific 
model by comparing the actual amount of input gas i consumed and the 
modeled amount of input gas i consumed for the plasma etching and 
chamber cleaning process types, as follows:
    (i) You must analyze at least a 30-day period of operation during 
which the capacity utilization equals or exceeds 60 percent of its 
design capacity. In the event your facility operates below 60 percent of 
its design capacity during the reporting year, you must use the period 
during which the facility experiences its highest 30-day average 
utilization for model verification.
    (ii) You must compare the actual gas consumed of input gas i to the 
modeled gas consumed of input gas i for one fluorinated GHG reported 
under this subpart under the plasma etching process type and the chamber 
cleaning process type. You must certify that the fluorinated GHGs 
selected for comparison correspond to the largest quantities, on a mass 
basis, of fluorinated GHGs used at your facility during the reporting 
year for the plasma etching process type and the chamber cleaning 
process type.
    (iii) You must demonstrate that the comparison performed for the 
largest quantity of gas, on a mass basis, consumed under the plasma 
etching process type in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, does not 
result in a difference between the actual and modeled gas consumption 
that exceeds five percent relative to actual gas consumption, reported 
to one significant figure using standard rounding conventions.
    (d) If you use factors for fluorinated GHG process utilization and 
by-product formation rates other than the defaults provided in Tables I-
3, I-4, I-5, I-6, and I-7 to this subpart, you must use utilization and 
by-product formation rates that are developed with measurements made 
using the International SEMATECH <greek-i>06124825A-ENG (incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 98.7). You may use recipe-specific utilization and 
by-product formation rates that were measured using the International 
SEMATECH <greek-i>01104197A-XFR (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 
98.7) provided the measurements were made prior to January 1, 2007. You 
may use recipe-specific utilization and by-product formation rates 
measured by a third party, such as a manufacturing equipment supplier, 
if the conditions in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section are 
met.
    (1) The third party has measured recipe-specific utilization and by-
product formation rates using the International SEMATECH 
<greek-i>06124825A-ENG (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 98.7,)

[[Page 479]]

or the International SEMATECH <greek-i>01104197A-XFR (incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 98.7) provided the measurements were made prior to 
January 1, 2007.
    (2) Measurements made by a third party to develop recipe-specific 
utilization and by-product formation rates must have been made for 
recipes that are similar recipes to those used at your facility, as 
defined in Sec. 98.98.
    (e) If you use N<INF>2</INF>O utilization factors other than the 
defaults provided in Table I-8 to this subpart, you must use factors 
developed with measurements made using the International SEMATECH 
<greek-i>06124825A-ENG (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 98.7). You 
may use measurements made using the International SEMATECH 
<greek-i>01104197A-XFR (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 98.7) 
provided the measurements were made prior to January 1, 2007. You may 
use N<INF>2</INF>O utilization factors measured by a third party, such 
as a manufacturing equipment supplier, if the conditions in paragraphs 
(e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section are met.
    (1) The third party has measured N<INF>2</INF>O utilization factors 
using the International SEMATECH <greek-i>06124825A-ENG (incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 98.7,) or the International SEMATECH 
<greek-i>01104197A-XFR (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 98.7) 
provided the measurements were made prior to January 1, 2007.
    (2) The conditions under which the measurements were made are 
representative of your facility's N<INF>2</INF>O emitting production 
processes.
    (f) If your facility employs abatement systems and you wish to 
reflect emission reductions due to these systems in calculations in 
Sec. 98.93, you must adhere to the procedures in paragraphs (f)(1) and 
(f)(2) of this section. If you use the default destruction or removal 
efficiency of 60 percent, you must adhere to procedures in paragraph 
(f)(3) of this section. If you use either a properly measured 
destruction or removal efficiency as defined in Sec. 98.98, or a class 
average of properly measured destruction or removal efficiencies during 
a reporting year, you must adhere to procedures in paragraph (f)(4) of 
this section.
    (1) You must certify and document that the abatement systems are 
properly installed, operated, and maintained according to manufacturers' 
specifications by adhering to the procedures in paragraphs (1)(i) and 
(1)(ii) of this section.

using Equation I-15 of this subpart.
    (3) To report emissions using the default destruction or removal 
efficiency of 60 percent, you must certify and document that the 
abatement systems at your facility are specifically designed for 
fluorinated GHG and N<INF>2</INF>O abatement.
    (4) If you do not use the default destruction or removal efficiency 
value to calculate and report controlled emissions, you must use either 
a properly measured destruction or removal efficiency, or a class 
average of properly measured destruction or removal efficiencies, 
determined in accordance with procedures in paragraphs (f)(4)(i) through 
(f)(4)(v) of this section.
    (i) A properly measured destruction or removal efficiency value must 
be determined in accordance with EPA 430-R-10-003 (incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 98.7).
    (ii) You must annually select and properly measure the destruction 
or removal efficiency for a random sample of abatement systems to 
include in a random sampling abatement system testing program (RSASTP) 
in accordance with procedures in paragraphs (f)(4)(ii)(A) and 
(f)(4)(ii)(B) of this section.
    (A) Each reporting year for each abatement system class a random 
sample of three or 20 percent of installed abatement systems, whichever 
is greater, must be tested. If 20 percent of the total number of 
abatement systems in each class does not equate to a whole number, the 
number of systems to be tested must be determined by rounding up to the 
nearest integer.

[[Page 480]]

    (B) You must select the random sample each reporting year for the 
RSASTP without repetition of previously-measured systems in the sample, 
until all systems in each class are properly measured in a 5-year 
period.
    (iii) If you have measured the destruction or removal efficiency of 
a particular abatement system during the previous 2-year period, you 
must calculate emissions from that system using the most recently 
measured destruction or removal efficiency for that particular system.
    (iv) If the destruction or removal efficiency of an individual 
abatement system has not been properly measured during the previous 2-
year period, you may use a simple average of the properly measured 
destruction or removal efficiencies for systems of that class, in 
accordance with the RSASTP. Your facility must maintain or exceed the 
RSASTP schedule if you wish to apply class average destruction or 
removal efficiency factors to abatement systems that have not yet been 
properly measured.
    (v) If your facility uses redundant abatement systems, you may 
account for the total abatement system uptime calculated for a specific 
exhaust stream during the reporting year.

GHG and N<INF>2</INF>O utilization and by-product formation rates.
    (2) Where you use facility-specific, recipe-specific fluorinated GHG 
and N<INF>2</INF>O utilization and by-product formation rates measured 
prior to January 1, 2007, verify that the QA/QC procedures in the 
International SEMATECH <greek-i>01104197A-XFR (incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 98.7) were followed during measurement and 
calculation of the factors.
    (3) Follow the QA/QC procedures in accordance with those in EPA 430-

inventory of gas stored in containers at the beginning of the reporting 
year is the same as the inventory of gas stored in containers at the end 
of the previous reporting year.
    (h) You must adhere to the QA/QC procedures of this paragraph (h) 
when calculating annual gas consumption for each fluorinated GHG and 
N<INF>2</INF>O used at your facility and fluorinated GHG emissions from 
heat transfer fluid use.
    (1) Review all inputs to Equations I-11 and I-16 of this subpart to 
ensure that all inputs and outputs are accounted for.
    (2) Do not enter negative inputs into the mass balance Equations I-
11 and I-16 of this subpart and ensure that no negative emissions are 
calculated.
    (3) Ensure that the inventory at the beginning of one reporting year 
is identical to the inventory reported at the end of the previous 
reporting year.
    (4) Ensure that the total quantity of gas i in containers in service 
at the end of a reporting year is accounted for as if the in-service 
containers were full for Equation I-11 of this subpart. Ensure also that 
the same quantity is accounted for in the inventory of input gas i 
stored in containers at the beginning of the subsequent reporting year.
    (i) All flowmeters, weigh scales, pressure gauges, and thermometers 
used to measure quantities that are monitored under this section or used 
in calculations under Sec. 98.93 must have an accuracy and precision of 
one percent of full scale or better.

Sec. 98.98  Definitions.

    Except as provided in this section, all of the terms used in this 
subpart have the same meaning given in the Clean Air Act and subpart A 
of this part. If a conflict exists between a definition provided in this 
subpart and a definition provided in subpart A, the definition in this 
subpart takes precedence for the reporting requirements in this subpart.
    Abatement system means a device or equipment that destroys or 
removes fluorinated GHGs and N<INF>2</INF>O in waste streams from one or 
more electronics manufacturing production processes.
    Actual gas consumption means the quantity of gas used during wafer/
substrate processing over some period based on a measured change in gas 
container weight or gas container pressure or on a measured volume of 
gas.
    By-product formation means the creation of fluorinated GHGs during 
electronics manufacturing production processes or the creation of 
fluorinated GHGs by an abatement system. By-product formation is the 
ratio of the mass of the by-product formed to the mass flow of the input 
gas, where, for multi-fluorinated-GHG recipes, the denominator 
corresponds to the fluorinated GHG with the largest mass flow.
    Chamber cleaning is a process type that consists of the process sub-
types defined in paragraphs (1) through (3) of this definition.
    (1) In situ plasma process sub-type consists of the cleaning of 
thin-film production chambers, after processing substrates, with a 
fluorinated GHG cleaning reagent that is dissociated into its cleaning 
constituents by a plasma generated inside the chamber where the film is 
produced.
    (2) Remote plasma process sub-type consists of the cleaning of thin-
film production chambers, after processing substrates, with a 
fluorinated GHG cleaning reagent dissociated by a remotely located 
plasma source.
    (3) In situ thermal process sub-type consists of the cleaning of 
thin-film production chambers, after processing substrates, with a 
fluorinated GHG cleaning reagent that is thermally dissociated into its 
cleaning constituents inside the chamber where thin films are produced.
    Class means a category of abatement systems grouped by manufacturer 
model number(s) and by the gas that the system abates, including 
N<INF>2</INF>O and carbon tetrafluoride (CF<INF>4</INF>) direct 
emissions and by-product formation, and all other fluorinated GHG direct 
emissions and by-product formation. Classes may also include any other 
abatement systems for which the reporting facility wishes to report 
controlled emissions provided that class is identified.
    Controlled emissions means the quantity of emissions that are 
released to the atmosphere after application of an emission control 
device (e.g., abatement system).
    Destruction or removal efficiency (DRE) means the efficiency of an 
abatement system to destroy or remove fluorinated GHGs, N<INF>2</INF>O, 
or both. The destruction or removal efficiency is equal to one minus the 
ratio of the mass of all relevant GHGs exiting the abatement system to 
the mass of GHG entering the abatement system. When GHGs are formed in 
an abatement system, destruction or removal efficiency is expressed as 
one minus the ratio of amounts of exiting GHGs to the

[[Page 485]]

amounts entering the system in units of CO<INF>2</INF>-equivalents 
(CO<INF>2</INF>e).
    Gas utilization means the fraction of input N<INF>2</INF>O or 
fluorinated GHG converted to other substances during the etching, 
deposition, and/or wafer and chamber cleaning processes. Gas utilization 
is expressed as a rate or factor for specific electronics manufacturing 
recipes, process sub-types, or process types.
    Heat transfer fluids are fluorinated GHGs used for temperature 
control, device testing, and soldering in certain types of electronic 
manufacturing production processes. Heat transfer fluids used in the 
electronics sector include perfluoropolyethers, perfluoroalkanes, 
perfluoroethers, tertiary perfluoroamines, and perfluorocyclic ethers. 
Electronics manufacturers may also use these same fluorinated chemicals 
to clean substrate surfaces and other parts.
    Heel means the amount of gas that remains in a gas container after 
it is discharged or off-loaded; heel may vary by container type.
    Individual recipe means a specific combination of gases, under 
specific conditions of reactor temperature, pressure, flow, radio 
frequency (RF) power and duration, used repeatedly to fabricate a 
specific feature on a specific film or substrate.
    Maximum designed substrate starts means the maximum quantity of 
substrates, expressed as surface area, that could be started each month 
during a reporting year if the facility were fully equipped as defined 
in the facility design specifications and if the equipment were fully 
utilized. It denotes 100 percent of annual manufacturing capacity of a 
facility.
    Modeled gas consumed means the quantity of gas used during wafer/
substrate processing over some period based on a verified facility-
specific engineering model used to apportion gas consumption.
    Nameplate capacity means the full and proper charge of chemical 
specified by the equipment manufacturer to achieve the equipment's 
specified performance. The nameplate capacity is typically indicated on 
the equipment's nameplate; it is not necessarily the actual charge, 
which may be influenced by leakage and other emissions.
    Operational mode means the time in which an abatement system is 
being operated within the range of parameters as specified in the 
operations manual provided by the system manufacturer.
    Plasma etching is a process type that consists of any production 
process using fluorinated GHG reagents to selectively remove materials 
from a substrate during electronics manufacturing. The materials removed 
may include SiO<INF>2,</INF> SiO<INF>X</INF>-based or fully organic-
based thin-film material, SiN, SiON, Si<INF>3</INF>N<INF>4</INF>, SiC, 
SiCO, SiCN, etc. (represented by the general chemical formula, 
Si<INF>w</INF>O<INF>X</INF>N<INF>y</INF>X<INF>z</INF> where w, x, y and 
z are zero or integers and X may be some other element such as carbon), 
substrate, or metal films (such as aluminum or tungsten).
    Process sub-type is a set of similar manufacturing steps, more 
closely related within a broad process type. For example, the chamber 
cleaning process type includes in-situ plasma chamber cleaning, remote 
plasma chamber cleaning, and in-situ thermal chamber cleaning sub-types.
    Process types are broad groups of manufacturing steps used at a 
facility associated with substrate (e.g., wafer) processing during 
device manufacture for which fluorinated GHG emissions and fluorinated 
GHG usages are calculated and reported. The process types are Plasma 
etching, Chamber cleaning, and Wafer cleaning.
    Properly measured destruction or removal efficiency means 
destruction or removal efficiencies measured in accordance with EPA 430-
R-10-003 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 98.7).
    The Random Sampling Abatement System Testing Program (RSASTP) means 
the required frequency for measuring the destruction or removal 
efficiencies of abatement systems in order to apply properly measured 
destruction or removal efficiencies to report controlled emissions.
    Redundant abatement systems means a system that is specifically 
designed, installed and operated for the purpose of destroying 
fluorinated GHGs and N<INF>2</INF>O gases. A redundant abatement system 
is used as a backup to the main

[[Page 486]]

fluorinated GHGs and N<INF>2</INF>O abatement system during those times 
when the main system is not functioning or operating in accordance with 
design and operating specifications.
    Repeatable means that the variables used in the formulas for the 
facility's engineering model for gas apportioning factors are based on 
observable and measurable quantities that govern gas consumption rather 
than engineering judgment about those quantities or gas consumption.
    Similar, with respect to recipes, means those recipes that are 
composed of the same set of chemicals and have the same flow 
stabilization times and where the documented differences, considered 
separately, in reactor pressure, individual gas flow rates, and applied 
radio frequency (RF) power are less than or equal to plus or minus 10 
percent. For purposes of comparing and documenting recipes that are 
similar, facilities may use either the best known method provided by an 
equipment manufacturer or the process of record, for which emission 
factors for either have been measured.
    Trigger point for change out means the residual weight or pressure 
of a gas container type that a facility uses to change out that gas 
container.
    Uptime means the ratio of the total time during which the abatement 
system is in an operational mode with fluorinated GHGs or N<INF>2</INF>O 
flowing through production process tool(s) connected to that abatement 
system, to the total time during which fluorinated GHGs or 
N<INF>2</INF>O are flowing through production process tool(s) connected 
to that abatement system.
    Wafer cleaning is a process type that consists of any production 
process using fluorinated GHG reagents to clean wafers at any step 
during production.
    Wafer passes is a count of the number of times a wafer substrate is 
processed in a specific process recipe, sub-type, or type. The total 
number of wafer passes over a reporting year is the number of wafer 
passes per tool multiplied by the number of operational process tools in 
use during the reporting year.
    Wafer starts means the number of fresh wafers that are introduced 
into the fabrication sequence each month. It includes test wafers, which 
means wafers that are exposed to all of the conditions of process 
characterization, including but not limited to actual etch conditions or 
actual film deposition conditions.

<R05>
Sec. 98.114  Monitoring and QA/QC requirements.

    If you determine annual process CO<INF>2</INF> emissions using the 
carbon mass balance procedure in Sec. 98.113(b)(2), you must meet the 
requirements specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
    (a) Determine the annual mass for each material used for the 
calculations of annual process CO<INF>2</INF> emissions using Equation 
K-1 of this subpart by summing the monthly mass for the material 
determined for each month of the calendar year. The monthly mass may be 
determined using plant instruments used for accounting purposes, 
including either direct measurement of the quantity of the material 
placed in the unit or by calculations using process operating 
information.
    (b) For each material identified in paragraph (a) of this section, 
you must determine the average carbon content of the material consumed, 
used, or produced in the calendar year using the methods specified in 
either paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section. If you document that 
a specific process input or output contributes less than one percent of 
the total mass of carbon into or out of the process, you do not have to 
determine the monthly mass or annual carbon content of that input or 
output.
    (1) Information provided by your material supplier.
    (2) Collecting and analyzing at least three representative samples 
of the material inputs and outputs each year. The carbon content of the 
material must be analyzed at least annually using the standard methods 
(and their QA/QC procedures) specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through 
(b)(2)(iii) of this section, as applicable.
    (i) ASTM E1941-04, Standard Test Method for Determination of Carbon 
in Refractory and Reactive Metals and Their Alloys (incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 98.7) for analysis of metal ore and alloy product.
    (ii) ASTM D5373-08 Standard Test Methods for Instrumental 
Determination of Carbon, Hydrogen, and Nitrogen in Laboratory Samples of 
Coal (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 98.7), for analysis of 
carbonaceous reducing agents and carbon electrodes.
    (iii) ASTM C25-06, Standard Test Methods for Chemical Analysis of 
Limestone, Quicklime, and Hydrated Lime (incorporated by reference, see 
Sec. 98.7) for analysis of flux materials such as limestone or 
dolomite.


<R05>
Sec. 98.115  Procedures for estimating missing data.

    A complete record of all measured parameters used in the GHG 
emissions calculations in Sec. 98.113 is required. Therefore, whenever 
a quality-assured value of a required parameter is unavailable, a 
substitute data value for the missing parameter shall be used in the 
calculations as specified in the paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. 
You must document and keep records of the procedures used for all such 
estimates.
    (a) If you determine CO<INF>2</INF> emissions for the EAFs at your 
facility using the carbon mass balance procedure in Sec. 98.113(b), 100 
percent data availability is required for the carbon content of the 
input and output materials. You must repeat the test for average carbon 
contents of inputs according to the procedures in Sec. 98.114(b) if 
data are missing.
    (b) For missing records of the monthly mass of carbon-containing 
inputs and outputs, the substitute data value must be based on the best 
available estimate of the mass of the inputs and outputs from on all 
available process data or data used for accounting purposes, such as 
purchase records.
    (c) If you are required to calculate CH<INF>4</INF> emissions for an 
EAF at your facility as specified in Sec. 98.113(d), the estimate is 
based an annual quantity of certain alloy products, so 100 percent data 
availability is required.


<R05>
Sec. 98.116  Data reporting requirements.

    In addition to the information required by Sec. 98.3(c), each 
annual report must contain the information specified in paragraphs (a) 
through (e) of this section, as applicable:
    (a) Annual facility ferroalloy product production capacity (tons).
    (b) Annual production for each ferroalloy product identified in 
Sec. 98.110, from each EAF (tons).

[[Page 494]]

    (c) Total number of EAFs at facility used for production of 
ferroalloy products.
    (d) If a CEMS is used to measure CO<INF>2</INF> emissions, then you 
must report under this subpart the relevant information required by 
Sec. 98.36 for the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology and the following 
information specified in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(3) of this 
section.

                  Subpart L_Fluorinated Gas Production

    Source: 75 FR 74831, Dec. 1, 2010, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 98.120  Definition of the source category.

    (a) The fluorinated gas production source category consists of 
processes that produce a fluorinated gas from any raw material or 
feedstock chemical, except for processes that generate HFC-23 during the 
production of HCFC-22.
    (b) To produce a fluorinated gas means to manufacture a fluorinated 
gas from any raw material or feedstock chemical. Producing a fluorinated 
gas includes producing a fluorinated GHG as defined at Sec. 98.410(b). 
Producing a fluorinated gas also includes the manufacture of a 
chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) or hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) from any raw 
material or feedstock chemical, including manufacture of a CFC or HCFC 
as an isolated intermediate for use in a process that will result in the 
transformation of the CFC or HCFC either at or outside of the production 
facility. Producing a fluorinated gas does not include the reuse or 
recycling of a fluorinated gas, the creation of HFC-23 during the 
production of HCFC-22, the creation of intermediates that are created 
and transformed in a single process with no storage of the 
intermediates, or the creation of fluorinated GHGs that are released or 
destroyed at the production facility before the production measurement 
in Sec. 98.414(a).


<R05>
Sec. 98.121  Reporting threshold.

    You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility 
contains a fluorinated gas production process that generates or emits 
fluorinated GHG and the facility meets the requirements of either Sec. 
98.2(a)(1) or (a)(2). To calculate GHG emissions for comparison to the 
25,000 metric ton CO<INF>2</INF>e per year emission threshold in Sec. 
98.2(a)(2), calculate process emissions from fluorinated gas production 
using uncontrolled GHG emissions.

[[Page 496]]


<R05>
Sec. 98.122  GHGs to report.

    (a) You must report CO<INF>2</INF>, CH<INF>4</INF>, and 
N<INF>2</INF>O combustion emissions from each stationary combustion 
unit. You must calculate and report these emissions under subpart C of 
this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources) by following the 
requirements of subpart C.
    (b) You must report under subpart O of this part (HCFC-22 Production 
and HFC-23 Destruction) the emissions of HFC-23 from HCFC-22 production 
processes and HFC-23 destruction processes. Do not report the generation 
and emissions of HFC-23 from HCFC-22 production under this subpart.
    (c) You must report the total mass of each fluorinated GHG emitted 
from:
    (1) Each fluorinated gas production process and all fluorinated gas 
production processes combined.
    (2) Each fluorinated gas transformation process that is not part of 
a fluorinated gas production process and all such fluorinated gas 
transformation processes combined, except report separately fluorinated 
GHG emissions from transformation processes where a fluorinated GHG 
reactant is produced at another facility.
    (3) Each fluorinated gas destruction process that is not part of a 
fluorinated gas production process or a fluorinated gas transformation 
process and all such fluorinated gas destruction processes combined.
    (4) Venting of residual fluorinated GHGs from containers returned 
from the field.


<R05>
Sec. 98.123  Calculating GHG emissions.

    For fluorinated gas production and transformation processes, you 
must calculate the fluorinated GHG emissions from each process using 
either the mass balance method specified in paragraph (b) of this 
section or the emission factor or emission calculation factor method 
specified in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section, as 
appropriate. For destruction processes that destroy fluorinated GHGs 
that were previously ``produced'' as defined at Sec. 98.410(b), you 
must calculate emissions using the procedures in paragraph (f) of this 
section. For venting of residual gas from containers (e.g., cylinder 
heels), you must calculate emissions using the procedures in paragraph 
(g) of this section.
    (a) Default GWP value. In paragraphs (b)(1) and (c)(1) of this 
section and in Sec. 98.124(b)(8) and (c)(2), use a GWP of 2,000 for 
fluorinated GHGs that do not have GWPs listed in Table A-1 to subpart A 
of this part, except as provided in paragraph Sec. 98.123(c)(1)(vi). Do 
not report CO<INF>2</INF>e emissions under Sec. 98.3(c)(4) for 
fluorinated GHGs that do not have GWPs listed in Table A-1 to subpart A 
of this part.
    (b) Mass balance method. Before using the mass balance approach to 
estimate your fluorinated GHG emissions from a process, you must ensure 
that the process and the equipment and methods used to measure it meet 
either the error limits described in this paragraph and calculated under 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section or the requirements specified in 
paragraph Sec. 98.124(b)(8). If you choose to calculate the error 
limits, you must estimate the absolute and relative errors associated 
with using the mass balance approach on that process using Equations L-1 
through L-4 of this section in conjunction with Equations L-5 through L-
10 of this section. You may use the mass-balance approach to estimate 
emissions from the process if this calculation results in an absolute 
error of less than or equal to 3,000 metric tons CO<INF>2</INF>e per 
year or a relative error of less than or equal to 30 percent of the 
estimated CO<INF>2</INF>e fluorinated GHG emissions. If you do not meet 
either of the error limits or the requirements of paragraph Sec. 
98.124(b)(8), you must use the emission factor approach detailed in 
paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section to estimate emissions from 
the process.
    (1) Error calculation. To perform the calculation, you must first 
calculate the absolute and relative errors associated with the 
quantities calculated using either Equations L-7 through L-10 of this 
section or Equation L-17 of this section. Alternatively, you may 
estimate these errors based on the variability of previous process 
measurements (e.g., the variability of measurements of stream 
concentrations), provided these measurements are representative of the 
current process and

[[Page 497]]

current measurement devices and techniques. Once errors have been 
calculated for the quantities in these equations, those errors must be 
used to calculate the errors in Equations L-6 and L-5 of this section. 
You may ignore the errors associated with Equations L-11, L-12, and L-13 
of this section.
    (i) Where the measured quantity is a mass, the error in the mass 
must be equated to the accuracy or precision (whichever is larger) of 
the flowmeter, scale, or combination of volumetric and density 
measurements at the flow rate or mass measured.
    (ii) Where the measured quantity is a concentration of a stream 
component, the error of the concentration must be equated to the 
accuracy or precision (whichever is larger) with which you estimate the 
mean concentration of that stream component, accounting for the 
variability of the process, the frequency of the measurements, and the 
accuracy or precision (whichever is larger) of the analytical technique 
used to measure the concentration at the concentration measured. If the 
variability of process measurements is used to estimate the error, this 
variability shall be assumed to account both for the variability of the 
process and the precision of the analytical technique. Use standard 
statistical techniques such as the student's t distribution to estimate 
the error of the mean of the concentration measurements as a function of 
process variability and frequency of measurement.
    (iii) Equation L-1 of this section provides the general formula for 
calculating the absolute errors of sums and differences where the sum, 
S, is the summation of variables measured, a, b, c, etc. (e.g., S = a + 
b + c):
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR01DE10.019

Where:

e<INF>SA</INF> = Absolute error of the sum, expressed as one half of a 
          95 percent confidence interval.
e<INF>a</INF> = Relative error of a, expressed as one half of a 95 
          percent confidence interval.
e<INF>b</INF> = Relative error of b, expressed as one half of a 95 
          percent confidence interval.
e<INF>c</INF> = Relative error of c, expressed as one half of a 95 
          percent confidence interval.

    (iv) Equation L-2 of this section provides the general formula for 
calculating the relative errors of sums and differences:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR01DE10.020

Where:

e<INF>SR</INF> = Relative error of the sum, expressed as one half of a 
          95 percent confidence interval.
e<INF>SA</INF> = Absolute error of the sum, expressed as one half of a 
          95 percent confidence interval.
a+b+c = Sum of the variables measured.

    (v) Equation L-3 of this section provides the general formula for 
calculating the absolute errors of products (e.g., flow rates of GHGs 
calculated as the product of the flow rate of the stream and the 
concentration of the GHG in the stream), where the product, P, is the 
result of multiplying the variables measured, a, b, c, etc. (e.g., P = 
a*b*c):
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR01DE10.021


[[Page 498]]


Where:

e<INF>PA</INF> = Absolute error of the product, expressed as one half of 
          a 95 percent confidence interval.
e<INF>a</INF> = Relative error of a, expressed as one half of a 95 
          percent confidence interval.
e<INF>b</INF> = Relative error of b, expressed as one half of a 95 
          percent confidence interval.
e<INF>c</INF> = Relative error of c, expressed as one half of a 95 
          percent confidence interval.

    (vi) Equation L-4 of this section provides the general formula for 
calculating the relative errors of products:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR01DE10.022

Where:

e<INF>PR</INF> = Relative error of the product, expressed as one half of 
          a 95 percent confidence interval.
e<INF>PA</INF> = Absolute error of the product, expressed as one half of 
          a 95 percent confidence interval.
a*b*c = Product of the variables measured.

    (vii) Calculate the absolute error of the emissions estimate in 
terms of CO<INF>2</INF>e by performing a preliminary estimate of the 
annual CO<INF>2</INF>e emissions of the process using the method in 
paragraph (b)(1)(viii) of this section. Multiply this result by the 
relative error calculated for the mass of fluorine emitted from the 
process in Equation L-6 of this section.
    (viii) To estimate the annual CO<INF>2</INF>e emissions of the 
process for use in the error estimate, apply the methods set forth in 
paragraphs (b)(2) through (b)(7) and (b)(9) through (b)(16) of this 
section to representative process measurements. If these process 
measurements represent less than one year of typical process activity, 
adjust the estimated emissions to account for one year of typical 
process activity. To estimate the terms FER<INF>d</INF>, FEP, and 
FEB<INF>k</INF> for use in the error estimate for Equations L-11, L-12, 
and L-13 of this section, you must either use emission testing, 
monitoring of emitted streams, and/or engineering calculations or 
assessments, or in the alternative assume that all fluorine is emitted 
in the form of the fluorinated GHG that has the highest GWP among the 
fluorinated GHGs that occur in more than trace concentrations in the 
process. To convert the fluorinated GHG emissions to CO<INF>2</INF>e, 
use Equation A-1 of Sec. 98.2. For fluorinated GHGs whose GWPs are not 
listed in Table A-1 to subpart A of this part, use a default GWP of 
2,000.
    (2) The total mass of each fluorinated GHG emitted annually from 
each fluorinated gas production and each fluorinated GHG transformation 
process must be estimated by using Equation L-5 of this section.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR01DE10.023

Where:

E<INF>FGHGf</INF> = Total mass of each fluorinated GHG f emitted 
          annually from production or transformation process i (metric 
          tons).

          emitted from production process i over the period p (metric 
          tons, calculated in Equation L-13 of this section).
n = Number of concentration and flow measurement periods for the year.

    (3) The total mass of fluorine emitted from process i over the 
period p must be estimated at least monthly by calculating the 
difference between the total mass of fluorine in the

[[Page 499]]

reactant(s) (or inputs, for processes that do not involve a chemical 
reaction) and the total mass of fluorine in the product (or outputs, for 
processes that do not involve a chemical reaction), accounting for the 
total mass of fluorine in any destroyed or recaptured streams that 
contain reactants, products, or by-products (or inputs or outputs). This 
calculation must be performed using Equation L-6 of this section. An 
element other than fluorine may be used in the mass-balance equation, 
provided the element occurs in all of the fluorinated GHGs fed into or 
generated by the process. In this case, the mass fractions of the 
element in the reactants, products, and by-products must be calculated 
as appropriate for that element.

          over the period p (metric tons).

    (8) To estimate the terms FER<INF>d</INF>, FEP, and FEB<INF>k</INF> 
for Equations L-11, L-12, and L-13 of this section, you must assume that 
the total mass of fluorine emitted, E<INF>F</INF>, estimated in Equation 
L-6 of this section, occurs in the form of the fluorinated GHG that has 
the highest GWP among the fluorinated GHGs that occur in more than trace 
concentrations in the process unless you possess emission 
characterization measurements showing otherwise. These emission 
characterization measurements must meet the requirements in paragraph 
(8)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section, as appropriate. The sum of the 
terms must equal 1. You must document the data and calculations that are 
used to speciate individual compounds and to

[[Page 501]]

estimate FER<INF>d</INF>, FEP, and FEB<INF>k</INF>. Exclude from your 
calculations the fluorine included in F<INF>D</INF>. For example, 
exclude fluorine-containing compounds that are not fluorinated GHGs and 
that result from the destruction of fluorinated GHGs by any destruction 
devices (e.g., the mass of HF created by combustion of an HFC). However, 
include emissions of fluorinated GHGs that survive the destruction 
process.
    (i) If the calculations under paragraph (b)(1)(viii) of this 
section, or any subsequent measurements and calculations under this 
subpart, indicate that the process emits 25,000 metric tons 
CO<INF>2</INF>e or more, estimate the emissions from each process vent, 
considering controls, using the methods in Sec. 98.123(c)(1). You must 
characterize the emissions of any process vent that emits 25,000 metric 
tons CO<INF>2</INF>e or more as specified in Sec. 98.124(b)(4).
    (ii) For other vents, including vents from processes that emit less 
than 25,000 metric tons CO<INF>2</INF>e, you must characterize emissions 
as specified in Sec. 98.124(b)(5).
    (iii) For fluorine emissions that are not accounted for by vent 
estimates, you must characterize emissions as specified in Sec. 
98.124(b)(6).
    (9) The total mass of fluorine-containing reactant d emitted must be 
estimated at least monthly based on the total fluorine emitted and the 
fraction that consists of fluorine-containing reactants using Equation 
L-11 of this section. If the fluorine-containing reactant d is a non-
GHG, you may assume that FER<INF>d</INF> is zero.

may assume that FEP is zero.

    (c) Emission factor and emission calculation factor methods. To use 
the method in this paragraph for batch processes, you must comply with 
either paragraph (c)(3) of this section (Emission Factor approach) or 
paragraph (c)(4) of this section (Emission Calculation Factor approach). 
To use the method in this paragraph for continuous processes, you must 
first make a preliminary estimate of the emissions from each individual 
continuous process vent under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. If your 
continuous process operates under different conditions as part of normal 
operations, you must also define the different operating scenarios and 
make a preliminary estimate of the emissions from the vent for each 
operating scenario. Then, compare the preliminary estimate for each 
continuous process vent (summed across operating scenarios) to the 
criteria in paragraph (c)(2) of this section to determine whether the 
process vent meets the criteria for using the emission factor method 
described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section or whether the process 
vent meets the criteria for using the emission calculation factor method 
described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section. For continuous process 
vents that meet the criteria for using the emission factor method 
described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section and that have more than 
one operating scenario, compare the preliminary estimate for each 
operating scenario to the criteria in (c)(3)(ii) to determine whether an 
emission factor must be developed for that operating scenario.
    (1) Preliminary estimate of emissions by process vent. You must 
estimate the annual CO<INF>2</INF>e emissions of fluorinated GHGs for 
each process vent within each operating scenario of a continuous process 
using the approaches specified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (c)(1)(ii) of 
this section, accounting for any destruction as specified in paragraph 
(c)(1)(iii) of this section. You must determine emissions of fluorinated 
GHGs by process vent by using measurements, by using calculations based 
on chemical engineering principles and chemical property data, or by 
conducting an engineering assessment. You may use previous measurements, 
calculations, and assessments if they represent current process 
operating conditions or process operating conditions that would result 
in higher fluorinated GHG emissions than the current operating 
conditions and if they were performed in accordance with paragraphs 
(c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii), and (c)(1)(iii) of this section, as applicable. 
You must document all data, assumptions, and procedures used in the 
calculations or engineering assessment

[[Page 505]]

and keep a record of the emissions determination as required by Sec. 
98.127(a).
    (i) Engineering calculations. For process vent emission 
calculations, you may use any of paragraphs (c)(1)(i)(A), (c)(1)(i)(B), 
or (c)(1)(i)(C) of this section.
    (A) U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Emission Inventory 
Improvement Program, Volume II: Chapter 16, Methods for Estimating Air 
Emissions from Chemical Manufacturing Facilities, August 2007, Final 
(incorporated by reference, see Sec. 98.7).
    (B) You may determine the fluorinated GHG emissions from any process 
vent within the process using the procedures specified in Sec. 
63.1257(d)(2)(i) and (d)(3)(i)(B) of this chapter, except as specified 
in paragraphs (c)(1)(i)(B)(1) through (c)(1)(i)(B)(4) of this section. 
For the purposes of this subpart, use of the term ``HAP'' in Sec. 
63.1257(d)(2)(i) and (d)(3)(i)(B) of this chapter means ``fluorinated 
GHG''.
    (1) To calculate emissions caused by the heating of a vessel without 
a process condenser to a temperature lower than the boiling point, you 
must use the procedures in Sec. 63.1257(d)(2)(i)(C)(3) of this chapter.
    (2) To calculate emissions from depressurization of a vessel without 
a process condenser, you must use the procedures in Sec. 
63.1257(d)(2)(i)(D)(10) of this chapter.
    (3) To calculate emissions from vacuum systems, the terms used in 
Equation 33 to Sec. 63.1257(d)(2)(i)(E) of this chapter are defined as 
follows:
    (i) P<INF>system</INF> = Absolute pressure of the receiving vessel.
    (ii) P<INF>i</INF>= Partial pressure of the fluorinated GHG 
determined at the exit temperature and exit pressure conditions of the 
condenser or at the conditions of the dedicated receiver.
    (iii) P<INF>j</INF>= Partial pressure of condensables (including 
fluorinated GHG) determined at the exit temperature and exit pressure 
conditions of the condenser or at the conditions of the dedicated 
receiver.
    (iv) MW<INF>Fluorinated GHG</INF>= Molecular weight of the 
fluorinated GHG determined at the exit temperature and exit pressure 
conditions of the condenser or at the conditions of the dedicated 
receiver.
    (4) To calculate emissions when a vessel is equipped with a process 
condenser or a control condenser, you must use the procedures in Sec. 
63.1257(d)(3)(i)(B) of this chapter, except as follows:
    (i) You must determine the flowrate of gas (or volume of gas), 
partial pressures of condensables, temperature (T), and fluorinated GHG 
molecular weight (MW<INF>Fluorinated GHG</INF>) at the exit temperature 
and exit pressure conditions of the condenser or at the conditions of 
the dedicated receiver.
    (ii) You must assume that all of the components contained in the 
condenser exit vent stream are in equilibrium with the same components 
in the exit condensate stream (except for noncondensables).
    (iii) You must perform a material balance for each component, if the 
condensate receiver composition is not known.
    (iv) For the emissions from gas evolution, the term for time, t, 
must be used in Equation 12 to Sec. 63.1257(d)(2)(i)(B) of this 
chapter.
    (v) Emissions from empty vessel purging must be calculated using 
Equation 36 to Sec. 63.1257(d)(2)(i)(H) of this chapter and the exit 
temperature and exit pressure conditions of the condenser or the 
conditions of the dedicated receiver.
    (C) Commercial software products that follow chemical engineering 
principles (e.g., including the calculation methodologies in paragraphs 
(c)(1)(i)(A) and (c)(1)(i)(B) of this section).
    (ii) Engineering assessments. For process vent emissions 
determinations, you may conduct an engineering assessment to calculate 
uncontrolled emissions. An engineering assessment includes, but is not 
limited to, the following:
    (A) Previous test results, provided the tests are representative of 
current operating practices of the process.
    (B) Bench-scale or pilot-scale test data representative of the 
process operating conditions.
    (C) Maximum flow rate, fluorinated GHG emission rate, concentration, 
or other relevant parameters specified or implied within a permit limit 
applicable to the process vent.

[[Page 506]]

    (D) Design analysis based on chemical engineering principles, 
measureable process parameters, or physical or chemical laws or 
properties.
    (iii) Impact of destruction for the preliminary estimate. If the 
process vent is vented to a destruction device, you may reflect the 
impact of the destruction device on emissions. In your emissions 
estimate, account for the following:
    (A) The destruction efficiencies of the device that have been 
demonstrated for the fluorinated GHGs in the vent stream for periods 
when the process vent is vented to the destruction device.
    (B) Any periods when the process vent is not vented to the 
destruction device.
    (iv) Use of typical recent values. In the calculations in paragraphs 
(c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii), and (c)(1)(iii) of this section, the values used 
for the expected process activity and for the expected fraction of that 
activity whose emissions will be vented to the properly functioning 
destruction device must be based on either typical recent values for the 
process or values that would overestimate emissions from the process, 
unless there is a compelling reason to adopt a different value (e.g., 
installation of a destruction device for a previously uncontrolled 
process). If there is such a reason, it must be documented in the GHG 
Monitoring Plan.
    (v) GWPs. To convert the fluorinated GHG emissions to 
CO<INF>2</INF>e, use Equation A-1 of Sec. 98.2. For fluorinated GHGs 
whose GWPs are not listed in Table A-1 to subpart A of this part, use a 
default GWP of 2,000 unless you submit a request to use other GWPs for 
those fluorinated GHGs in that process under paragraph (c)(1)(vi) of 
this section and we approve that request.
    (vi) Request to use a GWP other than 2,000 for fluorinated GHGs 
whose GWPs are not listed in Table A-1 to subpart A of this part. If 
your process vent emits one or more fluorinated GHGs whose GWPs are not 
listed in Table A-1 to subpart A of this part, that are emitted in 
quantities that, with a default GWP of 2,000, result in total calculated 
annual emissions equal to or greater than 10,000 metric tons 
CO<INF>2</INF>e for the vent, and that you believe have GWPs that would 
result in total calculated annual emissions less than 10,000 metric tons 
CO<INF>2</INF>e for the vent, you may submit a request to use 
provisional GWPs for these fluorinated GHGs for purposes of the 
calculations in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The request must be 
submitted by February 28, 2011 for a completeness determination and 
review by EPA.
    (A) Contents of the request. You must include the following 
information in the request for each fluorinated GHG that does not have a 
GWP listed in Table A-1 to subpart A of this part and that constitutes 
more than one percent by mass of the stream emitted from the vent:
    (1) The identity of the fluorinated GHG, including its chemical 
formula and, if available, CAS number.
    (2) The estimated GWP of the fluorinated GHG.
    (3) The data and analysis that supports your estimate of the GWP of 
the fluorinated GHG, including:
    (i) Data and analysis related to the low-pressure gas phase infrared 
absorption spectrum of the fluorinated GHG.
    (ii) Data and analysis related to the estimated atmospheric lifetime 
of the fluorinated GHG (reaction mechanisms and rates, including e.g., 
photolysis and reaction with atmospheric components such as OH, 
O<INF>3,</INF> CO, and water).
    (iii) The radiative transfer analysis that integrates the lifetime 
and infrared absorption spectrum data to calculate the GWP.
    (iv) Any published or unpublished studies of the GWP of the gas.
    (4) The engineering calculations or assessments and underlying data 
that demonstrate that the process vent is calculated to emit less than 
10,000 metric tons CO<INF>2</INF>e of this and other fluorinated GHGs 
only when the proposed provisional GWPs, not the default GWP of 2,000, 
are used for fluorinated GHGs whose GWPs are not listed in Table A-1 to 
subpart A of this part.
    (B) Review and completeness determination by EPA. If EPA makes a 
preliminary determination that the request is complete, that it 
substantiates each of the provisional GWPs, and that it demonstrates 
that the process vent is calculated to emit less than 10,000 metric

[[Page 507]]

tons CO<INF>2</INF>e of this and other fluorinated GHGs only when the 
provisional GWPs, not the default GWP of 2,000, are used for fluorinated 
GHGs whose GWPs are not listed in Table A-1 to subpart A of this part, 
then EPA will publish a notice including the data and analysis submitted 
under paragraphs (c)(1)(vi)(A)(1) through (c)(1)(vi)(A)(3) of this 
section. If, after review of public comment on the notice, EPA finalizes 
its preliminary determination, then EPA will permit the facility to use 
the provisional GWPs for the calculations in paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section unless and until EPA determines that one or more of the 
provisional GWPs is in error and provides reasonable notice to the 
facility.
    (2) Method selection for continuous process vents.
    (i) If the calculations under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, as 
well as any subsequent measurements and calculations under this subpart, 
indicate that the continuous process vent has fluorinated GHG emissions 
of less than 10,000 metric ton CO<INF>2</INF>e per year, summed across 
all operating scenarios, then you may comply with either paragraph 
(c)(3) of this section (Emission Factor approach) or paragraph (c)(4) of 
this section (Emission Calculation Factor approach).
    (ii) If the continuous process vent does not meet the criteria in 
paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, then you must comply with the 
emission factor method specified in paragraph (c)(3) (Emission Factor 
approach) of this section.
    (A) You must conduct emission testing for process-vent-specific 
emission factor development before the destruction device unless the 
calculations you performed under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section 
indicate that the uncontrolled fluorinated GHG emissions that occur 
during periods when the process vent is not vented to the properly 
functioning destruction device are less than 10,000 metric tons 
CO<INF>2</INF>e per year. In this case, you may conduct emission testing 
after the destruction device to develop a process-vent-specific emission 
factor. If you do so, you must develop and apply an emission calculation 
factor under paragraph (c)(4) to estimate emissions during any periods 
when the process vent is not vented to the properly functioning 
destruction device.
    (B) Regardless of the level of uncontrolled emissions, the emission 
testing for process-vent-specific emission factor development may be 
conducted on the outlet side of a wet scrubber in place for acid gas 
reduction, if one is in place, as long as there is no appreciable 
reduction in the fluorinated GHG.
    (3) Process-vent-specific emission factor method. For each process 
vent, conduct an emission test and measure fluorinated GHG emissions 
from the process and measure the process activity, such as the feed 
rate, production rate, or other process activity rate, during the test 
as described in this paragraph (c)(3). Conduct the emission test 
according to the procedures in Sec. 98.124. All emissions test data and 
procedures used in developing emission factors must be documented 
according to Sec. 98.127. If more than one operating scenario applies 
to the process that contains the subject process vent, you must comply 
with either paragraph (3)(i) or paragraph (3)(ii) of this section.
    (i) Conduct a separate emissions test for operation under each 
operating scenario.
    (ii) Conduct an emissions test for the operating scenario that is 
expected to have the largest emissions in terms of CO<INF>2</INF>e 
(considering both activity levels and emission calculation factors) on 
an annual basis. Also conduct an emissions test for each additional 
operating scenario that is estimated to emit 10,000 metric tons 
CO<INF>2</INF>e or more annually from the vent and whose emission 
calculation factor differs by 15 percent or more from the emission 
calculation factor of the operating scenario that is expected to have 
the largest emissions (or of another operating scenario for which 
emission testing is performed), unless the difference between the 
operating scenarios is solely due to the application of a destruction 
device to emissions under one of the operating scenarios. For any other 
operating scenarios, adjust the process-vent specific emission factor 
developed for the operating scenario that is expected to have the 
largest emissions (or for another operating scenario for which emission

[[Page 508]]

testing is performed) using the approach in paragraph (c)(3)(viii) of 
this section.
    (iii) You must measure the process activity, such as the process

    (4) Process-vent-specific emission calculation factor method. For 
each process vent within an operating scenario, determine fluorinated 
GHG emissions by calculations and determine the process activity rate, 
such as the feed rate, production rate, or other process activity rate, 
associated with the emission rate.
    (i) You must calculate uncontrolled emissions of fluorinated GHG by 
individual process vent, E<INF>PV</INF>, by using measurements, by using

paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(C) of this section. The procedures in paragraphs 
(c)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section may be applied either to batch

must be based on a typical batch or production rate under a defined 
operating scenario. The process activity rate associated with the 
uncontrolled emissions must be determined. The methods, data, and 
assumptions used to estimate emissions for each operating scenario must 
be selected to yield a best estimate (expected value) of emissions 
rather than an over- or underestimate of emissions for that operating

the demonstrated destruction efficiency of the device to the fluorinated 
GHG emissions for the process vent (and operating scenario, as 
applicable), using Equation L-27 of this section. Apply the destruction 
efficiency only to the portion of the process activity that is vented to

    (d) Calculate fluorinated GHG emissions for equipment leaks (EL). If 
you comply with paragraph (c) of this section, you must calculate the 
fluorinated GHG emissions from pieces of equipment associated with 
processes covered under this subpart and in fluorinated GHG service. If 
you conduct monitoring of equipment in fluorinated GHG service, 
monitoring must be conducted for those in light liquid and in gas and 
vapor service. If you conduct monitoring of equipment in fluorinated GHG 
service, you may exclude from monitoring each piece of equipment that is 
difficult-to-monitor, that is unsafe-to-monitor, that is insulated, or 
that is in heavy liquid service; you may exclude from monitoring each 
pump with dual mechanical seals, agitator with dual mechanical seals, 
pump with no external shaft, agitator with no external shaft; you may 
exclude from monitoring each pressure relief device in gas and vapor 
service with upstream rupture disk, each sampling connection system with 
closed-loop or closed-purge systems, and any pieces of equipment where 
leaks are routed through a closed vent system to a destruction device. 
You must estimate emissions using another approach for those pieces of 
equipment excluded from monitoring. Equipment that is in fluorinated GHG 
service for less than 300 hr/yr; equipment that is in vacuum service; 
pressure relief devices that are in light liquid service; and 
instrumentation systems are exempted from these requirements.
    (1) The emissions from equipment leaks must be calculated using any 
of the procedures in paragraphs (d)(1)(i), (d)(1)(ii), (d)(1)(iii), or 
(d)(1)(iv) of this section.
    (i) Use of Average Emission Factor Approach in EPA Protocol for 
Equipment Leak Emission Estimates. The emissions from equipment leaks 
may be calculated using the default Average Emission Factor Approach in 
EPA-453/R-95-017 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 98.7).
    (ii) Use of Other Approaches in EPA Protocol for Equipment Leak 
Emission Estimates in conjunction with EPA Method 21 at 40 CFR part 60, 
appendix A-7. The emissions from equipment leaks may be calculated using 
one of the following methods in EPA-453/R-95-017 (incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 98.7): The Screening Ranges Approach; the EPA 
Correlation Approach; or the Unit-Specific Correlation Approach. If you 
determine that EPA Method 21 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7 is 
appropriate for monitoring a fluorinated GHG, and if you calibrate your 
instrument with a compound different from one or more of the fluorinated 
GHGs or surrogates to be measured, you must develop response factors for 
each fluorinated GHG or for each surrogate to be measured using EPA 
Method 21 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7. For each fluorinated GHG or 
surrogate measured, the response factor must be less than 10. The 
response factor is the ratio of the known concentration of a fluorinated 
GHG or surrogate to the observed meter reading when measured using an 
instrument calibrated with the reference compound.
    (iii) Use of Other Approaches in EPA Protocol for Equipment Leak 
Emission Estimates in conjunction with site-specific leak monitoring 
methods. The emissions from equipment leaks may be calculated using one 
of the following methods in EPA-453/R-95-017 (incorporated by reference, 
see Sec. 98.7): The Screening Ranges Approach; the EPA Correlation 
Approach; or the Unit-Specific Correlation Approach. You may develop a 
site-specific leak monitoring method appropriate for monitoring 
fluorinated GHGs or surrogates to use along with these three approaches. 
The site-specific leak monitoring method must meet the requirements in 
Sec. 98.124(f)(1).
    (iv) Use of site-specific leak monitoring methods. The emissions 
from equipment leaks may be calculated using a site-specific leak 
monitoring method. The site-specific leak monitoring method must meet 
the requirements in Sec. 98.124(f)(1).
    (2) You must collect information on the number of each type of 
equipment;

[[Page 513]]

the service of each piece of equipment (gas, light liquid, heavy 
liquid); the concentration of each fluorinated GHG in the stream; and 
the time period each piece of equipment was in service. Depending on 
which approach you follow, you may be required to collect information 
for equipment on the associated screening data concentrations for 
greater than or equal to 10,000 ppmv and associated screening data 
concentrations for less than 10,000 ppmv; associated actual screening 
data concentrations; or associated screening data and leak rate data 
(i.e., bagging) used to develop a unit-specific correlation.
    (3) Calculate and sum the emissions of each fluorinated GHG in 
metric tons per year for equipment pieces for each process, 
E<INF>ELf</INF>, annually. You must include and estimate emissions for 
types of equipment that are excluded from monitoring, including 
difficult-to-monitor, unsafe-to-monitor and insulated pieces of 
equipment, pieces of equipment in heavy liquid service, pumps with dual 
mechanical seals, agitators with dual mechanical seals, pumps with no 
external shaft, agitators with no external shaft, pressure relief 
devices in gas and vapor service with upstream rupture disk, sampling 
connection systems with closed-loop or closed purge systems, and pieces 
of equipment where leaks are routed through a closed vent system to a 
destruction device.
    (e) Calculate total fluorinated GHG emissions for each process and 
for production or transformation processes at the facility.
    (i) Estimate annually the total mass of each fluorinated GHG emitted 
from each process, including emissions from process vents in paragraphs 
(c)(3) and (c)(4) of this section, as appropriate, and from equipment 
leaks in paragraph (d), using Equation L-29 of this section.

          appropriate).
E<INF>ELfi</INF> = Mass of fluorinated GHG f emitted from equipment 
          leaks for pieces of equipment for process i, annually (kg/

    (ii) Estimate annually the total mass of each fluorinated GHG 
emitted from each type of production or transformation process at the 
facility using Equation L-30 of this section. Develop separate totals 
for fluorinated gas production processes, transformation processes that 
transform fluorinated gases produced at the facility, and transformation 
processes that transform fluorinated gases produced at another facility.

          gas production processes, all transformation processes that 
          transform fluorinated gases produced at the facility, or all 
          transformation processes that transform fluorinated gases 
          produced at another facility, as appropriate (metric tons).

          gas transformation processes that transform fluorinated gases 
          produced at the facility, or transformation processes that 
          transform fluorinated gases produced at another facility, as 
          appropriate.

    (f) Calculate fluorinated GHG emissions from destruction of 
fluorinated GHGs that were previously ``produced''. Estimate annually 
the total mass of fluorinated GHGs emitted from destruction of 
fluorinated GHGs that were previously ``produced'' as defined at Sec. 
98.410(b) using Equation L-31 of this section:

Where:

E<INF>D</INF> = The mass of fluorinated GHGs emitted annually from 
          destruction of fluorinated GHGs that were previously 
          ``produced'' as defined at Sec. 98.410(b) (metric tons).

          ``produced'' as defined at Sec. 98.410(b) and that are fed 
          annually into the destruction device (metric tons).
DE = Destruction efficiency of the destruction device (fraction).

    (g) Emissions from venting of residual fluorinated GHGs in 
containers. If you vent residual fluorinated GHGs from containers, you 
must either measure the residual fluorinated GHGs vented from each 
container or develop a heel factor for each combination of fluorinated 
GHG, container size, and container type that you vent. You do not need 
to estimate de minimis emissions associated with good-faith attempts to 
recycle or recover residual fluorinated GHGs in or from containers.
    (1) Measuring contents of each container. If you weigh or otherwise 
measure the contents of each container before venting the residual 
fluorinated GHGs, use Equation L-32 of this section to calculate annual 
emissions of each fluorinated GHG from venting of residual fluorinated 
GHG from containers. Convert pressures to masses as directed in 
paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR01DE10.050

Where:

E<INF>Cf</INF> = Total mass of each fluorinated GHG f emitted from the 
          facility through venting of residual fluorinated GHG from 
          containers, annual basis (kg/year).

          received by facility.
H<INF>Efj</INF> = Mass of residual fluorinated GHG f in container j 
          after evacuation by facility. (Facility may equate to zero.)
n = Number of vented containers for each fluorinated GHG f.

    (2) Developing and applying heel factors. If you use heel factors to 
estimate emissions of residual fluorinated GHGs vented from containers, 
you must annually develop these factors based on representative samples 
of the containers received by your facility from fluorinated GHG users.
    (i) Sample size. For each combination of fluorinated GHG, container 
size, and container type that you vent, select a representative sample 
of containers that reflects the full range of quantities of residual gas 
returned in that container size and type. This sample must reflect the 
full range of the industries and a broad range of the customers that use 
and return the fluorinated GHG, container size, and container type. The 
minimum sample size for each combination of fluorinated GHG, container 
size, and container type must be 30, unless this

[[Page 515]]

is greater than the number of containers returned within that 
combination annually, in which case the contents of every container 
returned must be measured.
    (ii) Measurement of residual gas. The residual weight or pressure 
you use for paragraph (g)(1) of this section must be determined by 
monitoring the mass or the pressure of your cylinders/containers 
according to Sec. 98.124(k). If you monitor the pressure, convert the 
pressure to mass using the ideal gas law, as displayed in Equation L-33 
of this section, with an appropriately selected Z value.

and container type, use paragraph (g)(1) of this section to calculate 
the total heel emissions for each sample selected under paragraph 
(g)(2)(i) of this section. Divide this total by the number of containers 
in the sample. Divide the result by the full capacity (the mass of the 
contents of a full container) of that combination of fluorinated GHG, 
container size, and container type. The heel factor is expressed as a 
fraction of the full capacity.
    (iv) Calculate annual emissions of each fluorinated GHG from venting 
of residual fluorinated GHG from containers using Equation L-34 of this 
section.

Sec. 98.124  Monitoring and QA/QC requirements.

    (a) Initial scoping speciation to identify fluorinated GHGs. You 
must conduct an initial scoping speciation to identify all fluorinated 
GHGs that may be generated from processes that are subject to this 
subpart and that have at least one process vent with uncontrolled 
emissions of 1.0 metric ton or more of fluorinated GHGs per year based 
on the preliminary estimate of emissions in Sec. 98.123(c)(1). You are 
not required to quantify emissions under this initial scoping 
speciation. Only fluorinated GHG products and by-products that occur in 
greater than trace concentrations in at least one stream must be 
identified under this paragraph.
    (1) Procedure. To conduct the scoping speciation, select the 
stream(s) (including process streams or destroyed streams) or process 
vent(s) that would be expected to individually or collectively contain 
all of the fluorinated GHG by-products of the process at their maximum 
concentrations and sample and analyze the contents of these selected 
streams or process vents. For example, if fluorinated GHG by-products 
are separated into one low-

boiling-point and one high-boiling-point stream, sample and analyze both 
of these streams. Alternatively, you may sample and analyze streams 
where fluorinated GHG by-products occur at less than their maximum 
concentrations, but you must ensure that the sensitivity of the analysis 
is sufficient to compensate for the expected difference in 
concentration. For example, if you sample and analyze streams where 
fluorinated GHG by-products are expected to occur at one half their 
maximum concentrations elsewhere in the process, you must ensure that 
the sensitivity of the analysis is sufficient to detect fluorinated GHG 
by-products that occur at concentrations of 0.05 percent or higher. You 
do not have to sample and analyze every stream or process vent, i.e., 
you do not have to sample and analyze a stream or process vent that 
contains only fluorinated GHGs that are contained in other streams or 
process vents that are being sampled and analyzed. Sampling and analysis 
must be conducted according to the procedures in paragraph (e) of this 
section.
    (2) Previous measurements. If you have conducted testing of streams 
(including process streams or destroyed streams) or process vents less 
than 10 years before December 31, 2010, and the testing meets the 
requirements in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, you may use the 
previous testing to satisfy this requirement.
    (b) Mass balance monitoring. If you determine fluorinated GHG 
emissions from any process using the mass balance method under Sec. 
98.123(b), you must estimate the total mass of each fluorinated GHG 
emitted from that process at least monthly. Only streams that contain 
greater than trace concentrations of fluorine-containing reactants, 
products, or by-products must be monitored under this paragraph. If you 
use an element other than fluorine in the mass-balance equation pursuant 
to Sec. 98.123(b)(3), substitute that element for fluorine in the 
monitoring requirements of this paragraph.
    (1) Mass measurements. Measure the following masses on a monthly or 
more frequent basis using flowmeters, weigh scales, or a combination of 
volumetric and density measurements with accuracies and precisions that 
allow the facility to meet the error criteria in Sec. 98.123(b)(1):
    (i) Total mass of each fluorine-containing product produced. Account 
for any used fluorine-containing product added into the production 
process upstream of the output measurement as directed at Sec. 
98.413(b) and Sec. 98.414(b). For each product, the mass produced used 
for the mass-balance calculation must be the same as the mass produced 
that is reported under subpart OO of this part, where applicable.
    (ii) Total mass of each fluorine-containing reactant fed into the 
process.
    (iii) The mass removed from the process in each stream fed into the 
destruction device.
    (iv) The mass removed from the process in each recaptured stream.
    (2) Concentration measurements for use with Sec. 98.123(b)(4). If 
you use Sec. 98.123(b)(4) to estimate the mass of fluorine in destroyed 
or recaptured streams, measure the following concentrations at least 
once each calendar month during which the process is operating, on a 
schedule to ensure that the measurements are representative of the full 
range of process conditions (e.g., catalyst age). Measure more 
frequently if this is necessary to meet the error criteria in Sec. 
98.123(b)(1). Use equipment and methods (e.g., gas chromatography) that 
comply with paragraph (e) of this section and that have an accuracy and 
precision that allow the facility to meet the error criteria in Sec. 
98.123(b)(1). Only fluorine-containing reactants, products, and by-
products that occur in a stream in greater than trace concentrations 
must be monitored under this paragraph.
    (i) The concentration (mass fraction) of the fluorine-containing 
product in each stream that is fed into the destruction device.
    (ii) The concentration (mass fraction) of each fluorine-containing 
by-product in each stream that is fed into the destruction device.
    (iii) The concentration (mass fraction) of each fluorine-containing 
reactant in each stream that is fed into the destruction device.
    (iv) The concentration (mass fraction) of each fluorine-containing 
by-

[[Page 517]]

product in each stream that is recaptured (c<INF>Bkl</INF>).
    (3) Concentration measurements for use with Sec. 98.123(b)(15). If 
you use Sec. 98.123(b)(15) to estimate the mass of fluorine in 
destroyed or recaptured streams, measure the concentrations listed in 
paragraphs (3)(i) and (ii) of this section at least once each calendar 
month during which the process is operating, on a schedule to ensure 
that the measurements are representative of the full range of process 
conditions (e.g., catalyst age). Measure more frequently if this is 
necessary to meet the error criteria in Sec. 98.123(b)(1). Use 
equipment and methods (e.g., gas chromatography) that comply with 
paragraph (e) of this section and that have an accuracy and precision 
that allow the facility to meet the error criteria in Sec. 
98.123(b)(1). Only fluorine-containing reactants, products, and by-
products that occur in a stream in greater than trace concentrations 
must be monitored under this paragraph.
    (i) The concentration (mass fraction) of total fluorine in each 
stream that is fed into the destruction device.
    (ii) The concentration (mass fraction) of total fluorine in each 
stream that is recaptured.
    (4) Emissions characterization: process vents emitting 25,000 metric 
tons CO2e or more. To characterize emissions from any process vent 
emitting 25,000 metric tons CO<INF>2</INF>e or more, comply with 
paragraphs (b)(4)(i) through (b)(4)(v) of this section, as appropriate. 
Only fluorine-containing reactants, products, and by-products that occur 
in a stream in greater than trace concentrations must be monitored under 
this paragraph.
    (i) Uncontrolled emissions. If emissions from the process vent are 
not routed through a destruction device, sample and analyze emissions at 
the process vent or stack or sample and analyze emitted streams before 
the process vent. If the process has more than one operating scenario, 
you must either perform the emission characterization for each operating 
scenario or perform the emission characterization for the operating 
scenario that is expected to have the largest emissions and adjust the 
emission characterization for other scenarios using engineering 
calculations and assessments as specified in Sec. 98.123(c)(4). To 
perform the characterization, take three samples under conditions that 
are representative for the operating scenario. Measure the concentration 
of each fluorine-containing compound in each sample. Use equipment and 
methods that comply with paragraph (e) of this section. Calculate the 
average concentration of each fluorine-containing compound across all 
three samples.
    (ii) Controlled emissions using Sec. 98.123(b)(15). If you use 
Sec. 98.123(b)(15) to estimate the total mass of fluorine in destroyed 
or recaptured streams, and if the emissions from the process vent are 
routed through a destruction device, characterize emissions as specified 
in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section before the destruction device. 
Apply the destruction efficiency demonstrated for each fluorinated GHG 
in the destroyed stream to that fluorinated GHG. Exclude from the 
characterization fluorine-containing compounds that are not fluorinated 
GHGs.
    (iii) Controlled emissions using Sec. 98.123(b)(4). If you use 
Sec. 98.123(b)(4) to estimate the mass of fluorine in destroyed or 
recaptured streams, and if the emissions from the process vent are 
routed through a destruction device, characterize the process vent's 
emissions monthly (or more frequently) using the monthly (or more 
frequent) measurements under paragraphs (b)(1)(iii) and (b)(2)(i) 
through (b)(2)(iii) of this section. Apply the destruction efficiency 
demonstrated for each fluorinated GHG in the destroyed stream to that 
fluorinated GHG. Exclude from the characterization fluorine-containing 
compounds that are not fluorinated GHGs.
    (iv) Emissions characterization frequency. You must repeat emission 
characterizations performed under paragraph (b)(4)(i) and (b)(4)(ii) of 
this section under paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(A) or (b)(4)(iv)(B) of this 
section, whichever occurs first:
    (A) 10-year revision. Repeat the emission characterization every 10 
years. In the calculations under Sec. 98.123, apply the revised 
emission characterization to the process activity that occurs after the 
revision.
    (B) Operating scenario change that affects the emission 
characterization. For

[[Page 518]]

planned operating scenario changes, you must estimate and compare the 
emission calculation factors for the changed operating scenario and for 
the original operating scenario whose process vent specific emission 
factor was measured. Use the engineering calculations and assessments 
specified in Sec. 98.123(c)(4). If the share of total fluorine-
containing compound emissions represented by any fluorinated GHG changes 
under the changed operating scenario by 15 percent or more of the total, 
relative to the previous operating scenario (this includes the 
cumulative change in the emission calculation factor since the last 
emissions test), you must repeat the emission characterization. Perform 
the emission characterization before February 28 of the year that 
immediately follows the change. In the calculations under Sec. 98.123, 
apply the revised emission characterization to the process activity that 
occurs after the operating scenario change.
    (v) Subsequent measurements. If a process vent with fluorinated GHG 
emissions less than 25,000 metric tons CO<INF>2</INF>e, per Sec. 
98.123(c)(2), is later found to have fluorinated GHG emissions of 25,000 
metric tons CO<INF>2</INF>e or greater, you must perform an emission 
characterization under this paragraph during the following year.
    (5) Emissions characterization: process vents emitting less than 
25,000 metric tons CO<INF>2</INF>e. To characterize emissions from any 
process vent emitting less than 25,000 metric tons CO<INF>2</INF>e, 
comply with paragraphs (b)(5)(i) through (b)(5)(iii) of this section, as 
appropriate. Only fluorine-containing reactants, products, and by-
products that occur in a stream in greater than trace concentrations 
must be monitored under this paragraph.
    (i) Uncontrolled emissions. If emissions from the process vent are 
not routed through a destruction device, emission measurements must 
consist of sampling and analysis of emissions at the process vent or 
stack, sampling and analysis of emitted streams before the process vent, 
previous test results, provided the tests are representative of current 
operating conditions of the process, or bench-scale or pilot-scale test 
data representative of the process operating conditions.
    (ii) Controlled emissions using Sec. 98.123(b)(15). If you use 
Sec. 98.123(b)(15) to estimate the total mass of fluorine in destroyed 
or recaptured streams, and if the emissions from the process vent are 
routed through a destruction device, characterize emissions as specified 
in paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section before the destruction device. 
Apply the destruction efficiency demonstrated for each fluorinated GHG 
in the destroyed stream to that fluorinated GHG. Exclude from the 
characterization fluorine-containing compounds that are not fluorinated 
GHGs.
    (iii) Controlled emissions using Sec. 98.123(b)(4). If you use 
Sec. 98.123(b)(4) to estimate the mass of fluorine in destroyed or 
recaptured streams, and if the emissions from the process vent are 
routed through a destruction device, characterize the process vent's 
emissions monthly (or more frequently) using the monthly (or more 
frequent) measurements under paragraphs (b)(1)(iii) and (b)(2)(i) 
through (b)(2)(iii) of this section. Apply the destruction efficiency 
demonstrated for each fluorinated GHG in the destroyed stream to that 
fluorinated GHG. Exclude from the characterization fluorine-containing 
compounds that are not fluorinated GHGs.
    (6) Emissions characterization: emissions not accounted for by 
process vent estimates. Calculate the weighted average emission 
characterization across the process vents before any destruction 
devices. Apply the weighted average emission characterization for all 
the process vents to any fluorine emissions that are not accounted for 
by process vent estimates.
    (7) Impurities in reactants. If any fluorine-containing impurity is 
fed into a process along with a reactant (or other input) in greater 
than trace concentrations, this impurity shall be monitored under this 
section and included in the calculations under Sec. 98.123 in the same 
manner as reactants fed into the process, fed into the destruction 
device, recaptured, or emitted, except the concentration of the impurity 
in the mass fed into the process shall be measured, and the mass of the 
impurity fed into the process shall be calculated as the

[[Page 519]]

product of the concentration of the impurity and the mass fed into the 
process. The mass of the reactant fed into the process may be reduced to 
account for the mass of the impurity.
    (8) Alternative to error calculation. As an alternative to 
calculating the relative and absolute errors associated with the 
estimate of emissions under Sec. 98.123(b), you may comply with the 
precision, accuracy, measurement and calculation frequency, and 
fluorinated GHG throughput requirements of paragraph (b)(8)(i) through 
(b)(8)(iv) of this section.
    (i) Mass measurements. Measure the masses specified in paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section using flowmeters, weigh scales, or a combination 
of volumetric and density measurements with accuracies and precisions of 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.2 percent of full scale or better.
    (ii) Concentration measurements. Measure the concentrations 
specified in paragraph (b)(2) or paragraph (b)(3) of this section, as 
applicable, using analytical methods with accuracies and precisions of 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>10 percent or better.
    (iii) Measurement and calculation frequency. Perform the mass 
measurements specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and the 
concentration measurements specified in paragraph (b)(2) or paragraph 
(b)(3) of this section, as applicable, at least weekly, and calculate 
emissions at least weekly.
    (iv) Fluorinated-GHG throughput limit. You may use the alternative 
to the error calculation specified in paragraph (b)(8) of this section 
only if the total annual CO<INF>2</INF>-equivalent fluorinated GHG 
throughput of the process is 500,000 mtCO<INF>2</INF>e or less. The 
total throughput is the sum of the masses of the fluorinated GHG 
reactants, products, and by-products fed into and generated by the 
process. To convert these masses to CO<INF>2</INF>e, use Equation A-1 of 
Sec. 98.2. For fluorinated GHGs whose GWPs are not listed in Table A-1 
to subpart A of this part, use a default GWP of 2,000.
    (c) Emission factor testing. If you determine fluorinated GHG 
emissions using the site-specific process-vent-specific emission factor, 
you must meet the requirements in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(8) of 
this section.
    (1) Process vent testing. Conduct an emissions test that is based on 
representative performance of the process or operating scenario(s) of 
the process, as applicable. Include in the emission test any fluorinated 
greenhouse gas that occurs in more than trace concentrations in the vent 
stream or, where a destruction device is used, in the inlet to the 
destruction device. You may include startup and shutdown events if the 
testing is sufficiently long or comprehensive to ensure that such events 
are not overrepresented in the emission factor. Malfunction events must 
not be included in the testing. If you conduct your emission testing 
after a destruction device, and if the outlet concentration of a 
fluorinated GHG that is fed into the device is below the detection limit 
of the method, you may use a concentration of one-half the detection 
limit to estimate the emission factor.
    (2) Number of runs. For continuous processes, sample the process 
vent for a minimum of 3 runs of 1 hour each. If the RSD of the emission 
factor calculated based on the first 3 runs is greater than or equal to 
0.15 for the emission factor, continue to sample the process vent for an 
additional 3 runs of 1 hour each. If more than one fluorinated GHG is 
measured, the RSD must be expressed in terms of total CO<INF>2</INF> 
equivalents. For fluorinated GHGs whose GWPs are not listed in Table A-1 
to subpart A of this part, use a default GWP of 2,000 in the RSD 
calculation.
    (3) Process activity measurements. Determine the mass rate of 
process feed, process production, or other process activity as 
applicable during the test using flow meters, weigh scales, or other 
measurement devices or instruments with an accuracy and precision of 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>1 percent of full scale or better. These devices 
may be the same plant instruments or procedures that are used for 
accounting purposes (such as weigh hoppers, belt weigh feeders, 
combination of volume measurements and bulk density, etc.) if these 
devices or procedures meet the requirement. For monitoring ongoing 
process activity, use flow meters, weigh scales, or other measurement 
devices or instruments

[[Page 520]]

with an accuracy and precision of <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>1 percent of 
full scale or better.
    (4) Sample each process. If process vents from separate processes 
are manifolded together to a common vent or to a common destruction 
device, you must follow paragraph (c)(4)(i), (c)(4)(ii), or (c)(4)(iii) 
of this section.
    (i) You may sample emissions from each process in the ducts before 
the emissions are combined.
    (ii) You may sample in the common duct or at the outlet of the 
destruction device when only one process is operating.
    (iii) You may sample the combined emissions and use engineering 
calculations and assessments as specified in Sec. 98.123(c)(4) to 
allocate the emissions to each manifolded process vent, provided the sum 
of the calculated fluorinated GHG emissions across the individual 
process vents is within 20 percent of the total fluorinated GHG 
emissions measured during the manifolded testing.
    (5) Emission test results. The results of an emission test must 
include the analysis of samples, number of test runs, the results of the 
RSD analysis, the analytical method used, determination of emissions, 
the process activity, and raw data and must identify the process, the 
operating scenario, the process vents tested, and the fluorinated GHGs 
that were included in the test (i.e., the fluorinated GHGs that occur in 
more than trace concentrations in the vent stream or, where a 
destruction device is used, in the inlet to the destruction device, and 
any other fluorinated GHGs included in the test). The emissions test 
report must contain all information and data used to derive the process-
vent-specific emission factor, as well as key process conditions during 
the test. Key process conditions include those that are normally 
monitored for process control purposes and may include but are not 
limited to yields, pressures, temperatures, etc. (e.g., of reactor 
vessels, distillation columns).
    (7) Emissions testing frequency. You must conduct emissions testing 
to develop the process-vent-specific emission factor under paragraph 
(c)(7)(i) or (c)(7)(ii) of this section, whichever occurs first:
    (i) 10-year revision. Conduct an emissions test every 10 years. In 
the calculations under Sec. 98.123, apply the revised process-vent-
specific emission factor to the process activity that occurs after the 
revision.
    (ii) Operating scenario change that affects the emission factor. For 
planned operating scenario changes, you must estimate and compare the 
emission calculation factors for the changed operating scenario and for 
the original operating scenario whose process vent specific emission 
factor was measured. Use the calculation methods in Sec. 98.123(c)(4). 
If the emission calculation factor for the changed operating scenario is 
15 percent or more different from the emission calculation factor for 
the previous operating scenario (this includes the cumulative change in 
the emission calculation factor since the last emissions test), you must 
conduct an emissions test to update the process-vent-specific emission 
factor, unless the difference between the operating scenarios is solely 
due to the application of a destruction device to emissions under the 
changed operating scenario. Conduct the test before February 28 of the 
year that immediately follows the change. In the calculations under 
Sec. 98.123, apply the revised process-vent-specific emission factor to 
the process activity that occurs after the operating scenario change.
    (8) Subsequent measurements. If a continuous process vent with 
fluorinated GHG emissions less than 10,000 metric tons CO<INF>2</INF>e, 
per Sec. 98.123(c)(2), is later found to have fluorinated GHG emissions 
of 10,000 metric tons CO<INF>2</INF>e or greater, you must conduct the 
emissions testing for the process vent during the following year and 
develop the process-vent-specific emission factor from the emissions 
testing.
    (9) Previous measurements. If you have conducted an emissions test 
less than 10 years before December 31, 2010, and the emissions testing 
meets the requirements in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(8) of this 
section, you may use the previous emissions testing to develop process-
vent-specific emission factors. For purposes of paragraph (c)(7)(i) of 
this section, the date of the

[[Page 521]]

previous emissions test rather than December 31, 2010 shall constitute 
the beginning of the 10-year re-measurement cycle.
    (d) Emission calculation factor monitoring. If you determine 
fluorinated GHG emissions using the site-specific process-vent-specific 
emission calculation factor, you must meet the requirements in 
paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(4) of this section.
    (1) Operating scenario. Perform the emissions calculation for the 
process vent based on representative performance of the operating 
scenario of the process. If more than one operating scenario applies to 
the process that contains the subject process vent, you must conduct a 
separate emissions calculation for operation under each operating 
scenario. For each continuous process vent that contains more than trace 
concentrations of any fluorinated GHG and for each batch process vent 
that contains more than trace concentrations of any fluorinated GHG, 
develop the process-vent-specific emission calculation factor for each 
operating scenario. For continuous process vents, determine the 
emissions based on the process activity for the representative 
performance of the operating scenario. For batch process vents, 
determine emissions based on the process activity for each typical batch 
operating scenario.
    (2) Process activity measurements. Use flow meters, weigh scales, or 
other measurement devices or instruments with an accuracy and precision 
of <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>1 percent of full scale or better for 
monitoring ongoing process activity.
    (3) Emission calculation results. The emission calculation must be 
documented by identifying the process, the operating scenario, and the 
process vents. The documentation must contain the information and data 
used to calculate the process-vent-specific emission calculation factor.
    (4) Operating scenario change that affects the emission calculation 
factor. For planned operating scenario changes that are expected to 
change the process-vent-specific emission calculation factor, you must 
conduct an emissions calculation to update the process-vent-specific 
emission calculation factor. In the calculations under Sec. 98.123, 
apply the revised emission calculation factor to the process activity 
that occurs after the operating scenario change.
    (5) Previous calculations. If you have performed an emissions 
calculation for the process vent and operating scenario less than 10 
years before December 31, 2010, and the emissions calculation meets the 
requirements in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(4) of this section and in 
Sec. 98.123(c)(4)(i) and (c)(4)(ii), you may use the previous 
calculation to develop the site-specific process-vent-specific emission 
calculation factor.
    (e) Emission and stream testing, including analytical methods. 
Select and document testing and analytical methods as follows:
    (1) Sampling and mass measurement for emission testing. For emission 
testing in process vents or at the stack, use methods for sampling, 
measuring volumetric flow rates, non-fluorinated-GHG gas analysis, and 
measuring stack gas moisture that have been validated using a 
scientifically sound validation protocol.
    (i) Sample and velocity traverses. Acceptable methods include but 
are not limited to EPA Method 1 or 1A in Appendix A-1 of 40 CFR part 60.
    (ii) Velocity and volumetric flow rates. Acceptable methods include 
but are not limited to EPA Method 2, 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D, 2F, or 2G in 
Appendix A-1 of 40 CFR part 60. Alternatives that may be used for 
determining flow rates include OTM-24 (incorporated by reference, see 
Sec. 98.7) and ALT-012 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 98.7).
    (iii) Non-fluorinated-GHG gas analysis. Acceptable methods include 
but are not limited to EPA Method 3, 3A, or 3B in Appendix A-1 of 40 CFR 
part 60.
    (iv) Stack gas moisture. Acceptable methods include but are not 
limited to EPA Method 4 in Appendix A-1 of 40 CFR part 60.
    (2) Analytical methods. Use a quality-assured analytical measurement 
technology capable of detecting the analyte of interest at the 
concentration of interest and use a sampling and analytical procedure 
validated with the analyte of interest at the concentration of interest. 
Where calibration standards for the analyte are not available, a 
chemically similar surrogate

[[Page 522]]

may be used. Acceptable analytical measurement technologies include but 
are not limited to gas chromatography (GC) with an appropriate detector, 
infrared (IR), fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and nuclear magnetic 
resonance (NMR). Acceptable methods for determining fluorinated GHGs 
include EPA Method 18 in appendix A-1 of 40 CFR part 60, EPA Method 320 
in appendix A of 40 CFR part 63, EPA 430-R-10-003 (incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 98.7), ASTM D6348-03 (incorporated by reference, 
see Sec. 98.7), or other analytical methods validated using EPA Method 
301 at 40 CFR part 63, appendix A or some other scientifically sound 
validation protocol. Acceptable methods for determining total fluorine 
concentrations for fluorine-containing compounds in streams under 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section include ASTM D7359-08 (incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 98.7), or other analytical methods validated using 
EPA Method 301 at 40 CFR part 63, appendix A or some other 
scientifically sound validation protocol. The validation protocol may 
include analytical technology manufacturer specifications or 
recommendations.
    (3) Documentation in GHG Monitoring Plan. Describe the sampling, 
measurement, and analytical method(s) used under paragraphs (e)(1) and 
(e)(2) of this section in the GHG Monitoring Plan as required under 
Sec. 98.3(g)(5). Identify the methods used to obtain the samples and 
measurements listed under paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (e)(1)(iv) of 
this section. At a minimum, include in the description of the analytical 
method a description of the analytical measurement equipment and 
procedures, quantitative estimates of the method's accuracy and 
precision for the analytes of interest at the concentrations of 
interest, as well as a description of how these accuracies and 
precisions were estimated, including the validation protocol used.
    (f) Emission monitoring for pieces of equipment. If you conduct a 
site-specific leak detection method or monitoring approach for pieces of 
equipment, follow paragraph (f)(1) or (f)(2) of this section and follow 
paragraph (f)(3) of this section.
    (1) Site-specific leak monitoring approach. You may develop a site-
specific leak monitoring approach. You must validate the leak monitoring 
method and describe the method and the validation in the GHG Monitoring 
Plan. To validate the site-specific method, you may, for example, 
release a known rate of the fluorinated GHGs or surrogates of interest, 
or you may compare the results of the site-specific method to those of a 
method that has been validated for the fluorinated GHGs or surrogates of 
interest. In the description of the leak detection method and its 
validation, include a detailed description of the method, including the 
procedures and equipment used and any sampling strategies. Also include 
the rationale behind the method, including why the method is expected to 
result in an unbiased estimate of emissions from equipment leaks. If the 
method is based on methods that are used to detect or quantify leaks or 
other emissions in other regulations, standards, or guidelines, identify 
and describe the regulations, standards, or guidelines and why their 
methods are applicable to emissions of fluorinated GHGs or surrogates 
from leaks. Account for possible sources of error in the method, e.g., 
instrument detection limits, measurement biases, and sampling biases. 
Describe validation efforts, including but not limited to any 
comparisons against standard leaks or concentrations, any comparisons 
against other methods, and their results. If you use the Screening 
Ranges Approach, the EPA Correlation Approach, or the Unit-Specific 
Correlation Approach with a monitoring instrument that does not meet all 
of the specifications in EPA Method 21 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, 
then explain how and why the monitoring instrument, as used at your 
facility, would nevertheless be expected to accurately detect and 
quantify emissions of fluorinated GHGs or surrogates from process 
equipment, and describe how you verified its accuracy. For all methods, 
provide a quantitative estimate of the accuracy and precision of the 
method.
    (2) EPA Method 21 monitoring. If you determine that EPA Method 21 at 
40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7 is appropriate for monitoring a fluorinated

[[Page 523]]

GHG, conduct the screening value concentration measurements using EPA 
Method 21 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7 to determine the screening 
range data or the actual screening value data for the Screening Ranges 
Approach, EPA Correlation Approach, or the Unit-Specific Correlation 
Approach. For the one-time testing to develop the Unit-Specific 
Correlation equations in EPA-453/R-95-017 (incorporated by reference, 
see Sec. 98.7), conduct the screening value concentration measurements 
using EPA Method 21 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7 and the bagging 
procedures to measure mass emissions. Concentration measurements of 
bagged samples must be conducted using gas chromatography following EPA 
Method 18 analytical procedures or other method according to Sec. 
98.124(e). Use methane or other appropriate compound as the calibration 
gas.
    (3) Frequency of measurement and sampling. If you estimate emissions 
based on monitoring of equipment, conduct monitoring at least annually. 
Sample at least one-third of equipment annually (except for equipment 
that is unsafe-to-monitor, difficult-to-monitor, insulated, or in heavy 
liquid service, pumps with dual mechanical seals, agitators with dual 
mechanical seals, pumps with no external shaft, agitators with no 
external shaft, pressure relief devices in gas and vapor service with an 
upstream rupture disk, sampling connection systems with closed-loop or 
closed purge systems, and pieces of equipment whose leaks are routed 
through a closed vent system to a destruction device), changing the 
sample each year such that at the end of three years, all equipment in 
the process has been monitored. If you estimate emissions based on a 
sample of the equipment in the process, ensure that the sample is 
representative of the equipment in the process. If you have multiple 
processes that have similar types of equipment in similar service, and 
that produce or transform similar fluorinated GHGs (in terms of chemical 
composition, molecular weight, and vapor pressure) at similar pressures 
and concentrations, then you may annually sample all of the equipment in 
one third of these processes rather than one third of the equipment in 
each process.
    (g) Destruction device performance testing. If you vent or otherwise 
feed fluorinated GHGs into a destruction device and apply the 
destruction efficiency of the device to one or more fluorinated GHGs in 
Sec. 98.123, you must conduct emissions testing to determine the 
destruction efficiency for each fluorinated GHG to which you apply the 
destruction efficiency. You must either determine the destruction 
efficiency for the most-difficult-to-destroy fluorinated GHG fed into 
the device (or a surrogate that is still more difficult to destroy) and 
apply that destruction efficiency to all the fluorinated GHGs fed into 
the device or alternatively determine different destruction efficiencies 
for different groups of fluorinated GHGs using the most-difficult-to-
destroy fluorinated GHG of each group (or a surrogate that is still more 
difficult to destroy).
    (1) Destruction efficiency testing. You must sample the inlet and 
outlet of the destruction device for a minimum of three runs of 1 hour 
each to determine the destruction efficiency. You must conduct the 
emissions testing using the methods in paragraph (e) of this section. To 
determine the destruction efficiency, emission testing must be conducted 
when operating at high loads reasonably expected to occur (i.e., 
representative of high total fluorinated GHG load that will be sent to 
the device) and when destroying the most-difficult-to-destroy 
fluorinated GHG (or a surrogate that is still more difficult to destroy) 
that is fed into the device from the processes subject to this subpart 
or that belongs to the group of fluorinated GHGs for which you wish to 
establish a DE. If the outlet concentration of a fluorinated GHG that is 
fed into the device is below the detection limit of the method, you may 
use a concentration of one-half the detection limit to estimate the 
destruction efficiency.
    (i) If perfluoromethane (CF<INF>4</INF>) is vented to the 
destruction device in any stream in more than trace concentrations, you 
must test and determine the destruction efficiency achieved specifically 
for CF<INF>4</INF> to take credit for the CF<INF>4</INF> emissions 
reduction.

[[Page 524]]

    (ii) If sulfur hexafluoride (SF<INF>6</INF>) is vented to the 
destruction device in any stream in more than trace concentrations, you 
must test and determine the destruction efficiency achieved specifically 
for SF<INF>6</INF>, or alternatively for CF<INF>4</INF> as a surrogate, 
to take credit for the SF<INF>6</INF> emissions reduction.
    (iii) If saturated perfluorocarbons other than CF<INF>4</INF> are 
vented to the destruction device in any stream in more than trace 
concentrations, you must test and determine the destruction efficiency 
achieved for the lowest molecular weight saturated perfluorocarbon 
vented to the destruction device, or alternatively for a lower molecular 
weight saturated PFC or SF<INF>6</INF> as a surrogate, to take credit 
for the PFC emission reduction.
    (iv) For all other fluorinated GHGs that are vented to the 
destruction device in any stream in more than trace concentrations, you 
must test and determine the destruction efficiency achieved for the 
most-difficult-to-destroy fluorinated GHG or surrogate vented to the 
destruction device. Examples of acceptable surrogates include the Class 
1 compounds (ranked 1 through 34) in Appendix D, Table D-1 of ``Guidance 
on Setting Permit Conditions and Reporting Trial Burn Results; Volume II 
of the Hazardous Waste Incineration Guidance Series,'' January 1989, EPA 
Publication EPA 625/6-89/019. You can obtain a copy of this publication 
by contacting the Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania 
Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20460, (202) 272-0167, http://www.epa.gov.
    (2) Destruction efficiency testing frequency. You must conduct 
emissions testing to determine the destruction efficiency as provided in 
paragraphs (g)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section, whichever occurs first:
    (i) Conduct an emissions test every 10 years. In the calculations 
under Sec. 98.123, apply the updated destruction efficiency to the 
destruction that occurs after the test.
    (ii) Destruction device changes that affect the destruction 
efficiency. If you make a change to the destruction device that would be 
expected to affect the destruction efficiency, you must conduct an 
emissions test to update the destruction efficiency. Conduct the test 
before the February 28 of the year that immediately follows the change. 
In the calculations under Sec. 98.123, apply the updated destruction 
efficiency to the destruction that occurs after the change to the 
device.
    (3) Previous testing .If you have conducted an emissions test within 
the 10 years prior to December 31, 2010, and the emissions testing meets 
the requirements in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, you may use the 
destruction efficiency determined during this previous emissions 
testing. For purposes of paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section, the date 
of the previous emissions test rather than December 31, 2010 shall 
constitute the beginning of the 10-year re-measurement cycle.
    (4) Hazardous Waste Combustor testing. If a destruction device used 
to destroy fluorinated GHG is subject to subpart EEE of part 63 of this 
chapter or any portion of parts 260-270 of this chapter, you may apply 
the destruction efficiency specifically determined for CF<INF>4</INF>, 
SF<INF>6</INF>, PFCs other than CF<INF>4</INF>, and all other 
fluorinated GHGs under that test if the testing meets the criteria in 
paragraph (g)(1)(i) through (g)(1)(iv) of this section. If the testing 
of the destruction efficiency under subpart EEE of part 63 of this 
chapter was conducted more than 10 years ago, you may use the most 
recent destruction efficiency test provided that the design, operation, 
or maintenance of the destruction device has not changed since the last 
destruction efficiency test in a manner that could affect the ability to 
achieve the destruction efficiency, and the hazardous waste is fed into 
the normal flame zone.
    (h) Mass of previously produced fluorinated GHGs fed into 
destruction device. You must measure the mass of each fluorinated GHG 
that is fed into the destruction device in more than trace 
concentrations and that was previously produced as defined at Sec. 
98.410(b). Such fluorinated GHGs include but are not limited to 
quantities that are shipped to the facility by another facility for 
destruction and quantities that are returned to the facility for 
reclamation but are found to be irretrievably contaminated and are 
therefore destroyed. You must use

[[Page 525]]

flowmeters, weigh scales, or a combination of volumetric and density 
measurements with an accuracy and precision of <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>1 
percent of full scale or better. If the measured mass includes more than 
trace concentrations of materials other than the fluorinated GHG being 
destroyed, you must measure the concentration of the fluorinated GHG 
being destroyed. You must multiply this concentration (mass fraction) by 
the mass measurement to obtain the mass of the fluorinated GHG fed into 
the destruction device.
    (i) Emissions due to malfunctions of destruction device. In their 
estimates of the mass of fluorinated GHG destroyed, fluorinated gas 
production facilities that destroy fluorinated GHGs must account for any 
temporary reductions in the destruction efficiency that result from any 
malfunctions of the destruction device, including periods of operation 
outside of the operating conditions defined in operating permit 
requirements and/or destruction device manufacturer specifications.
    (j) Emissions due to process startup, shutdown, or malfunctions. 
Fluorinated GHG production facilities must account for fluorinated GHG 
emissions that occur as a result of startups, shutdowns, and 
malfunctions, either recording fluorinated GHG emissions during these 
events, or documenting that these events do not result in significant 
fluorinated GHG emissions. Facilities may use the calculation methods in 
Sec. 98.123(c)(1) to estimate emissions during startups, shutdowns, and 
malfunctions.
    (k) Monitoring for venting residual fluorinated GHG in containers. 
Measure the residual fluorinated GHG in containers received by the 
facility either using scales or using pressure and temperature 
measurements. You may use pressure and temperature measurements only in 
cases where no liquid fluorinated GHG is present in the container. 
Scales must have an accuracy and precision of <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>1 
percent or better of the filled weight (gas plus tare) of the containers 
of fluorinated GHGs that are typically weighed on the scale. For 
example, for scales that are generally used to weigh cylinders that 
contain 115 pounds of gas when full and that have a tare weight of 115 
pounds, this equates to <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>1 percent of 230 pounds, 
or <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2.3 pounds. Pressure gauges and thermometers 
used to measure quantities that are monitored under this paragraph must 
have an accuracy and precision of <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>1 percent of 
full scale or better.
    (l) Initial scoping speciations, emissions testing, emission factor 
development, emission calculation factor development, emission 
characterization development, and destruction efficiency determinations 
must be completed by February 29, 2012 for processes and operating 
scenarios that operate between December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2011. 
For other processes and operating scenarios, initial scoping 
speciations, emissions testing, emission factor development, emission 
calculation factor development, emission characterization development, 
and destruction efficiency determinations must be complete by February 
28 of the year following the year in which the process or operating 
scenario commences or recommences.
    (m) Calibrate all flow meters, weigh scales, and combinations of 
volumetric and density measures using monitoring instruments traceable 
to the International System of Units (SI) through the National Institute 
of Standards and Technology (NIST) or other recognized national 
measurement institute. Recalibrate all flow meters, weigh scales, and 
combinations of volumetric and density measures at the minimum frequency 
specified by the manufacturer. Use any of the following applicable flow 
meter test methods or the calibration procedures specified by the flow 
meter, weigh-scale, or other volumetric or density measure manufacturer.

    (n) All analytical equipment used to determine the concentration of 
fluorinated GHGs, including but not limited to gas chromatographs and 
associated detectors, infrared (IR), fourier transform infrared (FTIR), 
and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) devices, must be calibrated at a 
frequency needed to support the type of analysis specified in the GHG 
Monitoring Plan as required under Sec. 98.124(e)(3) and 93.3(g)(5). 
Quality assurance samples at the concentrations of concern must be used 
for the calibration. Such quality assurance samples must consist of or 
be prepared from certified standards of the analytes of concern where 
available; if not available, calibration must be performed by a method 
specified in the GHG Monitoring Plan.
    (o) Special provisions for estimating 2011 and subsequent year 
emissions.
    (1) Best available monitoring methods. To estimate emissions that 
occur from January 1, 2011 through June 30, 2011, owners or operators 
may use best available monitoring methods for any parameter that cannot 
reasonably be measured according to the monitoring and QA/QC 
requirements of this subpart. The owner or operator must use the 
calculation methodologies and equations in Sec. 98.123, but may use the 
best available monitoring method for any parameter for which it is not 
reasonably feasible to acquire, install, or operate a required piece of 
monitoring equipment, to procure measurement services from necessary 
providers, or to gain physical access to make required measurements in a 
facility by January 1, 2011. Starting no later than July 1, 2011, the 
owner or operator must discontinue using best available methods and 
begin following all applicable monitoring and QA/QC requirements of this 
part, except as provided in paragraphs (o)(2) through (o)(4) of this 
section. Best available monitoring methods means any of the following 
methods specified in this paragraph:
    (i) Monitoring methods currently used by the facility that do not 
meet the specifications of this subpart.
    (ii) Supplier data.
    (iii) Engineering calculations or assessments.
    (iv) Other company records.
    (2) Requests for extension of the use of best available monitoring 
methods to estimate 2011 emissions: parameters other than scoping 
speciations, emission factors, and emission characterizations. The owner 
or operator may submit a request to the Administrator to use one or more 
best available monitoring methods for parameters other than scoping 
speciations, emission factors, or emission characterizations to estimate 
emissions that occur between July 1, 2011 and December 31, 2011.
    (i) Timing of request. The extension request must be submitted to 
EPA no later than February 28, 2011.
    (ii) Content of request. Requests must contain the following 
information:
    (A) A list of specific items of monitoring equipment and measurement 
services for which the request is being made and the locations (e.g., 
processes and vents) where each piece of monitoring equipment will be 
installed and where each measurement service will be provided.
    (B) Identification of the specific rule requirements for which the 
monitoring equipment or measurement service is needed.
    (C) A description of the reasons why the needed equipment could not 
be obtained, installed, or operated or why the needed measurement 
service could not be provided before July 1, 2011. The owner or operator 
must consider all of the data collection and emission calculation 
options outlined in the rule for a specific emissions source before

[[Page 527]]

claiming that a specific safety, technical, logistical, or legal barrier 
exists.
    (D) If the reason for the extension is that the equipment cannot be 
purchased, delivered, or installed before July 1, 2011, include 
supporting documentation such as the date the monitoring equipment was 
ordered, investigation of alternative suppliers, the dates by which 
alternative vendors promised delivery or installation, backorder notices 
or unexpected delays, descriptions of actions taken to expedite delivery 
or installation, and the current expected date of delivery or 
installation.
    (E) If the reason for the extension is that service providers were 
unable to provide necessary measurement services, include supporting 
documentation demonstrating that these services could not be acquired 
before July 1, 2011. This documentation must include written 
correspondence to and from at least two service providers stating that 
they will not be able to provide the necessary services before July 1, 
2011.
    (F) If the reason for the extension is that the process is operating 
continuously without process shutdown, include supporting documentation 
showing that it is not practicable to isolate the process equipment or 
unit and install the measurement device without a full shutdown or a hot 
tap, and that there is no opportunity before July 1, 2011 to install the 
device. Include the date of the three most recent shutdowns for each 
relevant process equipment or unit, the frequency of shutdowns for each 
relevant process equipment or unit, and the date of the next planned 
process equipment or unit shutdown.
    (G) If the reason for the extension is that access to process 
streams, emissions streams, or destroyed streams, as applicable, could 
not be gained before July 1, 2011 for reasons other than the continuous 
operation of the process without shutdown, include illustrative 
documentation such as photographs and engineering diagrams demonstrating 
that access could not be gained.
    (H) A description of the best available monitoring methods that will 
be used and how their results will be applied (i.e., which calculation 
method will be used) to develop the emission estimate. Where the 
proposed best available monitoring method is the use of current 
monitoring data in the mass-balance approach, include the estimated 
relative and absolute errors of the mass-balance approach using the 
current monitoring data.
    (I) A description of the specific actions the owner or operator will 
take to comply with monitoring requirements by January 1, 2012.
    (3) Requests for extension of the use of best available monitoring 
methods to estimate 2011 emissions: scoping speciations, emission 
factors, and emission characterizations. The owner or operator may 
submit a request to the Administrator to use one or more best available 
monitoring methods for scoping speciations, emission factors, and 
emission characterizations to estimate emissions that occur between July 
1, 2011 and December 31, 2011.
    (i) Timing of request. The extension request must be submitted to 
EPA no later than June 30, 2011.
    (ii) Content of request. Requests must contain the information 
outlined in paragraph (o)(2)(ii) of this section, substituting March 1, 
2012 for July 1, 2011 and substituting March 1, 2013 for January 1, 
2012.
    (iii) Reporting of 2011 emissions using scoping speciations, 
emission factors, and emission characterizations developed after 
February 29, 2012. Facilities that are approved to use best available 
monitoring methods in 2011 for scoping speciations, emission factors, or 
emission characterizations for certain processes must submit, by March 
31, 2013, revised 2011 emission estimates that reflect the scoping 
speciations, emission factors, and emission characterizations that are 
measured for those processes after February 29, 2012. If the operating 
scenario for 2011 is different from all of the operating scenarios for 
which emission factors are developed after February 29, 2012, use 
Equation L-23 at Sec. 98.123(c)(3)(viii) to adjust the emission 
factor(s) or emission characterizations measured for the post-February 
29, 2012 operating scenario(s) to account for the differences.
    (4) Requests for extension of the use of best available monitoring 
methods to estimate emissions that occur after 2011. EPA

[[Page 528]]

does not anticipate approving the use of best available monitoring 
methods to estimate emissions that occur beyond December 31, 2011; 
however, EPA reserves the right to review requests for unique and 
extreme circumstances which include safety, technical infeasibility, or 
inconsistency with other local, State or Federal regulations.
    (i) Timing of request. The extension request must be submitted to 
EPA no later than June 30, 2011.
    (ii) Content of request. Requests must contain the following 
information:
    (A) The information outlined in paragraph (o)(2)(ii) of this 
section. For scoping speciations, emission factors, and emission 
characterizations, substitute March 1, 2013 for July 1, 2011 and 
substitute March 1, 2014 for January 1, 2012. For other parameters, 
substitute January 1, 2012 for July 1, 2011 and substitute January 1, 
2013 for January 1, 2012.
    (B) A detailed outline of the unique circumstances necessitating an 
extension, including specific data collection issues that do not meet 
safety regulations, technical infeasibility or specific laws or 
regulations that conflict with data collection. The owner or operator 
must consider all the data collection and emission calculation options 
outlined in the rule for a specific emissions source before claiming 
that a specific safety, technical or legal barrier exists.
    (C) A detailed explanation and supporting documentation of how and 
when the owner or operator will receive the required data and/or 
services to comply with the reporting requirements of this subpart in 
the future.
    (E) The Administrator reserves the right to require that the owner 
or operator provide additional documentation.
    (iii) Reporting of 2011 and subsequent year emissions using scoping 
speciations, emission factors, and emission characterizations developed 
after approval to use best available monitoring methods expires. 
Facilities that are approved to use best available monitoring methods in 
2011 and subsequent years for scoping speciations, emission factors, or 
emission characterizations for certain processes must submit, by March 
31 of the year that begins one year after their approval to use best 
available monitoring method(s) expires, revised emission estimates for 
2011 and subsequent years that reflect the scoping speciations, emission 
factors, and emission characterizations that are measured for those 
processes in 2013 or subsequent years. If the operating scenario for 
2011 or subsequent years is different from all of the operating 
scenarios for which emission factors or emission characterizations are 
developed in 2013 or subsequent years, use Equation L-23 of Sec. 
98.123(c)(3)(viii) to adjust the emission factor(s) or emission 
characterization(s) measured for the new operating scenario(s) to 
account for the differences.
    (5) Approval criteria. To obtain approval, the owner or operator 
must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it is not 
reasonably feasible to acquire, install, or operate the required piece 
of monitoring equipment, to procure measurement services from necessary 
providers, or to gain physical access to make required measurements in a 
facility according to the requirements of this subpart by the dates 
specified in paragraphs (o)(2), (3), and (4) of this section for any of 
the reasons described in paragraph (o)(2)(ii) of this section, or, for 
requests under paragraph (o)(4) of this section, any of the reasons 
described in paragraph (o)(4)(ii)(B) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 98.125  Procedures for estimating missing data.

    (a) A complete record of all measured parameters used in the GHG 
emissions calculations in Sec. 98.123 is required. Therefore, whenever 
a quality-assured value of a required parameter is unavailable, a 
substitute data value for the missing parameter must be used in the 
calculations as specified in the paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. 
You must document and keep records of the procedures used for all such 
estimates.
    (b) For each missing value of the fluorinated GHG concentration or 
fluorine-containing compound concentration, the substitute data value 
must be the arithmetic average of the quality-assured values of that 
parameter immediately preceding and immediately following the missing 
data incident.

[[Page 529]]

    (c) For each missing value of the mass produced, fed into the 
production process, fed into the transformation process, or fed into 
destruction devices, the substitute value of that parameter must be a 
secondary mass measurement where such a measurement is available. For 
example, if the mass produced is usually measured with a flowmeter at 
the inlet to the day tank and that flowmeter fails to meet an accuracy 
or precision test, malfunctions, or is rendered inoperable, then the 
mass produced may be estimated by calculating the change in volume in 
the day tank and multiplying it by the density of the product. Where a 
secondary mass measurement is not available, the substitute value of the 
parameter must be an estimate based on a related parameter. For example, 
if a flowmeter measuring the mass fed into a destruction device is 
rendered inoperable, then the mass fed into the destruction device may 
be estimated using the production rate and the previously observed 
relationship between the production rate and the mass flow rate into the 
destruction device.


<R05>
Sec. 98.126  Data reporting requirements.

    (a) All facilities. In addition to the information required by Sec. 
98.3(c), you must report the information in paragraphs (a)(2) through 
(a)(6) of this section.
    (1) Frequency of reporting under paragraph (a) of this section. The 
information in paragraphs (a)(2), (5), and (6) of this section must be 
reported annually. The information in paragraphs (a)(3) and (4) of this 
section must be reported once by March 31, 2012 for each process and 
operating scenarios that operates between December 31, 2010 and December 
31, 2011. For other processes and operating scenarios, the information 
in paragraphs (a)(3) and (4) of this section must be reported once by

fluorinated gas production process or a fluorinated gas transformation 
process and all such fluorinated gas destruction processes combined.
    (iv) Venting of residual fluorinated GHGs from containers returned

initial scoping speciation of fluorinated GHG at Sec. 98.124(a), by 
process.
    (4) The location and function of the stream(s) (including process 
streams, emissions streams, and destroyed streams) that were analyzed 
under the initial scoping speciation of fluorinated GHG at Sec. 
98.124(a), by process.
    (5) The method used to determine the mass emissions of each 
fluorinated GHG, i.e., mass balance, process-vent-specific emission 
factor, or process-vent-specific emission calculation factor, for each 
process and process vent at the facility. For processes for which the 
process-vent-specific emission factor or process-vent-specific emission 
calculation factor are used, report the method used to estimate 
emissions from equipment leaks.
    (6) The chemical formula and total mass produced of the fluorinated 
gas product in metric tons, by chemical and process.
    (b) Reporting for mass balance approach. For processes whose 
emissions are determined using the mass-balance approach under Sec. 
98.123(b), you must report the information listed in paragraphs (b)(1) 
through (b)(13) of this section for each process on an annual basis. 
Identify and separately report fluorinated GHG emissions from 
transformation processes where the fluorinated GHG reactants are 
produced at another facility. If you use an

[[Page 530]]

element other than fluorine in the mass-balance equation pursuant to 
Sec. 98.123(b)(3), substitute that element for fluorine in the 
reporting requirements of this paragraph.
    (1) If you calculate the relative and absolute errors under 
98.123(b)(1), the absolute and relative errors calculated under 
paragraph Sec. 98.123(b)(1), as well as the data (including quantities 
and their accuracies and precisions) used in these calculations.

emitted from the process in metric tons.
    (6) The mass and chemical formula of each fluorine-containing 
reactant that is fed into the process (metric tons).

of fluorinated gases. The report must include the methods and results of 
any measurement or modeling studies, including the products of 
incomplete combustion for which the exhaust stream was analyzed, as well 
as copies of relevant scientific papers, if available, or citations of 
the papers, if they are not. No new testing is required to fulfill this 
requirement.

Sec. 98.128  Definitions.

    Except as provided in this section, all of the terms used in this 
subpart have the same meaning given in the Clean Air Act and subpart A 
of this part. If a conflict exists between a definition provided in this 
subpart and a definition provided in subpart A, the definition in this 
subpart shall take precedence for the reporting requirements in this 
subpart.

[[Page 534]]

    Batch process or batch operation means a noncontinuous operation 
involving intermittent or discontinuous feed into equipment, and, in 
general, involves the emptying of the equipment after the batch 
operation ceases and prior to beginning a new operation. Addition of raw 
material and withdrawal of product do not occur simultaneously in a 
batch operation.
    Batch emission episode means a discrete venting episode associated 
with a vessel in a process; a vessel may have more than one batch 
emission episode. For example, a displacement of vapor resulting from 
the charging of a vessel with a feed material will result in a discrete 
emission episode that will last through the duration of the charge and 
will have an average flow rate equal to the rate of the charge. If the 
vessel is then heated, there will also be another discrete emission 
episode resulting from the expulsion of expanded vapor. Other emission 
episodes also may occur from the same vessel and other vessels in the 
process, depending on process operations.
    By-product means a chemical that is produced coincidentally during 
the production of another chemical.
    Completely destroyed means destroyed with a destruction efficiency 
of 99.99 percent or greater.
    Completely recaptured means 99.99 percent or greater of each 
fluorinated GHG is removed from a stream.
    Continuous process or operation means a process where the inputs and 
outputs flow continuously throughout the duration of the process. 
Continuous processes are typically steady state.
    Destruction device means any device used to destroy fluorinated GHG.
    Destruction process means a process used to destroy fluorinated GHG 
in a destruction device such as a thermal incinerator or catalytic 
oxidizer.
    Difficult-to-monitor means the equipment piece may not be monitored 
without elevating the monitoring personnel more than 2 meters (7 feet) 
above a support surface or it is not accessible in a safe manner when it 
is in fluorinated GHG service.
    Dual mechanical seal pump and dual mechanical seal agitator means a 
pump or agitator equipped with a dual mechanical seal system that 
includes a barrier fluid system where the barrier fluid is not in light 
liquid service; each barrier fluid system is equipped with a sensor that 
will detect failure of the seal system, the barrier fluid system, or 
both; and meets the following requirements:
    (1) Each dual mechanical seal system is operated with the barrier 
fluid at a pressure that is at all times (except periods of startup, 
shutdown, or malfunction) greater than the pump or agitator stuffing box 
pressure; or
    (2) Equipped with a barrier fluid degassing reservoir that is routed 
to a process or fuel gas system or connected by a closed-vent system to 
a control device; or
    (3) Equipped with a closed-loop system that purges the barrier fluid 
into a process stream.
    Equipment (for the purposes of Sec. 98.123(d) and Sec. 98.124(f) 
only) means each pump, compressor, agitator, pressure relief device, 
sampling connection system, open-ended valve or line, valve, connector, 
and instrumentation system in fluorinated GHG service for a process 
subject to this subpart; and any destruction devices or closed-vent 
systems to which processes subject to this subpart are vented.
    Fluorinated gas means any fluorinated GHG, CFC, or HCFC.
    In fluorinated GHG service means that a piece of equipment either 
contains or contacts a feedstock, by-product, or product that is a 
liquid or gas and contains at least 5 percent by weight fluorinated GHG.
    In gas and vapor service means that a piece of equipment in 
regulated material service contains a gas or vapor at operating 
conditions.
    In heavy liquid service means that a piece of equipment in regulated 
material service is not in gas and vapor service or in light liquid 
service.
    In light liquid service means that a piece of equipment in regulated 
material service contains a liquid that meets the following conditions:
    (1) The vapor pressure of one or more of the compounds is greater 
than 0.3 kilopascals at 20 [deg]C.
    (2) The total concentration of the pure compounds constituents 
having a vapor pressure greater than 0.3

[[Page 535]]

kilopascals at 20 [deg]C is equal to or greater than 20 percent by 
weight of the total process stream.
    (3) The fluid is a liquid at operating conditions.
    Note to definition of ``in light liquid service'': Vapor pressures 
may be determined by standard reference texts or ASTM D-2879, 
(incorporated by reference, see Sec. 98.7).
    In vacuum service means that equipment is operating at an internal 
pressure which is at least 5 kilopascals below ambient pressure.
    Isolated intermediate means a product of a process that is stored 
before subsequent processing. An isolated intermediate is usually a 
product of chemical synthesis. Storage of an isolated intermediate marks 
the end of a process. Storage occurs at any time the intermediate is 
placed in equipment used solely for storage.

or agitator that is designed with no externally actuated shaft 
penetrating the pump or agitator housing.
    Operating scenario means any specific operation of a process and 
includes the information specified in paragraphs (1) through (5) of this 
definition for each process. A change or series of changes to any of 
these elements, except for paragraph (4) of this definition, constitutes 
a different operating scenario.
    (1) A description of the process, the specific process equipment 
used, and the range of operating conditions for the process.
    (2) An identification of related process vents, their associated 
emissions episodes and durations, and calculations and engineering 
analyses to show the annual uncontrolled fluorinated GHG emissions from 
the process vent.
    (3) The control or destruction devices used, as applicable, 
including a description of operating and/or testing conditions for any 
associated destruction device.
    (4) The process vents (including those from other processes) that 
are simultaneously routed to the control or destruction device(s).
    (5) The applicable monitoring requirements and any parametric level 
that assures destruction or removal for all emissions routed to the 
control or destruction device.
    Process means all equipment that collectively functions to produce a 
fluorinated gas product, including an isolated intermediate (which is 
also a fluorinated gas product), or to transform a fluorinated gas 
product. A process may consist of one or more unit operations. For the 
purposes of this subpart, process includes any, all, or a combination of 
reaction, recovery, separation, purification, or other activity, 
operation, manufacture, or treatment which are used to produce a 
fluorinated gas product. For a continuous process, cleaning operations 
conducted may be considered part of the process, at the discretion of 
the facility. For a batch process, cleaning operations are part of the 
process. Ancillary activities are not considered a process or part of 
any process under this subpart. Ancillary activities include boilers and 
incinerators, chillers and refrigeration systems, and other equipment 
and activities that are not directly involved (i.e., they operate within 
a closed system and materials are not combined with process fluids) in 
the processing of raw materials or the manufacturing of a fluorinated 
gas product.
    Process condenser means a condenser whose primary purpose is to 
recover material as an integral part of a process. All condensers 
recovering condensate from a process vent at or above the boiling point 
or all condensers in line prior to a vacuum source are considered 
process condensers. Typically, a primary condenser or condensers in 
series are considered to be integral to the process if they are capable 
of and normally used for the purpose of recovering chemicals for fuel 
value (i.e., net positive heating value), use, reuse or for sale for 
fuel value, use, or reuse.
    Process vent (for the purposes of this subpart only) means a vent 
from a process vessel or vents from multiple process vessels within a 
process that are manifolded together into a common header, through which 
a fluorinated GHG-containing gas stream is, or has the potential to be, 
released to the atmosphere (or the point of entry into a control device, 
if any). Examples of process vents include, but are not limited to, 
vents on condensers

[[Page 536]]

used for product recovery, bottoms receivers, surge control vessels, 
reactors, filters, centrifuges, and process tanks. Process vents do not 
include vents on storage tanks, wastewater emission sources, or pieces 
of equipment.
    Typical batch means a batch process operated within a range of 
operating conditions that are documented in an operating scenario. 
Emissions from a typical batch are based on the operating conditions 
that result in representative emissions. The typical batch defines the 
uncontrolled emissions for each emission episode defined under the 
operating scenario.
    Uncontrolled fluorinated GHG emissions means a gas stream containing 
fluorinated GHG which has exited the process (or process condenser or 
control condenser, where applicable), but which has not yet been 
introduced into a destruction device to reduce the mass of fluorinated 
GHG in the stream. If the emissions from the process are not routed to a 
destruction device, uncontrolled emissions are those fluorinated GHG 
emissions released to the atmosphere.
    Unsafe-to-monitor means that monitoring personnel would be exposed 
to an immediate danger as a consequence of monitoring the piece of 
equipment. Examples of unsafe-to-monitor equipment include, but are not 
limited to, equipment under extreme pressure or heat.

           Subpart O_HCFC	22 Production and HFC	23 Destruction


<R05>
Sec. 98.150  Definition of the source category.

    The HCFC-22 production and HFC-23 destruction source category 
consists of HCFC-22 production processes and HFC-23 destruction 
processes.

[[Page 540]]

    (a) An HCFC-22 production process produces HCFC-22 
(chlorodifluoromethane, or CHClF<INF>2</INF>) from chloroform 
(CHCl<INF>3</INF>) and hydrogen fluoride (HF).
    (b) An HFC-23 destruction process is any process in which HFC-23 
undergoes destruction. An HFC-23 destruction process may or may not be 
co-located with an HCFC-22 production process at the same facility.


<R05>
Sec. 98.151  Reporting threshold.

    You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility 
contains an HCFC-22 production or HFC-23 destruction process and the 
facility meets the requirements of either Sec. 98.2(a)(1) or (a)(2).


<R05>
Sec. 98.152  GHGs to report.

    (a) You must report under subpart C of this part (General Stationary 
Fuel Combustion Sources) the emissions of CO<INF>2</INF>, 
CH<INF>4</INF>, and N<INF>2</INF>O from each stationary combustion unit 
following the requirements of subpart C.
    (b) You must report HFC-23 emissions from HCFC-22 production 
processes and HFC-23 destruction processes.


<R05>
Sec. 98.153  Calculating GHG emissions.

    (a) The mass of HFC-23 generated from each HCFC-22 production 
process shall be estimated by using one of two methods, as applicable:
    (1) Where the mass flow of the combined stream of HFC-23 and another 
reaction product (e.g., HCl) is measured, multiply the weekly (or more 
frequent) HFC-23 concentration measurement (which may be the average of 
more frequent concentration measurements) by the weekly (or more 
frequent) mass flow of the combined stream of HFC-23 and the other 
product. To estimate annual HFC-23 production, sum the weekly (or more 
frequent) estimates of the quantities of HFC-23 produced over the year. 
This calculation is summarized in Equation O-1 of this section:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR30OC09.051

Where:

G<INF>23</INF> = Mass of HFC-23 generated annually (metric tons).
c<INF>23</INF> = Fraction HFC-23 by weight in HFC-23/other product

period p (kg).
p = Period over which mass flows and concentrations are measured.
n = Number of concentration and flow measurement periods for the year.
10<SUP>-3</SUP> = Conversion factor from kilograms to metric tons.

    (2) Where the mass of only a reaction product other than HFC-23 
(either HCFC-22 or HCl) is measured, multiply the ratio of the weekly 
(or more frequent) measurement of the HFC-23 concentration and the 
weekly (or more frequent) measurement of the other product concentration 
by the weekly (or more frequent) mass produced of the other product. To 
estimate annual HFC-23 production, sum the weekly (or more frequent) 
estimates of the quantities of HFC-23 produced over the year. This 
calculation is summarized in Equation O-2 of this section, assuming that 
the other product is HCFC-22. If the other product is HCl, HCl may be 
substituted for HCFC-22 in Equations O-2 and O-3 of this section.

process upstream of the output measurement over the period p (kg).
LF = Factor to account for the loss of HCFC-22 upstream of the 
measurement. The value for LF shall be determined pursuant to Sec. 
98.154(e).

    (c) For HCFC-22 production facilities that do not use a thermal 
oxidizer or that have a thermal oxidizer that is not directly connected 
to the HCFC-22 production equipment, HFC-23 emissions shall be estimated

Sec. 98.154  Monitoring and QA/QC requirements.

    These requirements apply to measurements that are reported under 
this subpart or that are used to estimate reported quantities pursuant 
to Sec. 98.153.
    (a) The concentrations (fractions by weight) of HFC-23 and HCFC-22

process upstream of the output measurement in paragraph (c) of this 
section shall be measured (when being added) using flowmeters, weigh 
scales, or a combination of volumetric and density measurements with an 
accuracy and precision of 1.0 percent of full scale or better. If the 
mass in paragraph (c) of this section is measured by weighing containers 
that include returned heels as well as newly produced fluorinated GHGs, 
the returned heels shall be considered used fluorinated HCFC-22 for 
purposes of this paragraph (d) of this section and Sec. 98.153(b).
    (e) The loss factor LF in Equation O-3 of this subpart for the mass 
of HCFC-22 produced shall have the value 1.015 or another value that can 
be demonstrated, to the satisfaction of the Administrator, to account 
for losses of HCFC-22 between the reactor and the point of measurement

    (f) The mass of HFC-23 sent off site for sale shall be measured at 
least weekly (when being packaged) using flowmeters, weigh scales, or a 
combination of volumetric and density measurements with an accuracy and 
precision of 1.0 percent of full scale or better.
    (g) The mass of HFC-23 sent off site for destruction shall be

[[Page 543]]

least weekly (when being packaged) using flowmeters, weigh scales, or a 
combination of volumetric and density measurements with an accuracy and

includes more than trace concentrations of materials other than HFC-23, 
the concentration of the fluorinated GHG shall be measured at least 
weekly using equipment and methods (e.g., gas chromatography) with an 
accuracy and precision of 5 percent or better at the concentrations of 
the process samples. This concentration (mass fraction) shall be

1.0 percent of full scale or better.
    (i) The number of sources of equipment type t with screening values 
greater than or equal to 10,000 ppmv shall be determined using EPA 
Method 21 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, and defining a leak as 
follows:
    (1) A leak source that could emit HFC-23, and
    (2) A leak source at whose surface a concentration of fluorocarbons 
equal to or greater than 10,000 ppm is measured.
    (j) The number of sources of equipment type t with screening values 
less than 10,000 ppmv shall be the difference between the number of leak 
sources of equipment type t that could emit HFC-23 and the number of 
sources of equipment type t with screening values greater than or equal 
to 10,000 ppmv as determined under paragraph (h) of this section.
    (k) The mass of HFC-23 emitted from process vents shall be estimated 
at least monthly by incorporating the results of the most recent 
emissions test into Equation O-7 of this subpart. HCFC-22 production 
facilities that use a destruction device connected to the HCFC-22 
production equipment shall conduct emissions tests at process vents at 
least once every five years or after significant changes to the process. 
Emissions tests shall be conducted in accordance with EPA Method 18 at 
40 CFR part 60, appendix A-6, under conditions that are typical for the 
production process at the facility. The sensitivity of the tests shall 
be sufficient to detect an emission rate that would result in annual 
emissions of 200 kg of HFC-23 if sustained over one year.
    (l) For purposes of Equation O-9 of this subpart, the destruction 
efficiency must be equated to the destruction efficiency determined 
during a new or previous performance test of the destruction device. 
HFC-23 destruction facilities shall conduct annual measurements of HFC-
23 concentrations at the outlet of the destruction device in accordance 
with EPA Method 18 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-6. Three samples shall 
be taken under conditions that are typical for the production process 
and destruction device at the facility, and the average concentration of 
HFC-23 shall be determined. The sensitivity of the concentration 
measurement shall be sufficient to detect an outlet concentration equal 
to or less than the outlet concentration determined in the destruction 
efficiency performance test. If the concentration measurement indicates 
that the HFC-23 concentration is less than or equal to that measured 
during the performance test that is the basis for the destruction 
efficiency, continue to use the previously determined destruction 
efficiency. If the concentration measurement indicates that the HFC-23 
concentration is greater than that measured during the performance test 
that is the basis for the destruction efficiency, facilities shall 
either:
    (1) Substitute the higher HFC-23 concentration for that measured 
during the destruction efficiency performance test and calculate a new 
destruction efficiency, or
    (2) Estimate the mass emissions of HFC-23 from the destruction 
device based on the measured HFC-23 concentration and volumetric flow 
rate determined by measurement of volumetric flow rate using EPA Method 
2, 2A, 2C,2D, or 2F at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-1, or Method 26 at 40 
CFR part 60, appendix A-2. Determine the mass rate of HFC-23 into the 
destruction device by measuring the HFC-23

[[Page 544]]

concentration and volumetric flow rate at the inlet or by a metering 
device for HFC-23 sent to the device. Determine a new destruction 
efficiency based on the mass flow rate of HFC-23 into and out of the 
destruction device.
    (m) HCFC-22 production facilities shall account for HFC-23 
generation and emissions that occur as a result of startups, shutdowns, 
and malfunctions, either recording HFC-23 generation and emissions 
during these events, or documenting that these events do not result in 
significant HFC-23 generation and/or emissions.
    (n) The mass of HFC-23 fed into the destruction device shall be 
measured at least weekly using flow meters, weigh scales, or a 
combination of volumetric and density measurements with an accuracy and 
precision of 1.0 percent of full scale or better. If the measured mass 
includes more than trace concentrations of materials other than HFC-23, 
the concentrations of the HFC-23 shall be measured at least weekly using 
equipment and methods (e.g., gas chromatography) with an accuracy and 
precision of 5 percent or better at the concentrations of the process 
samples. This concentration (mass fraction) shall be multiplied by the 
mass measurement to obtain the mass of the HFC-23 destroyed.
    (o) In their estimates of the mass of HFC-23 destroyed, HFC-23 
destruction facilities shall account for any temporary reductions in the 
destruction efficiency that result from any startups, shutdowns, or 
malfunctions of the destruction device, including departures from the 
operating conditions defined in State or local permitting requirements

Sec. 98.155  Procedures for estimating missing data.

    (a) A complete record of all measured parameters used in the GHG 
emissions calculations is required. Therefore, whenever a quality-
assured value of a required parameter is unavailable (e.g., if a meter 
malfunctions during unit operation or if a required process sample is 
not taken), a substitute data value for the missing parameter shall be 
used in the calculations, according to the following requirements:
    (1) For each missing value of the HFC-23 or HCFC-22 concentration, 
the substitute data value shall be the arithmetic average of the 
quality-assured values of that parameter immediately preceding and 
immediately following the missing data incident. If, for a particular 
parameter, no quality-assured data are available prior to the missing 
data incident, the substitute data value shall be the first quality-
assured value obtained after the missing data period.
    (2) For each missing value of the product stream mass flow or 
product mass, the substitute value of that parameter shall be a 
secondary product measurement where such a measurement is available. If 
that measurement is taken significantly downstream of the usual mass 
flow or mass measurement (e.g., at the shipping dock rather than near 
the reactor), the measurement shall be multiplied by 1.015 to compensate 
for losses. Where a secondary mass measurement is not available, the 
substitute value of the parameter shall be an estimate based on a 
related parameter. For example, if a flowmeter measuring the mass fed 
into a destruction device is rendered inoperable, then the mass fed into 
the destruction device may be estimated

[[Page 545]]

using the production rate and the previously observed relationship 
between the production rate and the mass flow rate into the destruction 
device.


<R05>
Sec. 98.156  Data reporting requirements.

    (a) In addition to the information required by Sec. 98.3(c), the 
HCFC-22 production facility shall report the following information at 
the facility level:
    (1) Annual mass of HCFC-22 produced in metric tons.
    (2) Loss Factor used to account for the loss of HCFC- 22 upstream of 
the measurement.
    (3) Annual mass of reactants fed into the process in metric tons of

HFC-23 (i.e., unreacted reactants, HCl and other by-products) that occur 
in more than trace concentrations and that are permanently removed from 
the process.
    (5) The method for tracking startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions 
and HFC-23 generation/emissions during these events.

    (8) Annual mass of any HFC-23 sent off site for sale in metric tons.
    (9) Annual mass of any HFC-23 sent off site for destruction in 
metric tons.

in metric tons.
    (11) Annual mass of HFC-23 emitted in metric tons.
    (12) Annual mass of HFC-23 emitted from equipment leaks in metric 
tons.
    (13) Annual mass of HFC-23 emitted from process vents in metric 
tons.

23 destruction process:
    (1) Annual mass of HFC-23 fed into the destruction device.
    (2) Annual mass of HFC-23 destroyed.
    (3) Annual mass of HFC-23 emitted from the destruction device.

(mass fraction) of HFC-23 measured at the outlet of the destruction 
device during the facility's annual HFC-23 concentration measurements at 
the outlet of the device.
    (d) If the HFC-23 concentration measured pursuant to Sec. 98.154(l) 
is greater than that measured during the performance test that is the 
basis for the destruction efficiency (DE), the facility shall report the 
revised destruction efficiency calculated under Sec. 98.154(l) and the 
values used to calculate it, specifying whether Sec. 98.154(l)(1) or 
Sec. 98.154(l)(2) has been used for the calculation. Specifically, the 
facility shall report the following:
    (1) Flow rate of HFC-23 being fed into the destruction device in kg/
hr.
    (2) Concentration (mass fraction) of HFC-23 at the outlet of the 
destruction device.
    (3) Flow rate at the outlet of the destruction device in kg/hr.

changes must be reflected in a revision to this report. The revised 
report must be submitted to EPA within 60 days of the change.

Sec. 98.164  Monitoring and QA/QC requirements.

    The GHG emissions data for hydrogen production process units must be 
quality-assured as specified in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section, 
as appropriate for each process unit:
    (a) If a CEMS is used to measure GHG emissions, then the facility 
must comply with the monitoring and QA/QC procedures specified in Sec. 
98.34(c).
    (b) If a CEMS is not used to measure GHG emissions, then you must:
    (1) Calibrate all oil and gas flow meters that are used to measure 
liquid and gaseous feedstock volumes (except for gas billing meters) 
according to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements for the Tier 3 
methodology in Sec. 98.34(b)(1). Perform oil tank drop measurements (if 
used to quantify liquid fuel or feedstock consumption) according to 
Sec. 98.34(b)(2). Calibrate all solids weighing equipment according to 
the procedures in Sec. 98.3(i).
    (2) Determine the carbon content and the molecular weight annually 
of standard gaseous hydrocarbon fuels and feedstocks having consistent 
composition (e.g., natural gas). For other gaseous fuels and feedstocks 
(e.g., biogas, refinery gas, or process gas), sample and analyze no less 
frequently than weekly to determine the carbon content and molecular 
weight of the fuel and feedstock.
    (3) Determine the carbon content of fuel oil, naphtha, and other 
liquid fuels and feedstocks at least monthly, except annually for 
standard liquid hydrocarbon fuels and feedstocks having consistent 
composition, or upon delivery for liquid fuels delivered by bulk 
transport (e.g., by truck or rail).
    (4) Determine the carbon content of coal, coke, and other solid 
fuels and feedstocks at least monthly, except annually for standard 
solid hydrocarbon fuels and feedstocks having consistent composition, or 
upon delivery for solid fuels delivered by bulk transport (e.g., by 
truck or rail).
    (5) You must use the following applicable methods to determine the 
carbon content for all fuels and feedstocks, and molecular weight of 
gaseous fuels and feedstocks. Alternatively, you may use the results of 
continuous chromatographic analysis of the fuel and feedstock, provided 
that the gas chromatograph (GC) is operated, maintained, and calibrated 
according to the manufacturer's instructions; and the methods used for 
operation, maintenance, and calibration of the GC are documented in the 
written monitoring plan for the unit under Sec. 98.3(g)(5).

Sec. 98.165  Procedures for estimating missing data.

    A complete record of all measured parameters used in the GHG 
emissions calculations is required. Therefore, whenever a quality-
assured value of a required parameter is unavailable (e.g., if a meter 
malfunctions during unit operation), a substitute data value for the 
missing parameter must be used in the calculations as specified in 
paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section:
    (a) For each missing value of the monthly fuel and feedstock 
consumption, the substitute data value must be the best available 
estimate of the fuel and feedstock consumption, based on all available 
process data (e.g., hydrogen production, electrical load, and operating 
hours). You must document and keep records of the procedures used for 
all such estimates.
    (b) For each missing value of the carbon content or molecular weight 
of the fuel and feedstock, the substitute data value must be the 
arithmetic average of the quality-assured values of carbon contents or 
molecular weight of the fuel and feedstock immediately preceding and 
immediately following the missing data incident. If no quality-assured 
data on carbon contents or molecular weight of the fuel and feedstock 
are available prior to the missing data incident, the substitute data 
value must be the first quality-assured value for carbon contents or 
molecular weight of the fuel and feedstock obtained after the missing 
data period. You must document and keep records of the procedures used 
for all such estimates.
    (c) For missing CEMS data, you must use the missing data procedures 
in Sec. 98.35.

you must report the following information for each hydrogen production 
process unit:
    (1) Unit identification number and annual CO<INF>2</INF> emissions.
    (2) Monthly consumption of each fuel and feedstock used for hydrogen 
production and its type (scf of gaseous fuels and feedstocks, gallons of 
liquid fuels and feedstocks, kg of solid fuels and feedstocks).
    (3) Annual quantity of hydrogen produced (metric tons).
    (4) Annual quantity of ammonia produced, if applicable (metric 
tons).
    (5) Monthly analyses of carbon content for each fuel and feedstock 
used in hydrogen production (kg carbon/kg of gaseous and solid fuels and

    (vi) For each process input that is a fuel, determine the carbon 
content and molecular weight (if applicable) using the applicable 
methods listed in Sec. 98.34.

used. Examples of these different ferrous materials include carbon 
steel, low carbon steel, stainless steel, high alloy steel, pig iron, 
iron scrap, and direct reduced iron.

representative performance (i.e., performance based on normal operating 
conditions) of the affected process.
    (2)For the furnace exhaust from basic oxygen furnaces, EAFs, 
decarburization vessels, and direct reduction furnaces, sample the 
furnace exhaust for at least three complete production cycles that start

or specialty (low carbon) steel, develop an emission factor for the 
production of both types of steel.
    (3) For taconite indurating furnaces, non-recovery coke batteries, 
and sinter processes, sample for at least 3 hours.
    (4) Conduct the stack test using EPA Method 3A at 40 CFR part 60,

(as applicable) during the test using the same plant instruments or 
procedures that are used for accounting purposes (such as weigh hoppers, 
belt weigh feeders, combination of bulk density and volume measurements, 
etc.)
    (6) If your process operates under different conditions as part of 
normal operations in such a manner that CO<INF>2</INF> emissions change 
by more than 20 percent (e.g., routine changes in the carbon content of 
the sinter feed or change in grade of product), you must perform 
emission testing and develop separate emission factors for these 
different operating conditions and determine emissions based on the 
number of hours the process operates and the production or feed rate (as 
applicable) at each specific different condition.
    (7) If your EAF and decarburization vessel exhaust to a common 
emission control device and stack, you must sample each process in the 
ducts before the emissions are combined, sample each process when only 
one process is operating, or sample the combined emissions when both 
processes are operating and base the site-specific emission factor on 
the steel production rate of the EAF.
    (8) The results of a performance test must include the analysis of 
samples, determination of emissions, and raw data. The performance test 
report must contain all information and data used to derive the emission 
factor.
    (d) For a coke pushing process, determine the metric tons of coal 
charged to the coke ovens and record the totals

[[Page 558]]

for each pushing process for each calendar month. Coal charged to coke 
ovens can be measured using weigh belts or a combination of measuring 
volume and bulk density.

    A complete record of all measured parameters used in the GHG 
emissions calculations in Sec. 98.173 is required. Therefore, whenever 
a quality-assured value of a required parameter is unavailable, a 
substitute data value for the missing parameter shall be used in the 
calculations as specified in the paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. 
You must follow the missing data procedures in Sec. 98.255(b) of 
subpart Y (Petroleum Refineries) of this part for flares burning coke 
oven gas or blast furnace gas. You must document and keep records of the 
procedures used for all such estimates.
    (a) For each missing data for the carbon content of inputs and 
outputs for facilities that estimate emissions using the carbon mass 
balance procedure in Sec. 98.173(b)(1) or for facilities that estimate 
emissions using the site-specific emission factor procedure in Sec. 
98.173(b)(2); 100 percent data availability is required. You must repeat 
the test for average carbon contents of inputs and outputs according to 
the procedures in Sec. 98.174(b)(2). Similarly, you must repeat the 
test to determine the site-specific emission factor if data on the 
CO<INF>2</INF> emission rate, process production rate or process feed 
rate are missing.
    (b) For missing records of the monthly mass or volume of carbon-
containing inputs and outputs using the carbon mass balance procedure in 
Sec. 98.173(b)(1), the substitute data value must be based on the best 
available estimate of the mass of the input or output material from all 
available process data or data used for accounting purposes.

Sec. 98.203  Calculating GHG emissions.

    (a) Calculate the mass of each GHG emitted from magnesium production 
or processing over the calendar year using either Equation T-1 or 
Equation T-2 of this section, as appropriate. Both of these equations 
equate emissions of cover gases or carrier gases to consumption of cover

    (1) To estimate emissions of cover gases or carrier gases by 
monitoring changes in container masses and inventories, emissions of 
each cover gas or carrier gas shall be estimated using Equation T-1 of 
this section:

Where:

E<INF>X</INF> = Emissions of each cover gas or carrier gas, X, in metric 
tons over the reporting year.
I<INF>B,x</INF> = Inventory of each cover gas or carrier gas stored in 
cylinders or other containers at the beginning of the year, including 
heels, in kg.
I<INF>E,x</INF> = Inventory of each cover gas or carrier gas stored in 
cylinders or other containers at the end of the year, including heels, 
in kg.

    (2) To estimate emissions of cover gases or carrier gases by 
monitoring changes in the masses of individual containers as their 
contents are used, emissions of each cover gas or carrier gas shall be 
estimated using Equation T-2 of this section:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR12JY10.001

Where:

E<INF>GHG</INF> = Emissions of each cover gas or carrier gas, X, over 
the reporting year (metric tons).

estimated by using Equation T-3 of this section:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR12JY10.002

Where:

Q<INF>p</INF> = The mass of the cover or carrier gas consumed (kg) over 
the container-use period p (e.g., one month).
M<INF>B</INF> = The mass of the container's contents (kg) at the 
beginning of period p.

mass of each cover or carrier gas monitored may be used as the mass of 
cover or carrier gas consumed (Q<INF>p</INF>), in kg for period p in 
Equation T-2 of this section.

contain the information in Sec. 98.3(d)(2)(ii). To obtain approval, the 
request must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it is 
not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required 
piece of monitoring equipment by January 1, 2011. The use of best 
available monitoring methods will not be approved beyond December 31, 
2011.
    (b) Emissions (consumption) of cover gases and carrier gases may be 
estimated by monitoring the changes in container weights and inventories 
using Equation T-1 of this subpart, by monitoring the changes in 
individual container weights as the contents of each container are used 
using Equations T-2 and T-3 of this subpart, or by monitoring the mass 
flow of the pure cover gas or carrier gas into the gas distribution 
system. Emissions must be estimated at least annually.
    (c) When estimating emissions by monitoring the mass flow of the 
pure cover gas or carrier gas into the gas distribution system, you must 
use gas flow meters, or mass flow controllers, with an accuracy of 1 
percent of full scale or better.
    (d) When estimating emissions using Equation T-1 of this subpart, 
you must ensure that all the quantities required by Equation T-1 of this 
subpart have been measured using scales or load cells with an accuracy 
of 1 percent of full scale or better, accounting for the tare weights of 
the containers. You may accept gas masses or weights provided by the gas 
supplier e.g., for the contents of containers containing new gas or for 
the heels remaining in containers returned to the gas supplier) if the 
supplier provides documentation verifying that accuracy standards are 
met; however you remain responsible for the accuracy of these masses or 
weights under this subpart.
    (e) When estimating emissions using Equations T-2 and T-3 of this 
subpart, you must monitor and record container identities and masses as 
follows:
    (1) Track the identities and masses of containers leaving and 
entering storage with check-out and check-in sheets and procedures. The 
masses of cylinders returning to storage shall be measured immediately 
before the cylinders are put back into storage.
    (2) Ensure that all the quantities required by Equations T-2 and T-3 
of this subpart have been measured using scales or load cells with an 
accuracy of 1 percent of full scale or better, accounting for the tare 
weights of the containers. You may accept gas masses or weights provided 
by the gas supplier e.g., for the contents of cylinders containing new 
gas or for the heels remaining in cylinders returned to the gas 
supplier) if the supplier provides documentation verifying that accuracy 
standards are met; however, you remain responsible for the accuracy of 
these masses or weights under this subpart.
    (f) All flowmeters, scales, and load cells used to measure 
quantities that are to be reported under this subpart shall be 
calibrated using calibration procedures specified by the flowmeter, 
scale, or load cell manufacturer. Calibration shall be performed prior 
to the first reporting year. After the initial calibration, 
recalibration shall be performed at the minimum frequency specified by 
the manufacturer.

Sec. 98.205  Procedures for estimating missing data.

    (a) A complete record of all measured parameters used in the GHG 
emission calculations is required. Therefore, whenever a quality-assured 
value of a required parameter is unavailable, a substitute data value 
for the missing parameter will be used in the calculations as specified 
in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) Replace missing data on the emissions of cover or carrier gases 
by multiplying magnesium production during the missing data period by 
the average cover or carrier gas usage rate from the most recent period 
when operating conditions were similar to those for the period for which 
the data are missing. Calculate the usage rate for each cover

<R05>
Sec. 98.230  Definition of the source category.

    (a) This source category consists of the following industry 
segments:
    (1) Offshore petroleum and natural gas production. Offshore 
petroleum and natural gas production is any platform structure, affixed 
temporarily or permanently to offshore submerged lands, that houses 
equipment to extract hydrocarbons from the ocean or lake floor and that 
processes and/or transfers such hydrocarbons to storage, transport 
vessels, or onshore. In addition, offshore production includes secondary 
platform structures connected to the platform structure via walkways, 
storage tanks associated with the platform structure and floating 
production and storage offloading equipment (FPSO). This source category 
does not include reporting of emissions from offshore drilling and 
exploration that is not conducted on production platforms.
    (2) Onshore petroleum and natural gas production. Onshore petroleum 
and natural gas production means all equipment on a well pad or 
associated with

[[Page 579]]

a well pad (including compressors, generators, or storage facilities), 
and portable non-self-propelled equipment on a well pad or associated 
with a well pad (including well drilling and completion equipment, 
workover equipment, gravity separation equipment, auxiliary non-
transportation-related equipment, and leased, rented or contracted 
equipment) used in the production, extraction, recovery, lifting, 
stabilization, separation or treating of petroleum and/or natural gas 
(including condensate). This equipment also includes associated storage 
or measurement vessels and all enhanced oil recovery (EOR) operations 
using CO<INF>2</INF>, and all petroleum and natural gas production 
located on islands, artificial islands, or structures connected by a 
causeway to land, an island, or artificial island.
    (3) Onshore natural gas processing. Natural gas processing separates 
and recovers natural gas liquids (NGLs) and/or other non-methane gases 
and liquids from a stream of produced natural gas using equipment 
performing one or more of the following processes: oil and condensate 
removal, water removal, separation of natural gas liquids, sulfur and 
carbon dioxide removal, fractionation of NGLs, or other processes, and 
also the capture of CO<INF>2</INF> separated from natural gas streams. 
This segment also includes all residue gas compression equipment owned 
or operated by the natural gas processing facility, whether inside or 
outside the processing facility fence. This source category does not 
include reporting of emissions from gathering lines and boosting 
stations. This source category includes:
    (i) All processing facilities that fractionate.
    (ii) All processing facilities that do not fractionate with 
throughput of 25 MMscf per day or greater.
    (4) Onshore natural gas transmission compression. Onshore natural 
gas transmission compression means any stationary combination of 
compressors that move natural gas at elevated pressure from production 
fields or natural gas processing facilities in transmission pipelines to 
natural gas distribution pipelines or into storage. In addition, 
transmission compressor station may include equipment for liquids 
separation, natural gas dehydration, and tanks for the storage of water 
and hydrocarbon liquids. Residue (sales) gas compression operated by 
natural gas processing facilities are included in the onshore natural 
gas processing segment and are excluded from this segment. This source 
category also does not include reporting of emissions from gathering 
lines and boosting stations--these sources are currently not covered by 
subpart W.
    (5) Underground natural gas storage. Underground natural gas storage 
means subsurface storage, including depleted gas or oil reservoirs and 
salt dome caverns that store natural gas that has been transferred from 
its original location for the primary purpose of load balancing (the 
process of equalizing the receipt and delivery of natural gas); natural 
gas underground storage processes and operations (including compression, 
dehydration and flow measurement, and excluding transmission pipelines); 
and all the wellheads connected to the compression units located at the 
facility that inject and recover natural gas into and from the 
underground reservoirs.
    (6) Liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage. LNG storage means onshore 
LNG storage vessels located above ground, equipment for liquefying 
natural gas, compressors to capture and re-liquefy boil-off-gas, re-
condensers, and vaporization units for re-gasification of the liquefied 
natural gas.
    (7) LNG import and export equipment. LNG import equipment means all 
onshore or offshore equipment that receives imported LNG via ocean 
transport, stores LNG, re-gasifies LNG, and delivers re-gasified natural 
gas to a natural gas transmission or distribution system. LNG export 
equipment means all onshore or offshore equipment that receives natural 
gas, liquefies natural gas, stores LNG, and transfers the LNG via ocean 
transportation to any location, including locations in the United 
States.
    (8) Natural gas distribution. Natural gas distribution means the 
distribution pipelines (not interstate transmission pipelines or 
intrastate transmission pipelines) and metering and regulating equipment 
at city gate stations, and

[[Page 580]]

excluding customer meters, that physically deliver natural gas to end 
users and is operated by a Local Distribution Company (LDC) that is 
regulated as a separate operating company by a public utility commission 
or that is operated as an independent municipally-owned distribution 
system. This segment excludes customer meters and infrastructure and 
pipelines (both interstate and intrastate) delivering natural gas 
directly to major industrial users and ``farm taps'' upstream of the 
local distribution company inlet.
    (b) [Reserved]

that measures CO<INF>2</INF> emissions according to subpart C of this 
part, you must calculate CO<INF>2</INF> emissions under this subpart by 
following the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology and all associated 
requirements for Tier 4 in subpart C of this part (General Stationary 
Fuel Combustion Sources). If CEMS and/or volumetric flow rate monitor 
are not available, you may install a CEMS that complies with the Tier 4 
Calculation Methodology in subpart C of this part (General Stationary

    (n) Flare stack emissions. Calculate CO<INF>2</INF>, CH<INF>4</INF>, 
and N<INF>2</INF>O emissions from a flare stack as follows:
    (1) If you have a continuous flow measurement device on the flare, 
you must use the measured flow volumes to calculate the flare gas 
emissions. If all of the flare gas is not measured by the existing flow 
measurement device, then the flow not measured can be estimated using 
engineering calculations based on best available data or company 
records. If you do not have a continuous flow measurement device on the 
flare, you can install a flow measuring device on the flare or use 
engineering calculations based on process knowledge, company records, 
and best available data.
    (2) If you have a continuous gas composition analyzer on gas to the 
flare, you must use these compositions in calculating emissions. If you 
do not have a continuous gas composition analyzer on gas to the flare, 
you must use the appropriate gas compositions for each stream of 
hydrocarbons going to the flare as follows:
    (i) For onshore natural gas production, determine natural gas 
composition using (u)(2)(i) of this section.
    (ii) For onshore natural gas processing, when the stream going to 
flare is natural gas, use the GHG mole percent in feed natural gas for 
all streams upstream of the de-methanizer or dew point control, and GHG 
mole percent in facility specific residue gas to transmission pipeline 
systems for all emissions sources downstream of the de-methanizer 
overhead or dew point control for onshore natural gas processing 
facilities.
    (iii) When the stream going to the flare is a hydrocarbon product 
stream, such as ethane, propane, butane, pentane-plus and mixed light 
hydrocarbons, then use a representative composition from the source for 
the stream determined by engineering calculation based on process 
knowledge and best available data.
    (3) Determine flare combustion efficiency from manufacturer. If not 
available, assume that flare combustion efficiency is 98 percent.
    (4) Calculate GHG volumetric emissions at actual conditions using

open ended vents, you can use one of the following methods: Calibrated 
bagging or high volume sampler according to methods set forth in Sec.

this section to monitor inaccessible equipment leaks or vented 
emissions.
    (3) Infrared laser beam illuminated instrument. Use an infrared 
laser beam illuminated instrument for equipment leak detection. Any 
emissions detected by the infrared laser beam illuminated instrument is 
a leak unless screened with Method 21 monitoring, in which case 10,000 
ppm or greater is designated a leak. In addition, you must operate the 
infrared laser beam illuminated instrument to detect the source types 
required by this subpart in accordance with the instrument 
manufacturer's operating parameters.
    (4) Optical gas imaging instrument. An optical gas imaging 
instrument must be used for all source types that are inaccessible and 
cannot be monitored without elevating the monitoring personnel more than 
2 meters above a support surface.
    (5) Acoustic leak detection device. Use the acoustic leak detection 
device to detect through-valve leakage. When using the acoustic leak 
detection device to quantify the through-valve leakage, you must use the 
instrument manufacturer's calculation methods to quantify the through-
valve leak. When using the acoustic leak detection device, if a leak of 
3.1 scf per hour or greater is calculated, a leak is detected. In 
addition, you must operate the acoustic leak detection device to monitor 
the source valves required by this subpart in accordance with the 
instrument manufacturer's operating parameters.
    (b) You must operate and calibrate all flow meters, composition 
analyzers and pressure gauges used to measure quantities reported in 
Sec. 98.233 according to the procedures in Sec. 98.3(i) and the 
procedures in paragraph (b) of this section. You may use an appropriate 
standard method published by a consensus-based standards organization if 
such a method exists or you may use an industry standard practice. 
Consensus-based standards organizations

include, but are not limited to, the following: ASTM International, the 
American National Standards Institute (ANSI), the American Gas 
Association (AGA), the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), 
the American Petroleum Institute (API), and the North American Energy 
Standards Board (NAESB).
    (c) Use calibrated bags (also known as vent bags) only where the 
emissions are at near-atmospheric pressures such that it is safe to 
handle and can capture all the emissions, below the maximum temperature 
specified by the vent bag manufacturer, and the entire emissions volume 
can be encompassed for measurement.
    (1) Hold the bag in place enclosing the emissions source to capture 
the entire emissions and record the time required for completely filling 
the bag. If the bag inflates in less than one second, assume one second 
inflation time.
    (2) Perform three measurements of the time required to fill the bag, 
report the emissions as the average of the three readings.
    (3) Estimate natural gas volumetric emissions at standard conditions 
using calculations in Sec. 98.233(t).
    (4) Estimate CH<INF>4</INF> and CO<INF>2</INF> volumetric and mass 
emissions from volumetric natural gas emissions using the calculations 
in Sec. 98.233(u) and (v).
    (d) Use a high volume sampler to measure emissions within the 
capacity of the instrument.
    (1) A technician following manufacturer instructions shall conduct 
measurements, including equipment manufacturer operating procedures and 
measurement methodologies relevant to using a high volume sampler, 
including positioning the instrument for complete capture of the 
equipment leak without creating backpressure on the source.
    (2) If the high volume sampler, along with all attachments available 
from the manufacturer, is not able to capture all the emissions from the 
source then use anti-static wraps or other aids to capture all emissions 
without violating operating requirements as provided in the instrument 
manufacturer's manual.
    (3) Estimate CH<INF>4</INF> and CO<INF>2</INF> volumetric and mass 
emissions from volumetric natural gas emissions using the calculations 
in Sec. 98.233(u) and (v).
    (4) Calibrate the instrument at 2.5 percent methane with 97.5 
percent air and 100 percent CH<INF>4</INF> by using calibrated gas 
samples and by following manufacturer's instructions for calibration.

Sec. 98.235  Procedures for estimating missing data.

    A complete record of all estimated and/or measured parameters used 
in the GHG emissions calculations is required. If data are lost or an 
error occurs during annual emissions estimation or measurements, you 
must repeat the estimation or measurement activity for those sources as 
soon as possible, including in the subsequent calendar year if missing 
data are not discovered until after December 31 of the year in which 
data are collected, until valid data for reporting is obtained. Data 
developed and/or collected in a subsequent calendar year to substitute 
for missing data cannot be used for that subsequent year's emissions 
estimation. Where missing data procedures are used for the previous 
year, at least 30 days must separate emissions estimation or 
measurements for the previous year and emissions estimation or 
measurements for the current year of data collection. For missing data 
which are continuously monitored or measured, (for example flow meters), 
or for missing temperature or pressure data that are required under 
Sec. 98.236, the reporter may use best available

[[Page 612]]

data for use in emissions determinations. The reporter must record and 
report the basis for the best available data in these cases.

CH<INF>4</INF> or CO<INF>2</INF> containing natural gas or hydrocarbon 
gas (not including stationary combustion flue gas), including process 
designed flow to the atmosphere through seals or vent pipes, equipment

                   Subpart X_Petrochemical Production


<R05>
Sec. 98.240  Definition of the source category.

    (a) The petrochemical production source category consists of all 
processes that produce acrylonitrile, carbon black, ethylene, ethylene 
dichloride, ethylene oxide, or methanol, except as specified in 
paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section. The source category includes 
processes that produce the petrochemical as an intermediate in the on-
site production of other chemicals as well as processes that produce the 
petrochemical as an end product for sale or shipment off site.
    (b) A process that produces a petrochemical as a byproduct is not 
part of the petrochemical production source category.
    (c) A facility that makes methanol, hydrogen, and/or ammonia from 
synthesis gas is part of the petrochemical source category if the annual 
mass of methanol produced exceeds the individual annual mass production 
levels of both hydrogen recovered as product and ammonia. The facility 
is part of subpart P of this part (Hydrogen Production) if the annual 
mass of hydrogen recovered as product exceeds the individual annual mass 
production levels of both methanol and ammonia. The facility is part of 
subpart G of this part (Ammonia Manufacturing) if the annual mass of 
ammonia produced exceeds the individual annual mass production levels of 
both hydrogen recovered as product and methanol.
    (d) A direct chlorination process that is operated independently of 
an oxychlorination process to produce ethylene dichloride is not part of 
the petrochemical production source category.
    (e) A process that produces bone black is not part of the 
petrochemical source category.
    (f) A process that produces a petrochemical from bio-based feedstock 
is not part of the petrochemical production source category.
    (g) A process that solely distills or recycles waste solvent that 
contains a

Sec. 98.241  Reporting threshold.

    You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility 
contains a petrochemical process as specified in Sec. 98.240, and the 
facility meets the requirements of either Sec. 98.2(a)(1) or (2).


<R05>
Sec. 98.242  GHGs to report.

    You must report the information in paragraphs (a) through (c) of 
this section:
    (a) CO<INF>2</INF> CH<INF>4</INF>, and N<INF>2</INF>O process 
emissions from each petrochemical process unit. Process emissions 
include CO<INF>2</INF> generated by reaction in the process and by 
combustion of process off-gas in stationary combustion units and flares.
    (1) If you comply with Sec. 98.243(b) or (d), report under this 
subpart the calculated CO<INF>2</INF>, CH<INF>4</INF>, and 
N<INF>2</INF>O emissions for each stationary combustion source and flare 
that burns any amount of petrochemical process off-gas. If you comply 
with Sec. 98.243(b), also report under this subpart the measured 
CO<INF>2</INF> emissions from process vents routed to stacks that are 
not associated with stationary combustion units.
    (2) If you comply with Sec. 98.243(c), report under this subpart 
the calculated CO<INF>2</INF> emissions for each petrochemical process 
unit.
    (b) CO<INF>2</INF>, CH<INF>4</INF>, and N<INF>2</INF>O combustion 
emissions from stationary combustion units.
    (1) If you comply with Sec. 98.243(b) or (d), report these 
emissions from stationary combustion units that are associated with 
petrochemical process units and burn only supplemental fuel under 
subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources) by 
following the requirements of subpart C.
    (2) If you comply with Sec. 98.243(c), report CO<INF>2</INF>, 
CH<INF>4</INF>, and N<INF>2</INF>O combustion emissions under subpart C 
of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources) by following 
the requirements of subpart C only for the combustion of supplemental 
fuel. Determine the applicable Tier in subpart C of this part (General 
Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources) based on the maximum rated heat 
input capacity of the stationary combustion source.
    (c) CO<INF>2</INF> captured. You must report the mass of 
CO<INF>2</INF> captured under, subpart PP of this part (Suppliers of

Sec. 98.243  Calculating GHG emissions.

    (a) If you route all process vent emissions and emissions from 
combustion of process off-gas to one or more stacks and use CEMS on each 
stack to measure CO<INF>2</INF> emissions (except flare stacks), then 
you must determine process-based GHG emissions in accordance with 
paragraph (b) of this section. Otherwise, determine process-based GHG 
emissions in accordance with the procedures specified in paragraph (c) 
or (d) of this section.
    (b) Continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS). Route all process 
vent emissions and emissions from combustion of process off-gas to one 
or more stacks and determine CO<INF>2</INF> emissions from each stack 
(except flare stacks) according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology 
requirements in subpart C of this part. For each stack (except flare 
stacks) that includes emissions from combustion of petrochemical process 
off-gas, calculate CH<INF>4</INF> and N<INF>2</INF>0 emissions in 
accordance with subpart C of this part (use the Tier 3 methodology, 
emission factors for ``Petroleum'' in Table C-2 of subpart C of this 
part, and either the default high heat value for fuel gas in Table C-1 
of subpart C of this part or a calculated HHV, as allowed in Equation C-
8 of subpart C of this part).For each flare, calculate CO<INF>2</INF>, 
CH<INF>4</INF>, and N<INF>2</INF>O emissions using the methodology 
specified in Sec. 98.253(b)(1) through (b)(3).
    (c) Mass balance for each petrochemical process unit. Calculate the 
emissions of CO<INF>2</INF> from each process unit, for each calendar 
month as described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(5) of this section.
    (1) For each gaseous and liquid feedstock and product, measure the 
volume or mass used or produced each calendar month with a flow meter by 
following the procedures specified in Sec. 98.244(b)(2).

[[Page 624]]

Alternatively, for liquids, you may calculate the volume used or 
collected in each month based on measurements of the liquid level in a 
storage tank at least once per month (and just prior to each change in 
direction of the level of the liquid) following the procedures specified 
in Sec. 98.244(b)(3). Fuels used for combustion purposes are not 
considered to be feedstocks.
    (2) For each solid feedstock and product, measure the mass used or 
produced each calendar month by following the procedures specified in 
Sec. 98.244(b)(1).
    (3) Collect a sample of each feedstock and product at least once per 
month and determine the carbon content of each sample according to the 
procedures of Sec. 98.244(b)(4). If multiple valid carbon content 
measurements are made during the monthly measurement period, average 
them arithmetically. However, if a particular liquid or solid feedstock 
is delivered in lots, and if multiple deliveries of the same feedstock 
are received from the same supply source in a given calendar month, only 
one representative sample is required. Alternatively, you may use the 
results of analyses conducted by a fuel or feedstock supplier, provided 
the sampling and analysis is conducted at least once per month using any 
of the procedures specified in Sec. 98.244(b)(4).
    (4) If you determine that the monthly average concentration of a 
specific compound in a feedstock or product is greater than 99.5 percent 
by volume (or mass for liquids and solids), then as an alternative to 
the sampling and analysis specified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, 
you may calculate the carbon content assuming 100 percent of that 
feedstock or product is the specific compound during periods of normal 
operation. You must maintain records of any determination made in 
accordance with this paragraph (c)(4) along with all supporting data, 
calculations, and other information. This alternative may not be used 
for products during periods of operation when off-specification product 
is produced. You must reevaluate determinations made under this 
paragraph (c)(4) after any process change that affects the feedstock or 
product composition. You must keep records of the process change and the 
corresponding composition determinations. If the feedstock or product 
composition changes so that the average monthly concentration falls 
below 99.5 percent, you are no longer permitted to use this alternative 
method.
    (5) Calculate the CO<INF>2</INF> mass emissions for each 
petrochemical process unit using Equations X-1 through X-4 of this 
section.
    (i) Gaseous feedstocks and products. Use Equation X-1 of this 
section to calculate the net annual carbon input or output from gaseous 
feedstocks and products. Note that the result will be a negative value 
if there are no gaseous feedstocks in the process but there are gaseous 
products.

    (1) Calculate the CO<INF>2</INF> emissions according to the 
applicable requirements in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(iii) of 
this section.
    (i) Flow measurement. If you have a continuous flow monitor on the 
flare, you must use the measured flow rates when the monitor is 
operational and the flow rate is within the calibrated range of the 
measurement device to calculate the flare gas flow. If you do not have a

measurement device, you must use engineering calculations, company 
records, or similar estimates of volumetric flare gas flow.
    (ii) Heat value or carbon content measurement. If you have a 
continuous higher heating value monitor or gas composition monitor on 
the flare or if you monitor these parameters at least weekly, you must 
use the measured heat value or carbon content value in calculating the 
CO<INF>2</INF> emissions from the flare using the applicable methods in 
paragraphs (b)(1)(ii)(A) and (b)(1)(ii)(B).
    (A) If you monitor gas composition, calculate the CO<INF>2</INF> 
emissions from the flare using either Equation Y-1a or Equation Y-1b of 
this section. If daily or more frequent measurement data are available, 
you must use daily values when using Equation Y-1a or Equation Y-1b of 
this section; otherwise, use weekly values.

of this section regardless of the concentration of CO<INF>2</INF> in the

(General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources). For the purposes of this 
subpart, the sour gas stream for which monitoring is required according 
to paragraphs (f)(2) through (f)(5) of this section is not considered a 
fuel.

recovery plant or if you monitor gas composition for carbon content on a 
routine basis, you must use the measured carbon content value.

    (5) If tail gas is recycled to the front of the sulfur recovery 
plant and the recycled flow rate and carbon content is included in the 
measured data under paragraphs (f)(2) and (f)(3) of this section, 
respectively, then the annual CO<INF>2</INF> emissions calculated in 
paragraph (f)(4) of this section must be corrected to avoid double 
counting these emissions. You may use engineering estimates to perform 
this correction or assume that the corrected CO<INF>2</INF> emissions 
are 95 percent of the uncorrected value calculated using Equation Y-12 
of this section.
    (g) For coke calcining units, calculate GHG emissions according to

Sec. 98.255  Procedures for estimating missing data.

    A complete record of all measured parameters used in the GHG 
emissions calculations is required (e.g., concentrations, flow rates, 
fuel heating values, carbon content values). Therefore, whenever a 
quality-assured value of a required parameter is unavailable (e.g., if a 
CEMS malfunctions during unit operation or if a required fuel sample is 
not taken), a substitute data value for the missing parameter shall be 
used in the calculations.
    (a) For stationary combustion sources, use the missing data 
procedures in subpart C of this part.
    (b) For each missing value of the heat content, carbon content, or 
molecular weight of the fuel, substitute the arithmetic average of the 
quality-assured values of that parameter immediately preceding and 
immediately following the missing data incident. If the ``after'' value 
is not obtained by the end of the reporting year, you may use the 
``before'' value for the missing data substitution. If, for a particular 
parameter, no quality-assured data are available prior to the missing 
data incident, the substitute data value shall be the first quality-
assured value obtained after the missing data period.
    (c) For missing CO<INF>2</INF>, CO, O<INF>2</INF>, CH<INF>4</INF>, 
or N<INF>2</INF>O concentrations, gas flow rate, and percent moisture, 
the substitute data

GHG emissions data according to the applicable requirements in Sec. 
98.34. All QA/QC data must be available for inspection upon request.
    (b) Fuel properties needed to perform the calculations in Equations 
AA-1 and AA-2 of this subpart must be determined according to paragraphs 
(b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section.
    (1) High heat values of black liquor must be determined no less than 
annually using T684 om-06 Gross Heating Value of Black Liquor, TAPPI 
(incorporated by reference, see Sec. 98.7). If measurements are 
performed more frequently than annually, then the high heat value used 
in Equation AA-1 of this subpart must be based on the average of the 
representative measurements made during the year.
    (2) The annual mass of spent liquor solids must be determined using 
either of the methods specified in paragraph (b)(2)(i) or (b)(2)(ii) of 
this section.
    (i) Measure the mass of spent liquor solids annually (or more 
frequently) using T-650 om-05 Solids Content of Black Liquor, TAPPI 
(incorporated by reference in Sec. 98.7). If measurements are performed 
more frequently than annually, then the mass of spent liquor solids used 
in Equation AA-1 of this subpart must be based on the average of the 
representative measurements made during the year.

[[Page 658]]

    (ii) Determine the annual mass of spent liquor solids based on 
records of measurements made with an online measurement system that 
determines the mass of spent liquor solids fired in a chemical recovery 
furnace or chemical recovery combustion unit.
    (3) Carbon analyses for spent pulping liquor must be determined no 
less than annually using ASTM D5373-08 Standard Test Methods for 
Instrumental Determination of Carbon, Hydrogen, and Nitrogen in 
Laboratory Samples of Coal (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 98.7). 
If measurements using ASTM D5373-08 are performed more frequently than 
annually, then the spent pulping liquor carbon content used in Equation 
AA-2 of this subpart must be based on the average of the representative 
measurements made during the year.
    (c) Each facility must keep records that include a detailed 
explanation of how company records of measurements are used to estimate 
GHG emissions. The owner or operator must also document the procedures 
used to ensure the accuracy of the measurements of fuel, spent liquor 
solids, and makeup chemical usage, including, but not limited to 
calibration of weighing equipment, fuel flow meters, and other 
measurement devices. The estimated accuracy of measurements made with 
these devices must be recorded and the technical basis for these 
estimates must be provided. The procedures used to convert spent pulping 
liquor flow rates to units of mass (i.e., spent liquor solids firing 
rates) also must be documented.
    (d) Records must be made available upon request for verification of 
the calculations and measurements.


<R05>
Sec. 98.275  Procedures for estimating missing data.

    A complete record of all measured parameters used in the GHG 
emissions calculations is required. Therefore, whenever a quality-
assured value of a required parameter is unavailable (e.g., if a meter 
malfunctions during unit operation or if a required sample is not 
taken), a substitute data value for the missing parameter shall be used 
in the calculations, according to the requirements of paragraphs (a) 
through (c) of this section:
    (a) There are no missing data procedures for measurements of heat 
content and carbon content of spent pulping liquor. A re-test must be 
performed if the data from any annual measurements are determined to be 
invalid.
    (b) For missing measurements of the mass of spent liquor solids or 
spent pulping liquor flow rates, use the lesser value of either the 
maximum mass or fuel flow rate for the combustion unit, or the maximum 
mass or flow rate that the fuel meter can measure.
    (c) For the use of makeup chemicals (carbonates), the substitute 
data value shall be the best available estimate of makeup chemical 
consumption, based on available data (e.g., past accounting records, 
production rates). The owner or operator shall document and keep records 
of the procedures used for all such estimates.

<R05>
Sec. 98.294  Monitoring and QA/QC requirements.

    Section 98.293 provides three different procedures for emission 
calculations. The appropriate paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section 
should be used for the procedure chosen.
    (a) If you determine your emissions using Sec. 98.293(b)(2) 
(Equation CC-1 of this subpart) you must:
    (1) Determine the monthly inorganic carbon content of the trona from 
a weekly composite analysis for each soda ash manufacturing line, using 
a modified version of ASTM E359-00 (Reapproved 2005)e1, Standard Test 
Methods for Analysis of Soda Ash (Sodium Carbonate) (incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 98.7). ASTM E359-00(Reapproved 2005) e1 is designed 
to measure the total alkalinity in soda ash not in trona. The modified 
method referred to above adjusts the regular ASTM method to express the 
results in terms of trona. Although ASTM E359-00 (Reapproved 2005) e1 
uses manual titration, suitable autotitrators may also be used for this 
determination.
    (2) Measure the mass of trona input produced by each soda ash 
manufacturing line on a monthly basis using belt scales or methods used 
for accounting purposes.
    (3) Document the procedures used to ensure the accuracy of the 
monthly measurements of trona consumed.
    (b) If you calculate CO<INF>2</INF> process emissions based on soda 
ash production (Sec. 98.293(b)(2) Equation CC-2 of this subpart), you 
must:
    (1) Determine the inorganic carbon content of the soda ash (i.e., 
soda ash purity) using ASTM E359-00 (Reapproved 2005) e1 Standard Test 
Methods for Analysis of Soda Ash (Sodium Carbonate) (incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 98.7). Although ASTM E359-00 (Reapproved 2005) e1 
uses manual titration, suitable autotitrators may also be used for this 
determination.
    (2) Measure the mass of soda ash produced by each soda ash 
manufacturing line on a monthly basis using belt scales, by weighing the 
soda ash at the truck or rail loadout points of your facility, or 
methods used for accounting purposes.
    (3) Document the procedures used to ensure the accuracy of the 
monthly measurements of soda ash produced.
    (c) If you calculate CO<INF>2</INF> emissions using the site-
specific emission factor method in Sec. 98.293(b)(3), you must:
    (1) Conduct an annual performance test that is based on 
representative performance (i.e., performance based on normal operating 
conditions) of the affected process.
    (2) Sample the stack gas and conduct three emissions test runs of 1 
hour each.
    (3) Conduct the stack test using EPA Method 3A at 40 CFR part 60, 
appendix A-2 to measure the CO<INF>2</INF> concentration, Method 2, 2A, 
2C, 2D, or 2F at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-1 or Method 26 at 40 CFR 
part 60, appendix A-2 to determine the stack gas volumetric flow rate. 
All QA/QC procedures specified in the reference test methods and any 
associated performance specifications apply. For each test, the facility 
must prepare an emission factor determination report that must include 
the items in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) through (c)(3)(iii) of this section.
    (i) Analysis of samples, determination of emissions, and raw data.
    (ii) All information and data used to derive the emissions 
factor(s).
    (iii) You must determine the average process vent flow rate from the 
mine water stripper/evaporater during each test and document how it was 
determined.
    (4) You must also determine the annual vent flow rate from the mine 
water stripper/evaporater from monthly information using the same plant 
instruments or procedures used for accounting purposes (i.e., volumetric 
flow meter).

Sec. 98.295  Procedures for estimating missing data.

    For the emission calculation methodologies in Sec. 98.293(b)(2) and 
(b)(3), a complete record of all measured parameters used in the GHG 
emissions calculations is required (e.g., inorganic carbon content 
values, etc.). Therefore, whenever a quality-assured value of a

[[Page 666]]

required parameter is unavailable, a substitute data value for the 
missing parameter shall be used in the calculations as specified in the 
paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section. You must document and keep 
records of the procedures used for all such missing value estimates.
    (a) For each missing value of the weekly composite of inorganic 
carbon content of either soda ash or trona, the substitute data value 
shall be the arithmetic average of the quality-assured values of 
inorganic carbon contents from the week immediately preceding and the 
week immediately following the missing data incident. If no quality-
assured data on inorganic carbon contents are available prior to the 
missing data incident, the substitute data value shall be the first 
quality-assured value for carbon contents obtained after the missing 
data period.
    (b) For each missing value of either the monthly soda ash production 
or the trona consumption, the substitute data value shall be the best 
available estimate(s) of the parameter(s), based on all available 
process data or data used for accounting purposes.
    (c) For each missing value collected during the performance test 
(hourly CO<INF>2</INF> concentration, stack gas volumetric flow rate, or 
average process vent flow from mine water stripper/evaporator during 
performance test), you must repeat the annual performance test following 
the calculation and monitoring and QA/QC requirements under Sec. Sec. 
98.293(b)(3) and 98.294(c).
    (d) For each missing value of the monthly process vent flow rate 
from mine water stripper/evaporator, the subsititute data value shall be 
the best available estimate(s) of the parameter(s), based on all 
available process data or the lesser of the maximum capacity of the 
system or the maximum rate the meter can measure.

    (1) Review inputs to Equation DD-1 of this section to ensure inputs 
and outputs to the company's system are included.
    (2) Do not enter negative inputs and confirm that negative emissions 
are not calculated. However, the Decrease in SF<INF>6</INF> Inventory 
and the Net Increase in Total Nameplate Capacity may be calculated as 
negative numbers.
    (3) Ensure that beginning-of-year inventory matches end-of-year 
inventory from the previous year.
    (4) Ensure that in addition to SF<INF>6</INF> purchased from bulk 
gas distributors, SF<INF>6</INF> purchased from Original Equipment 
Manufacturers (OEM) and SF<INF>6</INF> returned to the facility from 
off-site recycling are also accounted for among the total additions.
    (c) Ensure the following QA/QC methods are employed throughout the 
year:
    (1) Ensure that cylinders returned to the gas supplier are 
consistently weighed on a scale that is certified to be accurate and 
precise to within 2 pounds of the scale's capacity and is periodically 
recalibrated per the manufacturer's specifications. Either measure 
residual gas (the amount of gas remaining in returned cylinders) or have 
the gas supplier measure it. If the gas supplier weighs the residual 
gas, obtain from the gas supplier a detailed monthly accounting, within 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq> 2 pounds, of residual gas amounts in the 
cylinders returned to the gas supplier.
    (2) Ensure that cylinders weighed for the beginning and end of year 
inventory measurements are weighed on a scale that is certified to be 
accurate to within 2 pounds of the scale's capacity and is periodically 
recalibrated per the manufacturer's specifications. All scales used to 
measure quantities that are to be reported under Sec. 98.306 must be 
calibrated using calibration procedures specified by the scale 
manufacturer. Calibration must be performed prior to the first reporting 
year. After the initial calibration, recalibration must be performed at 
the minimum frequency specified by the manufacturer.
    (3) Ensure all substations have provided information to the manager 
compiling the emissions report (if it is not already handled through an 
electronic inventory system).
    (d) GHG Monitoring Plans, as described in Sec. 98.3(g)(5), must be 
completed by April 1, 2011.

through (c) of this section. You must document and keep records of the 
procedures used for all such estimates.
    (a) For each missing value of the monthly carbon content of calcined 
petroleum coke the substitute data value shall be the arithmetic average 
of the quality-assured values of carbon contents for the month 
immediately preceding and the month immediately following the missing 
data incident. If no quality-assured data on carbon contents are 
available prior to the missing data incident, the substitute data value 
shall be the first quality-assured value for carbon contents obtained 
after the missing data period.
    (b) For each missing value of the monthly calcined petroleum coke 
consumption and/or carbon-containing waste, the substitute data value 
shall be the best available estimate of the monthly petroleum coke 
consumption based on all available process data or information used for 
accounting purposes (such as purchase records).

Sec. 98.324  Monitoring and QA/QC requirements.

    (a) For calendar year 2011 monitoring, the facility may submit a 
request to the Administrator to use one or more best available 
monitoring methods as listed in Sec. 98.3(d)(1)(i) through (iv). The 
request must be submitted no later than October 12, 2010 and must 
contain the information in Sec. 98.3(d)(2)(ii). To obtain approval, the 
request must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it is 
not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required 
piece of monitoring equipment by January 1, 2011. The use of best 
available monitoring methods will not be approved beyond December 31, 
2011.
    (b) For CH<INF>4</INF> liberated from ventilation systems, determine 
whether CH<INF>4</INF> will be monitored from each ventilation well and 
shaft, from a centralized monitoring point, or from a combination of the 
two options. Operators are allowed flexibility for aggregating emissions 
from more than one ventilation well or shaft, as long as emissions from 
all are addressed, and the methodology for calculating total emissions 
documented. Monitor by one of the following options:
    (1) Collect quarterly or more frequent grab samples (with no fewer 
than 6 weeks between measurements) and make quarterly measurements of 
flow rate, temperature, and pressure. The sampling and measurements must 
be made at the same locations as MSHA inspection samples are taken, and 
should be taken when the mine is operating under normal conditions. You

[[Page 678]]

must follow MSHA sampling procedures as set forth in the MSHA Handbook 
entitled, General Coal Mine Inspection Procedures and Inspection 
Tracking System Handbook Number: PH-08-V-1, January 1, 2008 
(incorporated by reference, see Sec. 98.7). You must record the date of 
sampling, airflow, temperature, and pressure measured, the hand-held 
methane and oxygen readings (percent), the bottle number of samples 
collected, and the location of the measurement or collection.
    (2) Obtain results of the quarterly (or more frequent) testing 
performed by MSHA.
    (3) Monitor emissions through the use of one or more continuous 
emission monitoring systems (CEMS). If operators use CEMS as the basis 
for emissions reporting, they must provide documentation on the process 
for using data obtained from their CEMS to estimate emissions from their 
mine ventilation systems.
    (c) For CH<INF>4</INF> liberated at degasification systems, 
determine whether CH<INF>4</INF> will be monitored from each well and 
gob gas vent hole, from a centralized monitoring point, or from a 
combination of the two options. Operators are allowed flexibility for 
aggregating emissions from more than one well or gob gas vent hole, as 
long as emissions from all are addressed, and the methodology for 
calculating total emissions documented. Monitor both gas volume and 
methane concentration by one of the following two options:
    (1) Monitor emissions through the use of one or more continuous 
emissions monitoring systems (CEMS).
    (2) Collect weekly (once each calendar week, with at least three 
days between measurements) or more frequent samples, for all 
degasification wells and gob gas vent holes. Determine weekly or more 
frequent flow rates and methane composition from these degasification 
wells and gob gas vent holes. Methane composition should be determined 
either by submitting samples to a lab for analysis, or from the use of 
methanometers at the degasification well site. Follow the sampling 
protocols for sampling of methane emissions from ventilation shafts, as 
described in Sec. 98.324(b)(1).

    (a) A complete record of all measured parameters used in the GHG 
emissions calculations is required. Therefore, whenever a quality-
assured value of a required parameter is unavailable (e.g., if a meter 
malfunctions during unit operation or if a required fuel sample is not 
taken), a substitute data value for the missing parameter shall be used 
in the calculations, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.

rate, temperature, and pressure for ventilation and degasification 
systems, the substitute data value shall be the arithmetic average of 
the quality-assured values of that parameter immediately preceding and 
immediately following the missing data incident. If, for a particular 
parameter, no quality-assured data are available prior to the missing 
data incident, the substitute data value shall be the first quality-
assured value obtained after the missing data period.

<R05>
Sec. 98.343  Calculating GHG emissions.

    (a) For all landfills subject to the reporting requirements of this 
subpart, calculate annual modeled CH<INF>4</INF> generation according to 
the applicable requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this 
section.
    (1) Calculate annual modeled CH<INF>4</INF> generation using 
Equation HH-1 of this section.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28OC10.033

Where:

G<INF>CH4</INF> = Modeled methane generation rate in reporting year T 
(metric tons CH<INF>4</INF>).
x = Year in which waste was disposed.
S = Start year of calculation. Use the year 1960 or the opening year of 
the landfill, whichever is more recent.
T = Reporting year for which emissions are calculated.
W<INF>X</INF> = Quantity of waste disposed in the landfill in year x 
from measurement data, tipping fee receipts, or other company records 
(metric tons, as received (wet weight)).
MCF = Methane correction factor (fraction). Use the default value of 1 
unless there is active aeration of waste within the landfill during the 
reporting year. If there is active aeration of waste within the landfill 
during the reporting year, use either the default

[[Page 685]]

value of 1 or select an alternative value no less than 0.5 based on 
site-specific aeration parameters.
DOC = Degradable organic carbon from Table HH-1 of this subpart or 
measurement data, if available [fraction (metric tons C/metric ton 
waste)].
DOC<INF>F</INF> = Fraction of DOC dissimilated (fraction). Use the 
default value of 0.5.
F = Fraction by volume of CH<INF>4</INF> in landfill gas from 
measurement data on a dry basis, if available (fraction); default is 
0.5.
k = Rate constant from Table HH-1 to this subpart (yr<SUP>-</SUP>\1\). 
Select the most applicable k value for the majority of the past 10 years 
(or operating life, whichever is shorter).

    (2) For years when material-specific waste quantity data are 
available, apply Equation HH-1 of this section for each waste quantity 
type and sum the CH<INF>4</INF> generation rates for all waste types to 
calculate the total modeled CH<INF>4</INF> generation rate for the 
landfill. Use the appropriate parameter values for k, DOC, MCF, 
DOC<INF>F</INF>, and F shown in Table HH-1 of this subpart. The annual 
quantity of each type of waste disposed must be calculated as the sum of 
the daily quantities of waste (of that type) disposed. You may use the 
bulk waste parameters for a portion of your waste materials when using 
the material-specific modeling approach for mixed waste streams that 
cannot be designated to a specific material type. For years when waste 
composition data are not available, use the bulk waste parameter values 
for k and DOC in Table HH-1 to this subpart for the total quantity of 
waste disposed in those years.
    (3) Beginning in the first emissions reporting year and for each 
year thereafter, if scales are in place, you must determine the annual 
quantity of waste (in metric tons as received, i.e., wet weight) 
disposed of in the landfill using paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section 
for all containers and for all vehicles used to haul waste to the 
landfill, except for passenger cars, light duty pickup trucks, or waste 
loads that cannot be measured using the scales due to physical 
limitations (load cannot physically access or fit on the scale) and/or 
operational limitations of the scale (load exceeding the limits or 
sensitivity range of the scale). If scales are not in place, you must 
use paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section to determine the annual 
quantity of waste disposed. For waste hauled to the landfill in 
passenger cars or light duty pickup trucks, you may use either paragraph 
(a)(3)(i) or paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section to determine the 
annual quantity of waste disposed. For loads that cannot be measured 
using the scales due to physical and/or operational limitations of the 
scale, you must use paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section or similar 
engineering calculations to determine the annual quantity of waste 
disposed. The approach used to determine the annual quantity of waste 
disposed of must be documented in the monitoring plan.
    (i) Use direct mass measurements of each individual load received at 
the landfill using either of the following methods:
    (A) Weigh using mass scales each vehicle or container used to haul 
waste as it enters the landfill or disposal area; weigh using mass 
scales each vehicle or container after it has off-loaded the waste; 
determine the quantity of waste received from the individual load as the 
difference in the two mass measurements; and determine the annual 
quantity of waste received as the sum of all waste loads received during 
the year. Alternatively, you may determine annual quantity of waste by 
summing the weights of all vehicles and containers entering the landfill 
and subtracting from it the sum of all the weights of vehicles and 
containers after they have off-loaded the waste in the landfill.
    (B) Weigh using mass scales each vehicle or container used to haul 
waste as it enters the landfill or disposal area; determine a 
representative tare weight by vehicle or container type by weighing no 
less than 5 of each type of vehicle or container after it has off-loaded 
the waste; determine the quantity of waste received from the individual 
load as the difference between the measured weight in and the tare 
weight determined for that container/vehicle type; and determine the 
annual quantity of waste received as the sum of all waste loads received 
during the year.
    (ii) Determine the working capacity in units of mass for each type 
of container or vehicle used to haul waste to

[[Page 686]]

the landfill (e.g., using volumetric capacity and waste density 
measurements; direct measurement of a selected number of passenger 
vehicles and light duty pick-up trucks; or similar methods); record the 
number of loads received at the landfill by vehicle/container type; 
calculate the annual mass per vehicle/container type as the mass product 
of the number of loads of that vehicle/container multiplied by its 
working capacity; and calculate the annual quantity of waste received as 
the sum of the annual mass per vehicle/container type across all of the 
vehicle/container types used to haul waste to the landfill.
    (4) For years prior to the first emissions reporting year, use 
methods in paragraph (a)(3) of this section when waste disposal quantity 
data are readily available. When waste disposal quantity data are not 
readily available, W<INF>X</INF> shall be estimated using one of the 
applicable methods in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) through (a)(4)(iii) of this 
section. You must determine which method is most applicable to the 
conditions and disposal history of your facility. Historical waste 
disposal quantities should only be determined once, as part of the first 
annual report, and the same values should be used for all subsequent 
annual reports, supplemented by the next year's data on new waste 
disposal.
    (i) Assume all prior years waste disposal quantities are the same as 
the waste quantity in the first year for which waste quantities are 
available.
    (ii) Use the estimated population served by the landfill in each 
year, the values for national average per capita waste disposal rates 
found in Table HH-2 to this subpart, and calculate the waste quantity 
landfilled using Equation HH-2 of this section.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28OC10.034

Where:

W<INF>X</INF> = Quantity of waste placed in the landfill in year x 
          (metric tons, wet basis).

          Table HH-2 to this subpart (metric tons per capita per year, 
          wet basis; tons/cap/yr).

    (iii) Use a constant average waste disposal quantity calculated 
using Equation HH-3 of this section for each year the landfill was in 
operation (i.e., from the first year accepting waste until the last year 
for which waste disposal data is unavailable, inclusive).
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28OC10.035

Where:

W<INF>X</INF> = Quantity of waste placed in the landfill in year x 
          (metric tons, wet basis).
LFC = Landfill capacity or, for operating landfills, capacity of the 
          landfill used (or the total quantity of waste-in-place) at the 
          end of the year prior to the year when waste disposal data are 
          available from design drawings or engineering estimates 
          (metric tons).
YrData = Year in which the landfill last received waste or, for 
          operating landfills, the year prior to the first reporting 
          year when waste disposal data is first available from company 
          records, or best available data.
YrOpen = Year in which the landfill first received waste from company 
          records or best available data. If no data are available for 
          estimating YrOpen for a closed landfill, use 30 years as the 
          default operating life of the landfill.

    (b) For landfills with gas collection systems, calculate the 
quantity of CH<INF>4</INF> destroyed according to the requirements in 
paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section.
    (1) If you continuously monitor the flow rate, CH<INF>4</INF> 
concentration, temperature, pressure, and, if necessary, moisture 
content of the landfill gas that is collected and routed to a 
destruction device (before any treatment equipment) using a monitoring 
meter specifically for CH<INF>4</INF> gas, as specified in Sec. 98.344, 
you must use this monitoring system and calculate the quantity of 
CH<INF>4</INF> recovered for destruction using Equation HH-4 of this 
section. A fully integrated system that directly reports CH<INF>4</INF> 
content requires no other calculation than summing the results of all 
monitoring periods for a given year.

          paragraph (b)(2) of this section, use N=52.
n = Index for measurement period.
(V)<INF>n</INF> = Cumulative volumetric flow for the measurement period 
          in actual cubic feet (acf). If the flow rate meter 
          automatically corrects for temperature and pressure, replace 
          ``520[deg]R/(T)<INF>n</INF> x (P)<INF>n</INF>/1 atm'' with 
          ``1''.
(K<INF>MC</INF>)<INF>n</INF> = Moisture correction term for the 
          measurement period, volumetric basis, as follows: 
          (K<INF>MC</INF>)<INF>n</INF> = 1 when (V)<INF>n</INF> and 
          (C)<INF>n</INF> are both measured on a dry basis or if both 
          are measured on a wet basis; (K<INF>MC</INF>)<INF>n</INF> = 
          [1-(f<INF>H</INF>2<INF>O</INF>)<INF>n</INF>] when 
          (V)<INF>n</INF> is measured on a wet basis and (C)<INF>n</INF> 
          is measured on a dry basis; and (K<INF>MC</INF>)<INF>n</INF> = 
          1/[1-(f<INF>H2O</INF>)<INF>n</INF>] when (V)<INF>n</INF> is 
          measured on a dry basis and (C)<INF>n</INF> is measured on a 
          wet basis.

          Fahrenheit and 1 atm.
(T)<INF>n</INF> = Average temperature at which flow is measured for the 
          measurement period ([deg]R).
(P)<INF>n</INF> = Average pressure at which flow is measured for the 
          measurement period (atm).
0.454/1,000 = Conversion factor (metric ton/lb).

    (2) If you do not continuously monitor according to paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section, you must determine the flow rate, CH<INF>4</INF> 
concentration, temperature, pressure, and moisture content of the 
landfill gas that is collected and routed to a destruction device 
(before any treatment equipment) according to the requirements in 
paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (b)(2)(iii) of this section and calculate 
the quantity of CH<INF>4</INF> recovered for destruction using Equation 
HH-4 of this section.
    (i) Continuously monitor gas flow rate and determine the cumulative 
volume of landfill gas each week and the cumulative volume of landfill 
gas each year that is collected and routed to a destruction device 
(before any treatment equipment). Under this option, the gas flow meter 
is not required to automatically correct for temperature, pressure, or, 
if necessary, moisture content. If the gas flow meter is not equipped 
with automatic correction for temperature, pressure, or, if necessary, 
moisture content, you must determine these parameters as specified in 
paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section.
    (ii) Determine the CH<INF>4</INF> concentration in the landfill gas 
that is collected and routed to a destruction device (before any 
treatment equipment) in a location near or representative of the 
location of the gas flow meter at least once each calendar week; if only 
one measurement is made each calendar week, there must be at least three 
days between measurements.
    (iii) If the gas flow meter is not equipped with automatic 
correction for temperature, pressure, or, if necessary, moisture 
content:
    (A) Determine the temperature and pressure in the landfill gas that 
is collected and routed to a destruction device (before any treatment 
equipment) in a location near or representative of the location of the 
gas flow meter at least once each calendar week; if only one measurement 
is made each calendar week, there must be at least three days between 
measurements.
    (B) If the CH<INF>4</INF> concentration is determined on a dry basis 
and flow is determined on a wet basis or CH<INF>4</INF> concentration is 
determined on a wet basis and flow is determined on a dry basis, and the 
flow meter does not automatically correct for moisture content, 
determine the moisture content in the landfill gas that is collected and 
routed to a destruction device (before any treatment equipment) in a 
location near or representative of the location of the

[[Page 688]]

gas flow meter at least once each calendar week; if only one measurement 
is made each calendar week, there must be at least three days between 
measurements.
    (c) For all landfills, calculate CH<INF>4</INF> generation (adjusted 
for oxidation in cover materials) and actual CH<INF>4</INF> emissions 
(taking into account any CH<INF>4</INF> recovery, and oxidation in cover 
materials) according to the applicable methods in paragraphs (c)(1) 
through (c)(3) of this section.
    (1) Calculate CH<INF>4</INF> generation, adjusted for oxidation,

Sec. 98.345  Procedures for estimating missing data.

    A complete record of all measured parameters used in the GHG 
emissions calculations is required. Therefore, whenever a quality-
assured value of a required parameter is unavailable (e.g., if a meter 
malfunctions during unit operation or if a required fuel sample is not 
taken), a substitute data value for the missing parameter shall be used 
in the calculations, according to the requirements in paragraphs (a) 
through (c) of this section.
    (a) For each missing value of the CH<INF>4</INF> content, the 
substitute data value shall be the arithmetic average of the quality-
assured values of that parameter immediately preceding and immediately 
following the missing data incident. If the ``after'' value is not 
obtained by the end of the reporting year, you may use the ``before'' 
value for the missing data substitution. If, for a particular parameter, 
no quality-assured

[[Page 691]]

data are available prior to the missing data incident, the substitute 
data value shall be the first quality-assured value obtained after the 
missing data period.
    (b) For missing gas flow rates, the substitute data value shall be 
the arithmetic average of the quality-assured values of that parameter 
immediately preceding and immediately following the missing data 
incident. If the ``after'' value is not obtained by the end of the 
reporting year, you may use the ``before'' value for the missing data 
substitution. If, for a particular parameter, no quality-assured data 
are available prior to the missing data incident, the substitute data 
value shall be the first quality-assured value obtained after the 
missing data period.
    (c) For missing daily waste disposal quantity data for disposal in 
reporting years, the substitute value shall be the average daily waste 
disposal quantity for that day of the week as measured on the week 
before and week after the missing daily data.

Sec. 98.346  Data reporting requirements.

    In addition to the information required by Sec. 98.3(c), each 
annual report must contain the following information for each landfill.
    (a) A classification of the landfill as ``open'' (actively received 
waste in the reporting year) or ``closed'' (no longer receiving waste), 
the year in which the landfill first started accepting waste for 
disposal, the last year the landfill accepted waste (for open landfills, 
enter the estimated year of landfill closure), the capacity (in metric 
tons) of the landfill, an indication of whether leachate recirculation 
is used during the reporting year and its typical frequency of use over 
the past 10 years (e.g., used several times a year for the past 10 
years, used at least once a year for the past 10 years, used 
occasionally but not every year over the past 10 years, not used), an 
indication as to whether scales are present at the landfill, and the 
waste disposal quantity for each year of landfilling required to be 
included when using Equation HH-1 of this subpart (in metric tons, wet 
weight).
    (b) Method for estimating reporting year and historical waste 
disposal quantities, reason for its selection, and the range of years it 
is applied. For years when waste quantity data are determined using the 
methods in Sec. 98.343(a)(3), report separately the quantity of waste 
determined using the methods in Sec. 98.343(a)(3)(i) and the quantity 
of waste determined using the methods in Sec. 98.343(a)(3)(ii). For 
historical waste disposal quantities that were not determined using the 
methods in Sec. 98.343(a)(3), provide the population served by the 
landfill for each year the Equation HH-2 of this subpart is applied, if 
applicable, or, for open landfills using Equation HH-3 of this subpart, 
provide the value of landfill capacity (LFC) used in the calculation.
    (c) Waste composition for each year required for Equation HH-1 of 
this subpart, in percentage by weight, for each waste category listed in 
Table HH-1 to this subpart that is used in Equation HH-1 of this subpart

    (d) For each waste type used to calculate CH<INF>4</INF> generation 
using Equation HH-1 of this subpart, you must report:
    (1) Degradable organic carbon (DOC), methane correction factor 
(MCF), and fraction of DOC dissimilated (DOC<INF>F</INF>) values used in 
the calculations. If an MCF value other than the default of 1 is used, 
provide an indication of whether active aeration of the waste in the 
landfill was conducted during the reporting year, a description of the 
aeration system, including aeration blower capacity, the fraction of the 
landfill containing waste affected by the aeration, the total number of 
hours during the year the aeration blower was operated, and other 
factors used as a basis for the selected MCF value.
    (2) Decay rate (k) value used in the calculations.
    (e) Fraction of CH<INF>4</INF> in landfill gas (F) and an indication 
of whether the fraction of CH<INF>4</INF> was determined based on 
measured values or the default value.
    (f) The surface area of the landfill containing waste (in square 
meters), identification of the type of cover material used (as either 
organic cover, clay cover, sand cover, or other soil mixtures). If 
multiple cover types are used, the surface area associated with each 
cover type.

CH<INF>4</INF>, and an indication of whether passive vents and/or 
passive flares (vents or flares that are not considered part of the gas 
collection system as defined in Sec. 98.6) are present at this 
landfill.
    (i) For landfills with gas collection systems, you must report:
    (1) Total volumetric flow of landfill gas collected for destruction 
for the reporting year (cubic feet at 520 [deg]R or 60 degrees 
Fahrenheit and 1 atm).
    (2) Annual average CH<INF>4</INF> concentration of landfill gas 
collected for destruction (percent by volume).
    (3) Monthly average temperature and pressure for each month at which 
flow is measured for landfill gas collected for destruction, or 
statement that temperature and/or pressure is incorporated into internal 
calculations run by the monitoring equipment.
    (4) An indication as to whether flow was measured on a wet or dry 
basis, an indication as to whether CH<INF>4</INF> concentration was 
measured on a wet or dry basis, and if required for Equation HH-4 of 
this subpart, monthly average moisture content for each month at which 
flow is measured for landfill gas collected for destruction.
    (5) An indication of whether destruction occurs at the landfill 
facility or off-site. If destruction occurs at the landfill facility, 
also report an indication of whether a back-up destruction device is 
present at the landfill, the annual operating hours for the primary 
destruction device, the annual operating hours for the back-up 
destruction device (if present), and the destruction efficiency used 
(percent).
    (6) Annual quantity of recovered CH<INF>4</INF> (metric tons

this subpart, the estimated gas collection system efficiency for 
landfills with this gas collection system, the annual operating hours of 
the gas collection system, and an indication of whether passive vents 
and/or passive flares (vents or flares that are not considered part of 
the gas collection system as defined in Sec. 98.6) are present at the 
landfill.
    (8) Methane generation corrected for oxidation calculated using 
Equation HH-5 of this subpart, reported in metric tons CH<INF>4</INF>.
    (9) Methane generation (G<INF>CH4</INF>) value used as an input to

Sec. 98.348  Definitions.

    Except as specified in this section, all terms used in this subpart 
have the same meaning given in the Clean Air Act and subpart A of this 
part.
    Construction and demolition (C&D) waste landfill means a solid waste 
disposal facility subject to the requirements of part 257, subparts A or 
B of

[[Page 693]]

this chapter that receives construction and demolition waste and does 
not receive hazardous waste (defined in Sec. 261.3 of this chapter) or 
industrial solid waste (defined in Sec. 258.2 of this chapter) or 
municipal solid waste (as defined in Sec. 98.6) other than residential 
lead-based paint waste. A C&D waste landfill typically receives any one 
or more of the following types of solid wastes: Roadwork material, 
excavated material, demolition waste, construction/renovation waste, and 
site clearance waste.
    Destruction device means a flare, thermal oxidizer, boiler, turbine, 
internal combustion engine, or any other combustion unit used to destroy

solid waste landfill, a RCRA Subtitle C hazardous waste landfill, or a 
TSCA hazardous waste landfill, in which industrial solid waste, such a 
RCRA Subtitle D wastes (nonhazardous industrial solid waste, defined in 
Sec. 257.2 of this chapter), commercial solid wastes, or conditionally 
exempt small quantity generator wastes, is placed. An industrial waste 
landfill includes all disposal areas at the facility.
    Solid waste has the meaning established by the Administrator 
pursuant to the Solid Waste Disposal Act (42 U.S.C.A. 6901 et seq.).
    Working capacity means the maximum volume or mass of waste that is 
actually placed in the landfill from an individual or representative 
type of container (such as a tank, truck, or roll-off bin) used to

\a\ Recirculated leachate (in inches/year) is the total volume of leachate recirculated from company records or
  engineering estimates divided by the area of the portion of the landfill containing waste with appropriate

  Alternatively, landfills that use leachate recirculation can elect to use the greater value rather than
  calculating the recirculated leachate rate.
\c\ Use the lesser value when the potential evapotranspiration rate exceeds the mean annual precipitation rate
  plus recirculated leachate. Use the greater value when the potential evapotranspiration rate does not exceed
  the mean annual precipitation rate plus recirculated leachate. Alternatively, landfills that use leachate
  recirculation can elect to use the greater value rather than assessing the potential evapotranspiration rate
  or recirculated leachate rate.

    (2) Food processing.
    (3) Ethanol production.
    (4) Petroleum refining.
    (b) An anaerobic process is a procedure in which organic matter in 
wastewater, wastewater treatment sludge, or other material is degraded 
by micro organisms in the absence of oxygen, resulting in the generation 
of CO<INF>2</INF> and CH<INF>4.</INF> This source category consists of 
the following: anaerobic reactors, anaerobic lagoons, anaerobic sludge 
digesters, and biogas destruction devices (for example, burners, 
boilers, turbines, flares, or other devices).
    (1) An anaerobic reactor is an enclosed vessel used for anaerobic 
wastewater treatment (e.g., upflow anaerobic sludge blanket, fixed 
film).

moisture content of the biogas that is collected and routed to a 
destruction device according to the requirements in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) 
through (c)(2)(iii) of this section and calculate the quantity of 
CH<INF>4</INF> recovered for destruction using Equation II-4 of this

request to the Administrator to use one or more best available 
monitoring methods as listed in Sec. 98.3(d)(1)(i) through (iv). The 
request must be submitted no later than October 12, 2010 and must 
contain the information in Sec. 98.3(d)(2)(ii). To obtain approval, the 
request must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it is 
not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required 
piece of monitoring equipment by January 1, 2011. The use of best 
available monitoring methods will not be approved beyond December 31, 
2011.
    (b) You must determine the concentration of organic material in 
wastewater treated anaerobically using analytical methods for COD or 
BOD<INF>5</INF> specified in 40 CFR 136.3 Table 1B. For the purpose of 
determining concentrations of wastewater influent to the anaerobic 
wastewater treatment process, samples may be diluted to the 
concentration range of the approved method, but the calculated 
concentration of the undiluted wastewater must be used for calculations 
and reporting required by this subpart.
    (c) You must collect samples representing wastewater influent to the 
anaerobic wastewater treatment process, following all preliminary and 
primary treatment steps (e.g., after grit removal, primary 
clarification, oil-water separation, dissolved air flotation, or similar 
solids and oil separation processes). You must collect and analyze 
samples for COD or BOD<INF>5</INF> concentration once each calendar week 
that the anaerobic wastewater treatment process is operating, with at 
least three days between measurements. You must collect a sample that 
represents the average COD or BOD<INF>5</INF> concentration of the waste 
stream over a 24-hour sampling period. You must collect a minimum of 
four sample aliquots per 24-hour period and composite the aliquots for 
analysis. Collect a flow-proportional composite sample (either constant 
time interval between samples with sample volume proportional to stream 
flow, or constant sample volume with time interval between samples 
proportional to stream flow). Follow sampling procedures and techniques 
presented in Chapter 5, Sampling, of the ``NPDES Compliance Inspection 
Manual,'' (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 98.7) or Section 7.1.3, 
Sample Collection Methods, of the ``U.S. EPA NPDES Permit Writers' 
Manual,'' (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 98.7).
    (d) You must measure the flowrate of wastewater entering anaerobic 
wastewater treatment process once each calendar week that the process is 
operating, with at least three days between measurements. You must 
measure the flowrate for the 24-hour period for which you collect 
samples analyzed for COD or BOD<INF>5</INF> concentration. The flow 
measurement location must correspond to the location used to collect 
samples analyzed for COD or BOD<INF>5</INF> concentration. You must

Sec. 98.355  Procedures for estimating missing data.

    A complete record of all measured parameters used in the GHG 
emissions calculations is required. Therefore, whenever a quality-
assured value of a required parameter is unavailable (e.g., if a meter 
malfunctions during unit operation or if a required sample is not 
taken), a substitute data value for the missing parameter must be used 
in the calculations, according to the following requirements in 
paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section:

[[Page 702]]

    (a) For each missing weekly value of COD or BOD<INF>5</INF> or 
wastewater flow entering an anaerobic wastewater treatment process, the 
substitute data value must be the arithmetic average of the quality-
assured values of those parameters for the week immediately preceding 
and the week immediately following the missing data incident.
    (b) For each missing value of the CH<INF>4</INF> content or gas flow 
rates, the substitute data value must be the arithmetic average of the 
quality-assured values of that parameter immediately preceding and 
immediately following the missing data incident.
    (c) If, for a particular parameter, no quality-assured data are 
available prior to the missing data incident, the substitute data value 
must be the first quality-assured value obtained after the missing data 
period. If, for a particular parameter, the ``after'' value is not 
obtained by the end of the reporting year, you may use the last quality-
assured value obtained ``before'' the missing data period for the 
missing data substitution. You must document and keep records of the 
procedures you use for all such estimates.

                      Subpart JJ_Manure Management


<R05>
Sec. 98.360  Definition of the source category.

    (a) This source category consists of livestock facilities with 
manure management systems that emit 25,000 metric tons CO<INF>2</INF>e 
or more per year.
    (1) Table JJ-1 presents the minimum average annual animal population 
by animal group that is estimated to emit 25,000 metric tons 
CO<INF>2</INF>e or more per year. Facilities with an average annual 
animal population, as described in Sec. 98.363(a)(1) and (2), below 
those listed in Table JJ-1 do not need to report under this rule. A 
facility with an annual animal population that exceeds those listed in 
Table JJ-1 should conduct a more thorough analysis to determine 
applicability.
    (2) (i) If a facility has more than one animal group present (e.g., 
swine and poultry), the facility must determine if they are required to 
report by calculating the combined animal group factor (CAGF) using 
equation JJ-1:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR30OC09.137

Where:

CAGF = Combined Animal Group Factor
AAAP<INF>AG,Facility</INF> = Average annual animal population at the 
facility, by animal group
APTL <INF>AG</INF> = Animal population threshold level, as specified in 
Table JJ-1 of this section

    (ii) If the calculated CAGF for a facility is less than 1, the 
facility is not required to report under this rule. If the CAGF is equal 
to or greater than 1, the facility must use more detailed applicability 
tables and tools to determine if they are required to report under this 
rule.
    (b) A manure management system (MMS) is a system that stabilizes 
and/or stores livestock manure, litter, or manure wastewater in one or 
more of the following system components: Uncovered anaerobic lagoons, 
liquid/slurry systems with and without crust covers (including but not 
limited to ponds and tanks), storage pits, digesters, solid manure 
storage, dry lots (including feedlots), high-rise houses for poultry 
production (poultry without litter), poultry production with litter, 
deep bedding systems for cattle and swine, manure composting, and 
aerobic treatment.
    (c) This source category does not include system components at a 
livestock facility that are unrelated to the stabilization and/or 
storage of manure such as daily spread or pasture/range/paddock systems 
or land application activities or any method of manure utilization that 
is not listed in Sec. 98.360(b).
    (d) This source category does not include manure management 
activities located off site from a livestock facility or off-site manure 
composting operations.

    (5) Solid manure storage.
    (6) Dry lots, including feedlots.
    (7) High-rise houses for poultry production (poultry without litter)
    (8) Poultry production with litter.
    (9) Deep bedding systems for cattle and swine.
    (10) Manure composting.
    (11) Aerobic treatment.
    (b) A livestock facility that is subject to this rule only because 
of emissions from manure management system components is not required to 
report emissions from subparts C through PP (other than subpart JJ) of 
this part.
    (c) A livestock facility that is subject to this part because of 
emissions from source categories described in subparts C through PP of 
this part is not required to report emissions under subpart JJ of this 
part unless emissions from manure management systems are 25,000 metric 
tons CO<INF>2</INF>e per year or more.

equipment (temperature and pressure monitors) shall be maintained as 
specified by the manufacturer.
    (e) For digesters with gas collection systems, install, operate, 
maintain, and calibrate a gas flow meter capable of measuring the 
volumetric flow rate to provide data for the GHG emissions calculations, 
using the applicable methods specified in paragraphs (e)(1) through 
(e)(6) of this section or as specified by the manufacturer.

    (f) If applicable, the owner or operator shall document the 
procedures used to ensure the accuracy of gas flow rate, gas 
composition, temperature, and pressure measurements. These procedures 
include, but are not limited to, calibration of fuel flow meters and 
other measurement devices. The estimated accuracy of measurements made 
with these devices shall also be recorded, and the technical basis for 
these estimates shall be provided.
    (g) Each gas flow meter shall be calibrated prior to the first 
reporting year and recalibrated either annually or at the minimum 
frequency specified by the manufacturer, whichever is more frequent. 
Each gas flow meter must have a rated accuracy of <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>

Sec. 98.365  Procedures for estimating missing data.

    (a) A complete record of all measured parameters used in the GHG 
emissions calculations is required. Therefore, whenever a quality-
assured value of a required parameter is unavailable (e.g., if a meter 
malfunctions during unit operation or if a required fuel sample is not 
taken), a substitute data value for the missing parameter shall be used 
in the calculations, according to the requirements in paragraph (b) of 
this section.

[[Page 710]]

    (b) For missing gas flow rates or CH<INF>4</INF> content data, the 
substitute data value shall be the arithmetic average of the quality-
assured values of that parameter immediately preceding and immediately 
following the missing data incident. If, for a particular parameter, no 
quality-assured data are available prior to the missing data incident, 
the substitute data value shall be the first quality-assured value 
obtained after the missing data period.


<R05>

\1\ The threshold head populations in this table were calculated using
  the most conservative assumptions (high VS and N values, maximum
  ambient temperatures, and the application of an uncertainty factor) to
  ensure that facilities at or near the 25,000 metric ton CO2e threshold
  level were not excluded from reporting.
\2\ For facilities with more than one animal group present refer to Sec.
    98.360 (2) to estimate the combined animal group factor (CAGF),
  which is used to determine if a facility may be required to report.
\3\ For all animal groups except dairy, the average annual animal
  population represents the total number of animals present at the
  facility. For dairy facilities, the average annual animal population
  represents the number of mature dairy cows present at the facility
  (note that heifers and calves were included in the emission estimates
  for dairy facilities using the assumption that the average annual
  animal population of heifers and calves at dairy facilities are equal
  to 30 percent of the mature dairy cow average annual animal
  population, therefore the average annual population for dairy
  facilities should not include heifers and calves, only dairy cows).

<R05>
Sec. 98.394  Monitoring and QA/QC requirements.

    (a) Determination of quantity.
    (1) The quantity of petroleum products, natural gas liquids, and 
biomass, as well as the quantity of crude oil measured on site at a 
refinery, shall be determined as follows:
    (i) Where an appropriate standard method published by a consensus-
based standards organization exists, such a method shall be used. 
Consensus-based standards organizations include, but are not limited to, 
the following: ASTM International, the American National Standards 
Institute (ANSI), the American Gas Association (AGA), the

[[Page 724]]

American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the American Petroleum 
Institute (API), and the North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB).
    (ii) Where no appropriate standard method developed by a consensus-
based standards organization exists, industry standard practices shall 
be followed.
    (iii) For products that are liquid at 60 degrees Fahrenheit and one 
standard atmosphere, all measurements of quantity shall be temperature-
adjusted and pressure-adjusted to these conditions. For all other 
products, reporters shall use appropriate standard conditions specified 
in the standard method; if temperature and pressure conditions are not 
specified in the standard method or if a reporter uses an industry 
standard practice to determine quantity, the reporter shall use 
appropriate standard conditions according to established industry 
practices.
    (2) All measurement equipment (including, but not limited to, flow 
meters and tank gauges) used for compliance with this subpart shall be 
appropriate for the standard method or industry standard practice 
followed under paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (a)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (3) The quantity of crude oil not measured on site at a refinery 
shall be determined according to one of the following methods. You may 
use an appropriate standard method published by a consensus-based 
standards organization or you may use an industry standard practice.
    (b) Equipment Calibration.
    (1) All measurement equipment shall be calibrated prior to its first 
use for reporting under this subpart, using an appropriate standard 
method published by a consensus based standards organization or 
according to the equipment manufacturer's directions.
    (2) Measurement equipment shall be recalibrated at the minimum 
frequency specified by the standard method used or by the equipment 
manufacturer's directions.
    (c) Procedures for Calculation Methodology 2 of this subpart.
    (1) Reporting parties shall collect one sample of each petroleum 
product or natural gas liquid on any day of each calendar month of the 
reporting year in which the quantity of that product was measured in 
accordance with the requirements of this subpart. For example, if a 
given product was measured as entering the refinery continuously 
throughout the reporting year, twelve samples of that product shall be 
collected over the reporting year, one on any day of each calendar month 
of that year. If a given product was only measured from April 15 through 
June 10 of the reporting year, a refiner would collect three samples 
during that year, one during each of the calendar months of April, May 
and June on a day when the product was measured as either entering or 
exiting the refinery. Each sample shall be collected using an 
appropriate standard method published by a consensus-based standards 
organization.
    (2) Mixing and handling of samples shall be performed using an 
appropriate standard method published by a consensus-based standards 
organization.
    (3) Density measurement.
    (i) For all products that are not solid, reporters shall test for 
density using an appropriate standard method published by a consensus-
based standards organization.
    (ii) The density value for a given petroleum product shall be 
generated by either making a physical composite of all of the samples 
collected for the reporting year and testing that single sample or by 
measuring the individual samples throughout the year and defining the 
representative density value for the sample set by numerical means, 
i.e., a mathematical composite. If a physical composite is chosen as the 
option to obtain the density value, the reporter shall submit each of 
the individual samples collected during the reporting year to the 
laboratory responsible for generating the composite sample.
    (iii) For physical composites, the reporter shall handle the 
individual samples and the laboratory shall mix them in accordance with 
an appropriate standard method published by a consensus-based standards 
organization.
    (iv) All measurements of density shall be temperature-adjusted and 
pressure-adjusted to the conditions assumed for determining the 
quantities

[[Page 725]]

of the product reported under this subpart.
    (4) Carbon share measurement.
    (i) Reporters shall test for carbon share using an appropriate 
standard method published by a consensus-based standards organization.
    (ii) If a standard method that involves gas chromatography is used 
to determine the percent mass of each component in a product, the 
molecular formula for each component shall be obtained from the 
information provided in the standard method and the atomic mass of each 
element in a given molecular component shall be obtained from the 
periodic table of the elements.
    (iii) The carbon share value for a given petroleum product shall be 
generated by either making a physical composite of all of the samples 
collected for the reporting year and testing that single sample or by 
measuring the individual samples throughout the year and defining the 
representative carbon share value for the sample set by numerical means, 
i.e., a mathematical composite. If a physical composite is chosen as the 
option to obtain the carbon share value, the reporter shall submit each 
of the individual samples collected during the reporting year to the 
laboratory responsible for generating the composite sample.
    (iv) For physical composites, the reporter shall handle the 
individual samples and the laboratory shall mix them in accordance with 
an appropriate standard method published by a consensus-based standards 
organization.
    (d) Measurement of API gravity and sulfur content of crude oil.
    (1) A representative sample or multiple representative samples of 
each batch of crude oil shall be taken according to one of the following 
methods. You may use an appropriate standard method published by a 
consensus-based standards organization or you may use an industry 
standard practice.
    (2) Samples shall be handled according to one of the following 
methods. You may use an appropriate standard method published by a 
consensus-based standards organization or you may use an industry 
standard practice.
    (3) API gravity shall be measured according to one of the following 
methods. You may use an appropriate standard method published by a 
consensus-based standards organization or you may use an industry 
standard practice. The weighted average API gravity for each batch shall 
be calculated by multiplying the volume associated with each 
representative sample by the API gravity, adding these values for all 
the samples, and then dividing that total value by the volume of the 
batch.
    (4) Sulfur content shall be measured according to one of the 
following methods. You may use an appropriate standard method published 
by a consensus-based standards organization or you may use an industry 
standard practice. The weighted average sulfur content for each batch 
shall be calculated by multiplying the volume associated with each 
representative sample by the sulfur content, adding these values for all

Sec. 98.395  Procedures for estimating missing data.

    (a) Determination of quantity. Whenever the quality assurance 
procedures in Sec. 98.394(a) cannot be followed to measure the quantity 
of one or more petroleum products, natural gas liquids, types of 
biomass, feedstocks, or crude oil batches during any period (e.g., if a 
meter malfunctions), the following missing data procedures shall be 
used:
    (1) For quantities of a product that are purchased or sold, a period 
of missing data shall be substituted using a reporter's established 
procedures for billing purposes in that period as agreed to by the party 
selling or purchasing the product.
    (2) For quantities of a product that are not purchased or sold but 
of which the custody is transferred, a period of missing data shall be 
substituted using a reporter's established procedures for tracking 
purposes in that period as agreed to by the party involved in custody 
transfer of the product.

[[Page 726]]

    (b) Determination of emission factor. Whenever any of the procedures 
in Sec. 98.394(c) cannot be followed to develop an emission factor for 
any reason, Calculation Methodology 1 of this subpart must be used in 
place of Calculation Methodology 2 of this subpart for the entire 
reporting year.
    (c) Determination of API gravity and sulfur content of crude oil. 
For missing data on sulfur content or API gravity, the substitute data 
value shall be the arithmetic average of the quality-assured values of 
API gravity or sulfur content in the batch preceding and the batch 
immediately following the missing data incident. If no quality-assured 
data are available prior to the missing data incident, the substitute 
data value shall be the first quality-assured values for API gravity and 
sulfur content obtained from the batch after the missing data period.

       Subpart NN_Suppliers of Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids


<R05>
Sec. 98.400  Definition of the source category.

    This supplier category consists of natural gas liquids fractionators 
and local natural gas distribution companies.
    (a) Natural gas liquids fractionators are installations that 
fractionate natural gas liquids (NGLs) into their consitutent liquid 
products (ethane, propane, normal butane, isobutane or pentanes plus) 
for supply to downstream facilities.
    (b) Local Distribution Companies (LDCs) are companies that own or 
operate distribution pipelines, not interstate pipelines or intrastate 
pipelines, that physically deliver natural gas to end users and that are 
regulated as separate operating companies by State public utility 
commissions or that operate as independent municipally-owned 
distribution systems.
    (c) This supply category does not consist of the following 
facilities:
    (1) Field gathering and boosting stations.
    (2) Natural gas processing plants that separate NGLs from natural 
gas and produce bulk or y-grade NGLs but do not fractionate these NGLs 
into their constituent products.
    (3) Facilities that meet the definition of refineries and report 
under subpart MM of this part.
    (4) Facilities that meet the definition of petrochemical plants and 
report under subpart X of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 98.401  Reporting threshold.

    Any supplier of natural gas and natural gas liquids that meets the 
requirements of Sec. 98.2(a)(4) must report GHG emissions.


<R05>
Sec. 98.402  GHGs to report.

    (a) NGL fractionators must report the CO<INF>2</INF> emissions that 
would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of the annual 
quantity of ethane, propane, normal butane, isobutane, and pentanes plus 
that is produced and sold or delivered to others.
    (b) LDCs must report the CO<INF>2</INF> emissions that would result 
from the complete combustion or oxidation of the annual volumes of 
natural gas provided to end-users on their distribution systems.


<R05>
Sec. 98.403  Calculating GHG emissions.

    (a) LDCs and fractionators shall, for each individual product 
reported under this part, calculate the estimated CO<INF>2</INF> 
emissions that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of 
the products supplied using either of Calculation Methodology 1 or 2 of 
this subpart:
    (1) Calculation Methodology 1. NGL fractionators shall estimate 
CO<INF>2</INF> emissions that would result from the complete combustion 
or oxidation of the product(s) supplied using Equation NN-1 of this 
section. LDCs shall estimate CO<INF>2</INF> emissions that would result 
from the complete combustion or oxidation of the product received at the 
city gate using Equation NN-1. For each product, use the default value 
for higher heating value and CO<INF>2</INF> emission factor in Table NN-
1 of this subpart. Alternatively, for each product, a reporter-specific 
higher heating value and CO<INF>2</INF> emission factor may be used, in 
place of one or both defaults provided they are developed using methods 
outlined in Sec. 98.404. For each product, you must use the same volume 
unit throughout the equation.

shall be the measurements taken at custody transfers summed to the 
annual reportable volume.
    (ii) For natural gas the minimum frequency of measurement shall be 
based on the LDC's standard measurement schedules used for billing 
purposes and summed to the annual reportable volume.
    (3) NGL fractionators shall use measurement for NGLs at custody 
tranfer meters or at such meters that are used to determine the NGL 
product slate delivered from the fractionation facility.
    (4) If a NGL fractionator supplies a product not listed in Table NN-
1 of this subpart that is a mixture or blend of two or more products 
listed in Tables NN-1 and NN-2 of this subpart, the NGL fractionator 
shall report the quantities of the constituents of the mixtures or 
blends separately.
    (5) For an LDC using Equation NN-1 or NN-2 of this subpart, the

according to established business practices, it shall use its delivering 
pipeline invoiced measurements for natural gas deliveries to the LDC 
city gate, used in determining daily system sendout.
    (6) An LDC using Equation NN-3 of this subpart shall measure natural 
gas at the custody transfer meters.
    (7) An LDC using Equation NN-4 of this subpart shall measure natural 
gas at the customer meters. The reporter shall consider the volume 
delivered through a single particluar meter at a single particular 
location as the volume delivered to an individual end-user.
    (8) An LDC using Equation NN-5 of this subpart shall measure natural 
gas as follows:
    (i) Fuel<INF>1</INF> shall be measured at the on-system storage 
injection meters and/or at the meters measuring natural gas to be 
liquefied.
    (ii) Fuel<INF>2</INF> shall be measured at the meters used for 
measuring on-system storage withdrawals and/or LNG vaporization 
injection. If Fuel<INF>2</INF> is from a source other than storage, the 
appropriate meter shall be used to measure the quantity.
    (9) An LDC shall measure all natural gas under the following 
standard industry temperature and pressure conditions: Cubic foot of gas 
at a temperature of 60 degrees Fahrenheit and at an

[[Page 736]]

absolute pressure of fourteen and seventy-three hundredths (14.73) 
pounds per square inch.
    (b) Determination of higher heating values (HHV).
    (1) When a reporter uses the default HHV provided in this section to 
calculate Equation NN-1 of this subpart, the appropriate value shall be 
taken from Table NN-1 of this subpart.

Equation NN-1 of this subpart, an appropriate standard test published by 
a consensus-based standards organization shall be used. Consensus-based 
standards organizations include, but are not limited to, the following: 
AGA and GPA.
    (i) If an LDC makes its own HHV measurements according to 
established business practices, then its own measurements shall be used.
    (ii) If an LDC does not make its own measurements according to 
established business practices, it shall use its delivering pipeline 
measurements.
    (c) Determination of emission factor (EF).
    (1) When a reporter used the default EF provided in this section to 
calculate Equation NN-1 of this subpart, the appropriate value shall be 
taken from Table NN-1 of this subpart.
    (2) When a reporter used the default EF provided in this section to 
calculate Equation NN-2, NN-3, NN-4, NN-5, or NN-7 of this subpart, the 
appropriate value shall be taken from Table NN-2 of this subpart.
    (3) When a reporter uses a reporter-specific EF, the reporter shall 
use an appropriate standard method published by a consensus-based 
standards organization to conduct compositional analysis necessary to 
determine reporter-specific CO<INF>2</INF> emission factors. Consensus-
based standards organizations include, but are not limited to, the 
following: AGA and GPA.
    (d) Equipment Calibration.
    (1) Equipment used to measure quantities in Equations NN-1, NN-2,

<R05>
Sec. 98.405  Procedures for estimating missing data.

    (a) Whenever a quality-assured value of the quantity of natural gas 
liquids or natural gas supplied during any period is unavailable (e.g., 
if a flow meter malfunctions), a substitute data value for the missing 
quantity measurement must be used in the calculations according to 
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
    (b) Determination of quantity.
    (1) NGL fractionators shall substitute meter records provided by 
pipeline(s) for all pipeline receipts of NGLs; by manifests for 
deliveries made to trucks or rail cars; or metered quantities accepted 
by the entities purchasing the output from the fractionator whether by 
pipeline or by truck or rail car. In cases where the metered data from 
the receiving pipeline(s) or purchasing entities are not available, 
fractionators may substitute estimates based on contract quantities 
required to be delivered under purchase or delivery contracts with other 
parties.
    (2) LDCs shall either substitute their delivering pipeline metered 
deliveries at the city gate or substitute nominations and scheduled 
delivery quantities for the period when metered values of actual 
deliveries are not available.
    (c) Determination of HHV and EF.
    (1) Whenever an LDC that makes its own HHV measurements according to 
established business practices cannot follow the quality assurance 
procedures for developing a reporter-specific HHV, as specified in Sec. 
98.404, during any period for any reason, the reporter shall use either 
its delivering pipeline measurements or the default HHV provided in 
Table NN-1 of this part for that period.
    (2) Whenever an LDC that does not make its own HHV measurements 
according to established business practices or an NGL fractionator 
cannot follow the quality assurance procedures for developing a 
reporter-specific

[[Page 737]]

HHV, as specified in Sec. 98.404, during any period for any reason, the 
reporter shall use the default HHV provided in Table NN-1 of this part 
for that period.
    (3) Whenever a NGL fractionator cannot follow the quality assurance 
procedures for developing a reporter-specific HHV, as specified in Sec. 
98.404, during any period for any reason, the NGL fractionator shall use 
the default HHV provided in Table NN-1 of this part for that period.
    (4) Whenever a reporter cannot follow the quality assurance 
procedures for developing a reporter-specific EF, as specified in Sec. 
98.404, during any period for any reason, the reporter shall use the 
default EF provided in Sec. 98.408 for that period.

<R04>
           Subpart OO_Suppliers of Industrial Greenhouse Gases


<R05>
Sec. 98.410  Definition of the source category.

    (a) The industrial gas supplier source category consists of any 
facility that produces a fluorinated GHG or nitrous oxide, any bulk 
importer of fluorinated GHGs or nitrous oxide, and any bulk exporter of 
fluorinated GHGs or nitrous oxide.
    (b) To produce a fluorinated GHG means to manufacture a fluorinated 
GHG from any raw material or feedstock chemical. Producing a fluorinated 
GHG includes the manufacture of a fluorinated GHG as an isolated 
intermediate for use in a process that will result in its transformation 
either at or outside of the production facility. Producing a fluorinated 
GHG also includes the creation of a fluorinated GHG (with the exception 
of HFC-23) that is captured and shipped off site for any reason, 
including destruction. Producing a fluorinated GHG does not include the 
reuse or recycling of a fluorinated GHG, the creation of HFC-23 during 
the production of HCFC-22, the creation of intermediates that are 
created and transformed in a single process with no storage of the 
intermediates, or the creation of fluorinated GHGs that are released or 
destroyed at the production facility before the production measurement 
at Sec. 98.414(a).
    (c) To produce nitrous oxide means to produce nitrous oxide by 
thermally decomposing ammonium nitrate (NH<INF>4</INF>NO<INF>3</INF>). 
Producing nitrous oxide does not include the reuse or recycling of 
nitrous oxide or the creation of by-products that are released or 
destroyed at the production facility.

[74 FR 56374, Oct. 30, 2009, as amended at 75 FR 79167, Dec. 17, 2010]


<R05>
Sec. 98.411  Reporting threshold.

    Any supplier of industrial greenhouse gases who meets the 
requirements of Sec. 98.2(a)(4) must report GHG emissions.


<R05>
Sec. 98.412  GHGs to report.

    You must report the GHG emissions that would result from the release 
of the nitrous oxide and each fluorinated GHG that you produce, import, 
export, transform, or destroy during the calendar year.


<R05>
Sec. 98.413  Calculating GHG emissions.

    (a) Calculate the total mass of each fluorinated GHG or nitrous 
oxide produced annually, except for amounts that are captured solely to 
be shipped off site for destruction, by using Equation OO-1 of this 
section: 
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR30OC09.171

P = Mass of fluorinated GHG or nitrous oxide produced annually.
P<INF>p</INF> = Mass of fluorinated GHG or nitrous oxide produced over 
the period ``p''.

    (b) Calculate the total mass of each fluorinated GHG or nitrous 
oxide produced over the period ``p'' by using Equation OO-2 of this 
section:

[[Page 740]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR30OC09.172

Where:

P<INF>p</INF> = Mass of fluorinated GHG or nitrous oxide produced over 
the period ``p'' (metric tons).
O<INF>p</INF> = Mass of fluorinated GHG or nitrous oxide that is 
measured coming out of the production process over the period p (metric 
tons).
U<INF>p</INF> = Mass of used fluorinated GHG or nitrous oxide that is 
added to the production process upstream of the output measurement over 
the period ``p'' (metric tons).

    (c) Calculate the total mass of each fluorinated GHG or nitrous 
oxide transformed by using Equation OO-3 of this section: 
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR30OC09.173

Where:

T = Mass of fluorinated GHG or nitrous oxide transformed annually 
(metric tons).

F<INF>T</INF> = Mass of fluorinated GHG fed into the transformation 
    process annually (metric tons).
E<INF>T</INF> = The fraction of the fluorinated GHG or nitrous oxide fed 
    into the transformation process that is transformed in the process 
    (metric tons).

    (d) Calculate the total mass of each fluorinated GHG destroyed by 
using Equation OO-4 of this section:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR30OC09.174

Where:

D = Mass of fluorinated GHG destroyed annually (metric tons).
F<INF>D</INF> = Mass of fluorinated GHG fed into the destruction device 
annually (metric tons).
DE = Destruction efficiency of the destruction device (fraction).


<R05>
Sec. 98.414  Monitoring and QA/QC requirements.

    (a) The mass of fluorinated GHGs or nitrous oxide coming out of the 
production process shall be measured using flowmeters, weigh scales, or 
a combination of volumetric and density measurements with an accuracy 
and precision of one percent of full scale or better. If the measured 
mass includes more than one fluorinated GHG, the concentrations of each 
of the fluorinated GHGs, other than low-concentration constituents, 
shall be measured as set forth in paragraph (n) of this section. For 
each fluorinated GHG, the mean of the concentrations of that fluorinated 
GHG (mass fraction) measured under paragraph (n) of this section shall 
be multiplied by the mass measurement to obtain the mass of that 
fluorinated GHG coming out of the production process.
    (b) The mass of any used fluorinated GHGs or used nitrous oxide 
added back into the production process upstream of the output 
measurement in paragraph (a) of this section shall be measured using 
flowmeters, weigh scales, or a combination of volumetric and density 
measurements with an accuracy and precision of one percent of full scale 
or better. If the mass in paragraph (a) of this section is measured by 
weighing containers that include returned heels as well as newly 
produced fluorinated GHGs, the returned heels shall be considered used 
fluorinated GHGs for purposes of this paragraph (b) of this section and 
Sec. 98.413(b).
    (c) The mass of fluorinated GHGs or nitrous oxide fed into the 
transformation process shall be measured using flowmeters, weigh scales, 
or a combination of volumetric and density measurements with an accuracy 
and precision of one percent of full scale or better.
    (d) The fraction of the fluorinated GHGs or nitrous oxide fed into 
the transformation process that is actually transformed shall be 
estimated considering yield calculations or quantities of unreacted 
fluorinated GHGs or nitrous oxide permanently removed from the process 
and recovered, destroyed, or emitted.
    (e) The mass of fluorinated GHG or nitrous oxide sent to another 
facility for transformation shall be measured using flowmeters, weigh 
scales, or a combination of volumetric and density measurements with an 
accuracy and precision of one percent of full scale or better.
    (f) The mass of fluorinated GHG sent to another facility for 
destruction shall be measured using flowmeters, weigh scales, or a 
combination of volumetric and density measurements with an accuracy and 
precision of one percent of full scale or better. If the measured mass 
includes more than trace concentrations of materials other than the

[[Page 741]]

fluorinated GHG, the concentration of the fluorinated GHG shall be 
estimated considering current or previous representative concentration 
measurements and other relevant process information. This concentration 
(mass fraction) shall be multiplied by the mass measurement to obtain 
the mass of the fluorinated GHG sent to another facility for 
destruction.
    (g) You must estimate the share of the mass of fluorinated GHGs in 
paragraph (f) of this section that is comprised of fluorinated GHGs that 
are not included in the mass produced in Sec. 98.413(a) because they 
are removed from the production process as by-products or other wastes.
    (h) You must measure the mass of each fluorinated GHG that is fed 
into the destruction device and that was previously produced as defined 
at Sec. 98.410(b). Such fluorinated GHGs include but are not limited to 
quantities that are shipped to the facility by another facility for 
destruction and quantities that are returned to the facility for 
reclamation but are found to be irretrievably contaminated and are 
therefore destroyed. You must use flowmeters, weigh scales, or a 
combination of volumetric and density measurements with an accuracy and 
precision of one percent of full scale or better. If the measured mass 
includes more than trace concentrations of materials other than the 
fluorinated GHG being destroyed, you must estimate the concentrations of 
the fluorinated GHG being destroyed considering current or previous 
representative concentration measurements and other relevant process 
information. You must multiply this concentration (mass fraction) by the 
mass measurement to obtain the mass of the fluorinated GHG fed into the 
destruction device.
    (i) Very small quantities of fluorinated GHGs that are difficult to 
measure because they are entrained in other media such as destroyed 
filters and destroyed sample containers are exempt from paragraphs (f) 
and (h) of this section.
    (j) [Reserved]
    (k) For purposes of Equation OO-4 of this subpart, the destruction 
efficiency can be equated to the destruction efficiency determined 
during a previous performance test of the destruction device or, if no 
performance test has been done, the destruction efficiency provided by 
the manufacturer of the destruction device.
    (l) In their estimates of the mass of fluorinated GHGs destroyed, 
fluorinated GHG production facilities that destroy fluorinated GHGs 
shall account for any temporary reductions in the destruction efficiency 
that result from any startups, shutdowns, or malfunctions of the 
destruction device, including departures from the operating conditions 
defined in state or local permitting requirements and/or oxidizer 
manufacturer specifications.
    (m) Calibrate all flow meters, weigh scales, and combinations of 
volumetric and density measures that are used to measure or calculate 
quantities that are to be reported under this subpart prior to the first 
year for which GHG emissions are reported under this part. Calibrations 
performed prior to the effective date of this rule satisfy this 
requirement. Recalibrate all flow meters, weigh scales, and combinations 
of volumetric and density measures at the minimum frequency specified by 
the manufacturer. Use NIST-traceable standards and suitable methods 
published by a consensus standards organization (e.g., ASTM, ASME, ISO, 
or others).
    (n) If the mass coming out of the production process includes more 
than one fluorinated GHG, you shall measure the concentrations of all of 
the fluorinated GHGs, other than low-concentration constituents, as 
follows:
    (1) Analytical Methods. Use a quality-assured analytical measurement 
technology capable of detecting the analyte of interest at the 
concentration of interest and use a procedure validated with the analyte 
of interest at the concentration of interest. Where standards for the 
analyte are not available, a chemically similar surrogate may be used. 
Acceptable analytical measurement technologies include but are not 
limited to gas chromatography (GC) with an appropriate detector, 
infrared (IR), fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and nuclear magnetic 
resonance (NMR). Acceptable methods include EPA Method 18 in appendix A-
1 of 40

[[Page 742]]

CFR part 60; EPA Method 320 in appendix A of 40 CFR part 63; the 
Protocol for Measuring Destruction or Removal Efficiency (DRE) of 
Fluorinated Greenhouse Gas Abatement Equipment in Electronics 
Manufacturing, Version 1, EPA-430-R-10-003, (March 2010) (incorporated 
by reference, see Sec. 98.7); ASTM D6348-03 Standard Test Method for 
Determination of Gaseous Compounds by Extractive Direct Interface 
Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy (incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 98.7); or other analytical methods validated using 
EPA Method 301 in appendix A of 40 CFR part 63 or some other 
scientifically sound validation protocol. The validation protocol may 
include analytical technology manufacturer specifications or 
recommendations.
    (2) Documentation in GHG Monitoring Plan. Describe the analytical 
method(s) used under paragraph (n)(1) of this section in the site GHG 
Monitoring Plan as required under Sec. 98.3(g)(5). At a minimum, 
include in the description of the method a description of the analytical 
measurement equipment and procedures, quantitative estimates of the 
method's accuracy and precision for the analytes of interest at the 
concentrations of interest, as well as a description of how these 
accuracies and precisions were estimated, including the validation 
protocol used.
    (3) Frequency of measurement. Perform the measurements at least once 
by February 15, 2011 if the fluorinated GHG product is being produced on 
December 17, 2010. Perform the measurements within 60 days of commencing 
production of any fluorinated GHG product that was not being produced on 
December 17, 2010. Repeat the measurements if an operational or process 
change occurs that could change the identities or significantly change 
the concentrations of the fluorinated GHG constituents of the 
fluorinated GHG product. Complete the repeat measurements within 60 days 
of the operational or process change.
    (4) Measure all product grades. Where a fluorinated GHG is produced 
at more than one purity level (e.g., pharmaceutical grade and 
refrigerant grade), perform the measurements for each purity level.
    (5) Number of samples. Analyze a minimum of three samples of the 
fluorinated GHG product that have been drawn under conditions that are 
representative of the process producing the fluorinated GHG product. If 
the relative standard deviation of the measured concentrations of any of 
the fluorinated GHG constituents (other than low-concentration 
constituents) is greater than or equal to 15 percent, draw and analyze 
enough additional samples to achieve a total of at least six samples of 
the fluorinated GHG product.
    (o) All analytical equipment used to determine the concentration of 
fluorinated GHGs, including but not limited to gas chromatographs and 
associated detectors, IR, FTIR and NMR devices, shall be calibrated at a 
frequency needed to support the type of analysis specified in the site 
GHG Monitoring Plan as required under Sec. Sec. 98.414(n) and 
98.3(g)(5) of this part. Quality assurance samples at the concentrations 
of concern shall be used for the calibration. Such quality assurance 
samples shall consist of or be prepared from certified standards of the 
analytes of concern where available; if not available, calibration shall 
be performed by a method specified in the GHG Monitoring Plan.
    (p) Isolated intermediates that are produced and transformed at the 
same facility are exempt from the monitoring requirements of this 
section.
    (q) Low-concentration constituents are exempt from the monitoring 
and QA/QC requirements of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 98.415  Procedures for estimating missing data.

    (a) A complete record of all measured parameters used in the GHG 
emissions calculations is required. Therefore, whenever a quality-
assured value of a required parameter is unavailable (e.g., if a meter 
malfunctions), a substitute data value for the missing parameter shall 
be used in the calculations, according to paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) For each missing value of the mass produced, fed into the 
production

[[Page 743]]

process (for used material being reclaimed), fed into the transformation 
process, fed into destruction devices, sent to another facility for 
transformation, or sent to another facility for destruction, the 
substitute value of that parameter shall be a secondary mass measurement 
where such a measurement is available. For example, if the mass produced 
is usually measured with a flowmeter at the inlet to the day tank and 
that flowmeter fails to meet an accuracy or precision test, 
malfunctions, or is rendered inoperable, then the mass produced may be 
estimated by calculating the change in volume in the day tank and 
multiplying it by the density of the product. Where a secondary mass 
measurement is not available, the substitute value of the parameter 
shall be an estimate based on a related parameter. For example, if a 
flowmeter measuring the mass fed into a destruction device is rendered 
inoperable, then the mass fed into the destruction device may be 
estimated using the production rate and the previously observed 
relationship between the production rate and the mass flow rate into the 
destruction device.

methods used to record mass of fluorinated GHG destroyed, then a revised 
report must be submitted to reflect the changes. The revised report must 
be submitted to EPA within 60 days of the change.
    (c) Each bulk importer of fluorinated GHGs or nitrous oxide shall

Sec. 98.418  Definitions.

    Except as provided below, all of the terms used in this subpart have 
the same meaning given in the Clean Air Act and subpart A of this part. 
If a conflict exists between a definition provided in this subpart and a 
definition provided in subpart A, the definition in this subpart shall 
take precedence for the reporting requirements in this subpart.
    Isolated intermediate means a product of a process that is stored 
before subsequent processing. An isolated intermediate is usually a 
product of chemical synthesis. Storage of an isolated intermediate marks 
the end of a process. Storage occurs at any time the intermediate is 
placed in equipment used solely for storage.
    Low-concentration constituent means, for purposes of fluorinated GHG 
production and export, a fluorinated GHG constituent of a fluorinated 
GHG product that occurs in the product in concentrations below 0.1 
percent by mass. For purposes of fluorinated GHG import, low-
concentration constituent means a fluorinated GHG constituent of a 
fluorinated GHG product that occurs in the product in concentrations 
below 0.5 percent by mass. Low-concentration constituents do not include 
fluorinated GHGs that are deliberately combined with the product (e.g., 
to affect the performance characteristics of the product).

flow monitoring and reporting provisions in your Underground Injection 
Control permit.
    (2) You must measure flow rate of CO<INF>2</INF> injected with a 
flow meter and collect the flow rate quarterly.
    (3) You must sample the injected CO<INF>2</INF> stream at least once 
per quarter immediately upstream or downstream of the flow meter used to

verification (MRV) plan.

    (a) Contents of MRV plan. You must develop and submit to the 
Administrator a proposed MRV plan for monitoring, reporting, and 
verification of geologic sequestration at your facility. Your proposed 
MRV plan must contain the following components:
    (1) Delineation of the maximum monitoring area and the active 
monitoring areas. The first period for your active monitoring area will 
begin from the date determined in your MRV plan through the date at 
which the plan calls for the first expansion of the monitoring area. The 
length of each monitoring period can be any time interval chosen by you 
that is greater than 1 year.
    (2) Identification of potential surface leakage pathways for 
CO<INF>2</INF> in the maximum monitoring area and the likelihood, 
magnitude, and timing, of surface leakage of CO<INF>2</INF> through 
these pathways.
    (3) A strategy for detecting and quantifying any surface leakage of 
CO<INF>2</INF>.
    (4) A strategy for establishing the expected baselines for 
monitoring CO<INF>2</INF> surface leakage.
    (5) A summary of the considerations you intend to use to calculate 
site-specific variables for the mass balance equation. This includes, 
but is not limited to, considerations for calculating equipment leakage 
and vented emissions between the injection flow meter and injection well 
and/or the production flow meter and production well, and considerations 
for calculating CO<INF>2</INF> in produced fluids.
    (6) If a well is permitted under the Underground Injection Control 
program, for each injection well, report the well identification number 
used for the Underground Injection Control permit and the Underground 
Injection Control permit class. If the well is not yet permitted, and 
you have applied for an Underground Injection Control permit, report the 
well identification numbers in the permit application. If an offshore 
well is not subject to the Safe Drinking Water Act, for each injection 
well, report any well identification number and any identification 
number used for the legal instrument

[[Page 769]]

authorizing geologic sequestration. If you are submitting your 
Underground Injection Control permit application as part of your 
proposed MRV plan, you must notify EPA when the permit has been 
approved. If you are an offshore facility not subject to the Safe 
Drinking Water Act, and are submitting your application for the legal 
instrument authorizing geologic sequestration as part of your proposed 
MRV plan, you must notify EPA when the legal instrument authorizing 
geologic sequestration has been approved.
    (7) Proposed date to begin collecting data for calculating total 
amount sequestered according to equation RR-11 or RR-12 of this subpart. 
This date must be after expected baselines as required by paragraph 
(a)(4) of this section are established and the leakage detection and 
quantification strategy as required by paragraph (a)(3) of this section 
is implemented in the initial AMA.
    (b) Timing. You must submit a proposed MRV plan to EPA according to 
the following schedule:
    (1) You must submit a proposed MRV plan to EPA by June 30, 2011 if 
you were issued a final Underground Injection Control permit authorizing 
the injection of CO<INF>2</INF> into the subsurface on or before 
December 31, 2010. You will be allowed to request one extension of up to 
an additional 180 days in which to submit your proposed MRV plan.
    (2) You must submit a proposed MRV plan to EPA within 180 days of 
receiving a final Underground Injection Control permit authorizing the 
injection of CO<INF>2</INF> into the subsurface. If your facility is an 
offshore facility not subject to the Safe Drinking Water Act, you must 
submit a proposed MRV plan to EPA within 180 days of receiving 
authorization to begin geologic sequestration of CO<INF>2</INF>. You 
will be allowed to request one extension of the submittal date of up to 
an additional 180 days.
    (3) If you are injecting a CO<INF>2</INF> stream in subsurface 
geologic formations to enhance the recovery of oil or natural gas and 
you are not permitted as Class VI under the Underground Injection 
Control program, you may opt to submit an MRV plan at any time.
    (4) If EPA determines that your proposed MRV plan is incomplete, you 
must submit an updated MRV plan within 45 days of EPA notification, 
unless otherwise specified by EPA.
    (c) Final MRV plan. The Administrator will issue a final MRV plan 
within a reasonable period of time. The Administrator's final MRV plan 
is subject to the provisions of part 78 of this chapter. Once the MRV 
plan is final and no longer subject to administrative appeal under part 
78 of this chapter, you must implement the plan starting on the day 
after the day on which the plan becomes final and is no longer subject 
to such appeal.
    (d) MRV plan revisions. You must revise and submit the MRV plan 
within 180 days to the Administrator for approval if any of the 
following in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(4) of this section applies. 
You must include the reason(s) for the revisions in your submittal.
    (1) A material change was made to monitoring and/or operational 
parameters that was not anticipated in the original MRV plan. Examples 
of material changes include but are not limited to: Large changes in the 
volume of CO<INF>2</INF> injected; the construction of new injection 
wells not identified in the MRV plan; failures of the monitoring system 
including monitoring system sensitivity, performance, location, or 
baseline; changes to surface land use that affects baseline or 
operational conditions; observed plume location that differs 
significantly from the predicted plume area used for developing the MRV 
plan; a change in the maximum monitoring area or active monitoring area; 
or a change in monitoring technology that would result in coverage or 
detection capability different from the MRV plan.
    (2) A change in the permit class of your Underground Injection 
Control permit.
    (3) If you are notified by EPA of substantive errors in your MRV 
plan or monitoring report.
    (4) You choose to revise your MRV plan for any other reason in any

CO<INF>2</INF> injection tests conducted as a precursor to long-term 
storage.
    Separator means a vessel in which streams of multiple phases are 
gravity separated into individual streams of single phase.

<R05>
Sec. 98.450  Definition of the source category.

    The electrical equipment manufacturing or refurbishment category 
consists of processes that manufacture or refurbish gas-insulated 
substations, circuit breakers, other switchgear, gas-insulated lines, or 
power transformers (including gas-containing components of such 
equipment) containing sulfur-hexafluoride (SF<INF>6</INF>) or 
perfluorocarbons (PFCs). The processes include equipment testing, 
installation, manufacturing, decommissioning and disposal, refurbishing, 
and storage in gas cylinders and other containers.


<R05>
Sec. 98.451  Reporting threshold.

    You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility 
contains an electrical equipment manufacturing or refurbishing process 
and the facility meets the requirements of Sec. 98.2(a)(1). Electrical 
equipment manufacturing and refurbishing facilities covered by this rule 
are those that have total annual purchases of SF<INF>6</INF> and PFCs 
that exceed 23,000 pounds.


<R05>
Sec. 98.452  GHGs to report.

    (a) You must report SF<INF>6</INF> and PFC emissions at the facility 
level. Annual emissions from the facility must include SF<INF>6</INF> 
and PFC emissions from equipment that is installed at an off-site 
electric power transmission or distribution location whenever emissions 
from installation activities (e.g., filling) occur before the title to 
the equipment is transferred to the electric power transmission or 
distribution entity.
    (b) You must report CO<INF>2</INF>, N<INF>2</INF>O and 
CH<INF>4</INF> emissions from each stationary combustion unit. You must 
calculate and report these emissions under subpart C of this part 
(General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources) by following the 
requirements of subpart C of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 98.453  Calculating GHG emissions.

    (a) For each electrical equipment manufacturer or refurbisher, 
estimate the annual SF<INF>6</INF> and PFC emissions using the mass-
balance approach in Equation SS-1 of this section:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR01DE10.056

Where:

Decrease in SF<INF>6</INF> Inventory = (Pounds of SF<INF>6</INF> stored 
          in containers at the beginning of the year)--(Pounds of 
          SF<INF>6</INF> stored in containers at the end of the year).
Acquisitions of SF<INF>6</INF> = (Pounds of SF<INF>6</INF> purchased 
          from chemical producers or suppliers in bulk) + (Pounds of 
          SF<INF>6</INF> returned by equipment users) + (Pounds of 
          SF<INF>6</INF> returned to site after off-site recycling).
Disbursements of SF<INF>6</INF> = (Pounds of SF<INF>6</INF> contained in 
          new equipment delivered to customers) + (Pounds of 
          SF<INF>6</INF> delivered to equipment users in containers) + 
          (Pounds of SF<INF>6</INF> returned to suppliers) + (Pounds of 
          SF<INF>6</INF> sent off site for recycling) + (Pounds of 
          SF<INF>6</INF> sent off-site for destruction).

    (b) Use the mass-balance method in paragraph (a) of this section to 
estimate emissions of PFCs associated with the manufacture or 
refurbishment of power transformers, substituting the relevant PFC(s) 
for SF<INF>6</INF> in Equation SS-1 of this section.
    (c) Estimate the disbursements of SF<INF>6</INF> or PFCs sent to 
customers in new equipment or cylinders or sent off-site for other 
purposes including for recycling, for destruction or to be returned to 
suppliers using Equation SS-2 of this section:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR01DE10.057

Where:

    (d) Estimate the mass of SF<INF>6</INF> or PFCs disbursed to 
customers in new equipment or cylinders over the period p by monitoring 
the mass flow of the SF<INF>6</INF> or PFCs into the new equipment or 
cylinders using a flowmeter or by weighing containers before and after 
gas from containers is used to fill equipment or cylinders.
    (e) If the mass of SF<INF>6</INF> or the PFC disbursed to customers 
in new equipment or cylinders over the period p is estimated by weighing 
containers before and after gas from containers is used to fill 
equipment or cylinders, estimate this quantity using Equation SS-3 of 
this section:

E<INF>L =</INF> The mass of SF<INF>6</INF> or the PFC emitted during the 
          period p downstream of the containers used to fill equipment 
          or cylinders and in cases where a flowmeter is used, 
          downstream of the flowmeter during the period p (e.g., 
          emissions from hoses or other flow lines that connect the 
          container to the equipment or cylinder that is being filled).

    (f) If the mass of SF<INF>6</INF> or the PFC disbursed to customers 
in new equipment or cylinders over the period p is determined using a 
flowmeter, estimate this quantity using Equation SS-4 of this section:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR01DE10.059

Where:

Q<INF>p</INF> = The mass of SF<INF>6</INF> or the PFC charged into 
          equipment or containers over the period p sent to customers or 
          sent off-site for other purposes including for recycling, for 
          destruction or to be returned to suppliers.

          flowed through the flowmeter during the period p.
E<INF>L =</INF> The mass of SF<INF>6</INF> or the PFC emitted during the 
          period p downstream of the containers used to fill equipment 
          or cylinders and in cases where a flowmeter is used, 
          downstream of the flowmeter during the period p (e.g., 
          emissions from hoses or other flow lines that connect the 
          container to the equipment that is being filled).

    (g) Estimate the mass of SF<INF>6</INF> or the PFC emitted during

Where:

E<INF>L</INF> = The mass of SF<INF>6</INF> or the PFC emitted during the 
          period p downstream of the containers used to fill equipment 
          or cylinders and in cases where a flowmeter is used,

          period p.

    (h) The mass of SF<INF>6</INF> or the PFC disbursed to customers in 
new equipment over the period p must be determined either by using the 
nameplate capacity of the equipment or, in cases where equipment is 
shipped with a partial charge, by calculating the partial shipping 
charge. Calculate the partial shipping charge by multiplying the 
nameplate capacity of the equipment by the ratio of the densities of the 
partial charge to the full charge. To determine the equipment's actual 
nameplate capacity, you must measure the nameplate capacities of a 
representative sample of each make and model and take the average for 
each make and model as specified at Sec. 98.454(f).
    (i) Estimate the annual SF<INF>6</INF> and PFC emissions from the 
equipment that is installed at an off-site electric power transmission 
or distribution location before the title to the equipment is 
transferred by using Equation SS-6 of this section:

          installation at electric transmission or distribution 
          facilities.

          installed at electric transmission or distribution facilities.


<R05>
Sec. 98.454  Monitoring and QA/QC requirements.

    (a) For calendar year 2011 monitoring, you may follow the provisions 
of Sec. 98.3(d)(1) through (d)(2) for best available monitoring methods 
rather than follow the monitoring requirements of this section. For 
purposes of this subpart, any reference in Sec. 98.3(d)(1) through 
(d)(2) to 2010 means 2011, March 31 means June 30, and April 1 means 
July 1. Any reference to the effective date in Sec. 98.3(d)(1) through 
(d)(2) means February 28, 2011.
    (b) Ensure that all the quantities required by the equations of this 
subpart have been measured using either flowmeters with an accuracy and 
precision of <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>1 percent of full scale or better or 
scales with an accuracy and precision of <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>1 percent 
of the filled weight (gas plus tare) of the containers of SF<INF>6</INF> 
or PFCs that are typically weighed on the scale. For scales that are 
generally used to weigh cylinders containing 115 pounds of gas when 
full, this equates to <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>1 percent of the sum of 115 
pounds and approximately 120 pounds tare, or slightly more than <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>2 pounds. Account for the tare weights of the 
containers. You may accept gas masses or weights provided by the gas 
supplier e.g., for the contents of cylinders containing new gas or for 
the heels remaining in cylinders returned to the gas supplier) if the 
supplier provides documentation verifying that accuracy standards are 
met; however, you remain responsible for the accuracy of these masses 
and weights under this subpart.
    (c) All flow meters, weigh scales, and combinations of volumetric 
and density measures that are used to measure or calculate quantities 
under this subpart must be calibrated using calibration procedures 
specified by the flowmeter, scale, volumetric or density measure 
equipment manufacturer. Calibration must be performed prior to the first 
reporting year. After the initial calibration, recalibration must be 
performed at the minimum frequency specified by the manufacturer.
    (d) For purposes of Equations SS-5 of this subpart, the emission 
factor for the valve-hose combination (EF<INF>C</INF>) must be estimated 
using measurements and/

[[Page 774]]

or engineering assessments or calculations based on chemical engineering 
principles or physical or chemical laws or properties. Such assessments 
or calculations may be based on, as applicable, the internal volume of 
hose or line that is open to the atmosphere during coupling and 
decoupling activities, the internal pressure of the hose or line, the 
time the hose or line is open to the atmosphere during coupling and 
decoupling activities, the frequency with which the hose or line is 
purged and the flow rate during purges. You must develop a value for 
EF<INF>c</INF> (or use an industry-developed value) for each combination 
of hose and valve fitting, to use in Equation SS-5 of this subpart. The 
value for EF<INF>C</INF> must be determined for each combination of hose 
and valve fitting of a given diameter or size. The calculation must be 
recalculated annually to account for changes to the specifications of 
the valves or hoses that may occur throughout the year.
    (e) Electrical equipment manufacturers and refurbishers must account 
for SF<INF>6</INF> or PFC emissions that occur as a result of unexpected 
events or accidental losses, such as a malfunctioning hose or leak in 
the flow line, during the filling of equipment or containers for 
disbursement by including these losses in the estimated mass of 
SF<INF>6</INF> or the PFC emitted downstream of the container or 
flowmeter during the period p.
    (f) If the mass of SF<INF>6</INF> or the PFC disbursed to customers 
in new equipment over the period p is determined by assuming that it is 
equal to the equipment's nameplate capacity or, in cases where equipment 
is shipped with a partial charge, equal to its partial shipping charge, 
equipment samples for conducting the nameplate capacity tests must be 
selected using the following stratified sampling strategy in this 
paragraph. For each make and model, group the measurement conditions to 
reflect predictable variability in the facility's filling practices and 
conditions (e.g., temperatures at which equipment is filled). Then, 
independently select equipment samples at random from each make and 
model under each group of conditions. To account for variability, a 
certain number of these measurements must be performed to develop a 
robust and representative average nameplate capacity (or shipping 
charge) for each make, model, and group of conditions. A Student T 
distribution calculation should be conducted to determine how many 
samples are needed for each make, model, and group of conditions as a 
function of the relative standard deviation of the sample measurements. 
To determine a sufficiently precise estimate of the nameplate capacity, 
the number of measurements required must be calculated to achieve a 
precision of one percent of the true mean, using a 95 percent confidence 
interval. To estimate the nameplate capacity for a given make and model, 
you must use the lowest mean value among the different groups of 
conditions, or provide justification for the use of a different mean 
value for the group of conditions that represents the typical practices 
and conditions for that make and model. Measurements can be conducted 
using SF<INF>6</INF>, another gas, or a liquid. Re-measurement of 
nameplate capacities should be conducted every five years to reflect 
cumulative changes in manufacturing methods and conditions over time.
    (g) Ensure the following QA/QC methods are employed throughout the 
year:
    (1) Procedures are in place and followed to track and weigh all 
cylinders or other containers at the beginning and end of the year.
    (h) You must adhere to the following QA/QC methods for reviewing the 
completeness and accuracy of reporting:
    (1) Review inputs to Equation SS-1 of this subpart to ensure inputs 
and outputs to the company's system are included.
    (2) Do not enter negative inputs and confirm that negative emissions 
are not calculated. However, the decrease in SF<INF>6</INF> inventory 
may be calculated as negative.
    (3) Ensure that beginning-of-year inventory matches end-of-year 
inventory from the previous year.
    (4) Ensure that in addition to SF<INF>6</INF> purchased from bulk 
gas distributors, SF<INF>6</INF> returned from equipment users with or 
inside equipment and SF<INF>6</INF> returned from off-site recycling are 
also accounted for among the total additions.

    Source: 75 FR 39773, July 12, 2010, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 98.460  Definition of the source category.

    (a) This source category applies to industrial waste landfills that 
accepted waste on or after January 1, 1980, and that are located at a 
facility whose total landfill design capacity is greater than or equal 
to 300,000 metric tons.
    (b) An industrial waste landfill is a landfill other than a 
municipal solid waste landfill, a RCRA Subtitle C hazardous waste 
landfill, or a TSCA hazardous waste landfill, in which industrial solid 
waste, such as RCRA Subtitle D wastes (non-hazardous industrial solid 
waste, defined in 40 CFR 257.2), commercial solid wastes, or 
conditionally exempt small quantity generator wastes, is placed. An 
industrial waste landfill includes all disposal areas at the facility.
    (c) This source category does not include:

flares).


<R05>
Sec. 98.461  Reporting threshold.

    You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility 
contains an industrial waste landfill meeting the criteria in Sec. 
98.460 and the facility meets the requirements of Sec. 98.2(a)(2). For 
the purposes of Sec. 98.2(a)(2), the emissions from the industrial 
waste landfill are to be determined using the methane generation 
corrected for oxidation as determined using Equation TT-6 of this 
subpart times the global warming potential for methane in Table A-1 of 
subpart A of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 98.462  GHGs to report.

    (a) You must report CH<INF>4</INF> generation and CH<INF>4</INF> 
emissions from industrial waste landfills.
    (b) You must report CH<INF>4</INF> destruction resulting from 
landfill gas collection and destruction devices, if present.
    (c) You must report under subpart C of this part (General Stationary 
Fuel Combustion Sources) the emissions of CO<INF>2</INF>, 
CH<INF>4</INF>, and N<INF>2</INF>O from each stationary combustion unit 
associated with the landfill gas destruction device, if present, by 
following the requirements of subpart C of this part.

<R05>
Sec. 98.463  Calculating GHG emissions.

    (a) For each industrial waste landfill subject to the reporting 
requirements of this subpart, calculate annual modeled CH<INF>4</INF> 
generation according to the applicable requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) 
through (a)(3) of this section. Apply Equation TT-1 of this section for 
each waste stream disposed of in the landfill and sum the CH<INF>4</INF> 
generation rates for all waste streams disposed of in the landfill to 
calculate the total annual modeled CH<INF>4</INF> generation rate for 
the landfill.
    (1) Calculate annual modeled CH<INF>4</INF> generation using 
Equation TT-1 of this section.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR12JY10.020

Where:

G<INF>CH4</INF> = Modeled methane generation rate in reporting year T 
(metric tons CH<INF>4</INF>).
X = Year in which waste was disposed.
S = Start year of calculation. Use the year 1960 or the opening year of 
the landfill, whichever is more recent.
T = Reporting year for which emissions are calculated.
W<INF>x</INF> = Quantity of waste disposed in the industrial waste 
landfill in year X from measurement data and/or other company records 
(metric tons, as received (wet weight)).
DOC<INF>x</INF> = Degradable organic carbon for year X from Table TT-1 
of this subpart or from measurement data [as specified in paragraph 
(a)(3) of this section], if available [fraction (metric tons C/metric 
ton waste)].
DOC<INF>F</INF> = Fraction of DOC dissimilated (fraction); use the 
default value of 0.5.
MCF = Methane correction factor (fraction); use the default value of 1.
F<INF>x</INF> = Fraction by volume of CH<INF>4</INF> in landfill gas 
(fraction, dry basis). If you have a gas collection system, use the 
annual average CH<INF>4</INF> concentration from measurement data for 
the given year; otherwise, use the default value of 0.5.
k = Decay rate constant from Table TT-1 of this subpart 
(yr<SUP>-1</SUP>). Select the most applicable k value for the majority 
of the past 10 years (or operating life, whichever is shorter).

    (2) Waste stream quantities. Determine annual waste quantities as 
specified in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (ii) of this section for each 
year starting with January 1, 1980 or the year the landfills first 
accepted waste if after January 1, 1980, up until the most recent 
reporting year. The choice of method for determining waste quantities 
will vary according to the availability of historical data. Beginning in 
the first emissions monitoring year (2011 or later) and for each year 
thereafter, use the procedures in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section to 
determine waste stream quantities. These procedures should also be used 
for any year prior to the first emissions monitoring year for which the 
data are available. For other historical years, use paragraph (a)(2)(i) 
of this section, where waste disposal records are available, and use the 
procedures outlined in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section when waste 
disposal records are unavailable, to determine waste stream quantities. 
Historical disposal quantities deposited (i.e, prior to the first year 
in which monitoring begins) should only be determined once, as part of 
the first annual report, and the same values should be used for all 
subsequent annual reports, supplemented by the next year's data on new 
waste disposal.
    (i) Determine the quantity of waste (in metric tons as received, 
i.e., wet weight) disposed of in the landfill separately for each waste 
stream by any one or a combination of the following methods.
    (A) Direct mass measurements.
    (B) Direct volume measurements multiplied by waste stream density 
determined from periodic density measurement data or process knowledge.
    (C) Mass balance procedures, determining the mass of waste as the 
difference between the mass of the process inputs and the mass of the 
process outputs.
    (D) The number of loads (e.g., trucks) multiplied by the mass of 
waste per

[[Page 778]]

load based on the working capacity of the container or vehicle.
    (ii) Determine the historical disposal quantities for landfills 
using the Waste Disposal Factor approach in paragraphs (a)(2)(ii)(A) and 
(B) of this section when historical production or processing data are 
available. If production or processing data are available for a given 
year, you must use Equation TT-3 of this section for that year. 
Determine historical disposal quantities using the method specified in 
paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(C) of this section when historical production or 
processing data are not available, and for waste streams received from 
an off-site facility when historical disposal quantities cannot be 
determined using the methods specified in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this 
section.
    (A) Determining Waste Disposal Factor: For each waste stream 
disposed of in the landfill, calculate the average waste disposal rate 
per unit of production or unit throughput using all available waste 
quantity data and corresponding production or processing rates for the 
process generating that waste or, if appropriate, the facility, using 
Equation TT-2 of this section.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR12JY10.021

Where:

WDF = Average waste disposal factor as determined for the first annual 
report required for this industrial waste landfill (metric tons per 
production unit).
X = Year in which waste was disposed. Include only those years for which 
disposal and production data are both available; the years do not need 
to be sequential.
Y<INF>1</INF> = First year in which disposal and production/throughput 
data are both available.
Y<INF>2</INF> = First year for which GHG emissions from this industrial 
waste landfill must be reported.
N = Number of years for which disposal and production/throughput data 
are both available.
W<INF>x</INF> = Quantity of waste placed in the industrial waste 
landfill in year X from measurement data and/or other company records 
(metric tons, as received (wet weight)).
P<INF>x</INF> = Quantity of product produced or feedstock entering the 
process or facility in year X from measurement data and/or other company 
records (production units). You must use the same basis for all years in 
the calculation. That is, P<INF>x</INF> must be determined based on 
production (quantity of product produced) for all ``N'' years or 
P<INF>x</INF> must be determined based on throughput (quantity of 
feedstock) for all ``N'' years.

    (B) Calculate waste: For each waste stream disposed of in the 
landfill, calculate the waste disposal quantities for historic years in 
which direct waste disposal measurements are not available using 
historical production data and Equation TT-3 of this section.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR12JY10.022


Where:

X = Historic year in which waste was disposed.
W<INF>x</INF> = Calculated quantity of waste placed in the landfill in 
year X (metric tons).
WDF = Average waste disposal factor from Equation TT-2 of this section 
(metric tons per production unit).
P<INF>x</INF> = Quantity of product produced or feedstock entering the 
process or facility in year X from measurement data and/or other company 
records (production units). You must use the same basis for 
P<INF>x</INF> (either production only or throughput only) as used to 
determine WDF in Equation TT-2 of this section.

    (C) For any year in which historic production or processing data are 
not available such that historic waste quantities cannot be estimated 
using Equation TT-3 of this section, calculate an average annual bulk 
waste disposal quantity using fixed average annual bulk waste disposal 
quantity for each year for which historic disposal quantity and Equation 
TT-4 of this section.

Where:

W<INF>x</INF> = Quantity of waste placed in the landfill in year X 
(metric tons, wet basis).
LFC = Landfill capacity or, for operating landfills, capacity of the 
landfill used (or the total quantity of waste-in-place) at the end of 
the ``YrData'' from design drawings or engineering estimates (metric 
tons).
YrData = Year in which the landfill last received waste or, for 
operating landfills, the year prior to the year when waste disposal data 
is first available from company records or from Equation TT-3 of this 
section.
YrOpen = Year 1960 or the year in which the landfill first received 
waste from company records, whichever is more recent. If no data are 
available for estimating YrOpen for a closed landfill, use 1960 as the 
default ``YrOpen'' for the landfill.

    (3) Degradable organic content (DOC). For any year, X, in Equation 
TT-1 of this section, use either the applicable default DOC values 
provided in Table TT-1 of this subpart or determine values for 
DOC<INF>x</INF> as specified in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (iv) of 
this section. When developing historical waste quantity data, you may 
use default DOC values from Table TT-1 of this subpart for certain years 
and determined values for DOC<INF>x</INF> for other years. The 
historical values for DOC or DOC<INF>x</INF> must be developed only for 
the first annual report required for the industrial waste landfill; and 
used for all subsequent annual reports (e.g., if DOC for year x=1990 was 
determined to be 0.15 in the first reporting year, you must use 0.15 for 
the 1990 DOC value for all subsequent annual reports).
    (i) For the first year in which GHG emissions from this industrial 
waste landfill must be reported, determine the DOC<INF>x</INF> value of 
each waste stream disposed of in the landfill no less frequently than 
once per quarter using the methods specified in Sec. 98.464(b). 
Calculate annual DOC<INF>x</INF> for each waste stream as the arithmetic 
average of all DOC<INF>x</INF> values for that waste stream that were 
measured during the year.
    (ii) For subsequent years (after the first year in which GHG 
emissions from this industrial waste landfill must be reported), either 
use the DOC<INF>x</INF> of each waste stream calculated for the most 
recent reporting year for which DOC values were determined according to 
paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, or determine new DOC values for 
that year following the requirements in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this 
section. You must determine new DOC values following the requirements in 
paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section if changes in the process operations 
occurred during the previous reporting year that can reasonably be 
expected to alter the characteristics of the waste stream, such as the 
water content or volatile solids concentration. Should changes to the 
waste stream occur, you must revise the GHG Monitoring Plan as required 
in Sec. 98.3(g)(5)(iii) and report the new DOC<INF>x</INF> value 
according to the requirements of Sec. 98.466.
    (iii) If DOC<INF>x</INF> measurement data for each waste stream are 
available according to the methods specified in Sec. 98.464(b) for 
years prior to the first year in which GHG emissions from this 
industrial waste landfill must be reported, determine DOC<INF>x</INF> 
for each waste stream as the arithmetic average of all DOC<INF>x</INF> 
values for that waste stream that were measured in Year X. A single 
measurement value is acceptable for determining DOC<INF>x</INF> for 
years prior to the first reporting year.
    (iv) For historical years for which DOC<INF>x</INF> measurement 
data, determined according to the methods specified in Sec. 98.464(b), 
are not available, determine the historical values for DOC<INF>x</INF> 
using the applicable methods specified in paragraphs (a)(3)(iv)(A) and 
(B) of this section. Determine these historical values for 
DOC<INF>x</INF> only for the first annual report required for this 
industrial waste landfill; historical values for DOC<INF>x</INF> 
calculated for this first annual report should be used for all 
subsequent annual reports.
    (A) For years in which waste stream-specific disposal quantities are 
determined (as required in paragraphs (a)(2) (ii)(A) and (B) of this 
section), calculate the average DOC value for a given waste stream as 
the arithmetic average of all DOC measurements of that waste stream that 
follow the methods provided in Sec. 98.464(b), including any 
measurement values for years prior to the first reporting year and the 
four measurement values required in the first reporting year. Use the 
resulting waste-specific average DOC value for all applicable years 
(i.e., years in which waste stream-specific

[[Page 780]]

disposal quantities are determined) for which direct DOC measurement 
data are not available.
    (B) For years for which bulk waste disposal quantities are 
determined according to paragraphs (a)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, 
calculate the weighted average bulk DOC value according to the 
following: Calculate the average DOC value for each waste stream as the 
arithmetic average of all DOC measurements of that waste stream that 
follows the methods provided in Sec. 98.464(b) (generally, this will 
include only the DOC values determined in the first year in which GHG 
emissions from this industrial waste landfill must be reported); 
calculate the average annual disposal quantity for each waste stream as 
the arithmetic average of the annual disposal quantities for each year 
in which waste stream-specific disposal quantities have been determined; 
and calculate the bulk waste DOC value using Equation TT-5 of this 
section. Use the bulk waste DOC value as DOC<INF>x</INF> for all years 
for which bulk waste disposal quantities are determined according to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(ii)(C) of this section.

    (b) For each landfill, calculate CH<INF>4</INF> generation (adjusted 
for oxidation in cover materials) and CH<INF>4</INF> emissions (taking 
into account any CH<INF>4</INF> recovery, if applicable, and oxidation 
in cover materials) according to the applicable methods in paragraphs 
(b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section.
    (1) For each landfill, calculate CH<INF>4</INF> generation, adjusted

Sec. 98.468  Definitions.

    Except as provided below, all terms used in this subpart have the 
same meaning given in the CAA and subpart A of this part.
    Solid waste has the meaning established by the Administrator 
pursuant to the Solid Waste Disposal Act (42 U.S.C.A. 6901 et seq.).
    Waste stream means industrial solid waste material that is generated 
by a specific manufacturing process or client. For wastes generated at 
the facility that includes the industrial waste landfill, a waste stream 
is the industrial solid waste material generated by a specific 
processing unit at that facility. For industrial solid wastes that are 
received from off-site facilities, a waste stream can be defined as each 
waste shipment or group of waste shipments received from a single client 
or group of clients that produce industrial solid wastes with similar 
waste properties.

  leachate recirculated and applied to the landfill divided by the area of the portion of the landfill
  containing waste [with appropriate unit conversions].
(1) Dry climate = precipitation plus recirculated leachate less than 20 inches/year.
(2) Moderate climate = precipitation plus recirculated leachate from 20 to 40 inches/year (inclusive).
(3) Wet climate = precipitation plus recirculated leachate greater than 40 inches/year.

    (2) If you are measuring the volume of contents in a container under 
the provisions of Sec. 98.474(a)(2)(ii), you must calculate the 
CO<INF>2</INF> received in containers using Equation UU-2 of this 
section.

Where:

CO<INF>2T,r</INF> = Annual mass of CO<INF>2</INF> received in containers 
          r (metric tons).
C<INF>CO2,p,r</INF> = Quarterly CO<INF>2</INF> concentration measurement 
          of contents in containers r in quarter p (vol. percent 
          CO<INF>2</INF>, expressed as a decimal fraction).
S<INF>r,p</INF> = Quarterly mass of contents in containers r that is 
          redelivered to another facility without being injected into 
          your well in quarter p (standard cubic meters).
Q<INF>r,p</INF> = Quarterly volume of contents in containers r in 
          quarter p (standard cubic meters).
D = Density of the CO<INF>2</INF> received in containers at standard 
          conditions (metric tons per standard cubic meter): 0.0018682.
p = Quarter of the year.
r = Containers.


<R05>
Sec. 98.474  Monitoring and QA/QC requirements.

    (a) CO<INF>2</INF> received.
    (1) You must determine the quarterly flow rate of CO<INF>2</INF> 
received by pipeline by following the most appropriate of the following 
procedures:
    (i) You may measure flow rate at the receiving custody transfer 
meter prior to any subsequent processing operations at the facility and 
collect the flow rate quarterly.
    (ii) If you took ownership of the CO<INF>2</INF> in a commercial 
transaction, you may use the quarterly flow rate data from the sales 
contract if it is a one-time transaction or from invoices or manifests 
if it is an ongoing commercial transaction with discrete shipments.

[[Page 786]]

    (iii) If you inject CO<INF>2</INF> from a production process unit 
that is part of your facility, you may use the quarterly CO<INF>2</INF> 
flow rate that was measured at the equivalent of a custody transfer 
meter following procedures provided in subpart PP of this part. To be 
the equivalent of a custody transfer meter, a meter must measure the 
flow of CO<INF>2</INF> being transported to an injection well to the 
same degree of accuracy as a meter used for commercial transactions.
    (2) You must determine the quarterly mass or volume of contents in 
all containers if you receive CO<INF>2</INF> in containers by the most 
appropriate of the following procedures:
    (i) You may measure the mass of contents of containers summed 
quarterly using weigh bills, scales, or load cells.
    (ii) You may determine the volume of the contents of containers 
summed quarterly.
    (iii) If you took ownership of the CO<INF>2</INF> in a commercial 
transaction, you may use the quarterly mass or volume of contents from 
the sales contract if it is a one-time transaction or from invoices or 
manifests if it is an ongoing commercial transaction with discrete 
shipments.
    (3) You must determine a quarterly concentration of the 
CO<INF>2</INF> received that is representative of all CO<INF>2</INF> 
received in that quarter by following the most appropriate of the 
following procedures:
    (i) You may sample the CO<INF>2</INF> stream at least once per 
quarter at the point of receipt and measure its CO<INF>2</INF> 
concentration.
    (ii) If you took ownership of the CO<INF>2</INF> in a commercial 
transaction for which the sales contract was contingent on 
CO<INF>2</INF> concentration, and if the supplier of the CO<INF>2</INF> 
sampled the CO<INF>2</INF> stream in a quarter and measured its 
concentration per the sales contract terms, you may use the 
CO<INF>2</INF> concentration data from the sales contract for that 
quarter.
    (iii) If you inject CO<INF>2</INF> from a production process unit 
that is part of your facility, you may report the quarterly 
CO<INF>2</INF> concentration of the CO<INF>2</INF> stream supplied that 
was measured following procedures provided in subpart PP of this part as 
the quarterly CO<INF>2</INF> concentration of the CO<INF>2</INF> stream 
received.
    (4) You must assume that the CO<INF>2</INF> you receive meets the 
definition of a CO<INF>2</INF> stream unless you can trace it through 
written records to a source other than a CO<INF>2</INF> stream.
    (b) Measurement devices.
    (1) All flow meters must be operated continuously except as 
necessary for maintenance and calibration.
    (2) You must calibrate all flow meters used to measure quantities 
reported in Sec. 98.476 according to the calibration and accuracy 
requirements in Sec. 98.3(i).
    (3) You must operate all measurement devices according to one of the 
following. You may use an appropriate standard method published by a 
consensus-based standards organization if such a method exists or an 
industry standard practice. Consensus-based standards organizations 
include, but are not limited to, the following: ASTM International, the 
American National Standards Institute (ANSI), the American Gas 
Association (AGA), the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), 
the American Petroleum Institute (API), and the North American Energy 
Standards Board (NAESB).
    (4) You must ensure that any flow meter calibrations performed are 
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) traceable.
    (c) General.
    (1) If you measure the concentration of any CO<INF>2</INF> quantity 
for reporting, you must measure according to one of the following. You 
may use an appropriate standard method published by a consensus-based 
standards organization if such a method exists or an industry standard 
practice.
    (2) You must convert all measured volumes of CO<INF>2</INF> to the 
following standard industry temperature and pressure conditions for use 
in Equations UU-2 of this subpart: standard cubic meters at a 
temperature of 60 degrees Fahrenheit and at an absolute pressure of 1 
atmosphere.
    (3) For 2011, you may follow the provisions of Sec. 98.3(d)(1) 
through (2) for best available monitoring methods rather than follow the 
monitoring requirements of this section. For purposes of this subpart, 
any reference to

[[Page 787]]

the year 2010 in Sec. 98.3(d)(1) through (2) shall mean 2011.
