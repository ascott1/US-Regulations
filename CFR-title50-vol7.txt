                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, October 1, 2008), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

Sec. 216.6  Forfeiture and return of seized property.

    (a) Whenever any cargo or marine mammal or marine mammal product has 
been seized pursuant to section 107 of the MMPA, the Secretary shall 
expedite any proceedings commenced under these regulations.
    (b) Whenever a civil penalty has been assessed by the Secretary 
under these regulations, any cargo, marine mammal, or marine mammal 
product seized pursuant to section 107 of the MMPA shall be subject to 
forfeiture. If respondent voluntarily forfeits any such seized property 
or the monetary value thereof without court proceedings, the Secretary 
may apply the value thereof, if any, as determined by the Secretary, 
toward payment of the civil penalty.
    (c) Whenever a civil penalty has been assessed under these 
regulations, and whether or not such penalty has been paid, the 
Secretary may request the Attorney General to institute a civil action 
in an appropriate United States District Court to compel forfeiture of 
such seized property or the monetary value thereof to the Secretary for 
disposition by him in such manner as he deems appropriate. If no 
judicial action to compel forfeiture is commenced within 30 days after 
final decision-making assessment of a civil penalty, pursuant to Sec. 
216.60, such seized property shall immediately be returned to the 
respondent.
    (d) If the final decision of the Secretary under these regulations 
is that respondent has committed no violation of the MMPA or of any 
permit or regulations issued thereunder, any marine mammal, marine 
mammal product, or other cargo seized from respondent in connection with 
the proceedings under these regulations, or the bond or other monetary 
value substituted therefor, shall immediately be returned to the 
respondent.
    (e) If the Attorney General commences criminal proceedings pursuant 
to section 105(b) of the MMPA, and such proceedings result in a finding 
that the person accused is not guilty of a criminal violation of the 
MMPA, the Secretary may institute proceedings for the assessment of a 
civil penalty under this part: Provided, That if no such civil penalty 
proceedings have been commenced by the Secretary within 30 days 
following the final disposition of the criminal case, any property 
seized pursuant to section 107 of the MMPA shall be returned to the 
respondent.
    (f) If any seized property is to be returned to the respondent, the 
Regional Director shall issue a letter authorizing such return. This 
letter shall be dispatched to the respondent by registered mail, return 
receipt requested, and shall identify the respondent, the seized 
property, and, if appropriate, the bailee of the seized property. It 
shall also provide that upon presentation of the letter and proper 
identification, the seized property is authorized to be released. All 
charges for storage, care, or handling of the seized property accruing 5 
days or more after the date of the return receipt shall be for the 
account of the respondent: Provided, That if it is the final decision of 
the Secretary under these regulations that the respondent has committed 
the alleged violation, all charges which have accrued for the storage, 
care, or handling of the seized property shall be for the account of the 
respondent.

of marine mammals to be depleted, he may prescribe regulations pursuant 
to section 103 of the MMPA upon the taking of such marine animals by any 
Indian, Aleut, or Eskimo and, after promulgation of such regulations, 
all takings of such marine mammals shall conform to such regulations.
    (e) Marking and reporting of Cook Inlet Beluga Whales--(1) 
Definitions. In addition to definitions contained in the MMPA and the 
regulations in this part:
    (i) Reporting means the collection and delivery of biological data, 
harvest data, and other information regarding the effect of taking a 
beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas) from Cook Inlet, as required by 
NMFS.
    (ii) Whaling captain or vessel operator means the individual who is 
identified by Alaskan Natives as the leader of each hunting team 
(usually the other

[[Page 20]]

crew on the boat) and who is the whaling captain; or the individual 
operating the boat at the time the whale is harvested or transported to 
the place of processing.
    (iii) Cook Inlet means all waters of Cook Inlet north of 59[deg] 
North latitude, including, but not limited to, waters of Kachemak Bay, 
Kamishak Bay, Chinitna Bay, and Tuxedni Bay.
    (2) Marking. Each whaling captain or vessel operator, upon killing 
and landing a beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas) from Cook Inlet, 
Alaska, must remove the lower left jawbone, leaving the teeth intact and 
in place. When multiple whales are harvested during one hunting trip, 
the jawbones will be marked for identification in the field to ensure 
correct reporting of harvest information by placing a label marked with 
the date, time, and location of harvest within the container in which 
the jawbone is placed. The jawbone(s) must be retained by the whaling 
captain or vessel operator and delivered to NMFS at the Anchorage Field 
Office, 222 West 7th Avenue, Anchorage, Alaska 99513 within 72 hours of 
returning from the hunt.
    (3) Reporting. Upon delivery to NMFS of a jawbone, the whaling 
captain or vessel operator must complete and mail a reporting form, 
available from NMFS, to the NMFS Anchorage Field Office within 30 days. 
A separate form is required for each whale harvested.
    (i) To be complete, the form must contain the following information: 
the date and location of kill, the method of harvest, and the coloration 
of the whale. The respondent will also be invited to report on any other 
observations concerning the animal or circumstance of the harvest.
    (ii) Data collected pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section will 
be reported on forms obtained from the Anchorage Field Office. These 
data will be maintained in the NMFS Alaska Regional Office in Juneau, 
Alaska, where such data will be available for public review.
    (4) No person may falsify any information required to be set forth 
on the reporting form as required by paragraph (e) of this section.
    (5) The Anchorage Field Office of NMFS is located in room 517 of the 
Federal Office Building, 222 West 7th Avenue; its mailing address is: 
NMFS, Box 43, Anchorage, AK. 99513.
    (f) Harvest management of Cook Inlet beluga whales--(1) Cooperative 
management of subsistence harvest. Subject to the provisions of 16 
U.S.C. 1371(b) and any further limitations set forth in Sec. 216.23, 
any taking of a Cook Inlet beluga whale by an Alaska Native must be 
authorized under an agreement for the co-management of subsistence uses 
(hereinafter in this paragraph ``co-management agreement'') between the 
National Marine Fisheries Service and an Alaska Native organization(s).
    (2) Limitations. (i) Sale of Cook Inlet beluga whale parts and 
products. Authentic Native articles of handicraft and clothing made from 
nonedible by-products of beluga whales taken in accordance with the 
provisions of this paragraph may be sold in interstate commerce. The 
sale of any other part or product, including food stuffs, from Cook 
Inlet beluga whales is prohibited, provided that nothing herein shall be 
interpreted to prohibit or restrict customary and traditional 
subsistence practices of barter and sharing of Cook Inlet beluga parts 
and products.
    (ii) Beluga whale calves or adults with calves. The taking of a calf 
or an adult whale accompanied by a calf is prohibited.
    (iii) Season. All takings of beluga whales authorized under Sec. 
216.23(f) shall occur no earlier than July 1 of each year.
    (iv) Taking during 2001-2004. The harvest of Cook Inlet beluga 
whales is restricted during the four-year period of 2001-2004 as 
follows:
    (A) Strike limitations. Subject to the suspension provision of 
subparagraph (C), a total of six (6) strikes, which could result in up 
to six landings, are to be allocated through co-management agreement(s).
    (B) Strike allocations. Four strikes, not to exceed one per year, 
are allocated to the Native Village of Tyonek. The remaining two strikes 
will be allocated over the 4-year period through co-management agreement 
with other Cook Inlet community hunters, with no more than one such 
strike being allocated during every other year.

[[Page 21]]

    (C) Emergency provisions. Takings of beluga whales authorized under 
Sec. 216.23 will be suspended whenever unusual mortalities exceed six 
(6) whales in any year. ``Unusual mortalities'' include all documented 
human-caused mortality (including illegal takings and net entanglements 
but excluding all legally harvested whales) and all documented mortality 
resulting from unknown or natural causes that occur above normal levels, 
considered for the purposes of this provision to be twelve beluga whales 
per year. The level of unusual mortalities shall be calculated by 
documenting mortality for the calendar year and subtracting twelve. The 
sum of this result and the carry over of unusual mortality from any 
previous year from which the population has not recovered is the level 
of unusual mortalities for the current year. If in any year the number 
of unusual mortalities exceeds six whales, no strikes will be allowed in 
that year or in subsequent years until the population has recovered from 
those mortalities through foregone future harvests and natural 
recruitment.
    (v) Taking during 2005 and subsequent years. [Reserved]

<R05>
Sec. 216.24  Taking and related acts incidental to commercial fishing
operations by tuna purse seine vessels in the eastern tropical

Pacific Ocean.

    (a)(1) No marine mammal may be taken in the course of a commercial 
fishing operation by a U.S. purse seine fishing vessel in the ETP unless 
the taking constitutes an incidental catch as defined in Sec. 216.3, 
and vessel and operator permits have been obtained in accordance with 
these regulations, and such taking is not in violation of such permits 
or regulations.
    (2)(i) It is unlawful for any person using a U.S. purse seine 
fishing vessel of 400 short tons (st) (362.8 metric tons (mt)) carrying 
capacity or less to intentionally deploy a net on or to encircle 
dolphins, or to carry more than two speedboats, if any part of its 
fishing trip is in the ETP.
    (ii) It is unlawful for any person using a U.S. purse seine fishing 
vessel of greater than 400 st (362.8 mt) carrying capacity that does not 
have a valid permit obtained under these regulations to catch, possess, 
or land tuna if any part of the vessel's fishing trip is in the ETP.
    (iii) It is unlawful for any person subject to the jurisdiction of 
the United States to receive, purchase, or possess tuna caught, 
possessed, or landed in violation of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this 
section.
    (iv) It is unlawful for any person subject to the jurisdiction of 
the United States to intentionally deploy a purse seine net on, or to 
encircle, dolphins from a vessel operating in the ETP when there is not 
a DML assigned to that vessel.
    (v) It is unlawful for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the 
United States to intentionally deploy a purse seine net on, or to 
encircle, dolphins from a vessel operating in the ETP with an assigned 
DML after a set in which the DML assigned to that vessel has been 
reached or exceeded.
    (vi) Alleged violations of the Agreement on the IDCP and/or these 
regulations identified by the International Review Panel will be 
considered for potential enforcement action by NMFS.
    (3) Upon written request made in advance of entering the ETP, the 
limitations in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (a)(2)(ii) of this section may 
be waived by the Administrator, Southwest Region, for the purpose of 
allowing transit through the ETP. The waiver will provide, in writing, 
the terms and conditions under which the vessel must operate, including 
a requirement to report to the Administrator, Southwest Region, the 
vessel's date of exit from or subsequent entry into the permit area.
    (b) Permits--(1) Vessel permit. The owner or managing owner of a 
U.S. purse seine fishing vessel of greater than 400 st (362.8 mt) 
carrying capacity that participates in commercial fishing operations in 
the ETP must possess a valid vessel permit issued under paragraph (b) of 
this section. This permit is not transferable and must be renewed

[[Page 22]]

annually. If a vessel permit holder surrenders his/her permit to the 
Administrator, Southwest Region, the permit will not be returned and a 
new permit will not be issued before the end of the calendar year. 
Vessel permits will be valid through December 31 of each year.
    (2) Operator permit. The person in charge of and actually 
controlling fishing operations (hereinafter referred to as the operator) 
on a U.S. purse seine fishing vessel engaged in commercial fishing 
operations under a vessel permit must possess a valid operator permit 
issued under paragraph (b) of this section. Such permits are not 
transferable and must be renewed annually. To receive a permit, the 
operator must have satisfactorily completed all required training under 
paragraph (c)(5) of this section. The operator's permit is valid only 
when the permit holder is on a vessel with a valid vessel permit. 
Operator permits will be valid through December 31 of each year.
    (3) Possession and display. A valid vessel permit issued pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section must be on board the vessel while 
engaged in fishing operations, and a valid operator permit issued 
pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section must be in the possession 
of the operator to whom it was issued. Permits must be shown upon 
request to NMFS enforcement agents, U.S. Coast Guard officers, or 
designated agents of NMFS or the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission 
(IATTC) (including observers). A vessel owner or operator who is at sea 
on a fishing trip when his or her permit expires and to whom a permit 
for the next year has been issued, may take marine mammals under the 
terms of the new permit without having to display it on board the vessel 
until the vessel returns to port.
    (4) Application for vessel permit. The owner or managing owner of a 
purse seine vessel may apply for a permit from the Administrator, 
Southwest Region, allowing at least 15 days for processing. All vessel 
permit applications must be faxed to (562) 980-4027. An owner or 
managing owner requesting to have a vessel in excess of 400 st (362.8

    (iv) The date, location, and provider of training required under 
paragraph (c)(5) of this section for the operator permit; and
    (v) The applicant's signature or the signature of the applicant's 
representative.
    (6) Fees--(i) Vessel permit application fees. Payment of the permit 
application fee is required before NMFS will issue a permit. The 
Assistant Administrator may change the amount of this fee at any time if 
a different fee is determined in accordance with the NOAA Finance 
Handbook. The amount of the fee will be printed on the vessel permit 
application form provided by the Administrator, Southwest Region.
    (ii) Operator permit fee. There is no fee for the operator permit. 
The Assistant Administrator may require a fee at any time if a fee is 
determined in accordance with the NOAA Finance Handbook and specified by 
the Administrator, Southwest Region, on the application form.
    (iii) Observer placement fee. The observer placement fee supports 
the placement of observers on individual vessels, and maintenance of the 
observer program, as established by the IATTC or other approved observer 
program.
    (A) The owner or managing owner of a vessel for which a DML has been 
requested must submit the observer placement fee, as established by the 
IATTC or other approved observer program, to the Administrator, 
Southwest Region, no later than September 15 of the year prior to the 
calendar year for which the DML was requested. Payment of the observer 
placement fee must be consistent with the fee for active status on the 
Vessel Register under Sec. 300.22(b)(4) of this title.
    (B) The owner or managing owner of a vessel for which a DML has not 
been requested, but that is listed on the Vessel Register, as defined in 
Sec. 300.21 of this title, must submit payment of the observer 
placement fee, as established by the IATTC or other approved observer 
program, to the Administrator, Southwest Region, no later than November 
30 of the year prior to the calendar year in which the vessel will be 
listed on the Vessel Register. Payment of the observer placement fee 
must be consistent with the vessel's status, either active or inactive, 
on the Vessel Register in Sec. 300.22(b)(4) of this title.
    (C) The owner or managing owner of a purse seine vessel that is 
licensed under the South Pacific Tuna Treaty must submit the observer 
placement fee, as established by the IATTC or other approved observer 
program, to the Administrator, Southwest Region, prior to obtaining an 
observer and entering the ETP to fish. Consistent with Sec. 
300.22(b)(1)(i) of this title, this class of purse seine vessels is not 
required to be listed on the Vessel Register under Sec. 300.22(b)(4) of 
this title in order to purse seine for tuna in the ETP during a single 
fishing trip per calendar year of 90 days or less. Payment of the 
observer placement fee must be consistent with the fee for active status 
on the Vessel Register under Sec. 300.22(b)(4) of this title.
    (D) The owner or managing owner of a purse seine vessel listed as 
inactive on the Vessel Register at the beginning of the calendar year 
and who requests to replace a vessel removed from active status on the 
Vessel Register under Sec. 300.22(b)(4) of this title during the year, 
must pay the observer placement fee associated with active status less 
the observer placement fee associated with inactive status that was 
already paid before NMFS will request the IATTC Secretariat change the 
status of the vessel from inactive to active.
    (E) The owner or managing owner of a purse seine vessel not listed 
on the Vessel Register at the beginning of the calendar year and who 
requests to replace a vessel removed from active status on the Vessel 
Register under Sec. 300.22(b)(4) of this title during the year, must 
pay the observer placement fee associated with active status before NMFS 
will request the IATTC Secretariat change the status of the vessel to 
active.
    (F) Payments received after the dates specified in paragraphs (b) 
(6) (iii)(A) or (B) of this section will be subject to a 10 percent 
surcharge. The Administrator, Southwest Region, will forward all 
observer placement fees described in this section to the IATTC or to the

[[Page 24]]

applicable organization approved by the Administrator, Southwest Region.
    (7) Application approval. The Administrator, Southwest Region, will 
determine the adequacy and completeness of an application and, upon 
determining that an application is adequate and complete, will approve 
that application and issue the appropriate permit, except for applicants 
having unpaid or overdue civil penalties, criminal fines, or other 
liabilities incurred in a legal proceeding.
    (8) Conditions applicable to all permits--(i) General conditions. 
Failure to comply with the provisions of a permit or with these 
regulations may lead to suspension, revocation, modification, or denial 
of a permit. The permit holder, vessel, vessel owner, operator, or 
master may be subject, jointly or severally, to the penalties provided 
for under the MMPA. Procedures governing permit sanctions and denials 
are found at subpart D of 15 CFR part 904.
    (ii) Observer placement. By obtaining a permit, the permit holder 
consents to the placement of an observer on the vessel during every trip 
involving operations in the ETP and agrees to payment of the fees for 
observer placement. No observer will be assigned to a vessel unless that 
vessel owner has submitted payment of observer fees to the 
Administrator, Southwest Region. The observers may be placed under an 
observer program of NMFS, IATTC, or another observer program approved by 
the Administrator, Southwest Region.
    (iii) Explosives. The use of explosive devices is prohibited during 
all tuna purse seine operations that involve marine mammals.
    (iv) Reporting requirements. (A) The vessel permit holder of each 
permitted vessel must notify the Administrator, Southwest Region or the 
IATTC contact designated by the Administrator, Southwest Region, at 
least 5 days in advance of the vessel's departure on a fishing trip to 
allow for observer placement on every trip.
    (B) The vessel permit holder must notify the Administrator, 
Southwest Region, or the IATTC contact designated by the Administrator, 
Southwest Region, of any change of vessel operator at least 48 hours 
prior to departing on a fishing trip. In the case of a change in 
operator due to an emergency, notification must be made within 72 hours 
of the change.
    (v) Data release. By using a permit, the permit holder authorizes 
the release to NMFS and the IATTC of all data collected by observers 
aboard purse seine vessels during fishing trips under the IATTC observer 
program or another international observer program approved by the 
Administrator, Southwest Region. The permit holder must furnish the 
international observer program with all release forms required to 
authorize the observer data to be provided to NMFS and the IATTC. Data 
obtained under such releases will be used for the same purposes as would 
data collected directly by observers placed by NMFS and will be subject 
to the same standards of confidentiality.
    (9) Mortality and serious injury reports. The Administrator, 
Southwest Region, will provide to the public periodic status reports 
summarizing the estimated incidental dolphin mortality and serious 
injury by U.S. vessels of individual species and stocks.
    (c) Purse seining by vessels with Dolphin Mortality Limits (DMLs). 
In addition to the terms and conditions set forth in paragraph (b) of 
this section, any permit for a vessel to which a DML has been assigned 
under paragraph (c)(9) of this section and any operator permit when used 
on such a vessel are subject to the following terms and conditions:
    (1) A vessel may be used to chase and encircle schools of dolphins 
in the ETP only under the immediate direction of the holder of a valid 
operator's permit.
    (2) No retention of live marine mammals. Except as otherwise 
authorized by a specific permit, live marine mammals incidentally taken 
must be immediately returned to the ocean without further injury. The 
operator of a purse seine vessel must take every precaution to refrain 
from causing or permitting incidental mortality or serious injury of 
marine mammals. Live marine mammals may not be brailed, sacked up, or 
hoisted onto the deck during ortza retrieval.
    (3) Gear and equipment required for valid permit. A vessel 
possessing a vessel permit for purse seining involving

[[Page 25]]

the intentional taking of marine mammals may not engage in fishing 
operations involving the intentional deployment of the net on or 
encirclement of dolphins unless it is equipped with a dolphin safety 
panel in its purse seine, has the other required gear and equipment, and 
uses the required procedures.
    (i) Dolphin safety panel. The dolphin safety panel must be a minimum 
of 180 fathoms in length (as measured before installation), except that 
the minimum length of the panel in nets deeper than 18 strips must be 
determined in a ratio of 10 fathoms in length for each strip of net 
depth. It must be installed so as to protect the perimeter of the 
backdown area. The perimeter of the backdown area is the length of 
corkline that begins at the outboard end of the last bowbunch pulled and 
continues to at least two-thirds the distance from the backdown channel 
apex to the stern tiedown point. The dolphin safety panel must consist 
of small mesh webbing not to exceed 1 1/4 inches (3.18 centimeters (cm)) 
stretch mesh extending downward from the corkline and, if present, the 
base of the dolphin apron to a minimum depth equivalent to two strips of 
100 meshes of 4 1/4 inches (10.80 cm) stretch mesh webbing. In addition, 
at least a 20-fathom length of corkline must be free from bunchlines at 
the apex of the backdown channel.
    (ii) Dolphin safety panel markers. Each end of the dolphin safety 
panel and dolphin apron, if present, must be identified with an easily 
distinguishable marker.
    (iii) Dolphin safety panel hand holds. Throughout the length of the 
corkline under which the dolphin safety panel and dolphin apron are 
located, hand hold openings must be secured so that they will not allow 
the insertion of a 1 3/8 inch (3.50 cm) diameter cylindrical-shaped 
object.
    (iv) Dolphin safety panel corkline hangings. Throughout the length 
of the corkline under which the dolphin safety panel and dolphin apron 
if present, are located, corkline hangings must be inspected by the 
vessel operator following each trip. Hangings found to have loosened to 
the extent that a cylindrical-shaped object with a 1 3/8 inch (3.50 cm) 
diameter can be inserted between the cork and corkline hangings, must be 
tightened so as not to allow the insertion of a cylindrical-shaped 
object with a 1 3/8 inch (3.50 cm) diameter.
    (v) Speedboats. A minimum of three speedboats in operating condition 
must be carried. All speedboats carried aboard purse seine vessels and 
in operating condition must be rigged with tow lines and towing bridles 
or towing posts. Speedboat hoisting bridles may not be substituted for 
towing bridles.
    (vi) Raft. A raft suitable to be used as a dolphin observation-and-
rescue platform must be carried.
    (vii) Facemask and snorkel, or viewbox. At least two facemasks and 
snorkels or viewboxes must be carried.
    (viii) Lights. The vessel must be equipped with lights capable of 
producing a minimum of 140,000 lumens of output for use in darkness to 
ensure sufficient light to observe that procedures for dolphin release 
are carried out and to monitor incidental dolphin mortality.
    (4) Vessel inspection--(i) Annual. At least once during each 
calendar year, purse seine nets and other gear and equipment required 
under Sec. 216.24(c)(3) must be made available for inspection and for a 
trial set/net alignment by an authorized NMFS inspector or IATTC staff 
as specified by the Administrator, Southwest Region, in order to obtain 
a vessel permit.
    (ii) Reinspection. Purse seine nets and other gear and equipment 
required by these regulations must be made available for reinspection by 
an authorized NMFS inspector or IATTC staff as specified by the 
Administrator, Southwest Region. The vessel permit holder must notify 
the Administrator, Southwest Region, of any net modification at least 5 
days prior to departure of the vessel in order to determine whether a 
reinspection or trial set/net alignment is required.
    (iii) Failure to pass inspection. Upon failure to pass an inspection 
or reinspection, a vessel may not engage in purse seining involving the 
intentional taking of marine mammals until the deficiencies in gear or 
equipment are corrected as required by NMFS.
    (5) Operator permit holder training requirements. An operator must 
maintain

[[Page 26]]

proficiency sufficient to perform the procedures required herein, and 
must attend and satisfactorily complete a formal training session 
approved by the Administrator, Southwest Region, in order to obtain his 
or her permit. At the training session, an attendee will be instructed 
on the relevant provisions and regulatory requirements of the MMPA and 
the IDCP, and the fishing gear and techniques that are required for 
reducing serious injury and mortality of dolphin incidental to purse 
seining for tuna. Operators who have received a written certificate of 
satisfactory completion of training and who possess a current or 
previous calendar year permit will not be required to attend additional 
formal training sessions unless there are substantial changes in the 
relevant provisions or implementing regulations of the MMPA or the IDCP, 
or in fishing gear and techniques. Additional training may be required 
for any operator who is found by the Administrator, Southwest Region, to 
lack proficiency in the required fishing procedures or familiarity with 
the relevant provisions or regulations of the MMPA or the IDCP.
    (6) Marine mammal release requirements. All operators fishing 
pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section must use the following 
procedures during all sets involving the incidental taking of marine 
mammals in association with the capture and landing of tuna.
    (i) Backdown procedure. Backdown must be performed following a purse 
seine set in which dolphins are captured in the course of catching tuna, 
and must be continued until it is no longer possible to remove live 
dolphins from the net by this procedure. At least one crewmember must be 
deployed during backdown to aid in the release of dolphins. Thereafter, 
other release procedures required will be continued so that all live 
dolphins are released prior to the initiation of the sack-up procedure.
    (ii) Prohibited use of sharp or pointed instrument. The use of a 
sharp or pointed instrument to remove any marine mammal from the net is 
prohibited.
    (iii) Sundown sets prohibited. On every set encircling dolphin, the 
backdown procedure must be completed no later than one-half hour after 
sundown, except as provided here. For the purpose of this section, 
sundown is defined as the time at which the upper edge of the sun 
disappears below the horizon or, if the view of the sun is obscured, the 
local time of sunset calculated from tables developed by the U.S. Naval 
Observatory or other authoritative source approved by the Administrator, 
Southwest Region. A sundown set is a set in which the backdown procedure 
has not been completed and rolling the net to sack-up has not begun 
within one-half hour after sundown. Should a set extend beyond one-half 
hour after sundown, the operator must use the required marine mammal 
release procedures including the use of the high intensity lighting 
system. In the event a sundown set occurs where the seine skiff was let 
go 90 or more minutes before sundown, and an earnest effort to rescue 
dolphins is made, the International Review Panel of the IDCP may 
recommend to the United States that in the view of the International 
Review Panel, prosecution by the United States is not recommended. Any 
such recommendation will be considered by the United States in 
evaluating the appropriateness of prosecution in a particular 
circumstance.
    (iv) Dolphin safety panel. During backdown, the dolphin safety panel 
must be positioned so that it protects the perimeter of the backdown 
area. The perimeter of the backdown area is the length of corkline that 
begins at the outboard end of the last bow bunch pulled and continues to 
at least two-thirds the distance from the backdown channel apex to the 
stern tiedown point.
    (7) Experimental fishing operations. The Administrator, Southwest 
Region, may authorize experimental fishing operations, consistent with 
the provisions of the IDCP, for the purpose of testing proposed 
improvements in fishing techniques and equipment that may reduce or 
eliminate dolphin mortality or serious injury, or do not require the 
encirclement of dolphins in the course of fishing operations. The 
Administrator, Southwest Region, may waive, as appropriate, any 
requirements of this section except DMLs and the obligation to carry an 
observer.

[[Page 27]]

    (i) A vessel permit holder may apply for an experimental fishing 
operation waiver by submitting the following information to the 
Administrator, Southwest Region, no less than 90 days before the date 
the proposed operation is intended to begin:
    (A) The name(s) of the vessel(s) and the vessel permit holder(s) to 
participate;
    (B) A statement of the specific vessel gear and equipment or 
procedural requirement to be exempted and why such an exemption is 
necessary to conduct the experiment;
    (C) A description of how the proposed modification to the gear and 
equipment or procedures is expected to reduce incidental mortality or 
serious injury of marine mammals;
    (D) A description of the applicability of this modification to other 
purse seine vessels;
    (E) The planned design, time, duration, and general area of the 
experimental operation;
    (F) The name(s) of the permitted operator(s) of the vessel(s) during 
the experiment;
    (G) A statement of the qualifications of the individual or company 
doing the analysis of the research; and
    (H) Signature of the permitted operator or of the operator's 
representative.
    (ii) The Administrator, Southwest Region, will acknowledge receipt 
of the application and, upon determining that it is complete, will 
publish a notice in the Federal Register summarizing the application, 
making the full application available for inspection and inviting 
comments for a minimum period of 30 days from the date of publication.
    (iii) The Administrator, Southwest Region, after considering the 
information submitted in the application identified in paragraph 
(c)(7)(i) of this section and the comments received, will either issue a 
waiver to conduct the experiment that includes restrictions or 
conditions deemed appropriate, or deny the application, giving the 
reasons for denial.
    (iv) A waiver for an experimental fishing operation will be valid 
only for the vessels and operators named in the permit, for the time 
period and areas specified, for trips carrying an observer designated by 
the Administrator, Southwest Region, and when all the terms and 
conditions of the permit are met.
    (v) The Administrator, Southwest Region, may suspend or revoke an 
experimental fishing waiver in accordance with 15 CFR part 904 if the 
terms and conditions of the waiver or the provisions of the regulations 
are not followed.
    (8) Operator permit holder performance requirements. [Reserved]
    (9) Vessel permit holder dolphin mortality limits. For purposes of 
this paragraph, the term ``vessel permit holder'' includes both the 
holder of a current vessel permit and also the holder of a vessel permit 
for the following year.
    (i) By September 1 each year, a vessel permit holder desiring a DML 
for the following year must provide to the Administrator, Southwest 
Region, the name of the U.S. purse seine fishing vessel(s) of carrying 
capacity greater than 400 st (362.8 mt) that the owner intends to use to 
intentionally deploy purse seine fishing nets in the ETP to encircle 
dolphins in an effort to capture tuna during the following year. NMFS 
will forward the list of purse seine vessels to the Director of the 
IATTC on or before October 1, or as otherwise required by the IDCP, for 
assignment of a DML for the following year under the provisions of Annex 
IV of the Agreement on the IDCP.
    (ii) Each vessel permit holder that desires a DML only for the 
period between July 1 to December 31 must provide the Administrator, 
Southwest Region, by September 1 of the prior year, the name of the U.S. 
purse seine fishing vessel(s) of greater than 400 st (362.8 mt) carrying 
capacity that the owner intends to use to intentionally deploy purse 
seine fishing nets in the ETP to encircle dolphins in an effort to 
capture tuna during the period. NMFS will forward the list of purse 
seine vessels to the Director of the IATTC on or before October 1, or as 
otherwise required under the IDCP, for possible assignment of a DML for 
the 6-month period July 1 to December 31. Under the IDCP, the DML will 
be calculated by the IDCP from any unutilized pool of DMLs in accordance 
with the procedure described in Annex IV of the Agreement

[[Page 28]]

on the IDCP and will not exceed one-half of an unadjusted full-year DML 
as calculated by the IDCP.
    (iii)(A) The Administrator, Southwest Region, will notify vessel 
owners of the DML assigned for each vessel for the following year, or 
the second half of the year, as applicable.
    (B) The Administrator, Southwest Region, may adjust the DMLs in 
accordance with Annex IV of the Agreement on the IDCP. All adjustments 
of full-year DMLs will be made before January 1, and the Administrator, 
Southwest Region, will notify the Director of the IATTC of any 
adjustments prior to a vessel departing on a trip using its adjusted 
DML. The notification will be no later than February 1 in the case of 
adjustments to full-year DMLs, and no later than May 1 in the case of 
adjustments to DMLs for the second half of the year.
    (C) In accordance with the requirements of Annex IV of the Agreement 
on the IDCP, the Administrator, Southwest Region, may adjust a vessel's 
DML if it will further scientific or technological advancement in the 
protection of marine mammals in the fishery or if the past performance 
of the vessel indicates that the protection or use of the yellowfin tuna 
stocks or marine mammals is best served by the adjustment, within the 
mandates of the MMPA. Experimental fishing operation waivers or 
scientific research permits will be considered a basis for adjustments.
    (iv)(A) A vessel assigned a full-year DML that does not make a set 
on dolphins by April 1 or that leaves the fishery will lose its DML for 
the remainder of the year, unless the failure to set on dolphins is due 
to force majeure or other extraordinary circumstances as determined by 
the International Review Panel.
    (B) A vessel assigned a DML for the second half of the year will be 
considered to have lost its DML if the vessel has not made a set on 
dolphins before December 31, unless the failure to set on dolphins is 
due to force majeure or extraordinary circumstances as determined by the 
International Review Panel.
    (C) Any vessel that loses its DML for 2 consecutive years will not 
be eligible to receive a DML for the following year.
    (D) NMFS will determine, based on available information, whether a 
vessel has left the fishery.
    (1) A vessel lost at sea, undergoing extensive repairs, operating in 
an ocean area other than the ETP, or for which other information 
indicates that vessel will no longer be conducting purse seine 
operations in the ETP for the remainder of the period covered by the DML 
will be determined to have left the fishery.
    (2) NMFS will make all reasonable efforts to determine the 
intentions of the vessel owner. The owner of any vessel that has been 
preliminarily determined to have left the fishery will be provided 
notice of such preliminary determination and given the opportunity to 
provide information on whether the vessel has left the fishery prior to 
NMFS making a final determination under 15 CFR part 904 and notifying 
the IATTC.
    (v) Any vessel that exceeds its assigned DML after any applicable 
adjustment under paragraph (c)(9)(iii) of this section will have its DML 
for the subsequent year reduced by 150 percent of the overage, unless 
another adjustment is determined by the International Review Panel, as 
mandated by the Agreement on the IDCP.
    (vi) A vessel that is covered by a valid vessel permit and that does 
not normally fish for tuna in the ETP but desires to participate in the 
fishery on a limited basis may apply for a per-trip DML from the 
Administrator, Southwest Region, at any time, allowing at least 60 days 
for processing. The request must state the expected number of trips 
involving sets on dolphins and the anticipated dates of the trip or 
trips. The request will be forwarded to the Secretariat of the IATTC for 
processing in accordance with Annex IV of the Agreement on the IDCP. A 
per-trip DML will be assigned if one is made available in accordance 
with the terms of Annex IV of the Agreement on the IDCP. If a vessel 
assigned a per-trip DML does not set on dolphins during that trip, the 
vessel will be considered to have lost its DML unless this was a result 
of force majeure or other extraordinary circumstances as determined by 
the International Review

[[Page 29]]

Panel. After two consecutive losses of a DML, a vessel will not be 
eligible to receive a DML for the next fishing year.
    (vii) Observers will make their records available to the vessel 
operator at any reasonable time, including after each set, in order for 
the operator to monitor the balance of the DML(s) remaining for use.
    (viii) Vessel and operator permit holders must not deploy a purse 
seine net on or encircle any school of dolphins containing individuals 
of a particular stock of dolphins for the remainder of the calendar 
year:
    (A) after the applicable per-stock per-year dolphin mortality limit 
for that stock of dolphins (or for that vessel, if so assigned) has been 
reached or exceeded; or
    (B) after the time and date provided in actual notification or 
notification in the Federal Register by the Administrator, Southwest 
Region, based upon the best available evidence, stating when any 
applicable per-stock per-year dolphin mortality limit has been reached 
or exceeded, or is expected to be reached in the near future.
    (ix) If individual dolphins belonging to a stock that is prohibited 
from being taken are not reasonably observable at the time the net skiff 
attached to the net is released from the vessel at the start of a set, 
the fact that individuals of that stock are subsequently taken will not 
be cause for enforcement action provided that all procedures required by 
the applicable regulations have been followed.
    (x) Vessel and operator permit holders must not intentionally deploy 
a purse seine net on or encircle dolphins intentionally:
    (A) after a set in which the vessel's DML, as adjusted, has been 
reached or exceeded; or
    (B) after the date and time provided in actual notification by 
letter, facsimile, radio, or electronic mail, or notice in the Federal 
Register by the Administrator, Southwest Region, based upon the best 
available evidence, that intentional sets on dolphins must cease because 
the total of the DMLs assigned to the U.S. fleet has been reached or 
exceeded, or is expected to be exceeded in the near future.
    (d) Purse seining by vessels without assigned DMLs. In addition to 
the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, a vessel permit used 
for a trip not involving an assigned DML and the operator's permit when 
used on such a vessel are subject to the following terms and conditions: 
a permit holder may take marine mammals provided that such taking is an 
accidental occurrence in the course of normal commercial fishing 
operations and the vessel does not intentionally deploy its net on, or 
to encircle, dolphins; marine mammals taken incidental to such 
commercial fishing operations must be immediately returned to the 
environment where captured without further injury, using release 
procedures such as hand rescue, or aborting the set at the earliest 
effective opportunity; and the use of one or more rafts and facemasks or 
viewboxes to aid in the rescue of dolphins is recommended.
    (e) Observers--(1) The holder of a vessel permit must allow an 
observer duly authorized by the Administrator, Southwest Region, to 
accompany the vessel on all fishing trips in the ETP for the purpose of 
conducting research and observing operations, including collecting 
information that may be used in civil or criminal penalty proceedings, 
forfeiture actions, or permit sanctions. A vessel that fails to carry an 
observer in accordance with these requirements may not engage in fishing 
operations.
    (2) Research and observation duties will be carried out in such a 
manner as to minimize interference with commercial fishing operations. 
Observers must be provided access to vessel personnel and to dolphin 
safety gear and equipment, electronic navigation equipment, radar 
displays, high powered binoculars, and electronic communication 
equipment. The navigator must provide true vessel locations by latitude 
and longitude, accurate to the nearest minute, upon request by the 
observer. Observers must be provided with adequate space on the bridge 
or pilothouse for clerical work, as well as space on deck adequate for 
carrying out observer duties. No vessel owner, master, operator, or crew 
member of a permitted vessel may impair, or in any

[[Page 30]]

way interfere with, the research or observations being carried out. 
Masters must allow observers to use vessel communication equipment 
necessary to report information concerning the take of marine mammals 
and other observer collected data upon request of the observer.
    (3) Any marine mammals killed during fishing operations that are 
accessible to crewmen and requested from the permit holder or master by 
the observer must be brought aboard the vessel and retained for 
biological processing, until released by the observer for return to the 
ocean. Whole marine mammals or marine mammal parts designated as 
biological specimens by the observer must be retained in cold storage 
aboard the vessel until retrieved by authorized personnel of NMFS or the 
IATTC when the vessel returns to port for unloading.
    (4) It is unlawful for any person to forcibly assault, impede, 
intimidate, interfere with, or to influence or attempt to influence an 
observer, or to harass (including sexual harassment) an observer by 
conduct that has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with 
the observer's work performance, or that creates an intimidating, 
hostile, or offensive environment. In determining whether conduct 
constitutes harassment, the totality of the circumstances, including the 
nature of the conduct and the context in which it occurred, will be 
considered. The determination of the legality of a particular action 
will be made from the facts on a case-by-case basis.
    (5)(i) All observers must be provided sleeping, toilet and eating 
accommodations at least equal to that provided to a full crew member. A 
mattress or futon on the floor or a cot is not acceptable in place of a 
regular bunk. Meal and other galley privileges must be the same for the 
observer as for other crew members.
    (ii) Female observers on a vessel with an all-male crew must be 
accommodated either in a single-person cabin or, if reasonable privacy 
can be ensured by installing a curtain or other temporary divider, in a 
two-person cabin shared with a licensed officer of the vessel. If the 
cabin assigned to a female observer does not have its own toilet and 
shower facilities that can be provided for the exclusive use of the 
observer, then a schedule for time-sharing common facilities must be 
established before the placement meeting and approved by NMFS or other 
approved observer program and must be followed during the entire trip.
    (iii) In the event there are one or more female crew members, the 
female observer must be provided a bunk in a cabin shared solely with 
female crew members, and provided toilet and shower facilities shared 
solely with these female crew members.
    (f) Importation, purchase, shipment, sale and transport. (1)(i) It 
is illegal to import into the United States any fish, whether fresh, 
frozen, or otherwise prepared, if the fish have been caught with 
commercial fishing technology that results in the incidental kill or 
incidental serious injury of marine mammals in excess of that allowed 
under this part for U.S. fishermen, or as specified at paragraph (f)(6) 
of this section.
    (ii) For purposes of this paragraph (f), and in applying the 
definition of an ``intermediary nation,'' an import occurs when the fish 
or fish product is released from a nation's Customs' custody and enters 
into the commerce of the nation. For other purposes, ``import'' is 
defined in Sec. 216.3.
    (2) Imports requiring a Fisheries Certificate of Origin. Shipments 
of tuna, tuna products, and certain other fish products identified by 
the U.S. Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) numbers listed in paragraphs 
(f)(2)(i), (f)(2)(ii) and (f)(2)(iii) of this section may not be 
imported into the United States unless a properly completed Fisheries 
Certificate of Origin (FCO), NOAA Form 370, is filed with the U.S. 
Customs Service at the time of importation.
    (i) HTS numbers requiring a Fisheries Certificate of Origin, subject 
to yellowfin tuna embargo. The following HTS numbers identify yellowfin 
tuna or yellowfin tuna products (other than fresh tuna) known to be 
imported into the United States. All shipments imported into the United 
States under these HTS numbers must be accompanied by an FCO. The scope 
of yellowfin tuna embargoes and procedures for attaining an affirmative 
finding are described

    (3) Disposition of Fisheries Certificates of Origin. The FCO 
described in paragraph (f)(4) of this section may be obtained from the 
Administrator, Southwest Region, or downloaded from the Internet at 
http://swr.nmfs.noaa.gov/noaa370.htm.
    (i) A properly completed FCO and its attached certificates, if 
applicable, must accompany the required U.S. Customs entry documents 
that are filed at the time of import.
    (ii) FCOs and associated certifications, if any, that accompany 
imported shipments of tuna must be submitted by the importer of record 
to the Tuna Tracking and Verification Program, Southwest Region, within 
30 days of the shipment's entry into the commerce of the United States. 
FCOs submitted via mail should be sent to Tuna Tracking and Verification 
Program, Southwest Region, P.O. Box 32469, Long Beach, CA 90832-2469. 
Copies of the documents may be submitted electronically using a secure 
file transfer protocol (FTP) site. Importers of record interested in 
submitting FCOs and associated certifications via FTP may contact a 
representative of the Tuna Tracking and Verification Program at the 
following email address: SWRTuna.Track@noaa.gov. The Tuna Tracking and 
Verification Program will facilitate secure transfer and protection of 
certifications by assigning a separate electronic folder for each 
importer. Access to the electronic folder will require a user 
identification and password. The Tuna Tracking and Verification Program 
will assign each importer a unique user identification and password. 
Safeguarding the confidentiality of the user identification and password 
is the responsibility of the importer to whom they are assigned. Copies 
of the documents may also be submitted via mail either on compact disc 
or as hard copies. All electronic submissions, whether via FTP or on 
compact disc, must be in either Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) or 
as an image file embedded in a Microsoft Word, Microsoft PowerPoint, or 
Corel WordPerfect file.
    (iii) FCOs that accompany imported shipments of tuna destined for 
further processing in the United States must be endorsed at each change 
in ownership and submitted to the Administrator, Southwest Region, by 
the last endorser when all required endorsements are completed.
    (iv) Importers and exporters are required to retain their records, 
including FCOs, import or export documents, invoices, and bills of 
lading for 2 years, and such records must be made available within 30 
days of a request by the Secretary or the Administrator, Southwest 
Region.
    (4) Contents of Fisheries Certificate of Origin. An FCO, certified 
to be accurate by the exporter(s) of the accompanying shipment, must 
include the following information:
    (i) Customs entry identification;
    (ii) Date of entry;
    (iii) Exporter's full name and complete address;

[[Page 33]]

    (iv) Importer's or consignee's full name and complete address;
    (v) Species description, product form, and HTS number;
    (vi) Total net weight of the shipment in kilograms;
    (vii) Ocean area where the fish were harvested (ETP, western Pacific 
Ocean, south Pacific Ocean, eastern Atlantic Ocean, western Atlantic 
Ocean, Caribbean Sea, Indian Ocean, or other);
    (viii) Type of fishing gear used to harvest the fish (purse seine, 
longline, baitboat, large-scale driftnet, gillnet, trawl, pole and line, 
or other);
    (ix) Country under whose laws the harvesting vessel operated based 
upon the flag of the vessel or, if a certified charter vessel, the 
country that accepted responsibility for the vessel's fishing 
operations;
    (x) Dates on which the fishing trip began and ended;
    (xi) The name of the harvesting vessel;
    (xii) Dolphin-safe condition of the shipment, described by checking 
the appropriate statement on the form and attaching additional 
certifications if required;
    (xiii) For shipments harvested by vessels of a nation known to use 
large-scale driftnets, as determined by the Secretary pursuant to 
paragraph (f)(7) of this section, the High Seas Driftnet Certification 
contained on the FCO must be dated and signed by a responsible 
government official of the harvesting nation, certifying that the fish 
or fish products were harvested by a method other than large-scale 
driftnet; and
    (xiv) Each additional importer, exporter, or processor who takes 
custody of the shipment must sign and date the form to certify that the 
form and attached documentation accurately describes the shipment of 
fish that they accompany.
    (5) Dolphin-safe label. Tuna or tuna products sold in or exported 
from the United States that include on the label the term ``dolphin-
safe'' or any other term or symbol that claims or suggests the tuna were 
harvested in a manner not injurious to dolphins are subject to the 
requirements of subpart H of this part (Sec. 216.90 et seq.).
    (6) Scope of embargoes--(i) ETP yellowfin tuna embargo. Yellowfin 
tuna or products of yellowfin tuna harvested using a purse seine in the 
ETP identified by an HTS number listed in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this 
section may not be imported into the United States if such tuna or tuna 
products were:
    (A) Harvested on or after March 3, 1999, the effective date of 
section 4 of the IDCPA, and harvested by, or exported from, a nation 
that the Assistant Administrator has determined has jurisdiction over 
purse seine vessels of greater than 400 st (362.8 mt) carrying capacity 
harvesting tuna in the ETP, unless the Assistant Administrator has made 
an affirmative finding required for importation for that nation under 
paragraph (f)(8) of this section;
    (B) Exported from an intermediary nation, as defined in Section 3 of 
the MMPA, and a ban is currently in force prohibiting the importation 
from that nation under paragraph (f)(9) of this section; or
    (C) Harvested before March 3, 1999, the effective date of Section 4 
of the IDCPA, and would have been banned from importation under Section 
101(a)(2) of the MMPA at the time of harvest.
    (ii) Driftnet embargo. A shipment containing fish or fish products 
identified by an HTS number listed in paragraph (f)(2) of this section 
may not be imported into the United States if it is harvested by a 
large-scale driftnet, or if it is exported from or harvested on the high 
seas by any nation determined by the Assistant Administrator to be 
engaged in large-scale driftnet fishing, unless a government official of 
the large-scale driftnet nation completes, signs and dates the High Seas 
Driftnet section of the FCO certifying that the fish or fish products 
were harvested by a method other than large-scale driftnet.
    (iii) Pelly certification. After 6 months of an embargo being in 
place against a nation under this section, the Secretary will certify 
that nation under section 8(a) of the Fishermen's Protective Act (22 
U.S.C. 1978(a)). When such an embargo is lifted, the Secretary will 
terminate the certification under Section 8(d) of that Act (22 U.S.C. 
1978(d)).

[[Page 34]]

    (iv) Coordination. The Assistant Administrator will promptly advise 
the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security of 
embargo decisions, actions, and finding determinations.
    (7) Large-scale driftnet nation: determination. Based upon the best 
information available, the Assistant Administrator will determine which 
nations have registered vessels that engage in fishing using large-scale 
driftnets. Such determinations will be published in the Federal 
Register. A responsible government official of any such nation may 
certify to the Assistant Administrator that none of the nation's vessels 
use large-scale driftnets. Upon receipt of the certification, the 
Assistant Administrator may find, and publish such finding in the 
Federal Register, that none of that nation's vessels engage in fishing 
with large-scale driftnets.
    (8) Affirmative finding procedure for nations harvesting yellowfin 
tuna using a purse seine in the ETP. (i) The Assistant Administrator 
will determine, on an annual basis, whether to make an affirmative 
finding based upon documentary evidence provided by the government of 
the harvesting nation or by the IDCP and the IATTC, and will publish the 
finding in the Federal Register. A finding will remain valid for 1 year 
or for such other period as the Assistant Administrator may determine. 
An affirmative finding will be terminated if the Assistant Administrator 
determines that the requirements of this paragraph are no longer being 
met. Every 5 years, the government of the harvesting nation must submit 
such documentary evidence directly to the Assistant Administrator and 
request an affirmative finding. Documentary evidence must be submitted 
by the harvesting nation for the first affirmative finding application. 
The Assistant Administrator may require the submission of supporting 
documentation or other verification of statements made in connection 
with requests to allow importations. An affirmative finding applies to 
yellowfin tuna and yellowfin tuna products that were harvested by 
vessels of the nation after March 3, 1999. To make an affirmative 
finding, the Assistant Administrator must find that:
    (A) The harvesting nation participates in the IDCP and is either a 
member of the IATTC or has initiated (and within 6 months thereafter 
completed) all steps required of applicant nations, in accordance with 
article V, paragraph 3, of the Convention establishing the IATTC, to 
become a member of that organization;
    (B) The nation is meeting its obligations under the IDCP and its 
obligations of membership in the IATTC, including all financial 
obligations;
    (C)(1) The annual total dolphin mortality of the nation's purse 
seine fleet (including certified charter vessels operating under its 
jurisdiction) did not exceed the aggregated total of the mortality 
limits assigned by the IDCP for that nation's purse seine vessels for 
the year preceding the year in which the finding would start; or
    (2)(i) Because of extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of 
the nation and the vessel captains, the total dolphin mortality of the 
nation's purse seine fleet (including certified charter vessels 
operating under its jurisdiction) exceeded the aggregated total of the 
mortality limits assigned by the IDCP for that nation's purse seine 
vessels; and
    (ii) Immediately after the national authorities discovered the 
aggregate mortality of its fleet had been exceeded, the nation required 
all its vessels to cease fishing for tuna in association with dolphins 
for the remainder of the calendar year; and
    (D)(1) In any years in which the parties agree to a global 
allocation system for per-stock per-year individual stock quotas, the 
nation responded to the notification from the IATTC that an individual 
stock quota had been reached by prohibiting any additional sets on the 
stock for which the quota had been reached;
    (2) If a per-stock per-year quota is allocated to each nation, the 
annual per-stock per-year dolphin mortality of the nation's purse seine 
fleet (including certified charter vessels operating under its 
jurisdiction) did not exceed the aggregated total of the per-stock per-
year limits assigned by the IDCP for that nation's purse seine vessels 
(if

[[Page 35]]

any) for the year preceding the year in which the finding would start; 
or
    (3)(i) Because of extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of 
the nation and the vessel captains, the per-stock per-year dolphin 
mortality of the nation's purse seine fleet (including certified charter 
vessels operating under its jurisdiction) exceeded the aggregated total 
of the per-stock per-year limits assigned by the IDCP for that nation's 
purse seine vessels; and
    (ii) Immediately after the national authorities discovered the 
aggregate per-stock mortality limits of its fleet had been exceeded, the 
nation required all its vessels to cease fishing for tuna in association 
with the stocks whose limits had been exceeded, for the remainder of the 
calendar year.
    (iii) Documentary Evidence and Compliance with the IDCP--(A) 
Documentary Evidence. The Assistant Administrator will make an 
affirmative finding under paragraph (f)(8)(i) of this section only if 
the government of the harvesting nation provides directly to the 
Assistant Administrator, or authorizes the IATTC to release to the 
Assistant Administrator, complete, accurate, and timely information that 
enables the Assistant Administrator to determine whether the harvesting 
nation is meeting the obligations of the IDCP, and whether ETP-harvested 
tuna imported from such nation comports with the tracking and 
verification regulations of subpart H of this part.
    (B) Revocation. After considering the information provided under 
paragraph (f)(8)(ii)(A) of this section, each party's financial 
obligations to the IATTC, and any other relevant information, including 
information that a nation is consistently failing to take enforcement 
actions on violations that diminish the effectiveness of the IDCP, the 
Assistant Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of State, 
will revoke an affirmative finding issued to a nation that is not 
meeting the obligations of the IDCP.
    (iv) A harvesting nation may apply for an affirmative finding at any 
time by providing to the Assistant Administrator the information and 
authorizations required in paragraphs (f)(8)(i) and (f)(8)(ii) of this 
section, allowing at least 60 days from the submission of complete 
information to NMFS for processing.
    (v) The Assistant Administrator will make or renew an affirmative 
finding for the period from April 1 through March 31 of the following 
year, or portion thereof, if the harvesting nation has provided all the 
information and authorizations required by paragraphs (f)(8)(i) and 
(f)(8)(ii) of this section, and has met the requirements of paragraphs 
(f)(8)(i) and (f)(8)(ii) of this section.
    (vi) Reconsideration of finding. The Assistant Administrator may 
reconsider a finding upon a request from, and the submission of 
additional information by, the harvesting nation, if the information 
indicates that the nation has met the requirements under paragraphs 
(f)(8)(i) and (f)(8)(ii) of this section.
    (9) Intermediary nation. Except as authorized under this paragraph, 
no yellowfin tuna or yellowfin tuna products harvested by purse seine in 
the ETP classified under one of the HTS numbers listed in paragraph 
(f)(2)(i) of this section may be imported into the United States from 
any intermediary nation.
    (i) An ``intermediary nation'' is a nation that exports yellowfin 
tuna or yellowfin tuna products to the United States and that imports 
yellowfin tuna or yellowfin tuna products that are subject to a direct 
ban on importation into the United States pursuant to Section 
101(a)(2)(B) of the MMPA.
    (ii) Shipments of yellowfin tuna that pass through any nation (e.g. 
on a 'through Bill of Lading') and are not entered for consumption in 
that nation are not considered to be imports to that nation and thus, 
would not cause that nation to be considered an intermediary nation 
under the MMPA.
    (iii) The Assistant Administrator will publish in the Federal 
Register a notice announcing when NMFS has determined, based on the best 
information available, that a nation is an ``intermediary nation.'' 
After the effective date of that notice, the import restrictions of this 
paragraph shall apply.
    (iv) Changing the status of intermediary nation determinations. 
Imports

[[Page 36]]

from an intermediary nation of yellowfin tuna and yellowfin tuna 
products classified under any of the HTS numbers in paragraph (f)(2)(i) 
of this section may be imported into the United States only if the 
Assistant Administrator determines, and publishes a notice of such 
determination in the Federal Register, that the intermediary nation has 
provided certification and reasonable proof that it has not imported in 
the preceding 6 months yellowfin tuna or yellowfin tuna products that 
are subject to a ban on direct importation into the United States under 
Section 101(a)(2)(B) of the MMPA. At that time, the nation shall no 
longer be considered an ``intermediary nation'' and these import 
restrictions shall no longer apply.
    (v) The Assistant Administrator will review decisions under this 
paragraph upon the request of an intermediary nation. Such requests must 
be accompanied by specific and detailed supporting information or 
documentation indicating that a review or reconsideration is warranted. 
For purposes of this paragraph, the term ``certification and reasonable

Sec. 216.27  Release, non-releasability, and disposition under special
exception permits for rehabilitated marine mammals.

    (a) Release requirements. (1) Any marine mammal held for 
rehabilitation must be released within six months of capture or import 
unless the attending veterinarian determines that:
    (i) The marine mammal might adversely affect marine mammals in the 
wild;
    (ii) Release of the marine mammal to the wild will not likely be 
successful given the physical condition and behavior of the marine 
mammal; or
    (iii) More time is needed to determine whether the release of the 
marine mammal to the wild will likely be successful. Releasability must 
be reevaluated at intervals of no less than six months until 24 months 
from capture or import, at which time there will be a rebuttable 
presumption that release into the wild is not feasible.
    (2) The custodian of the rehabilitated marine mammal shall provide 
written notification prior to any release into the wild.
    (i) Notification shall be provided to:
    (A) The NMFS Regional Director at least 15 days in advance of 
releasing any beached or stranded marine mammal, unless advance notice 
is waived in writing by the Regional Director; or
    (B) The Office Director at least 30 days in advance of releasing any 
imported marine mammal.
    (ii) Notification shall include the following:
    (A) A description of the marine mammal, including its physical 
condition and estimated age;
    (B) The date and location of release; and
    (C) The method and duration of transport prior to release.
    (3) The Regional Director, or the Office Director as appropriate, 
may:
    (i) Require additional information prior to any release;

[[Page 38]]

    (ii) Change the date or location of release, or the method or 
duration of transport prior to release;
    (iii) Impose additional conditions to improve the likelihood of 
success or to monitor the success of the release; or
    (iv) Require other disposition of the marine mammal.
    (4) All marine mammals must be released near wild populations of the 
same species, and stock if known, unless a waiver is granted by the 
Regional Director or the Office Director.
    (5) All marine mammals released must be tagged or marked in a manner 
acceptable to the Regional Director or the Office Director. The tag 
number or description of the marking must be reported to the Regional 
Director or Office Director following release.
    (b) Non-releasability and postponed determinations. (1) The 
attending veterinarian shall provide the Regional Director or Office 
Director with a written report setting forth the basis of any 
determination under paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section.
    (2) Upon receipt of a report under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, 
the Regional Director or Office Director, in their sole discretion, may:
    (i) Order the release of the marine mammal;
    (ii) Order continued rehabilitation for an additional 6 months; or
    (iii) Order other disposition as authorized.
    (3) No later than 30 days after a marine mammal is determined 
unreleasable in accordance with paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iii) of 
this section, the person with authorized custody must:
    (i) Request authorization to retain or transfer custody of the 
marine mammal in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, or;
    (ii) Humanely euthanize the marine mammal or arrange any other 
disposition of the marine mammal authorized by the Regional Director or 
Office Director.
    (4) Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this section, the 
Office Director may require use of a rehabilitated marine mammal for any 
activity authorized under subpart D in lieu of animals taken from the 
wild.
    (5) Any rehabilitated beached or stranded marine mammal placed on 
public display following a non-releasability determination under 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section and pending disposition under paragraph 
(c) of this section, or any marine mammal imported for medical treatment 
otherwise unavailable and placed on public display pending disposition 
after such medical treatment is concluded, must be held in captive 
maintenance consistent with all requirements for public display.
    (c) Disposition for a special exception purpose. (1) Upon receipt of 
an authorization request made under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, 
or release notification under (a)(2), the Office Director may authorize 
the retention or transfer of custody of the marine mammal for a special 
exception purpose authorized under subpart D.
    (2) The Office Director will first consider requests from a person 
authorized to hold the marine mammal for rehabilitation. The Office 
Director may authorize such person to retain or transfer custody of the 
marine mammal for scientific research, enhancement, or public display 
purposes.
    (3) The Office Director may authorize retention or transfer of 
custody of the marine mammal only if:
    (i) Documentation has been submitted to the Office Director that the 
person retaining the subject animal or the person receiving custody of 
the subject animal by transfer, hereinafter referred to as the 
recipient, complies with public display requirements of 16 U.S.C.

holds an applicable permit, or an application for such a special 
exception permit under Sec. 216.33 or a request for a major amendment 
under Sec. 216.39 has been submitted to the Office Director and has 
been found complete;
    (ii) The recipient agrees to hold the marine mammal in conformance 
with all applicable requirements and standards; and
    (iii) The recipient acknowledges that the marine mammal is subject 
to seizure by the Office Director:
    (A) If, at any time pending issuance of the major amendment or 
permit, the Office Director determines that seizure

[[Page 39]]

is necessary in the interest of the health or welfare of the marine 
mammal;
    (B) If the major amendment or permit is denied; or
    (C) If the recipient is issued a notice of violation and assessment, 
or is subject to permit sanctions, in accordance with 15 CFR part 904.
    (4) There shall be no remuneration associated with any transfer, 
provided that, the transferee may reimburse the transferor for any and 
all costs associated with the rehabilitation and transport of the marine 
mammal.
    (5) Marine mammals undergoing rehabilitation or pending disposition 
under this section shall not be subject to public display, unless such 
activities are specifically authorized by the Regional Director or the 
Office Director, and conducted consistent with the requirements 
applicable to public display. Such marine mammals shall not be trained 
for performance or be included in any aspect of a program involving 
interaction with the public; and
    (6) Marine mammals undergoing rehabilitation shall not be subject to 
intrusive research, unless such activities are specifically authorized 
by the Office Director in consultation with the Marine Mammal Commission 
and its Committee of Scientific Advisors on Marine Mammals, and are 
conducted pursuant to a scientific research permit.
    (d) Reporting. In addition to the report required under Sec. 
216.22(b), the person authorized to hold marine mammals for 
rehabilitation must submit reports to the Regional Director or Office 
Director regarding release or other disposition. These reports must be

corporation responsible for supervision of the principal investigator.
    (2) For any scientific research involving captive maintenance, the 
application must include supporting documentation from the person 
responsible for the facility or other temporary enclosure.
    (b) Issuance Criteria. For the Office Director to issue any 
scientific research or enhancement permit, the applicant must 
demonstrate that:
    (1) The proposed activity furthers a bona fide scientific or 
enhancement purpose;
    (2) If the lethal taking of marine mammals is proposed:
    (i) Non-lethal methods for conducting the research are not feasible; 
and
    (ii) For depleted, endangered, or threatened species, the results 
will directly benefit that species or stock, or will fulfill a 
critically important research need.
    (3) Any permanent removal of a marine mammal from the wild is 
consistent with any applicable quota established by the Office Director.
    (4) The proposed research will not likely have significant adverse 
effects on any other component of the marine ecosystem of which the 
affected species or stock is a part.
    (5) For species or stocks designated or proposed to be designated as 
depleted, or listed or proposed to be listed as endangered or 
threatened:
    (i) The proposed research cannot be accomplished using a species or 
stock that is not designated or proposed to be designated as depleted, 
or listed or proposed to be listed as threatened or endangered;
    (ii) The proposed research, by itself or in combination with other 
activities will not likely have a long-term direct or indirect adverse 
impact on the species or stock;
    (iii) The proposed research will either:

[[Page 46]]

    (A) Contribute to fulfilling a research need or objective identified 
in a species recovery or conservation plan, or if there is no 
conservation or recovery plan in place, a research need or objective 
identified by the Office Director in stock assessments established under 
section 117 of the MMPA;
    (B) Contribute significantly to understanding the basic biology or 
ecology of the species or stock, or to identifying, evaluating, or 
resolving conservation problems for the species or stock; or
    (C) Contribute significantly to fulfilling a critically important 
research need.
    (6) For proposed enhancement activities:
    (i) Only living marine mammals and marine mammal parts necessary for 
enhancement of the survival, recovery, or propagation of the affected 
species or stock may be taken, imported, exported, or otherwise affected 
under the authority of an enhancement permit. Marine mammal parts would 
include in this regard clinical specimens or other biological samples 
required for the conduct of breeding programs or the diagnosis or 
treatment of disease.
    (ii) The activity will likely contribute significantly to 
maintaining or increasing distribution or abundance, enhancing the 
health or welfare of the species or stock, or ensuring the survival or 
recovery of the affected species or stock in the wild.

    (B) If there is no conservation or recovery plan, with the Office 
Director's evaluation of the actions required to enhance the survival or 
recovery of the species or stock in light of the factors that would be 
addressed in a conservation or recovery plan.
    (iv) An enhancement permit may authorize the captive maintenance of 
a marine mammal from a threatened, endangered, or depleted species or 
stock only if the Office Director determines that:
    (A) The proposed captive maintenance will likely contribute directly 
to the survival or recovery of the species or stock by maintaining a 
viable gene pool, increasing productivity, providing necessary 
biological information, or establishing animal reserves required to 
support directly these objectives; and
    (B) The expected benefit to the species or stock outweighs the 
expected benefits of alternatives that do not require removal of marine 
mammals from the wild.
    (v) The Office Director may authorize the public display of marine 
mammals held under the authority of an enhancement permit only if:
    (A) The public display is incidental to the authorized captive 
maintenance;

in number and limited to:
    (A) Individuals who perform a function directly supportive of and 
necessary to the permitted research activity; and
    (B) Support personnel included for the purpose of training or as 
backup personnel for persons described in paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(A).
    (v) Any marine mammal part imported under the authority of a 
scientific research permit must not have been obtained as the result of 
a lethal taking that would be inconsistent with the Acts, unless 
authorized by the Office Director.
    (vi) Marine mammals held under a permit for scientific research 
shall not be placed on public display, included in an interactive 
program or activity, or trained for performance unless such activities:
    (A) Are necessary to address scientific research objectives and have

Sec. 216.71  Allowable take of fur seals.

    Pribilovians may take fur seals on the Pribilof Islands if such 
taking is
    (a) For subsistence uses, and
    (b) Not accomplished in a wasteful manner.

Sec. 216.72  Restrictions on taking.

    (a) The harvests of seals on St. Paul and St. George Islands shall 
be treated independently for the purposes of this section. Any 
suspension, termination, or extension of the harvest is applicable only 
to the island for which it is issued.
    (b) By April 1 of every third year, beginning April 1994, the 
Assistant Administrator will publish in the Federal Register a summary 
of the preceding 3 years of harvesting and a discussion of the number of 
seals expected to be taken annually over the next 3

[[Page 53]]

years to satisfy the subsistence requirements of each island. This 
discussion will include an assessment of factors and conditions on St. 
Paul and St. George Islands that influence the need by Pribilof Aleuts 
to take seals for subsistence uses and an assessment of any changes to 
those conditions indicating that the number of seals that may be taken 
for subsistence each year should be made higher or lower. Following a 
30-day public comment period, a final notification of the expected 
annual harvest levels for the next 3 years will be published.
    (c)(1) No fur seal may be taken on the Pribilof Islands before June 
23 of each year.
    (2) No fur seal may be taken except by experienced sealers using the 
traditional harvesting methods, including stunning followed immediately 
by exsanguination. The harvesting method shall include organized drives 
of subadult males to killing fields unless it is determined by the NMFS 
representatives, in consultation with the Pribilovians conducting the 
harvest, that alternative methods will not result in increased 
disturbance to the rookery or the increased accidental take of female 
seals.
    (3) Any taking of adult fur seals or pups, or the intentional taking 
of subadult female fur seals is prohibited.
    (4) Only subadult male fur seals 124.5 centimeters or less in length 
may be taken.
    (5) Seals with tags and/or entangling debris may only be taken if so 
directed by NMFS scientists.
    (d) The scheduling of the harvest is at the discretion of the 
Pribilovians, but must be such as to minimize stress to the harvested 
seals. The Pribilovians must give adequate advance notice of their 
harvest schedules to the NMFS representatives to allow for necessary 
monitoring activities. Scheduling must be consistent with the following 
restrictions:
    (1) St. Paul Island--Seals may only be harvested from the following 
haulout areas: Zapadni, English Bay, Northeast Point, Polovina, Lukanin, 
Kitovi, and Reef. No haulout area may be harvested more than once per 
week.
    (2) St. George Island--Seals may only be harvested from the 
following haulout areas: Northeast and Zapadni. Neither haulout area may 
be harvested more than twice per week.
    (e)(1) The Assistant Administrator is required to suspend the take 
provided for in Sec. 215.31 when:
    (i) He determines, after reasonable notice by NMFS representatives 
to the Pribilovians on the island, that the subsistence needs of the 
Pribilovians on the island have been satisfied;

or
    (ii) He determines that the harvest is otherwise being conducted in 
a wasteful manner; or
    (iii) The lower end of the range of the estimated subsistence level 
provided in the notice issued under paragraph (b) of this section is 
reached.
    (2) A suspension based on a determination under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) 
of this section may be lifted by the Assistant Administrator if he finds 
that the conditions which led to the determination that the harvest was 
being conducted in a wasteful manner have been remedied.
    (3) A suspension issued in accordance with paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of 
this section may not exceed 48 hours in duration and shall be followed 
immediately by a review of the harvest data to determine if a finding 
under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section is warranted. If a the harvest 
is not suspended under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, the 
Assistant Administrator must provide a revised estimate of the number of 
seals required to satisfy the Pribilovians' subsistence needs.
    (f) The Assistant Administrator shall terminate the take provided 
for in Sec. 215.31 on August 8 of each year or when it is determined 
under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section that the subsistence needs of 
the Pribilovians on the island have been satisfied, whichever occurs 
first.

Sec. 216.90  Purposes.

    This subpart governs the requirements for using the official mark 
described in Sec. 216.95 or an alternative mark that refers to 
dolphins, porpoises, or marine mammals, to label tuna or tuna products 
offered for sale in or exported from the United States using the term 
dolphin-safe or suggesting the tuna were harvested in a manner not 
injurious to dolphins.

[69 FR 55307, Sept. 13, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 216.91  Dolphin-safe labeling standards.

    (a) It is a violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission 
Act (15 U.S.C. 45) for any producer, importer, exporter, distributor, or 
seller of any tuna products that are exported from or offered for sale 
in the United States to include on the label of those products the term 
``dolphin-safe'' or any other term or symbol that claims or suggests 
that the tuna contained in the products were harvested using a method of 
fishing that is not harmful to dolphins if the products contain tuna 
harvested:
    (1) ETP large purse seine vessel. In the ETP by a purse seine vessel 
of greater than 400 st (362.8 mt) carrying capacity unless:
    (i) the documentation requirements for dolphin-safe tuna under Sec. 
216.92 and 216.93 are met;
    (ii) No dolphins were killed or seriously injured during the sets in 
which the tuna were caught; and
    (iii) None of the tuna were caught on a trip using a purse seine net 
intentionally deployed on or to encircle dolphins, provided that this 
paragraph (a)(1)(iii) will not apply if the Assistant Administrator 
publishes a notification in the Federal Register announcing a finding 
under 16 U.S.C. 1385(g)(2) that the intentional deployment of purse 
seine nets on or encirclement of dolphins is not having a significant 
adverse impact on any depleted stock.
    (2) Non-ETP purse seine vessel. Outside the ETP by a vessel using a 
purse seine net:
    (i) In a fishery in which the Assistant Administrator has determined 
that a regular and significant association occurs between dolphins and 
tuna (similar to the association between dolphins and tuna in the ETP), 
unless such products are accompanied by a written statement, executed by 
the Captain of the vessel and an observer participating in a national or 
international program acceptable to the Assistant Administrator, 
certifying that no purse seine net was intentionally deployed on or used 
to encircle dolphins during the particular trip on which the tuna were 
caught and no dolphins were killed or seriously injured in the sets in 
which the tuna were caught; or

[[Page 56]]

    (ii) In any other fishery unless the products are accompanied by a 
written statement executed by the Captain of the vessel certifying that 
no purse seine net was intentionally deployed on or used to encircle 
dolphins during the particular trip on which the tuna was harvested;
    (3) Driftnet. By a vessel engaged in large-scale driftnet fishing; 
or
    (4) Other fisheries. By a vessel in a fishery other than one 
described in paragraphs (a)(1) through(a)(3) of this section that is 
identified by the Assistant Administrator as having a regular and 
significant mortality or serious injury of dolphins, unless such product 
is accompanied by a written statement, executed by the Captain of the 
vessel and an observer participating in a national or international 
program acceptable to the Assistant Administrator, that no dolphins were 
killed or seriously injured in the sets or other gear deployments in 
which the tuna were caught, provided that the Assistant Administrator 
determines that such an observer statement is necessary.
    (b) It is a violation of section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission 
Act (15 U.S.C. 45) to willingly and knowingly use a label referred to in 
this section in a campaign or effort to mislead or deceive consumers 
about the level of protection afforded dolphins under the IDCP.
    (c) A tuna product that is labeled with the official mark, described 
in Sec. 216.95, may not be labeled with any other label or mark that 
refers to dolphins, porpoises, or marine mammals.

Sec. 216.92  Dolphin-safe requirements for tuna harvested in the ETP
by large purse seine vessels.

    (a) U.S. vessels. Tuna products that contain tuna harvested by U.S. 
flag purse seine vessels of greater than 400 st (362.8 mt) carrying 
capacity in the ETP may be labeled dolphin-safe only if the following 
requirements are met:
    (1) Tuna Tracking Forms containing a complete record of all the 
fishing activities on the trip, certified by the vessel Captain and the 
observer, are submitted to the Administrator, Southwest Region, at the 
end of the fishing trip during which the tuna was harvested;
    (2) The tuna is delivered for processing to a U.S. tuna processor in 
a plant located in one of the 50 states, Puerto Rico, or American Samoa 
that is in compliance with the tuna tracking and verification 
requirements of Sec. 216.93; and
    (3) The tuna or tuna products meet the dolphin-safe labeling 
standards under Sec. 216.91.
    (b) Imported tuna. (1) Yellowfin tuna or tuna products harvested in 
the ETP by vessels of greater than 400 st (362.8 mt) carrying capacity 
and presented for import into the United States may be labeled dolphin-
safe only if the yellowfin tuna was harvested by a U.S. vessel fishing 
in compliance with the requirements of the IDCP and applicable U.S. law, 
or by a vessel belonging to a nation that has obtained an affirmative 
finding under Sec. 216.24(f)(8).
    (2) Tuna or tuna products, other than yellowfin tuna, harvested in 
the ETP by purse seine vessels of greater than 400 st (362.8 mt) 
carrying capacity and presented for import into the United States may be 
labeled dolphin-safe only if:
    (i) The tuna was harvested by a U.S. vessel fishing in compliance 
with the requirements of the IDCP and applicable U.S. law, or by a 
vessel belonging to a nation that is a Party to the Agreement on the 
IDCP or has applied to become a Party and is adhering to all the 
requirements of the Agreement on the IDCP Tuna Tracking and Verification 
Plan;
    (ii) The tuna or tuna products are accompanied by a properly 
completed FCO; and
    (iii) The tuna or tuna products are accompanied by valid 
documentation signed by a representative of the appropriate IDCP member 
nation, containing the harvesting vessel names and tuna tracking form 
numbers represented in the shipment, and certifying that:
    (A) There was an IDCP approved observer on board the vessel(s) 
during the entire trip(s); and
    (B) The tuna contained in the shipment were caught according to the 
dolphin-safe labeling standards of Sec. 216.91.

[69 FR 55307, Sept. 13, 2004]

[[Page 57]]


<R05>
Sec. 216.93  Tracking and verification program.

    The Administrator, Southwest Region, has established a national 
tracking and verification program to accurately document the dolphin-
safe condition of tuna, under the standards set forth in Sec. Sec. 
216.91 and 216.92. The tracking program includes procedures and reports 
for use when importing tuna into the United States and during U.S. purse 
seine fishing, processing, and marketing in the United States and 
abroad. Verification of tracking system operations is attained through 
the establishment of audit and document review requirements. The 
tracking program is consistent with the international tuna tracking and 
verification program adopted by the Parties to the Agreement on the 
IDCP.
    (a) Tuna tracking forms. Whenever a U.S. flag tuna purse seine 
vessel of greater than 400 st (362.8 mt) carrying capacity fishes in the 
ETP, IDCP approved Tuna Tracking Forms (TTFs), bearing a unique number 
assigned to that trip, are used by the observer to record every set made 
during that trip. One TTF is used to record dolphin-safe sets and a 
second TTF is used to record non-dolphin-safe sets. The information 
entered on the TTFs following each set includes the date, well number, 
weights by species composition, estimated tons loaded, and additional 
notes, if any. The observer and the vessel engineer initial the entry as 
soon as possible following each set, and the vessel captain and observer 
review and sign both TTFs at the end of the fishing trip certifying that 
the information on the forms is accurate. TTFs are confidential official 
documents of the IDCP, consistent with Article XVIII of the Agreement on 
the IDCP, and the Agreement on the IDCP Rules of Confidentiality.
    (b) Dolphin-Safe Certification. Upon request, the Office of the 
Administrator, Southwest Region, will provide written certification that 
tuna harvested by U.S. purse seine vessels greater than 400 st (362.8 
mt) carrying capacity is dolphin-safe, but only if NMFS' review of the 
TTFs for the subject trip shows that the tuna for which the 
certification is requested is dolphin-safe under the requirements of the 
Agreement on the IDCP and U.S. law.
    (c) Tracking fishing operations. (1) During ETP fishing trips by 
purse seine vessels greater than 400 st (362.8 mt) carrying capacity, 
tuna caught in sets designated as dolphin-safe by the vessel observer 
must be stored separately from tuna caught in non-dolphin-safe sets from 
the time of capture through unloading. Vessel personnel will decide into 
which wells tuna will be loaded. The observer will initially designate 
whether each set is dolphin-safe or not, based on his/her observation of 
the set. The observer will initially identify a vessel fish well as 
dolphin-safe if the first tuna loaded into the well during a trip was 
captured in a set in which no dolphin died or was seriously injured. The 
observer will initially identify a vessel fish well as non-dolphin-safe 
if the first tuna loaded into the well during a trip was captured in a 
set in which a dolphin died or was seriously injured. Any tuna loaded 
into a well previously designated non-dolphin-safe is considered non-
dolphin-safe tuna. The observer will change the designation of a 
dolphin-safe well to non-dolphin-safe if any tuna are loaded into the 
well that were captured in a set in which a dolphin died or was 
seriously injured.
    (2) The captain, managing owner, or vessel agent of a U.S. purse 
seine vessel greater than 400 st (362.8 mt) returning to port from a 
trip, any part of which included fishing in the ETP, must provide at 
least 48 hours notice of the vessel's intended place of landing, arrival 
time, and schedule of unloading to the Administrator, Southwest Region.
    (3) If the trip terminates when the vessel enters port to unload 
part or all of its catch, new TTFs will be assigned to the new trip, and 
any information concerning tuna retained on the vessel will be recorded 
as the first entry on the TTFs for the new trip. If the trip is not 
terminated following a partial unloading, the vessel will retain the 
original TTFs and submit a copy of those TTFs to the Administrator, 
Southwest Region, within 5 working days. In either case, the species and 
amount unloaded will be noted on the respective originals.

[[Page 58]]

    (4) Tuna offloaded to trucks, storage facilities, or carrier vessels 
must be loaded or stored in such a way as to maintain and safeguard the 
identification of the dolphin-safe or non-dolphin-safe designation of 
the tuna as it left the fishing vessel.
    (5)(i) When ETP caught tuna is offloaded from a U.S. purse seine 
vessel greater than 400 st (362.8 mt) directly to a U.S. canner within 
the 50 states, Puerto Rico, or American Samoa, or in any port and 
subsequently loaded aboard a carrier vessel for transport to a U.S. 
processing location, a NMFS representative may meet the U.S. purse seine 
vessel to receive the TTFs from the vessel observer and to monitor the 
handling of dolphin-safe and non-dolphin-safe tuna.
    (ii) If a NMFS representative does not meet the vessel in port at 
the time of arrival, the captain of the vessel or the vessel's managing 
office must assure delivery of the TTFs to the Administrator, Southwest 
Region, from that location within 5 working days of the end of the trip. 
Alternatively, if the captain approves and notifies the Administrator, 
Southwest Region, the captain may entrust the observer to deliver the 
signed TTFs to the local office of the IATTC.
    (iii) When ETP caught tuna is offloaded from a U.S. purse seine 
vessel greater than 400 st (362.8 mt) carrying capacity directly to a 
processing facility located outside the jurisdiction of the United 
States in a country that is a Party to the Agreement on the IDCP, the 
national authority in whose area of jurisdiction the tuna is to be 
processed will assume the responsibility for tracking and verification 
of the tuna offloaded. If a representative of the national authority 
meets the vessel in port, that representative will receive the original 
TTFs and assume the responsibility for providing copies of the TTFs to 
the Administrator, Southwest Region. If a representative of the national 
authority does not meet the vessel, the fishing vessel captain or the 
vessel's managing office must assure delivery of the completed TTFs in 
accordance with paragraphs (ii) and (v) of this section.
    (iv) When ETP caught tuna is offloaded from a U.S. purse seine 
vessel greater than 400 st (362.8 mt) carrying capacity in a country 
that is not a Party to the Agreement on the IDCP, the tuna becomes the 
tracking and verification responsibility of the national authority of 
the processing facility when it is unloaded from the fishing vessel. The 
captain or the vessel's managing office must assure delivery of the 
completed TTFs in accordance with paragraphs (ii) and (v) of this 
section.
    (v) TTFs are confidential documents of the IDCP. Vessel captains and 
managing offices may not provide copies of TTFs to any representatives 
of private organizations or non-member states.
    (d) Tracking cannery operations. (1) Whenever a U.S. tuna canning 
company in the 50 states, Puerto Rico, or American Samoa receives a 
domestic or imported shipment of ETP caught tuna for processing, a NMFS 
representative may be present to monitor delivery and verify that 
dolphin-safe and non-dolphin-safe tuna are clearly identified and remain 
segregated. Such inspections may be scheduled or unscheduled, and 
canners must allow the NMFS representative access to all areas and 
records.
    (2) Tuna processors must submit a report to the Administrator, 
Southwest Region, of all tuna received at their processing facilities in 
each calendar month whether or not the tuna is actually canned or stored 
during that month. Monthly cannery receipt reports must be submitted 
electronically or by mail before the last day of the month following the 
month being reported. Monthly reports must contain the following 
information:
    (i) Domestic receipts: dolphin-safe status, species, condition 
(round, loin, dressed, gilled and gutted, other), weight in short tons 
to the fourth decimal, ocean area of capture (ETP, western Pacific, 
Indian, eastern and western Atlantic, other), catcher vessel, trip 
dates, carrier name, unloading dates, and location of unloading.
    (ii) Import receipts: In addition to the information required in 
paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, a copy of the FCO for each imported 
receipt must be provided.
    (3) Tuna processors must report on a monthly basis the amounts of 
ETP-

[[Page 59]]

caught tuna that were immediately utilized upon receipt or removed from 
cold storage. This report may be submitted in conjunction with the 
monthly report required in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. This report 
must contain:
    (i) The date of removal from cold storage or disposition;
    (ii) Storage container or lot identifier number(s) and dolphin-safe 
or non-dolphin-safe designation of each container or lot; and
    (iii) Details of the disposition of fish (for example, canning, 
sale, rejection, etc.).
    (4) During canning activities, non-dolphin-safe tuna may not be 
mixed in any manner or at any time during processing with any dolphin-
safe tuna or tuna products and may not share the same storage 
containers, cookers, conveyers, tables, or other canning and labeling 
machinery.
    (e) Tracking imports. All tuna products, except fresh tuna, that are 
imported into the United States must be accompanied by a properly 
certified FCO as required by Sec. 216.24(f)(2). For tuna tracking 
purposes, copies of FCOs and associated certifications must be submitted 
by the importer of record to the Administrator, Southwest Region, within 
30 days of the shipment's entry into the commerce of the United States 
as required by Sec. 216.24(f)(3)(ii).
    (f) Verification requirements--(1) Record maintenance. Any exporter, 
transshipper, importer, processor, or wholesaler/distributor of any tuna 
or tuna products must maintain records related to that tuna for at least 
2 years. These records include, but are not limited to: FCOs and 
required certifications, any reports required in paragraphs (a), (b) and 
(d) of this section, invoices, other import documents, and trip reports.
    (2) Record submission. Within 30 days of receiving a shipment of 
tuna or tuna products, any exporter, transshipper, importer, processor, 
wholesaler/distributor of tuna or tuna products must submit to the 
Administrator, Southwest Region, all corresponding FCOs and required 
certifications for those tuna or tuna products.
    (3) Audits and spot checks. Upon request of the Administrator, 
Southwest Region, any exporter, transshipper, importer, processor, or 
wholesaler/distributor of tuna or tuna products must provide the 
Administrator, Southwest Region, timely access to all pertinent records 
and facilities to allow for audits and spot-checks on caught, landed, 
stored, and processed tuna.
    (g) Confidentiality of proprietary information. Information 
submitted to the Assistant Administrator under this section will be 
treated as confidential in accordance with NOAA Administrative Order 
216-100 ``Protection of Confidential Fisheries Statistics.''

 Subpart I_General Regulations Governing Small Takes of Marine Mammals 
                   Incidental to Specified Activities

    Source: 61 FR 15887, Apr. 10, 1996, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 216.101  Purpose.

    The regulations in this subpart implement section 101(a)(5) (A) 
through (D) of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, as amended, 16 
U.S.C. 1371(a)(5), which provides a mechanism for allowing, upon 
request, the incidental, but not intentional, taking of small numbers of 
marine mammals by U.S. citizens who engage in a specified activity 
(other than commercial fishing) within a specified geographic region.


<R05>
Sec. 216.102  Scope.

    The taking of small numbers of marine mammals under section 
101(a)(5) (A) through (D) of the Marine Mammal Protection Act may be 
allowed only if the National Marine Fisheries Service:
    (a) Finds, based on the best scientific evidence available, that the 
total taking by the specified activity during the specified time period 
will have a negligible impact on species or stock of

[[Page 61]]

marine mammal(s) and will not have an unmitigable adverse impact on the 
availability of those species or stocks of marine mammals intended for 
subsistence uses;
    (b) Prescribes either regulations under Sec. 216.106, or 
requirements and conditions contained within an incidental harassment 
authorization issued under Sec. 216.107, setting forth permissible 
methods of taking and other means of effecting the least practicable 
adverse impact on the species or stock of marine mammal and its habitat 
and on the availability of the species or stock of marine mammal for 
subsistence uses, paying particular attention to rookeries, mating 
grounds, and areas of similar significance; and
    (c) Prescribes either regulations or requirements and conditions 
contained within an incidental harassment authorization, as appropriate, 
pertaining to the monitoring and reporting of such taking. The specific 
regulations governing certain specified activities are contained in 
subsequent subparts of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 216.103  Definitions.

    In addition to definitions contained in the MMPA, and in Sec. 
216.3, and unless the context otherwise requires, in subsequent subparts 
to this part:
    Arctic waters means the marine and estuarine waters north of 60[deg] 
N. lat.
    Citizens of the United States and U.S. citizens mean individual U.S. 
citizens or any corporation or similar entity if it is organized under 
the laws of the United States or any governmental unit defined in 16 
U.S.C. 1362(13). U.S. Federal, state and local government agencies shall 
also constitute citizens of the United States for purposes of this part.
    Incidental harassment, incidental taking and incidental, but not 
intentional, taking all mean an accidental taking. This does not mean 
that the taking is unexpected, but rather it includes those takings that 
are infrequent, unavoidable or accidental. (A complete definition of 
``take'' is contained in Sec. 216.3).
    Negligible impact is an impact resulting from the specified activity 
that cannot be reasonably expected to, and is not reasonably likely to, 
adversely affect the species or stock through effects on annual rates of 
recruitment or survival.
    Small numbers means a portion of a marine mammal species or stock 
whose taking would have a negligible impact on that species or stock.
    Specified activity means any activity, other than commercial 
fishing, that takes place in a specified geographical region and 
potentially involves the taking of small numbers of marine mammals.
    Specified geographical region means an area within which a specified 
activity is conducted and that has certain biogeographic 
characteristics.
    Unmitigable adverse impact means an impact resulting from the 
specified activity:
    (1) That is likely to reduce the availability of the species to a 
level insufficient for a harvest to meet subsistence needs by:
    (i) Causing the marine mammals to abandon or avoid hunting areas;
    (ii) Directly displacing subsistence users; or
    (iii) Placing physical barriers between the marine mammals and the 
subsistence hunters; and
    (2) That cannot be sufficiently mitigated by other measures to 
increase the availability of marine mammals to allow subsistence needs 
to be met.


<R05>
Sec. 216.104  Submission of requests.

    (a) In order for the National Marine Fisheries Service to consider 
authorizing the taking by U.S. citizens of small numbers of marine 
mammals incidental to a specified activity (other than commercial 
fishing), or to make a finding that an incidental take is unlikely to 
occur, a written request must be submitted to the Assistant 
Administrator. All requests must include the following information for 
their activity:
    (1) A detailed description of the specific activity or class of 
activities that can be expected to result in incidental taking of marine 
mammals;
    (2) The date(s) and duration of such activity and the specific 
geographical region where it will occur;
    (3) The species and numbers of marine mammals likely to be found 
within the activity area;

[[Page 62]]

    (4) A description of the status, distribution, and seasonal 
distribution (when applicable) of the affected species or stocks of 
marine mammals likely to be affected by such activities;
    (5) The type of incidental taking authorization that is being 
requested (i.e., takes by harassment only; takes by harassment, injury 
and/or death) and the method of incidental taking;
    (6) By age, sex, and reproductive condition (if possible), the 
number of marine mammals (by species) that may be taken by each type of 
taking identified in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, and the number of 
times such takings by each type of taking are likely to occur;
    (7) The anticipated impact of the activity upon the species or stock 
of marine mammal;
    (8) The anticipated impact of the activity on the availability of 
the species or stocks of marine mammals for subsistence uses;
    (9) The anticipated impact of the activity upon the habitat of the 
marine mammal populations, and the likelihood of restoration of the 
affected habitat;
    (10) The anticipated impact of the loss or modification of the 
habitat on the marine mammal populations involved;
    (11) The availability and feasibility (economic and technological) 
of equipment, methods, and manner of conducting such activity or other 
means of effecting the least practicable adverse impact upon the 
affected species or stocks, their habitat, and on their availability for 
subsistence uses, paying particular attention to rookeries, mating 
grounds, and areas of similar significance;
    (12) Where the proposed activity would take place in or near a 
traditional Arctic subsistence hunting area and/or may affect the 
availability of a species or stock of marine mammal for Arctic 
subsistence uses, the applicant must submit either a plan of cooperation 
or information that identifies what measures have been taken and/or will 
be taken to minimize any adverse effects on the availability of marine 
mammals for subsistence uses. A plan must include the following:
    (i) A statement that the applicant has notified and provided the 
affected subsistence community with a draft plan of cooperation;
    (ii) A schedule for meeting with the affected subsistence 
communities to discuss proposed activities and to resolve potential 
conflicts regarding any aspects of either the operation or the plan of 
cooperation;
    (iii) A description of what measures the applicant has taken and/or 
will take to ensure that proposed activities will not interfere with 
subsistence whaling or sealing; and
    (iv) What plans the applicant has to continue to meet with the 
affected communities, both prior to and while conducting the activity, 
to resolve conflicts and to notify the communities of any changes in the 
operation;
    (13) The suggested means of accomplishing the necessary monitoring 
and reporting that will result in increased knowledge of the species, 
the level of taking or impacts on populations of marine mammals that are 
expected to be present while conducting activities and suggested means 
of minimizing burdens by coordinating such reporting requirements with 
other schemes already applicable to persons conducting such activity. 
Monitoring plans should include a description of the survey techniques 
that would be used to determine the movement and activity of marine 
mammals near the activity site(s) including migration and other habitat 
uses, such as feeding. Guidelines for developing a site-specific 
monitoring plan may be obtained by writing to the Director, Office of 
Protected Resources; and
    (14) Suggested means of learning of, encouraging, and coordinating 
research opportunities, plans, and activities relating to reducing such 
incidental taking and evaluating its effects.
    (b)(1) The Assistant Administrator shall determine the adequacy and 
completeness of a request and, if determined to be adequate and 
complete, will begin the public review process by publishing in the 
Federal Register either:
    (i) A proposed incidental harassment authorization; or
    (ii) A notice of receipt of a request for the implementation or 
reimplementation of regulations governing the incidental taking.

[[Page 63]]

    (2) Through notice in the Federal Register, newspapers of general 
circulation, and appropriate electronic media in the coastal areas that 
may be affected by such activity, NMFS will invite information, 
suggestions, and comments for a period not to exceed 30 days from the 
date of publication in the Federal Register. All information and 
suggestions will be considered by the National Marine Fisheries Service 
in developing, if appropriate, the most effective regulations governing 
the issuance of letters of authorization or conditions governing the 
issuance of an incidental harassment authorization.
    (3) Applications that are determined to be incomplete or 
inappropriate for the type of taking requested, will be returned to the 
applicant with an explanation of why the application is being returned.
    (c) The Assistant Administrator shall evaluate each request to 
determine, based upon the best available scientific evidence, whether 
the taking by the specified activity within the specified geographic 
region will have a negligible impact on the species or stock and, where 
appropriate, will not have an unmitigable adverse impact on the 
availability of such species or stock for subsistence uses. If the 
Assistant Administrator finds that the mitigating measures would render 
the impact of the specified activity negligible when it would not 
otherwise satisfy that requirement, the Assistant Administrator may make 
a finding of negligible impact subject to such mitigating measures being 
successfully implemented. Any preliminary findings of ``negligible 
impact'' and ``no unmitigable adverse impact'' shall be proposed for 
public comment along with either the proposed incidental harassment 
authorization or the proposed regulations for the specific activity.
    (d) If, subsequent to the public review period, the Assistant 
Administrator finds that the taking by the specified activity would have 
more than a negligible impact on the species or stock of marine mammal 
or would have an unmitigable adverse impact on the availability of such 
species or stock for subsistence uses, the Assistant Administrator shall 
publish in the Federal Register the negative finding along with the 
basis for denying the request.


<R05>
Sec. 216.105  Specific regulations.

    (a) For all petitions for regulations under this paragraph, 
applicants must provide the information requested in Sec. 216.104(a) on 
their activity as a whole, which includes, but is not necessarily 
limited to, an assessment of total impacts by all persons conducting the 
activity.
    (b) For allowed activities that may result in incidental takings of 
small numbers of marine mammals by harassment, serious injury, death or 
a combination thereof, specific regulations shall be established for 
each allowed activity that set forth:
    (1) Permissible methods of taking;
    (2) Means of effecting the least practicable adverse impact on the 
species and its habitat and on the availability of the species for 
subsistence uses; and
    (3) Requirements for monitoring and reporting, including 
requirements for the independent peer-review of proposed monitoring 
plans where the proposed activity may affect the availability of a 
species or stock for taking for subsistence uses.
    (c) Regulations will be established based on the best available 
information. As new information is developed, through monitoring, 
reporting, or research, the regulations may be modified, in whole or in 
part, after notice and opportunity for public review.


<R05>
Sec. 216.106  Letter of Authorization.

    (a) A Letter of Authorization, which may be issued only to U.S. 
citizens, is required to conduct activities pursuant to any regulations 
established under Sec. 216.105. Requests for Letters of Authorization 
shall be submitted to the Director, Office of Protected Resources. The 
information to be submitted in a request for an authorization will be 
specified in the appropriate subpart to this part or may be obtained by 
writing to the above named person.
    (b) Issuance of a Letter of Authorization will be based on a 
determination that the level of taking will be consistent with the 
findings made for the total taking allowable under the specific 
regulations.

[[Page 64]]

    (c) Letters of Authorization will specify the period of validity and 
any additional terms and conditions appropriate for the specific 
request.
    (d) Notice of issuance of all Letters of Authorization will be 
published in the Federal Register within 30 days of issuance.
    (e) Letters of Authorization shall be withdrawn or suspended, either 
on an individual or class basis, as appropriate, if, after notice and 
opportunity for public comment, the Assistant Administrator determines 
that:
    (1) The regulations prescribed are not being substantially complied 
with; or
    (2) The taking allowed is having, or may have, more than a 
negligible impact on the species or stock or, where relevant, an 
unmitigable adverse impact on the availability of the species or stock 
for subsistence uses.
    (f) The requirement for notice and opportunity for public review in 
Sec. 216.106(e) shall not apply if the Assistant Administrator 
determines that an emergency exists that poses a significant risk to the 
wellbeing of the species or stocks of marine mammals concerned.
    (g) A violation of any of the terms and conditions of a Letter of 
Authorization or of the specific regulations shall subject the Holder 
and/or any individual who is operating under the authority of the 
Holder's Letter of Authorization to penalties provided in the MMPA.


<R05>
Sec. 216.107  Incidental harassment authorization for Arctic waters.

    (a) Except for activities that have the potential to result in 
serious injury or mortality, which must be authorized under Sec. 
216.105, incidental harassment authorizations may be issued, following a 
30-day public review period, to allowed activities that may result in 
only the incidental harassment of a small number of marine mammals. Each 
such incidental harassment authorization shall set forth:
    (1) Permissible methods of taking by harassment;
    (2) Means of effecting the least practicable adverse impact on the 
species, its habitat, and on the availability of the species for 
subsistence uses; and
    (3) Requirements for monitoring and reporting, including 
requirements for the independent peer-review of proposed monitoring 
plans where the proposed activity may affect the availability of a 
species or stock for taking for subsistence uses.
    (b) Issuance of an incidental harassment authorization will be based 
on a determination that the number of marine mammals taken by harassment 
will be small, will have a negligible impact on the species or stock of 
marine mammal(s), and will not have an unmitigable adverse impact on the 
availability of species or stocks for taking for subsistence uses.
    (c) An incidental harassment authorization will be either issued or 
denied within 45 days after the close of the public review period.
    (d) Notice of issuance or denial of an incidental harassment 
authorization will be published in the Federal Register within 30 days 
of issuance of a determination.
    (e) Incidental harassment authorizations will be valid for a period 
of time not to exceed 1 year but may be renewed for additional periods 
of time not to exceed 1 year for each reauthorization.
    (f) An incidental harassment authorization shall be modified, 
withdrawn, or suspended if, after notice and opportunity for public 
comment, the Assistant Administrator determines that:
    (1) The conditions and requirements prescribed in the authorization 
are not being substantially complied with; or
    (2) The authorized taking, either individually or in combination 
with other authorizations, is having, or may have, more than a 
negligible impact on the species or stock or, where relevant, an 
unmitigable adverse impact on the availability of the species or stock 
for subsistence uses.
    (g) The requirement for notice and opportunity for public review in 
paragraph (f) of this section shall not apply if the Assistant 
Administrator determines that an emergency exists that poses a 
significant risk to the well-being of the species or stocks of marine 
mammals concerned.
    (h) A violation of any of the terms and conditions of an incidental 
harassment authorization shall subject the

[[Page 65]]

holder and/or any individual who is operating under the authority of the 
holder's incidental harassment authorization to penalties provided in 
the MMPA.


<R05>
Sec. 216.108  Requirements for monitoring and reporting under 
incidental harassment authorizations for Arctic waters.

    (a) Holders of an incidental harassment authorization in Arctic 
waters and their employees, agents, and designees must cooperate with 
the National Marine Fisheries Service and other designated Federal, 
state, or local agencies to monitor the impacts of their activity on 
marine mammals. Unless stated otherwise within an incidental harassment 
authorization, the holder of an incidental harassment authorization 
effective in Arctic waters must notify the Alaska Regional Director, 
National Marine Fisheries Service, of any activities that may involve a 
take by incidental harassment in Arctic waters at least 14 calendar days 
prior to commencement of the activity.
    (b) Holders of incidental harassment authorizations effective in 
Arctic waters may be required by their authorization to designate at 
least one qualified biological observer or another appropriately 
experienced individual to observe and record the effects of activities 
on marine mammals. The number of observers required for monitoring the 
impact of the activity on marine mammals will be specified in the 
incidental harassment authorization. If observers are required as a 
condition of the authorization, the observer(s) must be approved in 
advance by the National Marine Fisheries Service.
    (c) The monitoring program must, if appropriate, document the 
effects (including acoustical) on marine mammals and document or 
estimate the actual level of take. The requirements for monitoring 
plans, as specified in the incidental harassment authorization, may vary 
depending on the activity, the location, and the time.
    (d) Where the proposed activity may affect the availability of a 
species or stock of marine mammal for taking for subsistence purposes, 
proposed monitoring plans or other research proposals must be 
independently peer-reviewed prior to issuance of an incidental 
harassment authorization under this subpart. In order to complete the 
peer-review process within the time frames mandated by the MMPA for an 
incidental harassment authorization, a proposed monitoring plan 
submitted under this paragraph must be submitted to the Assistant 
Administrator no later than the date of submission of the application 
for an incidental harassment authorization. Upon receipt of a complete 
monitoring plan, and at its discretion, the National Marine Fisheries 
Service will either submit the plan to members of a peer review panel 
for review or within 60 days of receipt of the proposed monitoring plan, 
schedule a workshop to review the plan. The applicant must submit a 
final monitoring plan to the Assistant Administrator prior to the 
issuance of an incidental harassment authorization.
    (e) At its discretion, the National Marine Fisheries Service may 
place an observer aboard vessels, platforms, aircraft, etc., to monitor 
the impact of activities on marine mammals.
    (f)(1) As specified in the incidental harassment authorization, the 
holder of an incidental harassment authorization for Arctic waters must 
submit reports to the Assistant Administrator within 90 days of 
completion of any individual components of the activity (if any), within 
90 days of completion of the activity, but no later than 120 days prior 
to expiration of the incidental harassment authorization, whichever is 
earlier. This report must include the following information:
    (i) Dates and type(s) of activity;
    (ii) Dates and location(s) of any activities related to monitoring 
the effects on marine mammals; and
    (iii) Results of the monitoring activities, including an estimate of 
the actual level and type of take, species name and numbers of each 
species observed, direction of movement of species, and any observed 
changes or modifications in behavior.
    (2) Monitoring reports will be reviewed by the Assistant 
Administrator and, if determined to be incomplete or inaccurate, will be 
returned to the

[[Page 66]]

holder of the authorization with an explanation of why the report is 
being returned. If the authorization holder disagrees with the findings 
of the Assistant Administrator, the holder may request an independent 
peer review of the report. Failure to submit a complete and accurate 
report may result in a delay in processing future authorization 
requests.
    (g) Results of any behavioral, feeding, or population studies, that 
are conducted supplemental to the monitoring program, should be made 
available to the National Marine Fisheries Service before applying for 
an incidental harassment authorization for the following year.

launch sounds will be obtained from 3 different locations of varying 
distances from the target missile's flight path. To the extent 
practicable, these acoustic recording locations will correspond with the 
haul-out sites where video and human observer monitoring is done.
    (ii) Acoustic recordings will be supplemented by the use of radar 
and telemetry systems to obtain the trajectory of target missiles in 
three dimensions.
    (iii) Acoustic equipment used to record launch sounds will be 
suitable for collecting a wide range of parameters, including the 
magnitude, characteristics, and duration of each target missile.
    (e) The holder of the Letter of Authorization must implement the 
following reporting requirements:
    (1) For each target missile launch, the lead contractor or lead 
observer for the holder of the Letter of Authorization must provide a 
status report on the information required under Sec. 216.155(d)(1)(iii) 
to the National Marine Fisheries Service, Southwest Regional Office, 
unless other arrangements for monitoring are agreed in writing.
    (2) An initial report must be submitted to the Office of Protected 
Resources, and the Southwest Regional Office at least 60 days prior to 
the expiration of each annual Letter of Authorization. This report must 
contain the following information:
    (i) Timing and nature of launch operations;

[[Page 74]]

    (ii) Summary of pinniped behavioral observations;
    (iii) Estimate of the amount and nature of all takes by harassment 
or by other means.
    (3) A draft comprehensive technical report will be submitted to the 
Office of Protected Resources and Southwest Regional Office, National 
Marine Fisheries Service, 180 days prior to the expiration of these 
regulations and providing full documentation of the methods, results, 
and interpretation of all monitoring tasks for launches to date plus 
preliminary information for missile launches during the first 6 months 
of the final Letter of Authorization.
    (4) A revised final technical report, including all monitoring 
results during the entire period of the Letter of Authorization, will be 
due 90 days after the end of the period of effectiveness of these 
regulations.
    (5) Both the 60-day and draft comprehensive technical reports will 
be subject to review and comment by the National Marine Fisheries 
Service. Any recommendations made by the National Marine Fisheries 
Service must be addressed in the final comprehensive report prior to 
acceptance by the National Marine Fisheries Service.
    (f) Activities related to the monitoring described in paragraph (d) 
of this section, or in the Letter of Authorization issued under Sec. 
216.106, may be conducted without the need for a separate scientific

    (a) Under a Letter of Authorization issued pursuant to Sec. 
216.106, the U.S. Navy may incidentally, but not intentionally, take 
marine mammals in the course of the activity described in Sec. 
216.161(a) provided all requirements of these regulations and such 
Letter of Authorization are met.
    (b) The activity identified in paragraph Sec. 216.161(a) of this 
section must be conducted in a manner that minimizes, to the greatest 
extent practicable, adverse impacts on marine mammals and their habitat. 
When detonating explosives, the following mitigation measures must be 
implemented:

[[Page 76]]

    (1) Except as provided under the following paragraph (2), if any 
marine mammals are visually detected within the designated 3.5 nm (6.5 
km) Safety Range surrounding the USS MESA VERDE, detonation must be 
delayed until the marine mammals are positively resighted outside the 
Safety Range either due to the animal(s) swimming out of the Safety 
Range or due to the Safety Range moving beyond the mammal's last 
verified location.
    (2) If a North Atlantic right whale or other marine mammal listed 
under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) is seen within the Safety Range, 
detonation must not occur until the animal is positively resighted 
outside the Safety Range and at least one additional aerial monitoring 
of the Safety Range shows that no other right whales or other ESA-listed 
marine mammals are present;
    (3) If the sea state exceeds 3 on the Beaufort scale (i.e., 
whitecaps on 33 to 50 percent of surface; 2 ft (0.6 m) to 3 ft (0.9 m) 
waves), the visibility is equal to or less than 3 nm (5.6 km), or the 
aircraft ceiling (i.e., vertical visibility) is equal to or less than 
1,000 ft (305 m), detonation must not occur until conditions improve 
sufficiently for aerial surveillance to be undertaken.
    (4) A detonation must not be conducted earlier than 3 hours after 
sunrise or later than 3 hours prior to sunset to ensure adequate 
daylight for conducting the pre-detonation and post-detonation 
monitoring requirements in Sec. 216.165;
    (5) If post-detonation surveys determine that an injury or lethal 
take of a marine mammal has occurred,
    (i) the Director, Office of Protected Resources, National Marine 
Fisheries Service must be notified within 24 hours of the taking 
determination,
    (ii) the FSST procedures and monitoring methods must be reviewed in 
coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service, and
    (iii) appropriate changes to avoid future injury or mortality must 
be made prior to conducting the next detonation.


<R05>
Sec. 216.164  Prohibitions.

    No person in connection with the activities described in Sec. 
216.161(a) shall:
    (a) Take any marine mammal not specified in Sec. 216.161(b);
    (b) Take any marine mammal specified in Sec. 216.161(b) other than 
by incidental, unintentional Level A or Level B harassment or mortality;
    (c) Take a marine mammal specified in Sec. 216.161(b) if such 
taking results in more than a negligible impact on the species or stocks 
or marine mammals;
    (d) Violate, or failure to comply with, the requirements of a Letter 
of Authorization issued under Sec. 216.106.


<R05>
Sec. 216.165  Requirements for monitoring and reporting.

    (a) The holder of the Letter of Authorization is required to 
cooperate with the National Marine Fisheries Service and any other 
Federal, or state or local agency with regulatory authority for 
monitoring the impacts of the activity on marine mammals. The holder 
must notify the Director, Office of Protected Resources, National Marine 
Fisheries Service at least 2 weeks prior to activities involving the 
detonation of explosives in order to satisfy paragraph (f) of this 
section.
    (b) The holder of the Letter of Authorization must designate at 
least 6 experienced on-site marine mammal observers (MMOs) onboard the 
USS MESA VERDE, 2 experienced MMOs onboard the survey aircraft and 2 
experienced MMOs onboard the Navy support vessel each of whom has been 
approved in advance by NMFS, to monitor the Safety Range for presence of 
marine mammals and to record the effects of explosives detonation on 
marine mammals that inhabit the Navy's Jacksonville/Charleston Operating 
Area offshore of Mayport, Florida.
    (c)(1) Prior to each detonation for the FSST, an area will be 
located which has been determined by an aerial survey to contain the 
lowest marine mammal abundance relative to other areas within the area 
off Mayport, FL.
    (2) The test area must be monitored by aerial and shipboard 
monitoring for the following periods of time:
    (i) 48-72 hours prior to a scheduled detonation (aircraft only),
    (ii) on the day of detonation,

[[Page 77]]

    (iii) immediately after each detonation and continuing for at least 
3 hours subsequent to each detonation (or until sighting conditions 
become unsuitable for visual observations),
    (iv) for at least 2 days after each detonation, unless weather and/
or sea conditions preclude surveillance, in which case post-test survey 
dates must be extended, and
    (v) for a period of 7 days after the last detonation for a minimum 
of 3 hours per day at the detonation site and down-current from the 
site.
    (3) Monitoring shall include, but is not limited to, aerial and 
vessel surveillance sufficient to ensure that no marine mammals are 
within the designated Safety Range prior to or at the time of 
detonation.
    (d) Under the direction of an attending U.S.-licensed veterinarian 
(an attending U.S. licensed veterinarian is one who has graduated from a 
veterinary school accredited by the American Veterinary Medical 
Association Council on Education, has a certificate by the American 
Veterinary Graduates Association's Education Commission for Foreign 
Veterinary Graduates, or has received equivalent formal education, as 
determined by the NMFS Assistant Administrator), an examination and 
recovery of any dead or injured marine mammals will be conducted in 
accordance with protocols and best practices of the NOAA Health and 
Stranding Response Program. Necropsies will be performed and tissue 
samples taken from any dead animals. After completion of the necropsy, 
animals not retained for shoreside examination will be tagged and 
returned to the sea.
    (e) Activities related to the monitoring described in paragraphs (c) 
and (d) of this section, including the retention of marine mammals, may 
be conducted without a separate scientific research permit. The use of 
retained marine mammals for scientific research other than shoreside 
examination must be authorized pursuant to Subpart D of this part.
    (f) Subject to relevant Navy regulations, the National Marine 
Fisheries Service at its discretion may place an observer on any ship or 
aircraft involved in marine mammal monitoring either prior to, during, 
or after explosives detonation.
    (g) A final report must be submitted to the Director, Office of 
Protected Resources, no later than 120 days after completion of the USS 
MESA VERDE (LPD 19) shock trial. This report must contain the following 
information:
    (1) Date and time of all detonations conducted under the Letter of 
Authorization.
    (2) A detailed description of all pre-detonation and post-detonation 
activities related to mitigating and monitoring the effects of 
explosives detonation on marine mammals.
    (3) Results of the monitoring program, including numbers by species/
stock of any marine mammals noted injured or killed as a result of the 
detonation and an estimate of the number, by species, of marine mammals 
in the Safety Range at the time of detonation based on post-test aerial 
monitoring and current density estimates.
    (4) Results of coordination with coastal marine mammal/sea turtle 
stranding networks.

<R05>
Sec. 216.215  Definitions, terms, and criteria

    (a) Definitions.
    (1) Below-mud-line or BML means that the explosives are detonated 
below the water-mud interface, either inside or outside a pipe, other 
structure or cable.
    (2) Above-mud-line or AML means that the explosives are detonated in 
the water column above the water-mud interface, either inside or outside 
a pipe, other structure or cable.
    (3) Multiple charge detonation means any explosive configuration 
where more than one charge is required in a single detonation event.
    (4) Scenario means an alpha-numeric designation provided to describe 
charge size, activity location, and target design employed in order to 
determine the appropriate marine mammal mitigation/monitoring measures.
    (b) Terms
    (1) Impact zone (required for all scenarios) means the area around a 
decommissioning target measured by the horizontal radius, in which a 
marine mammal could be affected by the pressure or acoustic energy 
released during the detonation of an explosive-severance charge.
    (2) Predetonation survey (required for all scenarios) means any 
marine mammal monitoring survey (e.g., surface, aerial, or acoustic) 
conducted prior to the detonation of any explosive severance tool.
    (3) Postdetonation survey (required for all scenarios) means any 
marine mammal monitoring survey (e.g., surface, aerial, or post-post-
detonation aerial) conducted after the detonation event occurs.
    (4) Waiting period (required for all scenarios) means the amount of 
time detonation operations must hold before the requisite monitoring 
survey(s) can be repeated.
    (5) Company observer (for scenarios A1-A4 only) means trained 
company observers authorized to perform marine mammal detection surveys 
only for ``very-small'' blasting scenarios A1-A4.
    (6) NMFS observer (for scenarios B1-E4) means observers trained and 
approved by an instructor with experience as a NMFS Platform Removal 
Observer Program trainer. NMFS observers are required to perform marine 
mammal detection surveys for all detonation scenarios with the exception 
of scenarios A1-A4. Two NMFS observers will be assigned to each 
operation for detection survey duties, except mitigation-scenarios C2, 
C4, D2, D4, E2, and E4 require a minimum of three NMFS observers for the 
simultaneous surface, aerial, and acoustic surveys.
    (c) Criteria
    (1) Blasting category parameters and associated severance scenarios. 
To determine the appropriate marine mammal mitigation and monitoring 
requirements in Sec. Sec. 216.218 and 216.219, holders

[[Page 88]]

of Letters of Authorization for activities described in Sec. 216.211(a) 
of this subpart must determine, from Table 1 in Sec. 216.217(b)(1), the 
appropriate explosive severance mitigation/monitoring scenario to follow 
for the blasting category, species-delineation zone, and charge 
configuration for their activity.
    (2) [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 216.216  Mitigation.

    (a) The activity identified in Sec. 216.211(a) must be conducted in 
a manner that minimizes, to the greatest extent practicable, adverse 
impacts on marine mammals and their habitats. When conducting operations 
identified in Sec. 216.211(a), all mitigation measures contained in 
this subpart and in the Letter of Authorization issued pursuant to 
Sec. Sec. 216.106 and 216.218 must be implemented. When using 
explosives, the following mitigation measures must be carried out:
    (1)(i) If marine mammals are observed within (or about to enter) the 
marine mammal impact zone identified in Table 1 in Sec. 216.217(b)(1) 
column 5 for the relevant charge range and configuration (i.e., BML or 
AML) for the activity, detonation must be delayed until the marine 
mammal(s) are outside that zone;
    (ii) Pre-detonation surveys shall not begin prior to sunrise and 
detonations shall not occur if the post-detonation survey cannot be 
concluded prior to sunset;
    (iii) Whenever weather or sea conditions preclude adequate aerial, 
shipboard or subsurface marine mammal monitoring as determined by the 
trained observer, detonations must be delayed until conditions improve 
sufficiently for marine mammal monitoring to be undertaken or resumed;
    (iv) Whenever the weather or sea conditions prevent implementation 
of the aerial survey monitoring required under Sec. 216.217(c)(2), the 
aerial survey must be repeated prior to detonation of charges; and
    (v) Multiple charge detonations must be staggered at an interval of 
0.9 sec (900 msec) between blasts.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (b) If a marine mammal is found seriously injured, or dead, the 
explosive severance activity will immediately cease and the holder of 
the Letter of Authorization, designee or the designated lead observer 
will contact the Minerals Management Service and the Regional 
Administrator, National Marine Fisheries Service' Southeast Regional 
Office, or designee at the earliest opportunity. Procedures and 
monitoring methods will be reviewed and, if necessary, appropriate 
changes made to the mitigation and monitoring measures prior to 
conducting the next detonation to avoid future injury or mortality 
takings.
    (c) Any mitigation measures proposed to be contained in a Letter of 
Authorization that are not specified in this subpart, or not considered 
an emergency requirement under Sec. 216.219(d), will first be subject 
to notice and comment through publication in the Federal Register, as 
provided in Sec. 216.219(c).


<R05>
Sec. 216.217  Requirements for monitoring and reporting.

    (a) Holders of Letters of Authorization issued for activities 
described in Sec. 216.211(a) are required to cooperate with the 
National Marine Fisheries Service, and any other Federal, state or local 
agency with regulatory authority over the offshore oil-and-gas 
activities for the purpose of monitoring the impacts of the activity on 
marine mammals.
    (b)(1) Table 1 summarizes the required mitigation and monitoring 
survey modes, duration and zones for all blasting scenarios of marine 
mammal impact zones for implementation of surface and aerial monitoring 
requirements depending upon charge weight and severance scenario.
    (2) Holders of Letters of Authorization must fully comply with the 
relevant mitigation and monitoring program for the explosive-severance 
activity described in subparagraph (c) of this paragraph that 
corresponds to the holder of the Letter of Authorization's blast 
scenario shown in Table 1.

[[Page 90]]

    (c) Holders of Letters of Authorization must ensure that the 
following monitoring programs are conducted as appropriate for the 
required monitoring scenario.
    (1) Surface monitoring survey. A surface monitoring survey must be 
conducted for the length of time that corresponds to the relevant 
explosive severance scenario. Surface monitoring surveys are to be 
conducted from the highest vantage point and/or other location(s) that 
provide the best, clear view of the entire impact zone. These vantage 
points may be on the structure being removed or proximal surface vessels 
(i.e., crewboats, derrick barges, etc.). Surface surveys are restricted 
to daylight hours only, and the monitoring will cease if the designated 
lead observer determines that weather or marine conditions are not 
adequate for visual observations.
    (2) Aerial monitoring survey. Aerial surveys are required for all 
explosive severance scenarios except monitoring scenarios A1-A4. Aerial 
monitoring surveys are to be conducted from helicopters running standard 
low-altitude search patterns over the extent of the impact zone that 
corresponds to the appropriate explosive severance scenario. Aerial 
surveys will be restricted to daylight hours only (defined as ``legal 
sunrise'' to ``legal sunset''), and cannot begin until the requisite 
surface monitoring survey has been completed. Aerial surveys will cease 
if the designated lead observer determines that weather or marine 
conditions are not adequate for visual observations, or when the pilot/
removal supervisor determines that helicopter operations must be 
suspended.
    (3) Acoustic monitoring survey.
    (i) Acoustic monitoring surveys are required to be conducted on all 
Standard, Large, and Specialty blasting scenarios conducted at slope 
(<ls-thn-eq>200 m (656 ft)) locations (i.e., scenarios C2, C4, D2, D4, 
E2, and E4).
    (ii) Persons conducting acoustic surveys will be required to comply 
with NMFS-approved passive acoustic monitoring protocols and use 
approved devices and technicians.
    (iii) Acoustic surveys will be run concurrent with requisite pre-
detonation surveys, beginning with the surface observations and 
concluding at the finish of the aerial surveys when the detonation(s) is 
allowed to proceed.
    (4) Post-detonation surface monitoring survey. A 30-minute post-
detonation surface survey must be conducted by the trained company 
observer for scenarios A1 - A4 immediately upon conclusion of the 
detonation.
    (5) Post-detonation aerial monitoring survey. For scenarios B1-D4, a 
30-minute aerial survey must be conducted immediately upon conclusion of 
the detonation. For scenarios E1-E4, a 45-minute aerial survey must be 
conducted immediately upon conclusion of the detonation.
    (6) Post-post-detonation aerial monitoring survey. Post-post-
detonation aerial monitoring surveys must be conducted for scenarios C4, 
D2, D4, E2 and E4 within 2-7 days after detonation activities conclude, 
by either helicopter or fixed-wing aircraft. Observations are to start 
at the removal site and proceed leeward and outward of wind and current 
movement. Any distressed, shocked, injured or dead marine mammals will 
be noted in the survey report, and if possible, tracked and collected 
after notifying the National Marine Fisheries Service within the time 
requirements stated in Sec. 216.217(f).
    (7) If unforeseen conditions or events occur during an explosive 
severance operation that may necessitate additional monitoring not 
specified in this paragraph, the designated NMFS lead observer will 
contact the appropriate National Marine Fisheries Service and Minerals 
Management Service personnel as detailed in the Letter of Authorization 
for additional guidance.
    (d) Holders of Letters of Authorization must conduct all monitoring 
and research required under the Letter of Authorization. Any monitoring 
or research measures proposed to be contained in a Letter of 
Authorization that are not specified in this subpart or not considered 
an emergency requirement under Sec. 216.218(d), will first be subject 
to public notice and comment through publication in the Federal 
Register, as provided by Sec. 216.219(c).
    (e) Reporting (1) A report summarizing the results of structure 
removal

<R05>
Sec. 216.254  Mitigation.

    The activity identified in Sec. 216.250(a) must be conducted in a 
manner that minimizes, to the greatest extent practicable, adverse 
impacts on marine mammal species and stocks and their habitats. When 
conducting operations identified in Sec. 216.250(a) under a Letter of 
Authorization, the following mitigation measures must be implemented:
    (a)(1) For the JASSM, the holder of the Letter of Authorization must 
establish and monitor a safety zone for marine mammals with a radius of 
2.0 nm (3.7 km) from the center of the detonation and a buffer zone with 
a radius of 1.0 nm (1.85 km) radius from the outer edge of the safety 
zone.
    (2) For the SDB, the holder of the Letter of Authorization must 
establish and monitor a safety for marine mammals with a radius of no 
less than 5 nm (9.3 km) for single bombs and 10 nm (18.5 km) for double 
bombs and a buffer zone from the outer edge of the safety zone with a 
radius of at least 2.5 nm (4.6 km) for single bombs and 5 nm (18.5 km) 
for double bombs.
    (b) Prior to a JASSM or SDB launch:
    (1) If any marine mammals are observed within the designated safety 
zone prescribed in condition (a)(1) above, or within the buffer zone 
prescribed in condition (a)(2) above and it/they are on a course that 
will put them within the safety zone prior to an JASSM or SDB launch, 
the launch must be delayed until all marine mammals are no longer within 
the designated safety zone.
    (2) If any marine mammals are detected in the buffer zone and 
subsequently cannot be reacquired, the mission launch will not continue 
until the next verified location is outside of the safety zone and the 
animal is moving away from the mission area.
    (3) If weather and/or sea conditions preclude adequate aerial 
surveillance for detecting marine mammals, detonation must be delayed 
until adequate sea conditions exist for aerial surveillance to be 
undertaken. Adequate sea conditions means the sea state does not exceed 
Beaufort sea state 3.5 (i.e., whitecaps on 33 to 50 percent of surface; 
0.6 m (2 ft) to 0.9 m (3 ft) waves), the visibility is 5.6 km (3 nm) or 
greater, and the ceiling is 305 m (1,000 ft) or greater.
    (4) To ensure adequate daylight for pre- and post-detonation 
monitoring, mission launches may not take place earlier than 2 hours 
after sunrise, and detonations may not take place later than 2 hours 
prior to sunset, or whenever darkness or weather conditions will 
preclude completion of the post-test survey effort described in Sec. 
216.255.
    (5) If post-detonation surveys determine that a serious injury or 
lethal take of a marine mammal has occurred, the test procedure and the 
monitoring methods must be reviewed with the National Marine Fisheries 
Service and appropriate changes must be made prior to conducting the 
next mission detonation.
    (6) Mission launches must be delayed if aerial or vessel monitoring 
programs described under Sec. 216.255 cannot be carried out fully.


<R05>
Sec. 216.255  Requirements for monitoring and reporting.

    (a) The Holder of the Letter of Authorization issued pursuant to 
Sec. Sec. 216.106 and 216.257 for activities described in Sec. 
216.250(a) is required to conduct the monitoring and reporting measures 
specified in this section and any additional monitoring measures 
contained in the Letter of Authorization.
    (b) The Holder of the Letter of Authorization is required to 
cooperate with the National Marine Fisheries Service, and any other 
Federal, state or local agency authorized to monitor the impacts of the 
activity on marine mammals. Unless specified otherwise in the Letter of 
Authorization, the

[[Page 97]]

Holder of the Letter of Authorization must notify the Director, Office 
of Protected Resources, National Marine Fisheries Service, or designee, 
by letter or telephone (301-713-2289), at least 2 weeks prior to any 
modification to the activity identified in Sec. 216.250(a) that has the 
potential to result in the mortality or Level A or Level B harassment of 
marine mammals that was not identified and addressed previously.
    (c) The Holder of this Authorization must:
    (1) Designate qualified on-site marine mammal observers to record 
the effects of mission launches on marine mammals that inhabit the 
northern Gulf of Mexico;
    (2) Have on-site marine mammal observers approved in advance by the 
National Marine Fisheries Service to conduct the mitigation, monitoring 
and reporting activities specified in these regulations and in the 
Letter of Authorization issued pursuant to Sec. 216.106 and Sec. 
216.257.
    (3) Conduct aerial surveys to reduce impacts on protected species. 
The aerial survey/monitoring team will consist of two experienced marine 
mammal observers, approved in advance by the Southeast Region, National 
Marine Fisheries Service. The aircraft will also have a data recorder 
who would be responsible for relaying the location, the species if 
possible, the direction of movement, and the number of animals sighted.
    (4) Conduct shipboard monitoring to reduce impacts to protected 
species. Trained marine mammal observers will conduct monitoring from 
the highest point possible on each mission or support vessel(s). The 
observer on the vessel must be equipped with optical equipment with 
sufficient magnification (e.g., 25X power ``Big-Eye'' binoculars. The 
marine mammal observation platform must be of sufficient height to 
provide observers a platform to see a major portion of the safety zone.
    (d) The aerial and shipboard monitoring teams will maintain proper 
lines of communication to avoid communication deficiencies. The 
observers from the aerial team and operations vessel will have direct 
communication with the lead scientist aboard the operations vessel.
    (e) Pre-mission Monitoring: Approximately 5 hours prior to the 
mission, or at daybreak, the appropriate vessel(s) would be on-site in 
the primary test site near the location of the earliest planned mission 
point. Observers onboard the vessel will assess the suitability of the 
test site, based on visual observation of marine mammals and overall 
environmental conditions (visibility, sea state, etc.). This information 
will be relayed to the lead scientist.
    (f) Three Hours Prior to Mission:
    (1) Approximately three hours prior to the mission launch, aerial 
monitoring will commence within the test site to evaluate the test site 
for environmental suitability. Evaluation of the entire test site would 
take approximately 1 to 1.5 hours. The aerial monitoring team will begin 
monitoring the safety zone and buffer zone around the target area.
    (2) Shipboard observers will monitor the safety and buffer zone, and 
the lead scientist will enter all marine mammal sightings, including the 
time of sighting and the direction of travel, into a marine animal 
tracking and sighting database.
    (g) One to 1.5 Hours Prior to Mission Launch:
    (1) Depending upon the mission, aerial and shipboard viewers will be 
instructed to leave the area and remain outside the safety area. The 
aerial team will report all marine animals spotted and their directions 
of travel to the lead scientist onboard the vessel.
    (2) The shipboard monitoring team will continue searching the buffer 
zone for protected species as it leaves the safety zone. The surface 
vessels will continue to monitor from outside of the safety area until 
after impact.
    (h) Post-mission monitoring:
    (1) The vessels will move into the safety zone from outside the 
safety zone and continue monitoring for at least two hours, 
concentrating on the area down current of the test site.
    (2) The Holder of the Letter of Authorization will closely 
coordinate mission launches with marine animal

[[Page 98]]

stranding networks. Coordination shall include:
    (i) Pre-activity notification of a PSW exercise; and
    (ii) Post-event surveying of the Eglin AFB shore-line in the 
vicinity of the PSW exercise.
    (3) The monitoring team will document any dead or injured marine 
mammals and, if practicable, recover and examine any dead animals.
    (i) Activities related to the monitoring described in this section 
may include retention of marine mammals without the need for a separate 
scientific research permit.
    (j) The Holder of the Letter of Authorization must conduct any 
marine mammal research required under the Letter of Authorization.
    (k) Reporting. (1) Unless specified otherwise in the Letter of 
Authorization, the Holder of the Letter of Authorization must submit an 
annual report to the Director, Office of Protected Resources, National 
Marine Fisheries Service, no later than 30 days prior to the date of 
expiration of the Letter of Authorization. This report must contain all 
information required by these regulations and the Letter of 
Authorization.
    (2) The final comprehensive report on all marine mammal monitoring 
and research conducted during the period of these regulations must be 
submitted to the Director, Office of Protected Resources, National 
Marine Fisheries Service at least 240 days prior to expiration of these 
regulations or 240 days after the expiration of these regulations if new 
regulations will not be requested.

                      Subpart A_General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 221.1  What is the purpose of this part, and to what license 
proceedings does it apply?

    (a) Hearing process. (1) The regulations in subparts A and B of this 
part contain rules of practice and procedure applicable to hearings on 
disputed issues of material fact with respect to mandatory prescriptions 
that the Department of Commerce, acting through the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration's National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) 
may develop for inclusion in a hydropower license issued by the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) under subchapter I of the Federal 
Power Act (FPA), 16 U.S.C. 791 et seq. The authority to develop these 
prescriptions is granted by FPA section 18, 16 U.S.C. 811, which 
authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to prescribe fishways.
    (2) The hearing process under this part does not apply to 
recommendations that the Department of Commerce may submit to FERC under 
FPA section 10(a) or (j), 16 U.S.C. 803(a), (j).
    (3) The FPA also grants the Department of Agriculture and Interior 
the authority to develop mandatory conditions, and the Department of the 
Interior the authority to develop mandatory prescriptions, for inclusion 
in a hydropower license. Where the Department of Commerce and either or 
both of these other Departments develop conditions or prescriptions to 
be included in the same hydropower license and where the Departments 
agree to consolidate the hearings under Sec. 221.23:
    (i) A hearing conducted under this part will also address disputed 
issues of material fact with respect to any condition or prescription 
developed by one of the other Departments; or
    (ii) A hearing requested under this part will be conducted by one of 
the other Departments, pursuant to 7 CFR 1.601 et seq. or 43 CFR 45.1 et 
seq., as applicable.
    (4) The regulations in subparts A and B of this part will be 
construed and applied to each hearing process to achieve a just and 
speedy determination, consistent with adequate consideration of the 
issues involved and the provisions of Sec. 221.60(a).
    (b) Alternatives process. The regulations in subparts A and C of 
this part contain rules of procedure applicable to the submission and 
consideration of alternative prescriptions under FPA section 33, 16 
U.S.C. 823d. That section allows any party to the license proceeding to 
propose an alternative to a fishway prescribed by NMFS under section 18.

[[Page 101]]

    (c) Reservation of authority. Where NMFS notifies FERC that it is 
reserving its authority to develop one or more prescriptions during the 
term of the license, the hearing and alternatives processes under this 
part for such prescriptions will be available if and when NMFS exercises 
its reserved authority. NMFS will consult with FERC and notify the 
license parties regarding how to initiate the hearing process and 
alternatives process at that time.
    (d) Applicability. (1) This part applies to any hydropower license 
proceeding for which the license has not been issued as of November 17, 
2005 and for which one or more preliminary prescriptions or 
prescriptions have been or are filed with FERC.
    (2) If NMFS has already filed one or more preliminary prescriptions 
or prescriptions as of November 17, 2005, the special applicability 
provisions of Sec. 221.4 also apply.

within 30 days after the deadline for NMFS to file preliminary 
prescriptions with FERC.
    (b) Content. Your proposal must include:
    (1) A description of the alternative, in an equivalent level of 
detail to NMFS's preliminary prescription;
    (2) An explanation of how the alternative will be no less protective 
than the fishway prescribed by NMFS;
    (3) An explanation of how the alternative, as compared to the 
preliminary prescription, will:
    (i) Cost significantly less to implement; or
    (ii) Result in improved operation of the project works for 
electricity production;
    (4) An explanation of how the alternative will affect:
    (i) Energy supply, distribution, cost, and use;

    (5) Specific citations to any scientific studies, literature, and 
other documented information relied on to support your proposal, 
including any assumptions you are making (e.g., regarding the cost of 
energy or the rate of inflation). If any such document is not already in 
the license proceeding record, you must provide a copy with the 
proposal.


<R05>
Sec. 221.72  What will NMFS do with a proposed alternative?

    If any license party proposes an alternative to a preliminary 
prescription under Sec. 221.71(a)(1), NMFS must do the following within 
60 days after the deadline for filing comments to FERC's NEPA document 
under 18 CFR 5.25(c):

alternatives under Sec. 221.73(c).


<R05>
Sec. 221.73  How will NMFS analyze a proposed alternative and 
formulate its modified prescription?

    (a) In deciding whether to adopt a proposed alternative, NMFS must 
consider evidence and supporting material provided by any license party 
or otherwise available to NMFS including:
    (1) Any evidence on the implementation costs or operational impacts 
for electricity production of the proposed alternative;
    (2) Any comments received on NMFS's preliminary prescription;
    (3) Any ALJ decision on disputed issues of material fact issued 
under Sec. 221.60 with respect to the preliminary prescription;
    (4) Comments received on any draft or final NEPA documents; and
    (5) The license party's proposal under Sec. 221.71.
    (b) NMFS must adopt a proposed alternative if NMFS determines, based 
on substantial evidence provided by any license party or otherwise 
available to NMFS, that the alternative will be no less protective than 
NMFS's preliminary prescription and will, as compared to NMFS's 
preliminary prescription:
    (1) Cost significantly less to implement; or

[[Page 119]]

    (2) Result in improved operation of the project works for 
electricity production.
    (c) When NMFS files with FERC the prescription that NMFS adopts as 
its modified prescription under Sec. Sec. 221.72(b), it must also file:
    (1) A written statement explaining:
    (i) The basis for the adopted prescription; and
    (ii) If NMFS is not adopting any alternative, its reasons for not 
doing so; and
    (2) Any study, data, and other factual information relied on that is 
not already part of the licensing proceeding record.
    (d) The written statement under paragraph (c)(1) of this section 
must demonstrate that NMFS gave equal consideration to the effects of 
the prescription adopted and any alternative prescription not adopted 
on:
    (1) Energy supply, distribution, cost, and use;
    (2) Flood control;
    (3) Navigation;
    (4) Water supply;
    (5) Air quality; and
    (6) Preservation of other aspects of environmental quality.


<R05>
Sec. 221.74  Has OMB approved the information collection provisions
of this subpart?

    Yes. This rule contains provisions that would collect information 
from the public. It therefore requires approval by the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, 
44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. (PRA). According to the PRA, a Federal agency may 
not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a 
collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB 
control number that indicates OMB approval. OMB has reviewed the 
information collection in this rule and approved it under OMB control 
number 1094-0001.

Fisheries Service, NOAA, 9721 Executive Center Drive N., St. Petersburg, 
FL 33702-2432.
    Southwest Regional Administrator means the Regional Administrator 
for the Southwest Region of the National Marine Fisheries Service,

    Stretched mesh size means the distance between the centers of the 
two opposite knots in the same mesh when pulled taut.
    Summer flounder means the species Paralichthys dentatus.
    Summer flounder fishery-sea turtle protection area means all 
offshore waters, bounded on the north by a line along 37[deg]05[min] N. 
lat. (Cape Charles, VA) and bounded on the south by a line extending in 
a direction of 135[deg]34[min]55[sec] from true north from the North 
Carolina-South Carolina land boundary, as marked by the border station 
on Bird Island at 33[deg]51[min]07.9[sec] N. lat., 
078[deg]32[min]32.6[sec] W. long.(the North Carolina-South Carolina 
border).
    Summer flounder trawler means any vessel that is equipped with one 
or more bottom trawl nets and that is capable of, or used for, fishing 
for flounder or whose on-board or landed catch of flounder is more than 
100 lb (45.4 kg).
    Take means to harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, 
capture, or collect, or to attempt to harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, 
wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect.
    Taper, in reference to the webbing used in trawls, means the angle 
of a cut used to shape the webbing, expressed as the ratio between the 
cuts that reduce the width of the webbing by cutting into the panel of 
webbing through one row of twine (bar cuts) and the cuts that extend the 
length of the panel of webbing by cutting straight aft through two 
adjoining rows of twine (point cuts). For example, sequentially cutting 
through the lengths of twine on opposite sides of a mesh, leaving an 
uncut edge of twines all lying in the same line, produces a relatively 
strong taper called ``all-bars''; making a sequence of 4-bar cuts 
followed by 1-point cut produces a more gradual taper called ``4 bars to 
1 point'' or ``4b1p''; similarly, making a sequence of 2-bar cuts 
followed by 1-point cut produces a still more gradual taper called 
``2b1p''; and making a sequence of cuts straight aft does not reduce the 
width of the panel and is called a ``straight'' or ``all-points'' cut.
    Taut means a condition in which there is no slack in the net 
webbing.
    Test net, or try net, means a net pulled for brief periods of time 
just before, or during, deployment of the primary net(s) in order to 
test for shrimp concentrations or determine fishing conditions (e.g., 
presence or absence of bottom debris, jellyfish, bycatch, seagrasses, 
etc.).
    Tongue means any piece of webbing along the top, center, leading 
edge of a trawl, whether lying behind or ahead of the headrope, to which 
a towing bridle can be attached for purposes of pulling the trawl net 
and/or adjusting the shape of the trawl.

    Triple-wing trawl means a trawl with a tongue on the top, center, 
leading edge of the trawl and an additional tongue along the bottom, 
center, leading edge of the trawl.
    Two-seam trawl means a design of shrimp trawl in which the main body 
of the trawl is formed from a top and a bottom panel of webbing that are 
directly attached to each other down the sides of the trawl.

    Underway with respect to a vessel, means that the vessel is not at 
anchor, or made fast to the shore, or aground.
    Unforeseen circumstances means changes in circumstances affecting a 
species or geographic area covered by a conservation plan that could not 
reasonably have been anticipated by plan developers and NMFS at the time 
of the conservation plan's negotiation and development, and that result 
in a substantial and adverse change in the status of the covered 
species.
    Vessel means a vehicle used, or capable of being used, as a means of 
transportation on water which includes every description of watercraft,

Sec. 222.103  Federal/state cooperation in the conservation of 
endangered and threatened species.

    (a) Application for and renewal of cooperative agreements. (1) The 
Assistant Administrator may enter into a Cooperative Agreement with any 
state that establishes and maintains an active and adequate program for 
the conservation of resident species listed as endangered or threatened. 
In order for a state program to be deemed an adequate and active 
program, the Assistant Administrator must find, and annually reconfirm 
that the criteria of either sections 6(c)(1) (A) through (E) or sections 
6(c)(1) (i) and (ii) of the Act have been satisfied.
    (2) Following receipt of an application by a state for a Cooperative 
Agreement with a copy of a proposed state program, and a determination 
by the Assistant Administrator that the state program is adequate and 
active, the Assistant Administrator shall enter into an Agreement with 
the state.
    (3) The Cooperative Agreement, as well as the Assistant 
Administrator's finding upon which it is based, must be reconfirmed 
annually to ensure that it reflects new laws, species lists, rules or 
regulations, and programs and to demonstrate that it is still adequate 
and active.
    (b) Allocation and availability of funds. (1) The Assistant 
Administrator shall allocate funds, appropriated for the purpose of 
carrying out section 6 of the Act, to various states using the following 
as the basis for the determination:
    (i) The international commitments of the United States to protect 
endangered or threatened species;
    (ii) The readiness of a state to proceed with a conservation program 
consistent with the objectives and purposes of the Act;
    (iii) The number of federally listed endangered and threatened 
species within a state;
    (iv) The potential for restoring endangered and threatened species 
within a state; and
    (v) The relative urgency to initiate a program to restore and 
protect an endangered or threatened species in terms of survival of the 
species.
    (2) Funds allocated to a state are available for obligation during 
the fiscal year for which they are allocated and until the close of the 
succeeding fiscal year. Obligation of allocated funds occurs when an 
award or contract is signed by the Assistant Administrator.
    (c) Financial assistance and payments. (1) A state must enter into a 
Cooperative Agreement before financial assistance is approved by the 
Assistant Administrator for endangered or threatened species projects. 
Specifically, the Agreement must contain the actions

[[Page 127]]

that are to be taken by the Assistant Administrator and/or by the state, 
the benefits to listed species expected to be derived from these 
actions, and the estimated cost of these actions.
    (2) Subsequent to such Agreement, the Assistant Administrator may 
further agree with a state to provide financial assistance in the 
development and implementation of acceptable projects for the 
conservation of endangered and threatened species. Documents to provide 
financial assistance will consist of an application for Federal 
assistance and an award or a contract. The availability of Federal funds 
shall be contingent upon the continued existence of the Cooperative 
Agreement and compliance with all applicable Federal regulations for 
grant administration and cost accounting principles.
    (3)(i) The payment of the Federal share of costs incurred when 
conducting activities included under a contract or award shall not 
exceed 75 percent of the program costs as stated in the agreement. 
However, the Federal share may be increased to 90 percent when two or 
more states having a common interest in one or more endangered or 
threatened resident species, the conservation of which may be enhanced 
by cooperation of such states, jointly enter into an agreement with the 
Assistant Administrator.
    (ii) The state share of program costs may be in the form of cash or 
in-kind contributions, including real property, subject to applicable 
Federal regulations.
    (4) Payments of funds, including payment of such preliminary costs 
and expenses as may be incurred in connection with projects, shall not 
be made unless all necessary or required documents are first submitted 
to and approved by the Assistant Administrator. Payments shall only be 
made for expenditures reported and certified by the state agency. 
Payments shall be made only to the state office or official designated 
by the state agency and authorized under the laws of the state to 
receive public funds for the state.

material for such product was held by such certificate holder on October 
13, 1982.
    (3) Any person engaged in activities otherwise prohibited under the 
Act or regulations shall bear the burden of proving that the exemption 
or certificate is applicable, was granted, and was valid and in force at 
the time of the otherwise prohibited activity.
    (b) Certificates of Exemption issued under this subpart are no 
longer available to new applicants. However, the Assistant Administrator 
may renew or modify existing Certificates of Exemptions as authorized by 
the provisions set forth in this subpart.
    (c) Any person granted a Certificate of Exemption, including a 
renewal, under this subpart, upon a sale of any exempted pre-Act 
endangered species part, must provide the purchaser in writing with a 
description (including full identification number) of the part sold and 
must inform the purchaser in writing of the purchaser's obligation under 
paragraph (b) of this section, including the address given in the 
certificate to which the purchaser's report is to be sent.
    (d) Any purchaser of pre-Act endangered species parts included in a 
valid Certificate of Exemption, unless an ultimate user, within 30 days

paragraph, means any person who acquired such endangered species part or 
product for his or her own consumption or for other personal use 
(including gifts) and not for resale.


<R05>
Sec. 222.202  Certificate renewal.

    (a) Any person to whom a Certificate of Exemption has been issued by 
the National Marine Fisheries Service may apply to the Assistant 
Administrator for renewal of such certificate. Any person holding a 
valid Certificate of Exemption which was renewed after October 13, 1982, 
and was in effect on March 31, 1988, may apply to the Secretary for one 
renewal for a period not to exceed 5 years.
    (b) The sufficiency of the application shall be determined by the 
Assistant Administrator in accordance with the requirements of paragraph 
(c) of this section. At least 15 days should be allowed for processing. 
When an application for a renewal has been received and deemed 
sufficient, the Assistant Administrator shall issue a Certificate of 
Renewal to the applicant as soon as practicable.
    (c) The following information will be used as the basis for 
determining whether an application for renewal of a Certificate of 
Exemption is complete:
    (1) Title: Application for Renewal of Certificate of Exemption.

5-year period beginning on the date of the expiration of the previous 
renewal of the certificate of exemption.
    (5)(i) A complete and detailed updated inventory of all pre-Act 
endangered species parts for which the applicant seeks exemption. Each 
item on the inventory must be identified by the following information: A 
unique serial number; the weight of the item to the nearest whole gram; 
and a detailed description sufficient to permit ready identification of 
the item. Small lots, not exceeding five pounds (2,270 grams), of scraps 
or raw material, which may include or consist of one or more whole raw 
whale teeth, may be identified by a single serial number and total 
weight. All finished scrimshaw items subsequently made from a given lot 
of scrap may be identified by the lot serial number plus additional 
digits to signify the piece number of the individual finished item. 
Identification numbers will be in the following format: 00-000000-0000. 
The first two digits will be the last two digits of the appropriate 
certificate of exemption number; the next six digits, the serial number 
of the individual piece or lot of scrap or raw material; and the last 
four digits, where applicable, the piece number of an item made from a 
lot of scrap or raw material. The serial numbers for each certificate 
holder's inventory must begin with 000001, and piece numbers, where 
applicable, must begin with 0001 for each separate lot.
    (ii) Identification numbers may be affixed to inventory items by any 
means, including, but not limited to, etching the number into the item, 
attaching a label or tag bearing the number to the item, or sealing the 
item in a plastic bag, wrapper or other container bearing the number. 
The number must remain affixed to the item until the item is sold to an 
ultimate user, as defined in Sec. 222.201(d).
    (iii) No renewals will be issued for scrimshaw products in excess of 
any quantities declared in the original application for a Certificate of 
Exemption.
    (6) A Certification in the following language: I hereby certify that 
the foregoing information is complete,

[[Page 129]]

true, and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief. I understand 
that this information is submitted for the purpose of obtaining a 
renewal of my Certificate of Exemption under the Endangered Species Act, 
as amended, and the Department of Commerce regulations issued 
thereunder, and that any false statement may subject me to the criminal 
penalties of 18 U.S.C. 1001, or to the penalties under the Act.
    (7) Signature of the applicant.
    (d) Upon receipt of an incomplete or improperly executed application 
for renewal, the applicant shall be notified of the deficiency in the 
application for renewal. If the application for renewal is not corrected 
and received by the Assistant Administrator within 30 days following the 
date of receipt of notification, the application for renewal shall be 
considered abandoned.


<R05>
Sec. 222.203  Modification, amendment, suspension, and revocation of
certificates.

    (a) When circumstances have changed so that an applicant or 
certificate holder desires to have any material, term, or condition of 
the application or certificate modified, the applicant or certificate 
holder must submit in writing full justification and supporting 
information in conformance with the provisions of this part.
    (b) All certificates are issued subject to the condition that the 
Assistant Administrator reserves the right to amend the provisions of a 
Certificate of Exemption for just cause at any time. Such amendments 
take effect on the date of notification, unless otherwise specified.
    (c) Any violation of the applicable provisions of parts 222, 223, or 
224 of this chapter, or of the Act, or of a condition of the certificate 
may subject the certificate holder to penalties provided in the Act and 
to suspension, revocation, or modification of the Certificate of 
Exemption, as provided in subpart D of 15 CFR part 904.


<R05>
Sec. 222.204  Administration of certificates.

    (a) The Certificate of Exemption covers the business or activity 
specified in the Certificate of Exemption at the address described 
therein. No Certificate of Exemption is required to cover a separate 
warehouse facility used by the certificate holder solely for storage of 
pre-Act endangered species parts, if the records required by this 
subpart are maintained at the address specified in the Certificate of 
Exemption served by the warehouse or storage facility.
    (b) Certificates of Exemption issued under this subpart are not 
transferable. However, in the event of the lease, sale, or other 
transfer of the operations or activity authorized by the Certificate of 
Exemption, the successor is not required to obtain a new Certificate of 
Exemption prior to commencing such operations or activity. In such case, 
the successor will be treated as a purchaser and must comply with the 
record and reporting requirements set forth in Sec. 222.201(d).
    (c) The Certificate of Exemption holder must notify the Assistant 
Administrator, in writing, of any change in address, in trade name of 
the business, or in activity specified in the certificate. The Assistant 
Administrator must be notified within 10 days of a change of address, 
and within 30 days of a change in trade name. The certificate with the 
change of address or in trade name must be endorsed by the Assistant 
Administrator, who shall provide an amended certificate to the person to 
whom it was issued. A certificate holder who seeks amendment of a 
certificate may continue all authorized activities while awaiting action 
by the Assistant Administrator.
    (d) A Certificate of Exemption issued under this subpart confers no 
right or privilege to conduct a business or an activity contrary to 
state or other law. Similarly, compliance with the provisions of any 
state or other law affords no immunity under any Federal laws or 
regulations of any other Federal agency.
    (e) Any person authorized to enforce the Act may enter the premises 
of any Certificate of Exemption holder or of any purchaser during 
business hours, including places of storage, for the purpose of 
inspecting or of examining any records or documents and any endangered 
species parts.
    (f) The records pertaining to pre-Act endangered species parts 
prescribed by this subpart shall be in permanent

[[Page 130]]

form and shall be retained at the address shown on the Certificate of 
Exemption or at the principal address of a purchaser in the manner 
prescribed by this subpart.
    (g)(1) Holders of Certificates of Exemption must maintain records of 
all pre-Act endangered species parts they receive, sell, transfer, 
distribute or dispose of otherwise. Purchasers of pre-Act endangered 
species parts, unless ultimate users, as defined in Sec. 222.201(d), 
must similarly maintain records of all such parts or products they 
receive.
    (2) Such records referred to in paragraph (g)(1) of this section may 
consist of invoices or other commercial records, which must be filed in 
an orderly manner separate from other commercial records maintained and 
be readily available for inspection. Such records must show the name and 
address of the purchaser, seller, or other transferor; show the type, 
quantity, and identity of the part or product; show the date of such 
sale or transfer; and be retained, in accordance with the requirements 
of this subpart, for a period of not less than 3 years following the 
date of sale or transfer. Each pre-Act endangered species part will be 
identified by its number on the updated inventory required to renew a 
Certificate of Exemption.
    (i) Each Certificate of Exemption holder must submit a quarterly 
report (to the address given in the certificate) containing all record 
information required by paragraph (g)(2) of this section, on all 
transfers of pre-Act endangered species parts made in the previous 
calendar quarter, or such other record information the Assistant 
Administrator may specify from time to time.
    (ii) Quarterly reports are due on January 15, April 15, July 15, and 
October 15.
    (3) The Assistant Administrator may authorize the record information 
to be submitted in a manner other than that prescribed in paragraph 
(g)(2) of this section when the record holder demonstrates that an 
alternate method of reporting is reasonably necessary and will not 
hinder the effective administration or enforcement of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 222.205  Import and export requirements.

    (a) Any fish and wildlife subject to the jurisdiction of the 
National Marine Fisheries Service and is intended for importation into 
or exportation from the United States, shall not be imported or exported 
except at a port(s) designated by the Secretary of the Interior. 
Shellfish and fishery products that are neither endangered nor 
threatened species and that are imported for purposes of human or animal 
consumption or taken in waters under the jurisdiction of the United 
States or on the high seas for recreational purposes are excluded from 
this requirement. The Secretary of the Interior may permit the 
importation or exportation at nondesignated ports in the interest of the 
health or safety of the species for other reasons if the Secretary deems 
it appropriate and consistent with the purpose of facilitating 
enforcement of the Act and reducing the costs thereof. Importers and 
exporters are advised to see 50 CFR part 14 for importation and 
exportation requirements and information.
    (b) No pre-Act endangered species part shall be imported into the 
United States. A Certificate of Exemption issued in accordance with the 
provisions of this subpart confers no right or privilege to import into 
the United States any such part.
    (c)(1) Any person exporting from the United States any pre-Act 
endangered species part must possess a valid Certificate of Exemption 
issued in accordance with the provisions of this subpart. In addition, 
the exporter must provide to the Assistant Administrator, in writing, 
not less than 10 days prior to shipment, the following information: The 
name and address of the foreign consignee, the intended port of 
exportation, and a complete description of the parts to be exported. No 
shipment may be made until these requirements are met by the exporter.
    (2) The exporter must send a copy of the Certificate of Exemption, 
and any endorsements thereto, to the District Director of Customs at the 
port of exportation, which must precede or accompany the shipment in 
order to permit the appropriate inspection prior to

[[Page 131]]

lading. Upon receipt, the District Director may order such inspection, 
as deemed necessary; the District will clear the merchandise for export, 
prior to the lading of the merchandise. If they are satisfied that the 
shipment is proper and complies with the information contained in the 
certificate and any endorsement thereto. The certificate, and any 
endorsements, will be forwarded to the Chief of the Office of 
Enforcement for NMFS.
    (3) No pre-Act endangered species part in compliance with the 
requirements of this subpart may be exported except at a port or ports 
designated by the Secretary of the Interior, pursuant to Sec. 222.103.
    (4) Notwithstanding any provision of this subpart, it shall not be 
required that the Assistant Administrator authorizes the transportation 
in interstate or foreign commerce of pre-Act endangered species parts.

    Effective Date Note: At 64 FR 14054, Mar. 23, 1999, part 222 was 
revised, effective Mar. 23, 1999, with the exception of Sec. 222.205, 
paragraphs (c)(1) and (2), which contain information collection and 
recordkeeping requirements and will not become effective until approval 
has been given by the Office of Management and Budget.


<R04>
                   Subpart C_General Permit Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 222.301  General requirements.

    (a)(1) The regulations in this subpart C provide uniform rules and 
procedures for application, issuance, renewal, conditions, and general 
administration of permits issuable pursuant to parts 222, 223, and 224 
of this chapter. While this section provides generic rules and 
procedures applicable to all permits, other sections may provide more 
specific rules and procedures with respect to certain types of permits. 
In such cases, the requirements in all applicable sections must be 
satisfied.
    (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the Assistant 
Administrator may approve variations from the requirements of parts 222, 
223, and 224 of this chapter when the Assistant Administrator finds that 
an emergency exists and that the proposed variations will not hinder 
effective administration of those parts and will not be unlawful. Other 
sections within parts 222, 223, and 224 of this chapter may allow for a 
waiver or variation of specific requirements for emergency situations, 
upon certain conditions. In such cases, those conditions must be 
satisfied in order for the waiver or variation to be lawful.
    (b) No person shall take, import, export or engage in any other 
prohibited activity involving any species of fish or wildlife under the 
jurisdiction of the Secretary of Commerce that has been determined to be 
endangered under the Act, or that has been determined to be threatened 
and for which the prohibitions of section 9(a)(1) of the Act have been 
applied by regulation, without a valid permit issued pursuant to these 
regulations. The permit shall entitle the person to whom it is issued to 
engage in the activity specified in the permit, subject to the 
limitations of the Act and the regulations in parts 222, 223, and 224 of 
this chapter, for the period stated on the permit, unless sooner 
modified, suspended or revoked.
    (c) Each person intending to engage in an activity for which a 
permit is required by parts 222, 223, and 224 of this chapter or by the 
Act shall, before commencing such activity, obtain a valid permit 
authorizing such activity. Any person who desires to obtain permit 
privileges authorized by parts 222, 223, and 224 of this chapter must 
apply for such permit in accordance with the requirements of these 
sections. If the information required for each specific, permitted 
activity is included, one application may be accepted for all permits 
required, and a single permit may be issued.
    (d)(1) Any permit issued under these regulations must be in the 
possession of the person to whom it is issued (or of an agent of such 
person) while any animal subject to the permit is in the possession of 
such person or agent. Specifically, a person or his/her agent must be in 
possession of a permit during the time of the authorized taking, 
importation, exportation, or of any other act and during the period of 
any transit incident to such taking, importation, exportation, or to any 
other act.
    (2) A duplicate copy of the issued permit must be physically 
attached to the

[[Page 132]]

tank, container, package, enclosure, or other means of containment, in 
which the animal is placed for purposes of storage, transit, 
supervision, or care.
    (e) The authorizations on the face of a permit setting forth 
specific times, dates, places, methods of taking, numbers and kinds of 
fish or wildlife, location of activity, authorize certain circumscribed 
transactions, or otherwise permit a specifically limited matter, are to 
be strictly construed and shall not be interpreted to permit similar or 
related matters outside the scope of strict construction.
    (f) Permits shall not be altered, erased, or mutilated, and any 
permit which has been altered, erased, or mutilated shall immediately 
become invalid.
    (g) Any permit issued under parts 222, 223, and 224 of this chapter 
shall be displayed for inspection, upon request, to an authorized 
officer, or to any other person relying upon its existence.
    (h) Permittees may be required to file reports of the activities 
conducted under the permit. Any such reports shall be filed not later 
than March 31 for the preceding calendar year ending December 31, or any 
portion thereof, during which a permit was in force, unless the 
regulations of parts 222, 223, or 224 of this chapter or the provisions 
of the permit set forth other reporting requirements.
    (i) From the date of issuance of the permit, the permittee shall 
maintain complete and accurate records of any taking, possession, 
transportation, sale, purchase, barter, exportation, or importation of 
fish or wildlife pursuant to such permit. Such records shall be kept 
current and shall include the names and addresses of persons with whom 
any fish or wildlife has been purchased, sold, bartered, or otherwise 
transferred, and the date of such transaction, and such other 
information as may be required or appropriate. Such records, unless 
otherwise specified, shall be entered in books, legibly written in the 
English language. Such records shall be retained for 5 years from the 
date of issuance of the permit.
    (j) Any person holding a permit pursuant to parts 222, 223, and 224 
of this chapter shall allow the Assistant Administrator to enter the 
permit holder's premises at any reasonable hour to inspect any fish or 
wildlife held or to inspect, audit, or copy any permits, books, or 
records required to be kept by these regulations or by the Act. Such 
person shall display any permit issued pursuant to these regulations or 
to the Act upon request by an authorized officer or by any other person 
relying on its existence.


<R05>
Sec. 222.302  Procedure for obtaining permits.

    (a) Applications must be submitted to the Assistant Administrator, 
by letter containing all necessary information, attachments, 
certification, and signature, as specified by the regulations in parts 
222, 223, and 224 of this chapter, or by the Act. In no case, other than 
for emergencies pursuant to Sec. 222.301(a)(2), will applications be 
accepted either orally or by telephone.
    (b) Applications must be received by the Assistant Administrator at 
least 90 calendar days prior to the date on which the applicant desires 
to have the permit made effective, unless otherwise specified in the 
regulations or guidelines pertaining to a particular permit. The 
National Marine Fisheries Service will attempt to process applications 
deemed sufficient in the shortest possible time, but does not guarantee 
that the permit will be issued 90 days after notice of receipt of the 
application is published in the Federal Register.
    (c)(1) Upon receipt of an insufficiently or improperly executed 
application, the applicant shall be notified of the deficiency in the 
application. If the applicant fails to supply the deficient information 
or otherwise fails to correct the deficiency within 60 days following 
the date of notification, the application shall be considered abandoned.
    (2) The sufficiency of the application shall be determined by the 
Assistant Administrator in accordance with the requirements of this 
part. The Assistant Administrator, however, may waive any requirement 
for information or require any elaboration or further information deemed 
necessary.

<R05>
Sec. 222.303  Issuance of permits.

    (a)(1) No permit may be issued prior to the receipt of a written 
application unless an emergency pursuant to Sec. 222.301(a)(2) exists, 
and a written variation from the requirements is recorded by the 
National Marine Fisheries Service.
    (2) No representation of an employee or agent of the United States 
shall be construed as a permit unless it meets the requirements of a 
permit defined in Sec. 222.102.
    (3) Each permit shall bear a serial number. Upon renewal, such a 
number may be reassigned to the permittee to whom issued so long as the 
permittee maintains continuity of renewal.
    (b) When an application for a permit received by the Assistant 
Administrator is deemed sufficient, the Assistant Administrator shall, 
as soon as practicable, publish a notice in the Federal Register. 
Information received by the Assistant Administrator as a part of the 
application shall be available to the public as a matter of public 
record at every stage of the proceeding. An interested party, within 30 
days after the date of publication of such notice, may submit to the 
Assistant Administrator written data, views, or arguments with respect 
to the taking, importation, or to other action proposed in the 
application, and may request a hearing in connection with the action to 
be taken thereon.
    (c) If a request for a hearing is made within the 30-day period 
referred to in paragraph (b) of this section, or if the Assistant 
Administrator determines that a hearing would otherwise be advisable, 
the Assistant Administrator may, within 60 days after the date of 
publication of the notice referred to in paragraph (b) of this section, 
afford to such requesting party or parties an opportunity for a hearing. 
Such hearing shall also be open to participation by any interested 
members of the public. Notice of the date, time, and place of such 
hearing shall be published in the Federal Register not less than 15 days 
in advance of such hearing. Any interested person may appear at the 
hearing in person or through a representative and may submit any 
relevant material, data, views, comments, arguments, or exhibits. A 
summary record of the hearing shall be kept.
    (d) Except as provided in subpart D to 15 CFR part 904, as soon as 
practicable but not later than 30 days after the close of the hearing. 
If no hearing is held, as soon as practicable but not later than 30 days 
from the publication of the notice in the Federal Register, the 
Assistant Administrator shall issue or deny issuance of the permit. 
Notice of the decision of the Assistant Administrator shall be published 
in the Federal Register within 10 days after the date of the issuance or 
denial and indicate where copies of the permit, if issued, may be 
obtained.
    (e)(1) The Assistant Administrator shall issue the permit unless:
    (i) Denial of the permit has been made pursuant to subpart D to 15 
CFR part 904;
    (ii) The applicant has failed to disclose material or information 
required, or has made false statements as to any material fact, in 
connection with the application;
    (iii) The applicant has failed to demonstrate a valid justification 
for the permit or a showing of responsibility;
    (iv) The authorization requested potentially threatens a fish or 
wildlife population; or
    (v) The Assistant Administrator finds through further inquiry or 
investigation, or otherwise, that the applicant is not qualified.
    (2) The applicant shall be notified in writing of the denial of any 
permit request, and the reasons thereof. If authorized in the notice of 
denial, the applicant may submit further information or reasons why the 
permit should not be denied. Such further information shall not be 
considered a new application. The final action by the Assistant 
Administrator shall be considered the final administrative decision of 
the Department of Commerce.
    (f) If a permit is issued under Sec. 222.308, the Assistant 
Administrator shall publish notice thereof in the Federal Register, 
including the Assistant Administrator's finding that such permit--
    (1) Was applied for in good faith;
    (2) Will not operate to the disadvantage of such endangered species; 
and

[[Page 134]]

    (3) Will be consistent with the purposes and policy set forth in 
section 2 of the Act.
    (g) The Assistant Administrator may waive the 30-day period in an 
emergency situation where the health or life of an endangered animal is 
threatened and no reasonable alternative is available to the applicant. 
Notice of any such waiver shall be published by the Assistant 
Administrator in the Federal Register within 10 days following the 
issuance of the permit.


<R05>
Sec. 222.304  Renewal of permits.

    When the permit is renewable and a permittee intends to continue the 
activity described in the permit during any portion of the year ensuing 
its expiration, the permittee shall, unless otherwise notified in 
writing by the Assistant Administrator, file a request for permit 
renewal, together with a certified statement, verifying that the 
information in the original application is still currently correct. If 
the information is incorrect the permittee shall file a statement of all 
changes in the original application, accompanied by any required fee at 
least 30 days prior to the expiration of the permit. Any person holding 
a valid renewable permit, who has complied with the foregoing provision 
of this section, may continue such activities as were authorized by the 
expired permit until the renewal application is acted upon.


<R05>
Sec. 222.305  Rights of succession and transfer of permits.

    (a)(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, permits issued 
pursuant to parts 222, 223, and 224 of this chapter are not transferable 
or assignable. In the event that a permit authorizes certain business 
activities in connection with a business or commercial enterprise, which 
is then subject to any subsequent lease, sale or transfer, the successor 
to that enterprise must obtain a permit prior to continuing the 
permitted activity, with the exceptions provided in paragraphs (a)(2) 
and (a)(3) of this section.
    (2) Certain persons, other than the permittee, are granted the right 
to carry on a permitted activity for the remainder of the term of a 
current permit, provided that they furnish the permit to the issuing 
officer for endorsement within 90 days from the date the successor 
begins to carry on the activity. Such persons are the following:
    (i) The surviving spouse, child, executor, administrator, or other 
legal representative of a deceased permittee, and
    (ii) The receiver or trustee in bankruptcy or a court designated 
assignee for the benefit of creditors.
    (3) Incidental take permits issued under Sec. 222.307, and 
enhancement permits issued under Sec. 222.308, as part of a Safe Harbor 
Agreement with Assurances or Candidate Conservation Agreement with 
Assurances, may be transferred in whole or in part through a joint 
submission by the permittee and the proposed transferee, or in the case 
of a deceased permittee, the deceased permittee's legal representative 
and the proposed transferee, provided NMFS determines in writing that:
    (i) The proposed transferee meets all of the qualifications under 
parts 222, 223, or 224 (as applicable) for holding a permit;
    (ii) The proposed transferee has provided adequate written 
assurances that it will provide sufficient funding for the conservation 
plan or other agreement or plan associated with the permit and will 
implement the relevant terms and conditions of the permit, including any 
outstanding minimization and mitigation requirements; and
    (iii) The proposed transferee has provided such other information as 
NMFS determines is relevant to process the transfer.
    (b) Except as otherwise stated on the face of the permit, any person 
who is under the direct control of the permittee, or who is employed by 
or under contract to the permittee for purposes authorized by the 
permit, may carry out the activity authorized by the permit.

[64 FR 14054, Mar. 23, 1999, as amended at 67 FR 57973, Sept. 13, 2002]

    Effective Date Note: At 64 FR 14054, Mar. 23, 1999, part 222 was 
revised, effective Mar. 23, 1999, with the exception of Sec. 222.305, 
paragraph (a), which contains information collection and recordkeeping 
requirements and will not become effective until approval has been given 
by the Office of Management and Budget.

<R05>
Sec. 222.306  Modification, amendment, suspension, cancellation, 
and revocation of permits.

    (a) When circumstances have changed so that an applicant or a 
permittee desires to have any term or condition of the application or 
permit modified, the applicant or permittee must submit in writing full 
justification and supporting information in conformance with the 
provisions of this part and the part under which the permit has been 
issued or requested. Such applications for modification are subject to 
the same issuance criteria as original applications.
    (b) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a) of this 
section, a permittee may change the mailing address or trade name under 
which business is conducted without obtaining a new permit or being 
subject to the same issuance criteria as original permits. The permittee 
must notify the Assistant Administrator, in writing within 30 days, of 
any change in address or of any change in the trade name for the 
business or activity specified in the permit. The permit with the change 
of address or in trade name must be endorsed by the Assistant 
Administrator, who shall provide an amended permit to the person to whom 
it was issued.
    (c) All permits are issued subject to the condition that the 
National Marine Fisheries Service reserves the right to amend the 
provisions of a permit for just cause at any time during its term. Such 
amendments take effect on the date of notification, unless otherwise 
specified.
    (d) When any permittee discontinues the permitted activity, the 
permittee shall, within 30 days thereof, mail the permit and a request 
for cancellation to the issuing officer, and the permit shall be deemed 
void upon receipt. No refund of any part of an amount paid as a permit 
fee shall be made when the operations of the permittee are, for any 
reason, discontinued during the tenure of an issued permit.
    (e) Any violation of the applicable provisions of parts 222, 223, or 
224 of this chapter, or of the Act, or of a term or condition of the 
permit may subject the permittee to both the penalties provided in the 
Act and suspension, revocation, or amendment of the permit, as provided 
in subpart D to 15 CFR part 904.


<R05>
Sec. 222.307  Permits for incidental taking of species.

    (a) Scope. (1) The Assistant Administrator may issue permits to take 
endangered and threatened species incidentally to an otherwise lawful 
activity under section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Act. The regulations in this 
section apply to all endangered species, and those threatened species 
for which the prohibitions of section 9(a)(1) of the Act, under the 
jurisdiction of the Secretary of Commerce, apply.
    (2) If the applicant represents an individual or a single entity, 
such as a corporation, the Assistant Administrator will issue an 
individual incidental take permit. If the applicant represents a group 
or organization whose members conduct the same or a similar activity in 
the same geographical area with similar impacts on listed species for 
which a permit is required, the Assistant Administrator will issue a 
general incidental take permit. To be covered by a general incidental 
take permit, each individual conducting the activity must have a 
certificate of inclusion issued under paragraph (f) of this section.
    (b) Permit application procedures. Applications should be sent to 
the Assistant Administrator. The Assistant Administrator shall determine 
the sufficiency of the application in accordance with the requirements 
of this section. At least 120 days should be allowed for processing. 
Each application must be signed and dated and must include the 
following:
    (1) The type of application, either:
    (i) Application for an Individual Incidental Take Permit under the 
Act; or
    (ii) Application for a General Incidental Take Permit under the Act;
    (2) The name, address, and telephone number of the applicant. If the 
applicant is a partnership or a corporate entity or is representing a 
group or an organization, the applicable details;
    (3) The species or stocks, by common and scientific name, and a 
description of the status, distribution, seasonal distribution, habitat 
needs, feeding

[[Page 136]]

habits and other biological requirements of the affected species or 
stocks;
    (4) A detailed description of the proposed activity, including the 
anticipated dates, duration, and specific location. If the request is 
for a general incidental take permit, an estimate of the total level of 
activity expected to be conducted;
    (5) A conservation plan, based on the best scientific and commercial 
data available, which specifies the following:
    (i) The anticipated impact (i.e., amount, extent, and type of 
anticipated taking) of the proposed activity on the species or stocks;
    (ii) The anticipated impact of the proposed activity on the habitat 
of the species or stocks and the likelihood of restoration of the 
affected habitat;
    (iii) The steps (specialized equipment, methods of conducting 
activities, or other means) that will be taken to monitor, minimize, and 
mitigate such impacts, and the funding available to implement such 
measures;
    (iv) The alternative actions to such taking that were considered and 
the reasons why those alternatives are not being used; and
    (v) A list of all sources of data used in preparation of the plan, 
including reference reports, environmental assessments and impact 
statements, and personal communications with recognized experts on the 
species or activity who may have access to data not published in current 
literature.
    (c) Issuance criteria. (1) In determining whether to issue a permit, 
the Assistant Administrator will consider the following:
    (i) The status of the affected species or stocks;
    (ii) The potential severity of direct, indirect, and cumulative 
impacts on the species or stocks and habitat as a result of the proposed 
activity;
    (iii) The availability of effective monitoring techniques;
    (iv) The use of the best available technology for minimizing or 
mitigating impacts; and
    (v) The views of the public, scientists, and other interested 
parties knowledgeable of the species or stocks or other matters related 
to the application.
    (2) To issue the permit, the Assistant Administrator must find 
that--
    (i) The taking will be incidental;
    (ii) The applicant will, to the maximum extent practicable, monitor, 
minimize, and mitigate the impacts of such taking;
    (iii) The taking will not appreciably reduce the likelihood of the 
survival and recovery of the species in the wild;
    (iv) The applicant has amended the conservation plan to include any 
measures (not originally proposed by the applicant) that the Assistant 
Administrator determines are necessary or appropriate; and
    (v) There are adequate assurances that the conservation plan will be 
funded and implemented, including any measures required by the Assistant 
Administrator.
    (d) Permit conditions. In addition to the general conditions set 
forth in this part, every permit issued under this section will contain 
such terms and conditions as the Assistant Administrator deems necessary 
and appropriate, including, but not limited to the following:
    (1) Reporting requirements or rights of inspection for determining 
whether the terms and conditions are being complied with;
    (2) The species and number of animals covered;
    (3) The authorized method of taking;
    (4) The procedures to be used to handle or dispose of any animals 
taken; and
    (5) The payment of an adequate fee to the National Marine Fisheries 
Service to process the application.
    (e) Duration of permits. The duration of permits issued under this 
section will be such as to provide adequate assurances to the permit 
holder to commit funding necessary for the activities authorized by the 
permit, including conservation activities. In determining the duration 
of a permit, the Assistant Administrator will consider the duration of 
the proposed activities, as well as the possible positive and negative 
effects on listed species associated with issuing a permit of the 
proposed duration, including the extent to which the conservation plan 
is likely to enhance the habitat of the endangered species

[[Page 137]]

or to increase the long-term survivability of the species.
    (f) Certificates of inclusion. (1) Any individual who wishes to 
conduct an activity covered by a general incidental take permit must 
apply to the Assistant Administrator for a Certificate of Inclusion. 
Each application must be signed and dated and must include the 
following:
    (i) The general incidental take permit under which the applicant 
wants coverage;
    (ii) The name, address, and telephone number of the applicant. If 
the applicant is a partnership or a corporate entity, the applicable 
details;
    (iii) A description of the activity the applicant seeks to have 
covered under the general incidental take permit, including the 
anticipated dates, duration, and specific location; and
    (iv) A signed certification that the applicant has read and 
understands the general incidental take permit and the conservation 
plan, will comply with their terms and conditions, and will fund and 
implement applicable measures of the conservation plan.
    (2) To issue a Certificate of Inclusion, the Assistant Administrator 
must find that:
    (i) The applicant will be engaged in the activity covered by the 
general permit, and
    (ii) The applicant has made adequate assurances that the applicable 
measures of the conservation plan will be funded and implemented.
    (g) Assurances provided to permittee in case of changed or 
unforeseen circumstances. The assurances in this paragraph (g) apply 
only to incidental take permits issued in accordance with paragraph (c) 
of this section where the conservation plan is being properly 
implemented, and apply only with respect to species adequately covered 
by the conservation plan. These assurances cannot be provided to Federal 
agencies. This rule does not apply to incidental take permits issued 
prior to March 25, 1998. The assurances provided in incidental take 
permits issued prior to March 25, 1998, remain in effect, and those 
permits will not be revised as a result of this rulemaking.
    (1) Changed circumstances provided for in the plan. If additional 
conservation and mitigation measures are deemed necessary to respond to 
changed circumstances and were provided for in the plan's operating 
conservation program, the permittee will implement the measures 
specified in the plan.
    (2) Changed circumstances not provided for in the plan. If 
additional conservation and mitigation measures are deemed necessary to 
respond to changed circumstances and such measures were not provided for 
in the plan's operating conservation program, NMFS will not require any 
conservation and mitigation measures in addition to those provided for 
in the plan without the consent of the permittee, provided the plan is 
being properly implemented.
    (3) Unforeseen circumstances. (i) In negotiating unforeseen 
circumstances, NMFS will not require the commitment of additional land, 
water, or financial compensation or additional restrictions on the use 
of land, water, or other natural resources beyond the level otherwise 
agreed upon for the species covered by the conservation plan without the 
consent of the permittee.
    (ii) If additional conservation and mitigation measures are deemed 
necessary to respond to unforeseen circumstances, NMFS may require 
additional measures of the permittee where the conservation plan is 
being properly implemented. However, such additional measures are 
limited to modifications within any conserved habitat areas or to the 
conservation plan's operating conservation program for the affected 
species. The original terms of the conservation plan will be maintained 
to the maximum extent possible. Additional conservation and mitigation 
measures will not involve the commitment of additional land, water, or 
financial compensation or additional restrictions on the use of land, 
water, or other natural resources otherwise available for development or 
use under the original terms of the conservation plan without the 
consent of the permittee.
    (iii) NMFS has the burden of demonstrating that unforeseen 
circumstances exist, using the best scientific and commercial data 
available.

[[Page 138]]

These findings must be clearly documented and based upon reliable 
technical information regarding the status and habitat requirements of 
the affected species. NMFS will consider, but not be limited to, the 
following factors:
    (A) Size of the current range of the affected species;
    (B) Percentage of range adversely affected by the conservation plan;
    (C) Percentage of range conserved by the conservation plan;
    (D) Ecological significance of that portion of the range affected by 
the conservation plan;
    (E) Level of knowledge about the affected species and the degree of 
specificity of the species' conservation program under the conservation 
plan; and
    (F) Whether failure to adopt additional conservation measures would 
appreciably reduce the likelihood of survival and recovery of the 
affected species in the wild.
    (h) Nothing in this rule will be construed to limit or constrain the 
Assistant Administrator, any Federal, State, local, or Tribal government 
agency, or a private entity, from taking additional actions at his or 
her own expense to protect or conserve a species included in a 
conservation plan.

Sec. 222.309  Permits for listed species of sea turtles involving the
Fish and Wildlife Service.

    (a) This section establishes specific procedures for issuance of the 
following permits: scientific purposes or to enhance the propagation or 
survival of endangered or threatened species of sea turtles; zoological 
exhibition or educational purposes for threatened species of sea 
turtles; and permits that requires coordination with the Fish and 
Wildlife Service. The National Marine Fisheries Service maintains 
jurisdiction for such species in the marine environment. The Fish and 
Wildlife Service maintains jurisdiction for such species of sea turtles 
in the land environment.
    (b) For permits relating to any activity in the marine environment 
exclusively, permit applicants and permittees must comply with the 
regulations in parts 222, 223, and 224 of this chapter.
    (c) For permits relating to any activity in the land environment 
exclusively, permit applicants must submit applications to the Wildlife 
Permit Office (WPO) of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in accordance 
with either 50 CFR 17.22(a), if the species is endangered, or 50 CFR 
17.32(a), if the species is threatened.
    (d) For permits relating to any activity in both the land and marine 
environments, applicants must submit applications to the WPO. WPO will 
forward the application to NMFS for review and processing of those 
activities under its jurisdiction. Based on this review and processing, 
WPO will issue either a permit or a letter of denial in accordance with 
its own regulations.
    (e) For permits relating to any activity in a marine environment and 
that also requires a permit under the Convention on International Trade 
in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) (TIAS 8249, July 
1, 1975) (50 CFR part 23), applicants must submit applications to the 
WPO. WPO will forward the application to NMFS for review and processing, 
after which WPO will issue a combination ESA/CITES permit or a letter of 
denial.


<R05>
Sec. 222.310  Permit authority for designated agents and employees of
specified Federal and state agencies.

    (a) This section constitutes a programmatic permit, pursuant to 16 
U.S.C. 1539(a)(1)(A), that authorizes activities by agents and employees 
of Federal and state agencies, as described in paragraph (b) of this 
section, to aid stranded endangered sea turtles, and to salvage, collect 
data from, and dispose of, dead carcasses of endangered sea turtles in 
the marine environment. For purposes of this section, 'stranded' means 
endangered sea turtles, in the marine environment, that are alive but 
sick, injured, or entangled.
    (b) If any member of any endangered species of sea turtle is found 
stranded or dead in the marine environment, any agent or employee of the 
National Marine Fisheries Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service, the 
U.S. Coast Guard,

[[Page 142]]

or any other Federal land or water management agency, or any agent or 
employee of a state agency responsible for fish and wildlife who is 
designated by his or her agency for such purposes, may, when acting in 
the course of his or her official duties, take such endangered sea 
turtles if such taking is necessary to aid a stranded sea turtle, or 
dispose of or salvage a dead sea turtle, or collect data from a dead sea 
turtle which may be useful for scientific and educational purposes. Live 
turtles will be handled as described in Sec. 223.206(d)(1). Whenever 
possible, live sea turtles shall be returned to their aquatic 
environment as soon as possible. The following data collection 
activities for live turtles while they are in the marine environment are 
allowed:
    (1) Turtles may be flipper and passive integrated transponder (PIT) 
tagged, prior to release. Flipper tags would be applied to the trailing 
edge of either the front or rear flippers with standard tagging 
applicators after the tagging area has been cleaned with alcohol or 
iodine solution. PIT tags would be inserted according to best practice, 
approved scientific protocols, after cleaning the insertion site with 
alcohol or iodine solution. Before application of flipper tags or 
insertion of PIT tags, all flippers and the neck/shoulder area will be 
examined and scanned for the presence of any pre-existing flipper or PIT 
tags.
    (2) Turtles may also be weighed, measured, and photographed prior to 
release.
    (3) When handling turtles exhibiting fibropapilloma, all equipment 
(tagging equipment, tape measures, etc.) that comes in contact with the 
turtle shall be cleaned with a mild bleach solution.
    (c) Every action shall be reported in writing to the Assistant 
Administrator, or authorized representative, via the agency or 
institution designated by the state to record such events. Reports shall 
contain the following information:
    (1) Name and position of the official or employee involved;
    (2) Description of the sea turtle(s) involved including species and 
condition of the animal;
    (3) When applicable, description of entangling gear, its location on 
the turtle, and the amount of gear left on the turtle at release;
    (4) Method, date and location of disposal of the sea turtle(s), 
including, if applicable, where the sea turtle(s) has been retained in 
captivity; and
    (5) Such other information as the Assistant Administrator, or 
authorized representative, may require.

                     Subpart D_Observer Requirement

    Source: 72 FR 43185, Aug. 3, 2007, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 222.401  Observer requirement.

    Any United States fishing vessel, either commercial or recreational, 
which operates within the territorial seas or exclusive economic zone of 
the United States or on the high seas, or any fishing vessel that is 
otherwise subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, operating in 
a fishery that is identified through the annual determination process 
specified in Sec. 222.402 must carry aboard a NMFS-approved observer 
upon request by the NMFS Assistant Administrator, in consultation with 
NMFS Regional Administrators and Science Center Directors, as 
appropriate. NMFS and/or interested cooperating entities will pay direct 
costs for the observer. Owners and operators must comply with observer 
safety requirements specified at 50 CFR 600.725 and 50 CFR 600.746 and 
the terms and conditions specified in the written notification.


<R05>
Sec. 222.402  Annual determination of fisheries to be observed; 
notice and comment.

    (a) The Assistant Administrator, in consultation with Regional 
Administrators and Science Center Directors, will make an annual 
determination identifying which fisheries the agency intends to observe. 
This determination will be based on the extent to which:
    (1) The fishery operates in the same waters and at the same time as 
sea turtles are present;
    (2) The fishery operates at the same time or prior to elevated sea 
turtle strandings; or

[[Page 143]]

    (3) The fishery uses a gear or technique that is known or likely to 
result in incidental take of sea turtles based on documented or reported 
takes in the same or similar fisheries; and
    (4) NMFS intends to monitor the fishery and anticipates that it will 
have the funds to do so.
    (b) The Assistant Administrator shall publish the proposed 
determination and any final determination in the Federal Register. 
Public comment will be sought at the time of publication of the proposed 
determination. In addition, a written notification of the final 
determination will be sent to the address specified for the vessel in 
either the NMFS or state fishing permit application, or to the address 
specified for registration or documentation purposes, or such 
notification will be otherwise served on the owners or operator of the 
vessel. Additionally, NMFS will notify state agencies and provide 
notification through publication in local newspapers, radio broadcasts, 
and any other means as appropriate. The proposed and any final 
determinations will include, to the extent practicable, information on 
fishing sector, targeted gear type, target fishery, temporal and 
geographic scope of coverage, or other information, as appropriate.
    (c) Fisheries listed on the most recent annual Marine Mammal 
Protection Act List of Fisheries in any given year, in accordance with 
16 U.S.C. 1387, will serve as the comprehensive set of commercial 
fisheries to be considered for inclusion in the annual determination. 
Recreational fisheries may also be included in the annual determination.
    (d) Publication of the proposed and final determinations should be 
coordinated to the extent possible with the annual Marine Mammal 
Protection Act List of Fisheries process as specified at 50 CFR 229.8.
    (e) Inclusion of a fishery in a proposed or final determination does 
not constitute a conclusion by NMFS that those participating in the 
fishery are illegally taking sea turtles.


<R05>
Sec. 222.403  Duration of selection; effective date.

    (a) Fisheries included in the final annual determination in a given 
year will remain eligible for observer coverage under this rule for five 
years, without need for NMFS to include the fishery in the intervening 
proposed annual determinations, to enable the design of an appropriate 
sampling program and to ensure collection of scientific data. If NMFS 
wishes to continue observations beyond the fifth year, NMFS must include 
the fishery in the proposed annual determination and seek comment, prior 
to the expiration of the fifth year.
    (b) A 30-day delay in effective date for implementing observer 
coverage will follow the annual notification, except for those fisheries 
that were included in a previous determination within the preceding five 
years or where the AA has determined that there is good cause pursuant 
to the Administrative Procedure Act to make the rule effective without a 
30-day delay.


<R05>
Sec. 222.404  Observer program sampling.

    (a) During the program design, NMFS would be guided by the following 
standards in the distribution and placement of observers among fisheries 
and vessels in a particular fishery:
    (1) The requirements to obtain the best available scientific 
information;
    (2) The requirement that assignment of observers is fair and 
equitable among fisheries and among vessels in a fishery;
    (3) The requirement that no individual person or vessel, or group of 
persons or vessels, be subject to inappropriate, excessive observer 
coverage; and
    (4) The need to minimize costs and avoid duplication, where 
practicable.
    (b) Consistent with 16 U.S.C. 1881(b), vessels where the facilities 
for accommodating an observer or carrying out observer functions are so 
inadequate or unsafe (due to size or quality of equipment, for example) 
that the health or safety of the observer or the safe operation of the 
vessel would be jeopardized, would not be required to take observers 
under this rule.

commercial fisheries can be authorized in compliance with sections 
101(a)(5) and 118 of the Marine Mammal Protection Act.
    (b) Exceptions--(1) Permits. The Assistant Administrator may issue 
permits authorizing activities that would otherwise be prohibited under 
paragraph (a) of this section in accordance with and subject to the 
provisions of part 222, subpart C--General Permit Procedures.

[[Page 183]]

    (2) Official activities. The taking of Steller sea lions must be 
reported within 30 days to the Regional Administrator, Alaska Region. 
Paragraph (a) of this section does not prohibit or restrict a Federal, 
state or local government official, or his or her designee, who is 
acting in the course of official duties from:
    (i) Taking a Steller sea lion in a humane manner, if the taking is 
for the protection or welfare of the animal, the protection of the 
public health and welfare, or the nonlethal removal of nuisance animals; 
or
    (ii) Entering the buffer areas to perform activities that are 
necessary for national defense, or the performance of other legitimate 
governmental activities.
    (3) Subsistence takings by Alaska natives. Paragraph (a) of this 
section does not apply to the taking of Steller sea lions for 
subsistence purposes under section 10(e) of the Act.
    (4) Emergency situations. Paragraph (a)(2) of this section does not 
apply to an emergency situation in which compliance with that provision 
presents a threat to the health, safety, or life of a person or presents 
a significant threat to the vessel or property.
    (5) Exemptions. Paragraph (a)(2) of this section does not apply to 
any activity authorized by a prior written exemption from the Director, 
Alaska Region, National Marine Fisheries Service. Concurrently with the 
issuance of any exemption, the Assistant Administrator will publish 
notice of the exemption in the Federal Register. An exemption may be 
granted only if the activity will not have a significant adverse affect 
on Steller sea lions, the activity has been conducted historically or 
traditionally in the buffer zones, and there is no readily available and 
acceptable alternative to or site for the activity.
    (6) Navigational transit. Paragraph (a)(2) of this section does not 
prohibit a vessel in transit from passing through a strait, narrows, or 
passageway listed in this paragraph if the vessel proceeds in continuous

<R05>
Sec. 223.203  Anadromous fish.

    Available guidance documents cited in the regulatory text are listed 
in Appendix A to this section.
    (a) Prohibitions. The prohibitions of section 9(a)(1) of the ESA (16 
U.S.C. 1538(a)(1)) relating to endangered species apply to anadromous 
fish with an intact adipose fin that are part of the threatened species 
of salmonids listed in Sec. 223.102(a).
    (b) Limits on the prohibitions. The limits to the prohibitions of 
paragraph (a) of this section relating to threatened species of 
salmonids listed in Sec. 223.102(a) are described in the following 
paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(13):
    (1) The exceptions of section 10 of the ESA (16 U.S.C. 1539) and 
other exceptions under the Act relating to endangered species, including 
regulations in part 222 of this chapter implementing such exceptions, 
also apply to the threatened species of salmonids listed in Sec. 
223.102(a).
    (2) The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to 
Oregon Coast coho salmon, listed in Sec. 223.102(a)(24), do not apply 
to activities specified in an application for a permit for scientific

[[Page 184]]

purposes or to enhance the conservation or survival of the species, 
provided that the application has been received by the Assistant 
Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA), no later than June 10, 2008. The 
prohibitions of this section apply to these activities upon the 
Assistant Administrator's rejection of the application as insufficient, 
upon issuance or denial of a permit, or March 31, 2009, whichever occurs 
earliest.
    (3) The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to 
threatened species of salmonids listed in Sec. 223.102(a) do not apply 
to any employee or designee of NMFS, the United States Fish and Wildlife 
Service, any Federal land management agency, the Idaho Department of 
Fish and Game (IDFG), Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW), 
the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW), California Department 
of Fish and Game (CDFG), or of any other governmental entity that has 
co-management authority for the listed salmonids, when the employee or 
designee, acting in the course of his or her official duties, takes a 
threatened salmonid without a permit if such action is necessary to:
    (i) Aid a sick, injured, or stranded salmonid,
    (ii) Dispose of a dead salmonid, or
    (iii) Salvage a dead salmonid which may be useful for scientific 
study.
    (iv) Each agency acting under this limit on the take prohibitions of 
paragraph (a) of this section is to report to NMFS the numbers of fish 
handled and their status, on an annual basis. A designee of the listed 
entities is any individual the Federal or state fishery agency or other 
co-manager has authorized in writing to perform the listed functions.
    (4) The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to 
threatened species of salmonids listed in Sec. 223.102(a) do not apply 
to fishery harvest activities provided that:
    (i) Fisheries are managed in accordance with a NMFS-approved Fishery 
Management and Evaluation Plan (FMEP) and implemented in accordance with 
a letter of concurrence from NMFS. NMFS will approve an FMEP only if it 
clearly defines its intended scope and area of impact and sets forth the 
management objectives and performance indicators for the plan. The plan 
must adequately address the following criteria:
    (A) Define populations within affected listed ESUs, taking into 
account spatial and temporal distribution, genetic and phenotypic 
diversity, and other appropriate identifiably unique biological and life 
history traits. Populations may be aggregated for management purposes 
when dictated by information scarcity, if consistent with survival and 
recovery of the listed ESU. In identifying management units, the plan 
shall describe the reasons for using such units in lieu of population 
units, describe how the management units are defined, given biological 
and life history traits, so as to maximize consideration of the 
important biological diversity contained within the listed ESU, respond 
to the scale and complexity of the ESU, and help ensure consistent 
treatment of listed salmonids across a diverse geographic and 
jurisdictional range.
    (B) Utilize the concepts of ``viable'' and ``critical'' salmonid 
population thresholds, consistent with the concepts contained in the 
technical document entitled ``Viable Salmonid Populations (NMFS, 
2000b).'' The VSP paper provides a framework for identifying the 
biological requirements of listed salmonids, assessing the effects of 
management and conservation actions, and ensuring that such actions 
provide for the survival and recovery of listed species. Proposed 
management actions must recognize the significant differences in risk 
associated with viable and critical population threshold states and 
respond accordingly to minimize the long-term risks to population 
persistence. Harvest actions impacting populations that are functioning 
at or above the viable threshold must be designed to maintain the 
population or management unit at or above that level. For populations 
shown with a high degree of confidence to be above critical levels but 
not yet at viable levels, harvest management must not appreciably slow 
the population's achievement of viable function. Harvest actions 
impacting populations

[[Page 185]]

that are functioning at or below critical threshold must not be allowed 
to appreciably increase genetic and demographic risks facing the 
population and must be designed to permit the population's achievement 
of viable function, unless the plan demonstrates that the likelihood of 
survival and recovery of the entire ESU in the wild would not be 
appreciably reduced by greater risks to that individual population.
    (C) Set escapement objectives or maximum exploitation rates for each 
management unit or population based on its status and on a harvest 
program that assures that those rates or objectives are not exceeded. 
Maximum exploitation rates must not appreciably reduce the likelihood of 
survival and recovery of the ESU. Management of fisheries where 
artificially propagated fish predominate must not compromise the 
management objectives for commingled naturally spawned populations.
    (D) Display a biologically based rationale demonstrating that the 
harvest management strategy will not appreciably reduce the likelihood 
of survival and recovery of the ESU in the wild, over the entire period 
of time the proposed harvest management strategy affects the population, 
including effects reasonably certain to occur after the proposed actions 
cease.
    (E) Include effective monitoring and evaluation programs to assess 
compliance, effectiveness, and parameter validation. At a minimum, 
harvest monitoring programs must collect catch and effort data, 
information on escapements, and information on biological 
characteristics, such as age, fecundity, size and sex data, and 
migration timing.
    (F) Provide for evaluating monitoring data and making any revisions 
of assumptions, management strategies, or objectives that data show are 
needed.
    (G) Provide for effective enforcement and education. Coordination 
among involved jurisdictions is an important element in ensuring 
regulatory effectiveness and coverage.
    (H) Include restrictions on resident and anadromous species 
fisheries that minimize any take of listed species, including time, 
size, gear, and area restrictions.
    (I) Be consistent with plans and conditions established within any 
Federal court proceeding with continuing jurisdiction over tribal 
harvest allocations.
    (ii) The state monitors the amount of take of listed salmonids 
occurring in its fisheries and provides to NMFS on a regular basis, as 
defined in NMFS' letter of concurrence for the FMEP, a report 
summarizing this information, as well as the implementation and 
effectiveness of the FMEP. The state shall provide NMFS with access to 
all data and reports prepared concerning the implementation and 
effectiveness of the FMEP.
    (iii) The state confers with NMFS on its fishing regulation changes 
affecting listed ESUs to ensure consistency with the approved FMEP. 
Prior to approving a new or amended FMEP, NMFS will publish notification 
in the Federal Register announcing its availability for public review 
and comment. Such an announcement will provide for a comment period on 
the draft FMEP of not less than 30 days.
    (iv) NMFS provides written concurrence of the FMEP which specifies 
the implementation and reporting requirements. NMFS' approval of a plan 
shall be a written approval by NMFS Southwest or Northwest Regional 
Administrator, as appropriate. On a regular basis, NMFS will evaluate 
the effectiveness of the program in protecting and achieving a level of 
salmonid productivity commensurate with conservation of the listed 
salmonids. If it is not, NMFS will identify ways in which the program 
needs to be altered or strengthened. If the responsible agency does not 
make changes to respond adequately to the new information, NMFS will 
publish notification in the Federal Register announcing its intention to 
withdraw the limit for activities associated with that FMEP. Such an 
announcement will provide for a comment period of not less than 30 days, 
after which NMFS will make a final determination whether to withdraw the 
limit so that the prohibitions would then apply to those fishery harvest 
activities. A template for developing FMEPs is available from NMFS

Northwest Region's website (www.nwr.noaa.gov).
    (v) The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to 
threatened species of steelhead listed in Sec. 223.102 (a)(5) through 
(a)(9), (a)(14), and (a)(15) do not apply to fisheries managed solely by 
the states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and California until January 8, 
2001.
    (5) The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to 
threatened species of salmonids listed in Sec. 223.102(a) do not apply 
to activity associated with artificial propagation programs provided 
that:
    (i) A state or Federal Hatchery and Genetics Management Plan (HGMP) 
has been approved by NMFS as meeting the following criteria:
    (A) The HGMP has clearly stated goals, performance objectives, and 
performance indicators that indicate the purpose of the program, its 
intended results, and measurements of its performance in meeting those 
results. Goals shall address whether the program is intended to meet 
conservation objectives, contribute to the ultimate sustainability of 
natural spawning populations, and/or intended to augment tribal, 
recreational, or commercial fisheries. Objectives should enumerate the 
results desired from the program that will be used to measure the 
program's success or failure.
    (B) The HGMP utilizes the concepts of viable and critical salmonid 
population threshold, consistent with the concepts contained in the 
technical document entitled ``Viable Salmonid Populations'' (NMFS, 
2000b). Listed salmonids may be purposefully taken for broodstock 
purposes only if the donor population is currently at or above the 
viable threshold and the collection will not impair its function; if the 
donor population is not currently viable but the sole objective of the 
current collection program is to enhance the propagation or survival of 
the listed ESU; or if the donor population is shown with a high degree 
of confidence to be above critical threshold although not yet 
functioning at viable levels, and the collection will not appreciably 
slow the attainment of viable status for that population.
    (C) Taking into account health, abundances, and trends in the donor 
population, broodstock collection programs reflect appropriate 
priorities. The primary purpose of broodstock collection programs of 
listed species is to reestablish indigenous salmonid populations for 
conservation purposes. Such programs include restoration of similar, at-
risk populations within the same ESU, and reintroduction of at-risk 
populations to underseeded habitat. After the species' conservation 
needs are met and when consistent with survival and recovery of the ESU, 
broodstock collection programs may be authorized by NMFS such for 
secondary purposes, as to sustain tribal, recreational, and commercial 
fisheries.
    (D) The HGMP includes protocols to address fish health, broodstock 
collection, broodstock spawning, rearing and release of juveniles, 
deposition of hatchery adults, and catastrophic risk management.
    (E) The HGMP evaluates, minimizes, and accounts for the propagation 
program's genetic and ecological effects on natural populations, 
including disease transfer, competition, predation, and genetic 
introgression caused by the straying of hatchery fish.
    (F) The HGMP describes interrelationships and interdependencies with 
fisheries management. The combination of artificial propagation programs 
and harvest management must be designed to provide as many benefits and 
as few biological risks as possible for the listed species. For programs 
whose purpose is to sustain fisheries, HGMPs must not compromise the 
ability of FMEPs or other management plans to conserve listed salmonids.
    (G) Adequate artificial propagation facilities exist to properly 
rear progeny of naturally spawned broodstock, to maintain population 
health and diversity, and to avoid hatchery-influenced selection or 
domestication.
    (H) Adequate monitoring and evaluation exist to detect and evaluate 
the success of the hatchery program and any risks potentially impairing 
the recovery of the listed ESU.
    (I) The HGMP provides for evaluating monitoring data and making any 
revisions of assumptions, management

[[Page 187]]

strategies, or objectives that data show are needed;
    (J) NMFS provides written concurrence of the HGMP which specifies 
the implementation and reporting requirements. For Federally operated or 
funded hatcheries, the ESA section 7 consultation will achieve this 
purpose.
    (K) The HGMP is consistent with plans and conditions set within any 
Federal court proceeding with continuing jurisdiction over tribal 
harvest allocations.
    (ii) The state monitors the amount of take of listed salmonids 
occurring in its hatchery program and provides to NMFS on a regular 
basis a report summarizing this information, and the implementation and 
effectiveness of the HGMP as defined in NMFS' letter of concurrence. The 
state shall provide NMFS with access to all data and reports prepared 
concerning the implementation and effectiveness of the HGMP.
    (iii) The state confers with NMFS on a regular basis regarding 
intended collections of listed broodstock to ensure congruity with the 
approved HGMP.
    (iv) Prior to final approval of an HGMP, NMFS will publish 
notification in the Federal Register announcing its availability for 
public review and comment for a period of at least 30 days.
    (v) NMFS' approval of a plan shall be a written approval by NMFS 
Southwest or Northwest Regional Administrator, as appropriate.
    (vi) On a regular basis, NMFS will evaluate the effectiveness of the 
HGMP in protecting and achieving a level of salmonid productivity 
commensurate with the conservation of the listed salmonids. If the HGMP 
is not effective, the NMFS will identify to the jurisdiction ways in 
which the program needs to be altered or strengthened. If the 
responsible agency does not make changes to respond adequately to the 
new information, NMFS will publish notification in the Federal Register 
announcing its intention to withdraw the limit on activities associated 
with that program. Such an announcement will provide for a comment 
period of no less than 30 days, after which NMFS will make a final 
determination whether to withdraw the limit so that take prohibitions, 
likeall other activity not within a limit, would then apply to that 
program. A template for developing HGMPs is available from NMFS 
Northwest Region's website (www.nwr.noaa.gov).
    (6) The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to 
threatened species of salmonids listed in Sec. 223.102(a) do not apply 
to actions undertaken in compliance with a resource management plan 
developed jointly by the States of Washington, Oregon and/or Idaho and 
the Tribes (joint plan) within the continuing jurisdiction of United 
States v. Washington or United States v. Oregon, the on-going Federal 
court proceedings to enforce and implement reserved treaty fishing 
rights, provided that:
    (i) The Secretary has determined pursuant to 50 CFR 223.209 and the 
government-to-government processes therein that implementing and 
enforcing the joint tribal/state plan will not appreciably reduce the 
likelihood of survival and recovery of affected threatened ESUs.
    (ii) The joint plan will be implemented and enforced within the 
parameters set forth in United States v. Washington or United States v. 
Oregon.
    (iii) In making that determination for a joint plan, the Secretary 
has taken comment on how any fishery management plan addresses the 
criteria in Sec. 223.203(b)(4), or on how any hatchery and genetic 
management plan addresses the criteria in Sec. 223.203(b)(5).
    (iv) The Secretary shall publish notice in the Federal Register of 
any determination whether or not a joint plan, will appreciably reduce 
the likelihood of survival and recovery of affected threatened ESUs, 
together with a discussion of the biological analysis underlying that 
determination.
    (v) On a regular basis, NMFS will evaluate the effectiveness of the 
joint plan in protecting and achieving a level of salmonid productivity 
commensurate with conservation of the listed salmonids. If the plan is 
not effective, then NMFS will identify to the jurisdiction ways in which 
the joint plan needs to be altered or strengthened. If the responsible 
agency does not make changes to respond adequately to

[[Page 188]]

the new information, NMFS will publish notification in the Federal 
Register announcing its intention to withdraw the limit on activities 
associated with that joint plan. Such an announcement will provide for a 
comment period of no less than 30 days, after which NMFS will make a 
final determination whether to withdraw the limit so that take 
prohibitions would then apply to that joint plan as to all other 
activity not within a limit.
    (7) The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to 
threatened species of salmonids listed in Sec. 223.102(a) do not apply 
to scientific research activities provided that:
    (i) Scientific research activities involving purposeful take is 
conducted by employees or contractors of the ODFW, WDFW (Agencies), 
IDFG, or CDFG (Agencies), or as a part of a monitoring and research 
program overseen by or coordinated with that Agency.
    (ii) The Agencies provide for NMFS' review and approval a list of 
all scientific research activities involving direct take planned for the 
coming year, including an estimate of the total direct take that is 
anticipated, a description of the study design, including a 
justification for taking the species and a description of the techniques 
to be used, and a point of contact.
    (iii) The Agencies annually provide to NMFS the results of 
scientific research activities directed at threatened salmonids, 
including a report of the direct take resulting from the studies and a 
summary of the results of such studies.
    (iv) Scientific research activities that may incidentally take 
threatened salmonids are either conducted by agency personnel, or are in 
accord with a permit issued by the Agency.
    (v) The Agencies provide NMFS annually, for its review and approval, 
a report listing all scientific research activities it conducts or 
permits that may incidentally take threatened salmonids during the 
coming year. Such reports shall also contain the amount of incidental 
take of threatened salmonids occurring in the previous year's scientific 
research activities and a summary of the results of such research.
    (vi) Electrofishing in any body of water known or suspected to 
contain threatened salmonids is conducted in accordance with NMFS 
``Guidelines for Electrofishing Waters Containing Salmonids Listed Under 
the Endangered Species Act'' (NMFS, 2000a).
    (vii) NMFS' approval of a research program shall be a written 
approval by NMFS Northwest or Southwest Regional Administrator.
    (8) The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to 
threatened species of salmonids listed in Sec. 223.102(a) do not apply 
to habitat restoration activities, as defined in paragraph (b)(8)(iv) of 
this section, provided that the activity is part of a watershed 
conservation plan, and:
    (i) The watershed conservation plan has been certified by the State 
of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, or California (State) to be consistent 
with the state's watershed conservation plan guidelines.
    (ii) The State's watershed conservation plan guidelines have been 
found by NMFS to provide for plans that:
    (A) Take into account the potential severity of direct, indirect, 
and cumulative impacts of proposed activities in light of the status of 
affected species and populations.
    (B) Will not reduce the likelihood of either survival or recovery of 
listed species in the wild.
    (C) Ensure that any taking will be incidental.
    (D) Minimize and mitigate any adverse impacts.
    (E) Provide for effective monitoring and adaptive management.
    (F) Use the best available science and technology, including 
watershed analysis.
    (G) Provide for public and scientific review and input.
    (H) Include any measures that NMFS determines are necessary or 
appropriate.
    (I) Include provisions that clearly identify those activities that 
are part of plan implementation.
    (J) Control risk to listed species by ensuring funding and 
implementation of the above plan components.
    (iii) NMFS will periodically review state certifications of 
Watershed Conservation Plans to ensure adherence to

[[Page 189]]

approved watershed conservation plan guidelines.
    (iv) ``Habitat restoration activity'' is defined as an activity 
whose primary purpose is to restore natural aquatic or riparian habitat 
conditions or processes. ``Primary purpose'' means the activity would 
not be undertaken but for its restoration purpose.
    (v) Prior to approving watershed conservation plan guidelines under 
paragraph (b)(8)(ii) of this section, NMFS will publish notification in 
the Federal Register announcing the availability of the proposed 
guidelines for public review and comment. Such an announcement will 
provide for a comment period on the draft guidelines of no less than 30 
days.
    (9) The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to 
threatened species of salmonids listed in Sec. 223.102(a) do not apply 
to the physical diversion of water from a stream or lake, provided that:
    (i) NMFS' engineering staff or any resource agency or tribe NMFS 
designates (authorized officer) has agreed in writing that the diversion 
facility is screened, maintained, and operated in compliance with 
Juvenile Fish Screen Criteria, National Marine Fisheries Service, 
Northwest Region, Revised February 16, 1995, with Addendum of May 9, 
1996, or in California with NMFS' Southwest Region ``Fish Screening 
Criteria for Anadromous Salmonids, January 1997'' or with any subsequent 
revision.
    (ii) The owner or manager of the diversion allows any NMFS engineer 
or authorized officer access to the diversion facility for purposes of 
inspection and determination of continued compliance with the criteria.
    (iii) On a case by case basis, NMFS or an Authorized Officer will 
review and approve a juvenile fish screen design and construction plan 
and schedule that the water diverter proposes for screen installation. 
The plan and schedule will describe interim operation measures to avoid 
take of threatened salmonids. NMFS may require a commitment of 
compensatory mitigation if implementation of the plan and schedule is 
terminated prior to completion. If the plan and schedule are not met, or 
if a schedule modification is made that is not approved by NMFS or 
Authorized Officer, or if the screen installation deviates from the 
approved design, the water diversion will be subject to take 
prohibitions and mitigation.
    (iv) This limit on the prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section 
does not encompass any impacts of reduced flows resulting from the 
diversion or impacts caused during installation of the diversion device. 
These impacts are subject to the prohibition on take of listed 
salmonids.
    (10) The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to 
threatened species of salmonids listed in Sec. 223.102(a) do not apply 
to routine road maintenance activities provided that:
    (i) The activity results from routine road maintenance activity 
conducted by ODOT employees or agents that complies with ODOT's 
Transportation Maintenance Management System Water Quality and Habitat 
Guide (July, 1999); or by employees or agents of a state, county, city 
or port that complies with a program substantially similar to that 
contained in the ODOT Guide that is determined to meet or exceed the 
protections provided by the ODOT Guide; or by employees or agents of a 
state, county, city or port that complies with a routine road 
maintenance program that meets proper functioning habitat conditions as 
described further in subparagraph (ii) following. NMFS' approval of 
state, city, county, or port programs that are equivalent to the ODOT 
program, or of any amendments, shall be a written approval by NMFS 
Northwest or Southwest Regional Administrator, whichever is appropriate. 
Any jurisdiction desiring its routine road maintenance activities to be 
within this limit must first commit in writing to apply management 
practices that result in protections equivalent to or better than those 
provided by the ODOT Guide, detailing how it will assure adequate 
training, tracking, and reporting, and describing in detail any dust 
abatement practices it requests to be covered.
    (ii) NMFS finds the routine road maintenance activities of any 
state, city, county, or port to be consistent with the conservation of 
listed

[[Page 190]]

salmonids' habitat when it contributes, as does the ODOT Guide, to the 
attainment and maintenance of properly functioning condition (PFC). NMFS 
defines PFC as the sustained presence of natural habitat-forming 
processes that are necessary for the long-term survival of salmonids 
through the full range of environmental variation. Actions that affect 
salmonid habitat must not impair properly functioning habitat, 
appreciably reduce the functioning of already impaired habitat, or 
retard the long-term progress of impaired habitat toward PFC. 
Periodically, NMFS will evaluate an approved program for its 
effectiveness in maintaining and achieving habitat function that 
provides for conservation of the listed salmonids. Whenever warranted, 
NMFS will identify to the jurisdiction ways in which the program needs 
to be altered or strengthened. Changes may be identified if the program 
is not protecting desired habitat functions, or where even with the 
habitat characteristics and functions originally targeted, habitat is 
not supporting population productivity levels needed to conserve the 
ESU. If any jurisdiction within the limit does not make changes to 
respond adequately to the new information in the shortest amount of time 
feasible, but not longer than one year, NMFS will publish notification 
in the Federal Register announcing its intention to withdraw the limit 
so that take prohibitions would then apply to the program as to all 
other activity not within a limit. Such an announcement will provide for 
a comment period of no less than 30 days, after which NMFS will make a 
final determination whether to subject the activities to the ESA section 
9(a)(1) prohibitions.
    (iii) Prior to implementing any changes to a program within this 
limit the jurisdiction provides NMFS a copy of the proposed change for 
review and approval as within this limit.
    (iv) Prior to approving any state, city, county, or port program as 
within this limit, or approving any substantive change in a program 
within this limit, NMFS will publish notification in the Federal 
Register announcing the availability of the program or the draft changes 
for public review and comment. Such an announcement will provide for a 
comment period of not less than 30 days.
    (v) Pesticide and herbicide spraying is not included within this 
limit, even if in accord with the ODOT guidance.
    (11) The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to 
threatened species of salmonids listed in Sec. 223.102(a) do not apply 
to activities within the City of Portland, Oregon Parks and Recreation 
Department's (PP&R) Pest Management Program (March 1997), including its 
Waterways Pest Management Policy updated December 1, 1999, provided 
that:
    (i) Use of only the following chemicals is included within this 
limit on the take prohibitions: Round Up, Rodeo, Garlon 3A, Surfactant 
LI-700, Napropamide, Cutrine Plus, and Aquashade.
    (ii) Any chemical use is initiated in accord with the priorities and 
decision processes of the Department's Pest Management Policy, including 
the Waterways Pest Management Policy, updated December 1, 1999.
    (iii) Any chemical use within a 25 ft. (7.5 m) buffer complies with 
the buffer application constraints contained in PP&R's Waterways Pest 
Management Policy (update December 1, 1999).
    (iv) Prior to implementing any changes to this limit, the PP&R 
provides NMFS with a copy of the proposed change for review and approval 
as within this limit.
    (v) Prior to approving any substantive change in a program within 
this limit, NMFS will publish notification in the Federal Register 
announcing the availability of the program or the draft changes for 
public review and comment. Such an announcement will provide for a 
comment period of no less than 30 days.
    (vi) NMFS' approval of amendments shall be a written approval by 
NMFS Northwest Regional Administrator.
    (vii) NMFS finds the PP&R Pest Management Program activities to be 
consistent with the conservation of listed salmonids' habitat by 
contributing to the attainment and maintenance of properly functioning 
condition (PFC). NMFS defines PFC as the sustained presence of a 
watershed's natural habitat-forming processes that

[[Page 191]]

are necessary for the long-term survival of salmonids through the full 
range of environmental variation. Actions that affect salmonid habitat 
must not impair properly functioning habitat, appreciably reduce the 
functioning of already impaired habitat, or retard the long-term 
progress of impaired habitat toward PFC. Periodically, NMFS will 
evaluate the effectiveness of an approved program in maintaining and 
achieving habitat function that provides for conservation of the listed 
salmonids. Whenever warranted, NMFS will identify to the jurisdiction 
ways in which the program needs to be altered or strengthened. Changes 
may be identified if the program is not protecting desired habitat 
functions, or where even with the habitat characteristics and functions 
originally targeted, habitat is not supporting population productivity 
levels needed to conserve the ESU. If any jurisdiction within the limit 
does not make changes to respond adequately to the new information in 
the shortest amount of time feasible, but not longer than 1 year, NMFS 
will publish notification in the Federal Register announcing its 
intention to withdraw the limit so that take prohibitions would then 
apply to the program as to all other activity not within a limit. Such 
an announcement will provide for a comment period of no less than 30 
days, after which NMFS will make a final determination whether to 
subject the activities to the ESA section 9(a)(1) prohibitions.
    (12) The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to 
threatened species of salmonids listed in Sec. 223.102(a) do not apply 
to municipal, residential, commercial, and industrial (MRCI) development 
(including redevelopment) activities provided that:
    (i) Such development occurs pursuant to city, county, or regional 
government ordinances or plans that NMFS has determined are adequately 
protective of listed species; or within the jurisdiction of the Metro 
regional government in Oregon and pursuant to ordinances that Metro has 
found comply with its Urban Growth Management Functional Plan 
(Functional Plan) following a determination by NMFS that the Functional 
Plan is adequately protective. NMFS approval or determinations about any 
MRCI development ordinances or plans, including the Functional Plan, 
shall be a written approval by NMFS Northwest or Southwest Regional 
Administrator, whichever is appropriate. NMFS will apply the following 
12 evaluation considerations when reviewing MRCI development ordinances 
or plans to assess whether they adequately conserve listed salmonids by 
maintaining and restoring properly functioning habitat conditions:
    (A) MRCI development ordinance or plan ensures that development will 
avoid inappropriate areas such as unstable slopes, wetlands, areas of 
high habitat value, and similarly constrained sites.
    (B) MRCI development ordinance or plan adequately avoids stormwater 
discharge impacts to water quality and quantity or to the hydrograph of 
the watershed, including peak and base flows of perennial streams.
    (C) MRCI development ordinance or plan provides adequately 
protective riparian area management requirements to attain or maintain 
PFC around all rivers, estuaries, streams, lakes, deepwater habitats, 
and intermittent streams. Compensatory mitigation is provided, where 
necessary, to offset unavoidable damage to PFC due to MRCI development 
impacts to riparian management areas.
    (D) MRCI development ordinance or plan avoids stream crossings by 
roads, utilities, and other linear development wherever possible, and, 
where crossings must be provided, minimize impacts through choice of 
mode, sizing, and placement.
    (E) MRCI development ordinance or plan adequately protects 
historical stream meander patterns and channel migration zones and 
avoids hardening of stream banks and shorelines.
    (F) MRCI development ordinance or plan adequately protects wetlands 
and wetland functions, including isolated wetlands.
    (G) MRCI development ordinance or plan adequately preserves the 
hydrologic capacity of permanent and intermittent streams to pass peak 
flows.
    (H) MRCI development ordinance or plan includes adequate provisions 
for

[[Page 192]]

landscaping with native vegetation to reduce need for watering and 
application of herbicides, pesticides, and fertilizer.
    (I) MRCI development ordinance or plan includes adequate provisions 
to prevent erosion and sediment run-off during construction.
    (J) MRCI development ordinance or plan ensures that water supply 
demands can be met without impacting flows needed for threatened 
salmonids either directly or through groundwater withdrawals and that 
any new water diversions are positioned and screened in a way that 
prevents injury or death of salmonids.
    (K) MRCI development ordinance or plan provides necessary 
enforcement, funding, reporting, and implementation mechanisms and 
formal plan evaluations at intervals that do not exceed 5 years.
    (L) MRCI development ordinance and plan complies with all other 
state and Federal environmental and natural resource laws and permits.
    (ii) The city, county or regional government provides NMFS with 
annual reports regarding implementation and effectiveness of the 
ordinances, including: any water quality monitoring information the 
jurisdiction has available; aerial photography (or some other graphic 
display) of each MRCI development or MRCI expansion area at sufficient 
detail to demonstrate the width and vegetation condition of riparian 
set-backs; information to demonstrate the success of stormwater 
management and other conservation measures; and a summary of any flood 
damage, maintenance problems, or other issues.
    (iii) NMFS finds the MRCI development activity to be consistent with 
the conservation of listed salmonids' habitat when it contributes to the 
attainment and maintenance of PFC. NMFS defines PFC as the sustained 
presence of a watershed's habitat-forming processes that are necessary 
for the long-term survival of salmonids through the full range of 
environmental variation. Actions that affect salmonid habitat must not 
impair properly functioning habitat, appreciably reduce the functioning 
of already impaired habitat, or retard the long-term progress of 
impaired habitat toward PFC. Periodically, NMFS will evaluate an 
approved program for its effectiveness in maintaining and achieving 
habitat function that provides for conservation of the listed salmonids. 
Whenever warranted, NMFS will identify to the jurisdiction ways in which 
the program needs to be altered or strengthened. Changes may be 
identified if the program is not protecting desired habitat functions, 
or where even with the habitat characteristics and functions originally 
targeted, habitat is not supporting population productivity levels 
needed to conserve the ESU. If any jurisdiction within the limit does 
not make changes to respond adequately to the new information in the 
shortest amount of time feasible, but not longer than 1 year, NMFS will 
publish notification in the Federal Register announcing its intention to 
withdraw the limit so that take prohibitions would then apply to the 
program as to all other activity not within a limit. Such an 
announcement will provide for a comment period of no less than 30 days, 
after which NMFS will make a final determination whether to subject the 
activities to the ESA section 9(a)(1) prohibitions.
    (iv) Prior to approving any city, county, or regional government 
ordinances or plans as within this limit, or approving any substantive 
change in an ordinance or plan within this limit, NMFS will publish 
notification in the Federal Register announcing the availability of the 
ordinance or plan or the draft changes for public review and comment. 
Such an announcement will provide for a comment period of no less than 
30 days.
    (13) The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to 
threatened species of salmonids listed in Sec. 223.102(a) do not apply 
to non-Federal forest management activities conducted in the State of 
Washington provided that:
    (i) The action is in compliance with forest practice regulations 
adopted and implemented by the Washington Forest Practices Board that 
NMFS has found are at least as protective of habitat functions as are 
the regulatory elements of the Forests and Fish Report dated April 29, 
1999, and submitted to

[[Page 193]]

the Forest Practices Board by a consortium of landowners, tribes, and 
state and Federal agencies.
    (ii) All non-regulatory elements of the Forests and Fish Report are 
being implemented.
    (iii) Actions involving use of herbicides, pesticides, or fungicides 
are not included within this limit.
    (iv) Actions taken under alternative plans are included in this 
limit provided that the Washington Department of Natural Resources 
(WDNR) finds that the alternate plans protect physical and biological 
processes at least as well as the state forest practices rules and 
provided that NMFS, or any resource agency or tribe NMFS designates, has 
the opportunity to review the plan at every stage of the development and 
implementation. A plan may be excluded from this limit if, after such 
review, WDNR determines that the plan is not likely to adequately 
protect listed salmon.
    (v) Prior to determining that regulations adopted by the Forest 
Practice Board are at least as protective as the elements of the Forests 
and Fish Report, NMFS will publish notification in the Federal Register 
announcing the availability of the Report and regulations for public 
review and comment.
    (vi) NMFS finds the activities to be consistent with the 
conservation of listed salmonids' habitat by contributing to the 
attainment and maintenance of PFC. NMFS defines PFC as the sustained 
presence of a watershed's natural habitat-forming processes that are 
necessary for the long-term survival of salmonids through the full range 
of environmental variation. Actions that affect salmonid habitat must 
not impair properly functioning habitat, appreciably reduce the 
functioning of already impaired habitat, or retard the long-term 
progress of impaired habitat toward PFC. Programs must meet this 
biological standard in order for NMFS to find they qualify for a 
habitat-related limit. NMFS uses the best available science to make 
these determinations. NMFS may review and revise previous findings as 
new scientific information becomes available. NMFS will evaluate the 
effectiveness of the program in maintaining and achieving habitat 
function that provides for conservation of the listed salmonids. If the 
program is not adequate, NMFS will identify to the jurisdiction ways in 
which the program needs to be altered or strengthened. Changes may be 
identified if the program is not protecting desired habitat functions or 
where even with the habitat characteristics and functions originally 
targeted, habitat is not supporting population productivity levels 
needed to conserve the ESU. If Washington does not make changes to 
respond adequately to the new information, NMFS will publish 
notification in the Federal Register announcing its intention to 
withdraw the limit on activities associated with the program. Such an 
announcement will provide for a comment period of no less than 30 days, 
after which NMFS will make a final determination whether to subject the 
activities to the ESA section 9(a)(1) take prohibitions.
    (vii) NMFS approval of regulations shall be a written approval by 
NMFS Northwest Regional Administrator.
    (c) Affirmative Defense. In connection with any action alleging a 
violation of the prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section with 
respect to the threatened species of salmonids listed in Sec. 
223.102(a), any person claiming the benefit of any limit listed in 
paragraph (b) of this section or Sec. 223.204(a) shall have a defense 
where the person can demonstrate that the limit is applicable and was in 
force, and that the person fully complied with the limit at the time of 
the alleged violation. This defense is an affirmative defense that must 
be raised, pleaded, and proven by the proponent. If proven, this defense 
will be an absolute defense to liability under section 9(a)(1)(G) of the 
ESA with respect to the alleged violation.
    (d) Severability. The provisions of this section and the various 
applications thereof are distinct and severable from one another. If any 
provision or the application thereof to any person or circumstances is 
stayed or determined to be invalid, such stay or invalidity shall not 
affect other provisions, or the application of such provisions to other 
persons or circumstances, which can be given effect without the stayed 
or invalid provision or application.

Sec. 223.203  Anadromous fish.

                                * * * * *

    (a) Prohibitions. The prohibitions of section 9(a)(1) of the ESA (16 
U.S.C. 1538(a)(1)) relating to endangered species apply to fish with an 
intact adipose fin that are part of the threatened species of salmonids 
listed in Sec. 223.102(c)(3) through (c)(24).
    (b) Limits on the prohibitions. The limits to the prohibitions of 
paragraph (a) of this section relating to threatened species of 
salmonids listed in Sec. 223.102(c)(3) through (c)(24) are described in 
the following paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(13):

                                * * * * *

    (2) The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to 
threatened Puget Sound steelhead listed in Sec. 223.102(c)(23) do not 
apply to:
    (i) Activities specified in an application for a permit for 
scientific purposes or to enhance the conservation or survival of the 
species, provided that the application has been received by the 
Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA), no later than November 
14, 2008. The prohibitions of this section apply to these activities 
upon the AA's rejection of the application as insufficient, upon 
issuance or denial of a permit, or June 1, 2009, whichever occurs 
earliest, or
    (ii) Steelhead harvested in tribal or recreational fisheries prior 
to June 1, 2009, so long as the harvest is authorized by the State of 
Washington or a tribe with jurisdiction over steelhead harvest. If NMFS 
does not receive a fishery management plan for Puget Sound steelhead by 
November 14, 2008, subsequent take by harvest will be subject to the 
take prohibitions.

<R05>
Sec. 223.204  Tribal plans.

    (a) Limits on the prohibitions. The prohibitions of Sec. 223.203(a) 
of this subpart relating to threatened species of salmonids listed in 
Sec. 223.102 do not apply to any activity undertaken by a tribe, tribal 
member, tribal permittee, tribal employee, or tribal agent in compliance 
with a Tribal resource management plan (Tribal Plan), provided that the 
Secretary determines that implementation of such Tribal Plan will not 
appreciably reduce the likelihood of survival and recovery of the listed 
salmonids. In making that determination the Secretary shall use the best 
available biological data (including any tribal data and analysis) to 
determine the Tribal Plan's impact on the biological requirements of the 
species, and will assess the effect of the Tribal Plan on survival and 
recovery, consistent with legally enforceable tribal rights and with the 
Secretary's trust responsibilities to tribes.
    (b) Consideration of a Tribal Plan. (1) A Tribal Plan may include 
but is not limited to plans that address fishery harvest, artificial 
production, research, or water or land management, and may be developed 
by one tribe or jointly with other tribes. The Secretary will consult on 
a government-to-government basis with any tribe that so requests and 
will provide to the maximum extent practicable technical assistance in 
examining impacts on listed salmonids and other salmonids as tribes 
develop Tribal resource management plans that meet the management 
responsibilities and needs of the tribes. A Tribal Plan must specify the 
procedures by which the tribe will enforce its provisions.
    (2) Where there exists a Federal court proceeding with continuing 
jurisdiction over the subject matter of a Tribal

[[Page 195]]

Plan, the plan may be developed and implemented within the ongoing 
Federal Court proceeding. In such circumstances, compliance with the 
Tribal Plan's terms shall be determined within that Federal Court 
proceeding.
    (3) The Secretary shall seek comment from the public on the 
Secretary's pending determination whether or not implementation of a 
Tribal Plan will appreciably reduce the likelihood of survival and 
recovery of the listed salmonids.
    (4) The Secretary shall publish notification in the Federal Register 
of any determination regarding a Tribal Plan and the basis for that 
determination.

<R05>
Sec. 223.206  Exceptions to prohibitions relating to sea turtles.

    (a) Permits--(1) Scientific research, education, zoological 
exhibition, or species enhancement permits. The Assistant Administrator 
may issue permits authorizing activities which would otherwise be 
prohibited under Sec. 223.205(a) for scientific or educational 
purposes, for zoological exhibition, or to enhance the propagation or 
survival of threatened species of sea turtles, in accordance with and 
subject to the conditions of part 222, subpart C--General Permit 
Procedures.
    (2) Incidental-take permits. The Assistant Administrator may issue 
permits authorizing activities that would otherwise be prohibited under 
Sec. 223.205(a) in accordance with section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Act (16 
U.S.C. 1539(a)(1)(B)), and in accordance with, and subject to, the 
implementing regulations in part 222 of this chapter. Such permits may 
be issued for the incidental taking of threatened and endangered species 
of sea turtles.
    (b) Exception for injured, dead, or stranded specimens. If any 
member of any threatened species of sea turtle is found injured, dead, 
or stranded, any agent or employee of the National Marine Fisheries 
Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Coast Guard, or any 
other Federal land or water management agency, or any agent or employee 
of a state agency responsible for fish and wildlife who is designated by 
his or her agency for such purposes, may, when acting in the course of 
his or her official duties, take such specimens without a permit if such 
taking is necessary to aid a sick, injured, or stranded specimen or 
dispose of a dead specimen or salvage a dead specimen which may be 
useful for scientific study. Whenever possible, live specimens shall be 
returned to their aquatic environment as soon as possible. Every action 
shall be reported in writing to the Assistant Administrator within 30 
days, and reports of further occurrence shall be made as deemed 
appropriate by the Assistant Administrator until the specimen is either 
returned to its environment or disposed of. Reports shall be mailed by 
registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the Assistant 
Administrator and shall contain the following information:
    (1) Name and position of the official or employee involved;
    (2) Description of the specimen(s) involved;
    (3) Date and location of disposal;
    (4) Circumstances requiring the action;
    (5) Method of disposal;
    (6) Disposition of the specimen(s), including, where the specimen(s) 
has been retained in captivity, a description of the place and means of 
confinement, and the measures taken for its maintenance and care; and
    (7) Such other information as the Assistant Administrator may 
require.
    (c) Exception for research or conservation. Any employee or agent of 
the National Marine Fisheries Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service, or 
a state fish and wildlife agency operating a conservation program 
pursuant to the terms of a Cooperative Agreement with the National 
Marine Fisheries Service or the Fish and Wildlife Service in accordance 
with section 6(c) of the Act, designated by his or her agency for such 
purposes, may, when acting in the course of his or her official duties, 
take any threatened species to carry out scientific research or 
conservation programs. All such takings shall be reported within 30 days 
of the taking to the Assistant Administrator who may request additional 
reports of the taking and research at the Assistant Administrator's 
discretion.
    (d) Exception for incidental taking. The prohibitions against taking 
in Sec. 223.205(a) do not apply to the incidental take of any member of 
a threatened species of sea turtle (i.e., a take not directed towards 
such member)

[[Page 197]]

during fishing or scientific research activities, to the extent that 
those involved are in compliance with all applicable requirements of 
paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(11) of this section, or in compliance with 
the terms and conditions of an incidental take permit issued pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (1) Handling and resuscitation requirements. (i) Any specimen taken 
incidentally during the course of fishing or scientific research 
activities must be handled with due care to prevent injury to live 
specimens, observed for activity, and returned to the water according to 
the following procedures:
    (A) Sea turtles that are actively moving or determined to be dead as 
described in paragraph (d)(1)(i)(C) of this section must be released 
over the stern of the boat. In addition, they must be released only when 
fishing or scientific collection gear is not in use, when the engine 
gears are in neutral position, and in areas where they are unlikely to 
be recaptured or injured by vessels.
    (B) Resuscitation must be attempted on sea turtles that are 
comatose, or inactive, as determined in paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section, by:
    (1) Placing the turtle on its bottom shell (plastron) so that the 
turtle is right side up and elevating its hindquarters at least 6 inches 
(15.2 cm) for a period of 4 up to 24 hours. The amount of the elevation 
depends on the size of the turtle; greater elevations are needed for 
larger turtles. Periodically, rock the turtle gently left to right and 
right to left by holding the outer edge of the shell (carapace) and 
lifting one side about 3 inches (7.6 cm) then alternate to the other 
side. Gently touch the eye and pinch the tail (reflex test) periodically 
to see if there is a response.
    (2) Sea turtles being resuscitated must be shaded and kept damp or 
moist but under no circumstance be placed into a container holding 
water. A water-soaked towel placed over the head, carapace, and flippers 
is the most effective method in keeping a turtle moist.
    (3) Sea turtles that revive and become active must be released over 
the stern of the boat only when fishing or scientific collection gear is 
not in use, when the engine gears are in neutral position, and in areas 
where they are unlikely to be recaptured or injured by vessels. Sea 
turtles that fail to respond to the reflex test or fail to move within 4 
hours (up to 24, if possible) must be returned to the water in the same 
manner as that for actively moving turtles.
    (C) A turtle is determined to be dead if the muscles are stiff 
(rigor mortis) and/or the flesh has begun to rot; otherwise the turtle 
is determined to be comatose or inactive and resuscitation attempts are 
necessary.
    (ii) In addition to the provisions of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this 
section, a person aboard a vessel in the Atlantic, including the 
Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, that has pelagic or bottom 
longline gear on board and that has been issued, or is required to have, 
a limited access permit for highly migratory species under Sec. 635.4 
of this title, must comply with the handling and release requirements 
specified in Sec. 635.21 of this title.
    (iii) Any specimen taken incidentally during the course of fishing 
or scientific research activities must not be consumed, sold, landed, 
offloaded, transshipped, or kept below deck.
    (2) Gear requirements for trawlers--(i) TED requirement for shrimp 
trawlers. Any shrimp trawler that is in the Atlantic Area or Gulf Area 
must have an approved TED installed in each net that is rigged for 
fishing. A net is rigged for fishing if it is in the water, or if it is 
shackled, tied, or otherwise connected to any trawl door or board, or to 
any tow rope, cable, pole or extension, either on board or attached in 
any manner to the shrimp trawler. Exceptions to the TED requirement for 
shrimp trawlers are provided in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section.
    (ii) Exemptions from the TED requirement--(A) Alternative tow-time 
restrictions. A shrimp trawler is exempt from the TED requirements of 
paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section if it complies with the alternative 
tow-time restrictions in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section and if it:
    (1) Has on board no power or mechanical-advantage trawl retrieval 
system (i.e., any device used to haul any part of the net aboard);

[[Page 198]]

    (2) Is a bait shrimper that retains all live shrimp on board with a 
circulating seawater system, if it does not possess more than 32 lb. 
(14.5 kg) of dead shrimp on board, if it has a valid original state 
bait-shrimp license, and if the state license allows the licensed vessel 
to participate in the bait shrimp fishery exclusively;
    (3) Has only a pusher-head trawl, skimmer trawl, or wing net rigged 
for fishing;
    (4) Is in an area during a period for which tow-time restrictions 
apply under paragraphs (d)(3)(ii) or (iii) of this section, if it 
complies with all applicable provisions imposed under those paragraphs; 
or
    (5) Is using a single test net (try net) with a headrope length of 
12 ft (3.6 m) or less and with a footrope length of 15 ft (4.6 m) or 
less, if it is pulled immediately in front of another net or is not 
connected to another net in any way, if no more than one test net is 
used at a time, and if it is not towed as a primary net, in which case 
the exemption under this paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) applies to the test 
net.
    (B) Exempted gear or activities. The following fishing gear or 
activities are exempted from the TED requirements of paragraph (d)(2)(i) 
of this section:
    (1) A beam or roller trawl, if the frame is outfitted with rigid 
vertical bars, and if none of the spaces between the bars, or between 
the bars and the frame, exceeds 4 inches (10.2 cm); and
    (2) A shrimp trawler fishing for, or possessing, royal red shrimp, 
if royal red shrimp constitutes at least 90 percent (by weight) of all 
shrimp either found on board, or offloaded from that shrimp trawler.
    (iii) Gear requirement--summer flounder trawlers--(A) TED 
requirement. (1) Any summer flounder trawler in the summer flounder 
fishery-sea turtle protection area must have an approved TED installed 
in each net that is rigged for fishing. A net is rigged for fishing if 
it is in the water, or if it is shackled, tied, or otherwise connected 
to any trawl door or board, or to any tow rope, cable, pole or 
extension, either on board or attached in any manner to the summer 
flounder trawler. Exceptions to the TED requirement for summer flounder 
trawlers are provided in paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B) of this section.
    (2) Any approved hard TED or special hard TED installed in a summer 
flounder trawl must be installed in a TED extension. The TED extension 
is a cylindrical piece of webbing distinct from the main trawl's body, 
wings, codend, and any other net extension(s). The TED extension must be 
constructed of webbing no larger than 3.5 inch (8.9 cm) stretched mesh. 
The TED extension must extend at least 24 inches (61.0 cm) but not more 
than 36 inches (91.4 cm) forward of the leading edge of the TED and aft 
of the trailing edge of the grid.
    (B) Exemptions from the TED requirement. Any summer flounder trawler 
north of 35[deg]46.1[min] N. lat. (Oregon Inlet, NC) from January 15 
through March 15 annually is exempt from the TED requirement of 
paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, unless the Assistant 
Administrator determines that TED use is necessary to protect sea 
turtles or ensure compliance, pursuant to the procedures of paragraph 
(d)(4) of this section.
    (C) Monitoring. Summer flounder trawlers must carry onboard a NMFS-
approved observer if requested by the Southeast Regional Administrator 
or the Northeast Regional Administrator. A written notification will be 
sent to the address specified for the vessel in either the NMFS or state 
fishing permit application, or to the address specified for registration 
or documentation purposes, or upon written notification otherwise served 
on the owner or operator of the vessel. Owners and operators must comply 
with the terms and conditions specified in such written notification. 
All NMFS-approved observers will report any violations of this section, 
or other applicable regulations and laws. Information collected by 
observers may be used for enforcement purposes.
    (D) Additional sea turtle conservation measures. The Assistant 
Administrator may impose other such restrictions upon summer flounder 
trawlers as the Assistant Administrator deems necessary or appropriate 
to protect sea turtles and ensure compliance, pursuant to the procedures 
of paragraph (d)(4) of this section. Such measures may include, but are 
not limited to, a

[[Page 199]]

requirement to use TEDs in areas other than summer flounder fishery-sea 
turtle protection area, a requirement to use limited tow-times, and 
closure of the fishery.
    (3) Tow-time restrictions--(i) Duration of tows. If tow-time 
restrictions are utilized pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(ii), (d)(3)(ii), 
or (d)(3)(iii) of this section, a shrimp trawler must limit tow times. 
The tow time is measured from the time that the trawl door enters the 
water until it is removed from the water. For a trawl that is not 
attached to a door, the tow time is measured from the time the codend 
enters the water until it is removed from the water. Tow times may not 
exceed:
    (A) 55 minutes from April 1 through October 31; and
    (B) 75 minutes from November 1 through March 31.
    (ii) Alternative--special environmental conditions. The Assistant 
Administrator may allow compliance with tow-time restrictions, as an 
alternative to the TED requirement of paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this 
section, if the Assistant Administrator determines that the presence of 
algae, seaweed, debris or other special environmental conditions in a 
particular area makes trawling with TED-equipped nets impracticable.
    (iii) Substitute--ineffectiveness of TEDs. The Assistant 
Administrator may require compliance with tow-time restrictions, as a 
substitute for the TED requirement of paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this 
section, if the Assistant Administrator determines that TEDs are 
ineffective in protecting sea turtles.
    (iv) Notice; applicability; conditions. The Assistant Administrator 
will publish notification concerning any tow-time restriction imposed 
under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) or (iii) of this section in the Federal 
Register and will announce it in summary form on channel 16 of the 
marine VHF radio. A notification of tow-time restrictions will include 
findings in support of these restrictions as an alternative to, or as 
substitute for, the TED requirements. The notification will specify the 
effective dates, the geographic area where tow-time restrictions apply, 
and any applicable conditions or restrictions that the Assistant 
Administrator determines are necessary or appropriate to protect sea 
turtles and ensure compliance, including, but not limited to, a 
requirement to carry observers, to register vessels in accordance with 
procedures at paragraph (d)(5) of this section, or for all shrimp 
trawlers in the area to synchronize their tow times so that all trawl 
gear remains out of the water during certain times. A notification 
withdrawing tow-time restrictions will include findings in support of 
that action.
    (v) Procedures. The Assistant Administrator will consult with the 
appropriate fishery officials (state or Federal) where the affected 
shrimp fishery is located in issuing a notification concerning tow-time 
restrictions. An emergency notification can be effective for a period of 
up to 30 days and may be renewed for additional periods of up to 30 days 
each if the Assistant Administrator finds that the conditions 
necessitating the imposition of tow-time restrictions continue to exist. 
The Assistant Administrator may invite comments on such an action, and 
may withdraw or modify the action by following procedures similar to 
those for implementation. The Assistant Administrator will implement any 
permanent tow-time restriction through rulemaking.
    (4) Limitations on incidental takings during fishing activities--(i) 
Limitations. The exemption for incidental takings of sea turtles in 
paragraph (d) of this section does not authorize incidental takings 
during fishing activities if the takings:
    (A) Would violate the restrictions, terms, or conditions of an 
incidental take statement or biological opinion;
    (B) Would violate the restrictions, terms, or conditions of an 
incidental take permit; or
    (C) May be likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a species 
listed under the Act.
    (ii) Determination; restrictions on fishing activities. The 
Assistant Administrator may issue a determination that incidental 
takings during fishing activities are unauthorized. Pursuant thereto, 
the Assistant Administrator may restrict fishing activities in order to 
conserve a species listed under the Act, including, but not limited to, 
restrictions on the fishing activities of

[[Page 200]]

vessels subject to paragraph (d)(2) of this section. The Assistant 
Administrator will take such action if the Assistant Administrator 
determines that restrictions are necessary to avoid unauthorized takings 
that may be likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed 
species. The Assistant Administrator may withdraw or modify a 
determination concerning unauthorized takings or any restriction on 
fishing activities if the Assistant Administrator determines that such 
action is warranted.
    (iii) Notice; applicability; conditions. The Assistant Administrator 
will publish a notification of a determination concerning unauthorized 
takings or a notification concerning the restriction of fishing 
activities in the Federal Register. The Assistant Administrator will 
provide as much advance notice as possible, consistent with the 
requirements of the Act, and will announce the notification in summary 
form on channel 16 of the marine VHF radio. Notification of a 
determination concerning unauthorized takings will include findings in 
support of that determination; specify the fishery, including the target 
species and gear used by the fishery, the area, and the times, for which 
incidental takings are not authorized; and include such other conditions 
and restrictions as the Assistant Administrator determines are necessary 
or appropriate to protect sea turtles and ensure compliance. 
Notification of restriction of fishing activities will include findings 
in support of the restriction, will specify the time and area where the 
restriction is applicable, and will specify any applicable conditions or 
restrictions that the Assistant Administrator determines are necessary 
or appropriate to protect sea turtles and ensure compliance. Such 
conditions and restrictions may include, but are not limited to, 
limitations on the types of fishing gear that may be used, tow-time 
restrictions, alteration or extension of the periods of time during 
which particular tow-time requirements apply, requirements to use TEDs, 
registration of vessels in accordance with procedures at paragraph 
(d)(5) of this section, and requirements to provide observers. 
Notification of withdrawal or modification will include findings in 
support of that action.
    (iv) Procedures. The Assistant Administrator will consult with the 
appropriate fisheries officials (state or Federal) where the fishing 
activities are located in issuing notification of a determination 
concerning unauthorized takings or notification concerning the 
restriction of fishing activities. An emergency notification will be 
effective for a period of up to 30 days and may be renewed for 
additional periods of up to 30 days each, except that emergency 
placement of observers will be effective for a period of up to 180 days 
and may be renewed for an additional period of 60 days. The Assistant 
Administrator may invite comments on such action, and may withdraw or 
modify the action by following procedures similar to those for 
implementation. The Assistant Administrator will implement any permanent 
determination or restriction through rulemaking.
    (5)-(6) [Reserved]
    (7) Restrictions applicable to gillnet fisheries in North Carolina. 
No person may fish with gillnet fishing gear which has a stretched mesh 
size larger than 4 \1/4\ inches (10.8 cm), annually from September 1 
through December 15, in the inshore waters of Pamlico Sound, North 
Carolina, and all contiguous tidal waters, bounded on the north by 
35[deg]46.3[min] N. lat., on the south by 35[deg]00[min] N. lat., and on 
the west by 76[deg]30[min] W. long.
    (8) Restrictions applicable to large mesh gillnet fisheries in the 
mid-Atlantic region. No person may fish with or possess on board a boat, 
any gillnet with a stretched mesh size 7-inches (17.8 cm) or larger, 
unless such gillnets are covered with canvas or other similar material 
and lashed or otherwise securely fastened to the deck or the rail, and 
all buoys larger than 6-inches (15.2 cm) in diameter, high flyers, and 
anchors are disconnected. This restriction applies in the Atlantic 
Exclusive Economic Zone (as defined in 50 CFR 600.10) during the 
following time periods and in the following area:
    (i) Waters north of 33[deg] 51.0[min] N. (North Carolina/South 
Carolina border at the coast) and south of 35[deg] 46.0[min] N. (Oregon 
Inlet) at any time;

[[Page 201]]

    (ii) Waters north of 35[deg] 46.0[min] N. (Oregon Inlet) and south 
of 3[deg] 22.5[min] N. (Currituck Beach Light, NC) from March 16 through 
January 14;
    (iii) Waters north of 36[deg] 22.5[min] N. (Currituck Beach Light, 
NC) and south of 37[deg] 34.6[min] N. (Wachapreague Inlet, VA) from 
April 1 through January 14; and
    (iv) Waters north of 37[deg] 34.6[min] N. (Wachapreague Inlet, VA) 
and south of 37[deg] 56.0[min] N. (Chincoteague, VA) from April 16 
through January 14.
    (9) Restrictions applicable to Pacific pelagic longline vessels. In 
addition to the general prohibitions specified in Sec. 600.725 of 
Chapter VI, it is unlawful for any person who is not operating under a 
western Pacific longline permit under Sec. 660.21 to do any of the 
following on the high seas of the Pacific Ocean east of 150[deg] W. 
long. and north of the equator (0[deg] N. lat.):
    (i) Direct fishing effort toward the harvest of swordfish (Xiphias 
gladius) using longline gear.
    (ii) Possess a light stick on board a longline vessel. A light stick 
as used in this paragraph is any type of light emitting device, 
including any fluorescent glow bead, chemical, or electrically powered 
light that is affixed underwater to the longline gear.
    (iii) An operator of a longline vessel subject to this section may 
land or possess no more than 10 swordfish from a fishing trip where any 
part of the trip included fishing east of 150[deg] W. long. and north of 
the equator (0[deg] N. lat.).
    (iv) Fail to employ basket-style longline gear such that the 
mainline is deployed slack when fishing.
    (v) When a conventional monofilament longline is deployed by a 
vessel, no fewer than 15 branch lines may be set between any two floats. 
Vessel operators using basket-style longline gear must set a minimum of 
10 branch lines between any 2 floats.
    (vi) Longline gear must be deployed such that the deepest point of 
the main longline between any two floats, i.e., the deepest point in 
each sag of the main line, is at a depth greater than 100 m (328.1 ft or 
54.6 fm) below the sea surface.
    (10) Restrictions applicable to pound nets in Virginia--(i) Offshore 
pound net leaders in Pound Net Regulated Area I. During the time period 
of May 6 through July 15 each year, any offshore pound net leader in 
Pound Net Regulated Area I must meet the definition of a modified pound 
net leader. Any offshore pound net leader in Pound Net Regulated Area I 
that does not meet the definition of a modified pound net leader must be 
removed from the water prior to May 6 and may not be reset until July 
16.
    (ii) Nearshore pound net leaders in Pound Net Regulated Area I and 
all pound net leaders in Pound Net Regulated Area II. During the time 
period of May 6 to July 15 each year, any nearshore pound net leader in 
Pound Net Regulated Area I and any pound net leader in Pound Net 
Regulated Area II must have only mesh size less than 12 inches (30.5 cm) 
stretched mesh and may not employ stringers. Any nearshore pound net 
leader in Pound Net Regulated Area I or any pound net leader in Pound 
Net Regulated Area II with stretched mesh measuring 12 inches (30.5 cm) 
or greater, or with stringers, must be removed from the water prior to 
May 6 and may not be reset until July 16. A pound net leader is exempt 
from these measures only if it meets the definition of a modified pound 
net leader.
    (iii) Protocol for measuring mesh size. This protocol applies to 
measuring mesh size in leaders described in 50 CFR 223.206(d)(10)(i) and 
223.206(d)(10)(ii). Mesh sizes are measured by a wedge-shaped gauge 
having a taper of 0.79 in. (2 cm) in 3.15 in. (8 cm) and a thickness of 
0.09 in. (2.3 mm) inserted into the meshes under a pressure or pull of 
11.02 lb. (5 kg). The mesh size is the average of the measurement of any 
series of 20 consecutive meshes. The mesh in the leader is measured at 
or near the horizontal and vertical center of a leader panel.
    (iv) Reporting requirement. At any time during the year, if a sea 
turtle is taken live and uninjured in a pound net operation, the 
operator of the vessel must report the incident to the NMFS Northeast 
Regional Office, (978) 281-9328 or fax (978) 281-9394, within 24 hours 
of returning from the trip in which the incidental take was discovered. 
The report shall include a description of the sea turtles condition at 
the time of release and the measures

[[Page 202]]

taken as required in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. At any time 
during the year, if a sea turtle is taken in a pound net operation, and 
is determined to be injured, or if a turtle is captured dead, the 
operator of the vessel shall immediately notify NMFS Northeast Regional 
Office and the appropriate rehabilitation or stranding network, as 
determined by NMFS Northeast Regional Office.
    (v) Monitoring. Owners or operators of pound net fishing operations 
must allow access to the pound net gear so it may be observed by a NMFS-
approved observer if requested by the Northeast Regional Administrator. 
All NMFS-approved observers will report any violations of this section, 
or other applicable regulations and laws. Information collected by 
observers may be used for law enforcement purposes.
    (vi) Expedited modification of restrictions and effective dates. 
From May 6 to July 15 of each year, if NMFS receives information that 
one sea turtle is entangled alive or that one sea turtle is entangled 
dead, and NMFS determines that the entanglement contributed to its 
death, in pound net leaders that are in compliance with the restrictions 
described in paragraph (d)(10)(ii) of this section, NMFS may issue a 
final rule modifying the restrictions on pound net leaders as necessary 
to protect threatened sea turtles. Such modifications may include, but 
are not limited to, reducing the maximum allowable mesh size of pound 
net leaders and prohibiting the use of pound net leaders regardless of 
mesh size. In addition, if information indicates that a significant 
level of sea turtle entanglements, impingements or strandings will 
likely continue beyond July 15, NMFS may issue a final rule extending 
the effective date of the restrictions, including any additional 
restrictions imposed under this paragraph (d)(10)(vi), for an additional 
15 days, but not beyond July 30, to protect threatened sea turtles.
    (11) Restrictions applicable to sea scallop dredges in the mid-
Atlantic--(i) Gear Modification. During the time period of May 1 through 
November 30, any vessel with a sea scallop dredge and required to have a 
Federal Atlantic sea scallop fishery permit, regardless of dredge size 
or vessel permit category, that enters waters south of 41[deg]9.0[min] 
N. latitude, from the shoreline to the outer boundary of the Exclusive 
Economic Zone must have on each dredge a chain mat described as follows. 
The chain mat must be composed of horizontal (``tickler'') chains and 
vertical (up-and-down) chains that are configured such that the openings 
formed by the intersecting chains have no more than 4 sides. The length 
of each side of the openings formed by the intersecting chains, 
including the sweep, must be less than or equal to 14 inches (35.5 cm). 
The chains must be connected to each other with a shackle or link at 
each intersection point. The measurement must be taken along the chain, 
with the chain held taut, and include one shackle or link at the 
intersection point and all links in the chain up to, but excluding, the 
shackle or link at the other intersection point.
    (ii) Any vessel that enters the waters described in paragraph 
(d)(11)(i) of this section and that is required to have a Federal 
Atlantic sea scallop fishery permit must have the chain mat 
configuration installed on all dredges for the duration of the trip.
    (iii) Vessels subject to the requirements in paragraphs (d)(11)(i) 
and (d)(11)(ii) of this section transiting waters south of 
41[deg]9.0[min] N. latitude, from the shoreline to the outer boundary of 
the Exclusive Economic Zone, will be exempted from the chain-mat 
requirements provided the dredge gear is stowed in accordance with Sec. 
648.23(b) and there are no scallops on-board.

<R05>
Sec. 223.207  Approved TEDs.

    Any netting, webbing, or mesh that may be measured to determine 
compliance with this section is subject to measurement, regardless of 
whether it is wet or dry. Any such measurement will be of the stretched 
mesh size.
    (a) Hard TEDs. Hard TEDs are TEDs with rigid deflector grids and are 
categorized as ``hooped hard TEDs'' and ``single-grid hard TEDs'' such 
as the Matagorda and Georgia TED (Figures 3 & 4 to this part). Hard TEDs 
complying with the following generic design criteria are approved TEDs:
    (1) Construction materials--(i) Single-grid and inshore hooped hard 
TED. A single-grid hard TED or an inshore hooped hard TED must be 
constructed of one or a combination of the following materials, with 
minimum dimensions as follows:
    (A) Solid steel rod with a minimum outside diameter of 1/4 inch 
(0.64 cm);
    (B) Fiberglass or aluminum rod with a minimum outside diameter of 1/
2 inch (1.27 cm); or
    (C) Steel or aluminum tubing with a minimum outside diameter of 1/2 
inch (1.27 cm) and a minimum wall thickness of 1/8 inch (0.32 cm) (also 
known as schedule 40 tubing).
    (ii) Offshore hooped hard TED. An offshore hooped hard TED must be 
constructed of aluminum, with minimum dimensions as follows:
    (A) Solid rod with a minimum outside diameter of 5/8 inch (1.59 cm); 
or
    (B) Tubing with a minimum outside diameter of 1 inch (2.54 cm) and a 
minimum wall thickness of 1/8 inch (0.32 cm).
    (2) Method of attachment. A hard TED must be sewn into the trawl 
around the entire circumference of the TED with heavy twine.
    (3) Angle of deflector bars. (i) The angle of the deflector bars 
must be between 30[deg] and 55[deg] from the normal, horizontal flow 
through the interior of the trawl, except as provided in paragraph 
(a)(3)(ii) of this section.
    (ii) For any shrimp trawler fishing in the Gulf SFSTCA or the 
Atlantic SFSTCA, a hard TED with the position of the escape opening at 
the bottom of the net when the net is in its deployed position, the 
angle of the deflector bars from the normal, horizontal flow through the 
interior of the trawl, at any point, must not exceed 55[deg], and the 
angle of the bottom-most 4 inches (10.2 cm) of each deflector bar, 
measured along the bars, must not exceed 45[deg] (Figures 14a and 14b to 
this part).
    (4) Space between bars. The space between deflector bars and the 
deflector bars and the TED frame must not exceed 4 inches (10.2 cm).
    (5) Direction of bars. The deflector bars must run from top to 
bottom of the TED, as the TED is positioned in the net, except that up 
to four of the bottom bars and two of the top bars, including the frame, 
may run from side to side of the TED. The deflector bars must be 
permanently attached to the TED frame or to the horizontal bars, if 
used, at both ends.
    (6) Position of the escape opening. The escape opening must be made 
by removing a rectangular section of webbing from the trawl, except for 
a TED with an escape opening size described at paragraph (a)(7)(ii)(A) 
for which the escape opening may alternatively be made by making a 
horizontal cut along the same plane as the TED. The escape opening must 
be centered on and immediately forward of the frame at either the top or 
bottom of the net when the net is in the deployed position. The escape 
opening must be at the top of the net when the slope of the deflector 
bars from forward to aft is upward, and must be at the bottom when such 
slope is downward. The passage from the mouth of the trawl through the 
escape opening must be completely clear of any obstruction or 
modification, other than those specified in paragraph (d) of this 
section.
    (7) Size of escape opening--(i) Hooped hard TEDs--(A) Escape opening 
for inshore hooped hard TED. The inshore hooped hard TED escape opening 
must have a horizontal measurement of no

[[Page 204]]

less than 35 inches (89 cm) wide and a forward measurement of no less 
than 27 inches (69 cm). A hinged door frame may be used to partially 
cover the escape opening as provided in paragraph (d)(7) of this 
section. Alternatively, a webbing flap may be used as provided in 
paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section. The resultant opening with a 
webbing flap must be a minimum width of 35 inches (89 cm) and a minimum 
height of 20 inches (51 cm), with each measurement taken simultaneously. 
This opening may only be used in inshore waters, except it may not be 
used in the inshore waters of Georgia and South Carolina.
    (B) Escape opening for offshore hooped hard TED. The offshore hooped 
hard TED escape opening must have a horizontal measurement of no less 
than 40 inches (102 cm) wide and a forward measurement of no less than 
35 inches (89 cm). A hinged door frame may be used to partially cover 
the escape opening as provided in paragraph (d)(7) of this section. 
Alternatively, a webbing flap may be used as provided in paragraph 
(d)(3)(ii) of this section. The resultant escape opening with a webbing 
flap must have a stretched mesh circumference of no less than 142 inches 
(361 cm).
    (ii) Single-grid hard TEDs. On a single-grid hard TED, the 
horizontal cut(s) for the escape opening may not be narrower than the 
outside width of the TED frame minus 4 inches (10.2 cm) on both sides of 
the grid, when measured as a straight line width. Fore-and-aft cuts to 
remove a rectangular piece of webbing must be made from the ends of the 
horizontal cuts along a single row of meshes along each side. The 
overall size of the escape opening must match one of the following 
specifications:
    (A) 44-inch inshore opening. The escape opening must have a minimum 
width of 44 inches (112 cm) and a minimum height of 20 inches (51 cm) 
with each measurement taken separately. A webbing flap, as described in 
paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, may be used with this escape hole, 
so long as this minimum opening size is achieved. This opening may only 
be used in inshore waters, except it may not be used in the inshore 
waters of Georgia and South Carolina.
    (B) The 71-inch offshore opening: The two forward cuts of the escape 
opening must not be less than 26 inches (66 cm) long from the points of 
the cut immediately forward of the TED frame. The resultant length of 
the leading edge of the escape opening cut must be no less than 71 
inches (181 cm) with a resultant circumference of the opening being 142 
inches (361 cm) (Figure 12 to this part). A webbing flap, as described 
in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, may be used with this escape 
hole, so long as this minimum opening size is achieved. Either this 
opening or the one described in paragraph (a)(7)(ii)(C) of this section 
must be used in all offshore waters and in all inshore waters in Georgia 
and South Carolina, but may also be used in other inshore waters.
    (C) Double cover offshore opening. The two forward cuts of the 
escape opening must not be less than 20 inches (51 cm) long from the 
points of the cut immediately forward of the TED frame. The resultant 
length of the leading edge of the escape opening cut must be no less 
than 56 inches (142 cm)(Figure 16 to this part illustrates the 
dimensions of these cuts). A webbing flap, as described in paragraph 
(d)(3)(iii) of this section, may be used with this escape hole. Either 
this opening or the one described in paragraph (a)(7)(ii)(B) of this 
section must be used in all offshore waters but also in all inshore 
waters in Georgia and South Carolina, and may be used in other inshore 
waters.
    (8) Size of hoop or grid--(i) Hooped hard TED--(A) Inshore hooped 
hard TED. The front hoop on an inshore hooped hard TED must have an 
inside horizontal measurement of at least 35 inches (89 cm) and an 
inside vertical measurement of at least 30 inches (76 cm). The minimum 
clearance between the deflector bars and the forward edge of the escape 
opening must be at least 20 inches (51 cm).
    (B) Offshore hooped hard TED. The front hoop on an offshore hooped 
hard TED must have an inside horizontal measurement of at least 40 
inches (102 cm) and an inside vertical measurement of at least 30 inches 
(76 cm). The minimum clearance between the deflector bars and the 
forward edge of the escape opening must be at least 23 1/4 inches (59 
cm).

[[Page 205]]

    (ii) Single-grid hard TED. A single-grid hard TED must have a 
minimum outside horizontal and vertical measurement of 32 inches (81 
cm). The required outside measurements must be at the mid-point of the 
deflector grid.
    (9) Flotation. Floats must be attached to the top one-half of all 
hard TEDs with bottom escape openings. The floats may be attached either 
outside or inside the net, but not to a flap. Floats attached inside the 
net must be behind the rear surface of the TED. Floats must be attached 
with heavy twine or rope. Floats must be constructed of aluminum, hard 
plastic, expanded polyvinyl chloride, or expanded ethylene vinyl acetate 
unless otherwise specified. The requirements of this paragraph may be 
satisfied by compliance with either the dimension requirements of 
paragraph (a)(9)(i) of this section, or the buoyancy requirements of 
paragraph (a)(9)(ii) of this section, or the buoyancy-dimension 
requirements of paragraph (a)(9)(iii) of this section. If roller gear is 
used pursuant to paragraph (d)(5) of this section, the roller gear must 
be included in the circumference measurement of the TED or the total 
weight of the TED.
    (i) Float dimension requirements. (A) For hard TEDs with a 
circumference of 120 inches (304.8 cm) or more, a minimum of either one 
round, aluminum or hard plastic float, no smaller than 9.8 inches (25.0 
cm) in diameter, or two expanded polyvinyl chloride or expanded ethylene 
vinyl acetate floats, each no smaller than 6.75 inches (17.2 cm) in 
diameter by 8.75 inches (22.2 cm) in length, must be attached.
    (B) For hard TEDs with a circumference of less than 120 inches 
(304.8 cm), a minimum of either one round, aluminum or hard plastic 
float, no smaller than 9.8 inches (25.0 cm) in diameter, or one expanded 
polyvinyl chloride or expanded ethylene vinyl acetate float, no smaller 
than 6.75 inches (17.2 cm) in diameter by 8.75 inches (22.2 cm) in 
length, must be attached.
    (ii) Float buoyancy requirements. Floats of any size and in any 
combination must be attached such that the combined buoyancy of the 
floats, as marked on the floats, equals or exceeds the weight of the 
hard TED, as marked on the TED. The buoyancy of the floats and the 
weight of the TED must be clearly marked on the floats and the TED as 
follows:
    (A) Float buoyancy markings. Markings on floats must be made in 
clearly legible raised or recessed lettering by the original 
manufacturer. The marking must identify the buoyancy of the float in 
water, expressed in grams or kilograms, and must include the metric unit 
of measure. The marking may additionally include the buoyancy in English 
units. The marking must identify the nominal buoyancy for the 
manufactured float.
    (B) TED weight markings. The marking must be made by the original 
TED manufacturer and must be permanent and clearly legible. The marking 
must identify the in-air, dry weight of the TED, expressed in grams or 
kilograms, and must include the metric unit of measure. The marking may 
additionally include the weight in English units. The marked weight must 
represent the actual weight of the individual TED as manufactured. 
Previously manufactured TEDs may be marked upon return to the original 
manufacturer. Where a TED is comprised of multiple detachable 
components, the weight of each component must be separately marked.
    (iii) Buoyancy-dimension requirements. Floats of any size and in any 
combination, provided that they are marked pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(9)(ii)(A) of this section, must be attached such that the combined 
buoyancy of the floats equals or exceeds the following values:
    (A) For floats constructed of aluminum or hard plastic, regardless 
of the size of the TED grid, the combined buoyancy must equal or exceed 
14 lb (6.4 kg);
    (B) For floats constructed of expanded polyvinyl chloride or 
expanded ethylene vinyl acetate, where the circumference of the TED is 
120 inches (304.8 cm) or more, the combined buoyancy must equal or 
exceed 20 lb (9.1 kg); or
    (C) For floats constructed of expanded polyvinyl chloride or 
expanded ethylene vinyl acetate, where the circumference of the TED is 
less than 120

[[Page 206]]

inches (304.8 cm), the combined buoyancy must equal or exceed 10 lb (4.5 
kg).
    (b) Special Hard TEDs. Special hard TEDs are hard TEDs which do not 
meet all of the design and construction criteria of the generic 
standards specified in paragraph (a) of this section. The following 
special hard TEDs are approved TEDs:
    (1) Flounder TED. (Figure 10 to this part). The Flounder TED is 
approved for use only in the Atlantic summer flounder bottom trawl 
fishery. The Flounder TED is not an approved TED for use by shrimp 
trawlers. The Flounder TED must be constructed of at least 1 1/4 inch 
(3.2 cm) outside diameter aluminum or steel pipe with a wall thickness 
of at least 1/8 inch (0.3 cm). It must have a rectangular frame with 
outside dimensions which can be no less than 51 inches (129.5 cm) in 
length and 32 inches (81.3 cm) in width. It must have at least five 
vertical deflector bars, with bar spacings of no more than 4 inches 
(10.2 cm). The vertical bars must be connected to the top of the frame 
and to a single horizontal bar near the bottom. The horizontal bar must 
be connected at both ends to the sides of the frame and parallel to the 
bottom bar of the frame. There must be a space no larger than 10 inches 
(25.4 cm) between the horizontal bar and the bottom bar of the frame. 
One or more additional vertical bars running from the bottom bar to the 
horizontal bar must divide the opening at the bottom into two or more 
rectangles, each with a maximum height of 10 inches (25.4 cm) and a 
maximum width of 14 1/2 inches (36.8 cm). This TED must comply with 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The angle of the deflector bars must 
be between 30 and 55 from the normal, horizontal flow through the 
interior of the trawl. The entire width of the escape opening from the 
trawl must be centered on and immediately forward of the frame at the 
top of the net when the net is in its deployed position. The escape 
opening must be at the top of the net and the slope of the deflector 
bars from forward to aft is upward. The escape opening must be cut 
horizontally along the same plane as the TED, and may not be cut in a 
fore-and-aft direction. The cut in the trawl webbing for the escape 
opening cannot be narrower than the outside width of the grid minus 4 
inches (10.2 cm) on both sides of the grid, when measured as a straight 
line width. The resulting escape opening in the net webbing must measure 
at least 35 inches (88.9 cm) in horizontal taut length and, 
simultaneously, 12 inches (30.5 cm) in vertical taut height. The 
vertical measurement must be taken at the midpoint of the horizontal 
measurement. This TED may not be configured with a bottom escape 
opening. Installation of an accelerator funnel is not permitted with 
this TED.
    (2) Weedless TED. The weedless TED must meet all the requirements of 
paragraph (a) of this section for single-grid hard TEDs, with the 
exception of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(5) of this section. The weedless 
TED must be constructed of at least 1-1/4 inch (3.2 cm) outside diameter 
aluminum with a wall thickness of at least 1/8 inch (0.3 cm). The 
deflector bars must run from top to bottom of the TED, as the TED is 
positioned in the net. The ends of the deflectors bars on the side of 
the frame opposite to the escape opening must be permanently attached to 
the frame. The ends of the deflector bars nearest the escape opening are 
not attached to the frame and must lie entirely forward of the leading 
edge of the outer frame. The ends of the unattached deflector bars must 
be no more than 4 inches (10.2 cm) from the frame and may not extend 
past the frame. A horizontal brace bar to reinforce the deflector bars, 
constructed of the same size or larger pipe as the deflector bars, must 
be permanently attached to the frame and the rear face of each of the 
deflector bars at a position anywhere between the vertical mid-point of 
the frame and the unattached ends of the deflector bars. The horizontal 
brace bar may be offset behind the deflector bars, using spacer bars, 
not to exceed 5 inches (12.7 cm) in length and constructed of the same 
size or larger pipe as the deflector bars. See Figure 15.
    (c) Soft TEDs. Soft TEDs are TEDs with deflector panels made from 
polypropylene or polyethylene netting. The following soft TEDs are 
approved TEDs:

[[Page 207]]

    (1) Parker TED. The Parker TED is a soft TED, consisting of a single 
triangular panel, composed of webbing of two different mesh sizes, that 
forms a complete barrier inside a trawl and that angles toward an escape 
opening in the top of the trawl.
    (i) Excluder Panel. (Figure 5 to this part) The excluder panel of 
the Parker TED must be constructed of a single triangular piece of 8-
inch (20.3 cm) stretched mesh webbing and two trapezoidal pieces of 4-
inch (10.2-cm) stretched mesh webbing. The webbing must consist of 
number 48 (3-mm thick) or larger polypropylene or polyethylene webbing 
that is heat-set knotted or braided. The leading edge of the 8-inch 
(20.3-cm) mesh panel must be 36 meshes wide. The 8-inch (20.3-cm) mesh 
panel must be tapered on each side with all-bar cuts to converge on an 
apex, such that the length of each side is 36 bars. The leading edges of 
the 4-inch (10.2-cm) mesh panels must be 8 meshes wide. The edges of the 
4-inch (10.2-cm) mesh panels must be cut with all-bar cuts running 
parallel to each other, such that the length of the inner edge is 72 
bars and the length of the outer edge is 89 bars and the resulting fore-
and-aft edge is 8 meshes deep. The two 4-inch (10.2-cm) mesh panels must 
be sewn to the 8-inch (20.3-cm) mesh panel to create a single triangular 
excluder panel. The 72-bar edge of each 4-inch (10.2-cm) mesh panel must 
be securely joined with twine to one of the 36-bar edges of the 8-inch 
(20.3-cm) mesh panel, tied with knots at each knot of the 4-inch (10.2-
cm) webbing and at least two wraps of twine around each bar of 4-inch 
(10.2-cm) mesh and the adjoining bar of the 8-inch (20.3-cm) mesh. The 
adjoining fore-and-aft edges of the two 4-inch (10.2-cm) mesh panels 
must be sewn together evenly.
    (ii) Limitations on which trawls may have a Parker TED installed. 
The Parker TED must not be installed or used in a two-seam trawl with a 
tongue, nor in a triple-wing trawl (a trawl with a tongue along the 
headrope and a second tongue along the footrope). The Parker TED may be 
installed and used in any other trawl if the taper of the body panels of 
the trawl does not exceed 4b1p and if it can be properly installed in 
compliance with paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (iii) Panel installation--(A) Leading edge attachment. The leading 
edge of the excluder panel must be attached to the inside of the bottom 
of the trawl across a straight row of meshes. For a two-seam trawl or a 
four-seam, tapered-wing trawl, the row of meshes for attachment to the 
trawl must run the entire width of the bottom body panel, from seam to 
seam. For a four-seam, straight-wing trawl, the row of meshes for 
attachment to the trawl must run the entire width of the bottom body 
panel and half the height of each wing panel of the trawl. Every mesh of 
the leading edge of the excluder panel must be evenly sewn to this row 
of meshes; meshes may not be laced to the trawl. The row of meshes for 
attachment to the trawl must contain the following number of meshes, 
depending on the stretched mesh size used in the trawl:
    (1) For a mesh size of 2\1/4\ inches (5.7 cm), 152-168 meshes;
    (2) For a mesh size of 2\1/8\ inches (5.4 cm), 161-178 meshes;
    (3) For a mesh size of 2 inches (5.1 cm), 171-189 meshes;
    (4) For a mesh size of 1\7/8\ inches (4.8 cm), 182-202 meshes;
    (5) For a mesh size of 1\3/4\ inches (4.4 cm), 196-216 meshes;
    (6) For a mesh size of 1\5/8\ inches (4.1 cm), 211-233 meshes;
    (7) For a mesh size of 1\1/2\ inches (3.8 cm), 228-252 meshes;
    (8) For a mesh size of 1\3/8\ inches (3.5 cm), 249-275 meshes; and
    (9) For a mesh size of 1\1/4\ inches (3.2 cm), 274-302 meshes.
    (B) Apex attachment. The apex of the triangular excluder panel must 
be attached to the inside of the top body panel of the trawl at the 
centerline of the trawl. The distance, measured aft along the centerline 
of the top body panel from the same row of meshes for attachment of the 
excluder panel to the bottom body panel of the trawl, to the apex 
attachment point must contain the following number of meshes, depending 
on the stretched mesh size used in the trawl:
    (1) For a mesh size of 2\1/4\ inches (5.7 cm), 78-83 meshes;
    (2) For a mesh size of 2\1/8\ inches (5.4 cm), 83-88 meshes;

[[Page 208]]

    (3) For a mesh size of 2 inches (5.1 cm), 87-93 meshes;
    (4) For a mesh size of 1\7/8\ inches (4.8 cm), 93-99 meshes;
    (5) For a mesh size of 1\3/4\ inches (4.4 cm), 100-106 meshes;
    (6) For a mesh size of 1\5/8\ inches (4.1 cm), 107-114 meshes;
    (7) For a mesh size of 1\1/2\ inches (3.8 cm), 114-124 meshes;
    (8) For a mesh size of 1\3/8\ inches (3.5 cm), 127-135 meshes; and
    (9) For a mesh size of 1\1/4\ inches (3.2 cm), 137-146 meshes.
    (C) Side attachment. The sides of the excluder panel must be 
attached evenly to the inside of the trawl from the outside attachment 
points of the excluder panel's leading edge to the apex of the excluder 
panel. Each side must be sewn with the same sewing sequence, and, if the 
sides of the excluder panel cross rows of bars in the trawl, the 
crossings must be distributed evenly over the length of the side 
attachment.
    (iv) Escape opening. The escape opening for the Parker soft TED must 
match one of the following specifications:
    (A) Inshore opening. This opening is the minimum size opening that 
may be used in inshore waters, except it may not be used in the inshore 
waters of Georgia and South Carolina, in which a larger minimum opening 
is required. A slit at least 56 inches (1.4 m) in taut length must be 
cut along the centerline of the top body panel of the trawl net 
immediately forward of the apex of the panel webbing. The slit must not 
be covered or closed in any manner. The edges and end points of the slit 
must not be reinforced in any way; for example, by attaching additional 
rope or webbing or by changing the orientation of the webbing.
    (B) Offshore opening. A horizontal cut extending from the attachment 
of one side of the deflector panel to the trawl to the attachment of the 
other side of the deflector panel to the trawl must be made in a single 
row of meshes across the top of the trawl and measure at least 96 inches 
(244 cm) in taut width. All trawl webbing above the deflector panel 
between the 96-inch (244-cm) cut and edges of the deflector panel must 
be removed. A rectangular flap of nylon webbing not larger than 2-inch 
(5.1-cm) stretched mesh may be sewn to the forward edge of the escape 
opening. The width of the flap must not be larger than the width of the 
forward edge of the escape opening. The flap must not extend more than 
12 inches (30.4 cm) beyond the rear point of the escape opening. The 
sides of the flap may be attached to the top of the trawl but must not 
be attached farther aft than the row of meshes through the rear point of 
the escape opening. One row of steel chain not larger than\3/16\ inch 
(4.76 mm) may be sewn evenly to the back edge of the flap. The stretched 
length of the chain must not exceed 96 inches (244 cm). A Parker TED 
using the escape opening described in this paragraph meets the 
requirements of Sec. 223.206(d)(2)(iv)(B). This opening or one that is 
larger must be used in all offshore waters and in the inshore waters of 
Georgia and South Carolina. It also may be used in other inshore waters.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (d) Allowable modifications to hard TEDs and special hard TEDs. 
Unless otherwise prohibited in paragraph (b) of this section, only the 
following modifications may be made to an approved hard TED or an 
approved special hard TED:
    (1) Floats. In addition to floats required pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(9) of this section, floats may be attached to the top one-half of 
the TED, either outside or inside the net, but not to a flap. Floats 
attached inside the net must be behind the rear surface at the top of 
the TED.
    (2) Accelerator funnel. An accelerator funnel may be installed in 
the trawl, if it is made of net webbing material with a stretched mesh 
size of not greater than 1 5/8 inches (4 cm), if it is inserted in the 
net immediately forward of the TED, and if its rear edge does not extend 
past the bars of the TED. The trailing edge of the accelerator funnel 
may be attached to the TED on the side opposite the escape opening if 
not more than one-third of the circumference of the funnel is attached, 
and if the inside horizontal opening as described above in maintained. 
In a bottom opening TED only the top one-third of the circumference of 
the funnel may be attached to the TED. In a

[[Page 209]]

top opening TED only the bottom one-third of the circumference of the 
funnel may be attached to the TED.
    (i) In inshore waters, other than the inshore waters of Georgia and 
South Carolina in which a larger opening is required, the inside 
horizontal opening of the accelerator funnel must be at least 44 inches 
(112 cm).
    (ii) In offshore waters and the inshore waters of Georgia and South 
Carolina, the inside horizontal opening of the accelerator funnel must 
be at least 71 inches (180 cm).
    (3) Webbing flap. A webbing flap may be used to cover the escape 
opening under the following conditions: No device holds it closed or 
otherwise restricts the opening; it is constructed of webbing with a 
stretched mesh size no larger than 1-5/8 inches (4 cm); it lies on the 
outside of the trawl; it is attached along its entire forward edge 
forward of the escape opening; it is not attached on the sides beyond 
the row of meshes that lies 6 inches (15 cm) behind the posterior edge 
of the grid; the sides of the flap are sewn on the same row of meshes 
fore and aft; and the flap does not overlap the escape hole cut by more 
than 5 inches (13 cm) on either side.
    (i) 44-inch inshore TED flap. This flap may not extend more than 24 
inches (61 cm) beyond the posterior edge of the grid.
    (ii) 71-inch offshore TED Flap. The flap must be a 133-inch (338-cm) 
by 52-inch (132-cm) piece of webbing. The 133-inch (338-cm) edge of the 
flap is attached to the forward edge of the opening (71-inch (180-cm) 
edge). The flap may extend no more than 24 inches (61 cm) behind the 
posterior edge of the grid (Figure 12 to this part illustrates this 
flap).
    (iii) Double cover flap offshore TED flap. This flap must be 
composed of two equal size rectangular panels of webbing. Each panel 
must be no less than 58 inches (147 cm) wide and may overlap each other 
no more than 15 inches (38 cm). The panels may only be sewn together 
along the leading edge of the cut. The trailing edge of each panel must 
not extend more than 24 inches (61 cm) past the posterior edge of the 
grid (Figure 16 to this part). Each panel may be sewn down the entire 
length of the outside edge of each panel. Chafing webbing described in 
paragraph (d)(4) of this section may not be used with this type of flap.
    (A) Edge lines. Optional edge lines can be used in conjunction with 
this flap. The line must be made of polyethylene with a maximum diameter 
of 3/8 inches (.95 cm). A single length of line must be used for each 
flap panel. The line must be sewn evenly to the unattached, inside edges 
and trailing edges, of each flap panel. When edge lines are installed, 
the outside edge of each flap panel must be attached along the entire 
length of the flap panel.
    (B) [Reserved]
    (4) Chafing webbing. A single piece of nylon webbing, with a twine 
size no smaller than size 36 (2.46 mm in diameter), may be attached 
outside of the escape opening webbing flap to prevent chafing on bottom 
opening TEDs. This webbing may be attached along its leading edge only. 
This webbing may not extend beyond the trailing edge or sides of the 
existing escape opening webbing flap, and it must not interfere or 
otherwise restrict the turtle escape opening.
    (5) Roller gear. Roller gear may be attached to the bottom of a TED 
to prevent chafing on the bottom of the TED and the trawl net. When a 
webbing flap is used in conjunction with roller gear, the webbing flap 
must be of a length such that no part of the webbing flap can touch or 
come in contact with any part of the roller gear assembly or the means 
of attachment of the roller gear assembly to the TED, when the trawl net 
is in its normal, horizontal position. Roller gear must be constructed 
according to one of the following design criteria:
    (i) A single roller consisting of hard plastic shall be mounted on 
an axle rod, so that the roller can roll freely about the axle. The 
maximum diameter of the roller shall be 6 inches (15.24 cm), and the 
maximum width of the axle rod shall be 12 inches (30.4 cm). The axle rod 
must be attached to the TED by two support rods. The maximum clearance 
between the roller and the TED shall not exceed 1 inch (2.5 cm) at the 
center of the roller. The support rods and axle rod must be

[[Page 210]]

made from solid steel or solid aluminum rod no larger than \1/2\ inch 
(1.28 cm) in diameter. The attachment of the support rods to the TED 
shall be such that there are no protrusions (lips, sharp edges, burrs, 
etc.) on the front face of the grid. The axle rod and support rods must 
lie entirely behind the plane of the face of the TED grid.
    (ii) A single roller consisting of hard plastic tubing shall be 
tightly tied to the back face of the TED grid with rope or heavy twine 
passed through the center of the roller tubing. The roller shall lie 
flush against the TED. The maximum outside diameter of the roller shall 
be 3\1/2\ inches (8.0 cm), the minimum outside diameter of the roller 
shall be 2 inches (5.1 cm), and the maximum length of the roller shall 
be 12 inches (30.4 cm). The roller must lie entirely behind the plane of 
the face of the grid.
    (6) Water deflector fin for hooped hard TEDs. On a hooped hard TED, 
a water deflector fin may be welded to the forward edge of the escape 
opening. The fin must be constructed of a flat aluminum bar, up to 3/8 
inch (0.95 cm) thick and up to 4 inches (10.2 cm) deep. The fin may be 
as wide as the width of the escape opening, minus 1 inch (2.5 cm). The 
fin must project aft into the TED with an angle between 5[deg] and 
45[deg] from the normal, horizontal plane of the trawl. On an inshore 
hooped hard TED, the clearance between the deflector bars and the 
posterior edge of the deflector fin must be at least 20 inches (51 cm). 
On an offshore hooped hard TED, the clearance between the deflector bars 
and the posterior edge of the deflector fin must be at least 23-1/4 
inches (59 cm).
    (7) Hinged door frame for hooped hard TEDs. A hinged door frame may 
be attached to the forward edge of the escape opening on a hooped hard 
TED. The door frame must be constructed of materials specified at 
paragraphs (a)(1)(i) or (a)(1)(ii) of this section for inshore and 
offshore hooped hard TEDs, respectively. The door frame may be covered 
with a single panel of mesh webbing that is taut and securely attached 
with twine to the perimeter of the door frame, with a mesh size not 
greater than that used for the TED extension webbing. The door frame 
must be at least as wide as the TED escape opening. The door frame may 
be a maximum of 24 inches (61 cm) long. The door frame must be connected 
to the forward edge of the escape opening by a hinge device that allows 
the door to open outwards freely. The posterior edge of the door frame, 
in the closed position, must lie at least 12 inches (30 cm) forward of 
the posterior edge of the escape opening. A water deflector fin may be 
welded to the posterior edge of the hinged door frame. The fin must be 
constructed of a flat aluminum bar, up to 3/8 inch (0.95 cm) thick and 
up to four inches (10.2 cm) deep. The fin may be as wide as the width of 
the escape opening, minus one inch (2.5 cm). The fin must project aft 
into the TED with an angle between 5[deg] and 45[deg] from the normal, 
horizontal plane of the trawl, when the door is in the closed position. 
The clearance between the posterior edge of the escape opening and the 
posterior edge of the door frame or the posterior edge of the water 
deflector fin, if installed, must be no less than 12 inches (30 cm), 
when the door is in the closed position. Two stopper ropes or a hinge 
limiter may be used to limit the maximum opening height of the hinged 
door frame, as long as they do not obstruct the escape opening in any 
way or restrict the free movement of the door to its fully open 
position. When the door is in its fully open position, the minimum 
clearance between any part of the deflector bars and any part of the 
door, including a water deflector fin if installed, must be at least 20 
inches (51 cm) for an inshore hooped hard TED and at least 23 1/4 inches 
(59 cm) for an offshore hooped hard TED. The hinged door frame may not 
be used in combination with a webbing flap specified at paragraph (d)(3) 
of this section or with a water deflection fin specified at paragraph 
(d)(6) of this section.
    (e) Revision of generic design criteria, and approval of TEDs, of 
allowable modifications of hard TEDs, and of special hard TEDs. (1) The 
Assistant Administrator may revise the generic design criteria for hard 
TEDs set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, may approve special 
hard TEDs in addition to those listed in paragraph (b) of this section, 
may approve allowable modifications to hard TEDs in addition to

[[Page 211]]

those authorized in paragraph (d) of this section, or may approve other 
TEDs, by regulatory amendment, if, according to a NMFS-approved 
scientific protocol, the TED demonstrates a sea turtle exclusion rate of 
97 percent or greater (or an equivalent exclusion rate). Two such 
protocols have been published by NMFS (52 FR 24262, June 29, 1987; and 
55 FR 41092, October 9, 1990) and will be used only for testing relating 
to hard TED designs. Testing under any protocol must be conducted under 
the supervision of the Assistant Administrator, and shall be subject to 
all such conditions and restrictions as the Assistant Administrator 
deems appropriate. Any person wishing to participate in such testing 
should contact the Director, Southeast Fisheries Science Center, NMFS, 
75 Virginia Beach Dr., Miami, FL 33149-1003.
    (2) Upon application, the Assistant Administrator may issue permits, 
subject to such conditions and restrictions as the Assistant 
Administrator deems appropriate, authorizing public or private 
experimentation aimed at improving shrimp retention efficiency of 
existing approved TEDs and at developing additional TEDs, or conducting 
fishery research, that would otherwise be subject to Sec. 
223.206(d)(2). Applications should be made to the Southeast Regional 
Administrator (see Sec. 222.102 definition of ``Southeast Regional 
Administrator'').

Sec. 224.102  Permits for endangered marine and anadromous species.

    No person shall take, import, export, or engage in any activity 
prohibited by section 9 of the Act involving any marine species that has 
been determined to be endangered under the Endangered Species 
Conservation Act of 1969 or the Act, and that is under the jurisdiction 
of the Secretary, without a valid permit issued pursuant to part 222, 
subpart C of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 224.103  Special prohibitions for endangered marine mammals.

    (a) Approaching humpback whales in Hawaii. Except as provided in 
part 222, subpart C, of this chapter (General Permit Procedures), it is 
unlawful for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States 
to commit, to attempt to commit, to solicit another to

[[Page 223]]

commit, or to cause to be committed, within 200 nautical miles (370.4 
km) of the Islands of Hawaii, any of the following acts with respect to 
humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae):
    (1) Operate any aircraft within 1,000 feet (300 m) of any humpback 
whale;
    (2) Approach, by any means, within 100 yard (90 m) of any humpback 
whale;
    (3) Cause a vessel or other object to approach within 100 yd (90 m) 
of a humpback whale; or
    (4) Disrupt the normal behavior or prior activity of a whale by any 
other act or omission. A disruption of normal behavior may be manifested 
by, among other actions on the part of the whale, a rapid change in 
direction or speed; escape tactics such as prolonged diving, underwater 
course changes, underwater exhalation, or evasive swimming patterns; 
interruptions of breeding, nursing, or resting activities, attempts by a 
whale to shield a calf from a vessel or human observer by tail swishing 
or by other protective movement; or the abandonment of a previously 
frequented area.
    (b) Approaching humpback whales in Alaska--(1) Prohibitions. Except 
as provided under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, it is unlawful for 
any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to commit, 
to attempt to commit, to solicit another to commit, or to cause to be 
committed, within 200 nautical miles (370.4 km) of Alaska, or within 
inland waters of the state, any of the acts in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) 
through (b)(1)(iii) of this section with respect to humpback whales 
(Megaptera novaeangliae):
    (i) Approach, by any means, including by interception (i.e., placing 
a vessel in the path of an oncoming humpback whale so that the whale 
surfaces within 100 yards (91.4 m) of the vessel), within 100 yards 
(91.4 m) of any humpback whale;
    (ii) Cause a vessel or other object to approach within 100 yards 
(91.4 m) of a humpback whale; or
    (iii) Disrupt the normal behavior or prior activity of a whale by 
any other act or omission, as described in paragraph (a)(4) of this 
section.
    (2) Exceptions. The following exceptions apply to this paragraph 
(b), but any person who claims the applicability of an exception has the 
burden of proving that the exception applies:
    (i) Paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not apply if an approach 
is authorized by the National Marine Fisheries Service through a permit 
issued under part 222, subpart C, of this chapter (General Permit 
Procedures) or through a similar authorization.
    (ii) Paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not apply to the extent 
that a vessel is restricted in her ability to maneuver and, because of 
the restriction, cannot comply with paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (iii) Paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not apply to commercial 
fishing vessels lawfully engaged in actively setting, retrieving or 
closely tending commercial fishing gear. For purposes of this paragraph 
(b), commercial fishing means taking or harvesting fish or fishery 
resources to sell, barter, or trade. Commercial fishing does not include 
commercial passenger fishing operations (i.e. charter operations or 
sport fishing activities).
    (iv) Paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not apply to state, 
local, or Federal government vessels operating in the course of official 
duty.
    (v) Paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not affect the rights of 
Alaska Natives under 16 U.S.C. 1539(e).
    (vi) These regulations shall not take precedence over any more 
restrictive conflicting Federal regulation pertaining to humpback 
whales, including the regulations at 36 CFR 13.65 that pertain 
specifically to the waters of Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve.
    (3) General measures. Notwithstanding the prohibitions and 
exceptions in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, to avoid 
collisions with humpback whales, vessels must operate at a slow, safe 
speed when near a humpback whale. ``Safe speed'' has the same meaning as 
the term is defined in 33 U.S.C. 2006 and the International Regulations 
for Preventing Collisions at Sea 1972 (see 33 U.S.C. 1602), with respect 
to avoiding collisions with humpback whales.
    (c) Approaching right whales--(1) Prohibitions. Except as provided 
under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, it is unlawful for any person 
subject to the

[[Page 224]]

jurisdiction of the United States to commit, attempt to commit, to 
solicit another to commit, or cause to be committed any of the following 
acts:
    (i) Approach (including by interception) within 500 yards (460 m) of 
a right whale by vessel, aircraft, or any other means;
    (ii) Fail to undertake required right whale avoidance measures 
specified under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
    (2) Right whale avoidance measures. Except as provided under 
paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the following avoidance measures must 
be taken if within 500 yards (460 m) of a right whale:
    (i) If underway, a vessel must steer a course away from the right 
whale and immediately leave the area at a slow safe speed.
    (ii) An aircraft must take a course away from the right whale and 
immediately leave the area at a constant airspeed.
    (3) Exceptions. The following exceptions apply to this section, but 
any person who claims the applicability of an exception has the burden 
of proving that the exception applies:
    (i) Paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section do not apply if a 
right whale approach is authorized by the National Marine Fisheries 
Service through a permit issued under part 222, subpart C, of this 
chapter (General Permit Procedures) or through a similar authorization.
    (ii) Paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section do not apply where 
compliance would create an imminent and serious threat to a person, 
vessel, or aircraft.
    (iii) Paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section do not apply when 
approaching to investigate a right whale entanglement or injury, or to 
assist in the disentanglement or rescue of a right whale, provided that 
permission is received from the National Marine Fisheries Service or 
designee prior to the approach.
    (iv) Paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section do not apply to an 
aircraft unless the aircraft is conducting whale watch activities.
    (v) Paragraph (c)(2) of this section does not apply to the extent 
that a vessel is restricted in her ability to maneuver and, because of 
the restriction, cannot comply with paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
    (d) Special prohibitions relating to endangered Steller sea lion 
protection. The regulatory provisions set forth in part 223 of this 
chapter, which govern threatened Steller sea lions, shall also apply to 
the western population of Steller sea lions, which consists of all 
Steller sea lions from breeding colonies located west of 144[deg] W. 
long.

                  Steller Sea Lion (Eumetopias jubatus)

    (a) Alaska rookeries, haulouts, and associated areas. In Alaska, all 
major Steller sea lion rookeries identified in Table 1 and major 
haulouts identified in Table 2 and associated terrestrial, air, and 
aquatic zones. Critical habitat includes a terrestrial zone that extends 
3,000 feet (0.9 km) landward from the baseline or base point of each 
major rookery and major haulout in Alaska. Critical habitat includes an 
air zone that extends 3,000 feet (0.9 km) above the terrestrial zone of 
each major rookery and major haulout in Alaska, measured vertically from 
sea level. Critical habitat includes an aquatic zone that extends 3,000 
feet (0.9 km) seaward in State and Federally managed waters from the 
baseline or basepoint of each major rookery and major haulout in Alaska 
that is east of 144[deg] W. longitude. Critical habitat includes an 
aquatic zone that extends 20 nm (37 km) seaward in State and Federally 
managed waters from the baseline or basepoint of each major rookery and 
major haulout in Alaska that is west of 144[deg] W. longitude.
    (b) California and Oregon rookeries and associated areas. In 
California and Oregon, all major Steller sea lion rookeries identified 
in Table 1 and associated air and aquatic zones. Critical habitat 
includes an air zone that extends 3,000 feet (0.9 km) above areas 
historically occupied by sea lions at each major rookery in California 
and Oregon, measured vertically from sea level. Critical habitat 
includes an aquatic zone that extends 3,000 feet (0.9 km) seaward in 
State and Federally managed waters from the baseline or basepoint of 
each major rookery in California and Oregon.
    (c) Three special aquatic foraging areas in Alaska. Three special 
aquatic foraging areas in Alaska, including the Shelikof Strait area, 
the Bogoslof area, and the Seguam Pass area.
    (1) Critical habitat includes the Shelikof Strait area in the Gulf

    (b) Critical habitat boundaries. Critical habitat includes the 
stream channels within the designated stream reaches, and includes a 
lateral extent as defined by the ordinary high-water line (33 CFR 
329.11). In areas where the ordinary high-water line has not been 
defined, the lateral extent will be defined by the bankfull elevation. 
Bankfull elevation is the level at which water begins to leave the 
channel and move into the floodplain and is reached at a discharge which 
generally has a recurrence interval of 1 to 2 years on the annual flood 
series. Critical habitat in estuaries (e.g. San Francisco-San Pablo-
Suisun Bay, Humboldt Bay, and Morro Bay) is defined by the perimeter of 
the water body as displayed on standard 1:24,000 scale topographic maps 
or the elevation of extreme high water, whichever is greater.
    (c) Primary constituent elements. Within these areas, the primary 
constituent elements essential for the conservation of these ESUs are 
those sites and habitat components that support one or more life stages, 
including:
    (1) Freshwater spawning sites with water quantity and quality 
conditions and substrate supporting spawning, incubation and larval 
development;
    (2) Freshwater rearing sites with:
    (i) Water quantity and floodplain connectivity to form and maintain 
physical habitat conditions and support juvenile growth and mobility;
    (ii) Water quality and forage supporting juvenile development; and
    (iii) Natural cover such as shade, submerged and overhanging large 
wood, log jams and beaver dams, aquatic vegetation, large rocks and 
boulders, side channels, and undercut banks.
    (3) Freshwater migration corridors free of obstruction and excessive 
predation with water quantity and quality conditions and natural cover 
such as submerged and overhanging large wood, aquatic vegetation, large 
rocks and boulders, side channels, and undercut banks supporting 
juvenile and adult mobility and survival.
    (4) Estuarine areas free of obstruction and excessive predation 
with:
    (i) Water quality, water quantity, and salinity conditions 
supporting juvenile and adult physiological transitions between fresh- 
and saltwater;
    (ii) Natural cover such as submerged and overhanging large wood, 
aquatic vegetation, large rocks and boulders, side channels; and
    (iii) Juvenile and adult forage, including aquatic invertebrates and 
fishes, supporting growth and maturation.
    (d) Exclusion of Indian lands. Critical habitat does not include 
occupied habitat areas on Indian lands. The Indian lands specifically 
excluded from critical habitat are those defined in the Secretarial 
Order, including:
    (1) Lands held in trust by the United States for the benefit of any 
Indian tribe;
    (2) Land held in trust by the United States for any Indian Tribe or 
individual subject to restrictions by the United States against 
alienation;
    (3) Fee lands, either within or outside the reservation boundaries, 
owned by the tribal government; and
    (4) Fee lands within the reservation boundaries owned by individual 
Indians.
    (e) Land owned or controlled by the Department of Defense. 
Additionally, critical habitat does not include the following areas 
owned or controlled by the Department of Defense, or designated for its 
use, that are subject to an integrated natural resources management plan 
prepared under section 101 of the Sikes Act (16 U.S.C. 670a):
    (1) Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base;
    (2) Vandenberg Air Force Base;

Sec. 226.212  Critical habitat for 13 Evolutionarily Significant 
Units (ESUs) of salmon and steelhead (Oncorhynchus spp.)

in Washington, Oregon and Idaho.

    Critical habitat is designated in the following states and counties 
for the following ESUs as described in paragraph (a) of this section, 
and as further described in paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section. 
The textual descriptions of critical habitat for each ESU are included 
in paragraphs (i) through (u) of this section, and these descriptions 
are the definitive source for determining the critical habitat 
boundaries. General location maps are provided at the end of each ESU 
description (paragraphs (i) through (u) of this section) and are 
provided for general guidance purposes only, and not as a definitive 
source for determining critical habitat boundaries.

    (b) Critical habitat boundaries. Critical habitat includes the 
stream channels within the designated stream reaches, and includes a 
lateral extent as defined by the ordinary high-water line (33 CFR 
319.11). In areas where ordinary high-water line has not been defined, 
the lateral extent will be defined by

[[Page 342]]

the bankfull elevation. Bankfull elevation is the level at which water 
begins to leave the channel and move into the floodplain and is reached 
at a discharge which generally has a recurrence interval of 1 to 2 years 
on the annual flood series. Critical habitat in lake areas is defined by 
the perimeter of the water body as displayed on standard 1:24,000 scale 
topographic maps or the elevation of ordinary high water, whichever is 
greater. In estuarine and nearshore marine areas critical habitat 
includes areas contiguous with the shoreline from the line of extreme 
high water out to a depth no greater than 30 meters relative to mean 
lower low water.
    (c) Primary constituent elements. Within these areas, the primary 
constituent elements essential for the conservation of these ESUs are 
those sites and habitat components that support one or more life stages, 
including:
    (1) Freshwater spawning sites with water quantity and quality 
conditions and substrate supporting spawning, incubation and larval 
development;
    (2) Freshwater rearing sites with:
    (i) Water quantity and floodplain connectivity to form and maintain 
physical habitat conditions and support juvenile growth and mobility;
    (ii) Water quality and forage supporting juvenile development; and
    (iii) Natural cover such as shade, submerged and overhanging large 
wood, log jams and beaver dams, aquatic vegetation, large rocks and 
boulders, side channels, and undercut banks.
    (3) Freshwater migration corridors free of obstruction and excessive 
predation with water quantity and quality conditions and natural cover 
such as submerged and overhanging large wood, aquatic vegetation, large 
rocks and boulders, side channels, and undercut banks supporting 
juvenile and adult mobility and survival;
    (4) Estuarine areas free of obstruction and excessive predation 
with:
    (i) Water quality, water quantity, and salinity conditions 
supporting juvenile and adult physiological transitions between fresh- 
and saltwater;
    (ii) Natural cover such as submerged and overhanging large wood, 
aquatic vegetation, large rocks and boulders, side channels; and
    (iii) Juvenile and adult forage, including aquatic invertebrates and 
fishes, supporting growth and maturation.
    (5) Nearshore marine areas free of obstruction and excessive 
predation with:
    (i) Water quality and quantity conditions and forage, including 
aquatic invertebrates and fishes, supporting growth and maturation; and
    (ii) Natural cover such as submerged and overhanging large wood, 
aquatic vegetation, large rocks and boulders, and side channels.
    (6) Offshore marine areas with water quality conditions and forage, 
including aquatic invertebrates and fishes, supporting growth and 
maturation.
    (d) Exclusion of Indian lands. Critical habitat does not include 
habitat areas on Indian lands. The Indian lands specifically excluded 
from critical habitat are those defined in the Secretarial Order, 
including:
    (1) Lands held in trust by the United States for the benefit of any 
Indian tribe;
    (2) Land held in trust by the United States for any Indian Tribe or 
individual subject to restrictions by the United States against 
alienation;
    (3) Fee lands, either within or outside the reservation boundaries, 
owned by the tribal government; and
    (4) Fee lands within the reservation boundaries owned by individual 
Indians.
    (e) Land owned or controlled by the Department of Defense. Critical 
habitat does not include any areas subject to an approved Integrated 
Natural Resource Management Plan or associated with Department of 
Defense easements or right-of-ways. In areas within Navy security zones 
identified at 33 CFR 334 that are outside the areas described above, 
critical habitat is only designated within a narrow nearshore zone from 
the line of extreme high tide down to the line of mean lower low water. 
The specific sites addressed include:
    (1) Naval Submarine Base, Bangor;
    (2) Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Keyport;

Sec. 226.214  Critical habitat for Gulf sturgeon.

    Gulf sturgeon is under the joint jurisdiction of the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service (FWS) and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). The 
FWS will maintain primary responsibility for recovery actions and NMFS 
will assist in and continue to fund recovery actions pertaining to 
estuarine and marine habitats. In riverine units, the FWS will be 
responsible for all consultations regarding Gulf sturgeon and critical 
habitat. In estuarine units, we

[[Page 586]]

will divide responsibility based on the action agency involved. The FWS 
will consult with the Department of Transportation, the Environmental 
Protection Agency, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency. NMFS will consult with the Department of Defense, 
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Minerals Management Service and any other 
Federal agencies not mentioned here explicitly. In marine units, NMFS 
will be responsible for all consultations regarding Gulf sturgeon and 
critical habitat. Any Federal projects that extend into the jurisdiction 
of both the Services will be consulted on by the FWS with internal 
coordination with NMFS. Each agency will conduct its own intra-agency 
consultations as necessary.
    The primary constituent elements essential for the conservation of 
Gulf sturgeon are those habitat components that support feeding, 
resting, and sheltering, reproduction, migration, and physical features 
necessary for maintaining the natural processes that support these 
habitat components. The primary constituent elements include: abundant 
prey items within riverine habitats for larval and juvenile life stages, 
and within estuarine and marine habitats and substrates for juvenile, 
subadult, and adult life stages; riverine spawning sites with substrates 
suitable for egg deposition and development, such as limestone outcrops 
and cut limestone banks, bedrock, large gravel or cobble beds, marl, 
soapstone or hard clay; riverine aggregation areas, also referred to as 
resting, holding, and staging areas, used by adult, subadult, and/or 
juveniles, generally, but not always, located in holes below normal 
riverbed depths, believed necessary for minimizing energy expenditures 
during fresh water residency and possibly for osmoregulatory functions; 
a flow regime (i.e., the magnitude, frequency, duration, seasonality, 
and rate-of-change of fresh water discharge over time) necessary for 
normal behavior, growth, and survival of all life stages in the riverine 
environment, including migration, breeding site selection, courtship, 
egg fertilization, resting, and staging; and necessary for maintaining 
spawning sites in suitable condition for egg attachment, eggs 
sheltering, resting, and larvae staging; water quality, including 
temperature, salinity, pH, hardness, turbidity, oxygen content, and 
other chemical characteristics, necessary for normal behavior, growth, 
and viability of all life stages; sediment quality, including texture 
and other chemical characteristics, necessary for normal behavior, 
growth, and viability of all life stages; and safe and unobstructed 
migratory pathways necessary for passage within and between riverine, 
estuarine, and marine habitats (e.g. a river unobstructed by any 
permanent structure, or a dammed river that still allows for passage).
    The river reaches within Units 1 to 7 as critical habitat lie within 
the ordinary high water line. As defined in 33 CFR 329.11, the ordinary 
high water line on non-tidal rivers is the line on the shore established 
by the fluctuations of water and indicated by physical characteristics 
such as a clear, natural line impressed on the bank; shelving; changes 
in the character of soil; destruction of terrestrial vegetation; the 
presence of litter and debris; or other appropriate means that consider 
the characteristics of the surrounding areas.
    The downstream limit of the riverine units is the mouth of each 
river. The mouth is defined as rkm 0 (rmi 0). Although the interface of 
fresh and saltwater, referred to as the saltwater wedge, occurs within 
the lower-most reach of a river, for ease in delineating critical 
habitat units, we are defining the boundary between the riverine and 
estuarine units as rkm 0 (rmi 0).
    Regulatory jurisdiction in coastal areas extends to the line on the 
shore reached by the plane of the mean (average) high water (MHW) (33 
CFR 329.12(a)(2)). All bays and estuaries within Units 8 to 14, 
therefore, lie below the MHW lines. Where precise determination of the 
actual location becomes necessary, it must be established by survey with 
reference to the available tidal datum, preferably averaged over a 
period of 18.6 years. Less precise methods, such as observation of the 
``apparent shoreline'' which is determined by reference to physical 
markings, lines of vegetation, may be used only where an estimate is 
needed

[[Page 587]]

of the line reached by the mean high water.
    The term 72 COLREGS is defined as demarcation lines which delineate 
those waters upon which mariners shall comply with the International 
Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 and those waters upon 
which mariners shall comply with the Inland Navigation Rules (33 CFR 
80.01). The waters inside of these lines are Inland Rules waters and the 
waters outside the lines are COLREGS waters. These lines are defined in 
33 CFR part 80, and have been used for identification purposes to 
delineate boundary lines of the estuarine and marine habitat Units 8, 9, 
11, and 12.
    Critical habitat does not include existing developed sites such as 
dams, piers, marinas, bridges, boat ramps, exposed oil and gas 
pipelines, oil rigs, and similar structures or designated public 
swimming areas.
    Critical habitat units are depicted for Louisiana, Mississippi, 
Alabama and Florida on the maps below. The textual unit descriptions 
below are definitive sources for determining the critical habitat 
boundaries. General location maps by unit are provided for general 
guidance purposes only, and not as a definitive source for determining 
critical habitat boundaries.
    (a) Unit 1: Pearl River System in St. Tammany and Washington 
Parishes in Louisiana and Walthall, Hancock, Pearl River, Marion, 
Lawrence, Simpson, Copiah, Hinds, Rankin, and Pike Counties in 
Mississippi.
    (1) Unit 1 includes the Pearl River main stem from the spillway of 
the Ross Barnett Dam, Hinds and Rankin Counties, Mississippi, downstream 
to where the main stem river drainage discharges at its mouth joining 
Lake Borgne, Little Lake, or The Rigolets in Hancock County, 
Mississippi, and St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana. It includes the main 
stems of the East Pearl River, West Pearl River, West Middle River, 
Holmes Bayou, Wilson Slough, downstream to where these main stem river 
drainages discharge at the mouths of Lake Borgne, Little Lake, or The 
Rigolets. Unit 1 also includes the Bogue Chitto River main stem, a 
tributary of the Pearl River, from Mississippi State Highway 570, Pike 
County, Mississippi, downstream to its confluence with the West Pearl 
River, St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana. The lateral extent of Unit 1 is 
the ordinary high water line on each bank of the associated rivers and 
shorelines.

Sec. Table 2 to Part 226--Major Stellar Sea Lion Haulout Sites in Alaska

    Major Steller sea lion haulout sites in Alaska are identified in the 
following table. Where two sets of coordinates are given, the baseline 
extends in a clockwise direction from the first set of geographic 
coordinates along the shoreline at mean lower-low water to the second 
set of coordinates. Where only one set of coordinates is listed, that 
location is the basepoint.

prehearing conference unless the presiding officer otherwise specifies 
in the final agenda.
    (b) If the final agenda presents issues not included in the notice 
of the hearing published pursuant to Sec. 228.4:
    (1) Any person interested in participating at the hearing on such 
issues presented shall notify the Assistant Administrator by certified 
mail of an intent to participate not later than 10 days after 
publication of the final agenda. Such person may present direct 
testimony or cross-examine witnesses only on such issues presented 
unless that person previously notified the Assistant Administrator 
pursuant to Sec. 228.5; and
    (2) Additional written direct testimony concerning such issues may 
be submitted within the time provided in the final agenda. Such direct 
testimony will comply with the requirements of Sec. 228.7.


<R05>
Sec. 228.15  Waiver of right to participate.

    Persons who fail to notify the Assistant Administrator pursuant to 
Sec. Sec. 228.5 and 228.14 shall be deemed to have waived their right

<R05>
Sec. 228.16  Conduct of the hearing.

    (a) The hearing shall be held at the time and place fixed in the 
notice of the hearing, unless the presiding officer changes the time or 
place. If a change occurs, the presiding officer shall publish the 
change in the Federal Register and shall expeditiously notify all 
parties by telephone or by mail: Provided, that if that change in time 
or place of hearing is made less than 5 days before the date previously 
fixed for the hearing, the presiding officer shall also announce, or 
cause to be announced, the change at the time and place previously fixed 
for the hearing.
    (b) The presiding officer shall, at the commencement of the hearing, 
introduce into the record: the notice of hearing as published in the 
Federal Register; all subsequent documents published in the Federal 
Register; the draft Environmental Impact Statement if it is required and 
the comments thereon and agency responses to the comments; and a list of 
all parties.

[[Page 641]]

Direct testimony shall then be received with respect to the matters 
specified in the final agenda in such order as the presiding officer 
shall announce. With respect to direct testimony submitted as rebuttal 
testimony or in response to new issues presented by the prehearing 
conference, the presiding officer shall determine the relevancy of such 
testimony.
    (c) The hearing shall be publicly conducted and reported verbatim by 
an official reporter.
    (d) If a party objects to the admission or rejection of any direct 
testimony or to any other ruling of the presiding officer during the 
hearing, he or she shall state briefly the grounds of such objection, 
whereupon an automatic exception will follow if the objection is 
overruled by the presiding officer. The transcript shall not include 
argument or debate thereon except as ordered by the presiding officer. 
The ruling by the presiding officer on any objection shall be a part of 
the transcript and shall be subject to review at the same time and in 
the same manner as the Assistant Administrator's final decision. Only 
objections made before the presiding officer may subsequently be relied 
upon in the proceedings.
    (e) All motions and requests shall be addressed to, and ruled on by, 
the presiding officer, if made prior to his certification of the 
transcript or by the Assistant Administrator if made thereafter.


<R05>
Sec. 228.17  Direct testimony.

    (a) Only direct testimony submitted by affidavit as provided in 
these regulations and introduced at the hearing by a witness shall be 
considered part of the record. Such direct testimony shall not be read 
into evidence but shall become a part of the record subject to exclusion 
of irrelevant and immaterial parts thereof;
    (b) The witness introducing direct testimony shall:
    (1) State his or her name, address and occupation;
    (2) State qualifications for introducing the direct testimony. If an 
expert, the witness shall briefly state the scientific or technical 
training which qualifies the witness as an expert;
    (3) Identify the direct testimony previously submitted in accordance 
with these regulations; and
    (4) Submit to appropriate cross and direct examination. Cross-
examination shall be by a party whose interests are adverse on the issue 
presented, to the witness', if the witness is a party, or to the 
interests of the party who presented the witness.
    (c) A party shall be deemed to have waived the right to introduce 
direct testimony if such party fails to present a witness to introduce 
the direct testimony.
    (d) Official notice may be taken of such matters as are judicially 
noticed by the courts of the United States: Provided, that parties shall 
be given adequate notice, by the presiding officer, at the hearing, of 
matters so noticed and shall be given adequate opportunity to show that 
such facts are inaccurate or are erroneously noticed.


<R05>
Sec. 228.18  Cross-examination.

    (a) The presiding officer may:
    (1) Require the cross-examiner to outline the intended scope of the 
cross-examination;
    (2) Prohibit parties from cross-examining witnesses unless the 
presiding officer has determined that the cross-examiner has an adverse 
interest on the facts at issue to the party-witness or the party 
presenting the witness. For the purposes of this subsection, the 
Assistant Administrator's or his or her representative's interest shall 
be considered adverse to all parties;
    (3) Limit the number of times any party or parties having a common 
interest may cross-examine an ``adverse'' witness on the same matter; 
and
    (4) Exclude cross-examination questions that are immaterial, 
irrelevant or unduly repetitious.
    (b) Any party shall be given an opportunity to appear, either in 
person or through an authorized counsel or representative, to cross-
examine witnesses. Before cross-examining a witness, the party or 
counsel shall state his or her name, address and occupation. If counsel 
cross-examines the witness, counsel shall state for the record the 
authority to act as counsel. Cross-examiners shall be assumed to be 
familiar with the direct testimony.

[[Page 642]]

    (c) Any party or party's counsel who fails to appear at the hearing 
to cross-examine an ``adverse'' witness shall be deemed to have waived 
the right to cross-examine that witness.
    (d) Scientific, technical or commercial publications may only be 
utilized for the limited purposes of impeaching witnesses under cross-
examination unless previously submitted and introduced in accordance 
with these regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 228.19  Oral and written arguments.

    (a) The presiding officer may, in his or her discretion, provide for 
oral argument at the end of the hearing. Such argument, when permitted, 
may be limited by the presiding officer to the extent necessary for the 
expeditious disposition of the proceeding.
    (b) The presiding officer shall announce at the hearing a reasonable 
period of time within which any interested person may file with the 
presiding officer any written comments on the proposed regulations and 
waiver, including proposed findings and conclusions and written 
arguments or briefs, which are based upon the record and citing where 
practicable the relevant page or pages of the transcript. If a party 
filing a brief desires the presiding officer to reconsider any objection 
made by such party to a ruling of the presiding officer, the party shall 
specifically identify such rulings by reference to the pertinent pages 
of the transcript and shall state their arguments thereon as a part of 
the brief.
    (c) Oral or written arguments shall be limited to issues arising 
from direct testimony on the record.


<R05>
Sec. 228.20  Recommended decision, certification of the transcript 
and submission of comments on the recommended decision.

    (a) Promptly after expiration of the period for receiving written 
briefs, the presiding officer shall make a recommended decision based on 
the record and transmit the decision to the Assistant Administrator. The

<R04>
                      Subpart A_General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 229.1  Purpose and scope.

    (a) The regulations in this part implement sections 101(a)(5)(E) and 
118 of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, as amended (16 U.S.C. 
1371(a)(5)(E) and 1387) that provide for exceptions for the taking of 
marine mammals incidental to certain commercial fishing operations from 
the Act's general moratorium on the taking of marine mammals.
    (b) Section 118 of the Act, rather than sections 103 and 104, 
governs the incidental taking of marine mammals in the course of 
commercial fishing operations by persons using vessels of the United 
States, other than vessels fishing for yellowfin tuna in the eastern 
tropical Pacific Ocean purse seine fishery, and vessels that have valid 
fishing permits issued in accordance with section 204(b) of the Magnuson 
Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1824(b)).
    (c) The regulations of Subpart B also govern the incidental taking 
by commercial fishers of marine mammals from species or stocks 
designated under the Act as depleted on the basis of their listing as 
threatened species or endangered species under the Endangered Species 
Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.).
    (d) The regulations of this part do not apply to the incidental 
taking of California sea otters or to Northwest treaty Indian tribal 
members exercising treaty fishing rights.
    (e) Authorizations under subpart A of this part are exemptions only 
from the taking prohibitions under the Act and not those under the 
Endangered Species Act of 1973. To be exempt from the taking 
prohibitions under the Endangered Species Act, specific authorization 
under subpart B of this part is required.
    (f) Authorizations under this part do not apply to the intentional 
lethal taking of marine mammals in the course of commercial fishing 
operations except as provided for under Sec. Sec. 229.4(k) and 
229.5(f).
    (g) The purposes of the regulations in this part are to:
    (1) Reduce the incidental mortality or serious injury of marine 
mammals

[[Page 644]]

occurring in the course of commercial fishing operations below the 
potential biological removal level for a particular stock, and
    (2) Reduce the incidental mortality or serious injury of marine 
mammals occurring in the course of commercial fishing operations to 
insignificant levels approaching a zero mortality and serious injury 
rate by the statutory deadline of April 30, 2001.

[60 FR 45100, Aug. 30, 1995, as amended at 64 FR 9086, Feb. 24, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 229.2  Definitions.

    In addition to the definitions contained in the Act and Sec. 216.3 
of this chapter, and unless otherwise defined in this chapter, the terms 
in this chapter have the following meaning:
    Act or MMPA means the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, as 
amended (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.).
    American lobster or lobster means Homarus americanus.
    Anchored gillnet means any gillnet gear, including an anchored float 
gillnet, sink gillnet or stab net, that is set anywhere in the water 
column and which is anchored, secured, or weighted to the bottom of the 
sea. Also called a set gillnet.
    Assistant Administrator means the Assistant Administrator for 
Fisheries of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
    Authorization Certificate means a document issued by the Assistant 
Administrator, or designee, under the authority of section 118 of the 
Act that authorizes the incidental, but not intentional, taking of 
marine mammals in Category I or II fisheries.
    Bitter end means the end of a line that detaches from a weak link.
    Bottom portion of the line means, for buoy lines, the portion of the 
line in the water column that is closest to the fishing gear.
    Breaking strength means the highest tensile force which an object 
can withstand before breaking.
    Bridle means the lines connecting a gillnet to an anchor or buoy 
line.
    Buoy line means a line connecting fishing gear in the water to a 
buoy at the surface of the water.
    Category I fishery means a commercial fishery determined by the 
Assistant Administrator to have frequent incidental mortality and 
serious injury of marine mammals. A commercial fishery that frequently 
causes mortality or serious injury of marine mammals is one that is by 
itself responsible for the annual removal of 50 percent or more of any 
stock's potential biological removal level.
    Category II fishery means a commercial fishery determined by the 
Assistant Administrator to have occasional incidental mortality and 
serious injury of marine mammals. A commercial fishery that occasionally 
causes mortality or serious injury of marine mammals is one that, 
collectively with other fisheries, is responsible for the annual removal 
of more than 10 percent of any marine mammal stock's potential 
biological removal level and that is by itself responsible for the 
annual removal of between 1 and 50 percent, exclusive, of any stock's 
potential biological removal level. In the absence of reliable 
information indicating the frequency of incidental mortality and serious 
injury of marine mammals by a commercial fishery, the Assistant 
Administrator will determine whether the incidental serious injury or 
mortality is ``occasional'' by evaluating other factors such as fishing 
techniques, gear used, methods used to deter marine mammals, target 
species, seasons and areas fished, qualitative data from logbooks or 
fisher reports, stranding data, and the species and distribution of 
marine mammals in the area, or at the discretion of the Assistant 
Administrator. Eligible commercial fisheries not specifically identified 
in the list of fisheries are deemed to be Category II fisheries until 
the next list of fisheries is published.
    Category III fishery means a commercial fishery determined by the 
Assistant Administrator to have a remote likelihood of, or no known 
incidental mortality and serious injury of marine mammals. A commercial 
fishery that has a remote likelihood of causing incidental mortality and 
serious injury of marine mammals is one that collectively with other 
fisheries is responsible for the annual removal of:
    (1) Ten percent or less of any marine mammal stock's potential 
biological removal level, or

[[Page 645]]

    (2) More than 10 percent of any marine mammal stock's potential 
biological removal level, yet that fishery by itself is responsible for 
the annual removal of 1 percent or less of that stock's potential 
biological removal level. In the absence of reliable information 
indicating the frequency of incidental mortality and serious injury of 
marine mammals by a commercial fishery, the Assistant Administrator will 
determine whether the incidental serious injury or mortality is 
``remote'' by evaluating other factors such as fishing techniques, gear 
used, methods used to deter marine mammals, target species, seasons and 
areas fished, qualitative data from logbooks or fisher reports, 
stranding data, and the species and distribution of marine mammals in 
the area or at the discretion of the Assistant Administrator.
    Commercial fishing operation means the catching, taking, or 
harvesting of fish from the marine environment (or other areas where 
marine mammals occur) that results in the sale or barter of all or part 
of the fish harvested. The term includes licensed commercial passenger 
fishing vessel (as defined in Sec. 216.3 of this chapter) activities 
and aquaculture activities.
    Depleted species means any species or population that has been 
designated as depleted under the Act and is listed in Sec. 216.15 of 
this chapter or part 18, subpart E of this title, or any endangered or 
threatened species of marine mammal.
    Driftnet, drift gillnet, or drift entanglement gear means a gillnet 
or gillnets that is/are unattached to the ocean bottom and not anchored, 
secured or weighted to the bottom, regardless of whether attached to a 
vessel.
    Fisher or fisherman means the vessel owner or operator, or the owner 
or operator of gear in a nonvessel fishery.
    Fishery has the same meaning as in section 3 of the Magnuson Fishery 
Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1802).
    Fishing or to fish means any commercial fishing operation activity 
that involves:
    (1) The catching, taking, or harvesting of fish;
    (2) The attempted catching, taking, or harvesting of fish;
    (3) Any other activity that can reasonably be expected to result in 
the catching, taking, or harvesting of fish; or
    (4) Any operations at sea in support of, or in preparation for, any 
activity described in paragraphs (1), (2), or (3) of this definition.
    Fishing trip means any time spent away from port actively engaged in 
commercial fishing operations. The end of a fishing trip will be the 
time of a fishing vessel's return to port or the return of a fisher from 
tending gear in a nonvessel fishery.
    Fishing vessel or vessel means any vessel, boat, ship, or other 
craft that is used for, equipped to be used for, or of a type normally 
used for, fishing.
    Float-line means the rope at the top of a gillnet from which the 
mesh portion of the net is hung.
    Gillnet means fishing gear consisting of a wall of webbing (meshes) 
or nets, designed or configured so that the webbing (meshes) or nets are 
placed in the water column, usually held approximately vertically, and 
are designed to capture fish by entanglement, gilling, or wedging. The 
term ``gillnet'' includes gillnets of all types, including but not 
limited to sink gillnets, other anchored gillnets (e.g., anchored float 
gillnets, stab, and set nets), and drift gillnets. Gillnets may or may 
not be attached to a vessel.
    Groundline, with reference to trap/pot gear, means a line connecting 
traps in a trap trawl, and, with reference to gillnet gear, means a line 
connecting a gillnet or gillnet bridle to an anchor or buoy line.
    Incidental means, with respect to an act, a non-intentional or 
accidental act that results from, but is not the purpose of, carrying 
out an otherwise lawful action.
    Injury means a wound or other physical harm. Signs of injury to a 
marine mammal include, but are not limited to, visible blood flow, loss 
of or damage to an appendage or jaw, inability to use one or more 
appendages, asymmetry in the shape of the body or body position, 
noticeable swelling or hemorrhage, laceration, puncture or rupture of 
eyeball, listless appearance or inability to defend itself, inability to 
swim or dive upon release from fishing gear, or signs

[[Page 646]]

of equilibrium imbalance. Any animal that ingests fishing gear, or any 
animal that is released with fishing gear entangling, trailing or 
perforating any part of the body will be considered injured regardless 
of the absence of any wound or other evidence of an injury.
    Insignificance threshold means the upper limit of annual incidental 
mortality and serious injury of marine mammal stocks by commercial 
fisheries that can be considered insignificant levels approaching a zero 
mortality and serious injury rate. An insignificance threshold is 
estimated as 10 percent of the Potential Biological Removal level for a 
stock of marine mammals. If certain parameters (e.g., maximum net 
productivity rate or the recovery factor in the calculation of the 
stock's potential biological removal level) can be estimated or 
otherwise modified from default values, the Assistant Administrator may 
use a modification of the number calculated from the simple formula for 
the insignificance threshold. The Assistant Administrator may also use a 
modification of the simple formula when information is insufficient to 
estimate the level of mortality and serious injury that would have an 
insignificant effect on the affected population stock and provide a 
rationale for using the modification.
    Interaction means coming in contact with fishing gear or catch. An 
interaction may be characterized by a marine mammal entangled, hooked, 
or otherwise trapped in fishing gear, regardless of whether injury or 
mortality occurs, or situations where marine mammals are preying on 
catch. Catch means fish or shellfish that has been hooked, entangled, 
snagged, trapped or otherwise captured by commercial fishing gear.
    Large mesh gillnet means a gillnet constructed with a mesh size of 7 
inches (17.78 cm) to 18 inches (45.72 cm).
    Lead-line means the rope, weighted or otherwise, to which the bottom 
edge of a gillnet is attached.
    List of Fisheries means the most recent final list of commercial 
fisheries published in the Federal Register by the Assistant 
Administrator, categorized according to the likelihood of incidental 
mortality and serious injury of marine mammals during commercial fishing 
operations.
    Mesh size means the distance between inside knot to inside knot. 
Mesh size is measured as described in Sec. 648.80(f)(1) of this title.
    Mid-Atlantic coastal waters means waters bounded by the line defined 
by the following points: The southern shoreline of Long Island, New York 
at 72[deg]30[min]W, then due south to 33[deg]51[min]N lat., thence west 
to the North Carolina/South Carolina border.
    Minimum population estimate means an estimate of the number of 
animals in a stock that:
    (1) Is based on the best available scientific information on 
abundance, incorporating the precision and variability associated with 
such information; and
    (2) Provides reasonable assurance that the stock size is equal to or 
greater than the estimate.
    Mudhole means waters off New Jersey bounded as follows: From the 
point 40[deg]30[min] N. latitude where it intersects with the shoreline 
of New Jersey east to its intersection with 73[deg]20[min] W. longitude, 
then south to its intersection with 40[deg]05[min] N. latitude, then 
west to its intersection with the shoreline of New Jersey.
    Negligible impact has the same meaning as in Sec. 216.103 of this 
chapter.
    Net productivity rate means the annual per capita rate of increase 
in a stock resulting from additions due to reproduction, less losses due 
to mortality.
    Neutrally buoyant line means, for both groundlines and buoy lines, 
line that has a specific gravity greater than or equal to 1.030, and, 
for groundlines only, does not float at any point in the water column 
(See also Sinking line).
    Night means any time between one half hour before sunset and one 
half hour after sunrise.
    NMFS means the National Marine Fisheries Service.
    Nonvessel fishery means a commercial fishing operation that uses 
fixed or other gear without a vessel, such as gear used in set gillnet, 
trap, beach seine, weir, ranch, and pen fisheries.

[[Page 647]]

    Observer means an individual authorized by NMFS, or a designated 
contractor, to record information on marine mammal interactions, fishing 
operations, marine mammal life history information, and other scientific 
data, and collect biological specimens during commercial fishing 
activities.
    Operator, with respect to any vessel, means the master, captain, or 
other individual in charge of that vessel.
    Potential biological removal level means the maximum number of 
animals, not including natural mortalities, that may be removed from a 
marine mammal stock while allowing that stock to reach or maintain its 
optimum sustainable population. The potential biological removal level 
is the product of the following factors:
    (1) The minimum population estimate of the stock;
    (2) One-half the maximum theoretical or estimated net productivity 
rate of the stock at a small population size; and
    (3) A recovery factor of between 0.1 and 1.0.
    Qualified individual means an individual ascertained by NMFS to be 
reasonably able, though training or experience, to identify a right 
whale. Such individuals include, but are not limited to, NMFS staff, 
U.S. Coast Guard and Navy personnel trained in whale identification, 
scientific research survey personnel, whale watch operators and 
naturalists, and mariners trained in whale species identification 
through disentanglement training or some other training program deemed 
adequate by NMFS.
    Regional Fishery Management Council means a regional fishery 
management council established under section 302 of the Magnuson Fishery 
Conservation and Management Act.
    Reliable report means a credible right whale sighting report based 
upon which a DAM zone would be triggered.
    Seine means a net that fishes vertically in the water, is pulled by 
hand or by power, and captures fish by encirclement and confining fish 
within itself or against another net, the shore or bank as a result of 
net design, construction, mesh size, webbing diameter, or method in 
which it is used. In some regions, the net is typically constructed with 
a capture bag in the center of the net which concentrates the fish as 
the net is closed.
    Serious injury means any injury that will likely result in 
mortality.
    Sink gillnet or stab net means any gillnet, anchored or otherwise, 
that is designed to be, or is fished on or near the bottom in the lower 
third of the water column.
    Sinking line means, for both groundlines and buoy lines, line that 
has a specific gravity greater than or equal to 1.030, and, for 
groundlines only, does not float at any point in the water column (See 
also Neutrally buoyant line).
    Small mesh gillnet means a gillnet constructed with a mesh size of 
greater than 5 inches (12.7 cm) to less than 7 inches (17.78 cm).
    Southern Mid-Atlantic waters means all state and Federal waters off 
the States of Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina, bounded 
on the north by a line extending eastward from the northern shoreline of 
Delaware at 38[deg]47[min] N. latitude (the latitude that corresponds 
with Cape Henlopen, DE), east to its intersection with 72[deg]30[min] W. 
longitude, south to the 33[deg]51[min] N. latitude (the latitude that 
corresponds with the North Carolina/South Carolina border), and then 
west to its intersection with the shoreline of the North Carolina/South 
Carolina border.
    Spotter plane means a plane that is deployed for the purpose of 
locating schools of target fish for a fishing vessel that intends to set

Sec. 229.4  Requirements for Category I and II fisheries.

    (a) General. (1) For a vessel owner or crew members to lawfully 
incidentally take marine mammals in the course of a commercial fishing 
operation in a Category I or II fishery, the owner or authorized 
representative of a fishing vessel or nonvessel fishing gear must have 
in possession a valid Certificate of Authorization. The owner of a 
fishing vessel or nonvessel fishing gear is responsible for obtaining a 
Certificate of Authorization.
    (2) The granting and administration of Authorization Certificates 
under this part will be integrated and coordinated with existing fishery 
license, registration, or permit systems and related programs wherever 
possible. These programs may include, but are not limited to, state or 
interjurisdictional fisheries programs. If the administration of 
Authorization Certificates is integrated into a program, NMFS will 
publish a notice in the Federal Register announcing the integrated 
program and summarizing how an owner or authorized representative of a 
fishing vessel or non-fishing gear may register under that program or 
how

[[Page 651]]

registration will be achieved if no action is required on the part of 
the affected fisher. NMFS will make additional efforts to contact 
participants in the affected fishery via other appropriate means of 
notification.
    (b) Registration. (1) The owner of a vessel, or for nonvessel gear 
fisheries, the owner of gear, who participates in a Category I or II 
fishery is required to be registered for a Certificate of Authorization.
    (2) Unless a notice is published in the Federal Register announcing 
an integrated registration program, the owner of a vessel, or for 
nonvessel fishery, the owner of the gear must register for and receive 
an Authorization Certificate. To register, owners must submit the 
following information using the format specified by NMFS:
    (i) Name, address, and phone number of owner.
    (ii) Name, address, and phone number of operator, if different from 
owner, unless the name of the operator is not known or has not been 
established at the time the registration is submitted.
    (iii) For a vessel fishery, vessel name, length, home port; U.S. 
Coast Guard documentation number or state registration number, and if 
applicable; state commercial vessel license number and for a nonvessel 
fishery, a description of the gear and state commercial license number, 
if applicable.
    (iv) A list of all Category I and II fisheries in which the fisher 
may actively engage during the calendar year.
    (v) A certification signed and dated by the owner of an authorized 
representative of the owner as follows: ``I hereby certify that I am the 
owner of the vessel, that I have reviewed all information contained on 
this document, and that it is true and complete to the best of my 
knowledge.''
    (vi) A check or money order made payable to NMFS in the amount 
specified in the notice of the final List of Fisheries must accompany 
each registration submitted to NMFS. The amount of this fee will be 
based on recovering the administrative costs incurred in granting an 
authorization. The Assistant Administrator may waive the fee requirement 
for good cause upon the recommendation of the Regional Director.
    (3) If a notice is published in the Federal Register announcing an 
integrated registration program, the owner of a vessel, or for nonvessel 
fishery, the owner of the gear may register by following the directions 
provided in that notice. If a person receives a registration to which he 
or she is not entitled or if the registration contains incorrect, 
inaccurate or incomplete information, the person shall notify NMFS 
within 10 days following receipt. If a fisher participating in a 
Category I or II fishery who expects to receive automatic registration 
does not receive that registration within the time specified in the 
notice announcing the integrated registration program, the person shall 
notify NMFS as directed in the notice or may apply for registration by 
submitting the information required under paragraph (b)(1)(i) through 
(b)(1)(vi) of this section.
    (c) Address. Unless the granting and administration of 
authorizations under this part 229 is integrated and coordinated with 
existing fishery licenses, registrations, or related programs pursuant 
to paragraph (a) of this section, requests for registration forms and 
completed registration and renewal forms should be sent to the NMFS 
Regional Offices as follows:
    (1) Alaska Region, NMFS, P.O. Box 21668, 709 West 9th Street, 
Juneau, AK 99802; telephone: 907-586-7235;

    (3) If a person receives a renewed Authorization Certificate or a 
decal to which he or she is not entitled, the person shall notify NMFS 
within 10 days following receipt.
    (e) Authorization Certificate and decal requirements. (1) If a decal 
has been issued under the conditions specified in paragraph (e)(2) of 
this section, the decal must be attached to the vessel on the port side 
of the cabin or, in the absence of a cabin, on the forward port side of 
the hull, and must be free of obstruction and in good condition. The 
decal must be attached to the Authorization Certificate for nonvessel 
fisheries.
    (2) The Authorization Certificate, or a copy, must be on board the 
vessel while it is operating in a Category I or II fishery, or, in the 
case of nonvessel fisheries, the Authorization Certificate with decal 
attached, or copy must be in the possession of the person in charge of 
the fishing operation. The Authorization Certificate, or copy, must be 
made available upon request to any state or Federal enforcement agent 
authorized to enforce the Act, any designated agent of NMFS, or any 
contractor providing observer services to NMFS.
    (3) Authorization Certificates and decals are not transferable. In 
the event of the sale or change in ownership of the vessel, the 
Authorization Certificate is void and the new owner must register for an 
Authorization Certificate and decal.
    (4) An Authorization Certificate holder must notify the issuing 
office in writing:

taken must be immediately returned to the sea with a minimum of further 
injury, unless directed otherwise by NMFS personnel, a designated 
contractor or an official observer, or authorized otherwise by a 
scientific research permit that is in the possession of the operator.
    (h) Monitoring. Authorization Certificate holders must comply with 
the observer or other monitoring requirements specified under Sec. 
229.7.
    (i) Deterrence. When necessary to deter a marine mammal from 
damaging fishing gear, catch, or other private property, or from 
endangering personal safety, vessel owners and crew members engaged in a 
Category I or II fishery must comply with all deterrence provisions set 
forth in the Act and all guidelines and prohibitions published 
thereunder.
    (j) Self defense. When imminently necessary in self-defense or to 
save the life of a person in immediate danger, a marine mammal may be 
lethally taken if such taking is reported to NMFS in accordance with the 
requirements of Sec. 229.6.
    (k) Take reduction plans and emergency regulations. Authorization 
Certificate holders must comply with any applicable take reduction plans 
and emergency regulations.
    (l) Expiration. Authorization Certificates expire at the end of each

[60 FR 45100, Aug. 30, 1995, as amended at 64 FR 9087, Feb. 24, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 229.7  Monitoring of incidental mortalities and serious injuries.

    (a) Purpose. The Assistant Administrator will establish a program to 
monitor incidental mortality and serious injury of marine mammals during 
the course of commercial fishing operations in order to:
    (1) Obtain statistically reliable estimates of incidental mortality 
and serious injury;
    (2) Determine the reliability of reports of incidental mortality and 
injury under Sec. 229.6; and
    (3) Identify changes in fishing methods or technology that may 
increase or decrease incidental mortality and serious injury.
    (b) Observer program. Pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, the 
Assistant Administrator may observe Category I and II vessels as 
necessary. Observers may, among other tasks:
    (1) Record incidental mortality and injury, and bycatch of other 
nontarget species;
    (2) Record numbers of marine mammals sighted; and
    (3) Perform other scientific investigations, which may include, but 
are not limited to, sampling and

[[Page 654]]

photographing incidental mortalities and serious injuries.
    (c) Observer requirements for participants in Category I and II 
fisheries. (1) If requested by NMFS or by a designated contractor 
providing observer services to NMFS, a vessel owner/operator must take 
aboard an observer to accompany the vessel on fishing trips.
    (2) After being notified by NMFS, or by a designated contractor 
providing observer services to NMFS, that the vessel is required to 
carry an observer, the vessel owner/operator must comply with the 
notification by providing information requested within the specified 
time on scheduled or anticipated fishing trips.
    (3) NMFS, or a designated contractor providing observer services to 
NMFS, may waive the observer requirement based on a finding that the 
facilities for housing the observer or for carrying out observer 
functions are so inadequate or unsafe that the health or safety of the 
observer or the safe operation of the vessel would be jeopardized.
    (4) The vessel owner/operator and crew must cooperate with the 
observer in the performance of the observer's duties including:
    (i) Providing, at no cost to the observer, the United States 
government, or the designated observer provider, food, toilet, bathing, 
sleeping accommodations, and other amenities that are equivalent to 
those provided to the crew, unless other arrangements are approved in 
advance by the Regional Administrator;
    (ii) Allowing for the embarking and debarking of the observer as 
specified by NMFS personnel or designated contractors. The operator of a 
vessel must ensure that transfers of observers at sea are accomplished 
in a safe manner, via small boat or raft, during daylight hours if 
feasible, as weather and sea conditions allow, and with the agreement of 
the observer involved;
    (iii) Allowing the observer access to all areas of the vessel 
necessary to conduct observer duties;

develop to ensure the effective deployment and use of observers.
    (5) Marine mammals or other specimens identified in paragraph 
(c)(4)(vi) of this section, which are readily accessible to crew 
members, must be brought on board the vessel and retained for the 
purposes of scientific research if feasible and requested by NMFS 
personnel, designated contractors, or the observer. Specimens so 
collected and retained must, upon request by NMFS personnel, designated 
contractors, or the observer, be retained in cold storage on board the 
vessel, if feasible, until removed at the request of NMFS personnel, 
designated contractors, or the observer, retrieved by authorized 
personnel of NMFS, or released by the observer for return to the ocean. 
These biological specimens may be transported on board the vessel during 
the fishing trip and back to port under this authorization.
    (d) Observer requirements for participants in Category III 
fisheries. (1) The Assistant Administrator may place observers on 
Category III vessels if the Assistant Administrator:
    (i) Believes that the incidental mortality and serious injury of 
marine mammals from such fishery may be contributing to the immediate 
and significant adverse impact on a species or stock listed as a 
threatened species or endangered species under the Endangered Species 
Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.); and

[[Page 655]]

    (ii) Has complied with Sec. 229.9(a)(3)(i) and (ii); or
    (iii) Has the consent of the vessel owner.
    (2) If an observer is placed on a Category III vessel, the vessel 
owner and/or operator must comply with the requirements of Sec. 
229.7(c).
    (e) Alternative observer program. The Assistant Administrator may 
establish an alternative observer program to provide statistically 
reliable information on the species and number of marine mammals 
incidentally taken in the course of commercial fishing operations. The 
alternative observer program may include direct observation of fishing 
activities from vessels, airplanes, or points on shore.

Sec. 229.9  Emergency regulations.

    (a) If the Assistant Administrator finds that the incidental 
mortality or serious injury of marine mammals from commercial fisheries 
is having, or is likely to have, an immediate and significant adverse 
impact on a stock or species, the Assistant Administrator will:
    (1) In the case of a stock or species for which a take reduction 
plan is in effect--
    (i) Prescribe emergency regulations that, consistent with such plan 
to the maximum extent practicable, reduce incidental mortality and 
serious injury in that fishery; and
    (ii) Approve and implement on an expedited basis, any amendments to 
such plan that are recommended by the Take Reduction Team to address 
such adverse impact;
    (2) In the case of a stock or species for which a take reduction 
plan is being developed--
    (i) Prescribe emergency regulations to reduce such incidental 
mortality and serious injury in that fishery; and
    (ii) Approve and implement, on an expedited basis, such plan, which 
will provide methods to address such adverse impact if still necessary;
    (3) In the case of a stock or species for which a take reduction 
plan does not exist and is not being developed, or in the case of a 
Category III fishery that the Assistant Administrator believes may be 
contributing to such adverse impact,
    (i) Prescribe emergency regulations to reduce such incidental 
mortality and serious injury in that fishery, to the extent necessary to 
mitigate such adverse impact;
    (ii) Immediately review the stock assessment for such stock or 
species and the classification of such commercial fishery under this 
section to determine if a take reduction team should be established and 
if recategorization of the fishery is warranted; and
    (iii) Where necessary to address such adverse impact on a species or 
stock listed as a threatened species or endangered species under the 
Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), place observers on 
vessels in a Category III fishery if the Assistant Administrator has 
reason to believe such

[[Page 656]]

vessels may be causing the incidental mortality and serious injury to 
marine mammals from such stock.
    (b) Prior to taking any action under Sec. 229.9(a)(1) through (3), 
the Assistant Administrator will consult with the Marine Mammal 
Commission, all appropriate Regional Fishery Management Councils, state 
fishery managers, and the appropriate take reduction team, if 
established.
    (c) Any emergency regulations issued under this section:
    (1) Shall be published in the Federal Register and will remain in 
effect for no more than 180 days or until the end of the applicable 
commercial fishing season, whichever is earlier, except as provided in 
paragraph (d) of this section; and
    (2) May be terminated by notification in the Federal Register at an 
earlier date if the Assistant Administrator determines that the reasons 
for the emergency regulations no longer exist.
    (d) If the Assistant Administrator finds that incidental mortality 
and serious injury of marine mammals in a commercial fishery is 
continuing to have an immediate and significant adverse impact on a 
stock or species, the Assistant Administrator may extend the emergency 
regulations for an additional period of not more than 90 days or until 
reasons for the emergency regulations no longer exist, whichever is 
earlier.

       Subpart B_Takes of Endangered and Threatened Marine Mammals


<R05>
Sec. 229.20  Issuance of permits.

    (a) Determinations. During a period of up to 3 consecutive years, 
NMFS will allow the incidental, but not the intentional, taking by 
persons using vessels of the United States or foreign vessels that have 
valid fishing permits issued by the Assistant Administrator in 
accordance with section 204(b) of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and 
Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1824(b)), while engaging in commercial fishing 
operations, of marine mammals from a species or stock designated as 
depleted because of its listing as an endangered species or threatened 
species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 if the Assistant 
Administrator determines that:
    (1) The incidental mortality and serious injury from commercial 
fisheries will have a negligible impact on such species or stock;
    (2) A recovery plan has been developed or is being developed for 
such species or stock pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973; 
and
    (3) Where required under regulations in subpart A of this part:
    (i) A monitoring program has been established under Sec. 229.7;
    (ii) Vessels engaged in such fisheries are registered in accordance 
with Sec. 229.4; and
    (iii) A take reduction plan has been developed or is being developed 
for such species or stock in accordance with regulations at subpart C of 
this part.
    (b) Procedures for making determinations. In making any of the 
determinations listed in paragraph (a) of this section, the Assistant 
Administrator will

[[Page 658]]

publish an announcement in the Federal Register of fisheries having 
takes of marine mammals listed under the Endangered Species Act, 
including a summary of available information regarding the fisheries 
interactions with listed species. Any interested party may, within 45 
days of such publication, submit to the Assistant Administrator written 
data or views with respect to the listed fisheries. As soon as 
practicable after the end of the 45 days following publication, NMFS 
will publish in the Federal Register a list of the fisheries for which 
the determinations listed in paragraph (a) of this section have been 
made. This publication will set forth a summary of the information used 
to make the determinations.
    (c) Issuance of authorization. The Assistant Administrator will 
issue appropriate permits for vessels in fisheries that are required to 
register under Sec. 229.4 and for which determinations under the 
procedures of paragraph (b) of this section can be made.
    (d) Category III fisheries. Vessel owners engaged only in Category 
III fisheries for which determinations are made under the procedures of 
paragraph (b) of this section will not be subject to the penalties of 
this Act for the incidental taking of marine mammals to which this 
subpart applies, as long as the vessel owner or operator of such vessel 
reports any incidental mortality or injury of such marine mammals in 
accordance with the requirements of Sec. 229.6.
    (e) Emergency authority. During the course of the commercial fishing 
season, if the Assistant Administrator determines that the level of 
incidental mortality or serious injury from commercial fisheries for 
which such a determination was made under this section has resulted or 
is likely to result in an impact that is more than negligible on the 
endangered or threatened species or stock, the Assistant Administrator 
will use the emergency authority of Sec. 229.9 to protect such species 
or stock, and may modify any permit granted under this paragraph as 
necessary.
    (f) Suspension, revocation, modification and amendment. The 
Assistant Administrator may, pursuant to the provisions of 15 CFR part 
904, suspend or revoke a permit granted under this section if the

Sec. 229.31  Pacific Offshore Cetacean Take Reduction Plan.

    (a) Purpose and scope. The purpose of this section is to implement 
the Pacific Offshore Cetacean Take Reduction Plan. Paragraphs (b) 
through (d) of this section apply to all U.S. drift gillnet fishing 
vessels operating in waters seaward of the coast of California or 
Oregon, including adjacent high seas waters. For purposes of this 
section, the fishing season is defined as beginning May 1 and ending on 
January 31 of the following year.
    (b) Extenders. An extender is a line that attaches a buoy (float) to 
a drift gillnet's floatline. The floatline is attached to the top of the 
drift gillnet. All extenders (buoy lines) must be at least 6 fathoms (36 
ft; 10.9 m) in length during all sets. Accordingly, all floatlines must 
be fished at a minimum

[[Page 659]]

of 36 feet (10.9 m) below the surface of the water.
    (c) Pingers. (1) For the purposes of this paragraph (c), a pinger is 
an acoustic deterrent device which, when immersed in water, broadcasts a 
10 kHz (<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2 kHz) sound at 132 dB (<plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>4 dB) re 1 micropascal at 1 m, lasting 300 milliseconds 
(+15 milliseconds), and repeating every 4 seconds (+ .2 seconds); and 
remains operational to a water depth of at least 100 fathoms (600 ft or 
182.88 m).
    (2) While at sea, operators of drift gillnet vessels with gillnets 
onboard must carry enough pingers on the vessel to meet the requirements 
set forth under paragraphs (c)(3) through(6) of this section.
    (3) Floatline. Pingers shall be attached within 30 ft (9.14 m) of 
the floatline and spaced no more than 300 ft (91.44 m) apart.
    (4) Leadline. Pingers shall be attached within 36 ft (10.97 m) of 
the leadline and spaced no more than 300 ft (91.44 m) apart.
    (5) Staggered Configuration. Pingers attached within 30 ft (9.14 m) 
of the floatline and within 36 ft (10.97 m) of the leadline shall be 
staggered such that the horizontal distance between them is no more than 
150 ft (45.5 m).
    (6) Any materials used to weight pingers must not change its 
specifications set forth under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (7) The pingers must be operational and functioning at all times 
during deployment.
    (8) If requested, NMFS may authorize the use of pingers with 
specifications or pinger configurations differing from those set forth 
in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(3) of this section for limited, 
experimental purposes within a single fishing season.
    (d) Skipper education workshops. After notification from NMFS, 
vessel operators must attend a skipper education workshop before 
commencing fishing each fishing season. For the 1997/1998 fishing 
season, all vessel operators must have attended one skipper education 
workshop by October 30, 1997. NMFS may waive the requirement to attend 
these workshops by notice to all vessel operators.

Sec. 229.32  Atlantic large whale take reduction plan regulations.

    (a)(1) Purpose and scope. The purpose of this section is to 
implement the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan to reduce 
incidental mortality and serious injury of fin, humpback, and right 
whales in specific Category I and Category II commercial fisheries from 
Maine through Florida. The measures identified in the Atlantic Large 
Whale Take Reduction Plan are also intended to benefit minke whales, 
which are not designated as a strategic stock, but are known to be taken 
incidentally in gillnet and trap/pot fisheries. The gear types affected 
by this plan include gillnets (e.g., anchored, drift, and shark) and 
traps/pots.
    (2) Regulated waters. The regulations in this section apply to all 
U.S. waters in the Atlantic except for the areas exempted in paragraph 
(a)(3) of this section.
    (3) Exempted waters. (i) The regulations in this section do not 
apply to waters landward of the first bridge over any embayment, harbor, 
or inlet in Massachusetts.
    (ii) The regulations in this section do not apply to waters landward 
of the 72 COLREGS demarcation lines (International Regulations for 
Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972), as depicted or noted on nautical 
charts published by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration

requirements listed here.\1\ The Assistant Administrator may revise 
these requirements in accordance with paragraph (i) of this section.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Fishermen are also encouraged to maintain their buoy lines to be 
as knot-free as possible. Splices are considered to be less of an 
entanglement threat and are thus preferable to knots.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (i) No buoy line floating at the surface. No person or vessel may 
fish with trap/pot gear that has any portion of the buoy line floating 
at the surface at any time when the buoy line is directly connected to 
the gear at the ocean bottom. If more than one buoy is attached to a 
single buoy line or if a high flyer and a buoy are used together on a 
single buoy line, floating line may be used between these objects.

line), such as surface buoys, high flyers, sub-surface buoys, toggles, 
window weights, etc., must be attached to the buoy line with a weak link 
placed as close to each individual buoy, flotation device and/or weight 
as operationally feasible and that meets the following specifications:
    (1) The weak link must be chosen from the following list approved by 
NMFS: Swivels, plastic weak links, rope of appropriate breaking 
strength, hog rings, rope stapled to a buoy stick, or other materials or 
devices approved in writing by the Assistant Administrator. A brochure 
illustrating the techniques for making weak links is available from the 
Regional Administrator, NMFS, Northeast Region upon request.
    (2) The breaking strength of the weak links must not exceed 1,100 lb 
(499.0 kg).
    (3) Weak links must break cleanly leaving behind the bitter end of 
the line. The bitter end of the line must be free of any knots when the 
weak link breaks. Splices are not considered to be knots for the 
purposes of this provision.
    (B) Net panel weak links. The breaking strength of each weak link 
must not exceed 1,100 lb (499.0 kg). The weak link requirements apply to 
all variations in panel size. All net panels in a string must contain 
weak links that meet one of the following two configurations:
    (1) Configuration 1. (i) The weak link must be chosen from the 
following list approved by NMFS: Plastic weak links or rope of 
appropriate breaking strength. If rope of appropriate breaking strength 
is used throughout the floatline or as the up and down line, or if no up 
and down line is present, then individual weak links are not required on 
the floatline or up and down line. A brochure illustrating the 
techniques for making weak links is available from the Regional 
Administrator, NMFS, Northeast Region upon request; and
    (ii) One weak link must be placed in the center of each of the up 
and down lines at both ends of the net panel; and
    (iii) One weak link must be placed as close as possible to each end 
of the net panels on the floatline; and
    (iv) For net panels of 50 fathoms (300 ft or 91.4 m) or less in 
length, one weak link must be placed in the center of the floatline; or
    (v) For net panels greater than 50 fathoms (300 ft or 91.4 m) in 
length, one weak link must be placed at least every 25 fathoms (150 ft 
or 45.7 m) along the floatline.
    (2) Configuration 2. (i) The weak link must be chosen from the 
following list approved by NMFS: Plastic weak links or rope of 
appropriate breaking strength. If rope of appropriate breaking strength 
is used throughout the floatline or as the up and down line, or if no up 
and down line is present, then individual weak links are not required on 
the floatline or up and down line. A brochure illustrating the 
techniques for making weak links is available from the Regional 
Administrator, NMFS, Northeast Region upon request; and
    (ii) One weak link must be placed in the center of each of the up 
and down lines at both ends of the net panel; and
    (iii) One weak link must be placed between the floatline tie loops 
between net panels; and
    (iv) One weak link must be placed where the floatline tie loops 
attaches to the bridle, buoy line, or groundline at the end of a net 
string; and
    (v) For net panels of 50 fathoms (300 ft or 91.4 m) or less in 
length, one weak link must be placed in the center of the floatline; or
    (vi) For net panels greater than 50 fathoms (300 ft or 91.4 m) in 
length, one weak link must be placed at least

[[Page 673]]

every 25 fathoms (150 ft or 45.7 m) along the floatline.
    (C) Anchoring systems. All anchored gillnets, regardless of the

in accordance with paragraph (i) of this section.
    (4) [Reserved]
    (h) Restrictions applicable to the Southeast U.S. Monitoring Area--
(1) Area. The Southeast U.S. Monitoring Area consists of the area from 
27[deg]51[min] N. lat. (near Sebastian Inlet, FL) south to 
26[deg]46.50[min] N. lat. (near West Palm Beach, FL), extending from the 
shoreline or exemption line out to 80[deg]00[min] W. long., unless the 
Assistant Administrator changes that area in accordance with paragraph 
(i) of this section.
    (2) Restrictions for Southeastern U.S. Atlantic shark gillnet 
fishery. No person or vessel may fish with or possess gillnet gear for 
shark with webbing of 5 inches (12.7 cm) or greater stretched mesh in 
the Southeast U.S. Monitoring Area from December 1 through March 31 
unless that gear complies with the gear marking requirements specified 
in paragraph (b) of this section, or unless the gear is stowed as 
specified in Sec. 229.2, and the person or vessel satisfies the vessel 
monitoring system and observer requirements listed below. The Assistant 
Administrator may revise these requirements in accordance with paragraph 
(i) of this section.

[[Page 680]]

    (i) Vessel monitoring systems. No person or vessel may fish with or 
possess gillnet gear for shark with webbing of 5 inches (12.7 cm) or 
greater stretched mesh in the Southeast U.S. Monitoring Area during the 
restricted period unless the operator of the vessel is in compliance 
with the vessel monitoring system (VMS) requirements found in 50 CFR 
635.69.
    (ii) At-sea observer coverage. When selected, vessels are required 
to take observers on a mandatory basis in compliance with the 
requirements for at-sea observer coverage found in 50 CFR 229.7. Any 
vessel that fails to carry an observer once selected is prohibited from 
fishing pursuant to 50 CFR part 635.
    (iii) [Reserved]
    (i) Other provisions. In addition to any other emergency authority 
under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the Endangered Species Act, the 
Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, or other 
appropriate authority, the Assistant Administrator may take action under 
this section in the following situations:
    (1) Entanglements in critical habitat or restricted areas. If a 
serious injury or mortality of a right whale occurs in the Cape Cod Bay 
Restricted Area from January 1 through May 15, in the Great South 
Channel Restricted Area from April 1 through June 30, the Southeast U.S. 
Restricted Area N from November 15 to April 15, or the Southeast U.S. 
Restricted Area S from December 1 through March 31 as the result of an 
entanglement by trap/pot or gillnet gear allowed to be used in those 
areas and times, the Assistant Administrator shall close that area to 
that gear type (i.e., trap/pot or gillnet) for the rest of that time 
period and for that same time period in each subsequent year, unless the 
Assistant Administrator revises the restricted period in accordance with 
paragraph (i)(2) of this section or unless other measures are 
implemented under paragraph (i)(2) of this section.
    (2) Other special measures. The Assistant Administrator may revise 
the requirements of this section through a publication in the Federal 
Register if:
    (i) NMFS verifies that certain gear characteristics are both 
operationally effective and reduce serious injuries and mortalities of 
endangered whales;
    (ii) New gear technology is developed and determined to be 
appropriate;
    (iii) Revised breaking strengths are determined to be appropriate;
    (iv) New marking systems are developed and determined to be 
appropriate;
    (v) NMFS determines that right whales are remaining longer than 
expected in a closed area or have left earlier than expected;
    (vi) NMFS determines that the boundaries of a closed area are not 
appropriate;
    (vii) Gear testing operations are considered appropriate; or
    (viii) Similar situations occur.
    (3) Seasonal Area Management (SAM) Program. Until October 6, 2008, 
in addition to existing requirements for vessels deploying anchored 
gillnet or trap/pot gear in the Other Northeast Gillnet Waters, Northern 
Inshore State Trap/Pot Waters, Trap/Pot Waters, Offshore Trap/Pot 
Waters, Great South Channel Restricted Gillnet Area (July 1 through July 
31), Great South Channel Sliver Restricted Area (May 1 through July 31), 
Great South Channel Restricted Trap/Pot Area (July 1 through July 31), 
and Stellwagen Bank/Jeffreys Ledge Restricted Area (anchored gillnet and 
trap/pot area) found at Sec. 229.32 (b)-(d), a vessel may fish in the 
SAM Areas as described in paragraphs (i)(3)(i)(A) and (i)(3)(ii)(A) of 
this section, which overlay the previously mentioned areas, provided the 
gear or vessel complies with the requirements specified in paragraphs 
(i)(3)(i)(B) and (i)(3)(ii)(B) of this section during the times 
specified in those paragraphs. These requirements are in addition to 
requirements found in Sec. 229.32 (b)-(d). The requirements in 
(i)(3)(i)(B) and (i)(3)(ii)(B) of this section supercede requirements 
found at Sec. 229.32 (b)-(d) when the former are more restrictive than 
the latter. For example, the closures applicable to trap/pot and gillnet 
gear in the Great South Channel found in paragraphs (c)(3)(ii) and 
(d)(3)(ii) of this section are more restrictive than the gear 
modifications described in this section and, therefore, supercede them.

    (B) Gear or vessel requirements. Unless otherwise authorized by the 
Assistant Administrator, in accordance with paragraph (i)(2) of this 
section, from March 1 through April 30, no person or vessel may fish 
with or possess anchored gillnet or trap/pot gear in SAM West unless 
that gear complies with the following gear modifications, or unless the 
gear is stowed as specified in Sec. 229.2.
    (1) Anchored gillnet gear--(i) Groundlines. All groundlines must be 
made entirely of sinking and/or neutrally buoyant line. Floating 
groundlines are prohibited. The attachment of buoys, toggles, or other 
floatation devices to groundlines is prohibited.
    (ii) Buoy lines. All buoy lines must be composed of sinking line 
except the bottom portion of the line, which may be a section of 
floating line not to exceed one-third the overall length of the buoy 
line.
    (iii) Buoy line weak links. All buoys, flotation devices and/or 
weights (except gillnets, anchors, and leadline woven into the buoy 
line), such as surface buoys, high flyers, sub-surface buoys, toggles, 
window weights, etc., must be attached to the buoy line with a weak link 
placed as close to each individual buoy, flotation device and/or weight 
as operationally feasible that has a maximum breaking strength of 1,100 
lb (499.0 kg). The weak link must be chosen from the following list 
approved by NMFS: Swivels, plastic weak links, rope of appropriate 
breaking strength, hog rings, rope stapled to a buoy stick, or other 
materials or devices approved in writing by the Assistant Administrator. 
Weak links must break cleanly leaving behind the bitter end of the line. 
The bitter end of the line must be free of any knots when the weak link 
breaks. Splices are not considered to be knots for the purposes of this 
provision. A brochure illustrating the techniques for making weak links 
is available from the Regional Administrator, NMFS, Northeast Region 
upon request.
    (iv) Net panel weak links. The breaking strength of each weak link 
must not exceed 1,100 lb (499.0 kg). The weak link requirements apply to 
all variations in panel size. All net panels in a string must contain 
weak links that meet one of the following two configuration 
specifications found in paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(B)(1) or (d)(6)(ii)(B)(2) 
of this section.
    (v) Anchoring systems. All anchored gillnets, regardless of the 
number of net panels, must be secured at each end of the net string with 
a burying anchor (an anchor that holds to the ocean bottom through the 
use of a fluke, spade, plow, or pick) having the holding capacity equal 
to or greater than a 22-lb (10.0-kg) Danforth-style anchor. Dead weights 
do not meet this requirement. A brochure illustrating the techniques for 
rigging anchoring systems is available from the Regional Administrator, 
NMFS, Northeast Region upon request.
    (2) Trap/pot gear--(i) Groundlines. All groundlines must be made 
entirely of sinking and/or neutrally buoyant line. Floating groundlines 
are prohibited. The attachment of buoys, toggles, or other floatation 
devices to groundlines is prohibited.
    (ii) Buoy lines. All buoy lines must be composed of sinking line 
except the bottom portion of the line, which may be a section of 
floating line not to exceed one-third the overall length of the buoy 
line.
    (iii) Northern Inshore State Trap/Pot Waters, Northern Nearshore 
Trap/Pot Waters Areas, Stellwagen Bank/Jeffreys Ledge Restricted Area, 
and Great South Channel Restricted Trap/Pot Area (that overlaps with LMA 
2 and Outer Cape LMA only) buoy line weak links. All buoys, flotation 
devices, and/or weights (except traps/pots, anchors, and

[[Page 682]]

leadline woven into the buoy line), such as surface buoys, high flyers, 
sub-surface buoys, toggles, window weights, etc., must be attached to 
the buoy line with a weak link placed as close to each individual buoy, 
flotation device, and/or weight as operationally feasible that has a 
maximum breaking strength of up to 600 lb (272.2 kg). The weak link must 
be chosen from the following list approved by NMFS: Swivels, plastic 
weak links, rope of appropriate breaking strength, hog rings, rope 
stapled to a buoy stick, or other materials or devices approved in 
writing by the Assistant Administrator. Weak links must break cleanly 
leaving behind the bitter end of the line. The bitter end of the line 
must be free of any knots when the weak link breaks. Splices are not 
considered to be knots for the purposes of this provision. A brochure 
illustrating the techniques for making weak links is available from the 
Regional Administrator, NMFS, Northeast Region upon request.
    (iv) Offshore Trap/Pot Waters Area and Great South Channel 
Restricted Trap/Pot Area (that overlaps with LMA 2/3 Overlap and LMA 3 
only) buoy line weak links. All buoys, flotation devices, and/or weights 
(except traps/pots, anchors, and leadline woven into the buoy line), 
such as surface buoys, high flyers, sub-surface buoys, toggles, window 
weights, etc., must be attached to the buoy line with a weak link placed 
as close to each individual buoy, flotation device, and/or weight as 
operationally feasible that has a maximum breaking strength of up to 
1,500 lb (680.4 kg). The weak link must be chosen from the following 
list approved by NMFS: swivels, plastic weak links, rope of appropriate 
breaking strength, hog rings, rope stapled to a buoy stick, or other 
materials or devices approved in writing by the Assistant Administrator. 
Weak links must break cleanly leaving behind the bitter end of the line. 
The bitter end of the line must be free of any knots when the weak link 
breaks. Splices are not considered to be knots for the purposes of this 
provision. A brochure illustrating the techniques for making weak links 
is available from the Regional Administrator, NMFS, Northeast Region 
upon request.

    (b) Pingers--(1) Pinger specifications. For the purposes of this 
subpart, a pinger is an acoustic deterrent device which, when immersed 
in water, broadcasts a 10 kHz (<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2 kHz) sound at 132 
dB (<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>4 dB) re 1 micropascal at 1 m, lasting 300 
milliseconds (<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>15 milliseconds), and repeating 
every 4 seconds (<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>.2 seconds).
    (2) Pinger attachment. An operating and functional pinger must be 
attached at the end of each string of the gillnets and at the bridle of 
every net within a string of nets.
    (c) Pinger training and certification. Beginning on January 1, 1999, 
the operator of a vessel may not fish with, set or haul back sink 
gillnets or gillnet gear, or allow such gear to be in closed areas where 
pingers are required as specified under paragraph (b) of this section, 
unless the operator has satisfactorily completed the pinger 
certification training program and possesses on board the vessel a valid 
pinger training certificate issued by NMFS. Notice will be given 
announcing the times and locations of pinger certification training 
programs.
    (d) Use of pingers in closed areas--(1) Vessels, subject to the 
restrictions and regulations specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section, may fish in the Mid-coast Closure Area from September 15 
through May 31 of each fishing year, provided that pingers are used in 
accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this 
section.
    (2) Vessels, subject to the restrictions and regulations specified 
in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, may fish in the Massachusetts Bay 
Closure Area from December 1 through the last day of February and from 
April 1 through May 31 of each fishing year, provided that pingers are 
used in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) 
of this section.
    (3) Vessels, subject to the restrictions and regulations specified 
in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, may fish in the Cape Cod South 
Closure Area from December 1 through the last day of February and from 
April 1 through May 31 of each fishing year, provided that pingers are 
used in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) 
of this section.
    (4) Vessels, subject to the restrictions and regulations specified 
in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, may fish in the Offshore Closure 
Area from November 1 through May 31 of each fishing year, with the 
exception of the Cashes Ledge Closure Area. From February 1 through the 
end of February, the area within the Offshore Closure Area defined as 
``Cashes Ledge'' is closed to all fishing with sink gillnets. Vessels 
subject to the restrictions and regulation specified in paragraph (a)(5) 
of this section may fish in the Offshore Closure Area outside the Cashes 
Ledge Area from February 1 through the end of February provided that 
pingers are used in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (b) 
(1) and (2) of this section.
    (e) Other special measures. The Assistant Administrator may revise 
the requirements of this section through notification published in the 
Federal Register if:
    (1) After plan implementation, NMFS determines that pinger operating 
effectiveness in the commercial fishery is inadequate to reduce bycatch 
to the PBR level with the current plan.

[[Page 686]]

    (2) NMFS determines that the boundary or timing of a closed area is 
inappropriate, or that gear modifications (including pingers) are not 
reducing bycatch to below the PBR level.

management of interjurisdictional fishery resources identified in 
interstate or Federal fishery management plans; and
    (2) To promote and encourage management of interjurisdictional 
fishery resources throughout their range.
    (3) The scope of this part includes guidance on making financial 
assistance awards to States or Interstate Commissions to undertake 
projects in support of management of interjurisdictional fishery 
resources in both the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and State waters,

vessel whose previous construction cost has already been financed (or 
otherwise paid). Refinancing this project cost for a vessel that already 
exists is not inconsistent with wise use, but financing it may be.
    (2) Vessel refurbishing that materially increases an existing 
vessel's harvesting capacity. The Program will not finance this project 
cost. The Program will only refinance this project cost for a vessel 
whose previous refurbishing cost has already been financed (or otherwise 
paid). Refinancing this project cost is not inconsistent with wise use, 
but financing it may be.
    (3) Purchasing a used vessel or used fishery facility. The Program 
will neither finance nor refinance this project cost (except for a used 
vessel or fishery facility that the Program purchased and is reselling), 
unless the used vessel or fishery facility will be refurbished in the 
United States and will be a contributory project or it will be used in 
an underutilized fishery.
    (b) Every project, other than those specified in paragraphs (a) (1) 
and (2) of this section, is consistent with wise use and every project, 
other than those specifically precluded in paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of 
this section, may be financed, as well as refinanced.


<R05>
Sec. 253.12  Guaranteed note, U.S. note, and security documents.

    (a) Guaranteed note--(1) Principal. This may not exceed 80 percent 
of actual cost, but may, in the Division's credit judgment, be less.
    (2) Maturity. This may not exceed 25 years, but shall not exceed the 
project property's useful life and may, in the Division's credit 
judgment, be less.
    (3) Interest rate. This may not exceed the amount the Division deems 
reasonable.
    (4) Prepayment penalty. The Division will allow a reasonable 
prepayment penalty, but the guarantor will not guarantee a notemaker's 
payment of it.
    (5) Form. This will be the simple promissory note (with the 
guarantee attached) the Division prescribes, promising only to pay 
principal, interest, and prepayment penalty.
    (6) Sole security. The guaranteed note and the guarantee will be the 
noteholder's sole security.
    (b) U.S. note and security documents--(1) Form. The U.S. note and 
security documents will be in the form the Division prescribes.
    (2) U.S. note. This exists to evidence the notemaker's actual and 
contingent liability to the guarantor (contingent if the guarantor does 
not pay the guaranteed note (including any portion of it), on the 
notemaker's behalf or if the guarantor does not advance any other 
amounts or incur any other expenses on the notemaker's behalf to protect 
the U.S. or accommodate the notemaker; actual if, and to the same 
monetary extent that, the guarantor does). Payment of the guaranteed 
note

[[Page 698]]

by anyone but the guarantor will amortize the original principal balance 
(and interest accruing on it) of the U.S. note to the same extent that 
it amortizes the guaranteed note. The U.S note will, among other things, 
contain provisions for adding to its principal balance all amounts the 
Program advances, or expenses it incurs, to protect the U.S. or 
accommodate the notemaker.
    (3) Security documents. The Division will, at a minimum, require a 
pledge of all project property (or adequate substitute collateral). The 
Division will require such other security as it deems the circumstances 
of each notemaker and project require to protect the U.S. All security 
documents will secure the U.S. note. The security documents will, among 
other things, contain provisions for adding to the U.S. note all Program 
advances, expenditures, and expenses required to protect the U.S. or 
accommodate the notemaker.
    (4) Recourse. Significant Program reliance, as a secondary means of 
repayment, on the net worths of parties other than the notemaker will 
ordinarily require secured recourse against those net worths. Recourse 
may be by a repayment guarantee or irrevocable letter of credit. 
Ordinarily, the Division will require recourse against: All major 
shareholders of a closely-held corporate notemaker, the parent 
corporation of a subsidiary corporate notemaker without substantial 
pledged assets other than the project property, and all major limited 
partners. The Division may also require recourse against others it deems 
necessary to protect the U.S. The principal parties in interest, who 
ultimately stand most to benefit from the project, should ordinarily be 
held financially accountable for the project's performance. Where 
otherwise appropriate recourse is unavailable, the conservatively 
projected net liquidating value of the notemaker's assets pledged to the 
Program must, in the Division's credit judgment, substantially exceed 
all projected Program exposure.
    (c) Dual-use CCF. For a vessel, the Division may require annually 
depositing some portion of the project property's net income into a 
dual-use CCF. A dual-use CCF provides the normal CCF tax-deferral 
benefits, but also both gives the Program control of CCF withdrawals and 
recourse against CCF deposits and ensures an emergency refurbishing 
reserve (tax-deferred) for project property.


<R05>
Sec. 253.13  Ability and experience requirements.

    A notemaker and the majority of its principals must generally have 
the ability, experience, resources, character, reputation, and other 
qualifications the Division deems necessary for successfully operating 
the project property and protecting the U.S. The Program will ordinarily 
not provide guarantees: For venture capital purposes; to a notemaker 
whose principals are all from outside the industry; or for a notemaker 
the majority of whose principals cannot document successful industry 
ability and experience of a duration, degree, and nature consistent with 
protecting the U.S.


<R05>
Sec. 253.14  Economic and financial requirements.

    (a) Income and expense projections. The Division's conservative 
income and expense projections for the project property's operation must 
prospectively indicate net earnings that can service all debt, properly 
maintain the project property, and protect the U.S. against the 
industry's cyclical economics and other risks of loss.
    (b) Working capital. The Division's conservative assessment of an 
applicant's financial condition must indicate initial working capital 
prospectively sufficient to provide for the project property to achieve 
net earnings projections, fund all foreseeable contingencies, and 
protect the U.S. At the Division's discretion, some portion of projected 
working capital needs may be met by something other than current assets 
minus current liabilities (i.e., by a line or letter of credit, 
noncurrent assets readily capable of generating working capital, a 
guarantor with sufficient financial resources, etc.).
    (c) Audited financial statements. These will ordinarily be required 
for any notemaker with large or financially extensive operations whose 
financial condition the Division believes it cannot

[[Page 699]]

otherwise assess with reasonable certainty.
    (d) Consultant services. Infrequently, expert consulting services 
may be necessary to help the Division assess a project's economic, 
technical, or financial feasibility. The Division will select and employ 
the necessary consultant, but require the applicant to reimburse the 
Division. A subsequently approved application will not be closed until 
the applicant reimburses the Division. This cost may, at the Division's 
discretion, be included in a guaranteed note's amount. For a declined 
application, the Division may reimburse itself from the remaining 25 
percent of the application fee.


<R05>
Sec. 253.15  Miscellaneous.

    (a) Applicant. Only the legal title holder of project property (or 
the lessee of an appropriate long-term financing lease) may apply for a 
guarantee. Applicants must submit an ``Application for Fisheries 
Obligation Program Guarantee'' to the appropriate NMFS Regional 
Financial Services Branch to be considered for a guaranteed loan.
    (b) Investigation and approval. The Division shall do a due 
diligence investigation of every application it accepts and determine 
if, in the Division's sole judgment, the application is eligible and 
qualified. Applications the Division deems ineligible or unqualified 
will be declined. The Division will approve eligible and qualified 
applications based on the applicability of the information obtained 
during the application and investigation process to the programmatic 
goals and financial requirements of the program and under terms and 
conditions that, in the Division's sole discretion, protect the U.S. The 
Division will state these terms and conditions in its approval in 
principal letter.
    (c) Insurance. All property and other risks shall be continuously 
insured during the term of the U.S. note. Insurers must be acceptable to 
the Division. Insurance must be in such forms and amounts and against 
such risks as the Division deems necessary to protect the U.S. Insurance 
must be endorsed to include the requirements the U.S., as respects its 
interest only, deems necessary to protect the U.S. (e.g., the Program 
will ordinarily be an additional insured as well as the sole loss payee 
for the amount of its interest; cancellation will require 20 days' 
advance written notice; vessel seaworthiness will be admitted, and the 
Program will be adequately protected against other insureds' breaches of 
policy warranties, negligence, omission, etc.)
    (d) Property inspections. The Division will require adequate 
condition and valuation inspection of all property as the basis for 
assessing the property's worth and suitability for guarantee. The 
Division may also require these at specified periods during guarantee 
life. These must be conducted by competent and impartial inspectors 
acceptable to the Division. Inspection cost will be at an applicant's 
expense. Those occurring before application approval may be included in 
actual cost.
    (e) Guarantee terms and conditions. The Division's approval in 
principle letter shall specify the terms and conditions of the 
guarantor's willingness to guarantee. These shall be incorporated in 
closing documents that the Division prepares. Terms and conditions are 
at the Division's sole discretion. An applicant's nonacceptance will 
result in disqualification for guarantee.
    (f) Noteholder. The Division will, as a gratuitous service, request 
parties interested in investing in guaranteed notes to submit offers to 
fund each prospective guaranteed note. The Division and the applicant 
will, by mutual consent, choose the responsive bidder, which ordinarily 
will be the prospective noteholder whose bid represents the lowest net 
effective annual cost of capital. Until the Division has closed the 
guarantee, arrangements between an applicant and a prospective 
noteholder are a matter of private contract between them, and the 
Program is not responsible to either for nonperformance by the other.
    (g) Closing--(1) Approval in principle letters. Every closing will 
be in strict accordance with a final approval in principle letter.
    (2) Contracts. The guaranteed note, U.S. note, and security 
documents will ordinarily be on standard Program forms that may not be 
altered without Divisional approval. The Division will

[[Page 700]]

ordinarily prepare all contracts, except certain pledges involving real 
property, which will be prepared by each notemaker's attorney at the 
direction and approval of the Division's attorney.
    (3) Closing schedules. The Division will ordinarily close guarantee 
transactions with minimal services from applicants' attorneys, except 
where real property pledges or other matters appropriate for private 
counsel are involved. Real property services required from an 
applicant's attorney may include: Title search, mortgage and other 
document preparation, execution and recording, escrow and disbursement, 
and a legal opinion and other assurances. An applicant's attorney's 
expense, and that of any other private contractor required, is for 
applicant's account. Attorneys and other contractors must be 
satisfactory to the Division. The Division will attempt to meet 
reasonable closing schedules, but will not be liable for adverse 
interest-rate fluctuations, loss of commitments, or other consequences 
of being unable to meet an applicant's and a prospective noteholder's 
closing schedule. These parties should work closely with the Division to 
ensure a closing schedule the Division can meet.


<R05>
Sec. 253.16  Fees.

    (a) Application fee. The Division will not accept an application 
without the application fee. Fifty percent of the application fee is 
fully earned at application acceptance, and is not refundable. The rest 
is fully earned when the Division issues an approval in principal 
letter, and it is refundable only if the Division declines an 
application or an applicant requests refund before the Division issues 
an approval in principal letter.
    (b) Guarantee fee. Each guarantee fee will be due in advance and 
will be based on the guaranteed note's repayment provisions for the 
prospective year. The first annual guarantee fee is due at guarantee 
closing. Each subsequent one is due and payable on the guarantee 
closing's anniversary date. Each is fully earned when due, and shall not 
subsequently be refunded for any reason.
    (c) Refinancing or assumption fee. This fee applies only to 
refinancing or assuming existing guaranteed notes. It is due upon 
application for refinancing or assuming a guaranteed note. It is fully 
earned when due and shall be nonrefundable. The Division may waive a 
refinancing or assumption fee's payment when the refinancing or 
assumption's primary purpose is to protect the U.S.
    (d) Where payable. Fees are payable by check made payable to ``NMFS/
FSFF.'' Other than those collected at application or closing, fees are 
payable by mailing checks to: U.S. Department of Commerce, National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries 
Service, P.O. Box 73004, Chicago, Ill. 60673. To ensure proper 
crediting, each check must include the official case number the Division 
assigns to each guarantee.


<R05>
Sec. 253.17  Demand and payment.

    Every demand must be delivered in writing to the Division. Each must 
include the noteholder's certified record of the date and amount of each 
payment made on the guaranteed note and the manner of its application. 
Should the Division not acknowledge receipt of a timely demand, the 
noteholder must possess evidence of the demand's timely delivery.


<R05>
Sec. 253.18  Program operating guidelines.

    The Division may issue Program operating guidelines, as the need 
arises, governing national Program policy and administrative issues not 
addressed by these rules.


<R05>
Sec. 253.19  Default and liquidation.

    Upon default of the security documents, the Division shall take such 
remedial action (including, where appropriate, liquidation) as it deems 
best able to protect the U.S.' interest.

<R05>
Sec. 253.21  Apportionment.

    (a) Apportionment formula. The amount of funds apportioned to each 
state is to be determined by the Secretary as the ratio which the 
equally weighted average of the volume and value of fishery resources 
harvested by domestic commercial fishermen and landed within such state 
during the 3 most recent calendar years for which data satisfactory to 
the Secretary are available bears to the total equally weighted average 
of the volume and value of all fishery resources harvested by domestic 
commercial fishermen and landed within all of the states during those 
calendar years.
    (1) The equally weighted average value is determined by the 
following formula:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR01MY96.004

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR01MY96.005

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR01MY96.006

the following actions:
    (i) Determine each state's share according to the apportionment 
formula.
    (ii) Certify the funds to the respective NMFS Regional Director.
    (iii) Instruct NMFS Regional Directors to promptly notify states of 
funds' availability.
    (b) No state, under the apportionment formula in paragraph (a) of 
this section, that has a ratio of one-third of 1 percent or higher may 
receive an apportionment for any fiscal year that is less than 1 percent 
of the total amount of funds available for that fiscal year.
    (c) If a State's ratio under the apportionment formula in paragraph 
(b) of this section is less than one-third of 1 percent, that state may 
receive funding if the state:
    (1) Is signatory to an interstate fishery compact;
    (2) Has entered into an enforcement agreement with the Secretary 
and/or the Secretary of the Interior for a fishery that is managed under 
an interstate fishery management plan;
    (3) Borders one or more of the Great Lakes;
    (4) Has entered into an interstate cooperative fishery management 
agreement and has in effect an interstate fisheries management plan or 
an interstate fisheries research program; or

interjurisdictional fishery resource.
    (d) Any state that has a ratio of less than one-third of 1 percent 
and meets any of the requirements set forth in paragraphs (c) (1) 
through (5) of this section may receive an apportionment for any fiscal 
year that is not less than 0.5 percent of the total amount of funds 
available for apportionment for such fiscal year.
    (e) No state may receive an apportionment under this section for any 
fiscal year that is more than 6 percent of the total amount of funds 
available for apportionment for such fiscal year.
    (f) Unused apportionments. Any part of an apportionment for any 
fiscal year to any state:
    (1) That is not obligated during that year;
    (2) With respect to which the state notifies the Secretary that it 
does not wish to receive that part; or
    (3) That is returned to the Secretary by the state, may not be 
considered to be appropriated to that state and must be added to such 
funds as are appropriated for the next fiscal year. Any notification or 
return of funds by a state referred to in this section is irrevocable.


<R05>
Sec. 253.22  State projects.

    (a) General--(1) Designation of state agency. The Governor of each 
state shall notify the Secretary of which agency of the state government 
is authorized under its laws to regulate commercial fisheries and is, 
therefore, designated receive financial assistance awards. An official 
of such agency shall certify which official(s) is authorized in 
accordance with state law to commit the state to participation under the 
Act, to sign project documents, and to receive payments.
    (2) States that choose to submit proposals in any fiscal year must 
so notify

[[Page 703]]

the NMFS Regional Director before the end of the third quarter of that 
fiscal year.
    (3) Any state may, through its state agency, submit to the NMFS 
Regional Director a completed NOAA Grants and Cooperative Agreement 
Application Package with its proposal for a project, which may be 
multiyear. Proposals must describe the full scope of work, 
specifications, and cost estimates for such project.
    (4) States may submit a proposal for a project through, and request 
payment to be made to, an Interstate Fisheries Commission. Any payment 
so made shall be charged against the apportionment of the appropriate 
state(s). Submitting a project through one of the Commissions does not 
remove the matching funds requirement for any state, as provided in 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (b) Evaluation of projects. The Secretary, before approving any 
proposal for a project, will evaluate the proposal as to its 
applicability, in accordance with 16 U.S.C. 4104(a)(2).
    (c) State matching requirements. The Federal share of the costs of 
any project conducted under this subpart, including a project submitted 
through an Interstate Commission, cannot exceed 75 percent of the total 
estimated cost of the project, unless:
    (1) The state has adopted an interstate fishery management plan for 
the fishery resource to which the project applies; or
    (2) The state has adopted fishery regulations that the Secretary has 
determined are consistent with any Federal fishery management plan for 
the species to which the project applies, in which case the Federal 
share cannot exceed 90 percent of the total estimated cost of the 
project.
    (d) Financial assistance award. If the Secretary approves or 
disapproves a proposal for a project, he or she will promptly give 
written notification, including, if disapproved, a detailed explanation 
of the reason(s) for the disapproval.
    (e) Restrictions. (1) The total cost of all items included for 
engineering, planning, inspection, and unforeseen contingencies in 
connection with any works to be constructed as part of such a proposed 
project shall not exceed 10 percent of the total cost of such works, and 
shall be paid by the state as a part of its contribution to the total 
cost of the project.
    (2) The expenditure of funds under this subpart may be applied only 
to projects for which a proposal has been evaluated under paragraph (b) 
of this section and approved by the Secretary, except that up to $25,000 
each fiscal year may be awarded to a state out of the state's regular 
apportionment to carry out an ``enforcement agreement.'' An enforcement 
agreement does not require state matching funds.
    (f) Prosecution of work. All work must be performed in accordance 
with applicable state laws or regulations, except when such laws or 
regulations are in conflict with Federal laws or regulations such that 
the Federal law or regulation prevails.


<R05>
Sec. 253.23  Other funds.

    (a) Funds for disaster assistance. (1) The Secretary shall retain 
sole authority in distributing any disaster assistance funds made 
available under section 308(b) of the Act. The Secretary may distribute 
these funds after he or she has made a thorough evaluation of the 
scientific information submitted, and has determined that a commercial 
fishery failure of a fishery resource arising from natural or 
undetermined causes has occurred. Funds may only be used to restore the 
resource affected by the disaster, and only by existing methods and 
technology. Any fishery resource used in computing the states' amount 
under the apportionment formula in Sec. 253.21(a) will qualify for 
funding under this section. The Federal share of the cost of any 
activity conducted under the disaster provision of the Act shall be 
limited to 75 percent of the total cost.
    (2) In addition, pursuant to section 308(d) of the Act, the 
Secretary is authorized to award grants to persons engaged in commercial 
fisheries, for uninsured losses determined by the Secretary to have been 
suffered as a direct result of a fishery resource disaster.

[[Page 704]]

Funds may be distributed by the Secretary only after notice and 
opportunity for public comment of the appropriate limitations, terms, 
and conditions for awarding assistance under this section. Assistance 
provided under this section is limited to 75 percent of an uninsured 
loss to the extent that such losses have not been compensated by other 
Federal or State programs.
    (b) Funds for interstate commissions. Funds authorized to support 
the efforts of the three chartered Interstate Marine Fisheries 
Commissions to develop and maintain interstate fishery management plans 
for interjurisdictional fisheries will be divided equally among the 
Commissions.


<R05>
Sec. 253.24  Administrative requirements.

    Federal assistance awards made as a result of this Act are subject 
to all Federal laws, Executive Orders, Office of Management and Budget 
Circulars as incorporated by the award; Department of Commerce and NOAA 
regulations; policies and procedures applicable to Federal financial 
assistance awards; and terms and conditions of the awards.

                          Joint Tax Regulations


<R05>
Sec. 259.1  Execution of agreements and deposits made in a Capital 
Construction Fund.

    In the case of a taxable year of a taxpayer beginning after December 
31, 1969, and before January 1, 1972, the rules governing the execution 
of agreements and deposits under such agreements shall be as follows:
    (a) A capital construction fund agreement executed and entered into 
by the taxpayer on or prior to the due date, with extensions, for the 
filing of his Federal income tax return for such taxable year or years 
will be deemed to be effective on the date of the execution of such 
agreement or as of the close of business of the last regular business 
day of each such taxable year or years to which such deposit relates, 
whichever day is earlier.
    (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, 
where:
    (1) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969, and prior 
to January 1, 1971, an application for a capital construction fund 
agreement is filed by a taxpayer prior to January 1, 1972, and a capital 
construction fund agreement is executed and entered into by the taxpayer 
prior to March 1, 1972, and
    (2) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1970, and prior 
to January 1, 1972, an application for a capital construction fund 
agreement is filed by a taxpayer prior to January 1, 1973, and a capital 
construction fund agreement is executed and entered into by the taxpayer 
prior to March 1, 1973 (or, if earlier, 60 days after the publication of 
final joint regulations under section 607 of the Merchant Marine Act, 
1936, as amended); then such a capital construction fund agreement will 
be deemed to be effective as of the close of business of the last 
regular business day of each such taxable year or years to which such 
deposit related.
    (c)(1) Deposits made in a capital construction fund pursuant to such 
an agreement within 60 days after the date of execution of the 
agreement, or on or prior to the due date, with extensions, for the 
filing of his Federal income tax return for such taxable year or years, 
whichever date shall be later, shall be deemed to have been made on

[[Page 705]]

the date of the actual deposit or as of the close of business of the 
last regular business day of each such taxable year or years to which 
such deposit relates, whichever day is earlier.
    (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, for taxable 
years beginning after December 31, 1970, and ending prior to January 1, 
1972, deposits made later than the last date permitted under paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section but on or before January 9, 1973, in a capital 
construction fund pursuant to an agreement with the Secretary of 
Commerce, acting by and through the Administrator of the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, shall be deemed to have been 
made on the date of the actual deposit or as of the close of business of 
the last regular business day of such taxable year, whichever is 
earlier.
    (d) Nothing in this section shall alter the rules and regulations 
governing the timing of deposits with respect to existing capital and 
special reserve funds or with respect to the treatment of deposits for 
any taxable year or years other than a taxable year or years beginning 
after December 31, 1969, and before January 1, 1972. \1\

Sec. 259.30  Application for Interim Capital Construction Fund 
Agreement (``Interim CCF Agreement'').

    (a) General qualifications. To be eligible to enter into an Interim 
CCF Agreement an applicant must:
    (1) Be a citizen of the United States (citizenship requirements are 
those for documenting vessels in the coastwise trade within the meaning 
of section 2 of the Shipping Act, 1916, as amended);
    (2) Own or lease one or more eligible vessels (as defined in section 
607(k)(1) of the Act) operating in the foreign or domestic commerce of 
the United States.
    (3) Have an acceptable program for the acquisition, construction, or 
reconstruction of one or more qualified vessels (as defined in section 
607(k)(2) of the Act). Qualified vessels must be for commercial 
operation in the fisheries of the United States. If the qualified vessel 
is 5 net tons or over, it must be documented in the fisheries of the 
United States. Dual documentation in both the fisheries and the 
coastwise trade of the United States is permissible. Any vessel which 
will carry fishing parties for hire must be inspected and certified 
(under 46 CFR part 176) by the U.S. Coast Guard as qualified to carry 
more than six passengers or demonstrate to the Secretary's satisfaction 
that the carrying of fishing parties for hire will constitute its 
primary activity. The program must be a firm representation of the 
applicant's actual intentions. Vague or contingent objectives will not 
be acceptable.
    (b) Content of application. Applicants seeking an Interim CCF 
Agreement may make application by letter providing the following 
information:
    (1) Proof of U.S. citizenship;
    (2) The first taxable year for which the Interim CCF Agreement is to 
apply (see Sec. 259.33 for the latest time at which applications for an 
Interim CCF Agreement relating to a previous taxable year may be 
received);
    (3) The following information regarding each ``eligible vessel'' 
which is to be incorporated in Schedule A of the Interim CCF Agreement 
for purposes of making deposits into a CCF pursuant to section 607 of 
the Act:
    (i) Name of vessel,
    (ii) Official number, or, in the case of vessels under 5 net tons, 
the State registration number where required,
    (iii) Type of vessel (i.e., catching vessel, processing vessel, 
transporting vessel, charter vessel, barge, passenger carrying fishing 
vessel, etc.),
    (iv) General characteristic (i.e., net tonnage, fish-carrying 
capacity, age, length, type of fishing gear, number of

[[Page 706]]

passengers carried or in the case of vessels operating in the foreign or 
domestic commerce the various uses of the vessel, etc.),
    (v) Whether owned or leased and, if leased, the name of the owner, 
and a copy of the lease,
    (vi) Date and place of construction,
    (vii) If reconstructed, date of redelivery and place of 
reconstruction,
    (viii) Trade (or trades) in which vessel is documented and date last 
documented,
    (ix) If a fishing vessel, the fishery of operation (which in this 
section means each species or group of species--each species must be 
specifically identified by acceptable common names--of fish, shellfish, 
or other living marine resources which each vessel catches, processes, 
or transports or will catch, process, or transport for commercial 
purposes such as marketing or processing the catch),
    (x) If a fishing vessel, the area of operation (which for fishing 
vessels means the general geographic areas in which each vessel will 
catch, process, or transport, or charter for each species or group of 
species of fish, shellfish, or other living marine resources).
    (4) The specific objectives to be achieved by the accumulation of 
assets in a Capital Construction Fund (to be incorporated in Schedule B 
of the Interim CCF Agreement) including:
    (i) Number of vessels,
    (ii) Type of vessel (i.e., catching, processing, transporting, or 
passenger carrying fishing vessel),
    (iii) General characteristics (i.e., net tonnage, fish-carrying 
capacity, age, length, type of fishing gear, number of passengers 
carried),
    (iv) Cost of projects,
    (v) Amount of indebtedness to be paid for vessels to be constructed, 
acquired, or reconstructed (all notes, mortgages, or other evidences of 
the indebtedness must be submitted as soon as available, together with 
sufficient additional evidence to establish that full proceeds of the 
indebtedness to be paid from a CCF under an Interim CCF Agreement, were 
used solely for the purpose of the construction, acquisition, or 
reconstruction of Schedule B vessels),
    (vi) Date of construction, acquisition, or reconstruction,
    (vii) Fishery of operation (which in this section means each species 
or group of species--each species must be specifically identified by 
acceptable common name--of fish, shellfish, or other living marine 
resources),
    (viii) Area of operation (which in this section means the general 
geographic areas in which each vessel will will operate for each species 
or group of species of fish, shellfish, or other living marine 
resources).
    (c) Filing. The application must be signed and submitted in 
duplicate to the Regional Office of the National Marine Fisheries 
Service's Financial Assistance Division corresponding to the region in 
which the party conducts its business. As a general rule, the Interim 
CCF Agreement must be executed and entered into by the taxpayer on or 
prior to the due date, with extensions, for the filing of the Federal 
tax return in order to be effective for the tax year to which that 
return relates. It is manifestly in the Applicant's best interest to 
file at least 45 days in advance of such date.

<R05>
Sec. 259.31  Acquisition, construction, or reconstruction.

    (a) Acquisition. No vessel having previously been operated in a 
fishery of the United States prior to its acquisition by the party 
seeking CCF withdrawal therefor shall be a qualified vessel for the 
purpose of acquisition, except in the cases specified in paragraphs 
(a)(1) and (2) of this section:
    (1) A vessel not more than 5 years old, at the time of its 
acquisition by the party seeking CCF withdrawal therefor may be a 
qualified vessel for the purpose of acquisition, but only if each 
acquisition in this category becomes a Schedule A vessel and there 
exists for each acquisition in this category (on a one-for-one basis) an 
additional Schedule B construction or reconstruction. The sole 
consideration for permitting an acquisition in this category is that it 
will enable the party (but the Secretary will not attempt to 
predetermine such an ability) to accelerate accomplishment of the 
additional Schedule B construction or

[[Page 707]]

reconstruction. Should this consideration materially fail, the Secretary 
shall, at his discretion, disqualify previously qualified withdrawals in 
this category, seek liquidated damages as provided for in paragraph 
(a)(4) of this section and/or terminate the Interim CCF Agreement.
    (2) A vessel more than 5 years old, but not more than 25 years old 
(special showing required if more than 25 years old, see paragraph (b) 
of this section), at the time of acquisition by the party seeking CCF 
withdrawal therefor may be a qualified vessel for the purpose of 
acquisition, but only if that same vessel becomes a Schedule A vessel 
and (in addition to being a Schedule B vessel for the purpose of its 
acquisition) becomes a Schedule B vessel for the purpose of that same 
vessel's reconstruction to be accomplished ordinarily within 7 years 
from the date of acquisition. The sole consideration for permitting an 
acquisition in this category is that it will enable a party (but the 
Secretary will not attempt to predetermine such an ability) to 
accelerate accomplishment of the Schedule B reconstruction of the vessel 
so acquired. Should this consideration materially fail, the same penalty 
prescribed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section applies.
    (3) Reserved for minimum deposits under this section.
    (4) Reserved for liquidated damages.
    (b) Reconstruction. No reconstruction project costing less than 
$100,000 shall qualify a vessel for reconstruction, unless the 
reconstruction project costs, or will cost, 20 percent or more of the 
reconstructed vessel's acquisition cost (in its unreconstructed state) 
to the party seeking CCF withdrawal therefor. If the reconstruction 
project meets the $100,000 test, then the 20 percent test does not 
apply. Conversely, if the reconstruction project does not meet the 
$100,000 test, then the 20 percent test applies.
    (1) Reconstruction may include rebuilding, replacing, 
reconditioning, converting and/or improving any portion of a vessel. A 
reconstruction project must, however, substantially prolong the useful 
life of the reconstructed vessel, increase its value, or adapt it to a 
different commercial use in the fishing trade or industry.
    (2) All, or the major portion (ordinarily, not less than 80 
percent), of a reconstruction project's actual cost must (for the 
purpose of meeting the above dollar or percentage tests) be classifiable 
as a capital expenditure for Internal Revenue Service (IRS) purposes. 
That otherwise allowable (i.e., for the purpose of meeting the above 
dollar or percentage tests) portion of a reconstruction project's actual 
cost which is not classifiable as a capital expenditure shall, however, 
be excluded from the amount qualified for withdrawal as a result of the 
reconstruction project.
    (3) No vessel more than 25 years old at the time of withdrawal or 
request for withdrawal shall be a qualified vessel for the purpose of 
reconstruction unless a special showing is made, to the Secretary's 
discretionary satisfaction, that the type and degree of reconstruction 
intended will result in an efficient and productive vessel with an 
economically useful life at least 10 years beyond the date 
reconstruction is completed.
    (c) Time permitted for construction or reconstruction. Construction 
or reconstruction must be completed within 18 months from the date 
construction or reconstruction first commences, unless otherwise 
consented to by the Secretary.
    (d) Energy saving improvements. An improvement made to a vessel to 
conserve energy shall, regardless of cost, be treated as a 
reconstruction for the purpose of qualifying a CCF withdrawal for such 
expenditure and shall be exempted from having to meet conditional 
fishery requirements for reconstruction as set forth in Sec. 259.32 and 
from all qualifying tests for reconstruction set forth in paragraph (b) 
of this section with the following exceptions:
    (1) An energy saving improvement shall be required to meet both 
conditional fishery requirements and the qualifying tests for 
reconstruction if it serves the dual purpose of saving energy and 
meeting the reconstruction requirement of paragraph (a) of this section 
for qualifying a withdrawal for the acquisition of a used vessel.
    (2) That portion of the actual cost of an energy saving improvement 
which is

[[Page 708]]

to be paid for from the CCF must be classifiable and treated as a 
capital expenditure for Internal Revenue Service purposes.
    (e) Safety projects. The acquisition and installation of safety 
equipment for a qualified vessel and vessel modifications whose central 
purpose is materially increasing the safety of a qualified vessel or the 
acquisition and installation of equipment required by law or regulation 
that materially increases the safety of a qualified vessel shall, 
regardless of cost, be treated as reconstruction for the purpose of 
qualifying a CCF withdrawal for such expenditure, shall be exempt from 
having to meet conditional fishery requirements for reconstruction as 
set forth in Sec. 259.32, and shall be exempt from all qualifying tests 
for reconstruction set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, with the 
following exceptions:
    (1) A safety improvement shall be required to meet both conditional 
fishery requirements and all qualifying tests for reconstruction if it 
serves the dual purpose of safety and meeting the reconstruction 
requirement of paragraph (a) of this section for qualifying a withdrawal 
for the acquisition of a used vessel;
    (2) That portion of the actual cost of a safety improvement that is 
to be paid for from the CCF must be classifiable and treated as a 
capital expenditure for Internal Revenue Service purposes;
    (3) Safety improvement projects whose clear and central purpose is 
restricted to complying with the requirements of the Commercial Fishing 
Industry Vessel Safety Act of 1988 (Public Law 100-424 Sec. 1, 102 stat. 
1585 (1988) (codified in scattered sections of 46 U.S.C.)) shall, 
without further documentation, be considered to fall within this 
paragraph (e). Satisfactory documentation will be required for all other 
projects proposed to be considered as falling within this paragraph (e). 
Projects not required by law or regulation whose central purpose clearly 
involves something other than an improvement that materially increases 
the safety of a vessel will not be considered to fall within this 
paragraph (e).

<R05>
Sec. 259.32  Conditional fisheries.

    (a) The Secretary may from time-to-time establish certain fisheries 
in which CCF benefits will be restricted. The regulatory mechanism for 
so doing is part 251 of this chapter. Each fishery so restricted is 
termed a ``conditional fishery''. Subpart A of part 251 of this chapter 
establishes the procedure to be used by the Secretary in proposing and 
adopting a fishery as a conditional fishery. Subpart B of part 251 of 
this chapter enumerates each fishery actually adopted as a conditional 
fishery (part 251 of this chapter should be referred to for details). 
The purpose of this Sec. 259.32 is to establish the effect of 
conditional fishery adoption upon Interim CCF Agreements.
    (b) If a written request for an otherwise permissible action under 
an Interim CCF Agreement is submitted prior to the date upon which 
conditional fishery adoption occurs, then the Secretary will act, in an 
otherwise normal manner, upon so much of the action then applied for as 
is then permissible without regard to the subsequent adoption of a 
conditional fishery (even, if that adoption occurs before the Secretary 
gives his consent or issues an Interim CCF Agreement or amendment 
thereto, all as the case may be). Nevertheless, the conditions as set 
forth in paragraph (d) of this section shall apply.
    (c) If a written request for an otherwise permissible action under 
an Interim CCF Agreement, or an application for an Interim CCF 
Agreement, is submitted after the date upon which conditional fishery 
adoption occurs, then the Secretary will act, in an otherwise normal 
manner, upon so much of the action then applied for as is then 
permissible without regard to the previous adoption of a conditional 
fishery provided, however, that this paragraph shall apply only to 
construction or reconstruction for which a binding contract has been 
reduced to writing prior to the date upon which conditional fishery 
adoption occurred. Nevertheless, the conditions as set forth in 
paragraph (d) of this section shall apply.
    (d) Conditional fishery adoption shall have no effect whatsoever 
upon a

[[Page 709]]

Schedule B objective whose qualification for withdrawal (which may be in 
an amount equal to the total cost over time of a Schedule B objective, 
i.e., a series of withdrawals) has been, prior to the date of 
conditional fishery adoption, either consented to by the Secretary or 
requested in accordance with paragraph (b) or (c) of this section. This 
extends to past, present, and future withdrawals in an amount 
representing up to 100 percent of the cost of a Schedule B objective. 
Commencement of any project in these categories shall, however, be 
started not later than 6 months from the date of conditional fishery 
adoption and shall be completed within 24 months from the date of 
conditional fishery adoption, unless for good and sufficient cause shown 
the Secretary, at his discretion, consents to a longer period for either 
project commencement or completion. Consent to the qualification of 
withdrawal for any project in these categories not commenced or 
completed within the periods allowed shall be revoked at the end of the 
periods allowed.
    (e) Conditional fishery adoption shall have no effect whatsoever 
upon Schedule B objectives which will not result in significantly 
increasing harvesting capacity in a fishery adopted as a conditional 
fishery.
    (1) Construction of a new vessel (vessel ``Y'') for operation in an 
adopted conditional fishery shall be deemed to significantly increase 
harvesting capacity in that fishery unless the party causing the ``Y'' 
vessel to be constructed causes (within 1 year after the delivery of 
vessel ``Y'') to be permanently removed from all fishing, or placed 
permanently in a fishery not then adopted as a conditional fishery, 
under such conditions as the Secretary may deem necessary or desirable, 
a vessel (vessel ``Z'') which has during the previous 18 months operated 
substantially in the same fishery as the ``Y'' vessel and which has a 
fishing capacity substantially equivalent to the ``Y'' vessel. Failure 
to remove a vessel could subject all withdrawals to be treated as 
nonqualified and may be cause for termination of the CCF. What 
constitutes substantially equivalent fishing capacity shall be a matter 
for the Secretary's discretion. Ordinarily, in exercising his discretion 
about what does or does not constitute substantially equivalent fishing 
capacity, the Secretary will take into consideration (i) the average 
size of vessels constructed for the adopted conditional fishery in 
question at the time vessel ``Z'' was constructed (or, if constructed 
for a different fishery, the average size of vessels in the adopted 
conditional fishery at the time vessel ``Z'' entered it), (ii) the 
average size of vessels constructed for the adopted conditional fishery 
at the time vessel ``Y'' was or will be constructed, and (iii) such 
other factors as the Secretary may deem material and equitable, 
including the length of time the party had owned or leased vessel ``Z'' 
and the length of time the vessel has operated in the conditional 
fishery. The Secretary will consider these factors, and exercise his 
discretion, in such a way as to encourage use of this program by 
established fishermen who have owned or leased for substantial periods 
vessels which need to be replaced, even though a ``Z'' vessel may have 
been constructed at a time which dictated a lesser fishing capacity than 
dictated for a ``Y'' vessel at the time of its construction.
    (2) Acquisition and/or reconstruction of a used vessel for operation 
in an adopted conditional fishery shall be deemed to significantly 
increase harvesting capacity in that fishery unless the vessel to be 
acquired and/or reconstructed had during the previous 3 years operated 
substantially in the same fishery as the adopted conditional fishery in 
which it will operate after acquisition and/or reconstruction. If less 
than 3 years, then acquisition and/or reconstruction of a used vessel 
for operation in an adopted conditional fishery shall be deemed to 
significantly increase harvesting capacity in that fishery unless there 
occurs vessel removal or permanent placement elsewhere under the same 
conditions specified for construction in paragraph (e)(1) of this 
section.
    (3) Construction of a new vessel or the acquisition and/or 
reconstruction of a used vessel for operation in an adopted conditional 
fishery shall not be deemed to significantly increase the harvesting 
capacity where the vessel

[[Page 710]]

constructed, acquired and/or reconstructed replaces another vessel which 
was lost or destroyed and which had, immediately prior to the loss or 
destruction, operated in the same fishery as the adopted conditional 
fishery, provided, however, that the fishing capacity of the replacement 
vessel has a fishing capacity substantially equivalent to the vessel 
lost or destroyed and that the construction, acquisition and/or 
reconstruction is completed within 2 years after the close of the 
taxable year in which the loss or destruction occurred. The Secretary 
may, at his discretion, and for good and sufficient cause shown, extend 
the replacement period, provided that the request for extension of time 
to replace is timely filed with the Secretary
    (f) Conditional fishery adoption shall have the following effect on 
all Schedule B objectives (whether for acquisition, construction, or 
reconstruction) which the Secretary deems to significantly increase 
harvesting capacity in that fishery, excluding those circumstances 
specifically exempted by paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section 
(which shall be governed by the provisions of paragraphs (b) through (e) 
of this section).
    (1) The Secretary may nevertheless consent to the qualification of 
withdrawal, but only up to an amount not exceeding the total of eligible 
ceilings actually deposited during tax years other than the taxable year 
in which conditional fishery adoption occurs plus a pro-rata portion of 
eligible ceilings generated in the tax year in which conditional fishery 
adoption occurs. Pro-ration shall be according to the number of months 
or any part thereof in a party's tax year which elapse before the 
adoption of the conditional fishery occurs. For example, if a party's 
tax year runs from January 1, 1974, to December 31, 1974, and 
conditional fishery adoption occurs on August 15, 1974, (i.e., during 
the 8th month of the party's tax year), then the pro-rata portion for 
that year is eight-twelfths of the total eligible ceilings generated 
during that year.
    (2) Qualified withdrawals in excess of the amount specified in 
paragraph (f)(1) of this section shall not, during the continuance of 
the adopted conditional fishery, be consented to. Parties at this point 
shall have the following option:
    (i) Make, with the Secretary's consent, a nonqualified withdrawal of 
the excess and discontinue the future deposit of eligible ceilings 
(which may effect termination of the Interim CCF Agreement).
    (ii) Reserve the excess, as well as the future deposit of eligible 
ceilings, for a Schedule B objective not then involving an adopted 
conditional fishery. If amendment of an Interim CCF Agreement is 
necessary in order to include a Schedule B objective not then involving 
an adopted conditional fishery, the party may, with the Secretary's 
consent, make the necessary amendment.
    (iii) Reserve the excess, as well as the future deposit of eligible 
ceilings, for a Schedule B objective involving a then adopted 
conditional fishery in anticipation that the then adopted conditional 
fishery will eventually be disadopted, in which case all deposits of 
eligible ceilings will once again be eligible for the Secretary's 
consent as qualified withdrawals. If the adoption of a conditional 
fishery continues for a substantial length of time and there is no 
forseeable prospect of disadoption, then the Secretary, in his 
discretion, may require paragraph (f)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section to 
be effected.
    (g) The Secretary shall neither enter into a new Interim CCF 
Agreement, nor permit amendment of an existing one, which involves a 
Schedule B objective in a then adopted conditional fishery unless 
paragraph (b), (c) or (d) of this Sec. 259.32 applies or unless the 
Schedule B objective is expressly conditioned upon acquisition 
construction, or reconstruction of the type permitted under paragraph 
(e) of this Sec. 259.32. Such an express condition would not survive 
beyond the time at which conditional fishery status is removed.


<R05>
Sec. 259.33  Constructive deposits and withdrawals; ratification of
withdrawals (as qualified) made without first having obtained 

Secretary's consent; first 
          tax year for which Interim CCF Agreement is effective.

    (a) Periods controlling permissibility. For the purpose of this 
Sec. 259.33, the period between the beginning and the end of a party's 
tax year is designated ``Period (aa)''; the period between the

[[Page 711]]

end of a party's tax year and the party's tax due date for that tax year 
is designated ``Period (bb)''; the period between the party's tax due 
date and the date on which ends the party's last extension (if any) of 
that tax due date is designated ``Period (cc)''.
    (b) Constructive deposits and withdrawals (before Interim CCF 
Agreement effectiveness date). Constructive deposits and withdrawals 
shall be permissible only during the Period (aa) during which a written 
application for an interim CCF Agreement is submitted to the Secretary 
and so much of the next succeeding Period (aa), if any, which occurs 
before the Secretary executes the Interim CCF Agreement previously 
applied for. All otherwise qualified expenditures of eligible ceilings 
during Period (aa) may be consented to by the Secretary as constructive 
deposits and withdrawals: Provided, The applicant's application for an 
Interim CCF Agreement and for consent to constructive deposit and 
withdrawal qualification (together with sufficient supporting data to 
enable the Secretary's execution or issuance of consent) is submitted to 
the Secretary either before the end of Period (bb) or, if extension was 
requested and received, before the end of Period (cc). If, however, the 
Secretary receives the completed application in proper form so close to 
the latest permissible period that the Interim CCF Agreement cannot be 
executed and/or the consent given before the end of Period (bb) or 
Period (cc), whichever applies, then the burden is entirely upon the 
applicant to negotiate with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for such 
relief as may be available (e.g., filing an amended tax return, if 
appropriate). The Secretary willl nevertheless execute the Interim CCF 
Agreement and issue his consent however long past the applicant's Period 
(bb) or Period (cc), whichever applies, the Secretary's administrative 
workload requires. Should IRS relief be, for any reason, unavailable, 
the Secretary shall regard the same as merely due to the applicant's 
having failed to apply in a more timely fashion.
    (c) Constructive deposits (after Interim CCF Agreement effectiveness 
date). The Secretary shall not permit constructive deposits or 
withdrawals after the effective date of an Interim CCF Agreement. 
Eligible ceilings must, after the effective date of an interim CCF 
Agreement, be physically deposited in money or kind in scheduled 
depositories before the last date eligible ceilings for any Period (aa) 
of any party become ineligible for deposit (the last date being Period 
(bb) or Period (cc), whichever applies).
    (d) Ratification of withdrawals (as qualified) made without first 
having obtained Secretary's consent. The Secretary may ratify as 
qualified any withdrawal made without first having obtained the 
Secretary's consent therefor, provided the withdrawal was such as would 
have resulted in the Secretary's consent had it been requested before 
withdrawal, and provided further that the party's request for consent 
(together with sufficient supporting data to enable issuance of the 
Secretary's consent) is submitted to the Secretary either before the end 
of Period (bb) or, if extension was requested and received, before the 
end of Period (cc).
    (1) If, however, the Secretary receives the request in proper form 
so close to the latest permissible period that the consent cannot be 
given before expiration of Period (bb) or Period (cc), whichever 
applies, then the burden is entirely upon the party to negotiate with 
IRS for such relief as may be available (e.g., filing an amended tax 
return, if appropriate). The Secretary will nevertheless issue his 
consent however long past the party's Period (bb) or Period (cc), 
whichever applies, the Secretary's administrative workload requires. 
Should IRS relief be, for any reason, unavailable, the Secretary shall 
regard the same as merely due to the party's having failed to apply in a 
more timely fashion.
    (2) All parties shall be counseled that it is manifestly in their 
best interest to request the Secretary's consent 45 days in advance of 
the expected date of withdrawal. Withdrawals made without the 
Secretary's consent, in reliance on obtaining the Secretary's consent, 
are made purely at a party's own risk. Should any withdrawal made 
without the Secretary's consent prove, for any reason, to be one to 
which the Secretary will not or cannot consent by

[[Page 712]]

ratification, then the result will be either, or both, at the 
Secretary's discretion, an unqualified withdrawal or an involuntary 
termination of the Interim CCF Agreement.
    (3) Should the withdrawal made without having first obtained the 
Secretary's consent be made in pursuance of a project not then an 
eligible Schedule B objective, then the Secretary may entertain an 
application to amend the Interim CCF Agreement's Schedule B objectives 
as the prerequisite to consenting by ratification to the withdrawal, all 
under the same time constraints and conditions as otherwise specified 
herein.
    (4) Any withdrawals made, after the effective date of an Interim CCF 
Agreement, without the Secretary's consent are automatically non-
qualified withdrawals unless the Secretary subsequently consents to them 
by ratification as otherwise specified herein.
    (5) Redeposit of that portion of the ceiling withdrawn without the 
Secretary's consent, and for which such consent is not subsequently 
given (either by ratification or otherwise), shall not be permitted. If 
such a non-qualified withdrawal adversely affects the Interim CCF 
Agreement's general status in any wise deemed by the Secretary, at his 
discretion, to be significant and material, the Secretary may 
involuntarily terminate the Interim CCF Agreement.
    (e) First tax year for which Interim CCF Agreement is effective. An 
Agreement, to be effective for any party's Period (aa), must be executed 
and entered into by the party, and submitted to the Secretary, before 
the end of Period (bb) or Period (cc), whichever applies, for such 
Period (aa). If executed and entered into by the party, and/or received 
by the Secretary, after the end of Period (bb) or Period (cc), whichever 
applies, then the Agreement will be first effective for the next 
succeeding Period (aa).
    (1) If, however, the Secretary receives an Agreement executed and 
entered into by the party in proper form so close to the latest 
permissible period that the Secretary cannot execute the Agreement 
before expiration of Period (bb) or Period (cc), whichever applies, then 
the burden is entirely upon the party to negotiate with IRS for such 
relief as may be available (e.g., filing an amended tax return, if 
appropriate). The Secretary will nevertheless execute the Agreement 
however long past the party's Period (bb) or Period (cc), whichever 
applies, the Secretary's administrative workload requires. Should IRS 
relief be, for any reason, unavailable, the Secretary shall regard the 
same as merely due to the party's having failed to apply in a more 
timely manner.
    (2) All parties shall be counseled that it is manifestly in their 
best interest to enter into and execute an Agreement, and submit the 
same to the Secretary, at least 45 days in advance of the Period (bb) or 
Period (cc), whichever applies, for the Period (aa) for which the 
Agreement is first intended to be effective.


<R05>
Sec. 259.34  Minimum and maximum deposits; maximum time to deposit.

    (a) Minimum annual deposit. The minimum annual (based on each 
party's taxable year) deposit required by the Secretary in order to 
maintain an Interim CCF Agreement shall be an amount equal to 2 percent 
of the total anticipated cost of all Schedule B objectives unless such 2 
percent exceeds during any tax year 50 percent of a party's Schedule A 
taxable income, in which case the minimum deposit for that year shall be 
50 percent of the party's Schedule A taxable income.
    (1) Minimum annual deposit compliance shall be audited at the end of 
each party's taxable year unless any one or more of the Schedule B 
objectives is scheduled for commencement more than 3 taxable years in 
advance of the taxable year in which the agreement is effected, in which 
case minimum annual deposit compliance shall be audited at the end of 
each 3 year taxable period. In any taxable year, a Party may apply any 
eligible amount in excess of the 2 percent minimum annual deposit toward 
meeting the party's minimum annual deposit requirement in past or future 
years: Provided, however, At the end of each 3 year period, the 
aggregate amount in the fund must be in compliance with 2 percent 
minimum annual deposit rule (unless the

[[Page 713]]

50 percent of taxable income situation applies).
    (2) The Secretary may, at his discretion and for good and sufficient 
cause shown, consent to minimum annual deposits in any given tax year or 
combination of tax years in an amount lower than prescribed herein: 
Provided, The party demonstrates to the Secretary's satisfaction the 
availability of sufficient funds from any combination of sources to 
accomplish Schedule B objectives at the time they are scheduled for 
accomplishment.
    (b) Maximum deposits. Other than the maximum annual ceilings 
established by the Act, the Secretary shall not establish a maximum 
annual ceiling: Provided, however, That deposits can no longer be made 
once a party has deposited 100 percent of the anticipated cost of all 
Schedule B objectives, unless the Interim CCF Agreement is then amended 
to establish additional Schedule B objectives.
    (c) Maximum time to deposit. Ten years shall ordinarily be the 
maximum time the Secretary shall permit in which to accumulate deposits 
prior to commencement of any given Schedule B objective. A time longer 
than 10 years, either by original scheduling or by subsequent extension 
through amendment, may, however, be permitted at the Secretary's 
discretion and for good and sufficient cause shown.


<R05>
Sec. 259.35  Annual deposit and withdrawal reports required.

    (a) The Secretary will require from each Interim CCF Agreement 
holder (Party) the following annual deposit and withdrawal reports. 
Failure to submit such reports may be cause for involuntary termination 
of CCF Agreements.
    (1) A preliminary deposit and withdrawal report at the end of each 
calendar year, which must be submitted not later than 45 days after the 
close of the calendar year. The report must give the amounts withdrawn 
from and deposited into the party's CCF during the subject year, and be 
in letter form showing the agreement holder's name, FVCCF identification 
number, and taxpayer identification number. Each report must bear 
certification that the deposit and withdrawal information given includes 
all deposit and withdrawal activity for the year and the account 
reported. Negative reports must be submitted in those cases where there 
is no deposit and/or withdrawal activity. If the party's tax year is the 
same as the calendar year, and if the final deposit and withdrawal 
report required under paragraph (a)(2) of this section is submitted 
before the due date for this preliminary report, then this report is not 
required.
    (2) A final deposit and withdrawal report at the end of the tax 
year, which shall be submitted not later than 30 days after expiration 
of the due date, with extensions (if any), for filing the party's 
Federal income tax return. The report must be made on a form prescribed 
by the Secretary using a separate form for each FVCCF depository. Each 
report must bear certification that the deposit and withdrawal 
information given includes all deposit and withdrawal activity for the 
year and account reported. Negative reports must be submitted in those 
cases where there is no deposit and/or withdrawal activity.
    (b) Failure to submit the required annual deposit and withdrawal 
reports shall be cause after due notice for either, or both, 
disqualification of withdrawals or involuntary termination of the 
Interim CCF Agreement, at the Secretary's discretion.
    (c) Additionally, the Secretary shall require from each Interim CCF 
Agreement holder, not later than 30 days after expiration of the party's 
tax due date, with extensions (if any), a copy of the party's Federal 
Income Tax Return filed with IRS for the preceding tax year. Failure to 
submit shall after due notice be cause for the same adverse action 
specified in the paragraph above.

[39 FR 33675, Sept. 19, 1974, as amended at 48 FR 57302, Dec. 29, 1983; 
53 FR 35203, Sept. 12, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 259.36  CCF accounts.

    (a) General: Each CCF account in each scheduled depository shall 
have an account number, which must be reflected on the reports required 
by Sec. 259.35. All CCF accounts shall be reserved only for CCF 
transactions. There shall be no intermingling of CCF

[[Page 714]]

and non-CCF transactions and there shall be no pooling of 2 or more CCF 
accounts without prior consent of the Secretary. Safe deposit boxes, 
safes, or the like shall not be eligible CCF depositories without the 
Secretary's consent and then only under such conditions as the 
Secretary, in his discretion, prescribes.
    (b) Assignment: The use of Fund assets for transactions in the 
nature of a countervailing balance, compensating balance, pledge, 
assignment, or similar security arrangement shall constitute a material 
breach of the Agreement unless prior written consent of the Secretary is 
obtained.
    (c) Depositories: (1) Section 607(c) of the Act provides that 
amounts in a CCF must be kept in the depository or depositories 
specified in the Agreements and be subject to such trustee or other 
fiduciary requirements as the Secretary may specify.
    (2) Unless otherwise specified in the Agreement, the party may 
select the type or types of accounts in which the assets of the Fund may 
be deposited.
    (3) Non-cash deposits or investments of the Fund should be placed in 
control of a trustee under the following conditions:
    (i) The trustee should be specified in the Agreement;
    (ii) The trust instrument should provide that all investment 
restrictions stated in section 607(c) of the Act will be observed;
    (iii) The trust instrument should provide that the trustee will give 
consideration to the party's withdrawal requirements under the Agreement 
when investing the Fund;
    (iv) The trustee must agree to be bound by all rules and regulations 
which have been or will be promulgated governing the investment or 
management of the Fund.


<R05>
Sec. 259.37  Conditional consents to withdrawal qualification.

    The Secretary may conditionally consent to the qualification of 
withdrawal, such consent being conditional upon the timely submission to 
the Secretary of such further proofs, assurances, and advices as the 
Secretary, in his discretion, may require. Failure of a party to comply 
with the conditions of such a consent within a reasonable time and after 
due notice shall, at the Secretary's discretion, be cause for either, or 
both, nonqualification of withdrawal or involuntary Interim CCF 
Agreement termination.


<R05>
Sec. 259.38  Miscellaneous.

    (a) Wherever the Secretary prescribes time constraints herein for 
the submission of any CCF transactions, the postmark date shall control 
if mailed or, if personally delivered, the actual date of submission. 
All required materials may be submitted to any Financial Assistance 
Division office of the National Marine Fisheries Service.
    (b) All CCF information received by the Secretary shall be held 
strictly confidential, except that it may be published or disclosed in 
statistical form provided such publication does not disclose, directly 
or indirectly, the identity of any fundholder.
    (c) While recognizing that precise regulations are necessary in 
order to treat similarly situated parties similarly, the Secretary also 
realizes that precision in regulations can often cause inequitable 
effects to result from unavoidable, unintended, or minor discrepancies 
between the regulations and the circumstances they attempt to govern. 
The Secretary will, consequently, at his discretion, as a matter of 
privilege and not as a matter of right, attempt to afford relief to 
parties where literal application of the purely procedural, as opposed 
to substantive, aspects of these regulations would otherwise work an 
inequitable hardship. This privilege will be sparingly granted and no 
party should before the fact attempt to act in reliance on its being 
granted after the fact.
    (d) These Sec. Sec. 259.30 through 259.38 are applicable absolutely 
to all Interim CCF Agreements first entered into (or the amendment of 
all then existing Interim CCF Agreements, which amendment is first 
entered into) on or after the date these Sec. Sec. 259.30 through 
259.38 are adopted. These Sec. Sec. 259.30 through 259.38 are 
applicable to all Interim CCF Agreements entered into before the date 
these Sec. Sec. 259.30 through 259.38 are adopted, with the following 
exceptions only:

[[Page 715]]

    (1) The vessel age limitations imposed by Sec. 259.31 shall not 
apply to already scheduled Schedule B objectives.
    (2) The minimum deposits imposed by Sec. 259.34 shall not apply to 
any party's tax year before that party's tax year next following the one 
in which these Sec. Sec. 259.30 through 259.38 are adopted.
    (e) These Sec. Sec. 259.30 through 259.38 are specifically 
incorporated in all past, present, and future Interim CCF Agreements by 
reference thereto made in Whereas Clause number 2 of all such Interim 
CCF Agreements.

<R05>
Sec. 260.20  Disposition of inspected sample.

    Any sample of a processed product that has been used for inspection 
may be returned to the applicant, at his request and expense; otherwise 
it shall be destroyed, or disposed of to a charitable institution.


<R05>
Sec. 260.21  Basis of inspection and grade or compliance determination.

    (a) Inspection service shall be performed on the basis of the 
appropriate U.S. standards for grades of processed products, Federal, 
Military, Veterans Administration or other government agency 
specifications, written contract specification, or any written 
specification or instruction which is approved by the Secretary.
    (b) Unless otherwise approved by the Director compliance with such 
grade standards, specifications, or instructions shall be determined by 
evaluating the product, or sample, in accordance with the requirements 
of such standards, specifications, or instructions: Provided, That when 
inspection for quality is based on any U.S. grade standard which 
contains a scoring system the grade to be assigned to a lot is the grade 
indicated by the average of the total scores of the sample units: 
Provided further, That:
    (1) Such sample complies with the applicable standards of quality 
promulgated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act;
    (2) Such sample complies with the product description;
    (3) Such sample meets the indicated grade with respect to factors of 
quality which are not rated by score points; and
    (4) With respect to those factors of quality which are rated by 
score points, each of the following requirements is met:
    (i) None of the sample units falls more than one grade below the 
indicated grade because of any quality factor to which a limiting rule 
applies;
    (ii) None of the sample units falls more than 4 score points below 
the minimum total score for the indicated grade; and
    (iii) The number of sample units classed as deviants does not exceed 
the applicable acceptance number indicated in the sampling plans 
contained in Sec. 260.61. A ``deviant,'' as used in this paragraph, 
means a sample unit that falls into the next grade below the indicated 
grade but does not score more than 4 points below the minimum total 
score for the indicated grade.
    (5) If any of the provisions contained in paragraphs (b)(3) and (4) 
of this section are not met the grade is determined by considering such 
provisions in connection with succeedingly lower

[[Page 722]]

grades until the grade of the lot, if assignable, is established.


<R05>
Sec. 260.22  Order of inspection service.

    Inspection service shall be performed, insofar as practicable, in 
the order in which applications therefor are made except that precedence

States (including, but not being limited to, any instrumentality or 
agency thereof) and to any application for an appeal inspection.


<R05>
Sec. 260.23  Postponing inspection service.

    If the inspector determines that it is not possible to accurately 
ascertain the quality or condition of a processed product immediately 
after processing because the product has not reached equilibrium in 
color, or drained weight, or for any other substantial reason, he may 
postpone inspection service for such period as may be necessary.


<R05>

    No inspector shall inspect any processed product in which he is 
directly or indirectly financially interested.


<R05>
Sec. 260.25  Forms of certificates.

by the Secretary, to affix the inspector's signature to an inspection 
certificate which has been prepared in accordance with the facts set 
forth in the notes, made by the inspector, in connection with the 
inspection.
    (b) A certificate of loading shall be issued and signed by the 
inspector or licensed sampler authorized to check the loading of a 
specific lot of processed products: Provided, That, another employee of 
the inspection service may sign such certificate of loading covering any 
processed product checkloaded by an inspector or licensed sampler when 
given power of attorney by such inspector or licensed sampler and 
authorized by the Secretary to affix the inspector's or licensed

inspector or licensed sampler in connection with the checkloading of a 
specific lot of processed products.


<R05>
Sec. 260.27  Issuance of corrected certificates.

    A corrected inspection certificate may be issued by the inspector 
who issued the original certificate after distribution of a certificate 
if errors, such as incorrect dates, code marks, grade statements, lot or 
car numbers, container sizes, net or drained weights, quantities, or 
errors in any other pertinent information require the issuance of a 
corrected certificate. Whenever a corrected certificate is issued, such 
certificate shall supersede the inspection certificate which was issued 
in error and the superseded certificate shall become null and void after 
the issuance of the corrected certificate.


<R05>
Sec. 260.28  Issuance of an inspection report in lieu of an inspection certificate.

    A letter report in lieu of an inspection certificate may be issued

[31 FR 16052, Dec. 15, 1966, as amended at 36 FR 18738, Sept. 21, 1971]


<R05>
Sec. 260.39  When appeal inspection may be refused.

    An application for an appeal inspection may be refused if:
    (a) The reasons for the appeal inspection are frivolous or not 
substantial;
    (b) The quality or condition of the processed product has undergone 
a material change since the inspection covering the processed product on 
which the appeal inspection is requested;
    (c) The lot in question is not, or cannot be made accessible for the 
selection of officially drawn samples;
    (d) The lot relative to which appeal inspection is requested cannot 
be positively identified by the inspector as the lot from which 
officially drawn samples were previously inspected; or
    (e) There is noncompliance with the regulations in this part. Such 
applicant shall be notified promptly of the reason for such refusal.


<R05>
Sec. 260.40  Who shall perform appeal inspection.

inspectors: Provided, That the inspector who made the inspection on 
which the appeal is requested may be authorized to draw the samples when

[[Page 724]]

another inspector or licensed sampler is not available in the area where 
the product is located.


<R05>
Sec. 260.41  Appeal inspection certificate.

    After an appeal inspection has been completed, an appeal inspection 
certificate shall be issued showing the results of such appeal 
inspection; and such certificate shall supersede the inspection 
certificate previously issued for the processed product involved. Each 
appeal inspection certificate shall clearly identify the number and date 
of the inspection certificate which it supersedes. The superseded 
certificate shall become null and void upon the issuance of the appeal 
inspection certificate and shall no longer represent the quality or 
condition of the processed product described therein. The inspector or 
inspectors issuing an appeal inspection certificate shall forward notice 
of such issuance to such persons as he considers necessary to prevent 
misuse of the superseded certificate if the original and all copies of 
such superseded certificate have not previously been delivered to the 
inspector or inspectors issuing the appeal inspection certificate. The

    (c) A statement that he agrees to comply with all terms and 
conditions of the regulations in this part relating to duties of 
licensed samplers; and
    (d) Such other information as may be requested.


<R05>
Sec. 260.49  Inspectors.

    Inspections will ordinarily be performed by employees under the 
Secretary who are employed as Federal Government employees for that 
purpose. However, any person employed under any joint Federal-State 
inspection service arrangement may be licensed, if otherwise qualified, 
by the Secretary to make inspections in accordance with this part on 
such processed products as may be specified in his license. Such license 
shall be issued only in a case where the Secretary is satisfied that the 
particular person is qualified to perform adequately the inspection 
service for which such person is to be licensed. Each such license shall 
bear the printed signature of the Secretary and shall be countersigned 
by an authorized employee of the Department. An inspector shall perform 
his duties pursuant to the regulations in this part as directed by the 
Director.

[[Page 725]]


<R05>
Sec. 260.50  Suspension or revocation of license of licensed sampler
or licensed inspector.

    Pending final action by the Secretary, the Director may, whenever he 
deems such action necessary, suspend the license of any licensed 
sampler, or licensed inspector, issued pursuant to the regulations in 
this part, by giving notice of such suspension to the respective 
licensee, accompanied by a statement of the reasons therefor. Within 7 
days after the receipt of the aforesaid notice and statement of reasons 
by such licensee, he may file an appeal, in writing, with the Secretary 
supported by any argument or evidence that he may wish to offer as to 
why his license should not be suspended or revoked. After the expiration 
of the aforesaid 7 day period and consideration of such argument and 
evidence, the Secretary shall take such action as he deems appropriate 
with respect to such suspension or revocation.


<R05>
Sec. 260.51  Surrender of license.

    Upon termination of his services as a licensed sampler or licensed 
inspector, or suspension or revocation of his license, such licensee 
shall surrender his license immediately to the office of inspection 
serving the area in which he is located. These same provisions shall 
apply in a case of an expired license.

                                Sampling


<R05>
Sec. 260.57  How samples are drawn by inspectors or licensed samplers.

    An inspector or a licensed sampler shall select samples, upon 
request, from designated lots of processed products which are so placed 
as to permit thorough and proper sampling in accordance with the 
regulations in this part. Such person shall, unless otherwise directed 
by the Secretary, select sample units of such products at random, and 
from various locations in each lot in such manner and number, not 
inconsistent with the regulations in this part, as to secure a 
representative sample of the lot. Samples drawn for inspection shall be 
furnished by the applicant at no cost to the Department.


<R05>
Sec. 260.58  Accessibility for sampling.

    Each applicant shall cause the processed products for which 
inspection is requested to be made accessible for proper sampling. 
Failure to make any lot accessible for proper sampling shall be 
sufficient cause for postponing inspection service until such time as 
such lot is made accessible for proper sampling.


<R05>
Sec. 260.59  How officially drawn samples are to be identified.

    Officially drawn samples shall be marked by the inspector or 
licensed sampler so such samples can be properly identified for 
inspection.


<R05>
Sec. 260.60  How samples are to be shipped.

    Unless otherwise directed by the Secretary, samples which are to be 
shipped to any office of inspection shall be forwarded to the office of 
inspection serving the area in which the processed prodcuts from which 
the samples were drawn is located. Such samples shall be shipped in a 
manner to avoid, if possible, any material change in the quality or 
condition of the sample of the processed product. All transportation 
charges in connection with such shipments of samples shall be at the 
expense of the applicant and wherever practicable, such charges shall be 
prepaid by him.


<R05>
Sec. 260.61  Sampling plans and procedures for determining
lot compliance.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided for in this section in connection 
with in-plant inspection and unless otherwise approved by the Secretary, 
samples shall be selected from each lot in the exact number of sample 
units indicated for the lot size in the applicable single sampling plan 
or, at the discretion of the inspection service, any comparable multiple 
sampling plan: Provided, That at the discretion of the inspection 
service the number of sample units selected may be increased to the 
exact number of sample units indicated for any one of the larger sample 
sizes provided for in the appropriate plans.
    (b) Under the single sampling plans with respect to any specified 
requirement:

[[Page 726]]

    (1) If the number of deviants (as defined in connection with the 
specific requirements) in the sample does not exceed the acceptance 
number prescribed for the sample size the lot meets the requirement;
    (2) If the number of deviants (as defined in connection with the 
specific requirement) in the sample exceeds the acceptance number 
prescribed for the sample size the lot fails the requirement.
    (c) Under the multiple sampling plans inspection commences with the 
smallest sample size indicated under the appropriate plan and with 
respect to any specified requirement:
    (1) If the number of deviants (as defined in connection with the 
specific requirement) in the sample being considered does not exceed the 
acceptance number prescribed for that sample size the lot meets the 
requirement;
    (2) If the number of deviants (as defined in connection with the 
specific requirement) in the sample being considered equals or exceeds 
the rejection number prescribed for that sample size the lot fails the 
requirement; or
    (3) If the number of deviants (as defined in connection with the 
specific requirement) in the sample being considered falls between the 
acceptance and rejection numbers of the plan, additional sample units 
are added to the sample so that the sample thus cumulated equals the 
next larger cumulative sample size in the plan. It may then be 
determined that the lot meets or fails the specific requirement by 
considering the cumulative sample and applying the procedures outlined 
in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section or by considering 
successively larger samples cumulated in the same manner until the lot 
meets or fails the specific requirement.
    (d) If in the conduct of any type of in-plant inspection the sample 
is examined before the lot size is known and the number of sample units 
exceeds the prescribed sample size for such lot but does not equal any 
of the prescribed larger sample sizes the lot may be deemed to meet or 
fail a specific requirement in accordance with the following procedure:
    (1) If the number of deviants (as defined in connection with the 
specific requirement) in the nonprescribed sample does not exceed the 
acceptance number of the next smaller sample size the lot meets the 
requirements;
    (2) If the number of deviants (as defined in connection with the 
specific requirement) in the nonprescribed sample equals the acceptance 
number prescribed for the next larger sample size additional sample 
units shall be selected to increase the sample to the next larger 
prescribed sample size;
    (3) If the number of deviants (as defined in connection with the 
specific requirement) in the nonprescribed sample exceeds the acceptance 
number prescribed for the next larger sample size the lot fails the 
requirement.
    (e) In the event that the lot compliance determination provisions of 
a standard or specification are based on the number of specified 
deviations instead of deviants the procedures set forth in this section 
may be applied by substituting the word ``deviation'' for the word 
``deviant'' wherever it appears.
    (f) Sampling plans referred to in this section are those contained 
in Tables I, II, III, IV, V, and VI which follow or any other plans 
which are applicable. For processed products not included in these 
tables, the minimum sample size shall be the exact number of sample 
units prescribed in the table, container group, and lot size that, as 
determined by the inspector, most closely resembles the product, type, 
container size and amount of product to be samples.

bases for the suspension, did not occur or will not cause serious and 
irreparable injury to the inspection program and services provided under 
the regulations of this subchapter. This determination of the Hearing 
Examiner on the continuation or termination of the temporary suspension 
shall be final and there shall be no appeal of this determination. The

of this section or the temporary suspension is terminated by the Hearing 
Examiner.

the suspension will remain in effect until a final decision on the 
debarment is rendered in accordance with the regulations of this section 
or the temporary suspension is terminated by the Hearing Examiner.
    (c) Hearing Examiner. All hearing shall be held before a Hearing 
Examiner appointed by the Secretary or the Director.
    (d) Hearing. If one or more of the acts or activities described in 
paragraph (a) of this section have occurred, the Director may institute 
a hearing to determine the length of time during which the person shall 
be debarred and those plants to which the debarment shall apply. No 
person may be debarred unless there is a hearing, as prescribed in this 
section, and it has been determined by the Hearing Examiner, based on 
evidence of record, that the one or more of the activities described in 
paragraph (a) of this section have occurred. Any debarment or suspension

    (b) A proposal for a new or revised U.S. grade standard may include 
the following:
    (1) Scope and product description, which describes the products that 
are eligible for grading using the standard (e.g., fish portion, fish 
fillet).
    (2) Product forms, which describe the types, styles and market forms 
covered by the standard (e.g., skin-off, tail-on, headless).
    (3) Grade and inspection marks, which describe the grades and 
inspection mark criteria for each grade category (e.g., Grade A <= 15 
points).
    (4) Grade determination, which describes the means by which the 
grade is determined (i.e., the factors rated by score points and those 
that are not). Standards may contain defect grouping limiting rules that 
contain additional provisions that must be met.
    (5) Sampling, which describes the method of sampling and sample unit 
sizes (e.g., 10 portions, 8 ounces, etc.).
    (6) Procedures that describe the process used to determine the 
product grade (e.g., label declarations, sensory evaluation).
    (7) Definitions of defects, which outline the defects associated 
with the products covered by the standard, defines them, and describes 
the method of counting or measuring the defects. This section may 
provide associated defect points or reference a defect table (e.g., 
bruises, blood spots, bones, black spots, coating defects, 1-inch 
squares, percent by weight, ratios).
    (8) Defect point assessment, which describes how to assess points 
and provides any special guidance that may be necessary to the 
particular standard (e.g., defect points for certain categories are 
added together and divided by the weight of the sample unit; the number 
of instances are counted to determine if it is slight, moderate, or 
excessive defect).
    (9) Tolerances for lot certification, which provide the sections 
from Title 50 CFR that regulate lot certification.
    (10) Hygiene, which specifies the sections of applicable Federal 
regulations regulating the safe, wholesome production of food for human 
consumption.
    (11) Methods of analysis, which describe the methods of analysis 
that will be used in the evaluation of the products covered by the 
standard for grades (e.g., net weight, deglazing, debreading).
    (12) Defect table, which is the table of defects and associated 
points to be assessed for each defect.

<R05>
Sec. 270.4  Review of application.

    Within 180 days of receipt of the application to establish a 
Council, NMFS will:
    (a) Determine if the application is complete and complies with all 
of the requirements set out in Sec. 270.3 and complies with all 
provisions of the Act and other applicable laws.
    (b) Identify, to the extent practicable, those sector participants 
who meet the requirements for eligibility to participate in the 
referendum to establish the Council. NMFS may require additional 
information from the applicants or proposed participants in order to 
verify eligibility. NMFS may add names to or delete names from the list 
of sector participants believed eligible by the applicants until the 
time of the referendum based on additional information received.
    (c) If NMFS finds minor deficiencies in an application that can be 
corrected within the 180-day review period, NMFS will advise the 
applicants in writing of what must be submitted by a specific date to 
correct the minor deficiencies.
    (d) If NMFS makes a final negative determination, on an application, 
NMFS will advise the applicant in writing of the reason for the 
determination. The applicant may submit another application at any time 
thereafter. NMFS then has 180 days from receipt of the new application 
to render a final determination on its acceptability.


<R05>
Sec. 270.5  Conduct of referendum.

    (a) Upon making affirmative determinations under Sec. 270.4, NMFS, 
within 90 days after the date of the last affirmative determination, 
will conduct a referendum on the adoption of the proposed charter.
    (b) NMFS will estimate the cost of conducting the referendum, notify 
the applicants, and request that applicants post a bond or provide other 
applicable security, such as a cashierSec. s check, to cover costs of 
the referendum.
    (c) NMFS will initially pay all costs of a referendum to establish a 
Council. Within two years after establishment, the Council must 
reimburse NMFS for the total actual costs of the referendum from 
assessments collected by

[[Page 752]]

the Council. If a referendum fails to result in establishment of a 
Council, NMFS will immediately recover all expenses incurred for 
conducting the referendum from the bond or security posted by 
applicants. In either case, such expenses will not include salaries of 
government employees or other administrative overhead, but will be 
limited to those additional direct costs incurred in connection with 
conducting the referendum.
    (d) No less than 30 days prior to holding a referendum, NMFS will:
    (1) Publish in the Federal Register the text of the proposed charter 
and the most complete list available of sector participants eligible to 
vote in the referendum; and
    (2) Provide for public comment, including the opportunity for a 
public meeting.


<R05>
Sec. 270.6  Sector participants eligible to vote.

    (a) Any participant who meets the minimum requirements as measured 
by income, volume of sales or other relevant factors specified in the 
approved charter may vote in a referendum.
    (b) Only one vote may be cast by each participant who is eligible to 
vote, regardless of the number of individuals that make up such 
``participant'' and how many sectors the participant is engaged in. The 
vote may be made by any responsible officer, owner, or employee 
representing a participant.


<R05>
Sec. 270.7  Results of referendum.

    (a) Favorable vote to establish a Council. NMFS will, by order of 
publication in the Federal Register, establish the Council and approve 
an acceptable proposed charter, if the referendum votes which are cast 
in favor of the proposed charter constitute a majority of the sector 
participants voting in each and every sector. Further, according to the 
best available data, the majority must collectively account for, in the 
12-month period immediately preceding the month in which the proposed 
charter was filed, at least 66 percent of the value of the fish and fish 
products described in the proposed charter handled during such period in 
each sector by those who meet the eligibility requirements to vote in 
the referendum as defined by the applicants.
    (b) Unfavorable vote to establish a Council. If a referendum fails 
to pass in any sector of the proposed Council, NMFS will not establish 
the Council or approve the proposed charter. NMFS will immediately 
recover the cost of conducting the referendum according to Sec. 
270.5(c).
    (c) Notification of referendum results. NMFS will notify the 
applicants of the results of the referendum and publish the results of 
the referendum in the Federal Register.

Sec. 270.8  Nomination and appointment of Council members.

    (a) Within 30 days after a Council is established, NMFS will solicit 
nominations for Council members from the sectors represented on the 
Council in accordance with the approved charter. If the harvesters and 
receivers represented on the Council are engaged in business in two or 
more states, but within the geographic area of the Council, the 
nominations made under this section must, to the extent practicable, 
result in equitable representation for those states. Nominees must be 
knowledgeable and experienced with regard to the activities of, or have 
been actively engaged in the business of, the sector that such person 
will represent on the Council. Therefore, a resume will be required for 
each nominee.
    (b) In accordance with 16 U.S.C. 4009(f), NMFS will, within 60 days 
after the end of the 30-day period, appoint the members of the Council 
from among the nominees.


<R05>
Sec. 270.9  Terms, vacancies, and removal of Council members.

    (a) A Council term is for 3 years, except for initial appointments 
to a newly established Council where:
    (1) Half of the Council member terms will be 2 years; and
    (2) Half of the Council member terms will be 3 years.
    (b) A vacancy on a Council will be filled, within 60 days after the

Sec. 270.14  Update of sector participant data.

    The Council will submit to NMFS at the end of each fiscal year an 
updated list of sector participants who meet the minimum requirements 
for eligibility to participate in a referendum as stated in the approved 
charter.


<R05>
Sec. 270.15  Quality standards.

    (a) Each Council may develop and submit to NMFS for approval or, 
upon the request of a Council, NMFS will develop quality standards for 
the species of fish or fish products described in the approved charter. 
Any quality standard developed under this paragraph must be consistent 
with the purposes of the Act.
    (b) A quality standard developed under paragraph (a) of this section 
may be adopted by a Council by a majority of its members following a 
referendum conducted by the Council among sector participants of the 
concerned sector(s). In order for a quality standard to be brought 
before Council members for adoption, the majority of the sector 
participants of the concerned sector(s) must vote in favor of the 
standard. Further, according to the best available data, the majority 
must collectively account for, in the 12-month period immediately 
preceding the month in which the referendum is held, not less than 66 
percent of the value of the fish or fish products described in the 
charter that were handled during such period in that sector by those who 
meet the eligibility requirements to vote in the referendum as defined 
by the petitioners.
    (c) The Council must submit a plan to conduct the referendum on the 
quality standards to NMFS for approval at least 60 days in advance of 
such referendum date. The plan must consist of the following:
    (1) Date(s) for conducting the referendum;
    (2) Method (by mail or in person);
    (3) Copy of the proposed notification to sector participants 
informing them of the referendum;
    (4) List of sector participants eligible to vote;
    (5) Name of individuals responsible for conducting the referendum;
    (6) Copy of proposed ballot package to be used in the referendum; 
and
    (7) Date(s) and location of ballot counting.
    (d) An official observer appointed by NMFS will be allowed to be 
present at the ballot counting and any other phase of the referendum 
process, and may take whatever steps NMFS deems appropriate to verify 
the validity of the process and results of the referendum.
    (e) Quality standards developed under this section of the 
regulations must, at a minimum, meet Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
minimum requirements for fish and fish products for human consumption.
    (f) Quality standards must be consistent with applicable standards 
of the U.S. Department of Commerce (National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration) or other recognized Federal standards and/or 
specifications for fish and fish products.
    (g) No quality standard adopted by a Council may be used in the 
advertising or promotion of fish or fish products as being inspected by 
the United States Government unless the standard requires sector 
participants to be in the U.S. Department of Commerce voluntary seafood 
inspection program.
    (h) The intent of quality standards must not be to discriminate 
against importers who are not members of the Council.
    (i) Quality standards must not be developed for the purpose of 
creating non-tariff barriers. Such standards must be compatible with 
U.S. obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or 
under other international standards deemed acceptable by NMFS.
    (j) The procedures applicable to the adoption and the operation of 
quality standards developed under this subchapter also apply to 
subsequent amendments or the termination of such standards.
    (k) With respect to a quality standard adopted under this section, 
the Council must develop and file with NMFS an official identifier in 
the form of a symbol, stamp, label or seal that will be used to indicate 
that a fish or fish product meets the quality standard at the time the 
official identifier is

[[Page 756]]

affixed to the fish or fish product, or is affixed to or printed on the 
packaging material of the fish or fish product. The use of such 
identifier is governed by Sec. 270.15.


<R05>
Sec. 270.16  Deposit of funds.

    All funds collected or received by a Council under this section must 
be deposited in an appropriate account in the name of the Council 
specified in its charter. Funds eligible to be collected or received by 
a Council must be limited to those authorized under the Act.
    (a) Pending disbursement, under an approved marketing plan and 
budget, funds collected through assessments authorized by the Act must 
be deposited in any interest-bearing account or certificate of deposit 
of a bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System, or in 
obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United 
States Government.
    (b) The Council may, however, pending disbursement of these funds, 
invest in risk-free, short-term, interest-bearing instruments.
    (1) Risk-free. All investments must be insured or fully 
collateralized with Federal Government securities. In the absence of 
collateral, accounts established at financial institutions should, in 
aggregate, total less than $100,000 to assure both principal and 
interest are federally insured in full.
    (2) Short-term. Generally, all investments should be for a 
relatively short time period (one year or less) to assure that the 
principal is maintained and readily convertible to cash.
    (3) Collateralization. Investments exceeding the $100,000 insurance 
coverage level must be fully collateralized by the financial 
institution.
    (i) Collateral must be pledged at face value and must be pledged 
prior to sending funds to the institution.
    (ii) Government securities are acceptable collateral. Declining 
balance, mortgage backed securities such as Government National Mortgage 
Association (GNMA) and Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) are 
not acceptable collateral.
    (iii) If an account has been established, collateral may be held at 
the local Federal Reserve Bank. Otherwise, another depository must hold 
the collateral.


<R05>
Sec. 270.17  Authority to impose assessments.

    A Council will impose and administer the collection of the 
assessments that are necessary to pay for all expenses incurred by the 
Council in carrying out its functions under 50 CFR part 270.


<R05>
Sec. 270.18  Method of imposing assessments.

    Assessments will be imposed on sector participants in the receiving 
sector or the importing sector or both as specified in an approved 
Council charter. Assessment rates will be based on value that may be 
expressed in monetary units or units of weight or volume.
    (a) An assessment on sector participants in the receiving sector 
will be in the form of a percentage of the value or a fixed amount per 
unit of weight or volume of the fish described in the charter when 
purchased by such receivers from fish harvesters.
    (b) An assessment on sector participants who own fish processing 
vessels and harvest the fish described in the charter will be in the 
form of a percentage of the value or on a fixed amount per unit of 
weight or volume of the fish described in the charter that is no less 
than the value if such fish had been purchased by a receiver other than 
the owner of the harvesting vessel.
    (c) An assessment on sector participants in the importing sector 
will be in the form of a percentage of the value that an importer pays 
to a foreign supplier, as determined for the purposes of the customs 
laws, or a fixed amount per unit of weight or volume, of the fish or 
fish products described in the charter when entered or withdrawn from 
warehouse for consumption, in the customs territory of the United States 
by such sector participants.
    (d) A Council may not impose an assessment on any person that was 
not eligible to vote in the referendum establishing the Council by 
reason of failure to meet the requirements specified under unless that 
person, after the date on which the referendum is held, meets the 
requirements of section.

[[Page 757]]

    (e) Any person may make voluntary payments or in-kind contributions 
to a Council for purposes of assisting the Council in carrying out its 
functions.


<R05>
Sec. 270.19  Notice of assessment.

    (a) The Council must serve each person subject to assessment with 
notice that the assessment is due. The notice of assessment must 
contain:
    (1) A specific reference to the provisions of the Act, regulations, 
charter and referendum that authorize the assessment;
    (2) The amount of the assessment;
    (3) The period of time covered by the assessment;
    (4) The date the assessment is due and payable, which will not be 
earlier than 30 days from the date of the notice;

    (6) To whom and where the payment must be made.
    (b) The notice must advise such person of his or her right to seek 
review of the assessment by filing a written petition of objection with 
NMFS at any time during the time period to which the assessment applies, 
including the right to request a hearing on the petition. The notice 
must state that the petition of objection must be filed in accordance 
with the procedures in Sec. 270.21.
    (c) The notice must also advise such persons of his or her right to 
a refund of the assessment as provided in Sec. 270.22. The notice must 
state that a refund may be requested for not less than 90 days from such 
collection, and provide that the Council will make the refund within 60 
days after the request for the refund is requested.


<R05>
Sec. 270.20  Payment of assessments.

    Persons subject to an assessment would be required to pay the 
assessment on or before the date due, unless they have demanded a refund 
or filed a petition of objection with NMFS under Sec. 270.21. However, 
persons who have demanded a refund under Sec. 270.22 or filed a 
petition of objection under Sec. 270.21 may submit proof of these 
actions in leu of payment. In the case of a petition of objection, NMFs 
will inform the Council and the petitioner of its finding at which time 
petitioner must pay the revised assessment if applicable.


<R05>
Sec. 270.21  Petition of objection.

    (a) Filing a petition. Any person issued a notice of assessment 
under Sec. 270.19 may request that NMFS modify or take other 
appropriate action regarding the assessment or promotion plan by filing 
a written petition of objection with NMFS. Petitions of objection may be 
filed:
    (1) Only if the petitioner determines one or more of the following 
criteria is not in accordance with the law:
    (i) The assessment;
    (ii) The plan upon which the assessment is based; or
    (iii) Any obligation imposed on the petitioner under the plan.
    (2) Only during the time period to which the assessment applies.
    (b) Contents of the petition of objection. A petition must be 
addressed to Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, National Marine 
Fisheries Service, 1315 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910, and 
must contain the following:
    (1) The petitioner's correct name, address, and principal place of 
business. If the petitioner is a corporation, this must be stated, 
together with the date and state of incorporation, and the names, 
addresses, and respective positions of its officers; if a partnership, 
the date and place of formation and the name and address of each 
partner;
    (2) The grounds upon which the petition of objection is based, 
including the specific terms or provisions of the assessment, the 
marketing and promotion plan, or obligation imposed by the plan, to 
which the petitioner objects;
    (3) A full statement of the facts upon which the petition is based, 
set forth clearly and concisely, accompanied by any supporting 
documentation;
    (4) The specific relief requested; and
    (5) A statement as to whether or not the petitioner requests a 
hearing.
    (c) Notice to Council. NMFS will promptly furnish the appropriate 
Council with a copy of the petition of objection.

[[Page 758]]

    (d) Opportunity for informal hearing. (1) Any person filing a 
petition of objection may request an informal hearing on the petition. 
The hearing request must be submitted with the petition of objection.
    (2) If a request for hearing is timely filed, or if NMFS determines 
that a hearing is advisable, NMFS will so notify the petitioner and the 
Council. NMFS will establish the applicable procedures, and designate 
who will be responsible for conducting a hearing. The petitioner, the 
Council, and any other interested party, may appear at the hearing in 
person or through a representative, and may submit any relevant 
materials, data, comments, arguments, or exhibits. NMFS may consolidate 
two or more hearing requests into a single proceeding.
    (3) Final decision. Following the hearing, or if no hearing is held, 
as soon as practicable, NMFS will decide the matter and serve written 
notice of the decision on the petitioner and the Council. NMFS's 
decision will be based on a consideration of all relevant documentation 
and other evidence submitted, and will constitute the final 
administrative decision and order of the agency. NMFS will have the 
discretion to waive collection of a contested assessment or revise, 
modify, or alter the assessment amount based on a Council method of 
assessment.


<R05>
Sec. 270.22  Refunds.

    (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Act, any person who 
pays an assessment under the Act may demand and must promptly receive 
from the Council a refund of such assessment. A demand for refund must 
be made in accordance with procedures in the approved charter and within 
such time as will be prescribed by the Council and approved by NMFS. 
Procedures to provide such a refund must be established before any such 
assessment may be collected. Such procedures must allow any person to 
request a refund 90 days or more from such collection, and provide that 
such refund must be made within 60 days after demand for such refund is 
made.
    (b) Once a refund has been requested by a sector participant and 
paid by the Council, that sector participant may no longer participate 
in a referendum or other business of the Council during the remainder of 
the assessment rate period. Future assessments will only be sent to such 
a sector participant at the request of the sector participant. If 
assessments are paid during a future assessment rate period and no 
refund is requested, that sector participant may again participate in a 
referendum or other business of the Council.


<R05>
Sec. 270.23  Dissolution of Councils.

    (a) Petition for termination. (1) A petition to terminate a Council 
may be filed with NMFS by no less than three sector participants in any 
one sector. Any petition filed under this subsection must be accompanied 
by a written document explaining the reasons for such petition.
    (2) If NMFS determines that a petition filed under paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section is accompanied by the signatures, or corporate 
certifications, of no less than three sector participants in the sector 
referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section who collectively 
accounted for, in the 12-month period immediately preceding the month in 
which the petition was filed, not less than 20 percent of the value of 
the fish or fish products described in Sec. 270.3(c)(2)(iii) that were 
handled by that sector during the period, NMFS within 90 days after the 
determination, will conduct a referendum for termination of the Council 
among all sector participants in that sector.
    (3) Not less than 30 days prior to holding a referendum, NMFS will 
publish an announcement in the Federal Register of the referendum, 
including an explanation of the reasons for the petition for termination 
filed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section and any other relevant 
information NMFS considers appropriate.
    (4) If the referendum votes which are cast in favor of terminating 
the Council constitute a majority of the sector participants voting and 
the majority, in the period in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, 
collectively accounted for not less than 66 percent of the value of such 
fish and fish products that were handled during such period by the 
sector in paragraph (a)(1) of this section,

[[Page 759]]

NMFS will by order of publication terminate the Council effective as of 
a date by which the affairs of the Council may be concluded on an 
orderly basis.
    (5) NMFS initially will pay all costs of a referendum conducted in 
Sec. 270.23. Prior to conducting such a referendum, NMFS will require 
petitioners to post a bond or other security acceptable to NMFS in an 
amount which NMFS determines to be sufficient to pay any expenses 
incurred for the conduct of the referendum.
    (6) If a referendum conducted under Sec. 270.23 fails to result in 
the termination of the Council, NMFS will immediately recover the amount 
of the bond posted by the petitioners under Sec. 270.23(a)(5).
    (7) If a referendum conducted under this subsection results in the 
termination of the Council, NMFS will recover the expenses incurred for 
the conduct of the referendum from the account established by the 
Council. If the amount remaining in such account is insufficient for 
NMFS to recover all expenses incurred for the conduct of the referendum, 
NMFS will recover the balance of the expenses from the petitioners that 
posted a bond under paragraph (a)(5) of this section.
    (b) Payment of remaining funds. If a Council is terminated under 
section Sec. 270.23(a)(4), NMFS, after recovering all expenses incurred 
for the conduct of the referendum under paragraph (a) of this section, 
will take such action as is necessary and practicable to ensure that 
moneys remaining in the account established by the Council under Sec. 
270.17 are paid on a prorated basis to the sector participants from whom 
those moneys were collected under Sec. 270.20.

fiscal year limitation as a revolving fund to carry out the purposes of 
title IV of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Amendments of 1978, as 
amended.
    (b) Payments into the fund. Each Holder of an exploration permit, 
lease, easement, or rights-of-way for the construction of a pipeline, or 
a prelease exploration drilling permit issued or maintained under the 
Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, in effect on or after June 30, 1982, 
shall pay assessments to the Fund. All pipeline right-of-way and 
easements are to be included for assessment except those constructed and 
operated lines within the confines of a single lease or group of 
contiguous leases under unitized operation or single operator. Payments 
will not be required for geological or geophysical permits, other than 
prelease exploratory drilling permits issued under section 11 of the 
Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1340).
    (1) Assessments to maintain the fund. When the total amount in the 
Fund is less than the Chief, FSD, determines is needed to pay Fund 
claims and expenses, the Chief, FSD, will notify the Secretary of the 
Interior that additional assessments are needed.
    (2) Billing and collections. The Secretary of the Interior will 
calculate the amounts to be paid by each Holder and shall notify each 
Holder of the dollar amount and the time and place for all payments. 
Each assessment shall be paid to the Secretary of the Interior no later 
than 45 days after the Secretary of the Interior sends notice of the 
assessment.
    (3) Annual assessment limits. No Holder shall be required to pay in 
excess of $5,000 for any lease, permit, easement or right-of-way in any 
calendar year.
    (c) Moneys recovered through subrogation. Any moneys recovered by 
the Secretary through the subrogation of a claimant's rights shall be 
deposited into the Fund.
    (d) Investments of the fund. Excess sums in the Fund will be 
invested in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States. Revenue 
from such investments shall be deposited in the Fund.
    (e) Litigation. The Fund may sue and be sued in its own name.


<R05>
Sec. 296.4  Claims eligible for compensation.

    (a) Claimants. Damage or loss eligible for Fund compensation must be 
suffered by a commercial fisherman.
    (b) Damage or loss of fishing gear. Damage or loss is eligible for 
Fund compensation if it was caused by materials, equipment, tools, 
containers, or other items associated with OCS oil and gas exploration, 
development, or production activities. Damage or loss

[[Page 762]]

may be eligible for compensation even though it did not occur in OCS 
waters if the item causing the damage or loss was associated with oil 
and gas exploration, development, or production activities in OCS 
waters.
    (c) Exceptions. Damage or loss is not eligible for Fund 
compensation:
    (1) If the damage or loss was caused by the negligence or fault of 
the claimant;
    (2) If the damage or loss occurred prior to September 18, 1978;
    (3) To the extent that damage or loss exceeds the replacement value 
of the fishing gear involved;
    (4) For any portion of the damage or loss which can be compensated 
by insurance;
    (5) If the claim is not filed within 90 calendar days of the date 
the claimant or the claimant's agent first became aware of the damage or 
loss (or such longer period as the Secretary may allow under unusual and 
extenuating circumstances); or
    (6) If the damage or loss was caused by an obstruction unrelated to 
OCS oil and gas exploration, development, or production activities.

[47 FR 49600, Nov. 1, 1982, as amended at 50 FR 13796, Apr. 8, 1985; 61 
FR 6322, Feb. 20, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 296.5  Instructions for filing claims.

    (a) Fifteen-day report required to gain presumption of causation--
(1) General. Damages or losses are presumed to be qualified for 
compensation if certain requirements are satisfied. One requirement is 
that a report must be made to NMFS within fifteen (15) days after the 
date on which the vessel first returns to a port after discovering the 
damage or loss. Filing of a fifteen-day report must be followed up by 
filing a detailed claim.
    (2) When and how to file a fifteen-day report. To qualify for the 
presumption of causation, a fifteen-day report must be made to NMFS 
within fifteen days after the date on which the vessel first returns to 
a port after discovering the damage or loss. Satisfaction of the 
fifteen-day requirement is determined by the postmark, if the report is 
mailed; by the date of a call, if the report is telephoned or 
radiotelephoned; or, by the date of appearance, if the report is made in 
person. The fifteen-day report must be made to the Chief, Financial 
Services Division, National Marine Fisheries Service, 1315 East-West 
Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910; telephone: (301) 713-2396.
    (3) Contents of fifteen-day report. Each fifteen-day report must 
include the following information:
    (i) The claimant's name and address;
    (ii) The name of the commercial fishing vessel involved;
    (iii) The location of the obstruction which caused the damage or 
loss;
    (iv) A description of the nature of the damage or loss;
    (v) The date such damage or loss was discovered;
    (vi) If the fifteen-day report is made after the vessel returns to 
port, the date on which the vessel first returned to port after 
discovering the damage.
    (b) Form of claim. Claims must be in writing. Claims may be 
submitted on NOAA form 88-164. This form may be obtained from any NMFS 
regional office or from the Chief, FSD. Although claimants are not 
required to use this claim form, it will probably be to their benefit to 
do so.
    (c) Who must file and when and where to file claims. All claimants 
(including those who filed 15-day reports to gain the presumption of 
causation) must submit a claim application to the Chief, Financial 
Services Division, within 90 calendar days of the date the claimant or 
the claimant's agent first became aware of the damage or loss. The 
Chief, FSD, may allow a longer period for filing claims if, in his 
discretion, unusual and extenuating circumstances justify a longer 
period. The term ``filed'' means delivered in person, or mailed (as 
determined by the date of the postmark) to the Chief, Financial Services 
Division, National Marine Fisheries Service, 1825 Connecticut Avenue, 
NW., Washington, DC 20235. The Chief, FSD, suggests that mailed claims 
be sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, so 
the claimant will have a record that the claim was received by the 
Chief, FSD.
    (d) Aggregating claims. If more than one commercial fisherman 
suffers loss or damage from the same incident (for example, when several 
members of the

[[Page 763]]

crew lost income due to loss of fishing time), all claims should be 
submitted on their behalf by the owner or operator of the commercial 
fishing vessel involved.
    (e) Contents of claim. Each claim must be signed by the claimant and 
must accurately and completely provide the following information:
    (1) The name, mailing address, telephone number, citizenship, and 
occupational status (for example, vessel owner, operator, or crew 
member) of each claimant;
    (2) The name and Coast Guard documentation number or State 
registration number of the commercial fishing vessel involved in the 
damage or loss;
    (3) The home port, type, and size of the vessel involved in the

description of both the deployment of any fishing gear which is the 
subject of the claim and all attempts at retrieval of the gear),
    (iv) The names and addresses of all witnesses to the casualty,
    (v) The location where the casualty occurred in Loran C coordinates 
or the next most accurate method of position fixing available to the

recovered) which caused the casualty, and whether or not any surface 
markers were attached to or near the obstruction. Submit any available 
photographs of the item or obstruction. State reasons for believing the 
obstruction is associated with OCS oil and gas activities.
    (5) The amount claimed for property damage or loss and a full 
statement of the type and extent of damage or loss including:
    (i) An inventory of all components of fishing gear damaged or lost,
    (ii) The date, place, and cost of acquisition of all fishing gear 
damaged or lost and proof of its purchase (sales receipts, affidavits,

company of the present replacement or repair (whichever applies) cost of 
the damaged or lost fishing gear. If the gear will be repaired by the 
claimant himself, a detailed estimate by the claimant identifying the 
repair cost.
    (6) The amount claimed for economic loss and the basis for that 
amount with supporting documentation, as follows:
    (i) Trip tickets for the three vessel trips immediately before the 
trip during which the casualty was discovered and for the vessel trip 
immediately following the trip during which the casualty occurred.
    (ii) A statement of the amount of time involved on each of the 
vessel trips above (or if the casualty involves fixed gear, a statement 
of the number of gear units deployed on each of these trips).
    (iii) A statement of the amount of time lost from fishing because of 
the damage or loss and a full explanation of why this time period is 
reasonable.
    (iv) Documentation of the date replacement gear was ordered and 
received or the date gear repair began and ended. This documentation may 
consist of purchase orders, bills of lading, or statements from sellers 
or repairers.
    (7) The amount claimed for other consequential loss or costs 
(including fees for claim preparation, etc.) with suitable documentation 
of the amounts claimed (such as invoices, receipts, etc.).

<R05>
Sec. 296.6  NMFS processing of claims.

    (a) Action by NMFS. Upon receipt of a claim, the Chief, FSD, will:
    (1) Send an abstract of the claim to the Secretary of the Interior;
    (2) Send the reported location of any obstruction which was not 
recovered and retained to the National Ocean Survey, which will inform 
the Defense Mapping Agency Hydrographic/Topographic Center.
    (b) Actions by the Interior Department. Upon receipt of an abstract 
of a claim,

[[Page 764]]

the Interior Department will immediately:
    (1) Plot the casualty site, and advise NMFS whether the site is in 
an area affected by OCS activities;
    (2) make reasonable efforts to notify all persons known to have 
engaged in activities associated with OCS energy activity in the 
vicinity where the damage or loss occurred.
    (c) Responses to notice of claim. (1) Each person notified by the 
Interior Department will, within thirty days after receipt of the 
notice, advise the Chief, FSD, and the Interior Department whether he 
admits or denies responsibility for the damages claimed.
    (2) Each person notified by the Interior Department who fails to 
give timely and proper advice of admission or denial of responsibility 
shall be presumed to deny responsibility for the damages claimed.
    (3) If any person admits responsibility, the Chief, FSD, will 
initiate action to recover from that party any sums paid or to be paid 
for the claimed damages.
    (4) Any person referred to in this section, including lessees or 
permittees or their contractors or subcontractors, may submit evidence 
about any claim to the Chief, FSD.
    (d) Failure to meet filing requirements. The Chief, FSD, may reject 
any claim that does not meet the filing requirements. The Chief, FSD, 
will give a claimant whose claim is rejected written notice of the 
reasons for rejection within 30 days after the date on which the claim 
was filed. If the claimant does not refile an acceptable claim within 30 
days after the date of this written notice, the claimant is not eligible 
for Fund compensation unless there are extenuating circumstances.
    (e) Proceedings--(1) Location. Any required proceeding will be 
conducted within such United States judicial district as may be mutually 
agreeable to the claimant and the Assistant Administrator, NMFS, or his 
designee, or if no agreement can be reached, within the United States 
judicial district in which the claimant's home port is located.
    (2) Powers. For purposes of any proceeding, the Assistant 
Administrator, NMFS, or his designee, shall have the power to administer 
oaths and subpoena witnesses and the production of books, records, and 
other evidence relative to the issues involved.
    (3) Amendments to claims. A claimant may amend the claim at any time 
before the Chief, FSD, issues an initial determination.
    (4) Criminal penalty for fraudulent claims. Any person who files a 
fraudulent claim is subject to prosecution under 18 U.S.C. sections 287 
and 1001, each of which, upon conviction, imposes a penalty of not more 
than a $10,000 fine and 5 years' imprisonment, or both.

[47 FR 49600, Nov. 1, 1982, as amended at 61 FR 6322, Feb. 20, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 296.7  Burden of proof and presumption of causation.

    (a) Burden of proof. The claimant has the burden to establish, by a 
preponderance of the evidence, all facts necessary to qualify his claim, 
including:
    (1) The identity or nature of the item which caused the damage or 
loss; and
    (2) That the item is associated with oil and gas exploration, 
development, or production activities on the Outer Continental Shelf.
    (b) Presumption of causation. Notwithstanding the above, damages or 
losses are presumed to be caused by items associated with oil and gas 
exploration, development, or production activities on the OCS if the 
claimant establishes that:
    (1) The claimant's commercial fishing vessel was being used for 
commercial fishing and was located in an area affected by OCS oil and 
gas exploration, development, or production activities;
    (2) A report on the location of the obstruction which caused such 
damage or loss, and the nature of such damage or loss, was made within 
fifteen days after the date on which the vessel first returned to a port 
after discovering such damage;
    (3) There was no record on the most recent nautical charts issued by 
the National Ocean Survey, NOAA, or in any weekly Notice to Mariners 
issued by the Defense Mapping Agency Hydrographic/Topographic Center, in 
effect at least 15 days before the date the

[[Page 765]]

damage or loss occurred, then an obstruction existed in the immediate 
vicinity where the damage or loss occurred. In the case of damages 
caused by a pipeline, the presumption will be available regardless of 
whether the pipeline was recorded on charts or in the Notice to 
Mariners; and
    (4) There was no proper surface marker or lighted buoy attached, or 
closely anchored, to such obstruction.
    (c) Geographic exclusion from presumption of causation. Damage or 
loss occurring within a one-quarter mile radius of obstructions recorded 
on charts or in a Notice to Mariners, or properly marked, is presumed to 
involve the recorded or marked obstruction.


<R05>
Sec. 296.8  Amount of award.

    (a) Actual damages. The award for damaged fishing gear will be the 
lesser of the gear's repair cost or replacement cost. The award for lost 
fishing gear will be the gear's replacement cost.
    (b) Consequential damages. An award may also include compensation 
for any damage or loss (except personal injury) that is incurred as a 
consequence of the fishing gear damage or loss.
    (c) Resulting economic loss. An award may also include 50 percent of 
the resulting economic loss from damage to or loss of fishing vessels 
and gear.
    (d) Attorney, CPA, consultant fees. An award may also include 
compensation for reasonable fees paid by the claimant to an attorney, 
CPA, or other consultant for the preparation or prosecution of a claim.
    (e) Negligence of claimant. (1) An award will be reduced to the 
extent that the loss or damage was caused by the negligence or fault of 
the claimant. (For example, a claimant who sustained $10,000 in damages 
and whose negligence or fault was found to be responsible for 40% of the 
damage would receive $6,000 in compensation. If the same claimant were 
responsible for 99% of the negligence or fault that caused the damage, 
the claimant would receive $100 in compensation).
    (2) Negligence of the owner or operator of the fishing vessel or 
gear will reduce crewmember awards to the same extent that it reduces an 
award to the vessel's owner or operator.
    (f) Insurance proceeds. An award will be reduced by the amount the 
claimant has, or reasonably would have, received under a commercial 
policy of full hull and machinery and protection and indemnity 
insurance, whether or not such insurance was in effect at the time the 
casualty occurred.

<R05>
Sec. 296.10  Agency review.

Assistant Administrator, NMFS, or his designee, for a review of the 
initial determination.
    (b) The petitioner may submit written or oral evidence within 30 
days of filing the petition for review.


<R05>
Sec. 296.11  Final determination.

within 30 days after the date the Chief, FSD, issues an initial 
determination, the Assistant Administrator, NMFS, or his designee will 
conduct a review of the initial determination, and will issue a final 
determination no later than 60 days after receipt of the request for 
review of the initial determination.
    (b) If a petition for review of an initial determination is not 
filed within 30 days after the day on which the Chief, FSD, issues an 
initial determination, the initial determination will become a final 
determination.


<R05>
Sec. 296.12  Payment of costs.

    (a) By person denying responsibility for damage. Any person who is 
notified by the Interior Department and fails to

[[Page 766]]

respond or denies responsibility for the damages claimed will pay the 
costs of the proceedings if such person is subsequently found to be 
responsible for the damage claimed.
    (b) By the claimant. Any claimant who files a claim will pay the 
cost of the proceedings if such person is subsequently found to be 
responsible for the damage claimed.
    (c) By person denying responsibility for damage and the claimant. If 
more than one party is found to have responsibility for the damage 
claimed, then the cost of the proceedings will be apportioned between 
them.


<R05>
Sec. 296.13  Payment of award for claim.

    (a) Upon an initial determination, the Chief, Financial Services 
Division, shall immediately disburse the claim awarded if the claimant 
signed as part of his/her application a statement agreeing to repay all 
or any part of the award if the award should for any reason be 
subsequently reduced.
    (b) [Reserved]

[61 FR 6322, Feb. 20, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 296.14  Subrogation.

    (a) The claim application will contain a subrogation statement 
signed by the claimant as a condition of payment of the claim which:
    (1) Assigns to the Fund the claimant's rights against third parties; 
and
    (2) Provides that the claimant will assist the Fund in any 
reasonable way to pursue those rights.

part.
    (e) Refuse to allow an authorized officer to inspect any report or 
record required to be made or kept under this part.
    (f) Falsify, cover, or otherwise obscure, the name, home port, 
official number (if any), or any other similar marking or identification 
of any fishing vessel subject to this part such that the vessel cannot 
be readily identified from an enforcement vessel or aircraft.
    (g) Fail to comply immediately with any of the enforcement and 
boarding procedures specified in this part.
    (h) Refuse to allow an authorized officer to board a fishing vessel, 
or enter any other area of custody (i.e., any vessel, building, vehicle, 
live car, pound, pier, or dock facility where fish might be found) 
subject to such person's control, for the purpose of conducting any 
inspection, search, seizure, investigation, or arrest in connection with 
the enforcement of this part or any other applicable law.
    (i) Destroy, stave, or dispose of in any manner, any fish, gear, 
cargo, or other matter, upon any communication or signal from an

    (q) Attempt to do any of the foregoing.


<R05>
Sec. 300.5  Facilitation of enforcement.

    (a) Compliance. The operator of, or any other person aboard, any 
fishing vessel subject to this part must immediately comply with 
instructions and signals issued by an authorized officer or CCAMLR 
inspector to stop the vessel, and with instructions to facilitate safe 
boarding and inspection of the vessel, its gear, equipment, fishing 
record (where applicable), and catch for purposes of enforcing this 
part.
    (b) Communications. (1) Upon being approached by a USCG vessel or 
aircraft, or other vessel or aircraft with an authorized officer or 
CCAMLR inspector aboard, the operator of a fishing vessel must be alert 
for communications conveying enforcement instructions.
    (2) VHF-FM radiotelephone is the preferred method of communicating 
between vessels. If the size of the vessel and the wind, sea, and 
visibility conditions allow, a loudhailer may be used instead of the 
radio. Hand signals, placards, high frequency radiotelephone, voice, 
flags, whistle or horn may be employed by an authorized officer or 
CCAMLR inspector, and message blocks may be dropped from an aircraft.
    (3) If other communications are not practicable, visual signals may 
be transmitted by flashing light directed at the vessel signaled. USCG 
units will normally use the flashing light signal ``L'' which, in the 
International Code of Signals, means ``you should stop your vessel 
instantly.''
    (4) Failure of a vessel's operator promptly to stop the vessel when 
directed to do so by an authorized officer or CCAMLR inspector, or by an 
enforcement vessel or aircraft, using loudhailer, radiotelephone, 
flashing light, flags, whistle, horn or other means constitutes prima 
facie evidence of the offense of refusal to allow an authorized officer 
or CCAMLR inspector to board.
    (5) A person aboard a vessel who does not understand a signal from 
an enforcement unit and who is unable to obtain clarification by 
loudhailer or radiotelephone must consider the signal to be a command to 
stop the vessel immediately.
    (c) Boarding. The operator of a vessel directed to stop must:
    (1) Monitor Channel 16, VHF-FM, if so equipped.
    (2) Stop immediately and lay to or, if appropriate and/or directed 
to do so by the authorized officer or CCAMLR inspector, maneuver in such 
a way as to allow the safe boarding of the vessel by the authorized 
officer or CCAMLR inspector and the boarding party.
    (3) Except for those vessels with a freeboard of 4 ft (1.25 m) or 
less, provide a safe ladder, if needed, for the authorized officer or 
CCAMLR inspector and boarding party to come aboard.
    (4) When necessary to facilitate the boarding or when requested by 
an authorized officer or CCAMLR inspector, provide a manrope or safety 
line, and illumination for the ladder.
    (5) Take such other actions as necessary to facilitate boarding and 
to ensure the safety of the authorized officer or CCAMLR inspector and 
the boarding party.
    (d) Signals. The following signals, extracted from the International 
Code of Signals, may be sent by flashing light by an enforcement unit 
when conditions do not allow communications by loudhailer or 
radiotelephone. Knowledge of these signals by vessel operators is not 
required. However, knowledge of these signals and appropriate action by 
a vessel operator may preclude the necessity of sending the signal ``L'' 
and the necessity for the vessel to stop instantly.
    (1) ``AA'' repeated (.- .-) is the call to an unknown station. The 
operator of the signaled vessel should respond by identifying the vessel 
by radiotelephone or by illuminating the vessel's identification.
    (2) ``RY-CY'' (.-. -.-- -.-. -.--) means ``you should proceed at 
slow speed, a boat is coming to you.'' This signal is normally employed 
when conditions allow an enforcement boarding without the necessity of 
the vessel being boarded coming to a complete stop, or,

[[Page 774]]

in some cases, without retrieval of fishing gear that may be in the 
water.
    (3) ``SQ3'' (... --.- ...--) means ``you should stop or heave to; I 
am going to board you.''

                      Subpart B_High Seas Fisheries

    Authority: 16 U.S.C. 5501 et seq.


<R05>
Sec. 300.10  Purpose.

    This subpart implements the High Seas Fishing Compliance Act of 1995 
(Act), which requires the Secretary to license U.S. vessels fishing on 
the high seas.


<R05>
Sec. 300.11  Definitions.

    In addition to the terms defined in section 300.2 and those in the 
Act and the Agreement to Promote Compliance with International 
Conservation and Management Measures by Fishing Vessels on the High 
Seas, adopted by the Conference of the Food and Agriculture Organization 
of the United Nations on November 24, 1993 (Agreement), the terms used 
in this subpart have the following meanings. If a term is defined 
differently in Sec. 300.2, the Act, or the Agreement, the definition in 
this section shall apply.
    High seas means the waters beyond the territorial sea or exclusive 
economic zone (or the equivalent) of any Nation, to the extent that such 
territorial sea or exclusive economic zone (or the equivalent) is 
recognized by the United States.
    High seas fishing vessel means any vessel of the United States used 
or intended for use on the high seas for the purpose of the commercial 
exploitation of living marine resources as a harvesting vessel, 
mothership, or any other support vessel directly engaged in a fishing 
operation.
    International conservation and management measures means measures to 
conserve or manage one or more species of living marine resources that 
are adopted and applied in accordance with the relevant rules of 
international law, as reflected in the 1982 United Nations Convention on 
the Law of the Sea, and that are recognized by the United States.
    Regional Administrator means any one of the Directors of the five 
NMFS regional offices, defined under Sec. 300.2, serving as the issuing 
office.


<R05>
Sec. 300.12  Issuing offices.

    Any Regional Administrator may issue permits required under this 
subpart. While applicants for permits may submit an application to any 
Regional Administrator, applicants are encouraged to submit their 
applications (with envelopes marked ``Attn: HSFCA Permits'') to the 
Regional Administrator with whom they normally interact on fisheries 
matters.


<R05>
Sec. 300.13  Vessel permits.

    (a) Eligibility. (1) Any high seas fishing vessel of the United 
States is eligible to receive a permit under this subpart, unless the 
vessel was previously authorized to be used for fishing on the high seas 
by a foreign nation, and--
    (i) The foreign nation suspended such authorization, because the 
vessel undermined the effectiveness of international conservation and 
management measures, and the suspension has not expired; or
    (ii) The foreign nation, within the 3 years preceding application 
for a permit under this section, withdrew such authorization, because 
the vessel undermined the effectiveness of international conservation 
and management measures.
    (2) The restrictions in paragraphs (a)(1) (i) and (ii) of this 
section do not apply if ownership of the vessel has changed since the 
vessel undermined the effectiveness of international conservation and 
management measures, and the new owner has provided sufficient evidence 
to the Regional Administrator demonstrating that the owner and operator 
at the time the vessel undermined the effectiveness of such measures has 
no further legal, beneficial, or financial interest in, or control of, 
the vessel.
    (3) The restrictions in paragraphs (a)(1) (i) and (ii) of this 
section do not apply if it is determined by the Regional Administrator 
that issuing a permit would not subvert the purposes of the Agreement.
    (b) Application forms. The owner or operator of a high seas fishing 
vessel may apply for a permit under this subpart by completing an 
application

[[Page 775]]

form. Applicants may obtain an application form from a Regional 
Administrator.
    (c) Application information. An applicant must submit a complete and 
accurate permit application, signed by the owner or operator, to the 
appropriate Regional Administrator.
    (d) Fees. NMFS will charge a fee to recover the administrative 
expenses of permit issuance. The amount of the fee will be determined in 
accordance with the procedures of the NOAA Finance Handbook, available 
from a Regional Administrator, for determining administrative costs of 
each special product or service. The fee is specified with the 
application form. The appropriate fee must accompany each application. 
Failure to pay the fee will preclude issuance of the permit. Payment by 
a commercial instrument later determined to be insufficiently funded 
will invalidate any permit.
    (e) Issuance. (1) Except as provided in subpart D of 15 CFR part 
904, the Regional Administrator will issue a permit, which will include 
appropriate conditions or restrictions, within 30 days of receipt of a 
completed application and payment of the appropriate fee.
    (2) The Regional Administrator will notify the applicant of any 
deficiency in the application.
    (f) Validity. Permits issued under this subpart are valid for 5 
years from the date of issuance. Renewal of a permit prior to its 
expiration is the responsibility of the permit holder. For a permit to 
remain valid to its expiration date, the vessel's USCG documentation or 
state registration must be kept current. A permit issued under this 
subpart is void when the name of the owner or vessel changes, or in the 
event the vessel is no longer eligible for U.S. documentation, such 
documentation is revoked or denied, or the vessel is removed from such 
documentation.
    (g) Change in application information. Any changes in vessel 
documentation status or other permit application information must be 
reported to the Regional Administrator in writing within 15 days of such 
changes.
    (h) Transfer. A permit issued under this subpart is not transferable 
or assignable to another vessel or owner; it is valid only for the 
vessel and owner to which it is issued.
    (i) Display. A valid permit, or a copy thereof, issued under this 
subpart must be on board the vessel while operating on the high seas and 
available for inspection by an authorized officer. Faxed copies of 
permits are acceptable.

vessel or vessels does not exceed that of the vessel or vessels being 
replaced.
    (3) Vessel information. The owner of any fishing vessel that uses 
purse seine, longline, drift gillnet, harpoon, or troll fishing gear to 
harvest tuna in the Convention Area for sale or a person authorized in 
writing to serve as agent for the owner must provide such information 
about the vessel and its characteristics as requested by the Regional 
Administrator, to conform to IATTC actions relative to the Vessel 
Register. This information initially includes, but is not limited to, 
vessel name and registration number; a photograph of the vessel with the 
registration number showing and legible; vessel length, beam and moulded 
depth; gross tonnage and hold capacity in cubic meters and tonnage; 
engine horsepower; date and place where built; and type of fishing 
method or methods used.
    (4) Vessel register status. For a vessel to be categorized as either 
``active'' or ``inactive'' on the Vessel Register in the following 
calendar year, the vessel owner or managing owner must submit to the 
Regional Administrator under Sec. 216.24(b) of this title, the observer 
placement fee, vessel permit application, and permit application 
processing fee for the vessel.
    (i) Active status. As early as August 1 of each year, vessel owners 
or managing owners may submit to the Regional Administrator, a vessel 
permit application and payment of the permit application fee and 
observer placement fee for each vessel in excess of 400 st (362.8 mt) 
carrying capacity qualified to be listed on the Vessel Register under 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section to have a vessel categorized as active

[[Page 779]]

for the following calendar year. Vessel permit applications may not be 
submitted via regular mail; they must be faxed to (562) 980-4027. Owners 
or managing owners of vessels of 400 st (362.8 mt) carrying capacity or 
less must only submit payment of the observer placement fee associated 
with active status in order to request a small purse seine vessel be 
categorized as active for the following calendar year. The Regional 
Administrator must receive the faxed vessel permit application and 
payment of the observer placement fee and permit application processing 
fee no later than September 15 for vessels for which a DML was requested 
for the following year and no later than November 30 for vessels for 
which a DML was not requested for the following year. Submission of the 
vessel permit application and payment of the observer placement fee and 
permit application processing fee will be interpreted by the Regional 
Administrator as a request for a vessel to be categorized as active. The 
following restrictions apply to active status:
    (A) The cumulative carrying capacity of all vessels categorized as 
active on the Vessel Register may not exceed 8,969 mt in a given year;
    (B) A vessel may not be added to active status on the Vessel 
Register unless the captain of the vessel has obtained a valid operator 
permit under Sec. 216.24(b)(2) of this title;
    (C) For 2005 only, requests for vessels will be prioritized on a 
first-come, first-served basis according to the date and time the fax is 
received in the office of the Regional Administrator;
    (D) Requests for active status for 2006 and subsequent years will be 
prioritized according to the following hierarchy:
    (1) Requests received for vessels that were categorized as active in 
the previous year, beginning with the vessel's status in 2005, unless 
the request for active status was determined to be frivolous by the 
Regional Administrator under paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section;
    (2) Requests received for vessels that were categorized as inactive 
under paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section in the previous year, 
beginning with the vessel's status in 2005;
    (3) Requests for vessels not described in paragraphs (b)(4)(D)(1) or 
(2) of this section will be prioritized on a first-come, first-served 
basis according to the date and time stamp printed by the incoming fax 
machine upon receipt, provided that the associated observer placement 
fee is paid by the applicable deadline described in Sec. 
216.24(b)(6)(iii) of this title; and
    (4) Requests received from owners or managing owners of vessels that 
were determined, by the Regional Administrator, to have made a frivolous 
request for active status under paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section.
    (ii) Frivolous requests for active status. Beginning with requests 
made for 2005, a request for active status under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of 
this section will be considered frivolous, unless as a result of force 
majeure or other extraordinary circumstances as determined by the 
Regional Administrator if, for a vessel categorized as active in a given 
calendar year, less than 20 percent of the vessel's total landings, by 
weight, in that same year is comprised of tuna harvested by purse seine 
in the Convention Area.
    (iii) Inactive status. From August 1 through November 30 of each 
year, vessel owners or managing owners may request that vessels 
qualified to be listed on the Vessel Register under paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section be categorized as inactive for the following calendar year 
by submitting to the Regional Administrator payment of the associated 
observer placement fees. At any time during the year, a vessel owner or 
managing owner may request that a vessel qualified to be listed on the 
Vessel Register under paragraph (b)(2) of this section be categorized as 
inactive for the remainder of the calendar year by submitting to the 
Regional Administrator payment of the associated observer placement fee 
plus a 10 percent surcharge of the fee. Payment of the observer 
placement fee consistent with inactive status will be interpreted by the 
Regional Administrator as a request for the vessel to be categorized as 
inactive.
    (5) Removal from the vessel register. A vessel may be removed from 
the Vessel Register by the Regional Administrator:

[[Page 780]]

    (i) If the vessel has sunk;
    (ii) Upon written request by the vessel's owner or managing owner;
    (iii) Following a final agency action on a permit sanction for a 
violation;
    (iv) For failure to pay a penalty or for default on a penalty 
payment agreement resulting from a final agency action for a violation; 
or
    (v) If the U.S. Maritime Administration or the U.S. Coast Guard 
notifies NMFS that:
    (A) The owner has submitted an application for transfer of the 
vessel to foreign registry and flag; or
    (B) The documentation for the vessel will be or has been deleted for 
any reason.
    (6) Process for Removal from the Vessel Register. When a vessel is 
removed from the Vessel Register under paragraph (b)(5) of this section, 
the Regional Administrator shall promptly notify the vessel owner in 
writing of the removal and the reasons therefor. For a removal from the 
Vessel Register under Sec. 300.22(b)(5)(iii), the Regional 
Administrator will not accept a request to reinstate the vessel to the 
Vessel Register for the term of the permit sanction. For a removal from 
the Vessel Register under Sec. 300.22(b)(5)(iv), the Regional 
Administrator will not accept a request to reinstate the vessel to the 
Vessel Register until such time as payment is made on the penalty or 
penalty agreement, or such other duration as NOAA and the vessel owner 
may agree upon.
    (7) Procedures for replacing vessels removed from the Vessel 
Register. (i) A vessel previously listed on the Vessel Register, but not 
included for a given year or years, may be added back to the Vessel 
Register and categorized as inactive at any time during the year, 
provided the owner of the vessel pays the observer placement fee 
associated with inactive status plus a 10 percent surcharge of the fee.
    (ii) A vessel may be added to the Vessel Register and categorized as 
active in order to replace a vessel removed from active status under 
paragraph (b)(5) of this section, provided the total carrying capacity 
of active vessels does not exceed 8,969 mt and the owner submits a 
complete request under paragraph (b)(7)(iv) or (v) of this section.
    (iii) After a vessel categorized as active is removed from the 
Vessel Register, the Regional Administrator will notify owners or 
managing owners of vessels categorized as inactive that replacement 
capacity is available on the active list of the Vessel Register. In the 
event that owners of inactive vessels do not request to replace a 
removed vessel, the Regional Administrator will notify owners of vessels 
eligible for, but not included on, the Vessel Register that replacement 
capacity is available on the active list of the Vessel Register.
    (iv) The owner or managing owner of a purse seine vessel of 400 st 
(362.8 mt) carrying capacity or less may request a vessel be categorized 
as active to replace a vessel removed from the Vessel Register by 
submitting payment of the observer placement fee to the Regional 
Administrator.
    (v) The owner or managing owner of a purse seine vessel in excess of 
400 st (362.8 mt) carrying capacity may request a vessel be categorized 
as active to replace a vessel removed from the Vessel Register by 
submitting to the Regional Administrator under Sec. 216.24(b) of this 
title, the observer placement fee, vessel permit application, and permit 
application processing fee for the replacement vessel. The replacement 
vessel will be eligible to be categorized as active on the Vessel 
Register if it has a carrying capacity equal to or less than the vessel 
being replaced, and the captain of the replacement vessel possesses an 
operator permit under Sec. 216.24(b) of this title.
    (vi) The Regional Administrator will forward requests to replace 
vessels removed from the Vessel Register within 15 days of receiving 
each request.

Sec. 300.25  Eastern Pacific fisheries management.

    (a) Notification of IATTC recommendations. The Regional 
Administrator will directly notify owners or agents of U.S. tuna vessels 
of any fishery management recommendations made by the IATTC and approved 
by the Department of State that will affect fishing or other activities 
by U.S. parties with fishery interests in the Convention Area. As soon 
as practicable after such notification, the Regional Administrator will 
announce approved IATTC recommendations in the Federal Register.
    (b) Tuna quotas. (1) Fishing seasons for all tuna species begin on 
January 1 and end either on December 31 or when NMFS closes the fishery 
for a specific species.
    (2) The Regional Administrator may close the U.S. fishery for 
yellowfin, bigeye, or skipjack tuna or any other tuna species in the 
Convention Area or portion of the Convention Area when advised by the 
Director of Investigations of the IATTC that the associated quota has 
been or is projected to be reached. Any such closure may include:
    (i) An allowance for an incidental catch that may be landed while 
fishing for other tuna species;
    (ii) A prohibition on the further setting of specified gear types on 
floating objects by U.S. vessels in the Convention Area;
    (iii) Provisions for vessels that are at sea during an announced 
closure to fish unrestricted until the fishing trip is completed;
    (iv) Provisions for vessels at sea with an observer on board during 
any closure to land fish unrestricted if the landing occurs after 
December 31; or
    (v) Other measures to ensure that the conservation and management 
measures of the IATTC are achieved.
    (3) The Regional Administrator will announce any such closures 
directly to the owners or agents of U.S. vessels who are fishing in or 
are eligible to fish in the Convention Area.
    (4) As soon as practicable after being advised of the quota 
attainment or projection under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the 
Regional Administrator will publish an announcement of the closure in 
the Federal Register.
    (c) Use of tender vessels. No person subject to these regulations 
may use a tender vessel in the Convention Area.
    (d) Transshipments at sea. No person subject to these regulations 
may transship purse seine-caught tuna from one vessel to another vessel 
at sea within the Convention Area.
    (e) Bycatch reduction measures. (1) Through December 31, 2001, all 
purse seine vessels must retain on board and land all bigeye, skipjack, 
and yellowfin tuna brought on board the vessel after a set, except fish 
deemed unfit for

[[Page 782]]

human consumption for other than reason of size. This requirement shall 
not apply to the last set of a trip if the available well capacity is 
insufficient to accommodate the entire fish catch brought on board.
    (2) All purse seine vessels must release all sharks, billfishes, 
rays, mahimahi (dorado), and other non-tuna fish species, except those 
being retained for consumption aboard the vessel, as soon as practicable 
after being identified on board the vessel during the brailing 
operation.
    (3) All purse seine vessels must apply special sea turtle handling 
and release procedures, as follows:
    (i) Whenever a sea turtle is sighted in the net, a speedboat shall 
be stationed close to the point where the net is lifted out of the water 
to assist in release of the turtle;
    (ii) If a turtle is entangled in the net, net roll shall stop as 
soon as the turtle comes out of the water and shall not resume until the 
turtle has been disentangled and released;
    (iii) If, in spite of the measures taken under paragraphs (e)(3)(i) 
and (ii) of this section, a turtle is accidentally brought onboard the 
vessel alive and active, the vessel's engine shall be disengaged and the 
turtle shall be released as quickly as practicable;
    (iv) If a turtle brought on board under paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of 
this section is alive but comatose or inactive, the resuscitation 
procedures described in Sec. 223.206(d)(1)(i)(B) of this title shall be 
used before release of the turtle.

VMS unit is properly transmitting position reports. If the manual 
position reports cannot be made, the vessel operator or owner must 
notify the Administrator of such as soon as possible, by any means 
possible.
    (2) If directed by the Administrator or an authorized officer, the 
vessel operator must immediately stow the fishing gear in the manner 
described in Sec. 300.36, take the vessel directly to a port designated 
by the Administrator or authorized officer, and notify the Administrator 
by telephone, facsimile, or e-mail as soon as possible that the vessel 
is being taken to port with fishing gear stowed.
    (g) Shutdown of VMS unit while in port or in shipyard. When a vessel 
is in port and not moving, the VMS unit may be shut down, provided that 
the Administrator has been notified by telephone, facsimile, or e-mail 
that the vessel is in port and of the intended shutdown, and only as 
long as manual position reports as described in paragraph (f)(1) of this 
section are submitted to the Administrator at intervals of no greater 
than 24 hours or a shorter interval if and as specified by the 
Administrator or an authorized officer. If the VMS unit is shut down 
while the vessel is in port, the vessel owner or operator must notify 
the Administrator by telephone, facsimile, or e-mail as soon as possible

[[Page 795]]

after the vessel's departure from port. When the vessel is in a 
shipyard, the VMS unit may be shut down and the submission of manual 
position reports is not required, provided that the Administrator has 
been notified by telephone, facsimile, or e-mail that the vessel is in 
the shipyard and of the intended VMS unit shutdown. If the VMS unit is 
shut down while the vessel is in a shipyard, the vessel owner or 
operator must notify the Administrator by telephone, facsimile, or e-
mail as soon as possible after the vessel's departure from the shipyard.
    (h) VMS unit repair and replacement. After a fishing trip during 
which interruption of automatic position reports has occurred, the 
vessel's owner or operator must have the VMS unit repaired or replaced 
prior to the vessel's next trip. If the VMS unit is replaced, the new 
VMS unit must be installed by an Administrator-authorized VMS unit 
installer, as specified in paragraph (c) of this section. In making such 
repairs or replacements, conformity with the current requirements must 
be met before the vessel may lawfully operate under the Treaty.
    (i) Access to data. As a condition to obtaining a license, holders 
of vessel licenses issued under Sec. 300.32 must allow the Regional 
Administrator, an authorized officer, the Administrator or an authorized 
party officer or designees access to the vessel's position data obtained 
from the VMS unit at the time of, or after, its transmission to the 
vendor or receiver.

Sec. 300.62  Annual management measures.

    Annual management measures may be added and modified through 
adoption by the Commission and publication in the Federal Register by 
the Assistant Administrator, with immediate regulatory effect. Such 
measures may include, inter alia, provisions governing: Licensing of 
vessels, inseason actions, regulatory areas, fishing periods, closed 
periods, closed areas, catch limits (quotas), fishing period limits, 
size limits, careful release of halibut, vessel clearances, logs, 
receipt and possession of halibut, fishing gear, retention of tagged 
halibut, supervision of unloading and weighing, and sport fishing for 
halibut. The Assistant Administrator will publish the Commission's 
regulations setting forth annual management measures in the Federal 
Register by March 15 each year. Annual management measures may be 
adjusted inseason by the Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 300.63  Catch sharing plan and domestic management measures
in Area 2A.

    (a) A catch sharing plan (CSP) may be developed by the Pacific 
Fishery Management Council and approved by NMFS for portions of the 
fishery. Any approved CSP may be obtained from the Administrator, 
Northwest Region, NMFS.
    (b)(1) Each year, before January 1, NMFS will publish a proposal to 
govern the recreational fishery under the CSP for the following year and 
will seek public comment. The comment period will extend until after the 
Commission's annual meeting, so the public will have the opportunity to 
consider the final area 2A total allowable catch

[[Page 798]]

(TAC) before submitting comments. After the Commission's annual meeting 
and review of public comments, NMFS will publish in the Federal Register 
the final rule governing sport fishing in area 2A. Annual management 
measures may be adjusted inseason by NMFS.
    (2) A portion of the commercial TAC is allocated as incidental catch 
in the salmon troll fishery in Area 2A. Each year the landing 
restrictions necessary to keep the fishery within its allocation will be 
recommended by the Pacific Fishery Management Council at its spring 
meetings, and will be published in the Federal Register along with the 
annual salmon management measures.
    (3) A portion of the Area 2A Washington recreational TAC is 
allocated as incidental catch in the primary directed longline sablefish 
fishery north of 46[deg]53.30[min] N. lat, (Pt. Chehalis, Washington), 
which is regulated under 50 CFR 660.372. This fishing opportunity is 
only available in years in which the Area 2A TAC is greater than 900,000 
lb (408.2 mt,) provided that a minimum of 10,000 lb (4.5 mt) is 
available above a Washington recreational TAC of 214,100 lb (97.1 mt). 
Each year that this harvest is available, the landing restrictions 
necessary to keep this fishery within its allocation will be recommended 
by the Pacific Fishery Management Council at its spring meetings, and 
will be published in the Federal Register. These restrictions will be 
designed to ensure the halibut harvest is incidental to the sablefish 
harvest and will be based on the amounts of halibut and sablefish 
available to this fishery, and other pertinent factors. The restrictions 
may include catch or landing ratios, landing limits, or other means to 
control the rate of halibut landings.
    (i) In years when this incidental harvest of halibut in the directed 
sablefish fishery north of 46[deg]53.30[min] N. lat. is allowed, it is 
allowed only for vessels using longline gear that are registered to 
groundfish limited entry permits with sablefish endorsements and that 
possess the appropriate incidental halibut harvest license issued by the 
Commission.
    (ii) It is unlawful for any person to possess, land or purchase 
halibut south of 46[deg]53.30[min] N. lat. that were taken and retained 
as incidental catch authorized by this section in the directed longline 
sablefish fishery.
    (4) The commercial longline fishery in area 2A is governed by the 
annual management measures published pursuant to Sec. Sec. 300.62 and 
300.63.
    (5) The treaty Indian fishery is governed by Sec. 300.64 and tribal 
regulations. The annual quota for the fishery will be announced with the 
Commission regulations under Sec. 300.62
    (c) Flexible Inseason Management Provisions for Sport Halibut 
Fisheries in Area 2A.
    (1) The Regional Administrator, NMFS Northwest Region, after 
consultation with the Chairman of the Pacific Fishery Management 
Council, the Commission Executive Director, and the Fisheries 
Director(s) of the affected state(s), or their designees, is authorized 
to modify regulations during the season after making the following 
determinations:
    (i) The action is necessary to allow allocation objectives to be 
met.
    (ii) The action will not result in exceeding the catch limit for the 
area.
    (iii) If any of the sport fishery subareas north of Cape Falcon, 
Oregon are not projected to utilize their respective quotas by September 
30, NMFS may take inseason action to transfer any projected unused quota 
to another Washington sport subarea.
    (iv) If any of the sport fishery subareas south of Leadbetter Point, 
Washington, are not projected to utilize their respective quotas by 
their season ending dates, NMFS may take inseason action to transfer any 
projected unused quota to another Oregon sport subarea.
    (2) Flexible inseason management provisions include, but are not 
limited to, the following:
    (i) Modification of sport fishing periods;
    (ii) Modification of sport fishing bag limits;
    (iii) Modification of sport fishing size limits;
    (iv) Modification of sport fishing days per calendar week; and
    (v) Modification of subarea quotas.

[[Page 799]]

    (3) Notice procedures. (i) Actions taken under this section will be 
published in the Federal Register.
    (ii) Actual notice of inseason management actions will be provided 
by a telephone hotline administered by the Northwest Region, NMFS, at 
206-526-6667 or 800-662-9825 (May through October) and by U.S. Coast 
Guard broadcasts. These broadcasts are announced on Channel 16 VHF-FM 
and 2182 kHz at frequent intervals. The announcements designate the 
channel or frequency over which the notice to mariners will be 
immediately broadcast. Since provisions of these regulations may be 
altered by inseason actions, sport fishers should monitor either the 
telephone hotline or U.S. Coast Guard broadcasts for current information 
for the area in which they are fishing.
    (4) Effective dates. (i) Any action issued under this section is 
effective on the date specified in the publication or at the time that 
the action is filed for public inspection with the Office of the Federal 
Register, whichever is later.
    (ii) If time allows, NMFS will invite public comment prior to the 
effective date of any inseason action filed with the Federal Register. 
If the Regional Administrator determines, for good cause, that an 
inseason action must be filed without affording a prior opportunity for 
public comment, public comments will be received for a period of 15 days 
after publication of the action in the Federal Register.
    (iii) Any inseason action issued under this section will remain in 
effect until the stated expiration date or until rescinded, modified, or 
superseded. However, no inseason action has any effect beyond the end of 
the calendar year in which it is issued.
    (5) Availability of data. The Regional Administrator will compile, 
in aggregate form, all data and other information relevant to the action 
being taken and will make them available for public review during normal 
office hours at the Northwest Regional Office, NMFS, Sustainable 
Fisheries Division, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, Washington.
    (d) Fishery Election in Area 2A. (1) A vessel that fishes in Area 2A 
may participate in only one of the following three fisheries in Area 2A:
    (i) The sport fishery under Section 24 of the annual domestic 
management measures and IPHC regulations;

period(s) established in section 8 of the annual domestic management 
measures and IPHC regulations and/or the incidental retention of halibut 
during the primary sablefish fishery described at 50 CFR 660.372; or
    (iii) The incidental catch fishery during the salmon troll fishery 
as authorized in section 8 of the annual domestic management measures 
and IPHC regulations.
    (2) No person shall fish for halibut in the sport fishery in Area 2A 
under section 24 of the annual domestic management measures and IPHC 
regulations from a vessel that has been used during the same calendar 
year for commercial halibut fishing in Area 2A or that has been issued a 
permit for the same calendar year for the commercial halibut fishery in 
Area 2A.
    (3) No person shall fish for halibut in the directed commercial 
halibut fishery during the fishing periods established in section 8 of 
the annual domestic management measures and IPHC regulations and/or 
retain halibut incidentally taken in the primary sablefish fishery in 
Area 2A from a vessel that has been used during the same calendar year 
for the incidental catch fishery during the salmon troll fishery as 
authorized in Section 8 of the annual domestic management measures and 
IPHC regulations.
    (4) No person shall fish for halibut in the directed commercial 
halibut fishery and/or retain halibut incidentally taken in the primary 
sablefish fishery in Area 2A from a vessel that, during the same 
calendar year, has been used in the sport halibut fishery in Area 2A or 
that is licensed for the sport charter halibut fishery in Area 2A.
    (5) No person shall retain halibut in the salmon troll fishery in 
Area 2A as authorized under section 8 of the annual domestic management 
measures and IPHC regulations taken on a vessel that, during the same

[[Page 800]]

    (6) No person shall retain halibut in the salmon troll fishery in 
Area 2A as authorized under section 8 of the annual domestic management 
measures and IPHC regulations taken on a vessel that, during the same 
calendar year, has been used in the directed commercial halibut fishery 
during the fishing periods established in Section 8 of the annual 
domestic management measures and IPHC regulations and/or retained 
halibut incidentally taken in the primary sablefish fishery for Area 2A 
or that is licensed to participate in these commercial fisheries during 
the fishing periods established in Section 8 of the annual domestic 
management measures and IPHC regulations in Area 2A.
    (e) Area 2A Non-Treaty Commercial Fishery Closed Areas. (1) Non-
treaty commercial vessels operating in the directed commercial fishery 
for halibut in Area 2A are required to fish outside of a closed area, 
known as the Rockfish Conservation Area (RCA), that extends along the 
coast from the U.S./Canada border south to 40[deg]10[min] N. lat. 
Between the U.S./Canada border and 46[deg]16[min] N. lat., the eastern

Sec. 300.108  Vessel and gear identification.

    (a) Vessel identification. (1) The operator of each harvesting 
vessel assigned an IRCS must display that call sign amidships on both 
the port and starboard sides of the deckhouse or hull, so that it is 
visible from an enforcement or inspection vessel, and on an appropriate 
weather deck so that it is visible from the air.
    (2) The operator of each harvesting vessel not assigned an IRCS, 
such as a small trawler associated with a mothership or one of a pair of 
trawlers, must display the IRCS of the associated vessel, followed by a 
numerical suffix specific for the non-assigned vessel.
    (3) The vessel identification must be in a color in contrast to the 
background and must be permanently affixed to the harvesting vessel in 
block roman alphabet letters and arabic numerals at least 1 m in height 
for harvesting vessels over 20 m in length, and at least 0.5 m in height 
for all other harvesting vessels.
    (b) Navigational lights and shapes. Each harvesting vessel must 
display the lights and shapes prescribed by the International 
Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 (TIAS 8587, and 1981 
amendment TIAS 10672), for the activity in which the harvesting vessel 
is engaged (as described at 33 CFR part 81).
    (c) Gear identification. (1) The operator of each harvesting vessel 
must ensure that all deployed fishing gear that is not physically and 
continuously attached to a harvesting vessel is clearly marked at the 
surface with a buoy displaying the vessel identification of the 
harvesting vessel (see paragraph (a) of this section) to which the gear 
belongs, a light visible for 2 miles at night in good visibility, and a 
radio buoy. Trawl codends passed from one vessel to another are 
considered continuously attached gear and do not have to be marked.
    (2) The operator of each harvesting vessel must ensure that deployed 
longlines, strings of traps or pots, and gillnets are marked at the 
surface at each terminal end with a buoy displaying the vessel 
identification of the harvesting vessel to which the gear belongs (see 
paragraph (a) of this section), a light visible for 2 miles at night in 
good visibility, and a radio buoy.
    (3) Unmarked or incorrectly identified fishing gear may be 
considered abandoned and may be disposed of in accordance with 
applicable Federal regulations by any authorized officer or CCAMLR 
inspector.
    (d) Maintenance. The operator of each harvesting vessel must:
    (1) Keep the vessel and gear identification clearly legible and in 
good repair.
    (2) Ensure that nothing on the harvesting vessel obstructs the view 
of the markings from an enforcement or inspection vessel or aircraft.
    (3) Ensure that the proper navigational lights and shapes are 
displayed for the harvesting vessel's activity and are properly 
functioning.


<R05>
Sec. 300.109  Gear disposal.

    (a) The operator of a harvesting vessel may not dump overboard, 
jettison or otherwise discard any article or substance that may 
interfere with other fishing vessels or gear, or that may catch fish or 
cause damage to any marine resource, including marine mammals and birds, 
except in cases of emergency involving the safety of the ship or crew, 
or as specifically authorized by communication from the appropriate USCG 
commander or authorized officer. These articles and substances include, 
but are not limited to, fishing gear, net scraps, bale straps, plastic 
bags, oil drums, petroleum containers, oil, toxic chemicals or any 
manmade items retrieved in a harvesting vessel's gear.

[[Page 837]]

    (b) The operator of a harvesting vessel may not abandon fishing gear 
in Convention waters.
    (c) The operator of a harvesting vessel must provide a copy of the 
CCAMLR information brochure ``Marine Debris--A Potential Threat to 
Antarctic Marine Mammals'' to each member of the crew of the harvesting 
vessel and must display copies of the CCAMLR placard ``Avoidance of 
Incidental Mortality of Antarctic Marine Mammals'' in the wheelhouse and 
crew quarters of the harvesting vessels. Copies of the brochure and 
placard will be provided to each holder of a harvesting permit by NMFS 
when issuing the permit.


<R05>
Sec. 300.110  Mesh size.

    (a) The use of pelagic and bottom trawls having the mesh size in any 
part of a trawl less than indicated is prohibited for any directed 
fishing for the following Antarctic finfishes:
    (1) Notothenia rossii and Dissostichus eleginoides--120 mm.
    (2) Champsocephalus gunnari--90 mm.
    (3) Gobionotothen gibberifrons, Notothenia kempi and Lepidorhirus 
squamifrons--80 mm.
    (b) Any means or device that would reduce the size or obstruct the 
opening of the meshes is prohibited.
    (c) The following procedure will be used for determining compliance 
with mesh size requirements.
    (1) Description of gauges. (i) Gauges for determining mesh sizes 
will be 2 mm thick, flat, of durable material and capable of retaining 
their shape. They may have either a series of parallel-edged sides 
connected by intermediate tapering edges with a taper of one to eight on 
each side, or only tapering edges with the taper defined above. They 
will have a hole at the narrowest extremity.
    (ii) Each gauge will be inscribed on its face with the width in 
millimeters both on the parallel-sided section, if any, and on the 
tapering section. In the case of the latter, the width will be inscribed 
every 1 mm interval, but the indication of the width may appear at 
regular intervals other than 1 mm.
    (2) Use of the gauge. (i) The net will be stretched in the direction 
of the long diagonal of the meshes.
    (ii) A gauge as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section will 
be inserted by its narrowest extremity into the mesh opening in a 
direction perpendicular to the plane of the net.
    (iii) The gauge may be inserted into the mesh opening either with a 
manual force or using a weight or dynamometer, until it is stopped at 
the tapering edges by the resistance of the mesh.
    (3) Selection of meshes to be measured. (i) Meshes to be measured 
will form a series of 20 consecutive meshes chosen in the direction of 
the long axis of the net, except that the meshes to be measured need not 
be consecutive if the application of paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this 
section prevents it.
    (ii) Meshes less than 50 cm from lacings, ropes, or codline will not 
be measured. This distance will be measured perpendicular to the 
lacings, ropes or codline with the net stretched in the direction of 
that measurement. No mesh will be measured which has been mended or 
broken or has attachments to the net fixed at that mesh.
    (iii) Nets will be measured only when wet and unfrozen.
    (4) The measurement of each mesh will be the width of the gauge at 
the point where the gauge is stopped, when using this gauge in 
accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
    (5) Determination of the mesh size of the net will be the 
arithmetical mean in millimeters of the measurements of the total number 
of meshes selected and measured as provided for in paragraphs (c) (3) 
and (4) of this section, the arithmetical mean being rounded up to the 
next millimeter.
    (6) Inspection procedure. (i) One series of 20 meshes, selected in 
accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section, will be measured by 
inserting the gauge manually without using a weight or dynamometer. The 
mesh size of the net will then be determined in accordance with 
paragraph (c)(5) of this section. If the calculation of the mesh size 
shows that the mesh size does not appear to comply with the rules in 
force, then two additional series of 20 meshes selected in accordance 
with paragraph (c)(3) of this section will be measured. The mesh size 
will then be recalculated in accordance with paragraph (c)(5) of this 
section, taking into account the 60

[[Page 838]]

meshes already measured; this recalculation will be the mesh size of the 
net.
    (ii) If the captain of the vessel contests the mesh size determined 
in accordance with paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section, such measurement 
will not be considered for the determination of the mesh size and the 
net will be remeasured.
    (A) A weight or dynamometer attached to the gauge will be used for 
remeasurement. The choice of weight or dynamometer is at the discretion 
of the inspectors. The weight will be fixed to the hole in the narrowest 
extremity of the gauge using a hook. The dynamometer may either be fixed 
to the hole in the narrowest extremity of the gauge or be applied at the 
largest extremity of the gauge.
    (B) The accuracy of the weight or dynamometer must be certified by 
the appropriate national authority.
    (C) For nets of a mesh size of 35 mm or less as determined in 
accordance with paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section, a force of 19.61 
newtons (equivalent to a mass of 2 kg) will be applied, and for other 
nets, a force of 49.03 newtons (equivalent to a mass of 5 kg).
    (D) For the purposes of determining the mesh size in accordance with 
paragraph (c)(5) of this section, when using a weight or dynamometer, 
one series of 20 meshes only will be measured.


<R05>
Sec. 300.111  Framework for annual management measures.

    (a) Introduction. New management measures may be added and others 
modified through publication of a regulatory action in the Federal 
Register. The following framework process authorizes the implementation 
of measures that may affect the operation of the commercial or 
exploratory fisheries, gear, area restrictions, or changes in catch and/
or effort.
    (b) Preliminary notice. The Secretary of State shall publish 
preliminary notice in the Federal Register of the management measures 
adopted by the parties to the Convention.
    (c) Procedure. At its annual meeting, usually in October or 
November, the Commission may recommend new measures and that established 
measures be modified, removed, or re-instituted. After public notice of 
those recommendations by the Secretary of State and opportunity for 
public comment, and after considering the impact of instituting the 
measures and any public comment received by the Secretary of State, the 
Assistant Administrator may implement the management measures by notice 
in the Federal Register, with immediate force and effect. The 
notification in the Federal Register will summarize new management 
measures, and respond to any public comments received by the Secretary 
of State on the preliminary notice.
    (d) Types of management measures to be frameworked. Management 
measures that may be implemented by regulatory notice rather than by 
codified regulation are those that generally will not remain in effect 
for more than 12 months and include catch restrictions, time and area 
closures, and gear restrictions.
    (e) The fishing season for all Convention Area species is December 1 
through November 30 of the following year, unless otherwise set in 
specific CCAMLR conservation measures.

<R05>
Sec. 300.112  Harvesting permits.

    (a) General. (1) Every vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the 
United States that attempts to reduce or reduces any AMLR to possession 
must have a harvesting permit authorizing the attempt or reduction, 
unless the attempt or reduction occurs during recreational fishing or is 
covered by an individual permit. Boats launched from a vessel issued a 
harvesting permit do not require a separate permit, but are covered by 
the permit issued the launching vessel. Any enforcement action that 
results from the activities of a launched boat will be taken against the 
launching vessel.
    (2) Permits issued under this section do not authorize vessels or 
persons subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to harass, 
capture, harm, kill, harvest, or import marine mammals. No marine 
mammals may be taken in the course of commercial fishing operations 
unless the taking is allowed under the Marine Mammal Protection

[[Page 839]]

Act and/or the Endangered Species Act pursuant to an exemption or permit 
granted by the appropriate agency.
    (b) Responsibility of owners and operators. (1) The owners and 
operators of each harvesting vessel are jointly and severally 
responsible for compliance with the Act, this subpart, and any permit 
issued under the Act and this subpart.
    (2) The owners and operators of each such vessel are responsible for 
the acts of their employees and agents constituting violations, 
regardless of whether the specific acts were authorized or forbidden by 
the owners or operators, and regardless of knowledge concerning their 
occurrence.
    (3) The owner of such vessel must report any sale, change in 
ownership, or other disposition of the vessel to the Assistant 
Administrator within 15 days of the occurrence.
    (4) The owners and operators of each krill harvesting vessel using 
trawl gear in Convention Area fisheries must install a seal excluder 
device.
    (c) Application. Application forms for harvesting permits are 
available from the Assistant Administrator (Attn: CCAMLR permits). A 
separate fully completed and accurate application must be submitted for 
each vessel for which a harvesting permit is requested at least 90 days 
before the date anticipated for the beginning of harvesting.
    (d) Issuance. The Assistant Administrator may issue a harvesting 
permit to a vessel if the Assistant Administrator determines that the 
harvesting described in the application will meet the requirements of 
the Act and will not:
    (1) Decrease the size of any harvested population to levels below 
those that ensure its stable recruitment. For this purpose, the 
Convention recommends that its size not be allowed to fall below a level 
close to that which ensures the greatest net annual increment.
    (2) Upset the ecological relationships between harvested, dependent, 
and related populations of AMLRs and the restoration of depleted 
populations to levels that will ensure stable recruitment.
    (3) Cause changes or increase the risk of changes in the marine 
ecosystem that are not potentially reversible over 2 or 3 decades, 
taking into account the state of available knowledge of the direct and 
indirect impact of harvesting, the effect of the introduction of alien 
species, the effects of associated activities on the marine ecosystem 
and of the effects of environmental changes, with the aim of making 
possible the sustained conservation of AMLRs.
    (4) Violate the management measures issued pursuant to Sec. 300.111 
of this subpart.
    (5) Violate any other conservation measures in force with respect to 
the United States under the Convention or the Act.
    (e) Duration. A harvesting permit is valid from its date of issuance 
to its date of expiration unless it is revoked or suspended.
    (f) Transfer. Permits are not transferable or assignable. A permit 
is valid only for the vessel to which it is issued.
    (g) Display. Each harvesting vessel when engaged in harvesting must 
either have on board an up-to-date copy of its harvesting permit or a 
fully completed and up-to-date harvesting vessel certificate and the 
vessel operator must produce it for inspection upon the request of an 
authorized officer or CCAMLR inspector. In order for the certificate to 
be considered complete, the vessel owner or operator must enter on it 
the name and IRCS of the vessel issued the harvesting permit, the number 
of the harvesting permit and its date of issuance and expiration, the 
harvesting authorized by the permit, and all conditions and restrictions 
contained in the permit. Blank certificates are available from the 
Assistant Administrator.
    (h) Changes in information submitted by permit applicants or 
holders--(1) Changes in pending applications. Applicants for a 
harvesting permit must report to the Assistant Administrator in writing 
any change in the information contained in the application. The 
processing period for the application will be extended as necessary to 
review the change.
    (2) Changes occurring after permit issuance--(i) Changes other than 
in the manner and amount of harvesting. The owner or operator of a 
vessel that has been issued a harvesting permit must

[[Page 840]]

report to the Assistant Administrator in writing any change in 
previously submitted information other than a proposed change in the 
location, manner, or amount of harvesting within 15 days of the change. 
Based on such reported information, the Assistant Administrator may 
revise the permit effective upon notification to the permit holder. As 
soon as possible, the vessel owner or operator must revise any 
harvesting vessel certificate evidencing the permit, accordingly.
    (ii) Requested changes in the location, manner, or amount of 
harvesting. Any changes in the manner or amount of harvesting must be 
proposed in writing to the Assistant Administrator and may not be 
undertaken unless authorized by the Assistant Administrator through a 
permit revision or issuance of a new permit. If a requested change in 
the location, manner, or amount of harvesting could significantly affect 
the status of any Antarctic marine living resource, the Assistant 
Administrator will treat the requested change as an application for a 
new permit and so notify the holder.
    (i) Additional conditions and restrictions. The Assistant 
Administrator may revise the harvesting permit, effective upon 
notification to the permit holder, to impose additional conditions and 
restrictions on the harvesting vessel as necessary to achieve the 
purposes of the Convention or the Act. The permit holder must, as soon 
as possible, direct the vessel operator to revise the harvesting vessel 
certificate, if any, accordingly.
    (j) Revision, suspension, or revocation for violations. A harvesting 
permit may be revised, suspended, or revoked if the harvesting vessel is 
involved in the commission of any violation of its permit, the Act, or 
this subpart. Failure to report a change in the information contained in 
an application within 15 days of the change is a violation of this 
subpart and voids the application or permit, as applicable. If a change 
in vessel ownership is not reported, the violation is chargeable to the 
previous owner. Title 15 CFR part 904 governs permit sanctions under 
this subpart.
    (k) Transshipment vessels. Any U.S. flagged vessel that receives or 
attempts to receive Dissostichus species from a harvesting vessel at 
sea, regardless of whether such transshipment occurs in waters under the 
jurisdiction of CCAMLR, must obtain from NMFS a harvesting permit 
authorizing transshipment. Transshipment vessels must comply with the 
permitting provisions of this section with respect to harvesting 
vessels.

Sec. 300.113  Scientific observers.

    This section applies to national and international observers as 
defined in Sec. 300.101.
    (a) This section applies to a national observer aboard U.S. vessels 
harvesting in the Convention Area, national observers placed on foreign 
flagged vessels and international observers placed on U.S. vessels 
harvesting in the Convention Area.
    (b) All U.S. vessels fishing in the Convention Area must carry one 
or more scientific observers as required by CCAMLR conservation and 
management measures or as specified in a NMFS-issued AMLR Harvesting 
Permit.
    (c) All U.S. vessels conducting longline sink rate testing outside 
the Convention area and pursuant to CCAMLR protocols must carry one or 
more scientific observers as specified in a NMFS-issued AMLR Harvesting 
Permit.
    (d) Procurement of observers by vessel. Owners of vessels required 
to carry scientific observers under this section must arrange for 
observer services in coordination with the NMFS Southwest Fisheries 
Science Center Antarctic Ecosystem Research Division. The vessel owner 
is required to pay for observer services through an observer service 
provider who has provided observer services to the Federal government 
within the past year. In situations where no qualified observer is 
available through a qualified observer provider, the Secretary may 
authorize a vessel owner to arrange for an observer by alternative 
methods. An observer may not be paid directly by the vessel owner.
    (e) Insurance. The observer service provider or vessel owner must 
provide

[[Page 841]]

insurance for observers that provides compensation in the event of an 
injury or death during the entire deployment, from the point of hire 
location to return, equivalent to the standards of the North Pacific 
Groundfish Observer Program set forth in Sec. 679.80 of this title.
    (f) Educational requirements. National observer candidates must:
    (1) Have a Bachelor's degree or higher from an accredited college or 
university with a major in one of the natural sciences; or
    (2) Have successfully completed a minimum of 30 semester hours or 
equivalent in applicable biological sciences with extensive use of 
dichotomous keys in at least one course.
    (g) Health requirements. National observers must have a signed and 
dated statement from a licensed physician that he or she has physically 
examined the observer. The statement must confirm that, based upon the 
physical examination, the observer does not have any health problems or 
conditions that would jeopardize that individual's safety or the safety 
of others while deployed, or prevent the observer from performing his or 
her duties satisfactorily. The statement must declare that prior to the 
examination; the physician was made aware of the duties of an observer 
and the dangerous, remote and rigorous nature of the work. The 
physician's statement must be submitted to the NMFS Southwest Fisheries 
Science Center Antarctic Ecosystem Research Division program office 
prior to approval of an observer. The physical exam must have occurred 
during the 12 months prior to the observer's deployment. The physician's 
statement will expire 12 months after the physical exam occurred. A new 
physical exam must be performed, and accompanying statement submitted, 
prior to any deployment occurring after the expiration of the statement.
    (h) Vessel responsibilities. An operator of a vessel required to 
carry one or more scientific observers must:
    (1) Accommodations and food. Provide, at no cost to the observers or 
the United States, accommodations and food on the vessel for the 
observer or observers that are equivalent to those provided for officers 
of the vessel; and
    (2) Safe conditions. (i) Maintain safe conditions on the vessel for 
the protection of observers including adherence to all U.S. Coast Guard 
and other applicable rules, regulations, or statutes pertaining to safe 
operation of the vessel.
    (ii) Have on board:
    (A) A valid Commercial Fishing Vessel Safety Decal issued within the 
past 2 years that certifies compliance with regulations found in 33 CFR 
chapter I and 46 CFR chapter I. NMFS will grant a waiver from the 
Voluntary Safety decal provision if the vessel is in compliance with the 
standards of the observer vessel safety check list developed by the 
Northeast Fisheries Science Center http://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/femad/fsb/ 
or equivalent certification issued by the Flagging State;
    (B) A certificate of compliance issued pursuant to 46 CFR 28.710; or
    (C) A valid certificate of inspection pursuant to 46 U.S.C. 3311.
    (3) Health and safety regulations. Comply with the Observer health 
and safety regulations at part 600 of this title. NMFS will grant a 
waiver from the Voluntary Safety decal provision if the vessel is in 
compliance with the standards of the observer vessel safety check list.
    (4) Transmission of data. Facilitate transmission of observer data 
by allowing observers, on request, to use the vessel's communications 
equipment and personnel for the confidential entry, transmission, and 
receipt of work-related messages.
    (5) Vessel position. Allow observers access to, and the use of, the 
vessel's navigation equipment and personnel, on request, to determine 
the vessel's position, course and speed.
    (6) Access. Allow observers free and unobstructed access to the 
vessel's bridge, trawl or working decks, holding bins, processing areas, 
freezer spaces, weight scales, cargo holds, and any other space that may 
be used to hold, process, weigh, or store fish or fish products at any 
time.
    (7) Prior notification. Notify observers at least 15 minutes before 
fish are brought on board, or fish and fish products are transferred 
from the vessel, to allow sampling the catch or observing

[[Page 842]]

the transfer, unless the observers specifically request not to be 
notified.
    (8) Records. Allow observers to inspect and copy the vessel's CCAMLR 
DCD, product transfer forms, any other logbook or document required by 
regulations, printouts or tallies of scale weights, scale calibration 
records, bin sensor readouts, and production records.
    (9) Assistance. Provide all other reasonable assistance to enable 
observers to carry out their duties, including, but not limited to:
    (i) Measuring decks, codends, and holding bins;
    (ii) Providing the observers with a safe work area adjacent to the 
sample collection site;
    (iii) Collecting bycatch when requested by the observers;
    (iv) Collecting and carrying baskets of fish when requested by 
observers; and
    (v) Allowing observers to determine the sex of fish when this 
procedure will not decrease the value of a significant portion of the 
catch.
    (10) Transfer at sea. (i) Ensure that transfers of observers at sea 
via small boat or raft are carried out during daylight hours, under safe 
conditions, and with the agreement of observers involved.
    (ii) Notify observers at least 3 hours before observers are 
transferred, such that the observers can collect personal belongings, 
equipment, and scientific samples.
    (iii) Provide a safe pilot ladder and conduct the transfer to ensure 
the safety of observers during transfers.
    (iv) Provide an experienced crew member to assist observers in the 
small boat or raft in which any transfer is made.
    (i) Standards of observer conduct--(1) Observers: (i) Must not have 
a direct financial interest in the fishery being observed, including but 
not limited to:
    (A) Any ownership, mortgage holder, or other secured interest in a 
vessel, shoreside or floating stationary processor facility involved in 
the catching, taking, harvesting or processing of fish;
    (B) Any business involved with selling supplies or services to any 
vessel, shoreside or floating stationary processing facility; or
    (C) Any business involved with purchasing raw or processed products 
from any vessel, shoreside or floating stationary processing facilities.
    (ii) Must not solicit or accept, directly or indirectly, any 
gratuity, gift, favor, entertainment, loan, or anything of monetary 
value from anyone who either conducts activities that are regulated by 
NMFS or has interests that may be substantially affected by the 
performance or nonperformance of the observers' official duties.
    (iii) May not serve as observers on any vessel or at any shoreside 
or floating stationary processing facility owned or operated by a person 
who previously employed the observers.
    (iv) May not solicit or accept employment as a crew member or an 
employee of a vessel, shoreside processor, or stationary floating 
processor while employed by an observer provider.
    (2) Provisions for remuneration of observers under this section do 
not constitute a conflict of interest.
    (j) Standards of observer behavior. Observers must avoid any 
behavior that could adversely affect the confidence of the public in the 
integrity of the Observer Program or of the government, including but 
not limited to the following:
    (1) Observers must perform their assigned duties as described in the 
CCAMLR Scientific Observers Manual and must complete the CCAMLR 
Scientific Observer Logbooks and submit them to the CCAMLR Data Manager 
at the intervals specified by the Data Manager.
    (2) Observers must accurately record their sampling data, write 
complete reports, and report accurately any observations of suspected 
violations of regulations relevant to conservation of marine resources 
or their environment.
    (3) Observers must not disclose collected data and observations made 
on board the vessel or in the processing facility to any person except 
the owner or operator of the observed vessel or processing facility, or 
NMFS.
    (4) Observers must refrain from engaging in any illegal actions or 
any other activities that would reflect negatively on their image as 
professional

[[Page 843]]

scientists, on other observers, or on the Observer Program as a whole. 
This includes, but is not limited to:
    (i) Engaging in the use, possession, or distribution of illegal 
drugs; or
    (ii) Engaging in physical sexual contact with personnel of the 
vessel or processing facility to which the observer is assigned, or with 
any vessel or processing plant personnel who may be substantially 
affected by the performance or non-performance of the observer's 
official duties.
    (k) Sampling station. (1) Minimum work space aboard at sea 
processing vessels. The observer must have a working area of 4.5 square 
meters, including the observer's sampling table, for sampling and 
storage of fish to be sampled. The observer must be able to stand 
upright and have a work area at least 0.9 m deep in the area in front of 
the table and scale.
    (2) Table aboard at-sea processing vessels. The observer sampling 
station must include a table at least 0.6 m deep, 1.2 m wide and 0.9 m 
high and no more than 1.1 m high. The entire surface area of the table 
must be available for use by the observer. Any area for the observer 
sampling scale is in addition to the minimum space requirements for the 
table. The observer's sampling table must be secured to the floor or 
wall.
    (3) Other requirement for at-sea processing vessels. The sampling

Sec. 300.114  Dealer permits and preapproval.

    (a) General. (1) A dealer intending to import or re-export AMLR must 
obtain an AMLR dealer permit valid for one year. Preapproval from NMFS 
is required for each shipment of frozen Dissostichus species. The permit 
holder may only conduct those specific activities stipulated by the 
permit.
    (2) An AMLR may be imported into the United States if its harvest 
has been authorized by a U.S.-issued individual permit issued under 
Sec. 300.112(a)(1) or its importation has been authorized by a NMFS-
issued dealer permit and preapproval issued under Sec. 300.114(a)(1). 
AMLRs may not be released for entry into the United States unless 
accompanied by the harvesting permit or the individual permit or dealer 
permit and, in the case of frozen Dissostichus species, the preapproval 
certification granted by NMFS to allow import. NMFS will only accept 
electronic catch documents for toothfish imports.
    (3) In no event may a marine mammal be imported into the United 
States unless authorized and accompanied by an import permit issued 
under the Marine Mammal Protection Act and/or the Endangered Species 
Act.
    (4) A dealer permit or preapproval issued under this section does 
not authorize the harvest or transshipment of any AMLR by or to a vessel 
of the United States.
    (b) Application. Application forms for AMLR dealer permits and 
preapproval are available from NMFS. With the exception of the U.S. 
Customs 7501 entry number, a complete and accurate application must be 
received by NMFS for each preapproval at least 15 working days before 
the anticipated date of the first receipt, importation, or re-export. 
Dealers must supply the U.S. Customs 7501 entry number at least three 
working days prior to a Dissostichus species shipment's arrival.
    (c) Fees. A fee to recover the administrative expenses associated 
with processing preapproval applications will be charged. The amount of 
the fee will be determined in accordance with procedures specified in 
the NOAA Finance Handbook for calculating administrative costs of 
special products and services. The fee is specified with the preapproval 
application form. The appropriate fee must accompany each application 
and be paid by check, draft, or money order.
    (d) Issuance. NMFS may issue a dealer permit or preapproval if it 
determines that the activity proposed by the dealer meets the 
requirements of the Act and that the resources were not or will not be 
harvested in violation of any conservation measure in force with respect 
to the United States

[[Page 844]]

or in violation of any regulation in this subpart.
    (e) Duration. A permit issued under this section is valid from its 
date of issuance to its date of expiration unless it is revoked or 
suspended. A preapproval is valid until the product is imported (and re-
exported, if applicable).
    (f) Transfer. A permit issued under this section is not transferable 
or assignable.
    (g) Changes in information--(1) Pending applications. Applicants for 
permits and preapproval under this section must report in writing to 
NMFS any change in the information submitted in their permit and 
preapproval applications. The processing period for the application may 
be extended as necessary to review and consider the change.
    (2) Issued permits and preapprovals. Any entity issued a permit or 
preapproval under this section must report in writing to NMFS any 
changes in previously submitted information. Any changes that would 
result in a change in the receipt or importation authorized by the 
preapproval, such as harvesting vessel or country of origin, type and 
quantity of the resource to be received or imported, and Convention 
statistical subarea from which the resource was harvested, must be 
proposed in writing to NMFS and may not be undertaken unless authorized 
by NMFS through issuance of a revised or new preapproval.
    (h) Revision, suspension, or revocation. A permit or preapproval 
issued under this section may be revised, suspended, or revoked, based 
upon a violation of the permit, the Act, or this subpart. Failure to 
report a change in the information contained in a permit or preapproval 
application voids the application, permit, or preapproval as applicable. 
Title 15 CFR part 904 governs permit sanctions under this subpart.
    (i) Exception. Preapproval is not required for shipments of fresh 
Dissostichus species. A report of a shipment of fresh Dissostichus 
species must be completed and submitted to NMFS within 24 hours 
following import.
    (j) SVDCD. Dealer permits will not be issued for Dissostichus spp. 
offered for sale or other disposition under a Specially Validated DCD.
    (k) Registered agent. Foreign entities shall, as a condition of 
possessing a dealer permit, designate and maintain a registered agent 
within the United States that is authorized to accept service of process 
on behalf of that entity. Foreign based importers of record may identify 
to NMFS the registered agent identified for Customs Service purposes.

Sec. 300.116  Requirements for a vessel monitoring system.

    (a) Requirement for use. Within 30 days after NMFS publishes in the 
Federal Register a list of approved transmitting units and associated 
communications service providers for the AMLR fishery, an owner or 
operator of a vessel that has been issued a harvesting permit for AMLR 
must ensure that such vessel has a NMFS-approved, operating VMS on board 
when on any fishing trip involving the harvesting of AMLR. An operating 
VMS includes an operating mobile transmitting unit on the vessel and a 
functioning communication link between the unit and NMFS as provided by 
a NMFS-approved communication service provider.
    (b) Installing and activating the VMS. Only a VMS that has been 
approved by NMFS for use in the AMLR fishery may be used. When 
installing and activating the NMFS-approved VMS, or when reinstalling 
and reactivating

[[Page 845]]

such VMS, the vessel owner or operator must--
    (1) Follow procedures indicated on an installation and activation 
checklist, which is available from OLE; and
    (2) Submit to OLE a statement certifying compliance with the 
checklist, as prescribed on the checklist.
    (c) Interference with the VMS. No person may interfere with, tamper 
with, alter, damage, disable, or impede the operation of the VMS, or 
attempt any of the same.
    (d) Interruption of operation of the VMS. When a vessel's VMS is not 
operating properly, the owner or operator must immediately contact OLE, 
and follow instructions from that office. If notified by NMFS that a 
vessel's VMS is not operating properly, the owner and operator must 
follow instructions from that office. In either event, such instructions 
may include, but are not limited to, manually communicating to a 
location designated by NMFS the vessel's positions or returning to port 
until the VMS is operable.
    (e) Access to position data. As a condition of authorized fishing 
for or possession of AMLR, a vessel owner or operator subject to the 
requirements for a VMS in this section must allow NMFS, the USCG, and 
their authorized officers and designees access to the vessel's position 
data obtained from the VMS.
    (f) Installation and operation of the VMS. NMFS has authority over 
the installation and operation of the VMS unit. NMFS may authorize the 
connection or order the disconnection of additional equipment, including 
a computer, to any VMS unit when deemed appropriate by NMFS.

Sec. 300.118  Facilitation of enforcement and inspection.

    In addition to the facilitation of enforcement provisions of Sec. 
300.5, the following requirements apply to this subpart.
    (a) Access and records. (1) The owners and operator of each 
harvesting vessel must provide authorized officers and CCAMLR inspectors 
access to all spaces where work is conducted or business papers and 
records are prepared or stored, including but not limited to personal 
quarters and areas within personal quarters. If inspection of a 
particular area would interfere with specific on-going scientific 
research, and if the operator of the harvesting vessel makes such 
assertion and produces an individual permit that covers that specific 
research, the authorized officer or CCAMLR inspector will not disturb 
the area, but will record the information pertaining to the denial of 
access.
    (2) The owner and operator of each harvesting vessel must provide to 
authorized officers and CCAMLR inspectors all records and documents 
pertaining to the harvesting activities of the vessel, including but not 
limited to production records, fishing logs, navigation logs, transfer 
records, product receipts, cargo stowage plans or records, draft or 
displacement calculations, customs documents or records, and an accurate 
hold plan reflecting the current structure of the vessel's storage and 
factory spaces.
    (3) Before leaving vessels that have been inspected, the CCAMLR 
inspector will give the master of the vessel a Certificate of Inspection 
and a written notification of any alleged violations of Commission 
measures in effect and will afford the master the opportunity to comment 
on it. The ship's master must sign the notification to acknowledge 
receipt and the opportunity to comment on it.
    (b) Reports by non-inspectors. All scientists, fishermen, and other 
non-inspectors present in the Convention area and subject to the 
jurisdiction of the United States are encouraged to report any violation 
of Commission conservation and management measures observed in the 
Convention area to the Office of Ocean Affairs (CCAMLR Violations), 
Department of State, Room 5801, Washington, DC 20520.
    (c) Storage of AMLRs. The operator of each harvesting vessel storing 
AMLRs in a storage space on board the vessel must ensure that non-
resource items are neither stowed beneath nor covered by resource items, 
unless required to maintain the stability and safety of the vessel. Non-
resource items include, but are not limited to, portable conveyors, 
exhaust fans, ladders, nets, fuel bladders, extra bin boards, or other 
moveable non-resource items. These non-resource items may be in a 
resource storage space when necessary for the safety of the vessel or 
crew or for the storage of the items. Lumber, bin boards, or other 
dunnage may be used for shoring or bracing of product to ensure the 
safety of crew and to prevent shifting of cargo within the space.

container, only the outermost container must be marked in accordance 
with this section, provided, that for live fish or wildlife that are 
packed in subcontainers within a larger packing container, if the 
subcontainers are numbered or labeled, the packing list, invoice, bill 
of lading, or other similar document, must reflect that number or label.
    (4) A conveyance (truck, plane, boat, etc.) is not considered a 
container for purposes of requiring specific marking of the conveyance 
itself, provided that:
    (i) The fish or wildlife within the conveyance is carried loosely or 
is readily identifiable, and is accompanied by the document required by 
paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section; or
    (ii) The fish or wildlife is otherwise packaged and marked in 
accordance with this subpart.
    (b) The requirements of Sec. 300.160 of chapter III of this title 
do not apply to containers or packages containing--

jurisdiction of the United States, whether or not such landing, bringing 
or introduction constitutes an importation within the meaning of the 
customs laws of the United States. Import, for purposes of this subpart, 
does not include any activity described in the previous sentence with 
respect to fish caught in the exclusive economic zone or by a vessel of

United States from a U.S. insular possession, or vice-versa, are not 
considered imports.
    Importer, for purposes of this subpart, means the principal party 
responsible for the import of product into a country. For imports into 
the United States, and for purposes of this subpart, ``importer'' means 
the consignee as identified on entry documentation or any authorized, 
equivalent electronic medium required for release of shipments from the 
customs authority of the United States or the separate customs territory 
of a U.S. insular possession. If a consignee is not declared, then the 
importer of record is considered to be the consignee.
    Insular possession of the United States or U.S. insular possession, 
for purposes of this subpart, means the Commonwealth of the Northern 
Mariana Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and other possessions listed 
under 19 CFR 7.2, that are outside the customs territory of the United

HMS previously imported as an entry for consumption by that nation. A 
shipment of HMS through a country on a through bill of lading, or in 
another manner that does not enter the shipment into that country as an

Sec. 300.182  HMS international trade permit.

    (a) General. An importer, entering for consumption fish or fish 
products regulated under this subpart from any ocean area into the 
United States, or an exporter exporting or re-exporting such product, 
must possess a valid trade permit issued under this section. Importation 
of fish or fish products regulated under this subpart by nonresident 
corporations is restricted to those entities authorized under 19 CFR 
141.18. A resident agent or resident corporate surety provider, as 
specified under 19 CFR 141.18, must possess a valid trade permit when 
acting on behalf of a nonresident corporation when entering for 
consumption, exporting, or re-exporting fish or fish products regulated 
under this subpart from any ocean area.
    (b) Application. A person must apply for a permit in writing on an 
appropriate form obtained from NMFS. The application must be completed, 
signed by the applicant, and submitted with required supporting 
documents, at least 30 days before the date on which the applicant wants 
to have the permit made effective. Application forms and instructions 
for their completion are available from NMFS.
    (c) Issuance. NMFS will notify the applicant of any deficiency in 
the application, including failure to provide information or reports 
required under this subpart. If the applicant fails to correct the 
deficiency within 30 days following the date of notification, the 
application will be considered abandoned.
    (d) Duration. Any permit issued under this section is valid for the 
period specified on it, unless suspended or revoked.
    (e) Alteration. Any permit that is substantially altered, erased, or 
mutilated is invalid.
    (f) Replacement. NMFS may issue replacement permits. An application 
for a replacement permit is not considered a new application. An 
appropriate fee, consistent with paragraph (j) of this section, may be 
charged for issuance of a replacement permit.
    (g) Transfer. A permit issued under this section is not transferable 
or assignable; it is valid only for the permit holder to whom it is 
issued.
    (h) Inspection. The permit holder must keep the permit issued under 
this section at his/her principal place of business. The permit must be 
displayed for inspection upon request of any authorized officer, or any 
employee of NMFS designated by NMFS for such purpose.

modify, or deny a permit issued or sought under this section. Procedures 
governing permit sanctions and denials are found at subpart D of 15 CFR 
part 904.
    (j) Fees. NMFS may charge a fee to recover the administrative 
expenses of permit issuance. The amount of the fee is calculated, at 
least annually, in accordance with the procedures of the NOAA Finance 
Handbook, available from NMFS, for determining administrative costs of 
each special product or service. The fee may not exceed such costs and 
is specified on each application form. The appropriate fee must 
accompany each application. Failure to pay the fee will preclude 
issuance of the permit. Payment by a commercial instrument later 
determined to be insufficiently funded shall invalidate any permit.

[[Page 867]]

    (k) Change in application information. Within 30 days after any 
change in the information contained in an application submitted under 
this section, the permit holder must report the change to NMFS in 
writing. If a change in permit information is not reported within 30 
days, the permit is void as of the 31\st\ day after such change.
    (l) Renewal. Persons must apply annually for a trade permit issued 
under this section. A renewal application must be submitted to NMFS, at 
an address designated by NMFS, at least 30 days before the permit 
expiration date to avoid a lapse of permitted status. NMFS will renew a 
permit provided that: the application for the requested permit is 
complete; all reports required under the Magnuson-Stevens Act, ATCA, and 
the Tuna Conventions Act of 1950 have been submitted, including those 
required under Sec. Sec. 300.183, 300.185, 300.186, and 300.187 and

information for each consignment of fish or fish products regulated 
under this subpart, except shark fins, that is entered for consumption, 
exported, or re-exported.
    (3) A biweekly report is not required for export consignments of 
bluefin tuna when the information required on the biweekly report has 
been previously supplied on a biweekly report submitted under Sec. 
635.5(b)(2)(i)(B) of this title, provided the person required to obtain 
a trade permit under Sec. 300.182 retains, at his/her principal place 
of business for a period of 2 years from the date on which each report 
was submitted to NMFS, a copy of the biweekly report which includes the

<R05>
Sec. 300.185  Documentation, reporting and recordkeeping requirements
for consignment documents and re-export certificates.

    (a) Imports--(1) Applicability of requirements. The documentation 
requirements in paragraph (a)(2) of this section apply to all imports of 
fish or fish products regulated under this subpart, into the Customs 
territory of the United States, except shark fins, or except when 
entered as a product of an American fishery landed overseas (HTS heading 
9815). For insular possessions with customs territories separate from 
the Customs territory of the United States, documentation requirements 
in paragraph (a)(2) of this section apply only to entries for 
consumption. The reporting requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section do not apply to fish products destined from one foreign country 
to another which transit the United States or a U.S. insular possession 
and are designated as an entry type other than entry for consumption as 
defined in Sec. 300.181.
    (2) Documentation requirements. (i) All fish or fish products except 
for shark fins, regulated under this subpart, imported into the Customs 
territory of the United States or entered for consumption into a 
separate customs territory of a U.S. insular possession, must, at the 
time of presenting entry documentation for clearance by customs 
authorities (e.g., CBP Forms 7533 or 3461 or other documentation 
required by the port director) be accompanied by an original, completed, 
approved, validated, species-specific consignment document.
    (ii) Imports of bluefin tuna which were re-exported from another 
nation, must also be accompanied by an original, completed, approved, 
validated, species-specific re-export certificate.
    (iii) Imports of fish or fish products regulated under this subpart, 
other than shark fins, that were previously re-exported and were 
subdivided or consolidated with another consignment before re-export, 
must also be accompanied by an original, completed, approved, validated, 
species-specific re-export certificate.
    (iv) All other imports of fish or fish products regulated under this 
subpart, except shark fins, that have been previously re-exported from 
another nation, should have the intermediate importers certification of 
the original statistical document completed.
    (v) Consignment documents must be validated as specified in Sec. 
300.187 by a responsible government official of the flag country whose 
vessel caught the fish (regardless of where the fish are first landed). 
Re-export certificates must be validated by a responsible government 
official of the re-exporting country.
    (vi) A permit holder may not accept an import without the completed 
consignment document or re-export certificate as described in paragraphs 
(a)(2)(i) through (a)(2)(v) of this section.
    (vii) For fish or fish products except shark fins regulated under 
this subpart that are entered for consumption, the permit holder must 
provide on the original consignment document that accompanied the 
consignment the correct information and importer's certification 
specified in Sec. 300.186, and must note on the top of the consignment 
document the entry number assigned at the time of filing an entry 
summary (e.g., CBP Form 7501 or electronic equivalent) with customs 
authorities.
    (viii) Bluefin tuna, imported into the Customs territory of the 
United States or entered for consumption into the separate customs 
territory of a U.S. insular possession, from a country requiring a BCD 
tag on all such bluefin tuna available for sale, must be accompanied by 
the appropriate BCD tag issued by that country, and said BCD tag must 
remain on any bluefin tuna

[[Page 870]]

until it reaches its final destination. If the final import destination 
is the United States, which includes U.S. insular possessions, the BCD 
tag must remain on the bluefin tuna until it is cut into portions. If 
the bluefin tuna portions are subsequently packaged for domestic 
commercial use or re-export, the BCD tag number and the issuing country 
must be written legibly and indelibly on the outside of the package.
    (ix) Customs forms can be obtained by contacting the local CBP port 
office; contact information is available at www.cbp.gov. For a U.S. 
insular possession, contact the local customs office for any forms 
required for entry.
    (3) Reporting requirements. For fish or fish products regulated 
under this subpart, except shark fins, that are entered for consumption 
and whose final destination is within the United States, which includes 
U.S. insular possessions, a permit holder must submit to NMFS the 
original consignment document that accompanied the fish product as 
completed under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, to be received by NMFS 
along with the biweekly report as required under Sec. 300.183(a). A 
copy of the original completed consignment document must be submitted by 
said permit holder, to be received by NMFS, at an address designated by 
NMFS, within 24 hours of the time the fish product was entered for 
consumption into the Customs territory of the United States, or the 
separate customs territory of a U.S. insular possession.
    (b) Exports-- (1) Applicability of requirements. The documentation 
and reporting requirements of this paragraph (b) apply to exports of 
fish or fish products regulated under this subpart, except shark fins, 
that were harvested by U.S. vessels and first landed in the United 
States, or harvested by vessels of a U.S. insular possession and first 
landed in that possession. This paragraph (b) also applies to products 
of American fisheries landed overseas.
    (2) Documentation requirements. A permit holder must complete an 
original, approved, numbered, species-specific consignment document 
issued to that permit holder by NMFS for each export referenced under 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Such an individually numbered document 
is not transferable and may be used only once by the permit holder to 
which it was issued to report on a specific export consignment. A permit 
holder must provide on the consignment document the correct information 
and exporter certification. The consignment document must be validated, 
as specified in Sec. 300.187, by NMFS, or another official authorized 
by NMFS. A list of such officials may be obtained by contacting NMFS. A 
permit holder requesting U.S. validation for exports should notify NMFS 
as soon as possible after arrival of the vessel to avoid delays in 
inspection and validation of the export consignment.
    (3) Reporting requirements. A permit holder must ensure that the 
original, approved, consignment document as completed under paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section accompanies the export of such products to their 
export destination. A copy of the consignment document must be received 
by NMFS, at an address designated by NMFS, within 24 hours of the time 
the fish product was exported from the United States or a U.S. insular 
possession.
    (c) Re-exports-- (1) Applicability of requirements. The 
documentation and reporting requirements of this paragraph (c) apply to 
exports of fish or fish products regulated under this subpart, except 
shark fins, that were previously entered for consumption into the 
Customs territory of the United States or the separate customs territory 
of a U.S. insular possession, through filing the documentation specified 
in paragraph (a) of this section. The requirements of this paragraph (c) 
do not apply to fish or fish products destined from one foreign country 
to another which transit the United States or a U.S. insular possession 
and which are designated as an entry type other than entry for 
consumption as defined in Sec. 300.181.
    (2) Documentation requirements. (i) If a permit holder re-exports a 
consignment of bluefin tuna, or subdivides or consolidates a consignment 
of fish or fish products regulated under this subpart, other than shark 
fins, that was previously entered for consumption as described in 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the permit holder must complete an 
original, approved, individually numbered, species-specific re-export

[[Page 871]]

certificate issued to that permit holder by NMFS for each such re-export 
consignment. Such an individually numbered document is not transferable 
and may be used only once by the permit holder to which it was issued to 
report on a specific re-export consignment. A permit holder must provide 
on the re-export certificate the correct information and re-exporter 
certification. The permit holder must also attach the original 
consignment document that accompanied the import consignment or a copy 
of that document, and must note on the top of both the consignment 
documents and the re-export certificates the entry number assigned by 
CBP authorities at the time of filing the entry summary.
    (ii) If a consignment of fish or fish products regulated under this 
subpart, except bluefin tuna or shark fins, that was previously entered 
for consumption as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section is not 
subdivided into sub-consignments or consolidated, for each re-export 
consignment, a permit holder must complete the intermediate importer's 
certification on the original statistical document and note the entry 
number on the top of the statistical document. Such re-exports do not 
need a re-export certificate and the re-export does not require 
validation.
    (iii) Re-export certificates must be validated, as specified in 
Sec. 300.187, by NMFS or another official authorized by NMFS. A list of 
such officials may be obtained by contacting NMFS. A permit holder 
requesting validation for re-exports should notify NMFS as soon as 
possible to avoid delays in inspection and validation of the re-export 
shipment.
    (3) Reporting requirements. For each re-export, a permit holder must 
submit the original of the completed re-export certificate (if 
applicable) and the original or a copy of the original consignment 
document completed as specified under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, 
to accompany the consignment of such products to their re-export 
destination. A copy of the completed consignment document and re-export 
certificate (if applicable) must be submitted to NMFS, at an address 
designated by NMFS, and received by NMFS within 24 hours of the time the 
consignment was re-exported from the United States. For re-exports of 
untagged Atlantic bluefin tuna, the permit holder must email, fax, or 
mail a copy of the completed consignment document and re-export 
certificate to the ICCAT Secretariat and the importing nation, at 
addresses designated by NMFS, to be received by the ICCAT Secretariat 
and the importing nation, within five days of export.
    (d) Document completion. To be deemed complete, a consignment 
document or re-export certificate must be filled out according to the 
corresponding instructions for each document with all requested 
information provided.
    (e) Recordkeeping. A permit holder must retain at his or her 
principal place of business, a copy of each consignment document and re-
export certificate required to be submitted to NMFS pursuant to this 
section, and supporting records for a period of 2 years from the date on 
which it was submitted to NMFS.
    (f) Inspection. Any person responsible for importing, exporting, 
storing, packing, or selling fish or fish products regulated under this 
subpart, including permit holders, consignees, customs brokers, freight 
forwarders, and importers of record, shall be subject to the inspection 
provisions at Sec. 300.183(d).

Sec. 300.186  Completed and approved documents.

    (a) NMFS-approved consignment documents and re-export certificates. 
A NMFS-approved consignment document or re-export certificate may be 
obtained from NMFS to accompany exports of fish or fish products 
regulated under this subpart from the Customs territory of the United 
States or the separate customs territory of a U.S. insular possession.
    (b) Nationally approved forms from other countries. A nationally 
approved form from another country may be used for exports to the United 
States if that document strictly conforms to the information 
requirements and format of the applicable RFMO documents. An approved 
consignment document or re-

[[Page 872]]

export certificate for use in countries without a nationally approved 
form to accompany consignments to the United States may be obtained from 
the following websites, as appropriate: www.iccat.org, www.iattc.org, 
www.ccsbt.org, or www.iotc.org.

<R05>
Sec. 300.187  Validation requirements.

    (a) Imports. The approved consignment document accompanying any 
import of any fish or fish product regulated under this subpart must be 
validated by a government official from the issuing country, unless NMFS 
waives this requirement pursuant to an applicable RFMO recommendation. 
NMFS will furnish a list of countries for which government validation 
requirements are waived to the appropriate customs officials. Such list 
will indicate the circumstances of exemption for each issuing country 
and the non-government institutions, if any, accredited to validate 
statistical documents and re-export certificates for that country.
    (b) Exports. The approved consignment document accompanying any 
export of fish or fish products regulated under this subpart must be 
validated, except pursuant to a waiver described in paragraph (d) of 
this section. Validation must be made by NMFS or another official 
authorized by NMFS.
    (c) Re-exports. The approved re-export certificate accompanying any 
re-export of fish or fish products regulated under this subpart, as 
required under Sec. 300.185(c), must be validated, except pursuant to a 
waiver described in paragraph (d) of this section. Validation must be 
made by NMFS or another official authorized by NMFS.
    (d) Validation waiver. Any waiver of government validation will be 
consistent with applicable RFMO recommendations concerning validation of 
consignment documents and re-export certificates. If authorized, such 
waiver of government validation may include exemptions from government 
validation for Pacific bluefin tuna with individual BCD tags affixed 
pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section or for Atlantic bluefin tuna 
with tags affixed pursuant to Sec. 635.5(b) of this title. Waivers will 
be specified on consignment documents and re-export certificates or 
accompanying instructions, or in a letter to permit holders from NMFS.
    (e) Authorization for non-NMFS validation. An official from an 
organization or government agency seeking authorization to validate 
consignment documents or re-export certificates accompanying exports or 
re-exports from the United States, which includes U.S. commonwealths, 
territories, and possessions, must apply in writing, to NMFS, at an 
address designated by NMFS for such authorization. The application must 
indicate the procedures to be used for verification of information to be 
validated; list the names, addresses, and telephone/fax numbers of 
individuals to perform validation; procedures to be used to notify NMFS 
of validations; and an example of the stamp or seal to be applied to the 
consignment document or re-export certificate. NMFS, upon finding the 
applicant capable of verifying the information required on the 
consignment document or re-export certificate, will issue, within 30 
days, a letter specifying the duration of effectiveness and conditions 
of authority to validate consignment documents or re-export certificates 
accompanying exports or re-exports from the United States. The effective 
date of such authorization will be delayed as necessary for NMFS to 
notify the appropriate RFMO of other officials authorized to validate 
consignment document or re-export certificates. Non-government 
organizations given authorization to validate consignment documents or 
re-export certificates must renew such authorization on a yearly basis.
    (f) BCD tags--(1) Issuance. NMFS will issue numbered BCD tags for 
use on Pacific bluefin tuna upon request to each permit holder.
    (2) Transfer. BCD tags issued under this section are not 
transferable and are usable only by the permit holder to whom they are 
issued.
    (3) Affixing BCD tags. At the discretion of permit holders, a tag 
issued under this section may be affixed to each Pacific bluefin tuna 
purchased or received by the permit holder. If so tagged, the tag must 
be affixed to the

[[Page 873]]

tuna between the fifth dorsal finlet and the keel.
    (4) Removal of tags. A tag, as defined in this subpart and affixed 
to any bluefin tuna, must remain on the tuna until it is cut into 
portions. If the bluefin tuna or bluefin tuna parts are subsequently 
packaged for transport for domestic commercial use or for export, the 
number of each dealer tag or BCD tag must be written legibly and 
indelibly on the outside of any package containing the bluefin tuna or 
bluefin tuna parts. Such tag number also must be recorded on any 
document accompanying the consignment of bluefin tuna or bluefin tuna 
parts for commercial use or export.
    (5) Labeling. The number of a BCD tag affixed to each Pacific 
bluefin tuna under this section must be recorded on NMFS reports 
required by Sec. 300.183, on any documents accompanying the consignment 
of Pacific bluefin tuna for domestic commercial use or export as 
indicated in Sec. 300.185, and on any additional documents that 
accompany the consignment (e.g., bill of lading, customs manifest, etc.) 
of the tuna for commercial use or for export.
    (6) Reuse. BCD tags issued under this section are separately 
numbered and may be used only once, one tag per Pacific bluefin tuna, to 
distinguish the purchase of one Pacific bluefin tuna. Once affixed to a 
tuna or recorded on any package, container or report, a BCD tag and 
associated number may not be reused.

Sec. 300.188  Ports of entry.

    NMFS shall monitor the importation of fish or fish products 
regulated under this subpart into the United States. If NMFS determines 
that the diversity of handling practices at certain ports at which fish 
or fish products regulated under this subpart are being imported into 
the United States allows for circumvention of the consignment document 
requirement, NMFS may undertake a rulemaking to designate, after 
consultation with the CBP, those ports at which fish or fish products 
regulated under this subpart from any ocean area may be imported into 
the United States.

                            Subpart A_General


<R05>
Sec. 402.01  Scope.

    (a) This part interprets and implements sections 7(a)-(d) [16 U.S.C. 
1536(a)-(d)] of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended 
(``Act''). Section 7(a) grants authority to and imposes requirements 
upon Federal agencies regarding endangered or threatened species of 
fish, wildlife, or plants (``listed species'') and habitat of such 
species that has been designated as critical (``critical habitat''). 
Section 7(a)(1) of the Act directs Federal agencies, in consultation 
with and with the assistance of the Secretary of the Interior or of 
Commerce, as appropriate, to utilize their authorities to further the 
purposes of the Act by carrying out conservation programs for listed 
species. Such affirmative conservation programs must comply with 
applicable permit requirements (50 CFR parts 17, 220, 222, and 227) for 
listed species and should be coordinated with the appropriate Secretary. 
Section 7(a)(2) of the Act requires every Federal agency, in 
consultation with and with the assistance of the Secretary, to insure 
that

[[Page 881]]

any action it authorizes, funds, or carries out, in the United States or 
upon the high seas, is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence 
of any listed species or results in the destruction or adverse 
modification of critical habitat. Section 7(a)(3) of the Act authorizes 
a prospective permit or license applicant to request the issuing Federal 
agency to enter into early consultation with the Service on a proposed 
action to determine whether such action is likely to jeopardize the 
continued existence of listed species or result in the destruction or 
adverse modification of critical habitat. Section 7(a)(4) of the Act 
requires Federal agencies to confer with the Secretary on any action 
that is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of proposed species 
or result in the destruction or adverse modification of proposed 
critical habitat. Section 7(b) of the Act requires the Secretary, after 
the conclusion of early or formal consultation, to issue a written 
statement setting forth the Secretary's opinion detailing how the agency 
action affects listed species or critical habitat Biological assessments 
are required under section 7(c) of the Act if listed species or critical 
habitat may be present in the area affected by any major construction 
activity as defined in Sec. 404.02. Section 7(d) of the Act prohibits 
Federal agencies and applicants from making any irreversible or 
irretrievable commitment of resources which has the effect of 
foreclosing the formulation or implementation of reasonable and prudent 
alternatives which would avoid jeopardizing the continued existence of 
listed species or resulting in the destruction or adverse modification 
of critical habitat. Section 7(e)-(o)(1) of the Act provide procedures 
for granting exemptions from the requirements of section 7(a)(2). 
Regulations governing the submission of exemption applications are found 
at 50 CFR part 451, and regulations governing the exemption process are 
found at 50 CFR parts 450, 452, and 453.
    (b) The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine 
Fisheries Service (NMFS) share responsibilities for administering the 
Act. The Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants are 
found in 50 CFR 17.11 and 17.12 and the designated critical habitats are 
found in 50 CFR 17.95 and 17.96 and 50 CFR part 226. Endangered or 
threatened species under the jurisdiction of the NMFS are located in 50 
CFR 222.23(a) and 227.4. If the subject species is cited in 50 CFR 
222.23(a) or 227.4, the Federal agency shall contact the NMFS. For all 
other listed species the Federal Agency shall contact the FWS.


<R05>
Sec. 402.02  Definitions.

    Act means the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended, 16 U.S.C. 
1531 et seq.
    Action means all activities or programs of any kind authorized, 
funded, or carried out, in whole or in part, by Federal agencies in the 
United States or upon the high seas. Examples include, but are not 
limited to:
    (a) actions intended to conserve listed species or their habitat;
    (b) the promulgation of regulations;
    (c) the granting of licenses, contracts, leases, easements, rights-
of-way, permits, or grants-in-aid; or
    (d) actions directly or indirectly causing modifications to the 
land, water, or air.
    Action area means all areas to be affected directly or indirectly by 
the Federal action and not merely the immediate area involved in the 
action.
    Applicant refers to any person, as defined in section 3(13) of the 
Act, who requires formal approval or authorization from a Federal agency 
as a prerequisite to conducting the action.
    Biological assessment refers to the information prepared by or under 
the direction of the Federal agency concerning listed and proposed 
species and designated and proposed critical habitat that may be present 
in the action area and the evaluation potential effects of the action on 
such species and habitat.
    Biological opinion is the document that states the opinion of the 
Service as to whether or not the Federal action is likely to jeopardize 
the continued existence of listed species or result in the destruction 
or adverse modification of critical habitat.
    Conference is a process which involves informal discussions between 
a Federal agency and the Service under section

[[Page 882]]

7(a)(4) of the Act regarding the impact of an action on proposed species 
or proposed critical habitat and recommendations to minimize or avoid 
the adverse effects.
    Conservation recommendations are suggestions of the Service 
regarding discretionary measures to minimize or avoid adverse effects of 
a proposed action on listed species or critical habitat or regarding the 
development of information.
    Critical habitat refers to an area designated as critical habitat 
listed in 50 CFR parts 17 or 226.
    Cumulative effects are those effects of future State or private 
activities, not involving Federal activities, that are reasonably 
certain to occur within the action area of the Federal action subject to 
consultation.
    Designated non-Federal representative refers to a person designated 
by the Federal agency as its representative to conduct informal 
consultation and/or to prepare any biological assessment.
    Destruction or adverse modification means a direct or indirect 
alteration that appreciably diminishes the value of critical habitat for 
both the survival and recovery of a listed species. Such alterations 
include, but are not limited to, alterations adversely modifying any of 
those physical or biological features that were the basis for 
determining the habitat to be critical.
    Director refers to the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries for the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or his authorized 
representative; or the Fish and Wildlife Service regional director, or 
his authorized representative, for the region where the action would be 
carried out.
    Early consultation is a process requested by a Federal agency on 
behalf of a prospective applicant under section 7(a)(3) of the Act.
    Effects of the action refers to the direct and indirect effects of 
an action on the species or critical habitat, together with the effects 
of other activities that are interrelated or interdependent with that 
action, that will be added to the environmental baseline. The 
environmental baseline includes the past and present impacts of all 
Federal, State, or private actions and other human activities in the 
action area, the anticipated impacts of all proposed Federal projects in 
the action area that have already undergone formal or early section 7 
consultation, and the impact of State or private actions which are 
contemporaneous with the consultation in process. Indirect effects are 
those that are caused by the proposed action and are later in time, but 
still are reasonably certain to occur. Interrelated actions are those 
that are part of a larger action and depend on the larger action for 
their justification. Interdependent actions are those that have no 
independent utility apart from the action under consideration.
    Formal consultation is a process between the Service and the Federal 
agency that commences with the Federal agency's written request for 
consultation under section 7(a)(2) of the Act and concludes with the 
Service's issuance of the biological opinion under section 7(b)(3) of 
the Act.
    Incidental take refers to takings that result from, but are not the 
purpose of, carrying out an otherwise lawful activity conducted by the 
Federal agency or applicant.
    Informal consultation is an optional process that includes all 
discussions, correspondence, etc., between the Service and the Federal 
agency or the designated non-Federal representative prior to formal 
consultation, if required.
    Jeopardize the continued existence of means to engage in an action 
that reasonably would be expected, directly or indirectly, to reduce 
appreciably the likelihood of both the survival and recovery of a listed 
species in the wild by reducing the reproduction, numbers, or 
distribution of that species.
    Listed species means any species of fish, wildlife, or plant which 
has been determined to be endangered or threatened under section 4 of 
the Act. Listed species are found in 50 CFR 17.11-17.12.
    Major construction activity is a construction project (or other 
undertaking having similar physical impacts) which is a major Federal 
action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment as 
referred to in the National Environmental Policy Act [NEPA, 42 U.S.C. 
4332(2)(C)].

[[Page 883]]

    Preliminary biological opinion refers to an opinion issued as a 
result of early consultation.
    Proposed critical habitat means habitat proposed in the Federal 
Register to be designated or revised as critical habitat under section 4 
of the Act for any listed or proposed species.
    Proposed species means any species of fish, wildlife, or plant that 
is proposed in the Federal Register to be listed under section 4 of the 
Act.
    Reasonable and prudent alternatives refer to alternative actions 
identified during formal consultation that can be implemented in a 
manner consistent with the intended purpose of the action, that can be 
implemented consistent with the scope of the Federal agency's legal 
authority and jurisdiction, that is economically and technologically 
feasible, and that the Director believes would avoid the likelihood of 
jeopardizing the continued existence of listed species or resulting in 
the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat.
    Reasonable and prudent measures refer to those actions the Director 
believes necessary or appropriate to minimize the impacts, i.e., amount 
or extent, of incidental take.
    Recovery means improvement in the status of listed species to the 
point at which listing is no longer appropriate under the criteria set 
out in section 4(a)(1) of the Act.
    Service means the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service or the National 
Marine Fisheries Service, as appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 402.03  Applicability.

    Section 7 and the requirements of this part apply to all actions in 
which there is discretionary Federal involvement or control.


<R05>
Sec. 402.04  Counterpart regulations.

    The consultation procedures set forth in this part may be superseded 
for a particular Federal agency by joint counterpart regulations among 
that agency, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the National Marine 
Fisheries Service. Such counterpart regulations shall be published in 
the Federal Register in proposed form and shall be subject to public 
comment for at least 60 days before final rules are published.


<R05>
Sec. 402.05  Emergencies.

    (a) Where emergency circumstances mandate the need to consult in an 
expedited manner, consultation may be conducted informally through 
alternative procedures that the Director determines to be consistent 
with the requirements of sections 7(a)-(d) of the Act. This provision 
applies to situations involving acts of God, disasters, casualties, 
national defense or security emergencies, etc.
    (b) Formal consultation shall be initiated as soon as practicable 
after the emergency is under control. The Federal agency shall submit 
information on the nature of the emergency action(s), the justification 
for the expedited consultation, and the impacts to endangered or 
threatened species and their habitats. The Service will evaluate such 
information and issue a biological opinion including the information and 
recommendations given during the emergency consultation.


<R05>
Sec. 402.06  Coordination with other environmental reviews.

    (a) Consultation, conference, and biological assessment procedures 
under section 7 may be consolidated with interagency cooperation 
procedures required by other statutes, such as the National 
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq., implemented at 
40 CFR Parts 1500-1508) or the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act (FWCA) 
(16 U.S.C. 661 et seq.). Satisfying the requirements of these other 
statutes, however, does not in itself relieve a Federal agency of its 
obligations to comply with the procedures set forth in this part or the 
substantive requirements of section 7. The Service will attempt to 
provide a coordinated review and analysis of all environmental 
requirements.
    (b) Where the consultation or conference has been consolidated with 
the interagency cooperation procedures required by other statutes such 
as NEPA or FWCA, the results should be included in the documents 
required by those statutes.

[[Page 884]]


<R05>
Sec. 402.07  Designation of lead agency.

    When a particular action involves more than one Federal agency, the 
consultation and conference responsibilities may be fulfilled through a 
lead agency. Factors relevant in determining an appropriate lead agency 
include the time sequence in which the agencies would become involved, 
the magnitude of their respective involvement, and their relative 
expertise with respect to the environmental effects of the action. The 
Director shall be notified of the designation in writing by the lead 
agency.


<R05>
Sec. 402.08  Designation of non-Federal representative.

    A Federal agency may designate a non-Federal representative to 
conduct informal consultation or prepare a biological assessment by 
giving written notice to the Director of such designation. If a permit 
or license applicant is involved and is not the designated non-Federal 
representative, then the applicant and Federal agency must agree on the 
choice of the designated non-Federal representative. If a biological 
assessment is prepared by the designated non-Federal representative, the 
Federal agency shall furnish guidance and supervision and shall 
independently review and evaluate the scope and contents of the 
biological assessment. The ultimate responsibility for compliance with 
section 7 remains with the Federal agency.


<R05>
Sec. 402.09  Irreversible or irretrievable commitment of resources.

    After initiation or reinitiation of consultation required under 
section 7(a)(2) of the Act, the Federal agency and any applicant shall 
make no irreversible or irretrievable commitment of resources with 
respect to the agency action which has the effect of foreclosing the 
formulation or implementation of any reasonable and prudent alternatives 
which would avoid violating section 7(a)(2). This prohibition is in 
force during the consultation process and continues until the 
requirements of section 7(a)(2) are satisfied. This provision does not 
apply to the conference requirement for proposed species or proposed 
critical habitat under section 7(a)(4) of the Act.


<R04>
                    Subpart B_Consultation Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 402.10  Conference on proposed species or proposed critical habitat.

    (a) Each Federal agency shall confer with the Service on any action 
which is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any proposed 
species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of proposed 
critical habitat. The conference is designed to assist the Federal 
agency and any applicant in identifying and resolving potential 
conflicts at an early stage in the planning process.
    (b) The Federal agency shall initiate the conference with the 
Director. The Service may request a conference if, after a review of 
available information, it determines that a conference is required for a 
particular action.
    (c) A conference between a Federal agency and the Service shall 
consist of informal discussions concerning an action that is likely to 
jeopardize the continued existence of the proposed species or result in 
the destruction or adverse modification of the proposed critical habitat 
at issue. Applicants may be involved in these informal discussions to 
the greatest extent practicable. During the conference, the Service will 
make advisory recommendations, if any, on ways to minimize or avoid 
adverse effects. If the proposed species is subsequently listed or the 
proposed critical habitat is designated prior to completion of the 
action, the Federal agency must review the action to determine whether 
formal consultation is required.
    (d) If requested by the Federal agency and deemed appropriate by the 
Service, the conference may be conducted in accordance with the 
procedures for formal consultation in Sec. 402.14. An opinion issued at 
the conclusion of the conference may be adopted as the biological 
opinion when the species is listed or critical habitat is designated, 
but only if no significant new information is developed (including that 
developed during the rulemaking process on the proposed listing or 
critical habitat designation) and no significant changes to the Federal 
action are made that would alter the content of the opinion. An 
incidental take statement provided with

[[Page 885]]

a conference opinion does not become effective unless the Service adopts 
the opinion once the listing is final.
    (e) The conclusions reached during a conference and any 
recommendations shall be documented by the Service and provided to the 
Federal agency and to any applicant. The style and magnitude of this 
document will vary with the complexity of the conference. If formal 
consultation also is required for a particular action, then the Service 
will provide the results of the conference with the biological opinion.


<R05>
Sec. 402.11  Early consultation.

    (a) Purpose. Early consultation is designed to reduce the likelihood 
of conflicts between listed species or critical habitat and proposed 
actions and occurs prior to the filing of an application for a Federal 
permit or license. Although early consultation is conducted between the 
Service and the Federal agency, the prospective applicant should be 
involved throughout the consultation process.
    (b) Request by prospective applicant. If a prospective applicant has 
reason to believe that the prospective action may affect listed species 
or critical habitat, it may request the Federal agency to enter into 
early consultation with the Service. The prospective applicant must 
certify in writing to the Federal agency that (1) it has a definitive 
proposal outlining the action and its effects and (2) it intends to 
implement its proposal, if authorized.
    (c) Initiation of early consultation. If the Federal agency receives 
the prospective applicant's certification in paragraph (b) of this 
section, then the Federal agency shall initiate early consultation with 
the Service. This request shall be in writing and contain the 
information outlined in Sec. 402.14(c) and, if the action is a major 
construction activity, the biological assessment as outlined in Sec. 
402.12.
    (d) Procedures and responsibilities. The procedures and 
responsibilities for early consultation are the same as outlined in 
Sec. 402.14(c)-(j) for formal consultation, except that all references 
to the ``applicant'' shall be treated as the ``prospective applicant'' 
and all references to the ``biological opinion'' or the ``opinion'' 
shall be treated as the ``preliminary biological opinion'' for the 
purpose of this section.
    (e) Preliminary biological opinion. The contents and conclusions of 
a preliminary biological opinion are the same as for a biological 
opinion issued after formal consultation except that the incidental take 
statement provided with a preliminary biological opinion does not 
constitute authority to take listed species.
    (f) Confirmation of preliminary biological opinion as final 
biological opinion. A preliminary biological opinion may be confirmed as 
a biological opinion issued after formal consultation if the Service 
reviews the proposed action and finds that there have been no 
significant changes in the action as planned or in the information used 
during the early consultation. A written request for confirmation of the 
preliminary biological opinion should be submitted after the prospective 
applicant applies to the Federal agency for a permit or license but 
prior to the issuance of such permit or license. Within 45 days of 
receipt of the Federal agency's request, the Service shall either:
    (1) Confirm that the preliminary biological opinion stands as a 
final biological opinion; or
    (2) If the findings noted above cannot be made, request that the 
Federal agency initiate formal consultation.


<R05>
Sec. 402.12  Biological assessments.

    (a) Purpose. A biological assessment shall evaluate the potential 
effects of the action on listed and proposed species and designated and 
proposed critical habitat and determine whether any such species or 
habitat are likely to be adversely affected by the action and is used in 
determining whether formal consultation or a conference is necessary.
    (b) Preparation requirement. (1) The procedures of this section are 
required for Federal actions that are ``major construction activities''; 
provided that a contract for construction was not entered into or actual 
construction was not begun on or before November 10, 1978. Any person, 
including those who may wish to apply for an exemption from section 
7(a)(2) of the Act, may prepare a biological assessment under

[[Page 886]]

the supervision of the Federal agency and in cooperation with the 
Service consistent with the procedures and requirements of this section. 
An exemption from the requirements of section 7(a)(2) is not permanent 
unless a biological assessment has been prepared.
    (2) The biological assessment shall be completed before any contract 
for construction is entered into and before construction is begun.
    (c) Request for information. The Federal agency or the designated 
non-Federal representative shall convey to the Director either (1) a 
written request for a list of any listed or proposed species or 
designated or proposed critical habitat that may be present in the 
action area; or (2) a written notification of the species and critical 
habitat that are being included in the biological assessment.
    (d) Director's response. Within 30 days of receipt of the 
notification of, or the request for, a species list, the Director shall 
either concur with or revise the list or, in those cases where no list 
has been provided, advise the Federal agency or the designated non-
Federal representative in writing whether, based on the best scientific 
and commercial data available, any listed or proposed species or 
designated or proposed critical habitat may be present in the action 
area. In addition to listed and proposed species, the Director will 
provide a list of candidate species that may be present in the action 
area. Candidate species refers to any species being considered by the 
Service for listing as endangered or threatened species but not yet the 
subject of a proposed rule. Although candidate species have no legal 
status and are accorded no protection under the Act, their inclusion 
will alert the Federal agency of potential proposals or listings.
    (1) If the Director advises that no listed species or critical 
habitat may be present, the Federal agency need not prepare a biological 
assessment and further consultation is not required. If only proposed 
species or proposed critical habitat may be present in the action area, 
then the Federal agency must confer with the Service if required under 
Sec. 402.10, but preparation of a biological assessment is not required 
unless the proposed listing and/or designation becomes final.
    (2) If a listed species or critical habitat may be present in the 
action area, the Director will provide a species list or concur with the 
species list provided. The Director also will provide available 
information (or references thereto) regarding these species and critical 
habitat, and may recommend discretionary studies or surveys that may 
provide a better information base for the preparation of an assessment. 
Any recommendation for studies or surveys is not to be construed as the 
Service's opinion that the Federal agency has failed to satisfy the 
information standard of section 7(a)(2) of the Act.
    (e) Verification of current accuracy of species list. If the Federal 
agency or the designated non-Federal representative does not begin 
preparation of the biological assessment within 90 days of receipt of 
(or concurrence with) the species list, the Federal agency or the 
designated non-Federal representative must verify (formally or 
informally) with the Service the current accuracy of the species list at 
the time the preparation of the assessment is begun.
    (f) Contents. The contents of a biological assessment are at the 
discretion of the Federal agency and will depend on the nature of the 
Federal action. The following may be considered for inclusion:
    (1) The results of an on-site inspection of the area affected by the 
action to determine if listed or proposed species are present or occur 
seasonally.
    (2) The views of recognized experts on the species at issue.
    (3) A review of the literature and other information.
    (4) An analysis of the effects of the action on the species and 
habitat, including consideration of cumulative effects, and the results 
of any related studies.
    (5) An analysis of alternate actions considered by the Federal 
agency for the proposed action.
    (g) Incorporation by reference. If a proposed action requiring the 
preparation of a biological assessment is identical, or very similar, to 
a previous action for which a biological assessment was prepared, the 
Federal agency may fulfill

[[Page 887]]

the biological assessment requirement for the proposed action by 
incorporating by reference the earlier biological assessment, plus any 
supporting data from other documents that are pertinent to the 
consultation, into a written certification that:
    (1) The proposed action involves similar impacts to the same species 
in the same geographic area;
    (2) No new species have been listed or proposed or no new critical 
habitat designated or proposed for the action area; and
    (3) The biological assessment has been supplemented with any 
relevant changes in information.
    (h) Permit requirements. If conducting a biological assessment will 
involve the taking of a listed species, a permit under section 10 of the 
Act (16 U.S.C. 1539) and part 17 of this title (with respect to species 
under the jurisdiction of the FWS) or parts 220, 222, and 227 of this 
title (with respect to species under the jurisdiction of the NMFS) is 
required.
    (i) Completion time. The Federal agency or the designated non- 
Federal representative shall complete the biological assessment within 
180 days after its initiation (receipt of or concurrence with the 
species list) unless a different period of time is agreed to by the 
Director and the Federal agency. If a permit or license applicant is 
involved, the 180-day period may not be extended unless the agency 
provides the applicant, before the close of the 180-day period, with a 
written statement setting forth the estimated length of the proposed 
extension and the reasons why such an extension is necessary.
    (j) Submission of biological assessment. The Federal agency shall 
submit the completed biological assessment to the Director for review. 
The Director will respond in writing within 30 days as to whether or not 
he concurs with the findings of the biological assessment. At the option 
of the Federal agency, formal consultation may be initiated under Sec. 
402.14(c) concurrently with the submission of the assessment.
    (k) Use of the biological assessment. (1) The Federal agency shall 
use the biological assessment in determining whether formal consultation 
or a conference is required under Sec. 402.14 or Sec. 402.10, 
respectively. If the biological assessment indicates that there are no 
listed species or critical habitat present that are likely to be 
adversely affected by the action and the Director concurs as specified 
in paragraph (j) of this section, then formal consultation is not 
required. If the biological assessment indicates that the action is not 
likely to jeopardize the continued existence of proposed species or 
result in the destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical 
habitat, and the Director concurs, then a conference is not required.
    (2) The Director may use the results of the biological assessment in 
(i) determining whether to request the Federal agency to initiate formal 
consultation or a conference, (ii) formulating a biological opinion, or 
(iii) formulating a preliminary biological opinion.


<R05>
Sec. 402.13  Informal consultation.

    (a) Informal consultation is an optional process that includes all 
discussions, correspondence, etc., between the Service and the Federal 
agency or the designated non-Federal representative, designed to assist 
the Federal agency in determining whether formal consultation or a 
conference is required. If during informal consultation it is determined 
by the Federal agency, with the written concurrence of the Service, that 
the action is not likely to adversely affect listed species or critical 
habitat, the consultation process is terminated, and no further action 
is necessary.
    (b) During informal consultation, the Service may suggest 
modifications to the action that the Federal agency and any applicant 
could implement to avoid the likelihood of adverse effects to listed 
species or critical habitat.


<R05>
Sec. 402.14  Formal consultation.

    (a) Requirement for formal consultation. Each Federal agency shall 
review its actions at the earliest possible time to determine whether 
any action may affect listed species or critical habitat. If such a 
determination is made, formal consultation is required, except as noted 
in paragraph (b) of this section. The Director may request a Federal 
agency to enter into consultation if he

[[Page 888]]

identifies any action of that agency that may affect listed species or 
critical habitat and for which there has been no consultation. When such 
a request is made, the Director shall forward to the Federal agency a 
written explanation of the basis for the request.
    (b) Exceptions. (1) A Federal agency need not initiate formal 
consultation if, as a result of the preparation of a biological 
assessment under Sec. 402.12 or as a result of informal consultation 
with the Service under Sec. 402.13, the Federal agency determines, with 
the written concurrence of the Director, that the proposed action is not 
likely to adversely affect any listed species or critical habitat.
    (2) A Federal agency need not initiate formal consultation if a 
preliminary biological opinion, issued after early consultation under 
Sec. 402.11, is confirmed as the final biological opinion.
    (c) Initiation of formal consultation. A written request to initiate 
formal consultation shall be submitted to the Director and shall 
include:
    (1) A description of the action to be considered;
    (2) A description of the specific area that may be affected by the 
action;
    (3) A description of any listed species or critical habitat that may 
be affected by the action;
    (4) A description of the manner in which the action may affect any 
listed species or critical habitat and an analysis of any cumulative 
effects;
    (5) Relevant reports, including any environmental impact statement, 
environmental assessment, or biological assessment prepared; and
    (6) Any other relevant available information on the action, the 
affected listed species, or critical habitat.

Formal consultation shall not be initiated by the Federal agency until 
any required biological assessment has been completed and submitted to 
the Director in accordance with Sec. 402.12. Any request for formal 
consultation may encompass, subject to the approval of the Director, a 
number of similar individual actions within a given geographical area or 
a segment of a comprehensive plan. This does not relieve the Federal 
agency of the requirements for considering the effects of the action as 
a whole.
    (d) Responsibility to provide best scientific and commercial data 
available. The Federal agency requesting formal consultation shall 
provide the Service with the best scientific and commercial data 
available or which can be obtained during the consultation for an 
adequate review of the effects that an action may have upon listed 
species or critical habitat. This information may include the results of 
studies or surveys conducted by the Federal agency or the designated 
non-Federal representative. The Federal agency shall provide any 
applicant with the opportunity to submit information for consideration 
during the consultation.
    (e) Duration and extension of formal consultation. Formal 
consultation concludes within 90 days after its initiation unless 
extended as provided below. If an applicant is not involved, the Service 
and the Federal agency may mutually agree to extend the consultation for 
a specific time period. If an applicant is involved, the Service and the 
Federal agency may mutually agree to extend the consultation provided 
that the Service submits to the applicant, before the close of the 90 
days, a written statement setting forth:
    (1) The reasons why a longer period is required,
    (2) The information that is required to complete the consultation, 
and
    (3) The estimated date on which the consultation will be completed.

A consultation involving an applicant cannot be extended for more than 
60 days without the consent of the applicant. Within 45 days after 
concluding formal consultation, the Service shall deliver a biological 
opinion to the Federal agency and any applicant.
    (f) Additional data. When the Service determines that additional 
data would provide a better information base from which to formulate a 
biological opinion, the Director may request an extension of formal 
consultation and request that the Federal agency obtain additional data 
to determine how or to what extent the action may affect listed species 
or critical habitat. If formal consultation is extended by mutual 
agreement according to Sec. 402.14(e), the

[[Page 889]]

Federal agency shall obtain, to the extent practicable, that data which 
can be developed within the scope of the extension. The responsibility 
for conducting and funding any studies belongs to the Federal agency and 
the applicant, not the Service. The Service's request for additional 
data is not to be construed as the Service's opinion that the Federal 
agency has failed to satisfy the information standard of section 7(a)(2) 
of the Act. If no extension of formal consultation is agreed to, the 
Director will issue a biological opinion using the best scientific and 
commercial data available.
    (g) Service responsibilities. Service responsibilities during formal 
consultation are as follows:
    (1) Review all relevant information provided by the Federal agency 
or otherwise available. Such review may include an on-site inspection of 
the action area with representatives of the Federal agency and the 
applicant.
    (2) Evaluate the current status of the listed species or critical 
habitat.
    (3) Evaluate the effects of the action and cumulative effects on the 
listed species or critical habitat.
    (4) Formulate its biological opinion as to whether the action, taken 
together with cumulative effects, is likely to jeopardize the continued 
existence of listed species or result in the destruction or adverse 
modification of critical habitat.
    (5) Discuss with the Federal agency and any applicant the Service's 
review and evaluation conducted under paragraphs (g)(1) through (3) of 
this section, the basis for any finding in the biological opinion, and 
the availability of reasonable and prudent alternatives (if a jeopardy 
opinion is to be issued) that the agency and the applicant can take to 
avoid violation of section 7(a)(2). The Service will utilize the 
expertise of the Federal agency and any applicant in identifying these 
alternatives. If requested, the Service shall make available to the 
Federal agency the draft biological opinion for the purpose of analyzing 
the reasonable and prudent alternatives. The 45-day period in which the 
biological opinion must be delivered will not be suspended unless the 
Federal agency secures the written consent of the applicant to an 
extension to a specific date. The applicant may request a copy of the 
draft opinion from the Federal agency. All comments on the draft 
biological opinion must be submitted to the Service through the Federal 
agency, although the applicant may send a copy of its comments directly 
to the Service. The Service will not issue its biological opinion prior 
to the 45-day or extended deadline while the draft is under review by 
the Federal agency. However, if the Federal agency submits comments to 
the Service regarding the draft biological opinion within 10 days of the 
deadline for issuing the opinion, the Service is entitled to an 
automatic 10-day extension on the deadline.
    (6) Formulate discretionary conservation recommendations, if any, 
which will assist the Federal agency in reducing or eliminating the 
impacts that its proposed action may have on listed species or critical 
habitat.
    (7) Formulate a statement concerning incidental take, if such take 
may occur.
    (8) In formulating its biological opinion, any reasonable and 
prudent alternatives, and any reasonable and prudent measures, the 
Service will use the best scientific and commercial data available and 
will give appropriate consideration to any beneficial actions taken by 
the Federal agency or applicant, including any actions taken prior to 
the initiation of consultation.
    (h) Biological opinions. The biological opinion shall include:
    (1) A summary of the information on which the opinion is based;
    (2) A detailed discussion of the effects of the action on listed 
species or critical habitat; and
    (3) The Service's opinion on whether the action is likely to 
jeopardize the continued existence of a listed species or result in the 
destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat (a ``jeopardy 
biological opinion''); or, the action is not likely to jeopardize the 
continued existence of a listed species or result in the destruction or 
adverse modification of critical habitat (a ``no jeopardy'' biological 
opinion). A ``jeopardy'' biological opinion shall include reasonable and 
prudent alternatives, if any. If the Service is unable to develop such 
alternatives, it will indicate that

[[Page 890]]

to the best of its knowledge there are no reasonable and prudent 
alternatives.
    (i) Incidental take. (1) In those cases where the Service concludes 
that an action (or the implementation of any reasonable and prudent 
alternatives) and the resultant incidental take of listed species will 
not violate section 7(a)(2), and, in the case of marine mammals, where 
the taking is authorized pursuant to section 101(a)(5) of the Marine 
Mammal Protection Act of 1972, the Service will provide with the 
biological opinion a statement concerning incidental take that:
    (i) Specifies the impact, i.e., the amount or extent, of such 
incidental taking on the species;
    (ii) Specifies those reasonable and prudent measures that the 
Director considers necessary or appropriate to minimize such impact;
    (iii) In the case of marine mammals, specifies those measures that 
are necessary to comply with section 101(a)(5) of the Marine Mammal 
Protection Act of 1972 and applicable regulations with regard to such 
taking;
    (iv) Sets forth the terms and conditions (including, but not limited 
to, reporting requirements) that must be complied with by the Federal 
agency or any applicant to implement the measures specified under 
paragraphs (i)(1)(ii) and (i)(1)(iii) of this section; and
    (v) Specifies the procedures to be used to handle or dispose of any 
individuals of a species actually taken.
    (2) Reasonable and prudent measures, along with the terms and 
conditions that implement them, cannot alter the basic design, location, 
scope, duration, or timing of the action and may involve only minor 
changes.
    (3) In order to monitor the impacts of incidental take, the Federal 
agency or any applicant must report the progress of the action and its 
impact on the species to the Service as specified in the incidental take 
statement. The reporting requirements will be established in accordance 
with 50 CFR 13.45 and 18.27 for FWS and 50 CFR 220.45 and 228.5 for 
NMFS.
    (4) If during the course of the action the amount or extent of 
incidental taking, as specified under paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this 
Section, is exceeded, the Federal agency must reinitiate consultation 
immediately.
    (5) Any taking which is subject to a statement as specified in 
paragraph (i)(1) of this section and which is in compliance with the 
terms and conditions of that statement is not a prohibited taking under 
the Act, and no other authorization or permit under the Act is required.
    (j) Conservation recommendations. The Service may provide with the 
biological opinion a statement containing discretionary conservation 
recommendations. Conservation recommendations are advisory and are not 
intended to carry any binding legal force.
    (k) Incremental steps. When the action is authorized by a statute 
that allows the agency to take incremental steps toward the completion 
of the action, the Service shall, if requested by the Federal agency, 
issue a biological opinion on the incremental step being considered, 
including its views on the entire action. Upon the issuance of such a 
biological opinion, the Federal agency may proceed with or authorize the 
incremental steps of the action if:
    (1) The biological opinion does not conclude that the incremental 
step would violate section 7(a)(2);
    (2) The Federal agency continues consultation with respect to the 
entire action and obtains biological opinions, as required, for each 
incremental step;
    (3) The Federal agency fulfills its continuing obligation to obtain 
sufficient data upon which to base the final biological opinion on the 
entire action;
    (4) The incremental step does not violate section 7(d) of the Act 
concerning irreversible or irretrievable commitment of resources; and
    (5) There is a reasonable likelihood that the entire action will not 
violate section 7(a)(2) of the Act.
    (l) Termination of consultation. (1) Formal consultation is 
terminated with the issuance of the biological opinion.
    (2) If during any stage of consultation a Federal agency determines 
that its proposed action is not likely to occur, the consultation may be 
terminated by written notice to the Service.
    (3) If during any stage of consultation a Federal agency determines, 
with the concurrence of the Director, that

[[Page 891]]

its proposed action is not likely to adversely affect any listed species 
or critical habitat, the consultation is terminated.

Sec. 402.30  Definitions.

    The definitions in Sec. 402.02 are applicable to this subpart. In 
addition, the following definitions are applicable only to this subpart.
    Action Agency refers to the Department of Agriculture Forest Service 
(FS) or the Department of the Interior Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), 
Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), or 
National Park Service (NPS).
    Alternative Consultation Agreement (ACA) is the agreement described 
in Sec. 402.33 of this subpart.
    Fire Plan Project is an action determined by the Action Agency to be 
within the scope of the NFP as defined in this section.
    National Fire Plan (NFP) is the September 8, 2000, report to the 
President from the Departments of the Interior and Agriculture entitled 
``Managing the Impact of Wildfire on Communities and the Environment'' 
outlining a new approach to managing fires, together with the 
accompanying budget requests, strategies, plans, and direction, or any 
amendments thereto.
    Service Director refers to the FWS Director or the Assistant 
Administrator for Fisheries for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration.


<R05>
Sec. 402.31  Purpose.

    The purpose of these counterpart regulations is to enhance the 
efficiency and effectiveness of the consultation process under section 7 
of the ESA for Fire Plan Projects by providing an optional alternative 
to the procedures found in Sec. Sec. 402.13 and 402.14(b) of this part. 
These regulations permit an Action Agency to enter into an Alternative 
Consultation Agreement (ACA) with the Service, as described in Sec. 
402.33, which will allow the Action Agency to determine that a Fire Plan 
Project is ``not likely to adversely affect'' (NLAA) a listed species or 
designated critical habitat without formal

[[Page 892]]

or informal consultation with the Service or written concurrence from 
the Service. An NLAA determination for a Fire Plan Project made under an 
ACA, as described in Sec. 402.33, completes the Action Agency's 
statutory obligation to consult with the Service for that Project. In 
situations where the Action Agency does not make an NLAA determination 
under the ACA, the Action Agency would still be required to conduct 
formal consultation with the Service when required by Sec. 402.14. This 
process will be as protective to listed species and designated critical 
habitat as the process established in subpart B of this part. The 
standards and requirements for formal consultation under subpart B for 
Fire Plan Projects that do not receive an NLAA determination are 
unchanged.


<R05>
Sec. 402.32  Scope.

    (a) Section 402.33 establishes a process by which an Action Agency 
may determine that a proposed Fire Plan Project is not likely to 
adversely affect any listed species or designated critical habitat 
without conducting formal or informal consultation or obtaining written 
concurrence from the Service.
    (b) Section 402.34 establishes the Service's oversight 
responsibility and the standard for review under this subpart.
    (c) Nothing in this subpart C precludes an Action Agency at its 
discretion from initiating early, informal, or formal consultation as 
described in Sec. Sec. 402.11, 402.13, and 402.14, respectively.
    (d) The authority granted in this subpart is applicable to an Action 
Agency only where the Action Agency has entered into an ACA with the 
Service. An ACA entered into with one Service is valid with regard to 
listed species and designated critical habitat under the jurisdiction of 
that Service whether or not the Action Agency has entered into an ACA 
with the other Service.


<R05>
Sec. 402.33  Procedures.

    (a) The Action Agency may make an NLAA determination for a Fire Plan 
Project without informal consultation or written concurrence from the 
Director if the Action Agency has entered into and implemented an ACA. 
The Action Agency need not initiate formal consultation on a Fire Plan 
Project if the Action Agency has made an NLAA determination for the 
Project under this subpart. The Action Agency and the Service will use 
the following procedures in establishing an ACA.
    (1) Initiation: The Action Agency submits a written notification to 
the Service Director of its intent to enter into an ACA.
    (2) Development and Adoption of the Alternative Consultation 
Agreement: The Action Agency enters into an ACA with the Service 
Director. The ACA will, at a minimum, include the following components:
    (i) A list or description of the staff positions within the Action 
Agency that will have authority to make NLAA determinations under this 
subpart C.
    (ii) Procedures for developing and maintaining the skills necessary 
within the Action Agency to make NLAA determinations, including a 
jointly developed training program based on the needs of the Action 
Agency.
    (iii) A description of the standards the Action Agency will apply in 
assessing the effects of the action, including direct and indirect 
effects of the action and effects of any actions that are interrelated 
or interdependent with the proposed action.
    (iv) Provisions for incorporating new information and newly listed 
species or designated critical habitat into the Action Agency's effects 
analysis of proposed actions.
    (v) A mutually agreed upon program for monitoring and periodic 
program evaluation to occur at the end of the first year following 
signature of the ACA and periodically thereafter.
    (vi) Provisions for the Action Agency to maintain a list of Fire 
Plan Projects for which the Action Agency has made NLAA determinations. 
The Action Agency will also maintain the necessary records to allow the 
Service to complete the periodic program evaluations.
    (3) Training: Upon completion of the ACA, the Action Agency and the 
Service will implement the training program outlined in the ACA to the 
mutual satisfaction of the Action Agency and the Service.

[[Page 893]]

    (b) The Action Agency may, at its discretion, allow any subunit of 
the Action Agency to implement this subpart as soon as the subunit has 
fulfilled the training requirements of the ACA, upon written 
notification to the Service. The Action Agency shall at all times have 
responsibility for the adequacy of all NLAA determinations it makes 
under this subpart.
    (c) The ACA and any related oversight or monitoring reports shall be 
made available to the public through a notice of availability in the 
Federal Register.


<R05>
Sec. 402.34  Oversight.

    (a) Through the periodic program evaluation set forth in the ACA, 
the Service will determine whether the implementation of this subpart by 
the Action Agency is consistent with the best available scientific and 
commercial information, the ESA, and section 7 regulations.
    (b) The Service Director may use the results of the periodic program 
evaluation described in the ACA to recommend changes to the Action 
Agency's implementation of the ACA. If and as appropriate, the Service 
Director may suspend any subunit participating in the ACA or exclude any 
subunit from the ACA.
    (c) The Service Director retains discretion to terminate the ACA if 
the Action Agency fails to comply with the requirements of this subpart, 
section 7 of the ESA, or the terms of the ACA. Termination, suspension, 
or modification of an ACA does not affect the validity of any NLAA 
determinations made previously under the authority of this subpart.

Sec. 402.40  Definitions.

    The definitions in Sec. 402.02 are applicable to this subpart. In 
addition, the following definitions are applicable only to this subpart.
    (a) Alternative consultation agreement is the agreement described in 
Sec. 402.45.
    (b) Effects determination is a written determination by the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) addressing the effects of a FIFRA 
action on listed species or critical habitat. The contents of an effects 
determination will depend on the nature of the action. An effects 
determination submitted under Sec. 402.46 or Sec. 402.47 shall contain 
the information described in Sec. 402.14(c)(1)-(6) and a summary of the 
information on which the determination is based, detailing how the FIFRA 
action affects the listed species or critical habitat. EPA may consider 
the following additional sections for inclusion in an effects 
determination:
    (1) A conclusion whether or not the FIFRA action is likely to 
jeopardize the continued existence of any listed species or result in 
the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat and a 
description of any reasonable and prudent alternatives that may be 
available;
    (2) A description of the impact of any anticipated incidental taking 
of such listed species resulting from the FIFRA action, reasonable and 
prudent measures considered necessary or appropriate to minimize such 
impact, and terms and conditions necessary to implement such measures; 
and
    (3) A summary of any information or recommendations from an 
applicant. An effects determination shall be based on the best 
scientific and commercial data available.
    (c) FIFRA action is an action by EPA to approve, permit or authorize 
the sale, distribution or use of a pesticide under sections 136-136y of 
the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, 7 U.S.C. 136 et 
seq. (FIFRA). In any consultation under this subpart, EPA shall 
determine the nature and scope of a FIFRA action.
    (d) Listed species is a species listed as endangered or threatened 
under section 4 of the Act.
    (e) Partial biological opinion is the document provided under Sec. 
402.47(a), pending the conclusion of consultation under Sec. 402.47(b), 
stating the opinion of the Service as to whether or not a

[[Page 894]]

FIFRA action is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of one or 
more listed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification 
of one or more critical habitats, and describing the impact of any 
anticipated incidental taking of such listed species resulting from the 
FIFRA action, reasonable and prudent measures considered necessary or 
appropriate to minimize such impact, and terms and conditions necessary 
to implement such measures.
    (f) Service Director refers to the Director of the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service or the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries for the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
    (g) Service Representative is the person or persons designated to 
participate in advance coordination as provided in this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 402.41  Purpose.

    The purpose of these counterpart regulations is to enhance the 
efficiency and effectiveness of the existing consultation process under 
section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (Act), 16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq., 
by providing Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries 
Service (referred to jointly as ``Services'' and individually as 
``Service'') and EPA with additional means to satisfy the requirements 
of section 7(a)(2) of the Act for certain regulatory actions under 
FIFRA. These additional means will permit the Services and EPA to more 
effectively use the scientific and commercial data generated through the 
FIFRA regulatory process as part of the best scientific and commercial 
data available to protect listed species and critical habitat. The 
procedures authorized by these counterpart regulations will be as 
protective of listed species and critical habitat as the process 
established in subpart B of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 402.42  Scope and applicability.

    (a) Available consultation procedures. This subpart describes 
consultation procedures available to EPA to satisfy the obligations of 
section 7(a)(2) of the Act in addition to those in subpart B of this 
part for FIFRA actions authorized, funded, or carried out by EPA in 
which EPA has discretionary Federal involvement or control. EPA retains 
discretion to initiate early, informal, or formal consultation as 
described in Sec. Sec. 402.11, 402.13, and 402.14 for any FIFRA action. 
The procedures in this subpart may be employed for FIFRA actions as 
follows:
    (1) Interagency exchanges of information under Sec. 402.43 and 
advance coordination under Sec. 402.44 are available for any FIFRA 
action.
    (2) Alternative consultation under Sec. 402.45 is available for a 
listed species or critical habitat if EPA determines the FIFRA action is 
not likely to adversely affect the listed species or critical habitat.
    (3) Optional formal consultation under Sec. 402.46 is available for 
any FIFRA action with respect to any listed species or critical habitat.
    (4) The special procedures in Sec. 402.47 are available for 
consultations on FIFRA actions that will be unusually complex due to 
factors such as the geographic area or number of species that may be 
affected by the action.
    (5) EPA shall engage in consultation as to all listed species and 
critical habitat that may be affected by a FIFRA action, and may in its 
discretion employ more than one of the available consultation procedures 
for a FIFRA action that may affect more than one listed species or 
critical habitat.
    (6) EPA shall engage in consultation on actions involving requests 
for emergency exemptions under section 18 of FIFRA that may affect 
listed species or critical habitat, and may choose to do so under Sec. 
402.05 or other provisions of this subpart or subpart B of this part. 
Any required formal consultation shall be initiated as soon as 
practicable after the emergency is under control. For the purposes of 
Sec. 402.05(b) the definition of formal consultation in Sec. 402.02 
includes the procedures in Sec. 402.46.
    (7) EPA must prepare a biological assessment for a FIFRA action to 
the extent required by Sec. 402.12.
    (8) EPA must comply with Sec. 402.15 for all FIFRA actions.
    (9) After a consultation under this subpart has been concluded, EPA 
shall reinitiate consultation as required by Sec. 402.16 as soon as 
practicable after a circumstance requiring reinitiation occurs, and may 
employ the procedures

[[Page 895]]

in this subpart or subpart B of this part in any reinitiated 
consultation.
    (b) Exchanges of scientific information. As part of any of the 
additional consultation procedures provided in this subpart, EPA and the 
Services shall establish mutually-agreeable procedures for regular and 
timely exchanges of scientific information to achieve accurate and 
informed decision-making under this subpart and to ensure that the FIFRA 
process considers the best scientific and commercial data available on 
listed species and critical habitat in a manner consistent with the 
requirements of FIFRA and ESA.


<R05>
Sec. 402.43  Interagency exchanges of information.

    EPA may convey to the Service a written request for a list of any 
listed species or critical habitat that may be present in any area that 
may be affected by a FIFRA action. Within 30 days of receipt of such a 
request the Service shall advise EPA in writing whether, based on the 
best scientific and commercial data available, any listed species or 
critical habitat may be present in any such area. EPA may thereafter 
request the Service to provide available information (or references 
thereto) describing the applicable environmental baseline for each 
species or habitat that EPA determines may be affected by a FIFRA 
action, and the Service shall provide such information within 30 days of 
the request.


<R05>
Sec. 402.44  Advance coordination for FIFRA actions.

    (a) Advance coordination. EPA may request the Service to designate a 
Service Representative to work with EPA in the development of an effects 
determination for one or more listed species or critical habitat. EPA 
shall make such a request in writing and shall provide sufficient detail 
as to a FIFRA action planned for consultation to enable the Service to 
designate a representative with appropriate training and experience who 
shall normally be available to complete advance coordination with EPA 
within 60 days of the date of designation. Within 14 days of receiving 
such a request, the Service shall advise EPA of the designated Service 
Representative.
    (b) Participation of Service Representative in preparation of 
effects determination. The Service Representative designated under 
paragraph (a) of this section shall participate with EPA staff in the 
preparation of the effects determination identified under paragraph (a) 
of this section. EPA shall use its best efforts to include the 
designated Service Representative in all relevant discussions on the 
effects determination, to provide the designated Service Representative 
with access to all documentation used to prepare the effects 
determination, and to provide the designated Service Representative 
office and staff support sufficient to allow the Service Representative 
to participate meaningfully in the preparation of the effects 
determination. EPA shall consider all information timely identified by 
the designated Service Representative during the preparation of the 
effects determination.


<R05>
Sec. 402.45  Alternative consultation on FIFRA actions that are not
likely to adversely affect listed species or critical habitat.

    (a) Consultation obligations for FIFRA actions that are not likely 
to adversely affect listed species or critical habitat when alternative 
consultation agreement is in effect. If EPA and the Service have entered 
into an alternative consultation agreement as provided below, EPA may 
make a determination that a FIFRA action is not likely to adversely 
affect a listed species or critical habitat without informal 
consultation or written concurrence from the Director, and upon making 
such a determination for a listed species or critical habitat, EPA need 
not initiate any additional consultation on that FIFRA action as to that 
listed species or critical habitat. As part of any subsequent request 
for formal consultation on that FIFRA action under this subpart or 
subpart B of this part, EPA shall include a list of all listed species 
and critical habitat for which EPA has concluded consultation under this 
section.
    (b) Procedures for adopting and implementing an alternative 
consultation agreement. EPA and the Service may enter into an 
alternative consultation

[[Page 896]]

agreement using the following procedures:
    (1) Initiation. EPA submits a written notification to the Service 
Director of its intent to enter into an alternative consultation 
agreement.
    (2) Required contents of the alternative consultation agreement. The 
alternative consultation agreement will, at a minimum, include the 
following components:
    (i) Adequacy of EPA Determinations under the ESA. The alternative 
consultation agreement shall describe actions that EPA and the Service 
have taken to ensure that EPA's determinations regarding the effects of 
its actions on listed species or critical habitat are consistent with 
the ESA and applicable implementing regulations.
    (ii) Training. The alternative consultation agreement shall describe 
actions that EPA and the Service intend to take to ensure that EPA and 
Service personnel are adequately trained to carry out their respective 
roles under the alternative consultation agreement. The alternative 
consultation agreement shall provide that all effects determinations 
made by EPA under this subpart have been reviewed and concurred on by an 
EPA staff member who holds a current certification as having received 
appropriate training under the alternative consultation agreement.
    (iii) Incorporation of new information. The alternative consultation 
agreement shall describe processes that EPA and the Service intend to 
use to ensure that new information relevant to EPA's effects 
determinations is timely and appropriately considered.
    (iv) Incorporation of scientific advances. The alternative 
consultation agreement shall describe processes that EPA and the Service 
intend to use to ensure that the ecological risk assessment 
methodologies supporting EPA's effects determinations incorporate 
relevant scientific advances.
    (v) Oversight. The alternative consultation agreement shall describe 
the program and associated record keeping procedures that the Service 
and EPA intend to use to evaluate EPA's processes for making effects 
determinations consistent with these regulations and the alternative 
consultation agreement. The alternative consultation agreement shall 
provide that the Service's oversight will be based on periodic 
evaluation of EPA's program for making effects determinations under this 
subpart. Periodic program evaluation will occur at the end of the first 
year following signature of the alternative consultation agreement and 
should normally occur at least every five years thereafter.
    (vi) Records. The alternative consultation agreement shall include a 
provision for EPA to maintain a list of FIFRA actions for which EPA has 
made determinations under this section and to provide the list to the 
Services on request. EPA will also maintain the necessary records to 
allow the Service to complete program evaluations.
    (vii) Review of Alternative Consultation Agreement. The alternative 
consultation agreement shall include provisions for regular review and, 
as appropriate, modification of the agreement by EPA and the Service, 
and for departure from its terms in a particular case to the extent 
deemed necessary by both EPA and the Service.
    (3) Training. After EPA and the Service enter into the alternative 
consultation agreement, EPA and the Service will implement the training 
program outlined in the alternative consultation agreement to the mutual 
satisfaction of EPA and the Service.
    (4) Public availability. The alternative consultation agreement and 
any related oversight or monitoring reports shall be made available to 
the public to the extent provided by law.
    (c) Oversight of alternative consultation agreement implementation. 
Through the program evaluations set forth in the alternative 
consultation agreement, the Service will determine whether the 
implementation of this section by EPA is consistent with the best 
scientific and commercial information available, the ESA, and applicable 
implementing regulations. The Service Director may use the results of 
the program evaluations described in the alternative consultation 
agreement to recommend changes to EPA's implementation of

[[Page 897]]

the alternative consultation agreement. The Service Director retains 
discretion to terminate or suspend the alternative consultation 
agreement if, in using the procedures in this subpart, EPA fails to 
comply with the requirements of this subpart, section 7 of the ESA, or 
the terms of the alternative consultation agreement. Termination, 
suspension, or modification of an alternative consultation agreement 
does not affect the validity of any NLAA determinations made previously 
under the authority of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 402.46  Optional formal consultation procedure for FIFRA actions.

    (a) Initiation of consultation. EPA may initiate consultation on a 
FIFRA action under this section by delivering to the Service a written 
request for consultation. The written request shall be accompanied by an 
effects determination as defined in Sec. 402.40(b) and a list or 
summary of all references and data relied upon in the determination. All 
such references and data shall be made available to the Service on 
request and shall constitute part of the Service's administrative record 
for the consultation. The time for conclusion of the consultation under 
section 7(b)(1) of the Act is calculated from the date the Service 
receives the written request from EPA. Any subsequent interchanges 
regarding EPA's submission, including interchanges about the 
completeness of the effects determination, shall occur during 
consultation and do not extend the time for conclusion of the 
consultation unless EPA withdraws the request for consultation.
    (b) Additional information determination. For an effects 
determination prepared without advance coordination under Sec. 402.44, 
the Service may determine that additional available information would 
provide a better information base for the effects determination, in 
which case the Service Director shall notify the EPA Administrator 
within 45 days of the date the Service receives the effects 
determination. The notification shall describe such additional 
information in detail, and shall identify a means for obtaining that 
information within the time period available for consultation. EPA shall 
provide a copy of the Service Director's notification to any applicant. 
EPA may thereafter revise its effects determination, and may resubmit 
the revised effects determination to the Service. If EPA advises the 
Service it will not resubmit a revised effects determination to the 
Service, its initiation of consultation on the effects determination is 
deemed withdrawn.
    (c) Service responsibilities. (1) Within the later of 90 days of the 
date the Service receives EPA's written request for consultation or 45 
days of the date the Service receives an effects determination 
resubmitted under paragraph (b) of this section, and consistent with 
section 7(b)(1) of the Act, the Service shall take one of the following 
actions:
    (i) If the Service finds that the effects determination contains the 
information required by Sec. 402.40(b) and satisfies the requirements 
of section 7(b)(4) of the Act, and the Service concludes that the FIFRA 
action that is the subject of the consultation complies with section 
7(a)(2) of the Act, the Service will issue a written statement adopting 
the effects determination; or
    (ii) The Service will provide EPA a draft of a written statement 
modifying the effects determination, which shall meet the requirements 
of Sec. 402.14(i), and as modified adopting the effects determination, 
and shall provide a detailed explanation of the scientific and 
commercial data and rationale supporting any modification it makes; or
    (iii) The Service will provide EPA a draft of a biological opinion 
finding that the FIFRA action is likely to jeopardize the continued 
existence of a listed species or result in the destruction or adverse 
modification of critical habitat, and describing any reasonable and 
prudent alternatives if available.
    (2) If the Service acts under paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) or (c)(1)(iii) 
of this section, EPA shall, on request from an applicant, provide the 
applicant a copy of the draft written statement or draft biological 
opinion received from the Service. The Service shall at the request of 
EPA or an applicant discuss with EPA and the applicant the Service's 
review and evaluation under this section, and the basis for its 
findings. EPA and any applicant may submit written comments to the 
Service within 30 days after EPA receives the draft

[[Page 898]]

written statement or opinion from the Service unless the Service, EPA 
and any applicant agree to an extended deadline consistent with section 
7(b)(1) of the Act.
    (3) The Service will issue a final written statement or final 
biological opinion within 45 days after EPA receives the draft statement 
or opinion from the Service unless the deadline is extended under 
section 7(b)(1) of the Act.
    (d) Opinion of the Secretary. The written statement or opinion by 
the Service under paragraphs (c)(1) or (c)(3) of this section shall 
constitute the opinion of the Secretary and the incidental take 
statement, reasonable and prudent measures, and terms and conditions 
under section 7(b) of the Act.
    (e) Delegation of Authority for Service decisions. Any written 
statement modifying an effects determination or any biological opinion 
issued under this section shall be signed by the Service Director and 
such authority may not be delegated below the level of Assistant 
Director for Endangered Species (FWS) or Director of Office of Protected 
Resources (NOAA Fisheries).


<R05>
Sec. 402.47  Special consultation procedures for complex FIFRA actions.

    (a) Successive effects determinations. If EPA determines after 
conferring with the Service that consultation on a FIFRA action will be 
unusually complex due to factors such as the geographic area or number 
of species that may be affected by the action, EPA may address the 
effects of the action through successive effects determinations under 
this subpart addressing groupings or categories of species or habitats 
as established by EPA. EPA may initiate consultation based upon each 
such effects determination using the procedure in Sec. 402.46(a), and 
the provisions of Sec. 402.46(b) and (c) shall apply to any such 
consultation. When consultation is conducted under this section, the 
written statement or opinion provided by the Service under Sec. 
402.46(c) constitutes a partial biological opinion as to the species or 
habitats that are the subject of the consultation. While not 
constituting completion of consultation under section 7(a)(2), EPA 
retains authority to use such a partial biological opinion along with 
other available information in making a finding under section 7(d) of 
the Act.
    (b) Opinion of the Secretary. After conclusion of all consultation 
on the FIFRA action, the partial biological opinions issued under 
paragraph (a) of this section shall then collectively constitute the 
opinion of the Secretary and the incidental take statement, reasonable 
and prudent measures, and terms and conditions under section 7(b) of the 
Act except to the extent a partial biological opinion is modified by the

Sec. 403.01  Purpose and scope of regulations.

    The regulations contained in this part implement section 109 of the 
Act which, upon a finding by the Secretary

[[Page 899]]

of compliance with certain requirements, provides for the transfer of 
marine mammal management authority to the states.
    (a) The regulations of this part apply the procedures for the 
transfer of marine mammal management authority to a state, the form and 
minimum requirements of a state application for the transfer of 
management authority, the relationship between Federal and state 
wildlife agencies both prior and subsequent to the transfer of 
management authority, and the revocation and return of management 
authority to the Federal Government.
    (b) Nothing in this part shall prevent:
    (1) The taking of a marine mammal by or on behalf of a Federal, 
state or local government official, in accordance with Sec. 18.22 or 
Sec. 216.22 of this Title and section 109(h) of the Act, or (2) the 
adoption or enforcement of any state law or regulation relating to any 
marine mammal taken before December 21, 1972.
    (c) The information collection requirements contained in Sec. Sec. 
403.03, 403.06, and 403.07 of this part do not require approval by the 
Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq., because 
there are fewer than 10 respondents annually.


<R05>
Sec. 403.02  Definitions.

    The following definitions apply to this part:
    (a) The term species includes any population stock.
    (b) Optimum Sustainable Population or OSP means a population size 
which falls within a range from the population level of a given species 
or stock which is the largest supportable within the ecosystem to the 
population level that results in maximum net productivity. Maximum net 
productivity is the greatest net annual increment in population numbers 
or biomass resulting from additions to the population due to 
reproduction and/or growth less losses due to natural mortality.
    (c) State management program means existing and proposed state 
statutes, regulations, policies and other authorities which form the 
framework for the conservation of a species of marine mammals.
    (d) State regulation means the whole or part of a state agency 
statement of general or particular applicability and future effect 
designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy or 
describing the organization, procedure, or practice requirements of a 
state agency and which is duly promulgated in accordance with 
established procedure.
    (e) The Act means the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) of 1972, 
16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq., as amended by Pub. L. 97-58.
    (f) The Secretary means the Secretary of the Interior or the 
Secretary of Commerce, depending on the species involved. Under section 
3(11) of the Act, the Secretary of Commerce has jurisdiction over 
members of the order Cetacea and members, other than walruses, of the 
order Pinnipedia; the Secretary of the Interior has jurdisdiction over 
all other mammals. These secretarial authorities have been delegated to 
the National Marine Fisheries Service and the Fish and Wildlife Service, 
respectively.
    (g) The Service or Services means the Fish and Wildlife Service 
(FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), as appropriate 
depending on the species involved. Any determination or finding required 
by this part to be made by the ``Service'' must be made by the Director 
of the FWS or by the Assistant Administrator of the NMFS, or their 
delegees, as appropriate.


<R05>

    (d) In addition to the requirements contained in paragraphs (b) and 
(c) of this section, a request for the transfer of marine mammal 
management authority by the State of Alaska must contain the following 
concerning subsistence use of the species--
    (1) A statute and regulations concerning the take of marine mammals 
that ensure that
    (i) The taking of marine mammals species for subsistence uses will 
be the priority consumptive uses of the species;
    (ii) If restrictions on subsistence uses of the species are 
required, such restrictions shall be based upon the customary and direct 
dependence upon the species as the mainstay of livelihood, local 
residency, and the availability of alternative resources; and
    (iii) The taking of marine mammal species for subsistence uses is 
accomplished in a non-wasteful manner;
    (2) Statutes or regulations that ensure that the appropriate state 
agency will--
    (i) Authorize nonsubsistence consumptive uses of a marine mammal 
species only if such uses will have no significant adverse impact on 
subsistence uses of the species;
    (ii) Regulate nonsubsistence consumptive uses in a manner which, to 
the maximum extent practicable, provides economic opportunities, 
including, but not limited to, licensing of marine mammal hunting guides

regulation of nonsubsistence consumptive uses of marine mammals 
provides, to the maximum extent praticable, economic opportunities for 
the residents of rural coastal villages of Alaska who engage in 
subsistence uses of the species.
    (e) To assist states in preparing the state management program for 
submission, the Service will also, at the written request of any state, 
make a preliminary review of any aspects of the state management 
program. This review will be advisory in nature and shall not be binding 
upon the Services. Notwithstanding preliminary review by the Service, 
once any proposed aspect of the state management program has been 
prepared and submitted in final form, it shall be subject to final 
review and approval under paragraphs (f) through (h) of this section.
    (f)(1) After receiving the state's request, for management 
authority, the Service shall make an initial determination on whether 
the state's management program meets the requirements of the Act and 
these regulations.
    (2) Within 45 days after receiving the state's request, unless the 
state and the Service agree to another time period, the Service shall 
publish a general notice of its initial determination in the Federal 
Register together with, in the case of a positive determination, the 
text of a proposed rule to transfer management authority to the state. 
The general notice shall contain a summary of the major components of 
the state's management program and shall indicate where the full text of 
the management program may be inspected or copied. The public shall be 
allowed to submit written comments and to request an informal public 
hearing on the Service's initial determination and the state's 
management program within 60 days of publication of the general notice.

[[Page 902]]

    (g) If requested, the Service may conduct an informal public hearing

of such hearing in the Federal Register.
    (h) After considering all comments and other relevant information, 
the Service shall publish in the Federal Register its final 
determination on whether the state has developed and will implement a 
management program that meets the requirement of the Act and these 
regulations. In the case of a positive final determination, the Service 
shall publish with the notice a final regulation transferring management 
authority for the species to the state after the following requirements 
are satisfied:
    (1) The state's determinations pursuant to Sec. 403.04 of this part 
are final and implemented under state law;
    (2) Any cooperative allocation agreement required under Sec. 
403.05(a) of this part is implemented; and

Sec. 403.03(a) in proposed form in the state's management program.


<R05>
Sec. 403.04  Determinations and hearings under section 109(c) of the MMPA.

    (a) Introduction. In order to gain approval of its marine mammal 
management program the state must provide for a process, consistent with 
section 109(c) of the Act, to determine the optimum sustainable 
population of the species and the maximum number of animals that may be 
taken from populations it manages without reducing the species below 
OSP. The state process must be completed before the state may exercise 
any management authority over the subject marine mammals, and it must 
include the elements set forth below.
    (b) Basis, purpose, and scope. The process set forth in this section 
is applicable to and required for only the determination of the OSP of 
the species and maximum number that may be taken without reducing it 
below its OSP and, in the case of Alaska if the species is below OSP, 
the maximum number of animals that may be taken, if any, for subsistence 
uses without preventing the species from increasing toward its OSP. The 
state need not allow the maximum take, as determined in accordance with 
this process, that is biologically permissible. The state may change 
regulations establishing bag limits, quotas, seasons, areas, manner of 
take, etc. within the maximum biologically permissible take pursuant to 
its other rulemaking criteria, authority, and procedures. Compliance 
with the process set forth in this section would not be required again 
unless the state proposes to modify its determinations of the status of 
the species with respect to its OSP or the maximum permissible take from 
that species.
    (c) Initial determination by the State. The state agency with 
responsibility for managing the species in the event management 
authority is transferred to the state shall make initial determinations 
on the basis of the best scientific evidence available of:
    (1) Whether or not it is at its OSP; (2) if so, the maximum number 
of that species that nay be taken without reducing it below its OSP; and 
(3) if not, in the case of Alaska, the maximum number of animals that 
may be taken, if any, for subsistence uses without preventing the 
species from increasing toward its OSP.
    (d) Notice and review of initial determinations and request for 
hearing. The state agency shall provide notice of its initial 
determinations to the Service and the public and shall provide access to 
or copies of the documentation supporting its determinations to the 
Service and the public. The state agency shall indicate, in the notice 
of its initial determinations, the location(s) and hours during which 
such documentation may be inspected, and the costs, if any of copies of 
such documentation. The state agency shall also indicate in the notice 
that any interested person may request a hearing regarding the initial 
determinations, and the state shall provide a reasonable time, not less 
than 30 days, for making the request, taking into account the time 
required to advise the public of the initial determinations and to make 
the supporting documentation readily available to interested persons for 
their consideration. If a request for a

[[Page 903]]

hearing is not made within the prescribed time period, the initial 
determinations shall be treated as final.
    (e) Notice of hearing. If a request for a hearing is made within the 
prescribed time period by any interested person, the state agency shall 
provide notice of the hearing to the Service and the public not less 
than 30 days in advance of the scheduled date(s) of the hearing(s). The 
notice shall include the date(s), location(s), and purpose of the 
hearing, a recitation of the initial determinations, the name(s) of the 
person(s) who will preside at the hearing, and the manner and date by 
which interested persons must notify the state agency or presiding 
officer(s) of their desire to participate in the hearing. The state 
shall also make available and distribute upon request a list of 
witnesses and description of the documentation and other evidence that 
will be relied upon by the state's witnesses in support of its initial 
determinations sufficiently in advance of the hearing date so as to 
allow interested persons to prepare questions and supporting or rebuttal 
testimony for the hearing.
    (f) Conduct of the hearing. (1) The hearing shall be publicly 
conducted and reported verbatim by an official reporter.
    (2) The state shall sponsor all written documentation in support of 
its determinations with witnesses who are able, by virtue of training 
and experience, to respond fully to cross-examination regarding the 
facts and conclusions contained therein provided that, except by 
agreement of the parties, the state agency may not call any witnesses or 
introduce any documentation into the record unless the advance notice 
requirements of paragraph (e) of this section are met with respect to 
such witnesses or documentation.
    (3) Any interested person who has notificed the state agency of his 
desire to participate in the hearing pursuant to paragraph (e) of this 
section may participate in the hearing by presenting oral or written 
testimony or cross-examining the witnesses or other parties with respect 
to matters relevant to the state's initial determinations, provided that 
any such written documentation must be sponsored by a witness who is 
able, by virtue of training and experience, to respond fully to cross-
examination regarding the facts and conclusions contained therein.
    (4) The presiding officer(s) shall conduct the hearing in accordance 
with such other rules of evidence, criteria, and procedures as are 
necessary and appropriate for the expeditious and effective 
determination of the issues. The presiding officer(s) may provide for 
oral argument and/or written briefs at the end of the hearing.
    (5) Final determinations on the issues specified in paragraph (c) of 
this section must be supported by the best available scientific 
information so as to insure that any taking will be consistent with the 
maintenance of OSP.
    (g) Review of the hearing record and final determinations. (1) The 
state agency shall provide for either:
    (i) Review and evaluation of the hearing record by the presiding 
officer(s) and transmittal by the presiding officer(s) of recommended 
final determinations to the decision-maker(s) in the state agency; or
    (ii) Review and evaluation of the hearing record and final 
determinations by the state agency without benefit of any 
recommendations by the presiding officer(s). In any event, the final 
determinations by the state agency must be made solely on the basis of 
the record developed at the hearing. The state agency in making its 
final determinations, and/or presiding officer(s) in making his (their) 
recommended determinations, may not rely on oral or written evidence 
which was not presented at the hearing and made available to the parties 
for cross-examination and rebuttal testimony. Any such oral or written 
information transmitted to the presiding officer(s) or other members of 
the state agency responsible for the final determinations shall be 
treated as ex parte communications and may not be considered part of the 
record for decision.
    (2) The state agency shall make final determinations of the issues 
set forth in paragraph (c) of this section and shall include in its 
statement of final determinations a statement of findings and 
conclusions and the reasons or basis therefor.

[[Page 904]]

    (3) The state agency shall advise the Service and the public of its 
final determinations and shall provide access to or copies of its 
decision document and Hearing Record.
    (h) Judicial review. The state agency's final determinations after a 
hearing must be supported by substantial evidence in the record of the 
hearing. Opportunity for judicial review of the state agency's final 
determinations must be available under state law. The scope of judicial 
review shall be equivalent to that provided for in 5 U.S.C. 706(2) (A) 
through (E).


<R05>
Sec. 403.05  State and Federal responsibilities after transfer of
management authority.

    (a) After determinations required by section 403.04 of this part 
have been made in respect to a species whose range extends beyond the 
territorial waters of the state, the state shall not exercise management 
authority until a cooperative allocation agreement with the Secretary 
has been signed and the Service has transferred management authority 
pursuant to Sec. 403.03(h). The cooperative allocation agreement shall 
provide procedures for allocating, on a timely basis, the maximum amount 
of take as determined by the state pursuant to Sec. 403.04 of this 
part. Such allocation shall give first priority to incidental take 
within the zone described in section 3(14)(B) of the Act as provided for 
under section 101(a) of the Act, except that in the case of Alaska, 
first priority shall be given to subsistence use.
    (b) For those species to which paragraph (a) of this section 
applies, the state may request the Service to regulate the taking of the 
species within the zone described in section 3(14)(B) of the Act for 
subsistence uses and/or hunting in a manner consistent with the 
regulation by the state of such taking within the state. If such a 
request is made, the Service shall adopt and enforce within such zone, 
such of the state's regulatory provisions as the Service considers to be 
consistent with the administration within such zone of section 101(a) of 
the Act.
    (c) If management authority for a species has been transferred to a 
state pursuant to this subpart, the Service shall provide to the state 
an opportunity to review all requests for permits to remove live animals 
from habitat within the state for scientific research or public display 
purposes. If the state finds that issuance of the permit would not be 
consistent with its management program for the species:
    (1) The state shall so inform the Service, together with the reasons 
for such finding, within 30 days of its receipt of the application, and 
the Service shall not issue the permit; and
    (2) The Service shall provide to the permit applicant and the state 
an opportunity to adjust the permit application or otherwise reconcile 
it with the state management program for the species.
    (d) After management of a species has been transferred to the state, 
state and Federal authorities shall cooperate to the maximum extent 
practicable in conserving the species of marine mammals.


<R05>
Sec. 403.06  Monitoring and review of State management program.

    (a) The Service has responsibility to monitor and review 
implementation of all state management programs approved pursuant to 
this part.
    (b) In order to facilitate such review, each state to which 
management authority has been transferred shall submit an annual report, 
not later than 120 days after the close of such state's first full 
fiscal or calendar year following the effective date of the Service's 
approval of the State management program, and at the same time each 
following year, or at such other time as may be agreed upon. The repot 
shall contain the following information current for each reporting 
period:
    (1) Any changes in the state laws which comprise those aspects of 
the state management program submitted pursuant to Sec. 403.03(b), and, 
in the case of Alaska, Sec. 403.03(d), of this part;
    (2) Pertinent new data on the marine mammal species or the marine 
ecosystems in question including a summary of the status, trend and 
general health of the species;
    (3) A summary of available information relating to takings under the 
state management program;

[[Page 905]]

    (4) A summary of state actions to protect species' habitat;
    (5) A summary of all state research activity on the species;
    (6) Any significant changes in the information provided with the 
original request for transfer of management authority;
    (7) A summary of enforcement activity;
    (8) A summary of budget and staffing levels for the marine mammal 
activities in the categories of research, management and enforcement;
    (9) Any other information which the Service may request, consistent 
with the Act as amended, or which the state deems necessary or advisable 
to facilitate review by the Service of state management of the species.
    (c) Each state having an approved management program shall file a 
report, in a timely manner, not to exceed 45 days from the occurrence of 
any of the following:
    (1) Any change in a relevant state law (amendments, repealers, or 
new legislation or regulations or judicial precedent) as submitted 
pursuant to paragraphs (b)(2) through (b)(5), and in the case of Alaska, 
paragraph (d), of Sec. 403.03 of this part that may impair the State's 
ability to implement the program;
    (2) Any significant natural or manmade occurrence or any new 
scientific information that may warrant reconsideration of the 
determinations made pursuant to Sec. 403.04 of this part.
    (d) All components of the state request for transfer of management 
authority, as well as annual reports submitted under paragraph (b) of 
this section and any reports submitted under paragraph (c) of this 
section, shall be available for inspection and copying at the Office of 
the Chief, Division of Wildlife Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service, Department of the Interior, Washington, DC 20240, or, as 
appropriate, at the Office of Protected Species and Habitat 
Conservation, National Marine Fisheries Service, National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration, Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 
20235, and at the appropriate Service's regional office.


<R05>
Sec. 403.07  Revocation and return of State management authority.

    (a) Revocation of management. The Service shall have responsibility 
to review management of a species transferred to a state under this part 
and to determine whether or not the implementation of the state 
management program continues to comply with the requirements of the Act, 
this part and the state's approved management program.
    (1) Upon receipt of any substantial factual information suggesting 
that the state management program is not being implemented or is being 
implemented in a manner inconsistent with the Act, this part, or the 
state's approved management program, the Service shall, as soon as 
practicable but not later than 30 days after receipt, determine whether 
or not the state continues to comply with the requirements of the Act, 
this part and the state's approved management program.
    (2) Whenever pursuant to a review as specified in paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section, the Service determines that any substantial aspect of 
the state management program is not in compliance with the requirements 
of the Act, this part or the state's approved management program, it 
shall provide written notice to the state of its intent to revoke 
management authority, together with a statement, in detail, of those 
actions or failures to act upon which such intent to revoke is based. 
The Service shall publish notice of such intent to revoke in the Federal 
Register and invite public comment thereon, and shall conduct an 
informal public hearing on the matter if requested by the state or if 
the Service otherwise determines it to be necessary. The Service shall 
provide to the state an opportunity for consultation between the Service 
and the state concerning such actions or failures and necessary remedial 
actions to be taken by the state.
    (3) If within 90 days after notice is provided under paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section, the state has not taken such remedial measures 
as are necessary, in the judgment of the Service, to bring the state 
management program into compliance with the provision of the Act, this 
part and the state's approved

[[Page 906]]

management program, the Service shall revoke the transfer of management 
authority by written notice to the state and publication in the Federal 
Register.
    (b) Voluntary return of management authority to the Service. (1) If 
a state desires to return management of a species of marine mammals to 
the Service, it shall provide the Service notice of intent to return 
management. The Service shall accept the return of management, and such 
return shall become effective, upon publication of a notice in the 
Federal Register to this effect no sooner than 30 days (except in an 
emergency as determined by the Service) nor longer than 60 days after 
the state has provided notice of its intent to return management or 
unless otherwise agreed upon.
    (2) If implementation of any aspect of the state management program 
is enjoined by court order, the state shall advise the Service of such 
injunction and its effect on the state management program. If the state 
determines that the effect of the injunction is to preclude effective 
conservation and management of the species under the terms of the state 
management program, it shall so notify the Service and such notification 
shall be treated as a notice of intent to return management as provided 
in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. If the state determines that the 
injunction does not preclude effective conservation and management of 
marine mammals under the terms of the state management program, it shall 
so notify the Service together with the basis for the state's 
determination and such notice shall be treated as a report submitted 
pursuant to the terms of Sec. 403.06(c)(1) of this part. In either 
case, the state shall provide notice to the Service as soon as 
practicable but not more than 30 days after issuance of the injunction. 
Management authority returned to the Service pursuant to this paragraph 
may be re-transferred to the state, notwithstanding the requirements of 
Sec. 403.03, when, in the judgment of the Service, the cause for return 
of management authority to the Service has been alleviated in such a way 
as to allow effective conservation and management of the species 
consistent with the requirements of the Act and this part.
    (c) When revocation of a management authority pursuant to paragraph 
(a) of this section becomes final, or when a state returns management 
pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the Service shall resume such 
management authority and provide for the conservation of the species 
within the state in accordance with the provisions of the Act.

                Sec. Appendix B to Part 404--Approved VMS

                     I. VMS Mobile Transceiver Unit

                  Thrane & Thrane Sailor 3026D Gold VMS

    The Thrane & Thrane Sailor 3026D Gold VMS (TT-3026D) has been found 
to meet the minimum technical requirements for vessels issued permits to 
operate in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Marine National Monument. 
The address for the Thrane & Thrane distributor contact is provided in 
this notice under the heading VMS Provider Address.
    The TT-3026D Gold VMS features an integrated GPS/Inmarsat-C unit and 
a marine grade monitor with keyboard and integrated mouse. The unit is 
factory pre-configured for NMFS VMS operations (non-Global Maritime 
Distress & Safety System (non-GMDSS)). Satellite commissioning services 
are provided by Thrane & Thrane personnel.
    Automatic GPS position reporting starts after transceiver 
installation and power activation onboard the vessel. The unit is an 
integrated transceiver/antenna/GPS design using a floating 10 to 32 VDC 
power supply. The unit is configured for automatic reduced position 
transmissions when the vessel is stationary (i.e., in port). It allows 
for port stays without power drain or power shut down. The unit restarts 
normal position transmission automatically when the vessel goes to sea.
    The TT-3026D provides operation down to <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>15 
degree angles. The unit has the capability of two-way communications to 
send formatted forms and to receive e-mail and other messages. A 
configuration option is available to automatically send position reports 
to a private address, such as a fleet management company.
    A vessel owner may purchase this system by contacting the entity 
identified in this notice under the heading ``VMS Provider Address'' The 
owner should identify himself or herself as a vessel owner issued a 
permit to operate in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Marine National 
Monument, so the transceiver set can be properly configured. To use the 
TT-3026D the vessel owner will need to establish an Inmarsat-C system 
use contract with an approved Inmarsat-C communications service 
provider. The owner will be required to complete the Inmarsat-C 
``Registration for Service Activation for Maritime Mobile Earth 
Station.'' The owner should consult with Thrane & Thrane when completing 
this form.
    Thrane & Thrane personnel will perform the following services before 
shipment: (1) Configure the transceiver according to OLE specifications 
for vessels issued permits to operate in the Northwestern Hawaiian 
Islands Marine National Monument; (2) download the predetermined NMFS 
position reporting and broadcast command identification numbers into the 
unit; (3) test the unit to ensure operation when installation has been 
completed on the vessel; and (4) forward the Inmarsat service provider 
and the transceiver identifying information to OLE.

                 II. Inmarsat-C Communications Providers

    It is recommended, for vendor warranty and customer service 
purposes, that the vessel owner keep for his or her records and that 
Telenor and Xantic have on record the following identifying information: 
(1) Signed and dated receipts and contracts; (2) transceiver serial 
number; (3) Telenor or Xantic customer number, user name and password; 
(4) e-mail address of transceiver; (5) Inmarsat identification number; 
(6) owner name; (7) vessel name; (8) vessel documentation or 
registration number; and (9) mobile earth station license (FCC license).
    The OLE will provide an installation and activation checklist that 
the vessel owner must follow. The vessel owner must sign a statement on 
the checklist certifying compliance with the installation procedures and 
return the checklist to OLE. Installation can be performed by an 
experienced crew or by an electronics specialist, and the installation 
cost is paid by the owner.
    The owner may confirm the TT-3026D operation and communications 
service to ensure that position reports are automatically sent to and 
received by OLE before leaving on a trip under VMS. The OLE does not 
regard the vessel as meeting requirements until position reports are 
automatically received. For confirmation purposes, contact the NOAA 
Fisheries Office for Law Enforcement, 8484 Georgia Ave., Suite 415, 
Silver Spring, MD 20910, phone 888-219-9228, fax 301-427-0049.

                       Telenor Satellite Services

    Inmarsat-C is a store-and-forward data messaging service. Inmarsat-C 
allows users to send and receive information virtually anywhere in the 
world, on land, at sea, and in the air. Inmarsat-C supports a wide 
variety of applications including Internet, e-mail, position and weather 
reporting, a free daily news service, and remote equipment monitoring 
and control. Mariners can use Inmarsat-C free of charge to send critical

    Xantic is a provider of Vessel Monitoring Services to the maritime 
industry. By installing an approved OLE Inmarsat-C transceiver on the 
vessel, vessels can send and receive e-mail, to and from land, while the 
transceiver automatically sends vessel position reports to OLE, and is 
fully compliant with the International Coast Guard Search and Rescue 
Centers. Xantic Vessel Monitoring System Services are being sold through 
Thrane & Thrane, Inc. For the Thrane & Thrane and Xantic addresses, look 
in this notice under the heading ``VMS Provider Address''
    For Telenor and Xantic, Thrane & Thrane customer service supports 
the security and privacy of vessel accounts and messages with the 
following: (a) Password authentication for vessel owners or agents and 
for OLE to prevent unauthorized changes or inquiries; and (b) separation 
of private messages from OLE messages. (OLE requires VMS-related 
position reports, only.)
    Billing is separated between accounts for the vessel owner and the 
OLE. VMS position reports and vessel-initiated messaging are paid for by 
the vessel owner. Messaging initiated from OLE operations center is paid 
for by NOAA.
    Thrane & Thrane provides customer service for Telenor and Xantic 
users to support and establish two-way transmission of transceiver unit 
configuration commands between the transceiver and land-based control 
centers. This supports OLE's message needs and, optionally, the crew's 
private message needs.
    The vessel owner can configure automatic position reports to be sent 
to a private address, such as to a fleet management company.
    Vessel owners wishing to use Telenor or Xantic services will need to 
purchase an Inmarsat-C transceiver approved for vessels issued permits 
to operate in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Marine National 
Monument. The owner will need to complete an Inmarsat-C system use 
contract with Telenor or Xantic, including a mobile earth station 
license (FCC requirement). The transceiver will need to be commissioned 
with Inmarsat according to Telenor or Xantic's instructions. The owner 
should refer to and follow the configuration, installation, and service 
activation procedures for the specific transceiver purchased.

                      Subpart A_General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 424.01  Scope and purpose.

    (a) Part 424 provides rules for revising the Lists of Endangered and 
Threatened Wildlife and Plants and, where appropriate, designating or 
revising their critical habitats. Criteria are provided for determining 
species to be endangered or threatened and for designating critical 
habitats. Procedures for receiving and considering petitions to revise 
the lists and for conducting periodic reviews of listed species also are 
established.
    (b) The purpose of these rules is to interpret and implement those 
portions of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 
1531 et seq.), that pertain to the listing of species and the 
determination of critical habitats.


<R05>
Sec. 424.02  Definitions.

    (a) The definitions of terms in 50 CFR 402.02 shall apply to this 
part 424, except as otherwise stated.

[[Page 918]]

    (b) Candidate means any species being considered by the Secretary 
for listing as an endangered or a threatened species, but not yet the 
subject of a proposed rule.
    (c) Conservation, conserve, and conserving mean to use and the use 
of all methods and procedures that are necessary to bring any endangered 
or threatened species to the point at which the measures provided 
pursuant to the Act are no longer necessary. Such methods and procedures 
include, but are not limited to, all activities associated with 
scientific resources management such as research, census, law 
enforcement, habitat acquisition and maintenance, propagation, live 
trapping, and transplantation, and, in the extraordinary case where 
population pressures within a given ecosystem cannot be otherwise 
relieved, may include regulated taking.
    (d) Critical habitat means (1) the specific areas within the 
geographical area currently occupied by a species, at the time it is 
listed in accordance with the Act, on which are found those physical or 
biological features (i) essential to the conservation of the species and 
(ii) that may require special management considerations or protection, 
and (2) specific areas outside the geographical area occupied by a 
species at the time it is listed upon a determination by the Secretary 
that such areas are essential for the conservation of the species.
    (e) Endangered species means a species that is in danger of 
extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range.
    (f) List or lists means the Lists of Endangered and Threatened 
Wildlife and Plants found at 50 CFR 17.11(h) or 17.12(h).
    (g) Plant means any member of the plant kingdom, including, without 
limitation, seeds, roots, and other parts thereof.
    (h) Public hearing means an informal hearing to provide the public 
with the opportunity to give comments and to permit an exchange of 
information and opinion on a proposed rule.
    (i) Secretary means the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary 
of Commerce, as appropriate, or their authorized representatives.
    (j) Special management considerations or protection means any 
methods or procedures useful in protecting physical and biological 
features of the environment for the conservation of listed species.
    (k) Species includes any species or subspecies of fish, wildlife, or 
plant, and any distinct population segment of any vertebrate species 
that interbreeds when mature. Excluded is any species of the Class 
Insecta determined by the Secretary to constitute a pest whose 
protection under the provisions of the Act would present an overwhelming 
and overriding risk to man.
    (l) State agency means any State agency, department, board, 
commission, or other governmental entity that is responsible for the 
management and conservation of fish, plant, or wildlife resources within 
a State.
    (m) Threatened species means any species that is likely to become an 
endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout all or a 
significant portion of its range.
    (n) Wildlife or fish and wildlife means any member of the animal 
kingdom, including without limitation, any vertebrate, mollusk, 
crustacean, arthropod, or other invertebrate, and includes any part, 
product, egg, or offspring thereof, or the dead body or parts thereof.


<R04>
                     Subpart B_Revision of the Lists


<R05>
Sec. 424.10  General.

    The Secretary may add a species to the lists or designate critical 
habitat, delete a species or critical habitat, change the listed status 
of a species, revise the boundary of an area designated as critical 
habitat, or adopt or modify special rules (see 50 CFR 17.40-17.48 and 
parts 222 and 227) applied to a threatened species only in accordance 
with the procedures of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 424.11  Factors for listing, delisting, or reclassifying species.

    (a) Any species or taxonomic group of species (e.g., genus, 
subgenus) as defined in Sec. 424.02(k) is eligible for listing under 
the Act. A taxon of higher rank than species may be listed only if all 
included species are individually found

[[Page 919]]

to be endangered or threatened. In determining whether a particular 
taxon or population is a species for the purposes of the Act, the 
Secretary shall rely on standard taxonomic distinctions and the 
biological expertise of the Department and the scientific community 
concerning the relevant taxonomic group.
    (b) The Secretary shall make any determination required by 
paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section solely on the basis of the best 
available scientific and commercial information regarding a species' 
status, without reference to possible economic or other impacts of such 
determination.
    (c) A species shall be listed or reclassified if the Secretary 
determines, on the basis of the best scientific and commercial data 
available after conducting a review of the species' status, that the 
species is endangered or threatened because of any one or a combination 
of the following factors:
    (1) The present or threatened destruction, modification, or 
curtailment of its habitat or range;
    (2) Over utilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or 
educational purposes;
    (3) Disease or predation;
    (4) The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms; or
    (5) Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued 
existence.
    (d) The factors considered in delisting a species are those in 
paragraph (c) of this section as they relate to the definitions of 
endangered or threatened species. Such removal must be supported by the 
best scientific and commercial data available to the Secretary after 
conducting a review of the status of the species. A species may be 
delisted only if such data substantiate that it is neither endangered 
nor threatened for one or more of the following reasons:
    (1) Extinction. Unless all individuals of the listed species had 
been previously identified and located, and were later found to be 
extirpated from their previous range, a sufficient period of time must 
be allowed before delisting to indicate clearly that the species is 
extinct.
    (2) Recovery. The principal goal of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service is to return listed 
species to a point at which protection under the Act is no longer 
required. A species may be delisted on the basis of recovery only if the 
best scientific and commercial data available indicate that it is no 
longer endangered or threatened.
    (3) Original data for classification in error. Subsequent 
investigations may show that the best scientific or commercial data 
available when the species was listed, or the interpretation of such 
data, were in error.
    (e) The fact that a species of fish, wildlife, or plant is protected 
by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild 
Fauna and Flora (see part 23 of this title 50) or a similar 
international agreement on such species, or has been identified as 
requiring protection from unrestricted commerce by any foreign nation, 
or to be in danger of extinction or likely to become so within the 
foreseeable future by any State agency or by any agency of a foreign 
nation that is responsible for the conservation of fish, wildlife, or 
plants, may constitute evidence that the species is endangered or 
threatened. The weight given such evidence will vary depending on the 
international agreement in question, the criteria pursuant to which the 
species is eligible for protection under such authorities, and the 
degree of protection afforded the species. The Secretary shall give 
consideration to any species protected under such an international 
agreement, or by any State or foreign nation, to determine whether the 
species is endangered or threatened.
    (f) The Secretary shall take into account, in making determinations 
under paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, those efforts, if any, being 
made by any State or foreign nation, or any political subdivision of a 
State or foreign nation, to protect such species, whether by predator 
control, protection of habitat and food supply, or other conservation 
practices, within any area under its jurisdiction, or on the high seas.


<R05>
Sec. 424.12  Criteria for designating critical habitat.

    (a) Critical habitat shall be specified to the maximum extent 
prudent and

[[Page 920]]

determinable at the time a species is proposed for listing. If 
designation of critical habitat is not prudent or if critical habitat is 
not determinable, the reasons for not designating critical habitat will 
be stated in the publication of proposed and final rules listing a 
species. A final designation of critical habitat shall be made on the 
basis of the best scientific data available, after taking into 
consideration the probable economic and other impacts of making such a 
designation in accordance with Sec. 424.19.
    (1) A designation of critical habitat is not prudent when one or 
both of the following situations exist:
    (i) The species is threatened by taking or other human activity, and 
identification of critical habitat can be expected to increase the 
degree of such threat to the species, or
    (ii) Such designation of critical habitat would not be beneficial to 
the species.
    (2) Critical habitat is not determinable when one or both of the 
following situations exist:
    (i) Information sufficient to perform required analyses of the 
impacts of the designation is lacking, or
    (ii) The biological needs of the species are not sufficiently well 
known to permit identification of an area as critical habitat.
    (b) In determining what areas are critical habitat, the Secretary 
shall consider those physical and biological features that are essential 
to the conservation of a given species and that may require special 
management considerations or protection. Such requirements include, but 
are not limited to the following:
    (1) Space for individual and population growth, and for normal 
behavior;
    (2) Food, water, air, light, minerals, or other nutritional or 
physiological requirements;
    (3) Cover or shelter;
    (4) Sites for breeding, reproduction, rearing of offspring, 
germination, or seed dispersal; and generally;
    (5) Habitats that are protected from disturbance or are 
representative of the historic geographical and ecological distributions 
of a species.

When considering the designation of critical habitat, the Secretary 
shall focus on the principal biological or physical constituent elements 
within the defined area that are essential to the conservation of the 
species. Known primary constituent elements shall be listed with the 
critical habitat description. Primary constituent elements may include, 
but are not limited to, the following: roost sites, nesting grounds, 
spawning sites, feeding sites, seasonal wetland or dryland, water 
quality or quantity, host species or plant pollinator, geological 
formation, vegetation type, tide, and specific soil types.
    (c) Each critical habitat will be defined by specific limits using 
reference points and lines as found on standard topographic maps of the 
area. Each area will be referenced to the State(s), county(ies), or 
other local governmental units within which all or part of the critical 
habitat is located. Unless otherwise indicated within the critical 
habitat descriptions, the names of the State(s) and county(ies) are 
provided for information only and do not constitute the boundaries of 
the area. Ephemeral reference points (e.g., trees, sand bars) shall not 
be used in defining critical habitat.
    (d) When several habitats, each satisfying the requirements for 
designation as critical habitat, are located in proximity to one 
another, an inclusive area may be designated as critical habitat.

    Example: Several dozen or more small ponds, lakes, and springs are 
found in a small local area. The entire area could be designated 
critical habitat if it were concluded that the upland areas were 
essential to the conservation of an aquatic species located in the ponds 
and lakes.

    (e) The Secretary shall designate as critical habitat areas outside 
the geographical area presently occupied by a species only when a 
designation limited to its present range would be inadequate to ensure 
the conservation of the species.
    (f) Critical habitat may be designated for those species listed as 
threatened or endangered but for which no critical habitat has been 
previously designated.
    (g) Existing critical habitat may be revised according to procedures 
in this

[[Page 921]]

section as new data become available to the Secretary.
    (h) Critical habitat shall not be designated within foreign 
countries or in other areas outside of United States jurisdiction.


<R05>
Sec. 424.13  Sources of information and relevant data.

    When considering any revision of the lists, the Secretary shall 
consult as appropriate with affected States, interested persons and 
organizations, other affected Federal agencies, and, in cooperation with 
the Secretary of State, with the country or countries in which the 
species concerned are normally found or whose citizens harvest such 
species from the high seas. Data reviewed by the Secretary may include, 
but are not limited to scientific or commercial publications, 
administrative reports, maps or other graphic materials, information 
received from experts on the subject, and comments from interested 
parties.


<R05>
Sec. 424.14  Petitions.

    (a) General. Any interested person may submit a written petition to 
the Secretary requesting that one of the actions described in Sec. 
424.10 be taken. Such a document must clearly identify itself as a 
petition and be dated. It must contain the name, signature, address, 
telephone number, if any, and the association, institution, or business 
affiliation, if any, of the petitioner. The Secretary shall acknowledge 
in writing receipt of such a petition within 30 days.
    (b) Petitions to list, delist, or reclassify species. (1) To the 
maximum extent practicable, within 90 days of receiving a petition to 
list, delist, or reclassify a species, the Secretary shall make a 
finding as to whether the petition presents substantial scientific or 
commercial information indicating that the petitioned action may be 
warranted. For the purposes of this section, ``substantial information'' 
is that amount of information that would lead a reasonable person to 
believe that the measure proposed in the petition may be warranted. The 
Secretary shall promptly publish such finding in the Federal Register 
and so notify the petitioner.
    (2) In making a finding under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the 
Secretary shall consider whether such petition--
    (i) Clearly indicates the administrative measure recommended and 
gives the scientific and any common name of the species involved;
    (ii) Contains detailed narrative justification for the recommended 
measure, describing, based on available information, past and present 
numbers and distribution of the species involved and any threats faced 
by the species;
    (iii) Provides information regarding the status of the species over 
all or a significant portion of its range; and
    (iv) Is accompanied by appropriate supporting documentation in the 
form of bibliographic references, reprints of pertinent publications, 
copies of reports or letters from authorities, and maps.

The petitioner may provide information that describes any recommended 
critical habitat as to boundaries and physical features, and indicates 
any benefits and/or adverse effects on the species that would result 
from such designation. Such information, however, will not be a basis 
for the determination of the substantiality of a petition.
    (3) Upon making a positive finding under paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section, the Secretary shall commence a review of the status of the 
species concerned and shall make, within 12 months of receipt of such 
petition, one of the following findings:
    (i) The petitioned action is not warranted, in which case the 
Secretary shall promptly publish such finding in the Federal Register 
and so notify the petitioner.
    (ii) The petitioned action is warranted, in which case the Secretary 
shall promptly publish in the Federal Register a proposed regulation to 
implement the action pursuant to Sec. 424.16 of this part, or
    (iii) The petitioned action is warranted, but that--
    (A) The immediate proposal and timely promulgation of a regulation 
to implement the petitioned action is precluded because of other pending 
proposals to list, delist, or reclassify species, and

[[Page 922]]

    (B) Expeditious progress is being made to list, delist, or 
reclassify qualified species,

in which case, such finding shall be promptly published in the Federal 
Register together with a description and evaluation of the reasons and 
data on which the finding is based.
    (4) If a finding is made under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section 
with regard to any petition, the Secretary shall, within 12 months of 
such finding, again make one of the findings described in paragraph 
(b)(3) with regard to such petition, but no further finding of 
substantial information will be required.
    (c) Petitions to revise critical habitat. (1) To the maximum extent 
practicable, within 90 days of receiving a petition to revise a critical 
habitat designation, the Secretary shall make a finding as to whether 
the petition presents substantial scienific information indicating that 
the revision may be warranted. The Secretary shall promptly publish such 
finding in the Federal Register and so notify the petitioner.
    (2) In making the finding required by paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section, the Secretary shall consider whether a petition contains--
    (i) Information indicating that areas petitioned to be added to 
critical habitat contain physical and biological features essential to, 
and that may require special management to provide for, the conservation 
of the species involved; or
    (ii) Information indicating that areas designated as critical 
habitat do not contain resources essential to, or do not require special 
management to provide for, the conservation of the species involved.
    (3) Within 12 months after receiving a petition found under 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section to present substantial information 
indicating that revision of a critical habitat may be warranted, the 
Secretary shall determine how he intends to proceed with the requested 
revision, and shall promptly publish notice of such intention in the 
Federal Register.
    (d) Petitions to designate critical habitat or adopt special rules. 
Upon receiving a petition to designate critical habitat or to adopt a 
special rule to provide for the conservation of a species, the Secretary 
shall promptly conduct a review in accordance with the Administrative 
Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) and applicable Departmental regulations, 
and take appropriate action.


<R05>
Sec. 424.15  Notices of review.

    (a) If the Secretary finds that one of the actions described in 
Sec. 424.10 may be warranted, but that the available evidence is not 
sufficiently definitive to justify proposing the action at that time, a 
notice of review may be published in the Federal Register. The notice 
will describe the measure under consideration, briefly explain the 
reasons for considering the action, and solicit comments and additional 
information on the action under consideration.
    (b) The Secretary from time to time also may publish notices of 
review containing the names of species that are considered to be 
candidates for listing under the Act and indicating whether sufficient 
scientific or commercial information is then available to warrant 
proposing to list such species, the names of species no longer being 
considered for listing, or the names of listed species being considered 
for delisting or reclassification. However, none of the substantive or 
procedural provisions of the Act apply to a species that is designated 
as a candidate for listing.
    (c) Such notices of review will invite comment from all interested 
parties regarding the status of the species named. At the time of 
publication of such a notice, notification in writing will be sent to 
State agencies in any affected States, known affected Federal agencies, 
and, to the greatest extent practicable, through the Secretary of State, 
to the governments of any foreign countries in which the subject species 
normally occur.


<R05>
Sec. 424.16  Proposed rules.

    (a) General. Based on the information received through Sec. Sec. 
424.13, 424.14, 424.15, and 424.21, or through other available avenues, 
the Secretary may propose revising the lists as described in Sec. 
424.10.
    (b) Contents. A notice of a proposed rule to carry out one of the 
actions described in Sec. 424.10 shall contain the

[[Page 923]]

complete text of the proposed rule, a summary of the data on which the 
proposal is based (including, as appropriate, citation of pertinent 
information sources), and shall show the relationship of such data to 
the rule proposed. If such a rule designates or revises critical 
habitat, such summary shall, to the maximum extent practicable, include 
a brief description and evaluation of those activities (whether public 
or private) that, in the opinion of the Secretary, if undertaken, may 
adversely modify such habitat, or may be affected by such designation. 
Any proposed rule to designate or revise critical habitat shall contain 
a map of such habitat. Any such notice proposing the listing, delisting, 
or reclassification of a species or the designation or revision of 
critical habitat shall also include a summary of factors affecting the 
species and/or critical habitat.
    (c) Procedures--(1) Notifications. In the case of any proposed rule 
to list, delist, or reclassify a species, or to designate or revise 
critical habitat, the Secretary shall--
    (i) Publish notice of the proposal in the Federal Register;
    (ii) Give actual notice of the proposed regulation (including the 
complete text of the regulation) to the State agency in each State in 
which the species is believed to occur, and to each county or equivalent 
jurisdiction therein in which the species is believed to occur, and 
invite the comment of each such agency and jurisdiction;
    (iii) Give notice of the proposed regulation to any Federal 
agencies, local authorities, or private individuals or organizations 
known to be affected by the rule;
    (iv) Insofar as practical, and in cooperation with the Secretary of 
State, give notice of the proposed regulation to list, delist, or 
reclassify a species to each foreign nation in which the species is 
believed to occur or whose citizens harvest the species on the high 
seas, and invite the comment of such nation;
    (v) Give notice of the proposed regulation to such professional 
scientific organizations as the Secretary deems appropriate; and
    (vi) Publish a summary of the proposed regulation in a newspaper of 
general circulation in each area of the United States in which the 
species is believed to occur.
    (2) Period of public comments. At least 60 days shall be allowed for 
public comment following publication in the Federal Register of a rule 
proposing the listing, delisting, or reclassification of a species, or 
the designation or revision of critical habitat. All other proposed 
rules shall be subject to a comment period of at least 30 days following 
publication in the Federal Register. The Secretary may extend or reopen 
the period for public comment on a proposed rule upon a finding that 
there is good cause to do so. A notice of any such extension or 
reopening shall be published in the Federal Register, and shall specify 
the basis for so doing.
    (3) Public hearings. The Secretary shall promptly hold at least one 
public hearing if any person so requests within 45 days of publication 
of a proposed regulation to list, delist, or reclassify a species, or to 
designate or revise critical habitat. Notice of the location and time of 
any such hearing shall be published in the Federal Register not less 
than 15 days before the hearing is held.


<R05>
Sec. 424.17  Time limits and required actions.

    (a) General. (1) Within 1 year of the publication of a rule 
proposing to determine whether a species is an endangered or threatened 
species, or to designate or revise critical habitat, the Secretary shall 
publish one of the following in the Federal Register:
    (i) A final rule to implement such determination or revision,
    (ii) A finding that such revision should not be made,
    (iii) A notice withdrawing the proposed rule upon a finding that 
available evidence does not justify the action proposed by the rule, or
    (iv) A notice extending such 1-year period by an additional period 
of not more than 6 months because there is substantial disagreement 
among scientists knowledgeable about the species concerned regarding the 
sufficiency or accuracy of the available

[[Page 924]]

data relevant to the determination or revision concerned.
    (2) If an extension is made under paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this 
section, the Secretary shall, within the extended period, take one of 
the actions described in paragraphs (a)(1) (i), (ii), or (iii) of this 
section.
    (3) If a proposed rule is withdrawn under paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of 
this section, the notice of withdrawal shall set forth the basis upon 
which the proposed rule has been found not to be supported by available 
evidence. The Secretary shall not again propose a rule withdrawn under 
such provision except on the basis of sufficient new information that 
warrants a reproposal.
    (b) Critical habitat designations. A final rule designating critical 
habitat of an endangered or a threatened species shall to the extent 
permissible under Sec. 424.12 be published concurrently with the final 
rule listing such species, unless the Secretary deems that--
    (1) It is essential to the conservation of such species that it be 
listed promptly; or
    (2) Critical habitat of such species is not then determinable,

in which case, the Secretary, with respect to the proposed regulation to 
designate such habitat, may extend the 1-year period specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section by not more than one additional year. Not 
later than the close of such additional year the Secretary must publish 
a final regulation, based on such data as may be available at that time, 
designating, to the maximum extent prudent, such habitat.


<R05>
Sec. 424.18  Final rules--general.

    (a) Contents. A final rule promulgated to carry out the purposes of 
the Act will be published in the Federal Register. This publication will 
contain the complete text of the rule, a summary of the comments and 
recommendations received in response to the proposal (including 
applicable public hearings), summaries of the data on which the rule is 
based and the relationship of such data to the final rule, and a 
description of any conservation measures available under the rule. 
Publication of a final rule to list, delist, or reclassify a species or 
designate or revise critical habitat shall also provide a summary of 
factors affecting the species. A rule designating or revising critical 
habitat will also contain a description of the boundaries and a map of 
such habitat and will, to the maximum extent practicable, be accompanied 
by a brief description and evaluation of those activities (whether 
public or private) that might occur in the area and which, in the 
opinion of the Secretary, may adversly modify such habitat or be 
affected by such designation.
    (b) Effective date. A final rule shall take effect--
    (1) Not less than 30 days after it is published in the Federal 
Register, except as otherwise provided for good cause found and 
published with the rule; and
    (2) Not less than 90 days after (i) publication in the Federal 
Register of the proposed rule, and (ii) actual notification of any 
affected State agencies and counties or equivalent jurisdictions in 
accordance with Sec. 424.16(c)(1)(ii).
    (c) Disagreement with State agency. If a State agency, given notice 
of a proposed rule in accordance with Sec. 424.16(c)(1)(ii), submits 
comments disagreeing in whole or in part with a proposed rule, and the 
Secretary issues a final rule that is in conflict with such comments, or 
if the Secretary fails to adopt a regulation for which a State agency 
has made a petition in accordance with Sec. 424.14, the Secretary shall 
provide such agency with a written justification for the failure to 
adopt a rule consistent with the agency's comments or petition.


<R05>
Sec. 424.19  Final rules--impact analysis of critical habitat.

    The Secretary shall identify any significant activities that would 
either affect an area considered for designation as critical habitat or 
be likely to be affected by the designation, and shall, after proposing 
designation of such an area, consider the probable economic and other 
impacts of the designation upon proposed or ongoing activities. The 
Secretary may exclude any portion of such an area from the critical 
habitat if the benefits of such exclusion outweigh the benefits of 
specifying the area as part of the critical habitat. The Secretary shall 
not exclude any such

[[Page 925]]

area if, based on the best scientific and commercial data available, he 
determines that the failure to designate that area as critical habitat 
will result in the extinction of the species concerned.


<R05>
Sec. 424.20  Emergency rules.

    (a) Sections 424.16, 424.17, 424.18, and 424.19 notwithstanding, the 
Secretary may at any time issue a regulation implementing any action 
described in Sec. 424.10 in regard to any emergency posing a 
significant risk to the well-being of a species of fish, wildlife, or 
plant. Such rules shall, at the discretion of the Secretary, take effect 
immediately on publication in the Federal Register. In the case of any 
such action that applies to a resident species, the Secretary shall give 
actual notice of such regulation to the State agency in each State in 
which such species is believed to occur. Publication in the Federal 
Register of such an emergency rule shall provide detailed reasons why 
the rule is necessary. An emergency rule shall cease to have force and 
effect after 240 days unless the procedures described in Sec. Sec. 
424.16, 424.17, 424.18, and 424.19 (as appropriate) have been complied 
with during that period.
    (b) If at any time after issuing an emergency rule, the Secretary 
determines, on the basis of the best scientific and commercial data 
available, that substantial evidence does not then exist to warrant such 
rule, it shall be withdrawn.


<R05>
Sec. 424.21  Periodic review.

    At least once every 5 years, the Secretary shall conduct a review of 
each listed species to determine whether it should be delisted or 
reclassified. Each such determination shall be made in accordance with 
Sec. Sec. 424.11, 424.16, and 424.17 of this part, as appropriate. A 
notice announcing those species under active review will be published in 
the Federal Register. Notwithstanding this section's provisions, the 
Secretary may review the status of any species at any time based upon a 
petition (see Sec. 424.14) or upon other data available to the Service.

Sec. 452.02  Definitions.

    Definitions applicable to this part are contained in 50 CFR 450.01.


<R05>
Sec. 452.03  Threshold review and determinations.

    (a) Threshold determinations. Within 20 days after receiving an 
exemption application, or a longer time agreed upon between the 
exemption applicant and the Secretary, the Secretary shall conclude his 
review and determine:
    (1) Whether any required biological assessment was conducted;
    (2) To the extent determinable within the time period provided, 
whether the Federal agency and permit or license applicant, if any, have 
refrained from making any irreversible or irretrievable commitment of 
resources; and
    (3) Whether the Federal agency and permit or license applicant, if 
any, have carried out consultation responsibilities in good faith and 
have made a reasonable and responsible effort to develop and fairly 
consider modifications or reasonable and prudent alternatives to the 
proposed action which would not violate section 7(a)(2) of the Act.
    (b) Burden of proof. The exemption applicant has the burden of 
proving that the requirements of Sec. 452.03(a) have been met.
    (c) Negative finding. If the Secretary makes a negative finding on 
any threshold determination, the Secretary shall deny the application 
and notify the exemption applicant in writing of his finding and grounds 
therefor. The exemption process shall terminate when the applicant 
receives such written notice. The Secretary's denial shall constitute 
final agency action for purposes of judicial review under chapter 7 of 
title 5 of the United States Code.
    (d) Positive finding. If the Secretary makes a positive finding on 
each of the threshold determinations, he shall notify the exemption 
applicant in writing that the application qualifies for consideration by 
the Endangered Species Committee.
    (e) Secretary of State opinion. The Secretary shall terminate the 
exemption process immediately if the Secretary of State, pursuant to his 
obligations under section 7(i) of the Act, certifies in writing to the 
Committee that granting an exemption and carrying out the proposed 
action would violate an international treaty obligation or other 
international obligation of the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 452.04  Secretary's report.

    (a) Contents of the report. If the Secretary has made a positive 
finding on each of the threshold determinations, he shall proceed to 
gather information and prepare a report for the Endangered Species 
Committee:
    (1) Discussing the availability of reasonable and prudent 
alternatives to the proposed action;
    (2) Discussing the nature and extent of the benefits of the proposed 
action;
    (3) Discussing the nature and extent of the benefits of alternative 
courses of action consistent with conserving the species or the critical 
habitat;
    (4) Summarizing the evidence concerning whether the proposed action 
is of national or regional significance;
    (5) Summarizing the evidence concerning whether the proposed action 
is in the public interest;
    (6) Discussing appropriate and reasonable mitigation and enhancement 
measures which should be considered by the Committee in granting an 
exemption; and
    (7) Discussing whether the Federal agency and permit or license 
applicant, if any, have refrained from making any irreversible or 
irretrievable commitment of resources.
    (b) Preparation of the report. The report shall be prepared in 
accordance with procedures set out in Sec. 452.05 and Sec. 452.09.


<R05>
Sec. 452.05  Hearings.

    (a) Hearings. (1) To develop the record for the report under Sec. 
452.04, the Secretary, in consultation with the members of the 
Committee, shall hold a hearing in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 554, 555, 
and 556.
    (2) The Secretary shall designate an Administrative Law Judge to 
conduct the hearing. The Secretary shall assign

[[Page 931]]

technical staff to assist the Administrative Law Judge.
    (3) When the Secretary designates the Administrative Law Judge, the 
Secretary may establish time periods for conducting the hearing and 
closing the record.
    (4) The Secretary may require the applicant to submit further 
discussions of the information required by Sec. 451.02(e)(5). This 
information will be made part of the record.
    (b) Prehearing conferences. (1) The Administrative Law Judge may, on 
his own motion or the motion of a party or intervenor, hold a prehearing 
conference to consider:
    (i) The possibility of obtaining stipulations, admissions of fact or 
law and agreement to the introduction of documents;
    (ii) The limitation of the number of witnesses;
    (iii) Questions of law which may bear upon the course of the 
hearings;
    (iv) Prehearing motions, including motions for discovery; and
    (v) Any other matter which may aid in the disposition of the 
proceedings.
    (2) If time permits and if necessary to materially clarify the 
issues raised at the prehearing conference, the Administrative Law Judge 
shall issue a statement of the actions taken at the conference and the 
agreements made. Such statement shall control the subsequent course of 
the hearing unless modified for good cause by a subsequent statement.
    (c) Notice of hearings. Hearings and prehearing conferences will be 
announced by a notice in the Federal Register stating: (1) The time, 
place and nature of the hearing or prehearing conference; and (2) the 
matters of fact and law to be considered. Such notices will ordinarily 
be published at least 15 days before the scheduled hearings.
    (d) Conduct of hearings--(1) Admissibility of evidence. Relevant, 
material, and reliable evidence shall be admitted. Immaterial, 
irrelevant, unreliable, or unduly repetitious parts of an admissible 
document may be segregated and excluded so far as practicable.
    (2) Motions, objections, rebuttal and cross-examination. Motions and 
objections may be filed with the Administrative Law Judge, rebuttal 
evidence may be submitted, and cross-examination may be conducted, as 
required for a full and true disclosure of the facts, by parties, 
witnesses under subpoena, and their respective counsel.
    (i) Objections. Objections to evidence shall be timely, and the 
party making them may be required to state briefly the grounds relied 
upon.
    (ii) Offers of proof. When an objection is sustained, the examining 
party may make a specific offer of proof and the Administrative Law 
Judge may receive the evidence in full. Such evidence, adequately marked 
for identification, shall be retained in the record for consideration by 
any reviewing authority.
    (iii) Motions. Motions and petitions shall state the relief sought, 
the basis for relief and the authority relied upon. If made before or 
after the hearing itself, these matters shall be in writing and shall be 
filed and served on all parties. If made at the hearing, they may be 
stated and responded to orally, but the Administrative Law Judge may 
require that they be reduced to writing. Oral argument on motions and 
deadlines by which to file responses to written motions will be at the 
discretion of the Administrative Law Judge.
    (e) Applicant responsibility. In proceedings conducted pursuant to 
this section, the exemption applicant has the burden of going forward 
with evidence concerning the criteria for exemption.
    (f) Open meetings and record. All hearings and all hearing records 
shall be open to the public.
    (g) Requests for information, subpoenas. (1) The Administrative Law 
Judge is authorized to exercise the authority of the Committee to 
request, subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, that any person provide 
information necessary to enable the Committee to carry out its duties. 
Any Federal agency or the exemption applicant shall furnish such 
information to the Administrative Law Judge. (2) The Administrative Law 
Judge may exercise the authority of the Committee to issue subpoenas for 
the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of relevant 
papers, books, and documents.

[[Page 932]]

    (h) Information collection. The information collection requirements 
contained in Sec. 452.05 do not require approval by the Office of 
Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq., because it is 
anticipated there will be fewer than ten respondents annually.


<R05>
Sec. 452.06  Parties and intervenors.

    (a) Parties. The parties shall consist of the exemption applicant, 
the Federal agency responsible for the agency action in question, the 
Service, and intervenors whose motions to intervene have been granted.
    (b) Intervenors. (1) The Administrative Law Judge shall provide an 
opportunity for intervention in the hearing. A motion to intervene must 
state the petitioner's name and address, identify its representative, if 
any, set forth the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding and show 
that the petitioner's participation would assist in the determination of 
the issues in question.
    (2) The Administrative Law Judge shall grant leave to intervene if 
he determines that an intervenor's participation would contribute to the 
fair determination of issues. In making this determination, the 
Administrative Law Judge may consider whether an intervenor represents a 
point of view not adequately represented by a party or another 
intervenor.


<R05>
Sec. 452.07  Separation of functions and ex parte communications.

    (a) Separation of functions. (1) The Administrative Law Judge and 
the technical staff shall not be responsible for or subject to the 
supervision or direction of any person who participated in the 
endangered species consultation at issue;
    (2) The Secretary shall not allow an agency employee or agent who 
participated in the endangered species consultation at issue or a 
factually related matter to participate or advise in a determination 
under this part except as a witness or counsel in public proceedings.

to the hearing and the preparation of the report.


<R05>
Sec. 452.08  Submission of Secretary's report.

    (a) Upon closing of the record, the Administrative Law Judge shall 
certify the record and transmit it to the Secretary for preparation of 
the Secretary's report which shall be based on the record. The Secretary 
may direct the Administrative Law Judge to reopen the record and obtain 
additional information if he determines that such action is necessary.
    (b) The Secretary shall submit his report and the record of the 
hearing to the Committee within 140 days after making his threshold 
determinations under Sec. 452.03(a) or within such other period of time 
as is mutually agreeable to the applicant and the Secretary.


<R05>
Sec. 452.09  Consolidated and joint proceedings.

    (a) When the Secretary is considering two or more related exemption 
applications, the Secretary may consider them jointly and prepare a 
joint report if doing so would expedite or simplify consideration of the 
issues.
    (b) When the Secretaries of the Interior and Commerce are 
considering two or more related exemption applications, they may 
consider them jointly and prepare a joint report if doing so would 
expedite or simplify consideration of the issues.

<R05>
Sec. 453.02  Definitions.

    Definitions applicable to this part are contained in 50 CFR 450.01.


<R05>
Sec. 453.03  Committee review and final determinations.

    (a) Final determinations. Within 30 days of receiving the 
Secretary's report and record, the Committee shall grant an exemption 
from the requirements of section 7(a)(2) of the Act for an agency action 
if, by a vote in which at least five of its members concur:
    (1) It determines that based on the report to the Secretary, the 
record of the hearing held under Sec. 452.05, and on such other 
testimony or evidence as it may receive:
    (i) There are no reasonable and prudent alternatives to the proposed 
action;
    (ii) The benefits of such action clearly outweigh the benefits of 
alternative courses of action consistent with conserving the species or 
its critical habitat, and such action is in the public interest;
    (iii) The action is of regional or national significance; and
    (iv) Neither the Federal agency concerned nor the exemption 
applicant made any irreversible or irretrievable commitment of resources 
prohibited by section 7(d) of the Act; and,
    (2) It establishes such reasonable mitigation and enhancement 
measures, including, but not limited to, live propagation, 
transplantation, and habitat acquisition and improvement, as are 
necessary and appropriate to minimize the adverse effects of the 
proposed action upon the endangered species, threatened species, or 
critical habitat concerned. Any required mitigation and enhancement 
measures shall be carried out and paid for by the exemption applicant.
    (b) Decision and order. The Committee's final determinations shall 
be documented in a written decision. If the Committee determines that an 
exemption should be granted, the Committee shall issue an order granting 
the exemption and specifying required mitigation and enhancement 
measures. The Committee shall publish its decision and order in the 
Federal Register as soon as practicable.
    (c) Permanent exemptions. Under section 7(h)(2) of the Act, an 
exemption granted by the Committee shall constitute a permanent 
exemption with respect to all endangered or threatened species for the 
purposes of completing such agency action--
    (1) Regardless of whether the species was identified in the 
biological assessment, and
    (2) Only if a biological assessment has been conducted under section 
7(c) of the Act with respect to such agency action. Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, an exemption shall not be permanent if--
    (i) The Secretary finds, based on the best scientific and commercial 
data available, that such exemption would result in the extinction of a 
species that was not the subject of consultation under section 7(a)(2) 
of the Act or was not identified in any biological assessment conducted 
under section 7(c) of the Act, and
    (ii) The Committee determines within 60 days after the date of the 
Secretary's finding that the exemption should not be permanent.

If the Secretary makes a finding that the exemption would result in the 
extinction of a species, as specified above, the Committee shall meet 
with respect to the matter within 30 days after the date of the finding. 
During the 60 day period following the Secretary's determination, the 
holder of the exemption shall refrain from any action which would result 
in extinction of the species.
    (d) Finding by the Secretary of Defense. If the Secretary of Defense 
finds in writing that an exemption for the agency action is necessary 
for reasons of national security, the Committee shall grant the 
exemption notwithstanding any other provision in this part.


<R05>
Sec. 453.04  Committee information gathering.

    (a) Written submissions. When the Chairman or four Committee members 
decide that written submissions are necessary to enable the Committee to

the Federal Register inviting written submissions from interested 
persons.

[[Page 934]]

The notice shall include: (1) The address to which such submissions are 
to be sent; (2) the deadline for such submissions; and (3) a statement

<R05>
Sec. 501.1  Purpose and scope.

    (a) Purpose. The purpose of these rules is to fulfill the 
responsibilities of the Marine Mammal Commission (the ``Commission'') 
under section 3 of the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a(f) (the 
``Act'') by establishing procedures whereby an individual will be 
notified if any system of records maintained by the Commission contains 
a record pertaining to him or her; by defining the times and places at 
which records will be made available and the identification requirements 
which must be met by any individual requesting access to them; by 
establishing procedures for disclosure to an individual, on request, of 
any record pertaining to him or her; and by establishing procedures for 
processing, reviewing, and making a final determination on requests of 
individuals to correct or amend a record pertaining to him or her, 
including a provision for administrative appeal of initial adverse 
determinations on such requests. These rules are promulgated with 
particular attention to the purposes and goals of the Act, and in 
accordance therewith provide for relative ease of access to records 
pertaining to an individual, and for maintenance by the Commission of 
only those records which are current, accurate, necessary, relevant and 
complete with respect to the purposes for which they were collected.
    (b) Scope. These rules apply only to ``record'' contained in 
``systems of records,'' defined by the Act as follows:

    The term ``record'' means any item, collection, or grouping of 
information about an individual that is maintained by an agency, 
including, but not limited to, his education, financial transactions, 
medical history, and criminal or employment history and that contains 
his name, or the identifying number, symbol, or other identifying 
particular assigned to the individual, such as a finger or voice print 
or a photograph;
    The term ``system of records'' means of group of any record under 
the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the 
name of the individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other 
identifying particular assigned to the individual.


Notices with respect to the systems maintained by the Commission have 
been published in the Federal Register, as required by the Act. These 
rules pertain only to the systems of records disclosed in such notices, 
and to any systems that may become the subject of a notice at any time 
in the future.
    (c) Nothing in these rules shall be construed as pertaining to 
requests made under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552.


<R05>
Sec. 501.2  Definitions.

    (a) As used in this part:
    (1) The term Act means the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a.

    (3) The term Director means the Executive Director of the Marine 
Mammal Commission.
    (4) The term Privacy Officer means an individual designated by the 
Director to receive all requests regarding the existence of records, 
requests for access and requests for correction or amendment; to review 
and make initial determinations regarding all such requests; and to 
provide assistance to any individual wishing to exercise his or her 
rights under the Act.
    (b) Other terms shall be used in this part in accordance with the 
definitions contained in section 3 of the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C.

<R05>
Sec. 501.3  Procedure for responding to requests regarding the 
existence of records pertaining to an individual.

    Any individual may submit a request to be notified whether a system 
of records, with respect to which the Commission has published a notice 
in the Federal Register, contains a record pertaining to him or her. 
Requests may be made in writing to the Privacy Officer or by appearing 
in person at the Commission offices located at 1625 I Street, NW., Room 
307, Washington, DC 20006 between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. 
on any working day. Systems of records that are the subject of a request 
should be identified by reference to the system name designated in the 
Notice of Systems of Records published in the Federal Register. In the 
event a system name is not known to the individual, a general request 
will suffice if it indicates reasons for the belief that a record 
pertaining to the named individual is maintained by the Commission. 
Receipt of inquiries submitted by mail will be acknowledged within 10 
days of receipt (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public 
holidays) unless a response can also be prepared and forwarded to the 
individual within that time.


<R05>
Sec. 501.4  Requests for access--times, places and requirements for
identification of individuals.

    Requests for access to a system of records pertaining to any 
individual may be made by that individual by mail addressed to the 
Privacy Officer, or by submitting a written request in person at the 
Commission offices located at 1625 I Street, NW., Room 307, Washington, 
DC 20006, between the hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. on any working day. 
Assistance in gaining access under this section, securing an amendment 
or correction under Sec. 501.6, or preparing an appeal under Sec. Sec. 
501.5(d) and 501.8 shall be provided by the Privacy Officer on request 
directed to the Commission office. An individual appearing in person at 
the Commission offices will be granted immediate access to any records 
to which that individual is entitled under the Act upon satisfactory 
proof of identity by means of a document bearing the individual's 
photograph or signature. For requests made by mail, identification of 
the individual shall be adequate if established by means of submitting a 
certificate of a notary public, or equivalent officer empowered to 
administer oaths, substantially in accord with the following:

    City of ------------ County of --------------: ss (Name of 
individual) who affixed (his) (her) signature below in my presence, came 
before me, a (Title), in the aforesaid County and State, this ----------
-- day of ------------, 19----, and established (his)(her) identity to 
my satisfaction.
    My Commission expires ------------------------.


The certificate shall not be required, however, for written requests 
pertaining to non-sensitive information or to information which would be 
required to be made available under the Freedom of Information Act. The 
Privacy Officer shall determine the adequacy of any proof of identity 
offered by an individual.

[41 FR 5, Jan. 2, 1976]


<R05>
Sec. 501.5  Disclosure of requested information.

    (a) Upon request and satisfactory proof of identity, an individual 
appearing at the Commission offices shall be given immediate access to 
and permission to review any record, contained in a system of records, 
pertaining to him or her, shall be allowed to have a person of his/her 
choosing accompany him/her, and shall be given a copy of all or any 
portion of the record. The individual to which access is granted shall 
be required to sign a written statement authorizing the presence of the 
person who accompanies him or her, and authorizing discussion of his or 
her record in the presence of the accompanying person.
    (b) Requests made by mail to the Privacy Officer at the Commission 
offices will be acknowledged within 10 days from date of receipt 
(excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays). This 
acknowledgement shall advise the individual whether access to the record 
will be granted and, if access is granted, copies of such records shall 
be enclosed.
    (c) If the Privacy Officer initially determines to deny access to 
all or any

[[Page 939]]

portion of a record, notice of denial shall be given to the individual 
in writing, within 30 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) 
after acknowledgement is given, and shall include the following:
    (1) The precise record to which access is being denied;
    (2) The reason for denial, including a citation to the appropriate 
provisions of the Act and of these Rules;
    (3) A statement that the denial may be appealed to the Director;
    (4) A statement of what steps must be taken to perfect an appeal to 
the Director; and,
    (5) A statement that the individual has a right to judicial review 
under 5 U.S.C. 552a(g)(1) of any final denial issued by the Director.
    (d) Administrative appeal of an initial denial, in whole or in part, 
of any request for access to a record, shall be available. An individual 
may appeal by submitting to the Director a written request for 
reconsideration stating therein specific reasons for reversal which 
address directly the reasons for denial stated in the initial notice of 
denial. If access is denied on appeal, a final notice of denial shall be 
sent to the individual within 30 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and 
holidays), and shall state with particularity the grounds for rejecting 
all reasons for reversal submitted by the individual. The denial shall 
then be deemed final for purposes of obtaining judicial review.

Sec. 501.6  Requests for correction or amendment of a record.

    (a) Any individual may request the correction or amendment of a 
record pertaining to him or her in writing addressed to the Privacy 
Officer at the Commission offices. Verification of identity required for 
such requests shall be the same as that specified in Sec. 501.4 of this 
part with respect to requests for access. Records sought to be amended 
must be identified with as much specificity as is practicable under the 
circumstances of the request, and at a minimum, should refer to the 
system name designated in the Notice of System Records published in the 
Federal Register, the type of record in which the information thought to 
be improperly maintained or incorrect is contained, and the precise 
information that is the subject of the request (for example, system 
name, description of record, paragraph, sentence, line, words). 
Assistance in identifying a record, and in otherwise preparing a 
request, may be obtained by contacting the Privacy Officer at the 
Commission offices.
    (b) A request should, in addition to identifying the individual and 
the record sought to be amended or corrected, include:
    (1) The specific wording or other information to be deleted, if any;
    (2) The specific wording or other information to be inserted, if 
any, and the exact place in the record at which it is to be inserted, 
and,
    (3) A statement of the basis for the requested amendment or 
correction (e.g. that the record is inaccurate, unnecessary, irrelevant, 
untimely, or incomplete), together with supporting documents, if any, 
which substantiate the statement.


<R05>
Sec. 501.7  Agency review of requests for amendment or correction
of a record.

    (a) Where possible, each request for amendment or correction shall 
be reviewed, and a determination on the request made, by the Privacy 
Officer within 10 days of receipt (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and 
holidays). Requests shall be acknowledged within that period where 
insufficient information has been provided to enable action to be taken. 
An acknowledgement shall inform the individual making the request of the 
estimated time within which a disposition of the request is expected to 
be made, and shall prescribe such further information as may be 
necessary to process the request. The request shall be granted, or an 
initial decision to deny shall be made, within ten days of receipt of 
all information specified in the acknowledgement (excluding Saturdays, 
Sundays and holidays).
    (b) Within 30 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) after 
arriving at a decision on a request, the Privacy Officer shall either:

[[Page 940]]

    (1) Make the requested amendment or correction, in whole or in part, 
and advise the individual in writing of such action; or,
    (2) Advise the individual in writing that the request has been 
initially denied, in whole or in part, stating, with respect to those 
portions denied;
    (i) The date of the denial;
    (ii) The reasons for the denial, including a citation to an 
appropriate section of the Act and these Rules; and,
    (iii) The right of the individual to prosecute an appeal and to 
obtain judicial review should a final denial result from the appeal.
    (c) In reviewing a request for amendment or correction of a record, 
the Privacy Officer shall consider the following criteria:
    (1) The sufficiency of the evidence submitted by the individual;
    (2) The factual accuracy of the information sought to be amended or 
corrected;
    (3) The relevance and necessity of the information sought to be 
amended or corrected in terms of the purposes for which it was 
collected;
    (4) The timeliness and currency of the information sought to be 
amended or corrected in terms of the purposes for which it was 
collected;
    (5) The completeness of the information sought to be amended or 
corrected in terms of the purposes for which it was collected;
    (6) The degree of possibility that denial of the request could 
unfairly result in determinations adverse to the individual;
    (7) The character of the record sought to be corrected or amended; 
and,
    (8) The propriety and feasibility of complying with the specific 
means of correction or amendment requested by the individual. If an 
amendment or correction is otherwise permissible under the Act and other 
relevant statutes, a request shall be denied only if the individual has 
failed to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, the propriety 
of the amendment or correction in light of these criteria.

    (a) The initial denial of a request for amendment or correction may 
be appealed by submitting to the Director the following appeal papers:
    (1) A copy of the original request for amendment or correction;
    (2) A copy of the initial denial; and
    (3) A precise statement of the reasons for the individual's belief 
that the denial is in error, referring specifically to the criteria 
contained in Sec. 501.7(c)(1) through (8).

The appeal must be signed by the individual. While these papers normally 
will constitute the entire Record on Appeal, the Director may add 
additional information, from sources other than the individual, where 
necessary to facilitate a final determination. Any such additional 
information added to the record shall promptly be disclosed to the 
individual to the greatest extent possible, and an opportunity for 
comment thereon shall be afforded prior to the final determination. 
Appeals should be submitted to the Director within 90 days after the 
date of the initial denial.
    (b) The Director shall issue a final determination on appeal within 
thirty days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) 
from the date on which a completed Record on Appeal (including any 
additional information deemed necessary) is received. Review, and final 
determination by the Director, shall be based upon the criteria 
specified in Sec. 501.7(c)(1) through (8).
    (c) If the appeal is resolved favorably to the individual, the final 
determination shall specify the amendments or corrections to be made. 
Copies of the final determination shall be transmitted promptly to the 
individual and to the Privacy Officer. The Privacy Officer shall make 
the requested amendment or correction and advise the individual in 
writing of such action.
    (d) If the appeal is denied, the final determination shall state, 
with particularity, the reasons for denial, including a citation to an 
appropriate section of the Act and of these Rules. The final 
determination shall be forwarded promptly to the individual, together 
with a notice which shall inform

[[Page 941]]

the individual of his or her right to submit to the Privacy Officer, for 
inclusion in the record, a concise statement of grounds for disagreement 
with the final determination. Receipt of any such statement shall be 
acknowledged by the Privacy Officer, and all subsequent and prior users 
of the record shall be provided copies of the statement. The notice 
shall also inform the individual of his or her right, under 5 U.S.C. 
552a(g)(1), to obtain judicial review of the final determination.

<R05>
Sec. 501.9  Fees.

    A fee of $0.10 shall be charged for each copy of each page of a 
record made, by photocopy or similar process, at the request of an 
individual. No fee shall be charged for copies made at the initiative of 
the Commission incident to granting access to a record. A total copying 
fee of $2.00 or less may be waived by the Privacy Officer, but fees for 
all requests made contemporaneously by an individual shall be aggregated 
to determine the total fee.

    (6) Personnel and medical files and similar files, the disclosure of 
which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal 
privacy;
    (7) Investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, but 
only to the extent that the production of such records would:
    (i) Interfere with enforcement proceedings,
    (ii) Deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial 
adjudication,
    (iii) Constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,
    (iv) Disclose the identity of a confidential source and, in the case 
of a record compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the 
course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful 
national security intelligence investigation, confidential information

location for the use of any person who is granted permission to inspect 
such materials.
    (b) Requests to inspect, and obtain copies of, any material 
maintained by the Commission may be made in person at the Commission 
offices, or submitted in writing to the Executive Director, Marine 
Mammal Commission, 1625 I St., NW., Room 307, Washington, DC 20006. Each 
request should include a reasonable description of the material being 
sought, and should contain sufficient detail to facilitate retrieval of 
the material without undue delay. The Commission staff shall assist to 
the extent practicable in identifying material that is imprecisely 
described by the person requesting such material.
    (c) An initial determination whether, and to what extent, to grant 
each request shall be made by the General Counsel or his delegate within 
10 days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after 
receipt of that request. The person making the request shall be notified 
immediately of the determination made. In making such determinations, it 
shall first be considered whether the material requested is of a type 
described in Sec. 520.2(a); if it is, the request shall be granted 
unless the material is exempted by Sec. 520.2(b). If the material 
requested is not of a type described in Sec. 520.2(a), or is the 
subject of one or more exemptions, the request shall be denied.
    (d) If a determination is made to grant a request, the relevant 
material shall promptly be made available for inspection at the

within a reasonable time after payment of the fee specified in Sec. 
520.7. Copies of less than 10 pages of material requested in person 
ordinarily will be furnished immediately following the determination to 
grant the request and payment of the fee. Larger numbers of copies may 
be furnished at the earliest convenience of the Commission staff, but 
must be furnished within a reasonable time following payment of the fee.
    (e) Whenever required to prevent a clearly unwarranted invasion of 
personal privacy, the General Counsel or his delegate shall determine 
that identifying details shall be deleted from an opinion, statement of 
policy, interpretation, or staff manual or instruction to which access 
is granted or of which copies are furnished. Where portions of the 
requested material are exempt under Sec. 520.2(b), and are reasonably 
segregable from the remainder of the material, those portions shall be 
excised from the material disclosed. Whenever details are deleted or 
portions are excised and not disclosed, the notification shall include 
the information specified in Sec. 520.4(f).
    (f) If a determination is made to deny a request, the notification 
shall include a statement of the reasons for such action, shall set 
forth the name and position of the person responsible for the denial,

[[Page 945]]


<R05>
Sec. 520.5  Administrative appeal.

    (a) An appeal to the Director of any denial, in whole or in part, of 
a request for access to and copies of material may be made by submission 
of a written request for reconsideration. Such requests must state 
specific reasons for reconsideration that address directly the grounds 
upon which the denial was based. Requests should be addressed to the 
Director at the Commission offices.
    (b) The Director shall make a determination with respect to any 
appeal within 20 days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public 
holidays) after receipt of the request for reconsideration. The person 
making such a request shall immediately be notified by mail of the 
determination.
    (c) If the initial denial is reversed by the Director, any material 
with which the reversal is concerned shall be made available for 
inspection, and copies shall be furnished, in accordance with Sec. 
520.4(d).
    (d) If the denial is upheld, in whole or in part, the Director shall 
include in the notification a statement of the requester's right of 
judicial review under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4), and the names and positions of 
the persons responsible for the denial.


<R05>
Sec. 520.6  Extensions of time.

    (a) Whenever unusual circumstances exist, as set forth in Sec. 
520.6(b), the times within which determinations must be made by the 
General Counsel on requests for access (10 working days), and by the 
Director on requests for reconsideration (20 working days), may be 
extended by written notice to the requester. The notice shall set forth 
the reasons for such extension, and the date on which a determination is 
expected to be made. The maximum extension of time allowed under this 
section shall be 10 working days, but shall be utilized only to the 
extent reasonably necessary to the proper processing of the particular 
request.
    (b) As used in this section, ``unusual circumstances'' shall mean:
    (1) The need to search for and collect the requested records from 
field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the 
Commission offices;
    (2) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a 
voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are the subject 
of a single request; or
    (3) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all 
practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in 
the determination of the request or among two or more components of the 
agency having substantial subject-matter interest therein.


<R05>
Sec. 520.7  Fees.

    (a) The following standard charges for document search and 
duplication, based on the direct costs of such services, must be paid 
before access to, or copies of material will be granted under these 
regulations:
    (1) Search: $4.00 per person-hour for clerical time; $8.00 per 
person-hour for professional or supervisory time;
    (2) Duplication: $0.10 per page of photocopied material.
    (b) The Commission shall furnish without charge, or at a reduced 
charge, copies of any material disclosed pursuant to these regulations, 
whenever the General Counsel or the Director determines that waiver or 
reduction of the fee is in the public interest because furnishing the 
information can be considered as primarily benefiting the general 
public.

<R05>
Sec. 530.1  Purpose.

    The purpose of this part is to establish procedures which supplement 
the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations and provide for 
the implementation of those provisions

[[Page 946]]

identified in Sec. 1507.3(b) of the regulations which are applicable to 
the activities of the Commission in light of its statutory functions and 
responsibilities.


<R05>
Sec. 530.2  Ensuring that environmental documents are actually 
considered in agency decision-making.

    Section 1505.1 of the NEPA regulations contains requirements to 
ensure adequate consideration of environmental documents in agency 
decision-making. To implement these requirements, Commission officials 
shall:
    (a) Consider all relevant environmental documents in evaluating 
proposals for agency actions;
    (b) Ensure that all relevant environmental documents, comments, and 
responses accompany the proposal through existing agency review 
processes;
    (c) Consider only those alternatives encompassed by the range of 
alternatives discussed in the relevant environmental documents when 
evaluating any proposal for action by the Commission which is likely to 
significantly affect the quality of the human environment; and
    (d) Where an environmental impact statement (EIS) has been prepared, 
consider the specific alternatives analyzed in the EIS when evaluating 
the proposal which is the subject of the EIS. All Commission officials 
directly involved in developing, evaluating, and/or reaching decisions 
on proposed actions shall consider relevant environmental documents and 
comply with the applicable provisions of the NEPA process.


<R05>
Sec. 530.3  Typical classes of action.

    Section 1507.3(b)(2), in conjunction with Sec. 1508.4, requires 
agencies to identify typical classes of action that warrant similar 
treatment under NEPA with respect to the preparation of EIS's or 
environmental assessments. As a general matter, the Commission's 
activities do not include actions for which EIS's or environmental 
assessments are required. Its activities involve:
    (a) Consultation with and recommendations to other Federal agencies 
for actions relating to marine mammal protection and conservation for 
which an EIS or environmental assessment is either not required by the 
NEPA regulations or for which an EIS or environmental assessment is 
prepared by another Federal agency; and
    (b) Research contracts relating to policy issues, biological-
ecological data needed to make sound management decisions, and better 
methods for collecting and analyzing data. These activities are not, by 
themselves, major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of 
the human environment and the Commission's activities are therefore 
categorically excluded from the requirement to prepare an EIS or 
environmental assessment except for proposals for legislation which are 
initiated by the Commission, for which the Commission shall develop 
environmental assessments or EIS's, as appropriate, in accordance with 
the NEPA regulations. The Commission shall independently determine 
whether an EIS or an environmental assessment is required where:
    (1) A proposal for agency action is not covered by one of the 
typical classes of action above; or

Sec. 540.1  Policy.

    It is the policy of the Marine Mammal Commission to act in 
accordance with Executive Order 12356 in matters relating to national 
security information.

<R05>
Sec. 540.2  Program.

    The Executive Director is designated as the Commission's official 
responsible for implementation and oversight of information security 
programs and procedures. He acts as the recipient of questions, 
suggestions, and complaints regarding all elements of this program, and 
is solely responsible for changes to it and for insuring that it is at 
all times consistent with Executive Order 12356. The Executive Director 
also serves as the Commission's official contact for requests for 
declassification of materials submitted under the provisions of 
Executive Order 12356, regardless of the point of origin of such 
requests. He is responsible for assuring that requests submitted under 
the Freedom of Information Act are handled in accordance with that Act 
and that declassification requests submitted under the provisions of 
Executive Order 12356 are acted upon within 60 days of receipt.

[44 FR 55381, Sept. 26, 1979]


<R05>
Sec. 540.3  Procedures.

    (a) Mandatory declassification review. All requests for mandatory 
review shall be handled by the Executive Director or his designee. Under 
no circumstances shall the Exective Director refuse to confirm the 
existence or non-existence of a document requested under the Freedom of 
Information Act or the mandatory review provisions of Executive Order 
12356, unless the fact of its existence or non-existence would itself be 
classified under Executive Order 12356. Requests for declassification 
shall be acted upon promptly providing that the request reasonably 
describes the information which is the subject of the request for 
declassification. In light of the fact that the Commission does not have 
original classification authority and national security information in 
its custody has been classified by another Federal agency, the Executive 
Director will refer all requests for national security information in 
its custody to the Federal agency that classified it or, if the agency 
that classified it has either ceased to exist or transferred the 
information in conjunction with a transfer of functions, to the 
appropriate federal agency exercising original classification authority 
with respect to the same subject, for review and disposition in 
accordance with Executive Order 12356 and that agency's regulations and 
guidelines.
    (b) Exceptional cases. When an employee or contractor of the 
Commission originates information that is believed to require 
classification, the Executive Director shall ensure that it is protected 
in accordance with Executive Order 12356 and shall promptly transmit it 
under appropriate safeguards to the agency with appropriate subject 
matter jurisdiction and classification authority for review and action 
in accordance with the Order and that agency's regulations and 
guidelines.
    (c) Derivative classification. Derivative classification markings 
shall be applied to information that is in substance the same as 
information that is already classified, in accordance with Executive 
Order 12356, Section 2-1, unless it is determined through inquiries made 
to the originators of the classified information or other appropriate 
persons that the paraphrasing, restating, or summarizing of the 
classified information obviates the need for its classification, in 
which case the information shall be issued as unclassified or shall be 
marked appropriately. After verifying the current level of 
classification so far as practicable, paper copies of such derivatively 
classified information shall be marked so as to indicate:
    (1) The source of the original classification;
    (2) The identity of the Commission employee originating the 
derivatively classified document;
    (3) The dates or events for declassification or review for 
declassification indicated on the classified source material; and
    (4) Any additional authorized markings appearing on the source 
material.
    (d) Handling. All classified documents shall be delivered to the 
Executive Director or his designee immediately upon receipt. All 
potential recipients of such documents shall be advised of the names of 
such designees and updated information as necessary. In the event that 
the Executive Director or his designee is not available to receive

[[Page 948]]

such documents, they shall be turned over to the Administrative Officer 
and secured, unopened, in the combination safe located in the Commission 
offices until the Executive Director or his designee is available. Under 
no circumstances shall classified materials that cannot be delivered to 
the Executive Director or his designee be stored other than in the 
designated safe.
    (e) Reproduction. Reproduction of classified material shall take 
place only in accordance with Executive Order 12356, its implementing 
directives, and any limitations imposed by the originator. Should copies 
be made, they are subject to the same controls as the original document. 
Records showing the number and distribution of copies shall be 
maintained, where required by the Executive Order, by the Administrative 
Officer and the log stored with the original documents. These measures 
shall not restrict reproduction for the purposes of mandatory review.
    (f) Storage. All classified documents shall be stored in the 
combination safe located in the Commission's offices. The combination 
shall be changed as required by ISOO Directive No. 1, dated June 23, 
1982. The combination shall be known only to the Executive Director and 
his designees with the appropriate security clearance.
    (g) Employee education. All employees who have been granted a 
security clearance and who have occasion to handle classified materials 
shall be advised of handling, reproduction, and storage procedures and 
shall be required to review Executive Order 12356 and appropriate ISOO 
directives. This shall be effected by a memorandum to all affected 
employees at the time these procedures are implemented. New employees 
will be instructed in procedures as they enter employment with the 
Commission.
    (h) Agency terminology. The use of the terms Top Secret, Secret, and 
Confidential shall be limited to materials classified for national 
security purposes.

Sec. 550.140  Employment.

    No qualified handicapped person shall, on the basis of handicap, be 
subjected to discrimination in employment under any program or activity

Sec. Sec. 550.141-550.148  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 550.149  Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

    Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 550.150, no qualified 
handicapped person shall, because the agency's facilities are 
inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons, be denied the 
benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be 
subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by 
the agency.


<R05>
Sec. 550.150  Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

    (a) General. The agency shall operate each program or activity so 
that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily 
accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does 
not--
    (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing 
facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons; or
    (2) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate 
would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or 
activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those 
circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action 
would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in 
undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of 
proving that compliance with Sec. 550.150(a) would result in such 
alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such 
alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her 
designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the 
funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be 
accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that 
conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such 
burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in 
such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that 
handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or 
activity.
    (b) Methods. The agency may comply with the requirements of this 
section

[[Page 952]]

through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to 
accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, 
delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of 
existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of 
accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its 
programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by handicapped 
persons. The agency is nor required to make structural changes in 
existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving 
compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to 
existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent 
compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 
U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing 
among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, 
the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and 
activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most integrated 
setting appropriate.
    (c) Time period for compliance. The agency shall comply with the 
obligations established under this section by June 6, 1986, except that 
where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes 
shall be made by April 7, 1989, but in any event as expeditiously as 
possible.
    (d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to 
facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the 
agency shall develop, by October 7, 1986, a transition plan setting 
forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall 
provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped 
persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to 
participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting 
comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be 
made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum--
    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that 
limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped 
persons;
    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;
    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition 
plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during 
each year of the transition period; and
    (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the 
plan.

Sec. 550.151  Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.

    Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered 
by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, 
constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by 
handicapped persons. The definitions, requirements, and standards of the 
Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established in 41

    (a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective 
communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal 
entities, and members of the public.
    (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where 
necessary to afford a handicapped person an equal opportunity to 
participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity 
conducted by the agency.
    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the 
agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the 
handicapped person.
    (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, 
readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal 
nature.
    (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries 
by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or 
equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used.
    (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including 
persons

[[Page 953]]

with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the 
existence and location of accessible services, activities, and 
facilities.
    (c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each 
of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which 
they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The 
international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary 
entrance of an accessible facility.
    (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that 
it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the 
nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative 
burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the 
proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or 
would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency 
has the burden of proving that compliance with Sec. 550.160 would 
result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would 
result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or 
his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for 
use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, 
and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for 
reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this 
section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency 
shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration 
or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum 
extent possible, handicapped persons receive the benefits and services 
of the program or activity.

entity.
    (f) The agency shall notify the Architectural and Transportation 
Barriers Compliance Board upon receipt of any complaint alleging that a 
building or facility that is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act 
of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), or section 502 of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 792), is not readily

he or she shall have 60 days from the date of receipt of the additional 
information to make his or her determination on the appeal.
    (k) The time limits cited in paragraphs (g) and (j) of this section 
may be extended with the permission of the Assistant Attorney General.

Sec. 560.1  Purpose and scope.

    This part contains the regulations of the Marine Mammal Commission

Consistent with the Act, it is the policy of the Marine Mammal 
Commission that the public is entitled to the fullest practicable

this part set forth the basic responsibilities of the Commission with 
regard to this policy and offer guidance to members of the public who 
wish to exercise the rights established by the Act. These regulations 
also fulfill the requirement of 5 U.S.C. 552b(g) that each agency 
subject to the Act promulgate regulations to implement the open meeting 
requirements of subsections (b) through (f) of section 552b.

have an interest in the subject matter of the meeting; and
    (4) Other means that the Executive Director deems appropriate to

    (d) A meeting may be held with less than 7 days notice if a majority 
of the members of the Commission determine by recorded vote that the 
business of the Commission so requires. The Commission shall make a 
public announcement to this effect at the earliest practicable time. The 
announcement shall include the information required by paragraph (b) of 
this section and shall be issued in accordance with those procedures set 
forth in paragraph (c) of this section that are practicable given the 
available period of time.
    (e) The subject matter of an announced meeting, or the determination 
of the Commission to open or close a meeting or portions thereof to 
public observation, may be changed if a majority of the members of the 
Commission determine by recorded vote that Commission business so 
requires and that no earlier announcement of the change was possible. 
The Commission shall make a public announcement of the changes made and 
the vote of each member on each change at the earliest practicable time. 
The announcement shall be issued in accordance with those procedures set 
forth in paragraph (c) of this section that are practicable given the 
available period of time.
    (f) The time or place of an announced meeting may be changed only if

<R05>
Sec. 560.5  Closed meetings.

    (a) A meeting or portions thereof may be closed, and information 
pertaining to such meeting or portions

[[Page 956]]

thereof may be withheld from the public, only if the Commission 
determines that such meeting or portions thereof, or the disclosure of 
such information, is likely to:
    (1) Disclose matters that are (i) specifically authorized under 
criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the 
interest of national defense or foreign policy and (ii) in fact properly 
classified pursuant to that Executive order;
    (2) Relate solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of 
the Commission;
    (3) Disclose matters specifically exempted from disclosure by 
statute (other than the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552), 
provided that the statute:
    (i) Requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a 
manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or
    (ii) Establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to 
particular types of matters to be withheld;
    (4) Disclose the trade secrets and commercial or financial 
information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential;
    (5) Involve either accusing any person of a crime or formally 
censuring any person;
    (6) Disclose information of a personal nature, if disclosure would 
constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;
    (7) Disclose either investigatory records compiled for law 
enforcement purposes or information which if written would be contained 
in such records, but only to the extent that the production of the 
records or information would:
    (i) Interfere with enforcement proceedings,
    (ii) Deprive a person of a right to either a fair trial or an 
impartial ajudication,
    (iii) Constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,
    (iv) Disclose the identity of a confidential source or sources and, 
in the case of a record compiled either by a criminal law enforcement 
authority in the course of a criminal investigation or by an agency 
conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, 
confidential information furnished only by the confidential source or 
sources,
    (v) Disclose investigative techniques and procedures, or
    (vi) Endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement 
personnel;
    (8) Disclose information contained in or related to examination, 
operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the 
use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of 
financial institutions;
    (9) Disclose information the premature disclosure of which would be 
likely to significantly frustrate implementation of a proposed action of 
the Commission. This exception shall not apply in any instance where the 
Commission has already disclosed to the public the content or nature of 
the proposed action or where the Commission is required by law to make 
such disclosure on its own initiative prior to taking final action on 
the proposal; or
    (10) Specifically concern the issuance of a subpoena by the 
Commission, or the participation of the Commission in a civil action or 
proceeding, an action in a foreign court or international tribunal, or 
an arbitration, or the initiation, conduct, or disposition by the 
Commission of a particular case of formal adjudication pursuant to the 
procedures in 5 U.S.C. 554 or otherwise involving a determination on the 
record after opportunity for a hearing.
    (b) Before a meeting or portions thereof may be closed to public 
observation, the Commission shall determine, notwithstanding the 
exemptions set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, whether or not 
the public interest requires that the meeting or portions thereof be 
open. The Commission may open a meeting or portions thereof that could 
be closed under paragraph (a) of this section if the Commission finds it 
to be in the public interest to do so.


<R05>
Sec. 560.6  Procedures for closing meetings.

    (a) A meeting or portions thereof may be closed and information 
pertaining to such meeting or portions thereof may be withheld under 
Sec. 560.5 of this part only when a majority of the members of the 
Commission vote to take such action.

[[Page 957]]

    (b) A separate vote of the members of the Commission shall be taken 
with respect to each meeting or portion thereof proposed to be closed 
and with respect to information which is proposed to be withheld. A 
single vote may be taken with respect to a series of meetings or 
portions thereof which are proposed to be closed, so long as each 
meeting or portion thereof in such series involves the same particular 
matter and is scheduled to be held no more than thirty days after the 
initial meeting in such series. The vote of each participating 
Commission member shall be recorded, and no proxies shall be allowed.
    (c) A person whose interests may be directly affected by a portion 
of a meeting may request in writing that the Commission close that 
portion of the meeting for any of the reasons referred to in Sec. 
560.5(a) (5), (6) or (7) of this part. Upon the request of a 
Commissioner, a recorded vote shall be taken whether to close such 
meeting or a portion thereof.
    (d) Before the Commission may hold a meeting that is closed, in 
whole or part, a certification shall be obtained from the General 
Counsel that, in his or her opinion, the meeting may properly be closed. 
The certification shall be in writing and shall state each applicable 
exemptive provision from Sec. 560.5(a) of this part.
    (e) Within one day of a vote taken pursuant to this section, the 
Commission shall make publicly available a written copy of such vote 
reflecting the vote of each Commissioner.
    (f) In the case of the closure of a meeting or portions thereof, the 
Commission shall make publicly available within one day of the vote on 
such action a full written explanation of the reasons for the closing 
together with a list of all persons expected to attend the meeting and 
their affiliation.


<R05>
Sec. 560.7  Recordkeeping requirements.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the Commission 
shall maintain either a complete transcript or electronic recording of 
the proceedings of each meeting, whether opened or closed.
    (b) In the case of either a meeting or portions of a meeting closed 
to the public pursuant to Sec. 560.5(a) (8) or (10) of this part, the 
Commission shall maintain a complete transcript, an electronic 
recording, or a set of minutes of the proceedings. If minutes are 
maintained, they shall fully and clearly describe all matters discussed 
and shall provide a full and accurate summary of any actions taken and 
the reasons for which such actions were taken, including a description 
of the views expressed on any item and a record reflecting the vote of 
each Commissioner. All documents considered in connection with any 
action shall be identified in the minutes.
    (c) The transcript, electronic recording, or copy of the minutes 
shall disclose the identity of each speaker.
    (d) The Commission shall maintain a complete verbatim copy of the 
transcript, a complete electronic recording, or a complete copy of the 
minutes of the proceedings of each meeting for at least two years, or 
for one year after the conclusion of any Commission proceeding with 
respect to which the meeting was held, whichever occurs later.


<R05>
Sec. 560.8  Public availability of records.

    (a) The Commission shall make available to the public the 
transcript, electronic recording, or minutes of a meeting, except for 
items of discussion or testimony that relate to matters the Commission 
has determined to contain information which may be withheld under Sec. 
560.5 of this part.
    (b) The transcript, electronic recordings or minutes of a meeting 
shall be made available for public review as soon as practicable after 
each meeting at the Marine Mammal Commission, 1625 I Street NW., 
Washington, DC 20006.
    (c) Copies of the transcript, a transcription of the electronic 
recording, or the minutes of a meeting shall be furnished at cost to any
