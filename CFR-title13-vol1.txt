                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, January 1, 1999), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call (202) 523-4534.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication 
in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and 
parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.

[[Page vii]]

    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

Sec. 101.100  What is the purpose of SBA?

    The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) aids, counsels, 
assists, and protects the interests of small business concerns, and 
advocates on their behalf within the Government. It also helps victims 
of disasters. It provides financial assistance, contractual assistance, 
and business development assistance. For a more detailed description of 
the functions of SBA see The United States Government Manual, a special

disaster loan programs and have limited authority for program execution.
    (d) Disaster area offices. Disaster area offices are managed by Area 
Directors and are located in cities within defined geographical areas.

guarantee agreements, mortgages, and deeds of trust;
    (3) Other evidences of debt or security;

expressly provided otherwise.
    (c) To the extent feasible, SBA uses local or state procedures, 
especially for recordation and notification purposes, in implementing 
and facilitating SBA's loan programs. This use of local or state 
procedures is not a waiver by SBA of any Federal immunity from any local 
or state control, penalty, tax, or liability.
    (d) No person, corporation, or organization that applies for and 
receives any benefit or assistance from SBA, or that offers any

seq.), as amended. You may obtain approved forms for use by the public 
when applying for or obtaining SBA assistance, or when providing 
services for SBA, from any field office (see Sec. 101.103). You may also 
use forms which you have prepared yourself, or have obtained from

comments from state, area-wide, regional, or local officials and 
entities where there is no state process recommendation.
    (2) If a state process recommendation is transmitted by a single 
point of contact, all comments from state, area-wide, regional, and 
local officials and entities that differ from it must also be 
transmitted.

a state process recommendation, state, area-wide, regional, and local 
officials and entities may submit comments to SBA.
    (d) If a program or activity is not selected for a state process, 
state, area-wide, regional, and local officials and entities may submit 
comments to SBA. In addition, if a state process recommendation for a 
non-selected program or activity is transmitted to SBA by the single 
point of contact, the Administrator follows the procedures of 
Sec. 101.405.
    (e) The Administrator considers comments which do not constitute a 
state process recommendation submitted under this subpart and for which 
the Administrator is not required to apply the procedures of 
Sec. 101.405 when such comments are provided by a single point of 
contact directly to SBA by a commenting party.

[[Page 10]]


<R05>
Sec. 101.405  How does the Administrator respond to comments?

    (a) If a state process provides a recommendation to SBA through its 
single point of contact, the Administrator:
    (1) Accepts the recommendation; or
    (2) Reaches a mutually agreeable solution with the state process; or
    (3) Provides the single point of contact with a written explanation 
of the decision in a form the Administrator deems appropriate. The 
Administrator may also supplement the written explanation by telephone

U.S.C. 552).


<R05>
Sec. 102.2  How can I get records from SBA?

    (a) You can go to the SBA office at which the records are kept, and 
photocopy any final SBA decision, policy statement, or standard 
operating procedure.
    (b) For copies of all other records, you must send a letter request 
to the SBA office at which the records are kept. The letter must 
describe specific records you want. If you don't know which SBA office 
keeps the records, you may send your letter to the nearest SBA District 
Office. You may also send your letter to the Chief, FOIA & PA Office, 
409 Third Street SW., Suite 5900, Washington DC 20416. The office 
receiving your letter will forward it to the correct office.


<R05>
Sec. 102.3  How long will it take for SBA to respond to my request for records?

    (a) If you have met the fee requirements of Sec. 102.8, SBA will 
respond within 10 working days after the correct office receives your 
request, unless you have requested an especially large number of 
records, the records are not located in the office handling the request, 
or SBA needs to consult with another government office.
    (b) If you make your request on behalf of another person, SBA will 
respond within 10 working days after you present a document signed by 
that person authorizing you to request information on his or her behalf. 
If you make your request on behalf of another person without including 
such signed authorization, SBA will inform you of the authorization 
needed.
    (c) If you send your request to the wrong office, that office will 
send it to the correct office within 10 working days and will send you 
an acknowledgment letter.
    (d) If SBA determines that one of the circumstances described in 
paragraph (a) of this section apply, it will respond within 20 working 
days of the date upon which the correct office receives your request, 
and will notify you that the extra time is required.

[[Page 12]]


<R05>
Sec. 102.4  How will SBA respond to my request?

    Within the time limit described in Sec. 102.3, SBA will either:
    (a) Give you all the records you requested;
    (b) Give you some or none of the records you requested, explain why 
SBA has decided not to comply fully with your request, citing specific 
exemptions where applicable, and explain how to appeal that decision; or
    (c) Tell you that you will not receive a response until you have 
either paid your fee or committed to the amount of fee you will pay, as 
applicable.


<R05>
Sec. 102.5  If SBA grants my request, which records will be supplied?

    SBA will give you copies of all records or portions of records 
requested which are in the processing office as of the close of the day 
upon which that office received your request.


<R05>
Sec. 102.6  How will SBA respond to requests for business information?

    (a) Business information is a trade secret, or commercial or 
financial information, contained in records provided to SBA by any 
person and which may be protected from disclosure under Exemption Four 
of FOIA (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4)).
    (b) The submitter is the business entity to which the business 
information pertains and which submitted the information to SBA, either 
directly or through an intermediary, such as a bank.
    (c) SBA will disclose upon request business information that has 
previously been released to the general public.
    (d) If you request business information submitted to SBA prior to 
March 1, 1996 which has not previously been released to the general 
public, SBA will notify the submitter of your request upon SBA's receipt 
of it if SBA intends to release that information. SBA will give the 
submitter 5 working days to identify information the disclosure of which 
would likely cause substantial competitive harm and why that harm would 
occur unless SBA intends to deny your request in full.
    (e) If you request business information submitted to SBA after March 
1, 1996 which has not previously been released to the general public, 
SBA will notify the submitter if it intends to release business 
information which either the submitter has previously claimed or which 
SBA believes to be confidential and the disclosure of which would cause 
substantial competitive harm. The submitter will have 5 working days to 
object to the disclosure, explaining why the harm would occur.
    (f) Whenever a submitter objects to disclosure, SBA will consider 
the submitter's objections, but will not be bound by it. If SBA 
discloses information despite a submitter's objection, SBA will give the 
submitter the maximum notice possible before disclosure without 
violating the time constraints imposed by FOIA. In this notice, SBA will 
tell the submitter when and what it intends to disclose.
    (g) SBA will promptly notify the submitter of any suit filed against 
SBA to compel disclosure.


<R05>
Sec. 102.7  What are the procedures for submitters of business information to SBA after March 1, 1996?

    Submitters may identify business information at the time of 
submission which would likely cause them substantial competitive harm if 
disclosed. The identification shall lapse after 10 years, unless renewed 
in writing.


<R05>
Sec. 102.8  What fees will SBA charge?

    (a) Basic fees. (1) For manual record search. SBA will charge $18

    (2) For computer record searches. SBA will charge the actual costs.
    (3) For review and disclosure determinations. SBA will charge $18 
per hour.
    (4) Duplication. SBA will charge 10 cents per page for photocopy 
duplication, and the actual cost of reproduction for other methods.
    (5) Certifying records. SBA will charge actual costs.
    (6) For requested special types of delivery other than first-class 
mail. SBA may charge the actual cost.
    (b) If you are a representative of an educational institution, a 
non-commercial scientific institution, or a member of the news media. 
SBA will charge you only for the cost of duplication after the first 100 
pages.

[[Page 13]]

    (1) What is an educational institution? A state-certified preschool, 
elementary or secondary school, an accredited college or university, an 
accredited institution of professional education, or any accredited or 
state-certified institute of vocational education which operates a 
program or programs of scholarly research.
    (2) What is a non-commercial scientific institution? An organization 
which is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific 
research, the results of which are not intended to promote any 
particular product or industry.
    (3) What is a representative of an educational or non-commercial 
scientific institution? A requester seeking records on behalf of that 
institution who is authorized by that institution to do so, and who is 
seeking those records for scholarly or scientific reasons, as long as 
there is no commercial purpose to the request for records.
    (4) What is a representative of the news media? An individual who is 
actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to 
disseminate information to the general public. To be considered ``news 
media'', this organization may provide information by subscription and 
may target its dissemination to a narrow section of the general public 
as long as any member of the general public may purchase information 
from it. If you are not employed by the news media, but have a 
reasonable expectation that you will sell the information you obtain to 
the news media, SBA may conclude that you are a representative of the 
news media. SBA will not consider you to be a representative of the news 
media if your request has a commercial purpose, beyond the commercial 
purpose of selling information to the general public.
    (c) Member of the general public. If you are a member of the general 
public, SBA will not charge you for the first two hours of search time, 
the first hundred pages of photocopy duplication, or for review and 
disclosure determinations. The general public is anyone who is not a 
representative of an educational institution, a representative of the 
news media, or a commercial requester.
    (d) Commercial requester. If you are a commercial requester you must 
pay all the basic fees set forth in paragraph (a) of this section. A 
commercial requester is anyone seeking information for commercial, 
trade, or profit interests of the requester or someone he or she is 
trying to help.
    (e) How does SBA determine what category of requester I am? The SBA 
office processing your request will determine the appropriate category. 
If you are not a commercial requester, you must show us what category of 
requester you are.
    (f) Tell us how much you are willing to pay. To get the quickest 
possible response, you must tell SBA how much money you are willing to 
pay in fees when you make your request for records.
    (g) If you don't tell us how much you are willing to pay and SBA 
estimates that the fee will exceed $25.00, SBA will estimate the fee and 
will not process your request until you tell SBA that you are willing to 
pay the estimated amount, or until you narrow the request so that the 
fee is less than $25.
    (h) SBA will waive fees less than $25.
    (i) If the fee is more than $250, or if you have a history of 
failing to pay FOIA fees in a timely manner, SBA will ask you to remit 
the estimated amount and any past due charges before sending you the 
records.
    (j) Who determines the fee? The SBA office which processes your 
request.
    (k) When do you pay the fee? SBA will bill you when it responds to 
your request. You must pay within thirty-one calendar days.
    (l) Failure to pay fees. (1) If you do not pay by the thirty-first 
day after the billing date, SBA will charge interest at the maximum rate 
allowed under Title 31 of the United States Code, section 3717.
    (2) If you do not pay the amount due within ninety calendar days of 
the due date, SBA may notify consumer credit reporting agencies of your 
delinquency.
    (3) If you owe fees for previous FOIA responses, SBA will not 
respond to further requests unless you satisfy the amount due.
    (m) Unsuccessful searches. If SBA's search for records is 
unsuccessful, it will still bill you for the search.
    (n) Multiple requests. If you make multiple requests at or about the 
same

[[Page 14]]

    (o) Reduction of fees in the public interest. If SBA determines that 
disclosure of the information you seek is in the public interest because

the information in your own commercial interests, SBA may waive or 
reduce the fee.

under penalty of perjury, is normally sufficient evidence unless SBA has

<R05>
Sec. 103.1  Key definitions.

    (a) Agent means an authorized representative, including an attorney, 
accountant, consultant, packager, lender service provider, or any other 
person representing an applicant or participant by conducting business 
with SBA.
    (b) The term conduct business with SBA means:
    (1) Preparing or submitting on behalf of an applicant an application 
for financial assistance of any kind, assistance from the Investment 
Division of SBA, or assistance in procurement and technical matters;

[[Page 22]]

    (2) Preparing or processing on behalf of a lender or a participant 
in any of SBA's programs an application for federal financial 
assistance;
    (3) Participating with or communicating in any way with officers or 
employees of SBA on an applicant's, participant's, or lender's behalf;
    (4) Acting as a lender service provider; and
    (5) Such other activity as SBA reasonably shall determine.
    (c) Applicant means any person, firm, concern, corporation, 
partnership, cooperative or other business enterprise applying for any 
type of assistance from SBA.
    (d) Lender Service Provider means an Agent who carries out lender 
functions in originating, disbursing, servicing, or liquidating a 
specific SBA business loan or loan portfolio for compensation from the 
lender. SBA determines whether or not one is a ``Lender Service 
Provider'' on a loan-by-loan basis.
    (e) Packager means an Agent who is employed and compensated by an 
Applicant or lender to prepare the Applicant's application for financial 
assistance from SBA. SBA determines whether or not one is a ``Packager'' 
on a loan-by-loan basis.
    (f) Referral Agent means a person or entity who identifies and 
refers an Applicant to a lender or a lender to an Applicant. The 
Referral Agent may be employed and compensated by either an Applicant or 
a lender.
    (g) Participant means a person or entity that is participating in 
any of the financial, investment, or business development programs 
authorized by the Small Business Act or Small Business Investment Act of 
1958.


<R05>
Sec. 103.2  Who may conduct business with SBA?

    (a) If you are an Applicant, a Participant, a partner of an 
Applicant or Participant partnership, or serve as an officer of an 
Applicant, Participant corporation, or limited liability company, you 
may conduct business with SBA without a representative.
    (b) If you are an Agent, you may conduct business with SBA on behalf 
of an Applicant, Participant or lender, unless representation is 
otherwise prohibited by law or the regulations in this part or any other 
part in this chapter. For example, persons debarred under the SBA or 
Government-wide debarment regulations may not conduct business with SBA. 
SBA may request that any Agent supply written evidence of his or her 
authority to act on behalf of an Applicant, Participant, or lender as a 
condition of revealing any information about the Applicant's, 
Participant's, or lender's current or prior dealings with SBA.


<R05>
Sec. 103.3  May SBA suspend or revoke an Agent's privilege?

    The Administrator of SBA or designee may, for good cause, suspend or 
revoke the privilege of any Agent to conduct business with SBA. Part 134 
of this chapter states the procedures for appealing the decision to 
suspend or revoke the privilege. The suspension or revocation remains in 
effect during the pendency of any administrative proceedings under part 
134 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 103.4  What is ``good cause'' for suspension or revocation?

    Any unlawful or unethical activity is good cause for suspension or 
revocation of the privilege to conduct business. This includes:
    (a) Attempting to influence any employee of SBA or a lender, by 
gifts, bribes or other unlawful or unethical activity, with respect to 
any matter involving SBA assistance.
    (b) Soliciting for the provision of services to an Applicant by 
another entity when there is an undisclosed business relationship 
between the two parties.
    (c) Violating ethical guidelines which govern the profession or 
business of the Agent or which are published at any time by SBA.
    (d) Implying or stating that the work to be performed for an 
Applicant will include use of political or other special influence with 
SBA. Examples include indicating that the entity is affiliated with or 
paid, endorsed or employed by SBA, advertising using the words Small 
Business Administration or SBA in a manner that implies SBA's 
endorsement or sponsorship, use of SBA's seal or symbol, and giving a 
``guaranty'' to an Applicant that the application will be approved.

[[Page 23]]

    (e) Charging or proposing to charge any fee that does not bear a 
necessary and reasonable relationship to the services actually rendered 
or expenses actually incurred in connection with a matter before SBA or 
which is materially inconsistent with the provisions of an applicable 
compensation agreement or Lender Service Provider agreement. A fee based 
solely on a percentage of a loan or guarantee amount can be reasonable, 
depending on the circumstances of a case and the services actually 
rendered.
    (f) Engaging in any conduct indicating a lack of business integrity 
or business honesty, including debarment, criminal conviction, or civil 
judgment within the last seven years for fraud, embezzlement, theft, 
forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, false 
statements, conspiracy, receiving stolen property, false claims, or 
obstruction of justice.
    (g) Acting as both a Lender Service Provider or Referral Agent and a 
Packager for an Applicant on the same SBA business loan and receiving 
compensation for such activity from both the Applicant and lender. A 
limited exception to this ``two master'' prohibition exists when an 
Agent acts as a Packager and is compensated by the Applicant for 
packaging services; also acts as a Referral Agent and is compensated by 
the lender for those activities; discloses the referral activities to 
the Applicant; and discloses the packaging activities to the lender.
    (h) Violating materially the terms of any compensation agreement or 
Lender Service Provider agreement provided for in Sec. 103.5.
    (i) Violating or assisting in the violation of any SBA regulations, 
policies, or procedures of which the Applicant has been made aware.


<R05>
Sec. 103.5  How does SBA regulate an Agent's fees and provision of service?

    (a) Any Applicant, Agent, or Packager must execute and provide to 
SBA a compensation agreement, and any Lender Service Provider must 
execute and provide to SBA a Lender Service Provider agreement. Each 
agreement governs the compensation charged for services rendered or to 
be rendered to the Applicant or lender in any matter involving SBA 
assistance. SBA provides the form of compensation agreement and a 
suggested form of Lender Service Provider agreement to be used by 
Agents.
    (b) Compensation agreements must provide that in cases where SBA 
deems the compensation unreasonable, the Agent or Packager must: reduce 
the charge to an amount SBA deems reasonable, refund any sum in excess 
of the amount SBA deems reasonable to the Applicant, and refrain from 
charging or collecting, directly or indirectly, from the Applicant an 
amount in excess of the amount SBA deems reasonable.
    (c) Each Lender Service Provider must enter into a written agreement 
with each lender for whom it acts in that capacity. SBA will review all 
such agreements. Such agreements need not contain each and every 
provision found in the SBA's suggested form of agreement. However, each 
agreement must indicate that both parties agree not to engage in any 
sharing of secondary market premiums, that the services to be provided 
are accurately described, and that the agreement is otherwise consistent 
with SBA requirements. Subject to the prohibition on splitting premiums, 
lenders have reasonable discretion in setting compensation for Lender 
Service Providers. However, such compensation may not be directly 
charged to an Applicant or borrower.

<R05>
Sec. 107.130  Requirement for qualified management.

    When applying for a license, you must show, to the satisfaction of 
SBA, that your current or proposed management is qualified and has the 
knowledge, experience, and capability necessary for investing in the 
types of businesses contemplated by the Act, these regulations and your 
business plan. You must designate at least one individual as the 
official responsible for contact with SBA.


<R05>
Sec. 107.140  SBA approval of initial Management Expenses.

<R05>
Sec. 107.150  Management and ownership diversity requirement.

    You must have diversity between management and ownership in order to 
be licensed, unless you do not plan to obtain Leverage. To establish 
diversity, you must meet the requirements in paragraphs (a) and (b) of 
this section unless SBA approves otherwise.
    (a) Requirement one. You must satisfy either paragraph (a)(1) or 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

[[Page 37]]

    (1) At least 30 percent of your Regulatory Capital and Leverageable 
Capital must be owned by Persons unrelated to management. To satisfy 
this requirement, such Persons must not be your Associates (except for 
their status as your shareholders or limited partners) and must not 
Control, be Controlled by, or be under Common Control with any of your 
Associates. You must have as investors at least three such Persons who 
are not Affiliates of one another and whose investments are significant 
in both dollar and percentage terms, as determined by SBA. As an 
alternative, you may substitute one investor who is an acceptable 
Institutional Investor for the three investors who are otherwise 
required. For purposes of this paragraph (a)(1), the following 
Institutional Investors are acceptable:
    (i) Entities regulated by state or Federal authorities satisfactory 
to SBA;
    (ii) Public or private employee pension funds;
    (iii) Trusts, foundations, or endowments which are exempt from 
Federal income taxation; or
    (iv) Other Institutional Investors satisfactory to SBA.
    (2) Your common stock or limited partnership interests are publicly 
traded.
    (b) Requirement two. Your shareholders or limited partners may not 
delegate their voting rights to any other Person without prior SBA 
approval. This restriction does not apply to:
    (1) Publicly traded Licensees.
    (2) Proxies given to vote at single specified meetings.
    (3) Delegations of voting rights by your investors to their 
investment advisors, provided such advisors are not your Associates 
(except for their status as your shareholder or partner).
    (c) Diversity based on Licensee's parent company. If you do not have 
diversity as defined in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, SBA in 
its sole discretion may accept diversity achieved on the same basis 
through your parent company as a substitute. As used in this paragraph 
(c), ``parent company'' means an entity that directly or indirectly has 
an interest of more than 50 percent of your Regulatory Capital.
    (d) Requirement to maintain diversity after licensing. If you were 
required to have diversity between management and ownership at the time 
you were licensed, you must maintain such diversity while you have 
outstanding Leverage or Earmarked Assets, unless SBA approves otherwise. 
If, at any time, you no longer satisfy the diversity criteria in 
paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, you must:
    (1) Notify SBA within 10 days; and
    (2) Re-establish diversity within six months.
    (e) Exception to diversity rule. This Sec. 107.150 does not apply if 
you are not licensed to issue participating securities and:
    (1) You received your license before November 28, 1995; or
    (2) SBA received your license application before November 28, 1995 
and, as of such date, you had raised the funds needed to begin 
operations as contemplated in your business plan.

Sec. 107.160  Special rules for Licensees formed as limited partnerships.

    A limited partnership organized under State law solely for the

contemplated under the Act may apply for a license under section 301(c) 
or section 301 (d) of the Act (``Partnership Licensee'').

Licensee, you must have as your general partner(s) at least two 
individuals, or at least one corporation, partnership, or limited 
liability company (LLC), or any combination of individuals, 
corporations, partnerships, or LLCs.
    (b) Entity General Partner of Licensee. A general partner which is a 
corporation, limited liability company or partnership (an ``Entity 
General Partner'') shall be organized under state law solely for the 
purpose of serving as the general partner of one or more Licensees.
    (1) SBA must approve any person who will serve as an officer, 
director, manager, or general partner of the Entity General Partner.

[[Page 38]]

member agreement, Limited Partnership Agreement or other similar 
governing instrument which must, in each case, accompany the license 
application.
    (2) An Entity General Partner is subject to the same examination and 
reporting requirements as a Licensee under section 310(b) of the Act. 
The restrictions and obligations imposed upon a Licensee by 
Secs. 107.1800 through 107.1820, and 107.30, 107.410 through 107.450, 
107.470, 107.475, 107.500, 107.510, 107.585, 107.600, 107.680, 107.690 
through 107.692, 107.865, and 107.1910 apply also to an Entity General 
Partner of a Licensee.
    (3) The general partner(s) of your Entity General Partner(s) will be 
considered your general partner.
    (4) If your Entity General Partner is a limited partnership, its 
limited partners may be considered your Control Person(s) if they meet 
the definition for Control Person in Sec. 107.50.
    (5) If your Entity General Partner is a limited partnership, it is 
subject to paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Other requirements for Partnership Licensees. If you are a 
Partnership Licensee:
    (1) You must have a minimum duration of ten years or two years 
following the maturity of your last-maturing Leverage security, 
whichever is longer. After 10 years, if all Leverage has been repaid or 
redeemed and all amounts due SBA, its agent, or Trustee have been paid, 
the Partnership Licensee may be terminated by a vote of your partners. 
(For purposes of this provision SBA is not considered a partner.);
    (2) None of your general partner(s) may be removed or replaced by 
your limited partners without prior written approval of SBA;
    (3) Any transferee of, or successor in interest to, your general 
partner shall have only the rights and liabilities of a limited partner 
pending SBA's written approval of such transfer or succession; and
    (4) You must incorporate all the provisions in this paragraph (c) in 
your Limited Partnership Agreement.
    (d) Obligations of a Control Person. All Control Persons are bound 
by the disciplinary provisions of sections 313 and 314 of the Act and by 
the conflict-of-interest rules under section 312 of the Act. The term 
Licensee, as used in Secs. 107.30, 107.460, and 107.680 includes all of 
the Licensee's Control Persons. The term Licensee as used in 
Sec. 107.670 includes only the Licensee's general partner(s). The 
conditions specified in Secs. 107.1800 through 107.1820 and 
Sec. 107.1910 apply to all general partners.
    (e) Liability of general partner for partnership debts to SBA. 
Subject to section 314 of the Act, your general partner is not liable 
solely by reason of its status as a general partner for repayment of any 
Leverage or debts you owe to SBA unless SBA, in the exercise of 
reasonable investment prudence, and with regard to your financial 
soundness, determines otherwise prior to the purchase or guaranty of 
your Leverage.
    (f) Reorganization of Licensee. A corporate Licensee wishing to 
reorganize as a Partnership Licensee, or a Partnership Licensee wishing 
to reorganize as a Corporate Licensee, may apply to SBA for approval 
under Sec. 107.470.
    (g) Special Leverage requirement. Before your first issuance of 
Leverage, you must furnish SBA with evidence that you qualify as a

    (e) You may not accept any capital contribution made with funds 
borrowed by a Person seeking to own an equity interest (whether direct 
or indirect, beneficial or of record) of at least 10 percent of your 
Private Capital. This exclusion does not apply if:

    (2) The shares pledged are at least 10 percent of your Regulatory 
Capital.
    (b) If the transaction creates a change of ownership or Control, you 
must comply with Sec. 107.400 or Sec. 107.410, as appropriate.

Sec. 107.530  Restrictions on investments of idle funds by leveraged Licensees.

    (a) Applicability of this section. This Sec. 107.530 applies if you

and interest by, the United States, which mature within 15 months from

regulations of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as amended (12 
CFR 325.103).
    (2) Exception: You may make a temporary deposit (not to exceed 30 
days) in excess of the insured amount, in a transfer account established 
to facilitate the receipt and disbursement of funds or to hold funds 
necessary to honor Commitments issued.
    (d) Deposit of funds in Associate institution. A deposit in, or a 
repurchase agreement with, a federally insured institution that is your 
Associate is not considered a Financing of such Associate under 
Sec. 107.730, provided the terms of such deposit or repurchase agreement 
are no less favorable than those available to the general public.

               Borrowing by Licensees From Non-SBA Sources


<R05>
Sec. 107.550  Prior approval of secured third-party debt of leveraged Licensees.

    (a) Definition. In this Sec. 107.550, ``secured third-party debt'' 
means any non-SBA debt secured by any of your assets, including secured 
guarantees and other contingent obligations that you voluntarily assume, 
secured lines of credit, and secured Temporary Debt of a Licensee with 
outstanding Participating Securities.
    (b) General rule. If you have outstanding Leverage, you must get 
SBA's written approval before you incur any secured third-party debt or 
refinance any debt with secured third-party debt, including any renewal 
of a secured line of credit, increase in the maximum amount available 
under a secured line

[[Page 45]]

of credit, or expansion of the scope of a security interest or lien. For 
purposes of this paragraph (b), ``expansion of the scope of a security 
interest or lien'' does not include the substitution of one asset or 
group of assets for another, provided the asset values (as reported on 
your most recent annual Form 468) are comparable.
    (c) Additional rule for secured lines of credit in existence on 
April 8, 1994. If you have outstanding Leverage and you have a secured 
line of credit that was created on or before April 8, 1994, you must 
receive SBA's written approval of the line before you increase the 
amounts outstanding thereunder.
    (d) Conditions for SBA approval. As a condition of granting its 
approval under this Sec. 107.550, SBA may impose such restrictions or 
limitations as it deems appropriate, taking into account your historical 
performance, current financial position, proposed terms of the secured 
debt and amount of aggregate debt you will have outstanding (including 
Leverage). SBA will not favorably consider any requests for approval 
which include a blanket lien on all your assets, or a security interest 
in your investor commitments in excess of 125 percent of the proposed 
borrowing.
    (e) Thirty day approval. Unless SBA notifies you otherwise within 30 
days after it receives your request, you may consider your request 
automatically approved if:
    (1) You are in regulatory compliance;
    (2) The security interest in your assets is limited to either those 
assets being acquired with the borrowed funds or an asset coverage ratio 
of no more than 2:1;
    (3) Your Leverage does not exceed 150 percent of your Leverageable 
Capital; and
    (4) Your request is for approval of a secured line of credit that 
would not cause your total outstanding borrowings (not including 
Leverage) to exceed 50 percent of your Leverageable Capital.


<R05>
Sec. 107.560  Subordination of SBA's creditor position.

    (a) Debentures purchased or guaranteed on or before July 1, 1991. 
Under the terms of any Debenture purchased or guaranteed by SBA on or 
before July 1, 1991, SBA's unsecured claims against you, as a Debenture-
holder or as subrogee, are subordinated in favor of all your other 
creditors, except to the extent that such claims may be subject to 
equitable subordination in SBA's favor.
    (b) Debentures purchased or guaranteed after July 1, 1991, including 
refinancings of Debentures previously purchased or guaranteed. (1) Under 
the terms of any Debenture purchased or guaranteed by SBA after July 1, 
1991, SBA's unsecured claims against you, as a Debenture-holder or as 
subrogee, are subordinated only in favor of non-Associate lenders; and, 
to the extent that your indebtedness to such lenders exceeds the lesser 
of $10,000,000 or 200 percent of your Regulatory Capital (determined as 
of the date your Debentures were purchased or guaranteed), SBA's 
unsecured claims enjoy parity with those of other unsecured creditors, 
except with respect to indebtedness created on or before July 1, 1991.
    (2) In order to induce others to lend you money after your Debenture 
has been purchased or guaranteed, SBA may agree in writing on a case-by-
case basis to subordinate its unsecured claims, on such terms as it may 
determine, in favor of one or more of your Associates, or in favor of 
other lenders in excess of the amounts mentioned in paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section.
    (3) SBA reserves the authority to refuse to subordinate its claims 
if it determines, at the time you request your Debenture be purchased or 
guaranteed, that the exercise of reasonable investment prudence and your 
financial condition warrant such refusal.


<R05>
Sec. 107.570  Restrictions on third-party debt of issuers of Participating Securities.

    (a) General. Temporary Debt is the only debt (other than Leverage) 
that you are permitted to incur if you have applied to issue 
Participating Securities or if you have outstanding Participating 
Securities. For additional rules governing secured Temporary Debt, see 
Sec. 107.550.
    (b) Definition of Temporary Debt. Temporary Debt means your short-
term borrowings if:

[[Page 46]]

    (1) Such borrowings are for the purpose of maintaining your 
operating liquidity or providing funds for a particular Financing of a 
Small Business;
    (2) The funds are borrowed from a regulated financial institution or 
a regulated credit company (or, if approved by SBA on a case-by-case 
basis, from non-regulated lenders including shareholders or partners);
    (3) Your total outstanding borrowings (not including Leverage) do 
not exceed 50 percent of your Leverageable Capital; and
    (4) All such borrowings are fully paid off for at least 30 
consecutive days during your fiscal year so that you have no outstanding 
third-party debt for 30 days.

           Voluntary Decrease in Licensee's Regulatory Capital


<R05>
Sec. 107.585  Voluntary decrease in Licensee's Regulatory Capital.

    You must obtain SBA's prior written approval to reduce your 
Regulatory Capital by more than two percent in any fiscal year, unless 
otherwise permitted under Secs. 107.1560 and 107.1570. At all times, you 
must retain sufficient Regulatory Capital to meet the minimum capital 
requirements in the Act and Sec. 107.210, and sufficient Leverageable 
Capital to avoid having excess Leverage in violation of section 303 of 
the Act and Secs. 107.1150 through 107.1170.

           Requirement To Conduct Active Investment Operations


<R05>
Sec. 107.590  Licensee's requirement to maintain active operations.

    (a) Activity test. You must conduct active operations, as determined 
under this Sec. 107.590, as a condition of your license. You will be 
considered active if:
    (1) During the eighteen months preceding your most recent fiscal 
year end, you made Financings totaling at least 20 percent of your 
Regulatory Capital; or
    (2) Your idle funds did not exceed 20 percent of your total assets 
(at cost) at your most recent fiscal year end.
    (b) Permitted exceptions to activity requirements. You are 
considered active if your failure to meet the requirements in paragraph 
(a) of this section is the result of one or more of the following 
factors:
    (1) Your excess idle funds are the result of the receipt, within the 
previous nine months, of realized gains, repayments, additional capital 
contributions, or Leverage.
    (2) It is necessary for you to maintain excess idle funds to conduct 
your operations because:
    (i) Your unfunded commitments from investors are no more than 20 
percent of your Regulatory Capital; and
    (ii) You cannot receive additional Leverage, solely because SBA has 
insufficient funds available.
    (3) You have not made sufficient Financings because of a lack of 
available funds, evidenced by Loans and Investments (at cost) equal to 
at least 90 percent of your Combined Capital as of your most recent 
fiscal year end.
    (4) You have not made sufficient Financings solely because SBA has 
restricted your ability to make investments.
    (c) Applicability of activity requirements. The activity 
requirements in paragraph (a) of this section do not apply if you have 
filed a ``Wind-up Plan'' approved by SBA. ``Wind-up Plan'' means a plan 
that you prepare when you decide that you will no longer make any 
Financings other than follow-on investments, and that you update 
annually when you file your SBA Form 468. The plan must contain your 
best estimates of the following:
    (1) The remaining number of years you expect to operate.
    (2) For each of your Loans and Investments, the expected liquidation 
date and anticipated proceeds.
    (3) The timing of your repayment of obligations to SBA.
    (4) The timing and amount of any planned reductions in your 
Management Expenses.
    (d) Phase-in of activity requirements. (1) General rule. You must 
meet the activity requirements in this Sec. 107.590 as of the end of 
your first full fiscal year beginning after January 31, 1996. Until 
then, you will be considered active if you meet the activity 
requirements in effect on January 30, 1996.
    (2) Rule for new Licensees. If you received your license after 
January 31,

[[Page 47]]

1996, or if you received your license less than eighteen months before 
the fiscal year end determined under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, 
you must meet the activity requirements in this Sec. 107.590 as of the 
end of your second full fiscal year beginning after the date you 
received your license.

    All the information required by this section is subject to the

<R04>
          Subpart G--Financing of Small Businesses by Licensees

   Determining the Eligibility of a Small Business for SBIC Financing


<R05>
Sec. 107.700  Compliance with size standards in Part 121 of this chapter as a condition of Assistance.

    You are permitted to provide financial assistance and management 
services only to a Small Business. To determine whether an applicant is 
a Small Business, you may use either the financial size standards in 
Sec. 121.301(c)(1) of this chapter or the industry standard covering the 
industry in which the applicant is primarily engaged, as set forth in 
Sec. 121.301(c)(2) of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 107.710  Requirement to Finance Smaller Enterprises.

    Your Portfolio must include Financings to Smaller Enterprises.
    (a) Definition of Smaller Enterprise. A Smaller Enterprise means any 
small business concern that:
    (1) Together with its Affiliates has a net worth of not more than 
$6.0 million and average net income after Federal income taxes 
(excluding any carry-over losses) for the preceding two years no greater 
than $2.0 million; or
    (2) Both together with its Affiliates, and by itself, meets the size 
standard of Sec. 121.201 of this chapter at the time of Financing for 
the industry in which it is then primarily engaged.
    (b) Smaller Enterprise Financings.--(1) General rule. At the close 
of each of your fiscal years, at least 20 percent of the total dollar 
amount of the Financings you extended since April 25, 1994 must have 
been invested in Smaller Enterprises. If you were licensed after April 
25, 1994, the 20 percent requirement applies to the total dollar amount 
of the Financings you extended since you were licensed plus any pre-
licensing investments approved by SBA for inclusion in your Regulatory 
Capital.
    (2) Phase-in for new Licensees. At the close of your first full 
fiscal year after licensing, at least 10 percent of the total dollar 
amount of the Financings you extended, including any pre-licensing 
investments approved by SBA for inclusion in your Regulatory Capital, 
must have been invested in Smaller Enterprises. At the close of each 
fiscal year thereafter, you must meet the requirement in paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section.
    (c) Special requirement for certain leveraged Licensees.--(1) This 
paragraph (c) applies if you were licensed on or before September 30, 
1996, and you issued Leverage after that date, and you have Regulatory 
Capital of:

[[Page 52]]

    (i) Less than $10,000,000 if such Leverage was Participating 
Securities; or
    (ii) Less than $5,000,000 if such Leverage was Debentures.
    (2) At the close of each of your fiscal years, at least 50 percent 
of the total dollar amount of the Financings you extended after 
September 30, 1996 must have been invested in Smaller Enterprises.
    (d) Financing a change of ownership which results in the creation of 
a Smaller Enterprises. The Financing of a change of ownership under 
Sec. 107.750 which results in the creation of a Smaller Enterprise 
qualifies as a Smaller Enterprise Financing.
    (e) Non-compliance with this section. If you have not reached the 
required percentage of Smaller Enterprise Financings at the end of any 
fiscal year, then you must be in compliance by the end of the following 
fiscal year. However, you will not be eligible for additional Leverage 
until you reach the required percentage (see Sec. 107.1120(c) and (d)).

[62 FR 11760, Mar. 13, 1997, as amended at 63 FR 5866, Feb. 5, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 107.720  Small Businesses that may be ineligible for Financing.

    (a) Relenders or reinvestors. You are not permitted to finance any 
business that is a relender or reinvestor.
    (1) Definition. Relenders or reinvestors are businesses whose 
primary business activity involves, directly or indirectly, providing 
funds to others, purchasing debt obligations, factoring, or long-term 
leasing of equipment with no provision for maintenance or repair.
    (2) Exception. You may provide Venture Capital Financing to 
Disadvantaged Businesses that are relenders or reinvestors (except banks 
or savings and loans not insured by agencies of the federal government, 
and agricultural credit companies). Without SBA's prior written 
approval, total Financings under this paragraph (a)(2) that are 
outstanding as of the close of your fiscal year must not exceed your 
Regulatory Capital.
    (b) Passive Businesses. You are not permitted to finance a passive 
business.
    (1) Definition. A business is passive if:
    (i) It is not engaged in a regular and continuous business operation 
(for purposes of this paragraph (b), the mere receipt of payments such 
as dividends, rents, lease payments, or royalties is not considered a 
regular and continuous business operation); or
    (ii) Its employees are not carrying on the majority of day to day 
operations, and the company does not provide effective control and 
supervision, on a day to day basis, over persons employed under 
contract; or
    (iii) It passes through substantially all of the proceeds of the 
Financing to another entity.
    (2) Exception for pass-through of proceeds to subsidiary. You may 
finance a passive business if it is a Small Business and it passes 
substantially all the proceeds through to one or more subsidiary 
companies, each of which is an eligible Small Business that is not 
passive. For the purpose of this paragraph (b)(2), ``subsidiary 
company'' means a company in which at least 50 percent of the 
outstanding voting securities are owned by the Financed passive 
business.
    (3) Exception for certain Partnership Licensees. With the prior 
written approval of SBA, if you are a Partnership Licensee, you may form 
one or more wholly-owned corporations in accordance with this paragraph 
(b)(3). The sole purpose of such corporation(s) must be to provide 
Financing to one or more eligible, unincorporated Small Businesses. You 
may form such corporation(s) only if a direct Financing to such Small 
Businesses would cause any of your investors to incur unrelated business 
taxable income under section 511 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 
as amended (26 U.S.C. 511). Your ownership of such corporation(s) will 
not constitute a violation of Sec. 107.865(a) and your investment of 
funds in such corporation(s) will not constitute a violation of 
Sec. 107.730(a).
    (c) Real Estate Businesses. (1) You are not permitted to finance any 
business classified under Major Group 65 (Real Estate) or Industry No. 
1531 (Operative Builders) of the SIC Manual, with the following 
exceptions:
    (i) Title Abstract companies (Industry No. 6541); and

[[Page 53]]

    (ii) Companies listed under Industry No. 6531 (for example, real 
estate agents, brokers, escrow agents, managers and multiple listing 
services) that derive at least 80 percent of their revenue from non-
Affiliate sources.
    (2) You are not permitted to finance a business, regardless of SIC 
classification, if the Financing is to be used to acquire realty or to 
discharge an obligation relating to the prior acquisition of realty, 
unless the Small Business:
    (i) Is acquiring an existing property and will use at least 51 
percent of the usable square footage for an eligible business purpose; 
or
    (ii) Is building or renovating a building and will use at least 67 
percent of the usable square footage for an eligible business purpose.
    (d) Project Financing. You are not permitted to finance a business 
if:
    (1) The assets of the business are to be reduced or consumed, 
generally without replacement, as the life of the business progresses, 
and the nature of the business requires that a stream of cash payments 
be made to the business's financing sources, on a basis associated with 
the continuing sale of assets. Examples include real estate development 
projects and oil and gas wells; or
    (2) The primary purpose of the Financing is to fund production of a 
single item or defined limited number of items, generally over a defined 
production period, and such production will constitute the majority of 
the activities of the Small Business. Examples include motion pictures 
and electric generating plants.
    (e) Farm land purchases. You are not permitted to finance the 
acquisition of farm land. Farm land means land which is or is intended 
to be used for agricultural or forestry purposes, such as the production 
of food, fiber, or wood, or is so taxed or zoned.
    (f) Public interest. You are not permitted to finance any business 
if the proceeds are to be used for purposes contrary to the public 
interest, including but not limited to activities which are in violation 
of law, or inconsistent with free competitive enterprise.
    (g) Foreign investment--(1) General rule. You are not permitted to 
finance a business if:
    (i) The funds will be used substantially for a foreign operation; or
    (ii) At the time of the Financing or within one year thereafter, 
more than 49 percent of the employees or tangible assets of the Small 
Business are located outside the United States (unless you can show, to 
SBA's satisfaction, that the Financing was used for a specific domestic 
purpose).
    (2) Exception. This paragraph (g) does not prohibit a Financing used 
to acquire foreign materials and equipment or foreign property rights 
for use or sale in the United States.
    (h) Associated supplier. You are not permitted to finance a business 
that purchases, or will purchase, goods or services from a supplier who 
is your Associate, except under the following conditions:
    (1) The amount of goods and services purchased (or to be purchased) 
from your Associate with the proceeds of the Financing, or with funds 
released as a result of the Financing, is less than 50 percent of the 
total amount of the Financing (75 percent for a Section 301(d) 
Licensee);
    (2) The price of such goods and services is no higher than that 
charged other customers of your Associate; and
    (3) The Small Business purchases no capital goods from your 
Associate.
    (i) Financing Licensees. You are not permitted to provide funds, 
directly or indirectly, that the Small Business will use:
    (1) To purchase stock in or provide capital to a Licensee; or
    (2) To repay an indebtedness incurred for the purpose of investing 
in a Licensee.

[61 FR 3189, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 63 FR 5867, Feb. 5, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 107.730  Financings which constitute conflicts of interest.

    (a) General rule. You must not self-deal to the prejudice of a Small 
Business, the Licensee, its shareholders or partners, or SBA. Unless you 
obtain a prior written exemption from SBA for special instances in which 
a Financing may further the purposes of the Act despite presenting a 
conflict of interest, you must not directly or indirectly:
    (1) Provide Financing to any of your Associates.

[[Page 54]]

    (2) Provide Financing to an Associate of another Licensee if one of 
your Associates has received or will receive any direct or indirect 
Financing or a Commitment from that Licensee or a third Licensee 
(including Financing or Commitments received under any understanding, 
agreement, or cross dealing, reciprocal or circular arrangement).
    (3) Borrow money from:
    (i) A Small Business Financed by you;
    (ii) An officer, director, or owner of at least a 10 percent equity 
interest in such business; or
    (iii) A Close Relative of any such officer, director, or equity 
owner.
    (4) Provide Financing to a Small Business to discharge an obligation 
to your Associate or free other funds to pay such obligation. This 
paragraph (a)(4) does not apply if the obligation is to an Associate 
Lending Institution and is a line of credit or other obligation incurred 
in the normal course of business.
    (5) Provide Financing to a Small Business for the purpose of 
purchasing property from your Associate, except as permitted under 
Sec. 107.720(h).
    (b) Rules applicable to Associates. Without SBA' s prior written 
approval, your Associates must not, directly or indirectly:
    (1) Borrow money from any Person described in paragraph (a)(3) of 
this section.
    (2) Receive from a Small Business any compensation in connection 
with Assistance you provide (except as permitted under Secs. 107.825(c) 
and 107.900), or anything of value for procuring, attempting to procure, 
or influencing your action with respect to such Assistance.
    (c) Applicability of other laws. You are also bound by any 
restrictions in Federal or State laws governing conflicts of interest 
and fiduciary obligations.
    (d) Financings with Associates--(1) Financings with Associates 
requiring prior approval. Without SBA's prior written approval, you may 
not Finance any business in which your Associate has either a voting 
equity interest, or total equity interests (including potential 
interests), of at least five percent.
    (2) Other Financings with Associates. If you and an Associate 
provide Financing to the same Small Business, either at the same time or 
at different times, you must be able to demonstrate to SBA's 
satisfaction that the terms and conditions are (or were) fair and 
equitable to you, taking into account any differences in the timing of 
each party's financing transactions.
    (3) Exceptions to paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section. A 
Financing that falls into one of the following categories is exempt from 
the prior approval requirement in paragraph (d)(1) of this section or is 
presumed to be fair and equitable to you for the purposes of paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section, as appropriate:
    (i) Your Associate is a Lending Institution that is providing 
financing under a credit facility in order to meet the operational needs 
of the Small Business, and the terms of such financing are usual and 
customary.
    (ii) Your Associate invests in the Small Business on the same terms 
and conditions and at the same time as you.
    (iii) Both you and your Associate are leveraged Licensees, and both 
have outstanding Participating Securities or neither has outstanding 
Participating Securities.
    (iv) Both you and your Associate are non-leveraged Licensees, or you 
are a non-leveraged Licensee and your Associate is not a Licensee.
    (e) Use of Associates to manage Portfolio Concerns. To protect your 
investment, you may designate an Associate to serve as an officer, 
director, or other participant in the management of a Small Business. 
You must identify any such Associate in your records available for SBA's 
review under Sec. 107.600. Without SBA's prior written approval, the 
Associate must not:
    (1) Have any other direct or indirect financial interest in the 
Portfolio Concern that exceeds, or has the potential to exceed, 5 
percent of the Portfolio Concern's equity.
    (2) Have served for more than 30 days as an officer, director or 
other participant in the management of the Portfolio Concern before you 
provided Financing.

[[Page 55]]

    (3) Receive any income or anything of value from the Portfolio 
Concern unless it is for your benefit, with the exception of director's 
fees, expenses, and distributions based upon the Associate's ownership 
interest in the Concern.
    (f) 1940 and 1980 Act Companies: SEC exemptions. If you are a 1940 
or 1980 Act Company and you receive an exemption from the Securities and 
Exchange Commission for a transaction described in this Sec. 107.730, 
you need not obtain SBA's approval of the transaction. However, you must 
promptly notify SBA of the transaction and satisfy the public notice 
requirements in paragraph (g) of this section.
    (g) Public notice. Before SBA grants an exemption under this 
Sec. 107.730, you must publish notice of the transaction in a newspaper 
of general circulation in the locality most directly affected by the 
transaction, and furnish a certified copy to SBA within 10 days of 
publication. SBA will publish a similar notice in the Federal Register.

Sec. 107.740  Portfolio diversification (``overline'' limitation).

    (a) General rule. This Sec. 107.740 applies if you have outstanding 
Leverage or want to be eligible for Leverage. Without SBA's prior 
written approval, you may provide Financing or a Commitment to a Small 
Business only if the resulting amount of your aggregate outstanding 
Financings and Commitments to such Small Business and its Affiliates 
does not exceed:
    (1) 20 percent of your Regulatory Capital as of the date of the 
Financing or Commitment if you are a Section 301(c) Licensee; or
    (2) 30 percent of your Regulatory Capital as of the date of the 
Financing or Commitment if you are a Section 301(d) Licensee.
    (b) Outstanding Financings. For the purposes of paragraph (a) of 
this section, you must measure each outstanding Financing at its current 
cost plus any amount of the Financing that was previously written off.
    (c) Adjustment to Regulatory Capital. For the purposes of paragraph 
(a) of this section, you may compute a higher maximum permitted 
investment in a Small Business (an ``increased limit'') by adding ``net 
unrealized gains'' on Publicly Traded and Marketable securities to your 
Regulatory Capital, subject to the following conditions:
    (1) ``Net unrealized gains'' on Publicly Traded and Marketable 
securities means unrealized gains on Publicly Traded and Marketable 
securities minus unrealized losses on all Loans and Investments.
    (2) You must value your Publicly Traded and Marketable securities in 
accordance with your SBA-approved valuation policy.
    (3) You must have positive Retained Earnings Available for 
Distribution at the time you compute an increased limit under this 
paragraph (c).
    (4) At the time you first compute an increased limit, and as of the 
first business day of each calendar quarter that the increased limit is 
in effect, you must keep copies in your files of the NASDAQ listings (or 
the Wall Street Journal) or written quotations from the market makers 
quoting the Publicly Traded and Marketable securities which support the 
adjustment.
    (5) If your net unrealized gains on Publicly Traded and Marketable 
securities are more than 30 percent below their original level on the 
first business day of any calendar quarter, and remain so for the next 
30 days, you agree to do one of the following to remain in compliance 
with the terms of your Leverage:
    (i) By the first day of the next calendar quarter, increase your 
Regulatory Capital sufficiently to restore support for the increased 
limit; or
    (ii) Lower the increased limit to reflect the decrease in net 
unrealized gains on Publicly Traded and Marketable securities, and 
reduce any Financings that exceed the lower limit.

    Example to paragraph (c) of this section. Your Regulatory Capital is 
$2,500,000 and your overline limit is $500,000 (20 percent of 
$2,500,000). On January 15, 1995, you document net unrealized gains on 
Publicly Traded and Marketable securities of $200,000 and compute an 
increased limit of $540,000 (20 percent of $2,700,000). You now make an 
investment of $540,000 in a Small Business. Nothing changes until the 
first business day

[[Page 56]]

of April, 1996, when you document net unrealized gains on Publicly 
Traded and Marketable securities of only $120,000, a reduction of more 
than 30 percent. Your net unrealized gains remain at this level for the 
next 30 days. Your increased limit is now only $524,000 (20 percent of 
$2,620,000). By July 1, 1996, you must either increase Regulatory 
Capital by $80,000 to restore your increased limit to $540,000, or 
reduce your portfolio investment from $540,000 to $524,000.

<R05>
Sec. 107.750  Conditions for financing a change of ownership of a Small Business.

    You may finance a change of ownership of a Small Business only under 
the conditions set forth in this section.
    (a) The Financing must:
    (1) Promote the sound development or preserve the existence of the 
Small Business;
    (2) Help create a Small Business as a result of a corporate 
divestiture; or
    (3) Facilitate ownership in a Disadvantaged Business.
    (b) The Resulting Concern (as defined in paragraph (c) of this 
section) must:
    (1) Be a Small Business under Sec. 107.700;
    (2) Have 500 or fewer full-time equivalent employees; or meet one of 
the appropriate debt/equity ratio tests:
    (i) If you have outstanding Leverage, the Resulting Concern's ratio 
of debt to equity must be no more than 5 to 1; or
    (ii) If you have no outstanding Leverage, the Resulting Concern's 
ratio of debt to equity must be no more than 8 to 1.
    (c) Definitions. (1) The ``Resulting Concern'' is determined by 
viewing the business as though the change of ownership had already 
occurred, giving effect to all contemplated financing, mergers, and 
acquisitions.
    (2) For purposes of this section, ``debt'' means long-term debt, 
including contingent liabilities, but excluding accounts payable, 
operating leases, letters of credit, subordinated notes payable to the 
seller, any other liabilities approved for exclusion by SBA and short-
term working capital loans (so long as the loans carry a zero balance 
for 30 consecutive days during the concern's fiscal year).
    (3) For purposes of this section, ``equity'' means common and 
preferred stock (corporation), contributed capital (partnership), or 
membership interests (limited liability company).


<R05>
Sec. 107.760  How a change in size or activity of a Portfolio Concern affects the Licensee and the Portfolio Concern.

    (a) Effect on Licensee of a change in size of a Portfolio Concern. 
If a Portfolio Concern no longer qualifies as a Small Business you may 
keep your investment in the concern and:
    (1) Subject to the overline limitations of Sec. 107.740, you may 
provide additional Financing to the concern up to the time it makes a 
public offering of its securities.
    (2) Even after the concern makes a public offering, you may exercise 
any stock options, warrants, or other rights to purchase Equity 
Securities which you acquired before the public offering, or fund 
Commitments you made before the public offering.
    (b) Effect of a change in business activity occurring within one 
year of Licensee's initial Financing--(1) Retention of Investment. 
Unless you receive SBA's written approval, you may not keep your 
investment in a Portfolio Concern, small or otherwise, which becomes 
ineligible by reason of a change in its business activity within one 
year of your initial investment.
    (2) Request for SBA's approval to retain investment. If you request 
that SBA approve the retention of your investment, your request must 
include sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the change in business 
activity was caused by an unforeseen change in circumstances and was not 
contemplated at the time the Financing was made.
    (3) Additional Financing. If SBA approves your request to retain an 
investment under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, you may provide 
additional Financing to the Portfolio Concern to the extent necessary to 
protect against the loss of the amount of your original investment, 
subject to the overline limitations of Sec. 107.740.
    (c) Effect of a change in business activity occurring more than one 
year after the initial Financing. If a Portfolio Concern becomes 
ineligible because of a change

[[Page 57]]

in business activity more than one year after your initial Financing you 
may:
    (1) Retain your investment; and
    (2) Provide additional Financing to the Portfolio Concern to the 
extent necessary to protect against the loss of the amount of your 
original investment, subject to the overline limitations of 
Sec. 107.740.

Structuring Licensee's Financing of Eligible Small Businesses: Types of 
                                Financing


<R05>
Sec. 107.800  Financings in the form of Equity Securities.

    (a) You may purchase the Equity Securities of a Small Business. You 
may not, inadvertently or otherwise:
    (1) Become a general partner in any unincorporated business; or
    (2) Become jointly or severally liable for any obligations of an 
unincorporated business.
    (b) Definition. Equity Securities means stock of any class in a 
corporation, stock options, warrants, limited partnership interests in a 
limited partnership, membership interests in a limited liability 
company, or joint venture interests. If the Financing agreement contains 
debt-type acceleration provisions or includes redemption provisions 
other than those permitted under Sec. 107.850, the security will be 
considered a Debt Security for purposes of Sec. 107.855.


<R05>
Sec. 107.810  Financings in the form of Loans.

    You may make Loans to Small Businesses. A Loan means a transaction 
evidenced by a debt instrument with no provision for you to acquire 
Equity Securities.


<R05>
Sec. 107.815  Financings in the form of Debt Securities.

    You may purchase Debt Securities from Small Businesses.
    (a) Definition. Debt Securities are instruments evidencing a loan 
with an option or any other right to acquire Equity Securities in a 
Small Business or its Affiliates, or a loan which by its terms is 
convertible into an equity position. Consideration must be paid for all 
options that you acquire.
    (b) Restriction on options obtained by Licensee's management and 
employees. If you have outstanding Leverage or plan to obtain Leverage, 
your employees, officers, directors or general partners, or the general 
partners of the management company that is providing services to you or 
to your general partner, may obtain options in a Financed Small Business 
only if:
    (1) They participate in the Financing on a pari passu basis with 
you; or
    (2) SBA gives its prior written approval; or
    (3) The options received are compensation for service as a member of 
the board of directors of the Small Business, and such compensation does 
not exceed that paid to other outside directors. In the absence of such 
directors, fees must be reasonable when compared with amounts paid to 
outside directors of similar companies.


<R05>
Sec. 107.820  Financings in the form of guarantees.

    At the request of a Small Business or where necessary to protect 
your existing investment, you may guarantee the monetary obligation of a 
Small Business to any non-Associate creditor.
    (a) You may not issue a guaranty if:
    (1) You would become subject to State regulation as an insurance, 
guaranty or surety business;
    (2) The amount of the guaranty plus any direct Financings to the 
Small Business exceed the overline limitations of Sec. 107.740, except 
that a pledge of the Equity Securities of the issuer or a subordination 
of your lien or creditor position does not count toward your overline; 
or
    (3) The total financing cost to the Small Business exceeds the cost 
of money limits of Sec. 107.855.
    (b) Pledge of Licensee's assets as guaranty. For purposes of this 
section, a guaranty with recourse only to specific asset(s) you have 
pledged is equal to the fair market value of such asset(s) or the amount 
of the debt guaranteed, whichever is less.


<R05>
Sec. 107.825  Purchasing securities from an underwriter or other third party.

    (a) Securities purchased through or from an underwriter. You may 
purchase

[[Page 58]]

the securities of a Small Business through or from an underwriter if:
    (1) You purchase such securities within 90 days of the date the 
public offering is first made;
    (2) Your purchase price is no more than the original public offering 
price; and
    (3) The amount paid by you for the securities (less ordinary and 
reasonable underwriting charges and commissions) has been, or will be, 
paid to the Small Business, and the underwriter certifies in writing 
that this requirement has been met.
    (b) Recordkeeping requirements. If you have outstanding Leverage or 
plan to obtain Leverage, you must keep records available for SBA's 
inspection which show the relevant details of the transaction, 
including, but not limited to, date, price, commissions, and the 
underwriter's certifications required under paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (c) Underwriter's requirements. If you have outstanding Leverage or 
plan to obtain Leverage, the underwriter must certify whether it is your 
Associate. You may pay reasonable and customary commissions and expenses 
to an Associate underwriter for the portion of an offering that you 
purchase, provided it is no more than 25 percent of the total offering. 
If you buy more than 25 percent of the offering, the amount you pay to 
the Associate underwriter must not exceed the total of the application 
and closing fees and reimbursable expenses permitted by Sec. 107.860.
    (d) Securities purchased from another Licensee or from SBA. You may 
purchase from, or exchange with, another Licensee, Portfolio securities 
(or any interest therein). Such purchase or exchange may only be made on 
a non-recourse basis. You may not have more than one-third of your total 
assets(valued at cost) invested in such securities. If you have 
previously sold Portfolio Securities (or any interest therein) on a 
recourse basis, you shall include the amount for which you may be 
contingently liable in your overline computation.
    (e) Purchases of securities from other non-issuers. You may purchase 
securities of a Small Business from a non-issuer not previously 
described in this Sec. 107.825 if:
    (1) Such acquisition is a reasonably necessary part of the overall 
sound Financing of the Small Business under the Act; or
    (2) The securities are acquired to finance a change of ownership 
under Sec. 107.750.

 Structuring Licensee's Financing of an Eligible Small Business: Terms 
                       and Conditions of Financing


<R05>
Sec. 107.830  Minimum duration/term of financing.

    (a) General rule for Section 301(c) Licensees. If you are a Section 
301(c) Licensee, the duration/term of all your Financings must be for a 
minimum period of five years. Exception: You may finance a Disadvantaged 
Business for a minimum term of four years.
    (b) General rule for Section 301(d) Licensees. The duration/term of 
your Financings may be for a minimum period of four years.
    (c) Restrictions on mandatory redemption of Equity Securities. If 
you have acquired Equity Securities, options or warrants on terms that 
include redemption by the Small Business, you must not require 
redemption by the Small Business within the first five years of your 
acquisition except as permitted in Sec. 107.850.
    (d) Special rules for Loans and Debt Securities. (1) Term. The 
minimum term for Loans and Debt Securities starts with the first 
disbursement of the Financing.
    (2) Prepayment before five years. You must permit voluntary 
prepayment of Loans and Debt Securities by the Small Business at any 
time during the initial five year term. You must obtain SBA's prior 
written approval of any restrictions on the ability of the Small 
Business to prepay other than the imposition of a reasonable prepayment 
penalty under paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
    (3) Prepayment penalties. You may charge a reasonable prepayment 
penalty which must be agreed upon at the time of the Financing. If SBA 
determines that a prepayment penalty is unreasonable, you must refund 
the entire

[[Page 59]]

penalty to the Small Business. A prepayment penalty equal to 5 percent 
of the outstanding balance during the first year of any Financing, 
declining by one percentage point per year through the fifth year, is 
considered reasonable.


<R05>
Sec. 107.835  Exceptions to minimum duration/term of Financing.

    You may make a Short-term Financing for a term less than five years 
if the Financing is:
    (a) An interim financing (for a period not to exceed one year) in 
contemplation of long-term Financing. The contemplated long-term 
Financing must be in an amount at least equal to the short-term 
Financing, and must be made by you alone or in participation with other 
investors; or
    (b) For protection of your prior investment(s); or
    (c) For the purpose of Financing a change of ownership under 
Sec. 107.750. The total amount of such Financings may not exceed 20 
percent of your Loans and Investments (at cost) at the end of any fiscal 
year; or
    (d) For the purpose of aiding a Small Business in performing a 
contract awarded under a Federal, State, or local government set-aside 
program for ``minority'' or ``disadvantaged'' contractors.


<R05>
Sec. 107.840  Maximum term of Financing.

    The maximum term of any Loan or Debt Security Financing must be no 
longer than 20 years.


<R05>
Sec. 107.845  Maximum rate of amortization on Loans and Debt Securities.

    The principal of any Loan (or the loan portion of a Debt Security) 
with a term of five years or less cannot be amortized faster than 
straight line. If the term is greater than five years, the principal 
cannot be amortized faster than straight line for the first five years.


<R05>
Sec. 107.850  Restrictions on redemption of Equity Securities.

    (a) A Portfolio Concern cannot be required to redeem Equity 
Securities earlier than five years from the date of the first closing 
unless:
    (1) The concern makes a public offering, or has a change of 
management or control, or files for protection under the provisions of 
the Bankruptcy Code, or materially breaches your Financing agreement; or
    (2) You make a follow-on investment, in which case the new 
securities may be redeemed in less than five years, but no earlier than 
the redemption date associated with your earliest Financing of the 
concern.
    (b) The redemption price must be either:
    (1) A fixed amount that is no higher than the price you paid for the 
securities; or
    (2) An amount that cannot be fixed or determined before the time of 
redemption. In this case, the redemption price must be based on:
    (i) A reasonable formula that reflects the performance of the 
concern (such as one based on earnings or book value); or
    (ii) The fair market value of the concern at the time of redemption, 
as determined by a professional appraisal performed under an agreement 
acceptable to both parties.
    (c) Any method for determining the redemption price must be agreed 
upon no later than the date of the first (or only) closing of the 
Financing.


<R05>
Sec. 107.855  Interest rate ceiling and limitations on fees charged to Small Businesses (``Cost of Money'').

    ``Cost of Money'' means the interest and other consideration that 
you receive from a Small Business. Subject to lower ceilings prescribed 
by local law, the Cost of Money to the Small Business must not exceed 
the ceiling determined under this section.
    (a) Financings to which the Cost of Money rules apply. This section 
applies to all Loans and Debt Securities. As required by 
Sec. 107.800(b), you must include as Debt Securities any equity 
interests with redemption provisions that do not meet the restrictions 
in Sec. 107.850.
    (b) When to determine the Cost of Money ceiling for a Financing. You 
may determine your Cost of Money ceiling for a particular Financing as 
of the date you issue a Commitment or as of the date of the first 
closing of the Financing. Once determined, the Cost of

[[Page 60]]

Money ceiling remains fixed for the duration of the Financing.
    (c) How to determine the Cost of Money ceiling for a Financing. At a 
minimum, you may use a Cost of Money ceiling of 19 percent for a Loan 
and 14 percent for a Debt Security. To determine whether you may charge 
more, do the following:
    (1) Choose a base rate for your Cost of Money computation. The base 
rate may be either the Debenture Rate currently in effect plus the 
applicable Charge determined under Sec. 107.1130(d)(1), or your own 
``Cost of Capital'' as determined under paragraph (d) of this section.
    (2) For a Loan, add 11 percentage points to the base rate; for a 
Debt Security, add 6 percentage points. In either case, round the sum 
down to the nearest eighth of one percent.
    (3) If the result is more than 19 percent (for a Loan) or 14 percent 
(for a Debt Security), you may use it as your Cost of Money ceiling.
    (4) If two or more Licensees participate in the same Financing of a 
Small Business, the base rate used in this paragraph (c) is the highest 
of the following:
    (i) The current Debenture Rate plus the applicable Charge determined 
under Sec. 107.1130(d)(1);
    (ii) The Cost of Capital of the lead Licensee; or
    (iii) The weighted average of the Cost of Capital for all Licensees 
participating in the Financing.
    (d) How to determine your Cost of Capital. ``Cost of Capital'' is an 
optional computation of the weighted average interest rate you pay on 
your ``qualified borrowings''. ``Qualified borrowings'' means your 
Debentures together with your borrowings at or below the usual interest 
rate charged by banks in your locality on the date your loan was made.
    (1) For any fiscal year, you may compute your Cost of Capital:
    (i) As of the first day of your fiscal year, to remain in effect for 
the entire year; or
    (ii) As of the first day of every fiscal quarter during the fiscal 
year, to remain in effect for the duration of the quarter.
    (2) For each qualified borrowing outstanding at your last fiscal 
year or fiscal quarter end, multiply the ending principal balance (net 
of related unamortized fees) by the number of days during the past four 
fiscal quarters that the borrowing was outstanding, and divide the 
result by 365.
    (3) Add together the amounts computed for all borrowings under 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section. The result is your weighted average 
borrowings.
    (4) For all qualified borrowings outstanding at your last fiscal 
year or fiscal quarter end, determine the aggregate interest expense for 
the past four fiscal quarters, excluding amortization of loan fees. For 
the purposes of this paragraph (d)(4):
    (i) Interest expense on Debentures includes the 1 percent Charge 
paid by a Licensee under Sec. 107.1130(d)(1); and
    (ii) Section 301(d) Licensees with outstanding subsidized Debentures 
are presumed to have paid interest at the rate stated on the face of 
such Debentures, without regard to any subsidy paid by SBA.
    (5) Divide the interest expense from paragraph (d)(4) of this 
section by the weighted average borrowings from paragraph (d)(3) of this 
section, and multiply by 100. The result is your Cost of Capital, which 
you may use to compute a Cost of Money ceiling under paragraph (c) of 
this section.
    (e) SBA review of Cost of Capital computation. You must keep your 
Cost of Capital computations in a separate file available for SBA's 
review.
    (1) A computation that is kept in such a file and is audited by your 
independent public accountant is considered correct unless SBA 
demonstrates otherwise.
    (2) If a computation is not kept in such a file or is unaudited, you 
must prove its accuracy to SBA's satisfaction.
    (f) Charges included in the Cost of Money. The Cost of Money 
includes all interest, points, discounts, fees, royalties, profit 
participation, and any other consideration you receive from a Small 
Business, except for the specific exclusions in paragraph (g) of this 
section. For equity interests subject to the Cost of Money rules (see 
paragraph (a) of this section), you must include:

[[Page 61]]

    (1) The portion of the fixed redemption price that exceeds your 
original cost.
    (2) Any amount of a redemption that is paid out of accounts other 
than the Small Business's capital accounts (capital, paid-in surplus, or 
retained earnings of a corporation; or partners' capital of a 
partnership).
    (g) Charges excluded from the Cost of Money. You may exclude from 
the Cost of Money:
    (1) Discount on the loan portion of a Debt Security, if such 
discount exists solely as the result of the allocation of value to 
detachable stock purchase warrants in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles.
    (2) Closing fees, application fees, and expense reimbursements, each 
as permitted under Sec. 107.860.
    (3) Reasonable prepayment penalties permitted under 
Sec. 107.830(d)(3).
    (4) Out-of-pocket conveyance and/or recordation fees and taxes.
    (5) Reasonable closing costs.
    (6) Fees for management services as permitted under Sec. 107.900.
    (7) Reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket expenses you incur to 
monitor the Financing.
    (8) Board of director fees not in excess of those paid to other 
outside directors, if your board representation meets the requirements 
of Sec. 107.730(e).
    (9) A reasonable fee for arranging financing for a Small Business 
from a source that is neither a Licensee nor an Associate of yours. The 
Small Business must agree in writing to pay such a fee before you 
arrange the financing.
    (10) A one-time ``bonus'' that satisfies the requirements in 
paragraph (i) of this section.
    (11) The difference between the contractual interest rate of the 
Financing and a default rate of interest permitted as follows:
    (i) If a Small Business is in default, you may charge a default rate 
of interest as much as 7 percentage points higher than the contractual 
rate until the default is cured.
    (ii) For this purpose, ``default'' means either failure to pay an 
amount when due or failure to provide information required under the 
Financing documents.
    (h) How to evaluate compliance with the Cost of Money ceiling. You 
must determine whether a Financing is within the Cost of Money ceiling 
based on its discounted cash flows, as follows:
    (1) Beginning with the date of the first disbursement (``period 
zero''), identify your cash inflows and cash outflows for each period of 
the Financing. The appropriate period to use (such as years, quarters, 
or months) depends on how you have structured the disbursements and 
payments.
    (2) Discount the cash flows back to the first disbursement date 
using the Cost of Money ceiling from paragraph (d) of this section as 
the discount rate.
    (3) If the result is zero or less, the Financing is within the Cost 
of Money ceiling; if it is greater than zero, the Financing exceeds the 
Cost of Money ceiling.
    (i) ``Bonus'' paid by a Small Business. You may provide Financing to 
a Small Business that includes both a loan and a one-time ``bonus'' 
determined at the end of the loan term. For Cost of Money purposes, you 
must treat such a Financing as a Debt Security. You may exclude a bonus 
from the Cost of Money only if it is:
    (1) Computed on or after the date that the Financing is repaid in 
full or was originally due to be repaid in full, whichever is earlier;
    (2) Not fixed or determinable before the computation date; and
    (3) Fully contingent upon factor(s) that reflect the performance of 
the Small Business. The period for which such performance is measured 
must not extend beyond the Small Business's fiscal year end immediately 
following repayment of the Financing. You must demonstrate to SBA's 
satisfaction that the factor(s) used are appropriate indicators of 
performance. Examples of generally acceptable factors include net income 
and operating cash flow; examples of generally unacceptable factors 
include gross revenues or gross margin.

<R05>
Sec. 107.860  Financing fees and expense reimbursements a Licensee may receive from a Small Business.

    You may collect Financing fees and receive expense reimbursements 
from a Small Business only as permitted under this Sec. 107.860.
    (a) Application fee. You may collect a nonrefundable application fee 
from a Small Business to review its Financing application. The 
application fee may be collected at the same time as the closing fee 
under paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, or earlier. The fee must be:
    (1) No more than 1 percent of the amount of Financing requested (or, 
if two or more Licensees participate in the Financing, their combined 
application fees are no more than 1 percent of the total Financing 
requested); and
    (2) Agreed to in writing by the Financing applicant.
    (b) SBA review of application fees. For any fiscal year, if the 
number of application fees you collect is more than twice the number of 
Financings closed, SBA in its sole discretion may determine that you are 
engaged in activities not contemplated by the Act, in violation of 
Sec. 107.500.
    (c) Closing fee--Loans. You may charge a closing fee on a Loan if:
    (1) The fee is no more than 2 percent of the Financing amount (or, 
if two or more Licensees participate in the Financing, their combined 
closing fees are no more than 2 percent of the total Financing amount); 
and
    (2) You charge the fee no earlier than the date of the first 
disbursement.
    (d) Closing fee--Debt or Equity Financings. You may charge a Closing 
Fee on a Debt Security or Equity Security Financing if:
    (1) The fee is no more than 4 percent of the Financing amount (or, 
if two or more Licensees participate in the Financing, their combined 
closing fees are no more than 4 percent of the total Financing amount); 
and
    (2) You charge the fee no earlier than the date of the first 
disbursement.
    (e) Limitation on dual fees. If another Licensee or an Associate of 
yours collects a transaction fee under Sec. 107.900(e) in connection 
with your Financing of a Small Business, the sum of the transaction fee 
and your application and closing fees cannot exceed the maximum 
application and closing fees permitted under this Sec. 107.860.
    (f) Expense reimbursements. You may charge a Small Business for the 
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, other than Management Expenses, that 
you incur to process its Financing application. If SBA determines that 
any of your reimbursed expenses are unreasonable or are Management 
Expenses, SBA will require you to include such amounts in the Cost of 
Money or refund them to the Small Business.
    (g) Breakup fee. If a Small Business accepts your Commitment and 
then fails to close the Financing because it has accepted funds from 
another source, you may charge a ``breakup fee'' equal to the closing 
fee that you would have been permitted to charge under paragraph (c) or 
(d) of this section.

The balance of such officials may be elected through mutual agreement by 
management and the Investor Group.
    (d) Temporary Control permitted. You may acquire temporary Control:
    (1) Where reasonably necessary for the protection of your existing 
investment;
    (2) If there has been a material breach of the Financing agreement 
by the Small Business;
    (3) If there has been a substantial change in the Small Business's 
operations or products during the past 2 years, or such a change is the 
intended result of the Financing, and the Investor Group's Financing 
constitutes the Small Business's major source of capital; or
    (4) In the case of a Start-up Financing, if you or the Investor 
Group constitute the Small Business's major source of capital.
    (e) Control certification. If you take temporary Control of a Small 
Business under paragraph (d) of this section, you must file a Control 
certification with SBA within 30 days. The certification must state:
    (1) The date on which you took Control;

    (3) Your agreement to relinquish Control within five years (although 
you may, under extraordinary circumstances, request SBA's approval of an 
extension beyond five years).
    (f) Control acquired through enforcement actions. If you retain or 
acquire Control through enforcement action, you must notify SBA 
immediately and submit a Control certification within 30 days.
    (g) Additional Financing for businesses under Licensee's Control. If

       Maximum Amount of Leverage for Which a Licensee Is Eligible


<R05>
Sec. 107.1150  Maximum amount of Leverage for a Section 301(c) Licensee.

    (a) Maximum amount of Leverage. If you are a Section 301(c) 
Licensee, use the following table to determine the maximum amount of 
Leverage you may have outstanding at any time:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                             Then your maximum Leverage
     If your Leverageable Capital is:                    is:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not over $15,000,000......................  300% of Leverageable
                                             Capital.
Over $15,000,000 but not over $30,000,000.  $45,000,000 + [200% of
                                             [Leverageable Capital--
                                             $15,000,000)].
Over $30,000,000 but not over $45,000,000.  $75,000,000 + [100% of
                                             [(Leverageable Capital--
                                             $30,000,000)].
Over $45,000,000..........................  $90,000,000.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Exceptions to maximum Leverage provisions--(1) Licensees under 
Common Control. Two or more Licensees under Common Control may have 
aggregate outstanding Leverage over $90,000,000 only if SBA gives them 
permission to do so. SBA may grant such permission on a case-by-case 
basis only. SBA may impose any terms and conditions SBA considers 
appropriate to minimize its risk of loss in the event of default.
    (2) Licensees with excess Leverage issued before March 31, 1993. If 
you had outstanding Debentures on March 31, 1993 that exceeded 300 
percent of your Leverageable Capital:
    (i) You do not have to prepay the excess amount.
    (ii) You may apply for an additional Debenture guarantee or 
Participating

[[Page 67]]

Security guarantee if you use the proceeds solely to pay the amount due 
at maturity on a Debenture issued before March 31, 1993. The new 
Debenture or Participating Security must mature on or before September 
30, 2002.
    (iii) You must maintain at least 65 percent of your ``Total Funds 
Available for Investment'' in ``Venture Capital Financings'' (as defined 
in Sec. 107.1160(e) and (f), respectively) until your outstanding 
Debentures no longer exceed 300 percent of your Leverageable Capital.
    (3) Maximum amount of Participating Securities. See Sec. 107.1170.


<R05>
Sec. 107.1160  Maximum amount of Leverage for a Section 301(d) Licensee.

    This section applies to Leverage issued by a Section 301(d) Licensee 
on or before September 30, 1996. Effective October 1, 1996, a Section 
301(d) Licensee may apply to issue new Leverage, or refinance existing 
Leverage, only on the same terms permitted under Sec. 107.1150.
    (a) Maximum amount of subsidized Leverage. (1) ``Subsidized 
Leverage'' means Debentures with a reduced interest rate and Preferred 
Securities. If you are a Section 301(d) Licensee:
    (i) The maximum amount of subsidized Leverage you may have 
outstanding at any time is the lesser of 400 percent of your 
Leverageable Capital, or $35,000,000. The same limit applies to a group 
of Section 301(d) Licensees under Common Control.
    (ii) The maximum amount of Preferred Securities you may have 
outstanding at any time is 200 percent of your Leverageable Capital.
    (2) Certain types and amounts of subsidized Leverage have special 
eligibility requirements (see paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section).
    (b) Maximum amount of total Leverage. Use Sec. 107.1150 (a) and 
(b)(1) to determine your maximum amount of Leverage as if you were a 
Section 301(c) Licensee. If the result is more than your maximum 
subsidized Leverage, then this is your maximum total (subsidized plus 
non-subsidized) Leverage. Otherwise, your maximum total Leverage is the 
same as your maximum subsidized Leverage. For Participating Securities, 
see Sec. 107.1170.
    (c) Special eligibility requirements for fourth tier of Leverage. A 
``fourth tier of Leverage'' is any amount of outstanding Leverage in 
excess of 300 percent of your Leverageable Capital.
    (1) To qualify for a fourth tier of Leverage, you must have invested 
(or have Commitments to invest) at least 30 percent of your ``Total 
Funds Available for Investment'' in ``Venture Capital Financings'' (see 
the definitions in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section).
    (2) While you have a fourth tier of Leverage, you must maintain 
Venture Capital Financings (at cost) that equal at least 30 percent of 
your Total Funds Available for Investment.
    (d) Special eligibility requirements for second tier of Preferred 
Securities. A ``second tier of Preferred Securities'' is any amount of 
outstanding Preferred Securities in excess of 100 percent of your 
Leverageable Capital.
    (1) To qualify for a second tier of Preferred Securities:
    (i) If your license was issued after October 13, 1971, you must have 
at least $500,000 of Leverageable Capital.
    (ii) You must have invested (or have Commitments to invest) at least 
the same dollar amount in Venture Capital Financings.
    (2) While you have a second tier of Preferred Securities, you must 
maintain at least the same dollar amount of Venture Capital Financings 
(at cost).
    (e) Definition of ``Total Funds Available for Investment''. Total 
Funds Available for Investment means the result obtained from the 
following formula:

T = .90  x  (CA + LI)

Where:

T = Total funds available for investment
CA = Total current assets
LI = Total Loans and Investment at cost (as reported on SBA Form 468), 
net of current maturities

    (f) Definition of ``Venture Capital Financing''. Venture Capital 
Financing means an investment represented by common or preferred stock, 
a limited partnership interest, or a similar ownership interest; or by 
an unsecured debt instrument that is subordinated by its terms to all 
other borrowings of the issuer.

[[Page 68]]

    (1) A debt secured by any agreement with a third party is not a 
Venture Capital Financing, whether or not you have a security interest 
in any asset of the third party or have recourse against the third 
party.
    (2) A Financing that originally qualified as a Venture Capital 
Financing will continue to qualify (at its original cost), even if you 
later must report it on SBA Form 468 under either Assets Acquired in 
Liquidation of Portfolio Securities or Operating Concerns Acquired.

    (a) Partial prepayment of leverage fee. As a condition of SBA's 
Leverage commitment, and before you draw any Leverage under such 
commitment, you must pay to SBA a non-refundable fee equal to 1 percent 
of the face amount of the Debentures or Participating Securities 
reserved under the commitment. This amount represents a partial 
prepayment of the 3 percent leverage fee established under 
Sec. 107.1130(a).
    (b) Automatic cancellation of commitment. Unless you pay the fee 
required under paragraph (a) of this section by 5:00 P.M. Eastern Time 
on the 30th calendar day following the issuance of SBA's Leverage 
commitment, the commitment will be automatically canceled.

<R05>
Sec. 107.1220  Requirement for Licensee to file quarterly financial statements.

    As long as any part of SBA's Leverage commitment is outstanding, you 
must give SBA a Financial Statement on SBA Form 468 (Short Form) as of 
the close of each quarter of your fiscal year (other than your fourth 
fiscal quarter, which is covered by your annual filing of Form 468 under 
Sec. 107.630(a)). You must file this form within 30 days after the close 
of the quarter, or with any request for a draw that you make within such 
30-day period. You will not be eligible for a draw if you are not in 
compliance with this Sec. 107.1220.


<R05>
Sec. 107.1230  Draw-downs by Licensee under SBA's Leverage commitment.

    (a) Licensee's authorization of SBA to purchase or guarantee 
securities. By submitting a request for a draw against SBA's Leverage 
commitment, you authorize SBA, or any agent or trustee SBA designates, 
to guarantee your Debenture or Participating Security and to sell it 
with SBA's guarantee.
    (b) Limitations on amount of draw. The amount of a draw must be a 
multiple of

[[Page 69]]

$5,000. SBA, in its discretion, may determine a minimum dollar amount 
for draws against SBA's Leverage commitments. Any such minimum amounts 
will be published in Notices in the Federal Register from time to time.
    (c) Effect of regulatory violations on Licensee's eligibility for 
draws--(1) General rule. You are eligible to make a draw against SBA's 
Leverage commitment only if you are in compliance with all applicable 
provisions of the Act and SBA regulations (i.e., no unresolved statutory 
or regulatory violations).
    (2) Exception to general rule. If you are not in compliance, you may 
still be eligible for draws if:
    (i) SBA determines that your outstanding violations are of non-
substantive provisions of the Act or regulations and that you have not 
repeatedly violated any non-substantive provisions; or
    (ii) You have agreed with SBA on a course of action to resolve your 
violations and such agreement does not prevent you from issuing 
Leverage.
    (d) Procedures for funding draws. You may request a draw at any time 
during the term of the commitment. With each request, submit the 
following documentation:
    (1) If your request is submitted within 30 days following the close 
of your fiscal quarter, a Financial Statement on SBA Form 468 (Short 
Form) prepared as of the close of that fiscal quarter; otherwise, a 
statement certifying that there has been no material adverse change in 
your financial condition since your last filing of SBA Form 468 (Long or 
Short Form).
    (2) A statement certifying that to the best of your knowledge and 
belief, you are in compliance with all provisions of the Act and SBA 
regulations (i.e., no unresolved regulatory or statutory violations), or 
a statement listing any specific violations you are aware of. Either 
statement must be executed by one of the following:
    (i) An officer of the Licensee;
    (ii) An officer of a corporate general partner of the Licensee; or
    (iii) An individual who is authorized to act as or for a general 
partner of the Licensee.
    (3) A statement that the proceeds are needed to fund one or more 
particular Small Businesses. If required by SBA, the statement must 
include the name and address of each Small Business, and the amount and 
anticipated closing date of each proposed Financing.
    (e) Reporting requirements after drawing funds. (1) Within 30 
calendar days after the actual closing date of each Financing funded 
with the proceeds of your draw, you must file an SBA Form 1031 
confirming the closing of the transaction.
    (2) If SBA required you to provide information concerning a specific 
planned Financing under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, and such 
Financing has not closed within 60 calendar days after the anticipated 
closing date, you must give SBA a written explanation of the failure to 
close.
    (3) If you do not comply with this paragraph (e), you will not be 
eligible for additional draws. SBA may also determine that you are not 
in compliance with the terms of your Leverage under Secs. 107.1810 or 
107.1820.

Sec. 107.1240  Funding of Licensee's draw request through sale to short-term investor.

    (a) Licensee's authorization of SBA to arrange sale of securities to 
short-term investor. By submitting a request for a draw of Debenture or 
Participating Security Leverage, you authorize SBA, or any agent or 
trustee SBA designates, to enter into any agreements (and to bind you to 
such agreements) necessary to accomplish:
    (1) The sale of your Debenture or Participating Security to a short-
term investor at a rate that may be different from the Trust Certificate 
Rate which will be established at the time of the pooling of your 
security;
    (2) The purchase of your security from the short-term investor, 
either by you or on your behalf; and
    (3) The pooling of your security with other securities with the same 
maturity date.
    (b) Sale of Debentures to a short-term investor. If SBA sells your 
Debenture to a short-term investor:
    (1) The sale price will be the face amount.

[[Page 70]]

    (2) At the next scheduled date for the sale of Debenture Trust 
Certificates, whether or not the sale actually occurs, you must pay 
interest to the short-term investor for the short-term period. If the 
actual sale of Trust Certificates takes place after the scheduled date, 
you must pay the short-term investor interest from the scheduled sale 
date to the actual sale date. This additional interest is due on the 
actual sale date.
    (3) Failure to pay the interest constitutes noncompliance with the 
terms of your Leverage (see Sec. 107.1810).
    (c) Sale of Participating Securities to a short-term investor. If 
SBA sells your Participating Security to a short-term investor, the sale 
price will be the face amount.
    (d) Licensee's right to repurchase its Debentures before pooling. 
You may repurchase your Debentures from the short-term investor before 
they are pooled. To do so, you must:
    (1) Give SBA written notice at least 10 days before the cut-off date 
for the pool in which your Debenture is to be included; and
    (2) Pay the face amount of the Debenture, plus interest, to the 
short-term investor.

         Preferred Securities Leverage--Section 301(d) Licensees


<R05>
Sec. 107.1400  Dividends or partnership distributions on 4 percent Preferred Securities.

    If you issued Preferred Securities to SBA on or after November 21, 
1989, you must pay SBA a dividend or partnership distribution of 4 
percent per year, from the date you issued Preferred Securities to the 
date you repay them, both inclusive. The dividend or partnership 
distribution is:
    (a) Computed on the par value of the outstanding stock or the face 
value of the outstanding limited partnership interest.
    (b) Cumulative. This means that if you do not pay the entire 
dividend or partnership distribution for a given fiscal year, the unpaid 
balance accumulates as a distribution in arrears. You do not have to pay 
interest on distributions in arrears.
    (c) Preferred. This means that you must pay SBA in full (including 
distributions in arrears) before setting aside or paying any amount to 
any other equity holder.
    (d) Payable at the discretion of your Board of Directors or General 
Partner(s), except that all distributions in arrears must be paid in 
full when you redeem the Preferred Securities.

<R05>
Sec. 107.1410  Requirement to redeem 4 percent Preferred Securities.

    You must redeem 4 percent Preferred Securities not later than 15 
years from the date of issuance. At the redemption date, you must pay to 
SBA:
    (a) The par value (of preferred stock) or face value (of a preferred 
limited partnership interest); plus
    (b) Any unpaid dividends or partnership distributions accrued to the 
redemption date.


<R05>
Sec. 107.1420  Articles requirements for 4 percent Preferred Securities.

<R05>
Sec. 107.1430  Redeeming 4 percent Preferred Securities with proceeds of non-subsidized Debentures.

Debenture to redeem Preferred Securities at their mandatory redemption 
date, including any accrued unpaid dividends or partnership 
distributions.

<R05>
Sec. 107.1440  Three percent preferred stock issued before November 21, 1989.

    Before November 21, 1989, Preferred Securities were available only 
in the form of preferred stock and had a preferred and cumulative 
dividend of 3 percent. If you have such preferred stock outstanding, you 
must follow

[[Page 71]]

Sec. 107.1400 (except for Sec. 107.1400(d)), substituting ``3 percent'' 
for ``4 percent'' throughout.) Dividends on 3 percent preferred stock 
are payable at the discretion of your Board of Directors or General 
Partner(s), except that all dividends in arrears must be paid in full 
before any non-SBA investor receives any distribution. Upon your 
liquidation, SBA is entitled to payment of all dividends in arrears even 
if you have no Retained Earnings Available for Distribution at such 
time.


<R05>
Sec. 107.1450  Optional redemption of Preferred Securities.

    (a) Redemption at par or face value. A Section 301(d) Licensee may 
redeem Preferred Securities at any time, provided you give SBA at least 
30 days written notice. You may redeem all or only part of your 
Preferred Securities, but the par value or face value of the securities 
being redeemed must be at least $50,000. At the redemption date, you 
must pay to SBA:
    (1) The par value (of preferred stock) or face value (of a preferred 
limited partnership interest); plus
    (2) Any unpaid dividends or partnership distributions accrued to the 
redemption date.
    (b) Repurchase of 3 percent preferred stock for less than par value. 
If you issued 3 percent preferred stock to SBA, you may ask SBA to sell 
it back to you at a price less than its par value. The terms and 
conditions of any such transaction will be as set forth in the Notice 
published in the Federal Register on April 1, 1994 (Copies of this 
notice are available from SBA, 409 3rd Street, SW., Washington, DC, 
20416). SBA has sole discretion to:
    (1) Approve or disapprove the sale.
    (2) Determine the sale price after considering any factors SBA 
considers appropriate.
    (3) Determine the form of payment SBA will accept. SBA is not 
authorized to accept the proceeds of a subsidized Debenture as payment.

                    Participating Securities Leverage


<R05>
Sec. 107.1500  General description of Participating Securities.

    (a) Types of Participating Securities. Participating Securities are 
redeemable, preferred, equity-type securities. SBA may purchase or 
guarantee Participating Securities issued by Licensees in the form of 
limited partnership interests, preferred stock, or debentures with 
interest payable only to the extent of earnings. The structure, terms 
and conditions of Participating Securities are set forth in detail in 
Secs. 107.1500 through 107.1590.
    (b) Special eligibility requirements for Participating Securities. 
In addition to the general eligibility requirements for Leverage under 
Sec. 107.1120, Participating Securities issuers must also comply with 
special rules on:
    (1) Minimum capital (see Sec. 107.210).
    (2) Liquidity (see Sec. 107.1505).
    (3) Non-SBA borrowing (see Sec. 107.570).
    (4) Equity investing, as set forth in this paragraph (b)(4). If you 
issue Participating Securities, you must invest an amount equal to the 
Original Issue Price of such securities solely in Equity Capital 
Investments, as defined in Sec. 107.50.
    (c) Special features of Participating Securities--Prioritized 
Payments, Adjustments, and Profit Participation. When you issue 
Participating Securities, you agree to make the following payments:
    (1) Prioritized Payments. Depending upon the type of Participating 
Security you issue, Prioritized Payments may be preferred partnership 
distributions, preferred dividends, or interest. Your obligation to pay 
Prioritized Payments is contingent upon your profits as determined under 
Sec. 107.1520.
    (2) Adjustments to Prioritized Payments. If you have unpaid 
Prioritized Payments, you must compute Adjustments, which are additional 
contingent obligations determined under Sec. 107.1520. The conditions 
for paying Adjustments are the same as for Prioritized Payments.
    (3) SBA Profit Participation. Profit Participation is an amount 
payable to SBA under Sec. 107.1530 in consideration for SBA's guarantee 
of your Participating Securities.
    (d) Distributions by Licensees issuing Participating Securities. 
Sections 107.1540 through 107.1580 govern both required and optional 
Distributions by Participating Securities issuers. Distributions include 
both profit distributions and

[[Page 72]]

returns of capital, paid either to SBA or to your non-SBA investors.
    (e) Mandatory redemption of Participating Securities. You must 
redeem Participating Securities at the redemption date, which is the 
same as the maturity date of the Trust Certificates for the Trust 
containing such securities. The redemption date can never be later than 
15 years after the issue date. You must pay the Redemption Price plus 
any unpaid Earned Prioritized Payments and any earned Adjustments and 
earned Charges (see Sec. 107.1520).
    (f) Priority of Participating Securities in liquidation of Licensee. 
In the event of your liquidation, the following are senior in priority, 
for all purposes, to all other equity interests you have issued at any 
time:
    (1) The Redemption Price of Participating Securities;
    (2) Any Earned Prioritized Payments and any earned Adjustments and 
earned Charges (see Sec. 107.1520); and
    (3) Any Profit Participation allocated to SBA under Sec. 107.1530.

Sec. 107.1505  Liquidity requirements for Licensees issuing Participating Securities.

    If you have outstanding Participating Securities, you must maintain 
sufficient liquidity to avoid a condition of Liquidity Impairment. Such 
a condition will constitute noncompliance with the terms of your 
Leverage under Sec. 107.1820(e).
    (a) Definition of Liquidity Impairment. A condition of Liquidity 
Impairment exists when your Liquidity Ratio, as determined in paragraph 
(b) of this section, is less than 1.20. You are responsible for 
calculating whether you have a condition of Liquidity Impairment:
    (1) As of the close of your fiscal year;
    (2) At the time you apply for Leverage, unless SBA permits 
otherwise; and
    (3) At such time as you contemplate making any Distribution.
    (b) Computation of Liquidity Ratio. Your Liquidity Ratio equals your 
Total Current Funds Available (A) divided by your Total Current Funds 
Required (B), as determined in the following table:

Sec. 107.1510  How a Licensee computes Earmarked Profit (Loss).

    Computing your Earmarked Profit (Loss) is the first step in 
determining your obligations to pay Prioritized Payments, Adjustments 
and Charges under Sec. 107.1520 and Profit Participation under 
Sec. 107.1530.
    (a) Requirement to compute your Earmarked Profit (Loss). While you 
have Participating Securities outstanding or have Earmarked Assets (as 
defined in paragraph (b) of this section), you must compute your 
Earmarked Profit (Loss) for:
    (1) Each full fiscal year.

[[Page 73]]

    (2) Any interim period (consisting of one or more fiscal quarters) 
for which you want to make a Distribution.
    (b) How to determine your Earmarked Assets. ``Earmarked Assets'' 
means all the Loans and Investments that you have when you issue 
Participating Securities or that you acquire while you have 
Participating Securities outstanding, and any non-cash assets that you 
receive in exchange for such Loans and Investments.
    (1) An Earmarked Asset remains earmarked until you dispose of it, 
even if you no longer have any outstanding Participating Securities.
    (2) Investments you make after redeeming all your Participating 
Securities are not Earmarked Assets. However, if you issue new 
Participating Securities, all of your Loans and Investments again become 
Earmarked Assets.
    (3) If you were licensed before March 31, 1993, you may be permitted 
to exclude Loans and Investments held at that date from Earmarked Assets 
under Sec. 107.1590.
    (c) How to compute your Earmarked Asset Ratio. You must determine 
your Earmarked Asset Ratio each time you compute Earmarked Profit 
(Loss). If all your Loans and Investments are Earmarked Assets, your 
Earmarked Asset Ratio equals 100 percent. Otherwise, compute your 
Earmarked Asset Ratio using the following formula:


EAR = (EA <divide> LI)  x  100

where:

    EAR = Earmarked Asset Ratio.
    EA = Average Earmarked Assets (at cost) for the fiscal year or 
interim period.
    LI = Average Loans and Investments (at cost) for the fiscal year or 
interim period.

    (d) How to compute your Earmarked Profit (Loss) if Earmarked Asset 
Ratio is 100 percent. (1) (i) If your Earmarked Asset Ratio from 
paragraph (b) of this section is 100 percent, use the following formula 
to compute your Earmarked Profit (Loss):

EP = NI + IK + EME

where:

EP = Earmarked Profit (Loss)
NI = Net Income (Loss), as reported on SBA Form 468 except as otherwise 
provided in this paragraph (d)(1)
IK = Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Earmarked Assets that you 
are distributing as an In-Kind Distribution under Sec. 107.1580
EME = Excess Management Expenses

    (ii) For the purpose of determining Net Income (Loss), leverage fees 
paid to SBA and partnership syndication costs that you incur must be 
capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over not less than 
five years.
    (2) ``Excess Management Expenses'' are those that exceed the 
following limit:
    (i) For a full fiscal year, the limit is the lower of:
    (A) 2.5 percent of your weighted average Combined Capital for the 
year, plus $125,000 if Combined Capital is below $20,000,000; or
    (B) Your Management Expenses approved by SBA.
    (ii) For less than a full fiscal year, you must prorate the annual 
amounts in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section to determine the limit.
    (e) How to compute your Earmarked Profit (Loss) if Earmarked Asset 
Ratio is less than 100 percent. If your Earmarked Asset Ratio is less 
than 100 percent, compute your Earmarked Profit (Loss) as follows:
    (1) Do the Earmarked Profit (Loss) computation in paragraph (d) of 
this section.
    (2) Subtract your net realized gain (loss) (as reported on SBA Form 
468) on Loans and Investments that are not Earmarked Assets.
    (3) Separate the result from paragraph (e)(2) of this section into:
    (i) Net realized gain (loss) (as reported on SBA Form 468) on 
Earmarked Assets (``EGL''); and
    (ii) The remainder (``R'').
    (4) Your Earmarked Profit (Loss) equals:

EGL + (R  x  Earmarked Asset Ratio)

    (f) How to compute your cumulative Earmarked Profit (Loss). Sum your 
Earmarked Profit (Loss) for all fiscal years and for any interim period 
following the end of your last fiscal year. The total is your cumulative 
Earmarked Profit (Loss), which you must

[[Page 74]]

use in the Prioritized Payment computations under Sec. 107.1520.

<R05>
Sec. 107.1520  How a Licensee computes and allocates Prioritized Payments to SBA.

    This section tells you how to compute Prioritized Payments, 
Adjustments and Charges on Participating Securities and determine the 
amounts you must pay. To distribute these amounts, see Sec. 107.1540.
    (a) How to compute Prioritized Payments and Adjustments--(1) 
Prioritized Payments. For a full fiscal year, the Prioritized Payment on 
an outstanding Participating Security equals the Redemption Price times 
the related Trust Certificate Rate. For an interim period, you must 
prorate the annual Prioritized Payment. If your Participating Security 
was sold to a short-term investor in accordance with Sec. 107.1240, the 
Prioritized Payment for the short-term period equals the Redemption 
Price times the short-term rate.
    (2) Adjustments. Compute Adjustments using paragraph (f) of this 
section.
    (3) Charges. Compute Charges in accordance with Sec. 107.1130(d)(2).
    (b) Licensee's obligation to pay Prioritized Payments, Adjustments 
and Charges. You are obligated to pay Prioritized Payments, Adjustments 
and Charges only if you have profit as determined in paragraph (d) of 
this section.
    (1) Prioritized Payments that you must pay (or have already paid) 
because you have sufficient profit are ``Earned Prioritized Payments''.
    (2) Prioritized Payments that have not become payable because you 
lack sufficient profit are ``Accumulated Prioritized Payments''. Treat 
all Prioritized Payments as ``Accumulated'' until they become ``Earned'' 
under this section.
    (3) Adjustments (computed under paragraph (f) of this section) and 
Charges (computed under Sec. 107.1130(d)(2)) are ``earned'' according to 
the same criteria applied to Prioritized Payments.
    (c) How to keep track of Prioritized Payments. You must establish 
three accounts to record your Accumulated and Earned Prioritized 
Payments:
    (1) Accumulation Account. The Accumulation Account is a memorandum 
account. Its balance represents your Accumulated Prioritized Payments, 
unearned Adjustments and unearned Charges.
    (2) Distribution Account. The Distribution Account is a liability 
account. Its balance represents your unpaid Earned Prioritized Payments, 
earned Adjustments and earned Charges.
    (3) Earned Payments Account. The Earned Payments Account is a 
memorandum account. Each time you add to the Distribution Account 
balance, add the same amount to the Earned Payments Account. Its balance 
represents your total (paid and unpaid) Earned Prioritized Payments, 
earned Adjustments and earned Charges.
    (d) How to determine your profit for Prioritized Payment purposes. 
As of the end of each fiscal year and any interim period for which you 
want to make a Distribution:
    (1) Bring the Accumulation Account up to date by adding to it all 
Prioritized Payments and Charges through the end of the appropriate 
fiscal period.
    (2) Determine whether you have profit for the purposes of this 
section by doing the following computation:
    (i) Cumulative Earmarked Profit (Loss) under Sec. 107.1510(f); minus
    (ii) The Earned Payments Account balance; minus
    (iii) All Distributions previously made under Secs. 107.1550, 
107.1560 and 107.1570(a); minus
    (iv) Any Profit Participation previously allocated to SBA under 
Sec. 107.1530, but not yet distributed.
    (3) The amount computed in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, if 
greater than zero, is your profit. If the amount is zero or less, you 
have no profit.
    (4) If you have a profit, continue with paragraph (e) of this 
section. Otherwise, continue with paragraph (f) of this section.
    (e) Allocating Prioritized Payments to the Distribution Account. (1) 
If you have a profit under paragraph (d) of this section, determine the 
lesser of:

[[Page 75]]

    (i) Your profit; or
    (ii) The balance in your Accumulation Account.
    (2) Subtract the result in paragraph (e)(1) of this section from the 
Accumulation Account and add it to the Distribution Account and the 
Earned Payments Account.
    (f) How to compute Adjustments. You must compute Adjustments as of 
the end of each fiscal year if you have a balance greater than zero in 
either your Accumulation Account or your Distribution Account, after 
giving effect to any Distribution that will be made no later than the 
second Payment Date following the fiscal year end.
    (1) Determine the combined average Accumulation Account and 
Distribution Account balances for the fiscal year, assuming that 
Prioritized Payments accumulate on a daily basis without compounding.
    (2) Multiply the average balance computed in paragraph (f)(1) of 
this section by the average of the Trust Certificate Rates for all the 
Participating Securities poolings during the fiscal year.
    (3) Add the amounts computed in this paragraph (f) to your 
Accumulation Account.
    (g) Licensee's obligation to pay Prioritized Payments after 
redeeming Participating Securities. This paragraph (g) applies if you 
have redeemed all your Participating Securities, but you still hold 
Earmarked Assets and still have a balance in your Accumulation Account.
    (1) You must continue to perform all the procedures in this section 
as of the end of each fiscal quarter and prior to making any 
Distribution. You must distribute any Earned Prioritized Payments, 
earned Adjustments and earned Charges in accordance with Sec. 107.1540.
    (2) After you dispose of all your Earmarked Assets and make any 
required Distributions in accordance with Sec. 107.1540, your obligation

Sec. 107.1530  How a Licensee computes SBA's Profit Participation.

    This section tells you how to compute SBA's Profit Participation. 
Profit Participation is included in the Distributions you make to SBA 
under Secs. 107.1550 and 107.1560.
    (a) How to compute Profit Participation. Profit Participation equals 
your ``Base'' times your ``Profit Participation Rate'' (if the Base is 
zero or less, you do not owe SBA Profit Participation). Compute the Base 
using paragraph (c) of this section and the Profit Participation Rate 
using paragraphs (d) through (g) of this section. You must compute your 
Earmarked Profit (Loss) under Sec. 107.1510 and your Prioritized 
Payments and Adjustments under Sec. 107.1520 before you can compute 
Profit Participation.
    (b) How to keep track of Profit Participation. You must establish a 
Profit Participation Account to record your computations under this 
section and payments under Secs. 107.1550 and 107.1560. Its balance 
represents your unpaid Profit Participation.
    (c) How to compute the Base. As of the end of each fiscal year and 
any year-to-date interim period for which you want to make a 
Distribution, compute your Base using the following formula:


B = EP-PPA-UL

where:
    B = Base.
    EP = Earmarked Profit (Loss) for the period from Sec. 107.1510.
    PPA = Prioritized Payments for the period from Sec. 107.1520(a)(1), 
Adjustments (if applicable) from Sec. 107.1520(f), and Charges (if 
applicable) from Sec. 107.1130(d)(2).
    UL = ``Unused Loss'' from prior periods as determined in this 
paragraph (c).

    (1) If the Base computed as of the end of your previous fiscal year 
(your ``Previous Base'') was less than zero, your Unused Loss equals 
your Previous Base.
    (2) If your Previous Base was zero or greater, your Unused Loss 
equals zero, with the following exception: If you made an interim 
Distribution of Profit Participation during your previous fiscal year, 
and your Previous Base was lower than the interim Base on which

[[Page 76]]

your Distribution was computed, then your Unused Loss equals the 
difference between the interim Base and the Previous Base. For example, 
assume you are computing your Base as of December 31, 1997, your fiscal 
year end. Your Previous Base, computed as of December 31, 1996, was 
$3,000,000. During 1996, you made an interim Distribution which was 
computed on a Base of $3,500,000 as of June 30, 1996. The $500,000 
difference between the 1996 interim and year-end Bases would be carried 
forward as Unused Loss in the computation of your Base as of December 
31, 1997.
    (3) If you had no Participating Securities outstanding as of the end 
of your last fiscal year, you may request SBA's approval to treat your 
Undistributed Net Realized Loss, as reported on SBA Form 468 for that 
year, as Unused Loss. If you did not file SBA Form 468 because you were 
not yet licensed as of the end of your last fiscal year, you may request 
SBA's approval to treat pre-licensing losses as Unused Loss.
    (d) How to compute the Profit Participation Rate. You must determine 
your Profit Participation Rate each time you compute a Base that is 
greater than zero. Compute the Rate by following the steps in paragraphs 
(e) through (g) of this section.
    (e) Compute the ``PLC ratio''. (1) General rule. The ``PLC ratio'' 
is the highest ratio of outstanding Participating Securities to 
Leverageable Capital that you have ever attained.
    (2) Exception. You may reduce the ratio computed under paragraph 
(e)(1) of this section if you have increased your Leverageable Capital 
above its highest previous level. The increase must have taken place at 
least 120 days before the date as of which your Base is computed. In 
addition, the increase must have been expressly provided for in a plan 
of operations submitted to and approved by SBA in writing, or must be 
the result of the takedown of commitments or the conversion of non-cash 
assets that were included in your Private Capital. If these conditions 
are satisfied, compute your reduced PLC ratio as follows:
    (i) Divide the highest dollar amount of Participating Securities you 
have ever had outstanding by your increased Leverageable Capital.
    (ii) If the result in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section is lower 
than your PLC ratio currently in effect, such result will become your 
new PLC ratio.
    (f) Compute the Profit Participation Rate (before indexing). Compute 
the Profit Participation Rate (before indexing) using the table in this 
paragraph (f). Then go to paragraph (g) of this section to determine 
whether to index the Profit Participation Rate.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
     If your PLC ratio is:       Then your Profit Participation Rate is:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 or less......................  9% x PLC Ratio.
More than 1....................  9%+[3% x (PLC ratio-1)].
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (g) Indexing the Profit Participation Rate. The Profit Participation 
Rate is indexed, up or down, to the yield-to-maturity on Treasury bonds 
with a remaining term of ten (10) years (the ``Treasury Rate''). You 
must perform the indexing procedures in this paragraph (g) unless the 
Treasury Rate was exactly 8 percent on every date that you issued 
Participating Securities.
    (1) Licensees that have issued Participating Securities on only one 
occasion. Determine the Treasury Rate for the date you issued your 
Participating Security. Adjust the Profit Participation Rate from 
paragraph (f) of this section by the percentage difference between the 
Treasury Rate and 8 percent. For example, assume that you issued 
Participating Securities when the Treasury Rate was 10 percent. The 
percentage difference between 10 percent and 8 percent is 25 percent. If 
you had a PLC ratio of 1, the Profit Participation Rate before indexing 
would be 9 percent. You would increase this rate by 25 percent, giving 
you a Profit Participation Rate of 11.25 percent.
    (2) Licensees that have issued Participating Securities on more than 
one occasion. Determine the Treasury Rate for each of the dates you 
issued Participating Securities.
    (i) Compute an average of all such Treasury Rates, weighted to 
reflect the dollar amount of each issuance (ignoring any redemptions) 
and the number of days from the date of each issuance to the date as of 
which you are computing the Profit Participation Rate.

[[Page 77]]

    Example to paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section. If you issued $10 
million of Participating Securities on the 60th day of Fiscal Year 1 
when the Treasury Rate was 8 percent, and another $15 million on the 
100th day of Fiscal Year 3 when the Treasury Rate was 10 percent, then 
the weighted average Treasury Rate computed as of the end of Fiscal Year 
3 would be 8.55 percent. [Days elapsed since first issuance of 
Participating Securities = 1,035; days elapsed since second issuance of 
Participating Securities = 265; weighted amount of first issuance = 
$10,000,000  x  1,035/1,035 = $10,000,000; weighted amount of second 
issuance = $15,000,000  x  265/1035 = $3,840,579; weighted average 
amount of Participating Securities issued = $10,000,000 + $3,840,579 = 
$13,840,579; weighted average Treasury Rate= {(.08  x  $10,000,000) + 
(.10  x  $3,840,579)} / $13,840,579 = 8.55%]
    (ii) Adjust the Profit Participation Rate from paragraph (f) of this 
section by the percentage difference between the weighted average 
Treasury Rate and 8 percent. In the example given in paragraph (g)(2)(i) 
of this section, if the PLC ratio were equal to 2, the Profit 
Participation Rate for the fiscal year would be 12.83 percent. 
[{((.0855-.08) <divide>.08) + 1}  x  .12  x  100 = 12.83%]
    (h) Computing SBA's Profit Participation. If the Base from paragraph 
(c) of this section is greater than zero, you must compute SBA's Profit 
Participation as follows:
    (1) Multiply the Base from paragraph (c) of this section by the 
Profit Participation Rate from paragraph (g) of this section.
    (2) If your last Profit Participation computation was for an interim 
period during the same fiscal year and used a higher Profit 
Participation Rate than the Rate you just used in paragraph (h)(1) of 
this section, you must adjust the amount computed in paragraph (h)(1) of 
this section as follows:
    (i) Determine the difference between the Profit Participation Rate 
you just used in paragraph (h)(1) of this section and the Rate used in 
your previous computation;
    (ii) Multiply the difference by the Base from your last Profit 
Participation computation; and
    (iii) Add the result to the amount you computed in paragraph (h)(1) 
of this section.
    (3) Reduce the Profit Participation computed in paragraphs (h)(1) 
and (h)(2) of this section by any amounts of Profit Participation that 
you distributed or reserved for distribution to SBA, or its designated 
agent or Trustee, for any previous interim period(s) during the fiscal 
year. The result is SBA's Profit Participation (unless it is less than 
zero, in which case SBA's Profit Participation is zero).
    (i) Allocation of Profit Participation. Before any Distribution and 
in any case within 120 days following the end of your fiscal year, you 
must add the amount of Profit Participation computed under this 
Sec. 107.1530 to the Profit Participation Account. You must reserve 
funds equal to this amount for distribution to SBA, or its designated 
agent or Trustee; you may not reinvest these funds or use them for any 
other purpose.

Sec. 107.1540  Distributions by Licensee--Prioritized Payments and Adjustments.

    After you compute Prioritized Payments and Adjustments under 
Sec. 107.1520, you must distribute them in accordance with this 
Sec. 107.1540. You must notify SBA of any planned distribution under 
this section 10 business days before the distribution date, unless SBA 
permits otherwise.
    (a) Requirement to distribute Prioritized Payments and Adjustments. 
This paragraph (a) applies only if you satisfy the liquidity requirement 
in Sec. 107.1505. All Distributions under this paragraph (a) go to SBA 
or its designated agent or trustee.
    (1) You must distribute the balance in your Distribution Account 
from Sec. 107.1520 annually on the first or second Payment Date 
following your fiscal year end, and on any date when you are making any 
other Distribution.
    (2) You may distribute all or part of the balance in your 
Distribution Account on any Payment Date regardless of whether you are 
making any other Distribution on that date.

[[Page 78]]

    (b) Additional requirement for Licensees with undistributed 
Prioritized Payments. This paragraph (b) applies if you do not 
distribute the full amount in your Distribution Account by the second 
Payment Date following the end of your fiscal year. At the end of each 
fiscal quarter, until you reduce the balance in your Distribution 
Account to zero, you must:
    (1) Do all the steps in Sec. 107.1520; and
    (2) Distribute the balance in your Distribution Account on the next 
Payment Date following the end of your fiscal quarter, provided you 
satisfy the liquidity requirement in Sec. 107.1505.

Sec. 107.1550  Distributions by Licensee--permitted ``tax Distributions'' to private investors and SBA.

    If you have outstanding Participating Securities or Earmarked 
Assets, and you are a limited partnership, ``S Corporation'', or 
equivalent pass-through entity for tax purposes, you may make an annual 
``tax Distribution'' to your investors, whether or not they have an 
actual tax liability. SBA receives a share of any tax Distribution you 
make. This section tells you when you may make a ``tax Distribution'' 
and how to compute it. You must notify SBA of any planned distribution 
under this section 10 business days before the distribution date, unless 
SBA permits otherwise.
    (a) Conditions for making a tax Distribution. You may make a tax 
Distribution only if:
    (1) You have paid all your Prioritized Payments, Adjustments, and 
Charges, so that the balance in both your Distribution Account and your 
Accumulation Account is zero (see Sec. 107.1520).
    (2) You satisfy the liquidity requirement in Sec. 107.1505.
    (3) The tax Distribution does not exceed your Retained Earnings 
Available for Distribution.
    (4) The tax Distribution does not exceed the Maximum Tax Liability 
from paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) How to compute the Maximum Tax Liability. (1) Compute your 
Maximum Tax Liability for a full fiscal year only. Use the following 
formula:


M=(TOI  x  HRO) + (TCG  x  HRC)

where:
    M=Maximum Tax Liability.
    TOI=Net ordinary income allocated to your partners or other owners 
for Federal income tax purposes for the fiscal year immediately 
preceding the Distribution, excluding Prioritized Payments allocated to 
SBA.
    HRO=The highest combined marginal Federal and State income tax rate 
for corporations or individuals on ordinary income, determined in 
accordance with paragraphs (b)(2) through (b)(4) of this section.
    TCG=Net capital gains allocated to your partners or other owners for 
Federal income tax purposes for the fiscal year immediately preceding 
the Distribution, excluding Prioritized Payments allocated to SBA.
    HRC=The highest combined marginal Federal and State income tax rate 
for corporations or individuals on capital gains, determined in 
accordance with paragraphs (b)(2) through (b)(4) of this section.

    (2) You may compute the highest combined marginal Federal and State 
income tax rate on ordinary income and capital gains using either 
individual or corporate rates. However, you must apply the same type of 
rate, either individual or corporate, to both ordinary income and 
capital gains.
    (3) In determining the combined Federal and State income tax rate, 
you must assume that State income taxes are deductible from Federal 
income taxes. For example, if the Federal tax rate was 35 percent and 
the State tax rate was 5 percent, the combined tax rate would be [35% 
x  (1-.05)] + 5% = 38.25%.
    (4) For purposes of this paragraph (b), the ``State income tax'' is 
that of the State where your principal place of business is located, and 
does not include any local income taxes.
    (c) SBA's share of the tax Distribution. (1) SBA's percentage share 
of the tax Distribution is equal to the Profit Participation Rate 
computed under Sec. 107.1530.

[[Page 79]]

    (2) SBA may direct you to pay its share of the tax Distribution to 
its designated agent or Trustee.
    (3) SBA will apply its share of the tax Distribution in the order 
set forth in Sec. 107.1560(g).
    (d) Paying a tax Distribution. You may make a tax Distribution only 
on the first or second Payment Date following the end of your fiscal 
year or, if your fiscal year end is December 31, during the period 
beginning March 1 and ending April 15.

Sec. 107.1560  Distributions by Licensee--required Distributions to private investors and SBA.

    You must make Distributions under this Sec. 107.1560 if you have 
outstanding Participating Securities or Earmarked Assets and you satisfy 
the conditions in paragraph (a) of this section. Distributions under 
this section are determined as of the end of each fiscal year. You must 
notify SBA of any planned distribution under this section 10 business 
days before the distribution date, unless SBA permits otherwise.
    (a) Conditions for making Distributions. Distributions under this 
section are subject to the following conditions:
    (1) You must have paid all Prioritized Payments, Adjustments and 
Charges, so that the balance in both your Distribution Account and your 
Accumulation Account is zero (see Secs. 107.1520 and 107.1540).
    (2) You must have made any permitted tax Distribution that you 
choose to make under Sec. 107.1550.
    (3) You must satisfy the liquidity requirement in Sec. 107.1505.
    (4) The amount you distribute under this section must not exceed 
your remaining Retained Earnings Available for Distribution.
    (b) Total amount you must distribute. Unless SBA permits otherwise, 
the total amount you must distribute equals the result (if greater than 
zero) of the following computation:
    (1) Your Retained Earnings Available for Distribution as of the end 
of your fiscal year, after giving effect to any Distribution under 
Secs. 107.1540 and 107.1550; minus
    (2) All previous Distributions under this section and 
Sec. 107.1570(a) that were applied as redemptions or repayments of 
Leverage; plus
    (3) All previous Distributions under Sec. 107.1570(b) that reduced 
your Retained Earnings Available for Distribution.
    (c) When you must make Distributions. You must make the required 
Distributions on either the first or second Payment Date following the 
end of your fiscal year.
    (d) Effect of Distributions on Retained Earnings Available for 
Distribution. Distributions under this Sec. 107.1560 have the following 
effect on your Retained Earnings Available for Distribution:
    (1) All Distributions to private investors reduce Retained Earnings 
Available for Distribution.
    (2) Distributions to SBA, or its designated agent or Trustee, reduce 
Retained Earnings Available for Distribution if they are applied as 
payments of Profit Participation or distributions on Preferred 
Securities (see paragraph (g) of this section).
    (3) Distributions to SBA, or its designated agent or Trustee, do not 
reduce Retained Earnings Available for Distribution if they are applied 
as a repayment or redemption of Leverage (see paragraph (g) of this 
section).
    (e) SBA's share of the total Distribution. Use the following table 
to determine the percentage share of the total Distribution (from 
paragraph (b) of this section) that goes to SBA (or its designated agent 
or Trustee):

              SBA's Percentage Share of Total Distribution
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 If your ratio of Leverage to Leverageable   Then SBA's percentage share
  Capital as of the fiscal period end is:      of the Distribution is:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Over 200%.................................  [Leverage / (Leverage +
                                             Leverageable Capital)]  x
                                             100.
Over 100% but not over 200%...............  50%.
100% or less..............................  Profit Participation Rate
                                             from Sec.  107.1530.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (f) Exceptions to the Distribution requirement. (1) With SBA's prior 
written approval, you may withhold from distribution reasonable reserves 
necessary to protect your investments or relative position in Loans and 
Investments and to meet contingent liabilities.

[[Page 80]]

    (i) If you submit a written request for SBA approval, you may 
consider it approved unless SBA notifies you otherwise within 30 days 
from receipt.
    (ii) Reserves that you withhold from distribution may not be used to 
make investments in additional portfolio companies.
    (iii) Withholding of reserves under this paragraph (f)(1) is not a 
``payment failure'' in violation of Sec. 107.1820(e)(6).
    (2) SBA may restrict Distributions under this Sec. 107.1560 if SBA 
determines that the value of your assets is materially overstated. SBA 
must give you notice of such a determination in advance of your proposed 
Distribution.
    (g) How SBA will apply your Distributions. Your Distributions to SBA 
(or its designated agent or Trustee) under this Sec. 107.1560 will be 
applied in the following order:
    (1) First, to Profit Participation;
    (2) Second, to the extent there remain any Retained Earnings 
Available for Distribution, to distributions on Preferred Securities;
    (3) Third, as a redemption of Participating Securities in order of 
issue;
    (4) Fourth, as a redemption of Preferred Securities; and
    (5) Fifth, as the repayment of principal of any outstanding 
Debentures, with such repayment to be made into escrow on terms and 
conditions SBA determines.

Sec. 107.1570  Distributions by Licensee--optional Distribution to private investors and SBA.

    If you have outstanding Participating Securities or Earmarked 
Assets, you may make two types of optional Distributions under this 
Sec. 107.1570: quarterly Distributions determined the same way as the 
required annual Distributions in Sec. 107.1560, and Distributions 
allocated between SBA and your private investors in proportion to the 
capital contributions of each. You must notify SBA of any planned 
distribution under this section 10 business days before the distribution 
date, unless SBA permits otherwise.
    (a) Quarterly Distributions subject to conditions in Sec. 107.1560. 
(1) You may make Distributions under this paragraph (a) as of the end of 
any fiscal quarter, giving SBA (or its designated agent or Trustee) a 
percentage share determined under Sec. 107.1560(e).
    (2) Such Distributions are subject to all the provisions in 
Sec. 107.1560 (a)(1), (a)(3), (a)(4), (d), (f)(2), and (g).
    (3) You may make such Distributions only on the next Payment Date 
following the end of your fiscal quarter.
    (4) The total amount of such Distributions may not exceed the result 
of the following computation:
    (i) Your Retained Earnings Available for Distribution as of the end 
of your fiscal quarter; minus
    (ii) All previous Distributions under this paragraph (a) or 
Sec. 107.1560 that were applied as redemptions or repayments of 
Leverage; plus
    (iii) All previous Distributions under paragraph (b) of this section 
that reduced your Retained Earnings Available for Distribution.
    (b) Other optional Distributions. On any Payment Date, you may make 
additional Distributions to your private investors and to SBA (or its 
designated agent or Trustee) under this paragraph (b).
    (1) Conditions for making a Distribution. You may make a 
Distribution under this paragraph (b) only if:
    (i) You have distributed all Earned Prioritized Payments, earned 
Adjustments, and earned Charges, so that the balance in your 
Distribution Account is zero (see Sec. 107.1520).
    (ii) You have distributed all Profit Participation computed under 
Sec. 107.1530 which you are required to distribute under Sec. 107.1560 
or permitted to distribute under paragraph (a) of this section, as 
appropriate, and you have made all required Distributions under 
Sec. 107.1560.
    (iii) You satisfy the liquidity requirement in Sec. 107.1505 or 
obtain SBA's prior written approval of the Distribution.
    (iv) You do not have a condition of Capital Impairment.
    (v) The Distribution does not reduce your Regulatory Capital 
(excluding commitments from Institutional Investors) below the minimum 
required under Sec. 107.210, unless SBA approves the reduction as part 
of a plan of liquidation.

[[Page 81]]

    (vi) The Distribution does not cause you to have excess Leverage 
contrary to section 303 of the Act.
    (2) SBA's share of Distribution. (i) If your Capital Impairment 
Percentage under Sec. 107.1840 is zero, SBA's percentage share of any 
Distribution under this paragraph (b) equals:

[Leverage/(Leverage + Leverageable Capital)]  x  100

In this formula, use Leverage and Leverageable Capital as of the date of 
the Distribution, after giving effect to any Distribution under 
Sec. 107.1560 and paragraph (a) of this section.

    (ii) If your Capital Impairment Percentage under Sec. 107.1840 is 
greater than zero, you must modify the formula in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of 
this section by replacing Leverageable Capital with:

Leverageable Capital  x  (100% - CIP)

where ``CIP'' is your Capital Impairment Percentage or 100 percent, 
whichever is less.

    (3) How SBA will apply Distributions. Any amounts you distribute to 
SBA, or its designated agent or Trustee, under this paragraph (b) will 
be applied as a repayment or redemption of Leverage in the order set 
forth in Sec. 107.1560 (g)(3) through (g)(5).
    (4) Effect of Distributions on Retained Earnings Available for 
Distribution. Any amounts you distribute to non-SBA investors under this 
paragraph (b) must reduce your Retained Earnings Available for 
Distribution to zero before reducing your Private Capital.
    (5) Permitted exception to Sec. 107.585. You may make any 
Distribution permitted by this paragraph (b), even if the result is a 
reduction in your Regulatory Capital that would otherwise be prohibited 
under Sec. 107.585.

    (3) If your Distribution includes an amount which SBA will apply as

Sec. 107.1580  Special rules for In-Kind Distributions by Licensees.

    (a) In-Kind Distributions. A Distribution under Secs. 107.1540, 
107.1560 or 107.1570 may consist of securities (an ``In-Kind 
Distribution''). Such a Distribution must satisfy the conditions in this 
paragraph (a).
    (1) You may distribute only securities that are Publicly Traded and 
Marketable at the time of the Distribution.
    (2) You must distribute each security pro-rata to all investors and 
to SBA or its designated agent or Trustee, based on the amounts that 
each party would receive if the Distribution were in cash.
    (3) You must impute a gain (loss) on each security being distributed 
as if it were being sold, using the value of the security as of the 
declaration date of the Distribution (if you are a Corporate Licensee) 
or the distribution date (if you are a Partnership Licensee).

[[Page 82]]

    (4) You must deposit SBA's share of the securities being distributed 
with the CRA, who will select a Disposition Agent (a person who is 
knowledgeable about and proficient in the marketing of thinly traded 
securities). As an alternative, if you agree, SBA may direct you to 
dispose of its share. In this case, you must promptly remit the proceeds 
to SBA.
    (b) In-Kind Distributions after Licensee has redeemed all 
Participating Securities. This paragraph (b) applies from the time you 
redeem all your Participating Securities until you dispose of all your 
Earmarked Assets.
    (1) You may make an In-Kind Distribution of an Earmarked Asset only 
if you pay SBA the lower of:
    (i) An amount equal to the Unrealized Appreciation on the asset; or
    (ii) The full amount of your Accumulated Prioritized Payments and 
unpaid Adjustments.
    (2) You must obtain SBA's prior written approval of any In-Kind 
Distribution of an Earmarked Asset that is not Publicly Traded and 
Marketable, specifically including approval of the valuation of the 
asset.

Sec. 107.1585  Exchange of Debentures for Participating Securities.

    You may, in SBA's discretion, retire a Debenture through the 
issuance of Participating Securities. To do so, you must:
    (a) Obtain SBA's approval to issue Participating Securities;
    (b) Pay all unpaid accrued interest on the Debenture, plus any 
applicable prepayment penalties, fees, and other charges;
    (c) Have outstanding Equity Capital Investments (at cost) equal to 
the amount of the Debenture being refinanced; and
    (d) Classify all your existing Loans and Investments as Earmarked

Sec. 107.1590  Special rules for companies licensed on or before March 31, 1993.

    This section applies to companies licensed on or before March 31, 
1993 that apply to issue Participating Securities.
    (a) Election to exclude pre-existing portfolio. You may choose to 
exclude all (but not a portion) of your Loans and Investments as of 
March 31, 1993, from classification as Earmarked Assets if:
    (1) The proceeds of your first issuance of Participating Securities 
are not used to refinance outstanding Debentures (see Sec. 107.1585(a)). 
SBA will consider payment or prepayment of any outstanding Debenture to 
be a refinancing unless you demonstrate to SBA's satisfaction that you 
can pay the Debenture principal without relying on the proceeds of the 
Participating Securities.
    (2) SBA, in its sole discretion, approves the exclusion.
    (b) Treatment of pre-existing portfolio if not excluded. If you do 
not choose to exclude your Loans and Investments as of March 31, 1993, 
they will be Earmarked Assets for all purposes.
    (c) Requirements for Licensee's first issuance of Participating 
Securities. When you apply for your first issuance of Participating 
Securities, you must comply with the following:
    (1) For each of your Loans and Investments, you must submit:
    (i) The most recent annual report (or fiscal year-end financial 
statements) and the most recent interim financial statements of the 
Small Business; and
    (ii) Your valuation reports on the Small Business, prepared as of 
the end of each of your last three fiscal years. If you have applied for 
Participating Securities on the basis of interim financial statements, 
you must also submit a valuation report as of your interim financial 
statement date.
    (2) If you have negative Undistributed Net Realized Earnings and/or 
a net Unrealized Loss on Securities Held, SBA may require you to undergo 
a quasi-reorganization in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles.
    (3) If your financial statements accompanying the Participating 
Securities application are for an interim period, you must have your 
SBA-approved independent public accountant perform a limited-scope audit 
of the statements. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(3), ``limited 
scope audit'' means auditing procedures sufficient

[[Page 83]]

to enable the independent public accountant to express an opinion on the 
Statement of Financial Position and the accompanying Schedule of Loans 
and Investments.

 Funding Leverage by Use of SBA-Guaranteed Trust Certificates (``TCs'')


<R05>
Sec. 107.1600  SBA authority to issue and guarantee Trust Certificates.

    (a) Authorization. Sections 319(a) and (b) of the Act authorize SBA 
or its CRA to issue TCs, and SBA to guarantee the timely payment of the 
principal and interest thereon. Any guarantee by SBA of such TC is 
limited to the principal and interest due on the Debentures or the 
Redemption Price of and Prioritized Payments on Participating Securities 
in any Trust or Pool backing such TC. The full faith and credit of the 
United States is pledged to the payment of all amounts due under the 
guarantee of any TC.
    (b) Periodic exercise of authority. SBA will issue guarantees of 
Debentures and Participating Securities under section 303 and of TCs 
under section 319 of the Act at six month intervals, or at shorter 
intervals, taking into account the amount and number of such guarantees 
or TCs.
    (c) SBA authority to arrange public or private fundings of Leverage. 
SBA in its discretion may arrange for public or private financing under 
its guarantee authority. Such financing arranged by SBA may be 
accomplished by the sale of individual Debentures or Participating 
Securities, aggregations of Debentures or Participating Securities, or 
Pools or Trusts of Debentures or Participating Securities.
    (d) Pass-through provisions. TCs shall provide for a pass-through to 
their holders of all amounts of principal and interest paid on the 
Debentures, or the Redemption Price of and Prioritized Payments on the 
Participating Securities, in the Pool or Trust against which they are 
issued.
    (e) Formation of a Pool or Trust holding Leverage Securities. SBA 
shall approve the formation of each Pool or Trust. SBA may, in its 
discretion, establish the size of the Pools and their composition, the 
interest rate on the TCs issued against Trusts or Pools, fees, 
discounts, premiums and other charges made in connection with the Pools, 
Trusts, and TCs, and any other characteristics of a Pool or Trust it 
deems appropriate.

<R05>
Sec. 107.1610  Effect of prepayment or early redemption of Leverage on a Trust Certificate.

    (a) The rights, if any, of a Licensee to prepay any Debenture or 
make early redemption of any Participating Security are established by 
the terms of such securities, and no such right is created or denied by 
the regulations in this part.
    (b) SBA's rights to purchase or prepay any Debenture without premium 
are established by the terms of the Guaranty Agreement relating to the 
Debenture. SBA's rights to redeem, at any time, any Participating 
Security without premium are established by the terms of the Guaranty 
Agreement relating to the Participating Security.
    (c) Any prepayment of a Debenture or early redemption of a 
Participating Security pursuant to the terms of the Guaranty Agreement 
relating to such securities, shall reduce the SBA guarantee of timely 
payment of principal and interest on a TC in proportion to the amount of 
principal or Redemption Price that such prepaid Debenture or redeemed 
Participating Security represents in the Trust or Pool backing such TC.
    (d) SBA shall be discharged from its guarantee obligation to the 
holder or holders of any TC, or any successor or transferee of such 
holder, to the extent of any such prepayment, whether or not such 
successor or transferee shall have notice of any such prepayment.
    (e) Interest on prepaid Debentures and Prioritized Payments on 
Participating Securities shall accrue only through the date of such 
voluntary prepayment or SBA payment, as the case may be.
    (f) In the event that all Debentures or Participating Securities 
constituting a Trust or Pool are prepaid, the TCs backed by such Trust 
or Pool shall

[[Page 84]]

be redeemed by payment of the unpaid principal and interest on the TCs; 
Provided, however, that in the case of the prepayment of a Debenture 
pursuant to the provisions of the Guaranty Agreement relating to the 
Debenture, the CRA shall pass through pro rata to the holders of the TCs 
any such prepayments including any prepayment penalty paid by the 
obligor Licensee pursuant to the terms of the Debenture.

Your Articles must include the provisions of this Sec. 107.1820 as a 
condition to SBA's purchase of Preferred Securities or guarantee of 
Participating Securities and for as long as you own Earmarked Assets. 
Preferred Securities issued before April 25, 1994 continue to be 
governed by the remedies in effect at the time of their issuance.
    (b) Removal Conditions. Upon the occurrence (as determined by SBA) 
of any of the following conditions (``Removal Conditions''), SBA may 
avail itself of one or more of the remedies in paragraph (d) of this

    (1) Insolvency or extreme Capital Impairment. You become equitably 
or legally insolvent, or have a Capital Impairment Percentage of 100 
percent or more (``extreme Capital Impairment'')

[[Page 89]]

and have not cured such Capital Impairment within the time limits set by 
SBA in writing. In this regard:
    (i) You are not considered to have a condition of extreme Capital 
Impairment during the first eight years following your first issuance of 
Participating Securities.
    (ii) This paragraph (b)(1) does not give you an additional 
opportunity to cure if you have already had an opportunity to cure your 
Capital Impairment under paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
    (2) Voluntary assignment. You make a voluntary assignment for the 
benefit of creditors.
    (3) Bankruptcy. You begin any bankruptcy or reorganization 
proceeding, receivership, dissolution or other similar creditors' rights 
proceeding, or such action is initiated against you and is not dismissed 
within 60 days.
    (4) Transfer of Control. You violate Sec. 107.475 and/or willfully 
violate Sec. 107.410, and such violation results in a transfer of 
Control.
    (5) Fraud. You commit a fraudulent act which causes serious 
detriment to SBA's position as a guarantor or investor.
    (6) Fraudulent transfers. You make any transfer or incur any 
obligation that is fraudulent under the terms of 11 USC 548.
    (c) Contingent Removal Conditions. Upon the occurrence (as 
determined by SBA) of any of the following conditions (``Contingent 
Removal Conditions''), SBA may avail itself of one or more of the 
remedies in paragraph (d) of this section, but only if you fail to 
remove the person(s) SBA identifies as responsible for such occurrence 
and/or cure such occurrence to SBA's satisfaction within a time period 
determined by SBA (but not less than 15 days):
    (1) Willful conflicts of interest. You willfully violate 
Sec. 107.730.
    (2) Willful or repeated noncompliance. You willfully or repeatedly 
violate one or more of the substantive provisions of the Act,

the following rights, and you consent to SBA's exercise of any or all of 
such rights:
    (1) With respect to a Corporate Licensee, upon written notice, to 
require you to replace, with individuals approved by SBA, one or more of 
your officers and/or such number of directors as is sufficient to 
constitute a majority of your board of directors; or
    (2) With respect to a Partnership Licensee, upon written notice, to

and/or
    (3) With respect to either a Corporate or Partnership Licensee, to 
the appointment of SBA or its designee as your receiver under section 
311(c) of the Act for the purpose of continuing your operations. The 
appointment of a receiver to liquidate a Licensee is not within such 
consent, but is governed instead by the relevant provisions of the Act.
    (e) Restricted Operations Conditions. Upon the occurrence (as 
determined by SBA) of any of the following conditions (``Restricted 
Operations Conditions''), SBA may avail itself of any of the remedies in

of SBA, you incur Management Expenses in excess of those permitted under 
Sec. 107.520.
    (6) Failure to make payment. You fail to pay any amounts due under 
Preferred Securities or required by Secs. 107.1500 through 107.1590, 
unless otherwise permitted by SBA.

section 310(c) of the Act, or any substantive regulation promulgated 
under the Act.
    (8) Failure to maintain diversity. You fail to maintain diversity 
between management and ownership as required by Sec. 107.150, if 
applicable to you.
    (9) Failure to meet investment requirements. You fail to make the 
amount of Equity Capital Investments required for Participating 
Securities (Sec. 107.1500(b)(4)), if applicable to you; or you fail to

you. In determining whether you have met the maintenance requirements in 
Sec. 107.1160(c) or (d), SBA will disregard any prepayment, sale, or 
disposition of Venture Capital Financings, any increase in Leverageable 
Capital, and any receipt of additional Leverage, within 120 days prior 
to the end of your fiscal year.
    (10) Nonperformance. You violate or fail to perform one or more of 
the terms and conditions of any Participating Security or Preferred 
Security or of any agreement with or condition imposed by SBA in its 
administration of the Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder.
    (11) Noncooperation under paragraph (g) of this section. You fail to 
take appropriate steps, satisfactory to SBA, to accomplish such action 
as SBA may have required under paragraph (g) of this section.
    (f) SBA remedies for Restricted Operations Conditions. Upon the

shall have the following rights, and you consent to SBA's exercise of 
any or all of such rights:
    (1) To prohibit you from making any additional investments except

    (2) Until all Leverage is redeemed and amounts due are paid, to 
prohibit Distributions by you to any party other than SBA, its agent or 
Trustee;
    (3) To require all your commitments from investors to be funded at

    (a) Applicability of this section. This section applies to Leverage 
issued on or after April 25, 1994. For Leverage

[[Page 91]]

issued before April 25, 1994, you must comply with paragraphs (e) and 
(f) of this section and the Capital Impairment regulations in this part 
in effect when you issued your Leverage. For all Leverage issued, you 
must also comply with any contractual provisions to which you have 
agreed.
    (b) Significance of Capital Impairment condition. If you have a 
condition of Capital Impairment, you are not in compliance with the 
terms of your Leverage. As a result, SBA has the right to impose the 
applicable remedies for noncompliance in Secs. 107.1810(g) and 
107.1820(f).
    (c) Definition of Capital Impairment condition. You have a condition 
of Capital Impairment if your Capital Impairment Percentage, as computed 
in Sec. 107.1840, exceeds:
    (1) For Section 301(d) Licensees, 75 percent.
    (2) For Section 301(c) Licensees, the appropriate percentage from 
the following table:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (d) Phase-in of maximum permitted Capital Impairment Percentages for 
Section 301(c) Licensees. If you are a Section 301(c) Licensee, 
regardless of your maximum permitted Capital Impairment Percentage under 
paragraph (c) of this section, you will not have a condition of Capital 
Impairment if:
    (1) Your Capital Impairment Percentage does not exceed 50 percent; 
and
    (2) You have not reached your first fiscal year end occurring after 
April 25, 1995.
    (e) Quarterly computation requirement and procedure. You must 
determine whether you have a condition of Capital Impairment as of the 
end of each fiscal quarter. You must notify SBA promptly if you are 
capitally impaired.
    (f) SBA's right to determine Licensee's Capital Impairment 
condition. SBA may make its own determination of your Capital Impairment 
condition at any time.

[61 FR 3189, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 63 FR 5873, Feb. 5, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 107.1840  Computation of Licensee's Capital Impairment Percentage.

    (a) General. This section contains the procedures you must use to 
determine your Capital Impairment Percentage if you have outstanding 
Leverage issued after April 25, 1994. You must compare your Capital 
Impairment Percentage to the maximum permitted under Sec. 107.1830(c) to 
determine whether you have a condition of Capital Impairment.
    (b) Preliminary impairment test. If you satisfy the preliminary 
impairment test, your Capital Impairment Percentage is zero and you do 
not have to perform any more procedures in this Sec. 107.1840. 
Otherwise, you must continue with paragraph (c) of this section. You 
satisfy the test if the following amounts are both zero or greater:
    (1) The sum of Undistributed Net Realized Earnings, as reported on 
SBA Form 468, and Includible Non-Cash Gains.
    (2) Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Securities Held.

[[Page 92]]

    (c) How to compute your Capital Impairment Percentage. (1) If you 
have an Unrealized Gain on Securities Held, compute your Adjusted 
Unrealized Gain using paragraph (d) of this section. If you have an 
Unrealized Loss on Securities Held, continue with paragraph (c)(2) of 
this Section.
    (2) Add together your Undistributed Net Realized Earnings, your 
Includible Non-cash Gains, and either your Unrealized Loss on Securities 
Held or your Adjusted Unrealized Gain.
    (3) If the sum in paragraph (c)(2) of this section is zero or 
greater, your Capital Impairment Percentage is zero.
    (4) If the sum in paragraph (c)(2) of this section is less than 
zero, drop the negative sign, divide by your Regulatory Capital 
(excluding Treasury Stock), and multiply by 100. The result is your 
Capital Impairment Percentage.
    (d) How to compute your Adjusted Unrealized Gain. (1) Subtract 
Unrealized Depreciation from Unrealized Appreciation. This is your ``Net 
Appreciation''.
    (2) Determine your Unrealized Appreciation on Publicly Traded and 
Marketable securities. This is your ``Class 1 Appreciation''.
    (3) Determine your Unrealized Appreciation on securities that are 
not Publicly Traded and Marketable and meet the following criteria, 
which must be substantiated to the satisfaction of SBA (this is your 
``Class 2 Appreciation''):
    (i) The Small Business that issued the security received a 
significant subsequent equity financing by an investor whose objectives 
were not primarily strategic and at a price that conclusively supports 
the Unrealized Appreciation;
    (ii) Such financing represents a substantial investment in the form 
of an arm's length transaction by a sophisticated new investor in the 
issuer's securities; and
    (iii) Such financing occurred within 24 months of the date of the 
Capital Impairment computation, or the Small Business' pre-tax cash flow 
from operations for its most recent fiscal year was at least 10 percent 
of the Small Business' average contributed capital for such fiscal year.
    (4) Perform the appropriate computation from the following table:

          Adjusted Unrealized Gain Before Estimated Tax Effects
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                       Then adjusted
              If:                      And:           unrealized gain
                                                      before taxes is:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Class 1 Appreciation <ls-thn-   Class 1            (80%  x  Class 1
 eq> Net Appreciation.           Appreciation +     Appreciation) + (50%
                                 Class 2             x  Class 2
                                 Appreciation <ls-  Appreciation).
                                 thn-eq> Net
                                 Appreciation.
Class 1 Appreciation <ls-thn-   Class 1            (80%  x  Class 1
 eq> Net Appreciation.           Appreciation +     Appreciation) +
                                 Class 2            [(50%  x  (Net
                                 Appreciation >     Appreciation - Class
                                 Net Appreciation.  1 Appreciation)].
Class 1 Appreciation > Net      .................  80%  x  Net
 Appreciation.                                      Appreciation.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (5) Reduce the gain computed in paragraph (d)(4) of this section by 
your estimate of related future income tax expense. Subject to any 
adjustment required by paragraph (d)(6) of this section, the result is 
your Adjusted Unrealized Gain for use in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section.
    (6) If any securities that are the source of either Class 1 or Class 
2 Appreciation are pledged or encumbered in any way, you must reduce the 
Adjusted Unrealized Gain computed in paragraph (d)(5) of this section by 
the amount of the related borrowing or other obligation, up to the 
amount of the Unrealized Appreciation on the securities.


<R05>
Sec. 107.1850  Exceptions to Capital Impairment provisions for Licensees with outstanding Participating Securities.

    The provisions in this Sec. 107.1850 apply only if at least two-
thirds of your outstanding Leverage consists of Participating 
Securities, and at least two-thirds of your Loans and Investments (at 
cost) consist of Equity Capital Investments.
    (a) Forbearance period for Participating Securities issuers. During 
the first forty-

[[Page 93]]

eight (48) months following your first issuance of Participating 
Securities, you will not have a condition of Capital Impairment if your 
Capital Impairment Percentage is below 85 percent.
    (b) Extended forbearance period for early stage investors. If at 
least two-thirds of your Loans and Investments (at cost) are in Start-Up 
Financings, the forbearance period in paragraph (a) of this section is 
extended to 60 months.
    (c) Forbearance based on actions by Licensee. The provisions of this 
paragraph (c) apply only during the fifth and sixth years following your 
first issuance of Participating Securities. If your Capital Impairment 
Percentage, as determined either by you or by SBA, exceeds the maximum 
permitted under Sec. 107.1830(c) but is below 85 percent, you will not 
have a condition of Capital Impairment if you do either of the following 
within thirty (30) days of such determination:
    (1) Increase your Regulatory Capital by a cash contribution placed 
in an escrow account or other account satisfactory to SBA, for its 
benefit. The contribution must equal, during the fifth year, 15 percent 
of your outstanding Leverage or, during the sixth year, 30 percent.
    (2) Provide a guarantee, satisfactory to SBA and for its benefit, 
for the amount of the cash contribution required in paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section. SBA will credit any escrowed funds or guarantee received 
in the fifth year toward the requirements for the sixth year.
    (d) Conditions for forbearance under paragraph (c) of this section. 
(1) You cannot count any funds placed in an escrow or other account 
under paragraph (c) of this section as Leverageable Capital.
    (2) Any fee and/or any claim to repayment by the party making the 
capital contribution or by the guarantor must be deferred and 
subordinate to all outstanding Leverage plus any unpaid Earned 
Prioritized Payments and earned Adjustments.
    (3) If there is an acceleration or mandatory redemption under 
Sec. 107.1810 or Sec. 107.1820, any funds in the escrow account and/or 
any guarantee received under paragraph (c) of this section will be 
applied toward repaying any amounts due SBA.
    (4) If you reduce your Capital Impairment Percentage to zero, SBA 
will release and return any escrowed funds and/or any guarantee received 
under paragraph (c) of this section.

               Subpart K--Ending Operations as a Licensee


<R05>
Sec. 107.1900  Surrender of license.

    You may not surrender your license without SBA's prior written 
approval. Your request for approval must be accompanied by an offer of 
immediate repayment of all of your outstanding Leverage (including any 
prepayment penalties thereon), or by a plan satisfactory to SBA for the 
orderly liquidation of the Licensee.

                        Subpart L--Miscellaneous


<R05>
Sec. 107.1910  Non-waiver of SBA's rights or terms of Leverage security.

    SBA's failure to exercise or delay in exercising any right or remedy 
under the Act or the regulations in this part does not constitute a 
waiver of such right or remedy. SBA's failure to require you to perform 
any term or provision of your Leverage does not affect SBA's right to 
enforce such term or provision. Similarly, SBA's waiver of, or failure 
to enforce, any term or provision of your Leverage or of any event or 
condition set forth in Sec. 107.1810 or Sec. 107.1820 does not 
constitute a waiver of any succeeding breach of such term or provision 
or condition.


<R05>
Sec. 107.1920  Licensee's application for exemption from a regulation in this part 107.

    You may file an application in writing with SBA to have a proposed 
action exempted from any procedural or substantive requirement, 
restriction, or prohibition to which it is subject under this part, 
unless the provision is mandated by the Act. SBA may grant an exemption 
for such applicant, conditionally or unconditionally, provided the 
exemption would not be contrary to the purposes of the Act. Your 
application must be accompanied by supporting evidence which 
demonstrates to SBA's satisfaction that:

[[Page 94]]

    (a) The proposed action is fair and equitable; and
    (b) The exemption requested is reasonably calculated to advance the 
best interests of the SBIC program in a manner consonant with the policy 
objectives of the Act and the regulations in this part.


<R05>
Sec. 107.1930  Effect of changes in this part 107 on transactions previously consummated.

    The legality of a transaction covered by the regulations in this 
part is governed by the regulations in this part in effect at the time 
the transaction was consummated, regardless of later changes. Nothing in 
this part bars SBA enforcement action with respect to any transaction 
consummated in violation of provisions applicable at the time, but no 
longer in effect.

Sec. 112.3  Discrimination prohibited.

    (a) General. To the extent that this part applies, no person in the 
United States shall, on the ground of race, color or national origin be 
excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be 
otherwise subjected to discrimination by any business or other activity.
    (b) Specific discriminatory actions prohibited. (1) To the extent 
that this part applies, a business or other activity

[[Page 95]]

may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, on 
ground of race, color or national origin:
    (i) Deny an individual any services, financial aid or other benefit 
provided by the business or other activity;
    (ii) Provide any service, financial aid or other benefit to an 
individual which is different or is provided in a different manner, from 
that provided to others by the business or other activity;
    (iii) Subject an individual to segregation or separate treatment in 
any manner related to his receipt of any service, financial aid or other 
benefit from the business or other activity;
    (iv) Restrict an individual in any way in the enjoyment of any 
advantage or privilege enjoyed by others receiving any service, 
financial aid or other benefit from the business or other activity;
    (v) Treat an individual differently from others in determining 
whether he satisfies any admission, enrollment, quota, eligibility, 
membership or other requirement or condition which individuals must meet 
in order to be provided any service, financial aid or other benefit 
provided by the business or other activity.
    (2) The enumeration of specific forms of prohibited discrimination 
in this paragraph does not limit the generality of the prohibition in 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (3) This regulation does not prohibit the consideration of race, 
color, or national origin if the purpose and effect are to remove or 
overcome the consequences of practices or impediments which have 
restricted the availability of, or participation in, the program or 
activity receiving Federal financial assistance, on the grounds of race, 
color, or national origin. Where previous discriminatory practice or 
usage tends, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, to 
exclude individuals from participation in, to deny them the benefits of, 
or to subject them to discrimination under any program or activity to 
which this regulation applies, the applicant or recipient has an 
obligation to take reasonable action to remove or overcome the 
consequences of the prior discriminatory practice or usage, and to 
accomplish the purposes of the Act.

Sec. 112.4  Discrimination in employment.

    Small business concerns and development companies which apply for or 
receive any financial assistance of the kind described in Sec. 112.2(a) 
(1) and (2), including concerns which are identifiable beneficiaries of 
loans made under Sec. 112.2(a)(2), may not discriminate on the grounds 
of race, color, or national origin in their employment practices. Such 
assistance is deemed to have as a primary objective the providing of 
employment. Where a primary objective of the Federal financial 
assistance is not to provide employment, but discrimination on the 
grounds of race, color, or national origin in the employment practices 
of the recipient or other persons subject to the regulation tends, on 
the grounds of race, color, or national origin, to exclude individuals 
from participation in, to deny them the benefits of, or to subject them 
to discrimination under any program to which this regulation applies, 
the provisions of Sec. 112.7(a) shall apply to the employment practices 
of the recipient or other persons subject to the regulation, to the 
extent necessary to assure equality of opportunity and nondiscriminatory 
treatment.

[38 FR 17934, July 5, 1973]


<R05>
Sec. 112.5  Discrimination in providing financial assistance.

    Development companies and small business investment companies which 
apply for or receive any of the financial assistance described in 
Sec. 112.2(a) may not discriminate, on the ground of race, color or 
national origin, in providing financial assistance to small business 
concerns.


<R05>
Sec. 112.6  Discrimination in accommodations or services.

    Small business concerns which apply for or receive any financial 
assistance of the kind described in Sec. 112.2(a)(1), concerns which are 
identifiable beneficiaries of loans made under Sec. 112.2(a)(2), and 
physicians, hospitals, schools, libraries, and other individuals

[[Page 96]]

or organizations which apply for or receive financial assistance of the 
kind described in Sec. 112.2(a)(5), may not discriminate in the 
treatment accommodations or services they provide to their patients, 
students, visitors, guests, members, passengers, or patrons in the 
conduct of such businesses or other enterprises, whether or not operated 
for profit.

[31 FR 2374, Feb. 4, 1966]


<R05>
Sec. 112.7  Illustrative applications.

    (a) Employment. The discrimination prohibited by Sec. 112.4 includes 
but is not limited to any action (taken directly or through contractual 
or other arrangements) which subjects an individual to discrimination on 
the ground of race, color or national origin in any employment practice, 
including recruitment or recruitment advertising, employment, layoff or 
termination, upgrading, demotion, or transfer, rates of pay or other 
forms of compensation, and use of facilities.
    (b) Financial assistance. The discrimination prohibited by 
Sec. 112.5 includes but is not limited to the failure or refusal, 
because of the race, color, or national origin of a person, to extend a 
loan or equity financing to him or to any business concern of which he 
is an owner or employee; or, in the case of financing which has actually 
been extended, the failure or refusal, because of the race, color, or 
national origin of the borrower or of an owner or employee of the 
borrower, to accord the borrower fair treatment and the customary 
courtesies regarding such matters as default, grace periods and the 
like.
    (c) Accommodations or services. The discrimination prohibited by 
Sec. 112.6 includes but is not limited to the failure or refusal, 
because of the race, color, or national origin of a person, to accept 
him on a nonsegregated basis as a patient, student, visitor, guest, 
member, customer, passenger or patron.
    (d) Affirmative action. (1) In some situations even though past 
discriminatory practices have been abandoned, the consequences of such 
practices continue to impede the full availability of equal opportunity. 
If the efforts required of the applicant or recipient under 
Sec. 112.3(b)(3) to provide information as to the availability of equal 
opportunity, and the rights of individuals under this regulation, have 
failed to overcome these consequences, it will become necessary for such 
applicant or recipient to take additional steps to make equal 
opportunity fully available to racial and nationality groups previously 
subjected to discrimination.
    (2) Even though an applicant or recipient has never used 
discriminatory policies, the opportunities in the business it operates 
may not in fact be equally available to some racial or nationality 
groups. In such circumstances a recipient may properly give special 
consideration to race, color, or national origin to make opportunity 
more widely available to such groups.

[30 FR 298, Jan. 9, 1965, as amended at 38 FR 17934, July 5, 1973]


<R05>
Sec. 112.8  Assurances required.

    An application for any of the financial assistance described in 
Sec. 112.2(a) shall, as a condition to its approval and the extension of 
such assistance, contain or be accompanied by an assurance that the 
recipient will comply with this part. Such an assurance shall contain 
provisions authorizing the acceleration of the maturity of the 
recipient's financial obligation to the SBA in the event of a failure to 
comply, and provisions which give the United States a right to seek 
judicial enforcement of the terms of the assurance. SBA shall specify 
the form of the foregoing assurance for each program, and the extent to 
which like assurances will be required of contractors and 
subcontractors, transferees, successors in interest, and other 
participants in the program.


<R05>
Sec. 112.9  Compliance information.

    (a) Cooperation and assistance. SBA shall to the fullest extent 
practicable seek the cooperation of applicants and recipients in 
obtaining compliance with this part and shall provide assistance and 
guidance to applicants and recipients to help them comply voluntarily 
with this part.
    (b) Compliance reports. Each applicant or recipient shall keep such 
records and submit to SBA timely, complete and accurate compliance 
reports at

[[Page 97]]

such times, and in such form and containing such information, as SBA may 
determine to be necessary to enable SBA to ascertain whether the 
applicant or recipient has complied or is complying with this part. In 
the case of a small business concern which receives financial assistance 
from a development company or from a small business investment company, 
such concern shall submit to the company such information as may be 
necessary to enable the company to meet its reporting requirements under 
this part.
    (c) Access to sources of information. Each applicant or recipient 
shall permit access by SBA during normal business hours to such of its 
books, records, accounts, and other sources of information, and its 
facilities as may be pertinent to ascertain compliance with this part. 
Where any information required of an applicant or recipient is in the 
exclusive possession of any other agency, institution or person and this 
agency, institution or person shall fail or refuse to furnish this 
information, the applicant or recipient shall so certify in its report 
and shall set forth what efforts it has made to obtain this information.
    (d) Information to the public. Each recipient shall make available 
to persons entitled under the Act and under this part to protection 
against discrimination by the recipient such information as SBA may find 
necessary to apprise them of their rights to such protection.

<R05>
Sec. 112.10  Conduct of investigations.

    (a) Periodic compliance reviews. SBA shall from time to time review 
the practices of recipients to determine whether they are complying with 
this part.
    (b) Complaints. Any person who believes himself or any specific 
class of individuals to be subjected to discrimination prohibited by 
this part may, by himself or by a representative, file with SBA a 
written complaint. A complaint must be filed not later than 180 days 
from the date of the alleged discrimination, unless the time for filing 
is extended by SBA.
    (c) Investigations. SBA will make a prompt investigation whenever a 
compliance review, report, complaint, or any other information indicates 
a possible failure to comply with this part. The investigation should 
include, where appropriate, a review of the pertinent practices and 
policies of the applicant or recipient, the circumstances under which 
the possible noncompliance with this part occurred, and other factors 
relevant to a determination as to whether the applicant or recipient has 
failed to comply with this part.
    (d) Resolution of matters. (1) If an investigation pursuant to 
paragraph (c) of this section indicates a failure to comply with this 
part, SBA will so inform the applicant or recipient and the matter will 
be resolved by informal means whenever possible. If it has been 
determined that the matter cannot be resolved by informal means, action 
will be taken as provided for in Sec. 112.11.
    (2) If an investigation does not warrant action pursuant to 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section, SBA will so inform the applicant or 
recipient and the complainant, if any, in writing.
    (e) Intimidatory or retaliatory acts prohibited. No applicant or 
recipient or other person shall intimidate, threaten, coerce, or 
discriminate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with 
any right or privilege secured by section 601 of the Act or by this part 
or because he has made a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated 
in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this 
part. The identity of complainants shall be kept confidential except to 
the extent necessary to carry out the purposes of this part, including 
the conduct of any investigation, hearing, or judicial proceeding 
arising thereunder.

<R05>
Sec. 112.11  Procedure for effecting compliance.

    (a) General. (1) If there appears to be a failure or threatened 
failure to comply with this part and if the noncompliance or threatened 
noncompliance cannot be corrected by informal means, compliance with 
this part may be effected by suspending, terminating, or refusing any 
financial assistance approved but not yet disbursed to an applicant or, 
in the case of a loan which

[[Page 98]]

has been partially disbursed, by refusing to make further disbursements. 
In addition, compliance may be effected by any other means authorized by 
law.
    (2) Such other means may include but are not limited to (i) legal 
action by SBA to enforce its right, embodied in the assurances described 
in Sec. 112.8, to accelerate the maturity of the recipient's obligation; 
(ii) a reference to the Department of Justice with a recommendation that 
appropriate proceedings be brought to enforce any rights of the United 
States under any law of the United States, including other titles of the 
Act; and (iii) any applicable proceedings under State or local law.
    (b) Noncompliance with Sec. 112.8. If an applicant fails or refuses 
to furnish an assurance required under Sec. 112.8 or otherwise fails or 
refuses to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to that 
section Federal financial assistance may be refused in accordance with 
the procedures of paragraph (c) of this section. SBA shall not be 
required to provide assistance in such a case during the pendency of the 
administrative proceedings under such paragraph except that SBA shall 
continue assistance during the pendency of such proceedings where such 
assistance is due and payable pursuant to an application therefor 
approved prior to the effective date of this part. Such proceedings 
shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of part 134 of this 
chapter by an Administrative Law Judge of the Office of Hearings and 
Appeals, who shall issue an initial decision in the case. The 
Administrator shall be the reviewing official for purposes of 
Sec. 134.228. The applicant's failure to file a timely motion in 
accordance with Secs. 134.222 and 134.211, requesting that the matter be 
scheduled for an oral hearing, shall constitute waiver of the right to 
an oral hearing but shall not prevent the submission of written 
information and argument for the record in accordance with the 
provisions of part 134.
    (c) Conditions precedent. No order suspending, terminating, or 
refusing financial assistance shall become effective until (1) SBA has 
advised the applicant or recipient of his failure to comply and has 
determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means; (2) 
there has been an express finding on the record after an opportunity for 
an oral hearing, of a failure by the applicant or recipient to comply 
with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to this part; (3) the initial 
decision has become final pursuant to Sec. 134.227(b); and (4) the 
expiration of 30 days after SBA has filed with the committee of the 
House and the committee of the Senate having legislative jurisdiction of 
the form of financial assistance involved, a full written report of the 
circumstances and the grounds for such action.
    (d) Other means authorized by law. No action to effect compliance by 
any other means authorized by law shall be taken until (1) SBA has 
determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means; (2) the 
action has been approved by the Administrator or his designee; (3) the 
applicant or recipient or other person has been notified of its failure 
to comply and of the action to be taken to effect compliance; and (4) 
the expiration of at least 10 days from the mailing of such notice to 
the applicant or recipient or other person. During this period of at 
least 10 days from the mailing of such notice to the applicant or 
recipient or other person. During this period of at least 10 days 
additional efforts shall be made to persuade the applicant or recipient 
or other person to comply with this part and to take such corrective 
action as may be appropriate.

<R05>
Sec. 112.12  Effect on other regulations; forms and instructions.

    (a) Effect on other regulations. All regulations, orders or like 
directions heretofore issued by SBA which impose requirements designed 
to prohibit any discrimination against individuals on the grounds of 
race, color, or national origin and which authorize the suspension or 
termination of or refusal to grant to or to continue financial 
assistance to any applicant for or recipient of such assistance for 
failure to comply with such requirements, are hereby superseded to the 
extent that such discrimination is prohibited by this part,

[[Page 99]]

except that nothing in this part shall be deemed to relieve any person 
of any obligation assumed or imposed under any such superseded 
regulation, order, instruction, or like direction prior to the effective 
date of this part. Nothing in this part, however, shall be deemed to 
supersede any of the following (including future amendments thereof):
    (1) Executive Order 11246 and regulations issued thereunder, or (2) 
any other orders, regulations or instructions, insofar as such order, 
regulations, or instructions prohibit discrimination on the grounds of 
race, color, or national origin in any program or situation to which 
this part is inapplicable or prohibit discrimination on any other 
ground.
    (b) Forms and instructions. SBA shall issue and promptly make 
available to interested persons forms and detailed instructions and 
procedures for effectuating this part.
    (c) Supervision and coordination. The Administrator may from time to 
time assign to officials of SBA or to officials of other agencies of the 
Government with the consent of such agencies, responsibilities in 
connection with the effectuation of the purpose of Title VI of the Act 
and this part (other than responsibility for final decision as provided 
in Sec. 112.13), including the achievement of effective coordination and 
maximum uniformity within SBA and within the Executive Branch of the 
Government in the application of Title VI and this part to similar 
programs and in similar situations. Any action taken, determination 
made, or requirement imposed by an official of another Department or 
agency acting pursuant to an assignment of responsibility under this 
subsection shall have the same effect as though such action had been 
taken by the Administrator of SBA.

<R05>
Sec. 113.1  Purpose.

    (a) Part 112 of this chapter, issued pursuant to Title VI of the 
Civil Rights Act of 1964, prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, 
color, or national origin by some recipients of financial assistance 
from SBA. The purpose of this part is to reflect to the fullest extent 
possible the nondiscrimination policies of the Federal Government as 
expressed in the several statutes, Executive Orders, and messages of the 
President dealing with civil rights and equality of opportunity, and in 
the previous determination of the Administrator of the Small Business 
Administration that discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, 
marital status, handicap or national origin shall be prohibited, to the 
extent that it is not prohibited by part 112 of this chapter, to all 
recipients of financial assistance from SBA.
    (b) In accordance with Pub. L. 94-239, 15 U.S.C. 1691, cited as the 
Equal Credit Act Amendments of 1976, it is unlawful for any recipient 
creditor to discriminate against any applicant, with respect to any 
aspect of a credit transaction because of race, color, religion, 
national origin, sex, marital status, age: (Provided, the applicant has 
the capacity to contract), because all or part of the applicant's income 
derives from any public assistance program, or because the applicant has 
in good faith exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection 
Act.
    (c) It is the intention of the Administrator that the prohibitions 
in this part supplement those in part 112 of this chapter, that the two 
parts be read in pari materia, and that the procedures established 
herein be harmonized to the maximum extent feasible with those 
established in part 112 of this chapter.

Sec. 113.3  Discrimination prohibited.

    To the extent not covered or prohibited by part 112 of this chapter, 
recipients of financial assistance may not:
    (a) Discriminate with regard to goods, services, or accommodations 
offered or provided by the aided business or other enterprise, whether 
or not operated for profit, because of race, color, religion, sex, 
handicap, or national origin of a person, or fail or refuse to accept a 
person on a nonsegregated basis as a patient, student, visitor, guest, 
customer, passenger, or patron.
    (b) With regard to employment practices within the aided business or 
other enterprise, whether or not operated for profit; fail or refuse, 
because of race, color, religion, sex or national origin of a person, to 
seek or retain the person's services, or to provide the person with 
opportunities for advancement or promotion, or accord an employee the

[[Page 102]]

rank and rate of compensation, including fringe benefits, merited by the 
employee's services and abilities.
    (c) With regard to employment practices within the aided business or 
other enterprise, whether or not operated for profit; discriminate 
against a qualified handicapped person; or because of handicap, fail or 
refuse to seek or retain the person's services or to provide the person 
with opportunities for advancement or promotion, or accord an employee 
the rank and rate of compensation, including fringe benefits, merited by 
the employee's services and abilities. All employment decisions shall be 
made in a manner which ensures that discrimination on the basis of 
handicap does not occur. Such decisions may not limit, segregate, or 
classify job applicants or employees in any way that adversely affects 
the opportunities or status of qualified handicapped individuals.
    (d) Participate in a contractual or other relationship that has the 
effect of subjecting job applicants or employees to discrimination 
prohibited by this part. The relationships referred to in this paragraph 
include those with employment and referral agencies, labor unions, 
organizations providing or administering fringe benefits to employees of 
the recipient, and organizations providing training and apprenticeship 
programs. Activities covered by this part are as follows:
    (1) Recruitment, advertising, and the processing of applications for 
employment;
    (2) Hiring, upgrading, promotion, award of tenure, demotion, 
transfer, layoff, termination, right of return from layoff, and 
rehiring;
    (3) Rates of pay or any other form of compensation and changes in 
compensation;
    (4) Job assignments, job classifications, organizational structures, 
position descriptions, lines of progression, and seniority lists;
    (5) Leaves of absence, sick leave, or any other leave;
    (6) Fringe benefits available by virtue of employment, whether or 
not administered by the recipient;
    (7) Selection and financial support for training, including 
apprenticeship, professional meetings, conferences, and other related 
activities, and selection for leaves of absence to pursue training;
    (8) Employer sponsored activities, including social or recreational 
programs; and
    (9) Any other term, condition, or privilege of employment.
    (e) Use employment tests or criteria that discriminate on the basis 
of race, color, religion, sex, marital status, handicap, or national 
origin. Employment tests which are used for all other job applicants 
shall be adapted in an appropriate mode for use by persons who have 
handicaps that impair sensory, manual, or speaking skills.
    (f) Conduct a preemployment medical examination, unless required of 
all job applicants, and subsequent to a conditional offer of employment. 
The results of all such medical examinations shall be kept confidential.
    (g) Make a preemployment inquiry as to whether a job applicant is a 
handicapped person or as to the nature or severity of a handicap: EXCEPT 
when a recipient is taking remedial action to overcome the effects of 
conditions which resulted in past discrimination, or when a recipient is 
taking affirmative action pursuant to section 503 of the Rehabilitation 
Act of 1973, as amended.
    (1) Such preemployment inquiry may only be made after the job 
applicant has been informed that such disclosure is for the purposes set 
forth in paragraph (g) of this section; that the disclosure is voluntary 
and will be kept confidential; and that refusal of the job applicant to 
provide such information will not subject the applicant to any adverse 
action.
    (2) Information elicited from qualified handicapped job applicants 
concerning their medical history or condition shall be kept confidential 
EXCEPT that:
    (i) Supervisors and managers may be informed about restrictions on 
or accommodations to be made for the qualified handicapped individual;
    (ii) First aid and safety personnel may be informed, where 
appropriate, of the need for possible emergency treatment; and

[[Page 103]]

    (iii) Compliance officials shall be given relevant information, if 
requested.
    (h) Discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, handicap or 
national origin in the use of toilets or any facilities for rest or 
comfort. Discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, 
handicap or national origin in the use of cafeterias, recreational 
programs or other programs sponsored by the applicant or recipient.
    (i) With regard to all recipients offering credit, such as Small 
Business Investment Companies and Community Development Companies, 
discriminate against debtors on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, 
marital status, handicap, or national origin.
    (j) With regard to the granting of credit by all recipient 
creditors, discriminate against any credit applicant, with respect to 
any aspect of a credit transaction because of race, color, religion, 
national origin, sex, marital status, handicap, age (provided the 
applicant has the capacity to contract), because all or part of the 
applicant's income derives from any public assistance program, or 
because the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the 
Consumer Credit Protection Act.


<R05>
Sec. 113.3-1  Consideration of race, color, religion, sex, marital status, handicap, or national origin.

    (a) This regulation does not prohibit the consideration of race, 
color, religion, sex, marital status, handicap, or national origin if 
the purpose and effect are to remove or overcome the consequences of 
practices or impediments which have restricted the availability of, or 
participation in, the program or activity receiving Federal financial 
assistance, on the grounds of race, color, religion, sex, marital 
status, handicap, or national origin. Where previous discriminatory 
practices or usage tends, on the grounds of race, color, religion, sex, 
marital status, handicap, or national origin, to exclude individuals 
from participation in, to deny them the benefits of, or to subject them 
to discrimination under any program or activity to which this regulation 
applies, the applicant or recipient has an obligation to take reasonable 
action to remove or overcome the consequences of the prior 
discriminatory practice or usage, and to accomplish the purposes of this 
regulation. All programs and activities shall be administered in the 
most integrated setting possible.
    (b) Nothing in this part shall prohibit the restriction of certain 
jobs to members of one sex if a bona fide occupational qualification can 
be demonstrated by the applicant or recipient. Custom or tradition is 
not a bona fide occupational qualification.
    (c) Recipients shall take steps to ensure that communications with 
job applicants and employees who have vision and/or hearing disabilities 
are available in appropriate modes.
    (d) Recipients shall make reasonable accommodation to the known 
physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified handicapped job 
applicant or employee UNLESS the recipient can demonstrate that the 
accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the 
business. Factors to be considered in determining whether an 
accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of a 
recipient's business include:
    (1) The overall size of the recipient's business with respect to 
number of employees, number and type of facilities, size of budget, and 
the financial condition of the business;
    (2) The type of the recipient's operation, including the composition 
and structure of the recipient's workforce; and
    (3) The nature and cost of the accommodation needed.
    (e) Such accommodation may include making facilities used by 
employees readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons, job 
restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, acquisition or 
modification of equipment or devices, the provision of readers or 
interpreters, and other similar actions.
    (f) The final decision, when making a review or investigation of a 
complaint, as to whether an accommodation would impose an undue hardship 
on the operation of a recipient business will be made by the compliance 
officials of the Small Business Administration.

[[Page 104]]

    (g) Recipients shall administer programs and activities in the most 
integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified handicapped 
persons, and shall not participate in a contractual relationship that 
has the effect of subjecting qualified handicapped job applicants or 
employees to discrimination prohibited by this part. The relationships 
referred to in this paragraph include those with referral agencies, 
labor unions, organizations providing or administering fringe benefits 
to employees of the recipient, and organizations providing training and 
apprenticeship programs.
    (h) Nothing in this part shall apply to a religious corporation, 
association, educational institution or society with respect to the 
membership or the employment of individuals of a particular religion to 
perform work connected with the carrying on by such corporation, 
association, educational institution or society of its religious 
activities.


<R05>
Sec. 113.3-2  Accommodations to religious observance and practice.

    A recipient of financial assistance must accommodate to the 
religious observances and practices of an employee or prospective 
employee unless the recipient demonstrates that it is unable to 
reasonably accommodate to an employee's or prospective employee's 
religious observance or practice without undue hardship on the conduct 
of the employer's business. As part of this obligation, recipient must 
make reasonable accommodations to the religious observances and 
practices of an employee or prospective employee who regularly observes 
Friday evening and Saturday, or some other day of the week, as Sabbath 
and/or who observes certain religious holidays during the year and who 
is conscientiously opposed to performing work or engaging in similar 
activity on such days, when such accommodations can be made without 
undue hardship on the conduct of the employer's business. In determining 
the extent of a recipient's obligations under this section, at least the 
following factors should be considered: (a) Business necessity, (b) 
financial costs and expenses, and (c) resulting personnel problems.


<R05>
Sec. 113.3-3  Structural accommodations for handicapped clients.

    (a) Existing facilities. Recipients in preexisting structures shall 
make their goods or services accessible to and usable by handicapped 
clients. Where structural changes are necessary to make the recipient's 
goods or services accessible, such changes shall be made as soon as 
practicable, but in no event later than three years after the effective 
date of this Regulation. A plan setting forth the steps necessary to 
complete such structural changes shall be developed and submitted to 
SBA. If practical, interested persons, including handicapped persons or 
organizations representing handicapped persons, will be consulted.
    (b) Design, construction, and alteration. New facilities shall be 
designed and constructed to be readily accessible to and usable by 
persons with handicaps. Alterations to existing facilities that affect 
usability shall, to the maximum extent feasible, be designed and 
constructed to be readily accessible to and usable by handicapped 
persons.
    (c) Conformance with Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards. (1) 
Effective as of January 18, 1991, design, construction, or alteration of 
buildings in conformance with sections 3-8 of the Uniform Federal 
Accessibility Standards (UFAS) (appendix A to 41 CFR subpart 101-19.6) 
shall be deemed to comply with the requirements of this section with 
respect to those buildings. Departures from particular technical and 
scoping requirements of UFAS by the use of other methods are permitted 
where substantially equivalent or greater access to and usability of the 
building is provided.
    (2) For purposes of this section, section 4.1.6(1)(g) of UFAS shall 
be interpreted to exempt from the requirements of UFAS only mechanical 
rooms and other spaces that, because of their intended use, will not 
require accessibility to the public or beneficiaries or result in the 
employment or residence therein of persons with physical handicaps.
    (3) This section does not require recipients to make building 
alterations

[[Page 105]]

that have little likelihood of being accomplished without removing or 
altering a load-bearing structural member.

[44 FR 20068, Apr. 4, 1979, as amended at 45 FR 81734, Dec. 12, 1980; 55 
FR 52138, 52140, Dec. 19, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 113.4  Assurances required.

    An application for financial assistance shall, as a condition to its 
approval and the extension of such assistance, contain or be accompanied 
by an assurance that the recipient will comply with this part. Such an 
assurance shall contain provisions authorizing the acceleration of the 
maturity of the recipient's financial obligations to SBA in the event of 
a failure to comply, and provisions which give the United States a right 
to seek judicial enforcement of the terms of the assurance. SBA shall 
specify the form of the foregoing assurance for each program, and the 
extent to which like assurances will be required of contractors and 
subcontractors, transferees, successors in interest, and other 
participants in the program.


<R05>
Sec. 113.5  Compliance information.

    (a) Cooperation and assistance: SBA shall to the fullest extent 
practicable seek the cooperation of applicants and recipients in 
obtaining compliance with this part and shall provide assistance and 
guidance to applicants and recipients to help them comply voluntarily 
with this part. Recipients are expected to continually evaluate their 
compliance status, with the assistance of interested persons, including 
handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons.
    (b) Compliance reports: Each applicant or recipient shall keep such 
records and submit to SBA timely, complete and accurate compliance 
reports at such times, and in such form and containing such information, 
as SBA may determine to be necessary to enable SBA to ascertain whether 
the applicant or recipient has complied or is complying with this part. 
In the case of a small business concern which receives financial 
assistance from a development company or from a small business 
investment company, such concern shall submit to the company such 
information as may be necessary to enable the company to meet its 
reporting requirements under this part.
    (c) Access to sources of information: Each applicant or recipient 
shall permit access by SBA during normal business hours to such of its 
books, records, accounts and other sources of information, and its 
facilities as may be pertinent to ascertain compliance with this part. 
Where any information required of an applicant or recipient is in the 
exclusive possession of any other agency, institution or person; and 
such agency, institution or person shall fail or refuse to furnish this 
information, the applicant or recipient shall so certify in its report 
and shall set forth what efforts it has made to obtain this information.
    (d) Information to the Public. Each recipient shall make available 
to persons entitled under this part to protection against discrimination 
by the recipient such information as SBA may find necessary to apprise 
them of their rights to such protection.
    (1) In some situations even though past discriminatory practices 
have been abandoned, the consequences of such practices continue to 
impede the full availability of equal opportunity. If the efforts 
required of the applicant or recipient under Sec. 113.5(b) to provide 
information as to the availability of equal opportunity, and the rights 
of individuals under this regulation, have failed to overcome these 
consequences, it will become necessary for such applicant or recipient 
to take additional steps to make equal opportunity fully available to 
racial, qualified handicapped, nationality groups and persons who 
because of their sex were previously subjected to discrimination.
    (2) Even though an applicant or recipient has never used 
discriminatory policies, the opportunities in the business it operates 
may not in fact be equally available to some racial, qualified 
handicapped, or nationality groups. In such circumstances a recipient 
may properly give special consideration to race, color, religion, sex, 
marital status, qualified handicap or national origin to make the 
opportunities more widely available to such groups.

[[Page 106]]


<R05>
Sec. 113.6  Conduct of investigations.

    (a) Periodic compliance reviews. SBA shall from time to time review 
the practices of recipients to determine whether they are complying with 
this part.
    (b) Complaints. Any person who believes that he, she or any class of 
individuals has been subjected to discrimination prohibited by this part 
may, personally or through a representative, file with SBA a written 
complaint. A complaint must be filed not later than 180 days from the 
date of the alleged discrimination, unless the time for filing is 
extended by SBA.
    (c) Investigations. SBA will make a prompt investigation whenever a 
compliance review, report, complaint, or any other information indicates 
a possible failure to comply with this part. The investigation should 
include, where appropriate, a review of the pertinent practices and 
policies of the applicant or recipient, the circumstances under which 
the possible noncompliance with this part occurred, and other factors 
relevant to a determination as to whether the applicant or recipient has 
failed to comply with this part.
    (d) Resolution of matters. (1) If an investigation pursuant to 
paragraph (c) of this section indicates a failure to comply with this 
part, SBA will so inform the applicant or recipient and the matter will 
be resolved by informal means whenever possible. If it has been 
determined that the matter cannot be resolved by informal means, action 
will be taken as provided for in Sec. 113.7.
    (2) If an investigation does not warrant action pursuant to 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section, SBA will so inform the applicant or 
recipient and the complainant, if any, in writing.
    (e) Intimidatory or retaliatory acts prohibited. No applicant or 
recipient or other person shall intimidate, threaten, coerce, or 
discriminate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with 
any right or privilege secured by this part or because he has made a 
complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an 
investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this part. The identity of 
complainants shall be kept confidential except to the extent necessary 
to carry out the purposes of this part, including the conduct of any 
investigation, hearing, or judicial proceeding arising thereunder.


<R05>
Sec. 113.7  Procedure for effecting compliance.

    (a) General. (1) If there appears to be a failure or threatened 
failure to comply with this part and if the noncompliance or threatened 
noncompliance cannot be corrected by informal means, compliance with 
this part may be effected by suspending, terminating, or refusing any 
financial assistance approved but not yet disbursed to an applicant. In 
the case of loans partially or fully disbursed, compliance with this 
part may be effected by calling, canceling, terminating, accelerating 
repayment, or suspending in whole or in part the financial assistance 
provided. In addition compliance may be effected by any other means 
authorized by law.
    (2) Such other means may include but are not limited to (i) legal 
action by SBA to enforce its rights, embodied in the assurances 
described in Sec. 113.4; (ii) a reference to the Department of Justice 
with a recommendation that appropriate proceedings be brought to enforce 
any rights of the United States under any law of the United States; and 
(iii) any applicable proceedings under State or local law.
    (b) Noncompliance with Sec. 113.4. If an applicant fails or refuses 
to furnish an assurance required under Sec. 113.4 or otherwise fails or 
refuses to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to that 
section, Federal financial assistance may be refused in accordance with 
the procedures of paragraph (c) of this section. SBA shall not be 
required to provide assistance in such a case during the pendency of the 
administrative proceedings under such paragraph except that SBA shall 
continue assistance during the pendency of such proceedings where such 
assistance is due and payable pursuant to an application therefor 
approved prior to the effective date of this part. Such proceedings 
shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of part 134 of this 
chapter by an Administrative Law Judge of the Office of Hearings and 
Appeals, who shall issue an initial decision in the case. The 
Admininstrator shall be the reviewing official for purposes of

[[Page 107]]

Sec. 134.228. The applicant's failure to file a timely motion in 
accordance with Secs. 134.222 and 134.211, requesting that the matter be 
scheduled for an oral hearing, shall constitute waiver of the right to 
an oral hearing but shall not prevent the submission of written 
information and argument for the record in accordance with the 
provisions of part 134.
    (c) Condition precedent. Under this part 113, no order suspending, 
terminating, refusing, calling, canceling, or accelerating repayment of 
financial assistance in whole or in part shall become effective until 
(1) SBA has advised the applicant or recipient of his failure to comply 
and has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means; 
(2) there has been an express finding on the record after an opportunity 
for an oral hearing, of a failure by the applicant or recipient to 
comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to this part; and (3) 
the initial decision has become final pursuant to Sec. 134.227(b).
    (d) Other means authorized by law. No action to effect compliance by 
any other means authorized by law shall be taken until:
    (1) SBA has determined that compliance cannot be secured by 
voluntary means.
    (2) The action has been approved by the Administrator or the 
Administrator's designee.
    (3) The applicant or recipient or other person has been notified of 
its failure to comply and of the action to be taken to effect 
compliance.
    (4) The expiration of at least 10 days from the mailing of such 
notice to the applicant or recipient or other person. During this period 
of at least 10 days, additional efforts shall be made to persuade the 
applicant or recipient or other person to comply with this part and to 
take such corrective action as may be appropriate.

FR 2691, Jan. 29, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 113.8  Effect on other regulations, forms and instructions.

    (a) Effect on other regulations. All regulations, orders of like 
directions heretofore issued by SBA which impose requirements designed 
to prohibit any discrimination against individuals on the grounds of 
race, color, religion, sex, handicap, marital status, age, or national 
origin and which authorize the suspension or termination of a refusal to 
grant to or to continue financial assistance to any applicant for or 
recipient of such assistance for failure to comply with such 
requirements, are hereby superseded to the extent that such 
discrimination is prohibited by this part, except that nothing in this 
part shall be deemed to relieve any person of any obligation assumed or 
imposed under any such superseded regulation, order, instruction or like 
direction prior to the effective date of this part.
    (b) Forms and instructions. SBA shall issue and promptly make 
available to interested persons forms and detailed instructions and 
procedures for effectuating this part.
    (c) Supervision and coordination. The Administrator may from time-
to-time assign to officials of SBA or to officials of other agencies of 
the Government, with the consent of such agencies, responsibilities in 
connection with the effectuation of the purposes of this part (other 
than responsibility of first decisions as provided in Sec. 113.9) 
including the achievement of effective coordination and maximum 
uniformity within SBA and within the executive branch of the Government 
in the application of this part and of comparable regulations issued by 
other agencies of the Government to similar situations. Any action 
taken, determination made, or requirement imposed by an official of 
another department or agency acting pursuant to an assignment of 
responsibility under this subsection shall have the same effect as 
though such action had been taken by the Administrator of SBA.

<R05>
Sec. 114.105  Who investigates and considers my claim?

    (a) SBA may investigate, or ask another Federal agency to 
investigate, your claim. SBA also may request any Federal agency to 
conduct a physical examination of you and provide a report to SBA. SBA 
will reimburse the Federal agency for the costs of that examination when 
authorized or required by statute or regulation.
    (b) In those cases in which SBA investigates your claim, the SBA 
District Counsel with jurisdiction over the site will conduct an 
investigation and make recommendations or a determination with respect 
to your claim. The District Counsel may negotiate with you and is 
authorized to use alternative dispute resolution mechanisms (nonbinding 
on SBA) when they may promote the prompt, fair and efficient resolution 
of your claim.
    (c) If your claim is for $5,000 or less, the District Counsel may 
deny the claim, or may recommend approval, compromise, or settlement of 
the claim to the General Counsel or designee, who may take final action. 
The District Counsel first must refer the claim to SBA's General Counsel 
or designee for review if SBA should consult with the Department of 
Justice before approving the claim, as required under Sec. 114.107.


<R05>
Sec. 114.106  What if my claim exceeds $5,000?

    The District Counsel must review and investigate your claim and 
forward it with a report and recommendation to the General Counsel or 
designee, who may approve or deny an award, compromise, or settlement of 
claims in excess of $5,000, but not exceeding $25,000. The General 
Counsel or designee will handle claims in excess of $25,000 as required 
by Sec. 114.107.


<R05>
Sec. 114.107  What if my claim exceeds $25,000 or has other special features?

    (a) The U.S. Attorney General or designee must approve in writing 
any award, compromise, or settlement of a claim in excess of $25,000. 
For this purpose, a principal claim and any derivative or subrogated 
claim are considered a single claim.
    (b) SBA must consult with the Department of Justice before 
adjusting, determining, compromising, or settling a claim whenever the 
General Counsel or designee determines:
    (1) The claim involves a new precedent or a new point of law; or
    (2) The claim involves or may involve a question of policy; or
    (3) The United States is or may be entitled to indemnity or 
contribution from a third party and SBA is unable to adjust the third 
party claim; or
    (4) Approval of a claim, as a practical matter, will or may control 
the disposition of a related claim in which the amount to be paid may 
exceed $25,000.
    (c) SBA must consult with the Department of Justice before 
adjusting, determining, compromising, or settling a claim whenever SBA 
learns that the United States, or any of its employees, agents, or cost-
plus contractors, is involved in litigation based on a claim arising out 
of the same incident or transaction.
    (d) SBA, acting through its General Counsel or designee, must make 
any referrals to the Department of Justice

[[Page 111]]

for approval or consultation by transmitting them in writing to the 
Assistant Attorney General, Civil Division.
    (1) The referral must contain a short and concise statement of the 
facts and the reason for the request or referral, copies of the relevant 
portions of the claim file, and SBA's views and recommendations.
    (2) SBA may make this referral at any time after a claim is 
presented.


<R05>
Sec. 114.108  What if my claim is approved?

    SBA will notify you in writing if it approves your claim. The 
District Counsel will forward to you or your agent or legal 
representative the forms necessary to indicate satisfaction of your 
claim and your acceptance of the payment. Acceptance by you, your agent 
or your legal representative, of any award, compromise or settlement of 
your claim is final and conclusive under the Federal Tort Claims Act. It 
binds you, your agent or your legal representative, and any other person 
on whose behalf or for whose benefit the claim was presented. It also 
constitutes a complete release of your claim against the United States 
and its employees. If you are represented by counsel, SBA will designate 
you and your counsel as joint payees and will deliver the check to your 
counsel. Payment is contingent upon the waiver of your claim and is 
subject to the availability of appropriated funds.


<R05>
Sec. 114.109  What if my claim is denied?

    SBA will notify you or your agent or legal representative in writing 
by certified or registered mail if it denies your claim. You have a 
right to file suit in an appropriate U.S. District Court not later than 
six months after the date the notification was mailed.


<R04>
     Subpart B--Representation and Indemnification of SBA Employees


<R05>
Sec. 114.110  What is SBA's policy with respect to indemnifying and providing legal representation to SBA employees?

    (a) If an SBA employee engages in conduct, within the scope of his 
or her employment, which gives rise to a claim, and the SBA 
Administrator or designee determines that any of the following actions 
relating to the claim are in SBA's interest, SBA may:
    (1) Indemnify the employee after a verdict, judgment, or other 
monetary award is rendered personally against the employee in any civil 
suit in state or federal court or any arbitration proceeding;
    (2) Settle or compromise the claim; and/or
    (3) Pay for, or request that the Department of Justice provide, 
legal representation to the employee once personally named in such a 
suit.
    (b) If you are an SBA employee, you may ask SBA to settle or 
compromise your claim, provide you with legal representation, or provide 
you with indemnification for a verdict, judgment or award entered 
against you in a suit. To do so, you must submit a timely, written 
request to the General Counsel, with appropriate documentation, 
including copies of any pleadings, verdict, judgment, award, or 
settlement proposal. The General Counsel will decide all requests for 
representation or settlement, and will forward to the Administrator, 
with the accompanying documentation and a recommendation, any requests 
for indemnification.
    (c) Any payments by SBA under this section will be contingent upon 
the availability of appropriated funds.


<R05>
Sec. 114.111  Does the attorney-client privilege apply when SBA employees are represented by the Government?

    When attorneys employed by SBA participate in any process in which 
SBA seeks to determine whether SBA should request the Department of 
Justice to provide representation to an SBA employee sued, subpoenaed, 
or charged in his or her individual capacity, or whether attorneys 
employed by SBA should provide representational assistance for such an 
employee, those attorneys undertake a full and traditional attorney-
client relationship with the employee with respect to the attorney-
client privilege. If representation is authorized, SBA attorneys who 
assist in the representation of an SBA employee also undertake a full 
and traditional attorney-client relationship with the employee with 
respect to the

[[Page 112]]

attorney-client privilege. Unless authorized by the employee, the 
attorney must not disclose to anyone other than attorneys also 
responsible for the employee's representation information communicated 
to the attorney by the client-employee during the course of the 
attorney-client relationship. The attorney-client privilege will 
continue with respect to that information whether or not representation 
is provided, and even if the employee's representation is denied or 
discontinued.

of 1958, as amended. Subpart A of this part contains regulations common 
to both the program requiring prior SBA approval of each bond guarantee 
(the Prior Approval Program) and the program not requiring prior 
approval (the PSB Program). Subpart B of this part contains the 
regulations applicable only to the Prior Approval Program. Subpart C of 
this part contains the regulations applicable only to the PSB Program.


<R05>
Sec. 115.2  Savings clause.

    Transactions affected by this part 115 are governed by the 
regulations in effect at the time they occur.


<R04>
          Subpart A--Provisions for All Surety Bond Guarantees


<R05>
Sec. 115.10  Definitions.

    AA/SG means SBA's Associate Administrator for Surety Guarantees.
    Affiliate is defined in part 121 of this chapter.
    Ancillary Bond means a bond incidental and essential to the 
performance of a Contract for which there is a guaranteed Final Bond.
    Bid Bond means a bond conditioned upon the bidder on a Contract 
entering into the Contract, and furnishing the required Payment and 
Performance Bonds. The term does not include a forfeiture bond unless it 
is issued for a jurisdiction where statute or settled decisional law 
requires forfeiture bonds for public works.

[[Page 113]]

    Contract means a written obligation of the Principal requiring the 
furnishing of services, supplies, labor, materials, machinery, 
equipment, or construction. A Contract must not prohibit a Surety from 
performing the Contract upon default of the Principal. A Contract does 
not include a permit, subdivision contract, lease, land contract, 
evidence of debt, financial guarantee (e.g., a contract requiring any 
payment by the Principal to the Obligee), warranty of performance or 
efficiency, warranty of fidelity, or release of lien (other than for 
claims under a guaranteed bond). It includes a maintenance agreement of 
2 years or less which covers defective workmanship or materials only. 
With SBA's written approval, it can also include a longer maintenance 
agreement covering defective workmanship or materials, or a maintenance 
agreement covering something other than defective workmanship or 
materials. To qualify for such approval, the agreement must be ancillary 
to the Contract for which SBA is guaranteeing a bond, must be required 
to be performed by the same Principal, and must be customarily required 
in the relevant trade or industry.
    Execution means signing by a representative or agent of the Surety 
with the authority and power to bind the Surety.
    Final Bond means a Performance Bond and/or a Payment Bond.
    Imminent Breach means a threat to the successful completion of a 
bonded Contract which, unless remedied by the Surety, makes a default 
under the bond appear to be inevitable.
    Investment Act means the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 (15 
U.S.C. 661 et seq.), as amended.
    Loss has the meaning set forth in Sec. 115.16.
    Obligee means:
    (1)(i) In the case of a Bid Bond, the Person requesting bids for the 
performance of a Contract; or
    (ii) In the case of a Final Bond, the Person who has contracted with 
a Principal for the completion of the Contract and to whom the primary 
obligation of the Surety runs in the event of a breach by the Principal.
    (2) In either case, no Person (other than a Federal department or 
agency) may be named co-Obligee or Obligee on a bond or on a rider to 
the bond unless that Person is bound by the Contract to the Principal 
(or to the Surety, if the Surety has arranged completion of the 
Contract) to the same extent as the original Obligee. In no event may 
the addition of one or more co-Obligees increase the aggregate liability 
of the Surety under the bond.
    OSG means SBA's Office of Surety Guarantees.
    Payment Bond means a bond which is conditioned upon the payment by 
the Principal of money to persons who have a right of action against 
such bond, including those who have furnished labor, materials, 
equipment and supplies for use in the performance of the Contract. A 
Payment Bond can not require the Surety to pay an amount which exceeds 
the claimant's actual loss or damage.
    Performance Bond means a bond conditioned upon the completion by the 
Principal of a Contract in accordance with its terms.
    Person means a natural person or a legal entity.
    Premium means the amount charged by a Surety to issue bonds. The 
Premium is determined by applying an approved rate (see Secs. 115.32(a) 
and 115.60(a)(2)) to the bond or contract amount. The Premium does not 
include surcharges for extra services, whether or not considered part of 
the ``premium'' under local law.
    Principal means, in the case of a Bid Bond, the Person bidding for 
the award of a Contract. In the case of Final Bonds and Ancillary Bonds, 
Principal means the Person primarily liable to complete the Contract, or 
to make Contract-related payments to other persons, and is the Person 
whose performance or payment is bonded by the Surety. A Principal may be 
a prime contractor or a subcontractor.
    Prior Approval Agreement means the Surety Bond Guarantee Agreement 
(SBA Form 990) entered into between a Prior Approval Surety and SBA 
under which SBA agrees to guarantee a specific bond.

    Prior Approval Surety means a Surety which must obtain SBA's prior 
approval on each guarantee and which has entered into one or more Prior 
Approval Agreements with SBA.
    PSB Agreement means the Preferred Surety Bond Guarantee Agreement 
entered into between a PSB Surety and SBA.
    PSB Surety means a Surety that has been admitted to the Preferred 
Surety Bond (PSB) Program.

    (1)(i) Under the terms of a Bid Bond, agrees to pay a sum of money 
to the Obligee if the Principal breaches the conditions of the bond;
    (ii) Under the terms of a Performance Bond, agrees to pay a sum of 
money or to incur the cost of fulfilling the terms of a Contract if the 
Principal breaches the conditions of the Contract; and
    (iii) Under the terms of a Payment or an Ancillary Bond, agrees to 
make payment to all who have a right of action against such bond, 
including those who have furnished labor, materials, equipment and 
supplies in the performance of the Contract.
    (2) The term Surety includes an agent, independent agent, 
underwriter, or any other company or individual empowered to act on 
behalf of the Surety.

<R05>
Sec. 115.11  Applying to participate in the Surety Bond Guarantee Program.

    Sureties interested in participating as Prior Approval Sureties or 
PSB Sureties should apply in writing to the AA/SG at 409 3rd Street, 
SW., Washington, DC 20416. OSG will determine the eligibility of the 
applicant considering its standards and procedures for underwriting, 
administration, claims and recovery. Each applicant must be a 
corporation listed by the U.S. Treasury as eligible to issue bonds in 
connection with Federal procurement contracts.


<R05>
Sec. 115.12  General program policies and provisions.

    (a) Description of Surety Bond Guarantee Programs. SBA guarantees 
Sureties participating in the Surety Bond Guarantee Programs against a 
portion of their Losses incurred and paid as a result of a Principal's 
breach of the terms of a Bid Bond, Final Bond or Ancillary Bond, on any 
eligible Contract. In the Prior Approval Program, the Surety must obtain 
SBA's approval before a guaranteed bond can be issued. In the PSB 
Program, selected Sureties may issue, monitor, and service SBA 
guaranteed bonds without further SBA approval.
    (b) Eligibility of bonds. Bid Bonds and Final Bonds are eligible for 
an SBA guarantee if they are executed in connection with an eligible 
Contract and are of a type listed in the ``Contract Bonds'' section of 
the current Manual of Rules, Procedures and Classifications of the 
Surety Association of America (100 Wood Avenue South, Iselin, New Jersey 
08830). Ancillary Bonds may also be eligible for SBA's guarantee. A 
Performance Bond must not prohibit a Surety from performing the Contract 
upon default of the Principal.
    (c) Expiration of Bid Bond Guarantee. A Bid Bond guarantee expires 
120 days after Execution of the Bid Bond, unless the Surety notifies SBA 
in writing before the 120th day that a later expiration date is 
required. The notification must include the new expiration date.
    (d) Guarantee agreement. The terms and conditions of SBA's bond 
guarantee agreements, including the guarantee percentage, may vary from 
Surety to Surety, depending on past experience with SBA. If the 
guarantee percentage is not fixed by the Investment Act, it is 
determined by OSG after considering, among other things, the rating or 
ranking assigned to the Surety by recognized authority, and the Surety's 
Loss rate, average Contract amount, average bond penalty per guaranteed 
bond, and ratio of Bid Bonds to Final Bonds, all in comparison with 
other Sureties participating in the same SBA Surety Bond Guarantee 
Program (Prior Approval or PSB) to a comparable degree. Any guarantee 
agreement under this part is made exclusively for the benefit of SBA and 
the Surety, and does not confer any rights (such as a right of action 
against SBA) or benefits on any other party.
    (e) Amount of Contract--(1) Statutory ceiling. The amount of the 
Contract to be bonded must not exceed $1,250,000 in

[[Page 115]]

face value at the time of the bond's Execution.
    (2) Aggregation of Contract amounts. The amounts of two or more 
Contracts for a ``single project'' are aggregated to determine the 
Contract amount unless the Contracts are to be performed in phases and 
the prior bond is released before the beginning of each succeeding 
phase. A bond may be considered released even if the warranty period it 
is covering has not yet expired. For purposes of this paragraph, a 
``single project'' means one represented by two or more Contracts of one 
Principal or its Affiliates with one Obligee or its Affiliates for 
performance at the same location, regardless of job title or nature of 
the work to be performed.
    (3) Service and supply contracts. A service or supply Contract 
covering more than a 1 year period is eligible for an SBA guaranteed 
bond if neither the annual Contract amount nor the penal sum of the bond 
exceeds $1,250,000 at any time.
    (f) Transfers or sales by Surety. Sureties must not sell or 
otherwise transfer their files or accounts, whether before or after a 
default by the Principal has occurred, without the prior written 
approval of SBA. A violation of this provision is grounds for 
termination from participation in the program. This provision does not 
apply to the sale of an entire business division, subsidiary or 
operation of the Surety.


<R05>
Sec. 115.13  Eligibility of Principal.

    (a) General eligibility. In order to be eligible for a bond 
guaranteed by SBA, the Principal must comply with the following 
requirements:
    (1) Size. Together with its Affiliates, it must qualify as a small 
business under part 121 of this title.
    (2) Character. It must possess good character and reputation. A 
Principal meets this standard if each owner of 20% or more of its 
equity, and each of its officers, directors, or general partners, 
possesses good character and reputation. A Person's good character and 
reputation is presumed absent when:
    (i) The Person is under indictment for, or has been convicted of a 
felony, or a final civil judgment has been entered stating that such 
Person has committed a breach of trust or has violated a law or 
regulation protecting the integrity of business transactions or business 
relationships; or
    (ii) A regulatory authority has revoked, canceled, or suspended a 
license of the Person which is necessary to perform the Contract; or
    (iii) The Person has obtained a bond guarantee by fraud or material 
misrepresentation (as described in Sec. 115.19(b)), or has failed to 
keep the Surety informed of unbonded contracts or of a contract bonded 
by another Surety, as required by a bonding line commitment under 
Sec. 115.33.
    (3) Need for bond. It must certify that a bond is expressly required 
by the bid solicitation or the original Contract in order to bid on the 
Contract or to serve as a prime contractor or subcontractor.
    (4) Availability of bond. It must certify that a bond is not 
obtainable on reasonable terms and conditions without SBA's guarantee.
    (5) Partial subcontract. It must certify the percentage of work 
under the Contract to be subcontracted. SBA will not guarantee bonds for 
Principals who are primarily brokers or who have effectively transferred 
control over the project to one or more subcontractors.
    (6) Debarment. It must certify that the Principal is not presently 
debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, declared ineligible, or 
voluntarily excluded from transactions with any Federal department or 
agency, under governmentwide debarment and suspension rules.
    (b) Conflict of interest. A Principal is not eligible for an SBA-
guaranteed bond issued by a particular Surety if that Surety, or an 
Affiliate of that Surety, or a close relative or member of the household 
of that Surety or Affiliate owns, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of 
the Principal. This prohibition also applies to ownership interests in 
any of the Principal's Affiliates.


<R05>
Sec. 115.14  Loss of Principal's eligibility for future assistance.

    (a) Ineligibility. A Principal and its Affiliates lose eligibility 
for further SBA bond guarantees if any of the following occurs under an 
SBA-guaranteed bond issued on behalf of the Principal:

[[Page 116]]

    (1) Legal action under the guaranteed bond has been initiated.
    (2) The Obligee has declared the Principal to be in default under 
the Contract.
    (3) The Surety has established a claim reserve for the bond of at 
least $1000.
    (4) The Surety has requested reimbursement for Losses incurred under 
the bond.
    (5) The guarantee fee has not been paid by the Principal.
    (6) The Principal committed fraud or material misrepresentation in 
obtaining the guaranteed bond.
    (b) Reinstatement of Principal's eligibility. Prior Approval 
Sureties should refer to Sec. 115.36(b) for provisions on reinstatement 
of the Principal's eligibility. A PSB Surety may reinstate a Principal's 
eligibility upon the Surety's determination that reinstatement is 
appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 115.15  Underwriting and servicing standards.

    (a) Underwriting. (1) Sureties must evaluate the credit, capacity, 
and character of a Principal using standards generally accepted by the 
surety industry and in accordance with SBA's Standard Operating 
Procedures on underwriting and the Surety's principles and practices on 
unguaranteed bonds. The Principal must satisfy the eligibility 
requirements set forth in Sec. 115.13. The Surety must reasonably expect 
that the Principal will successfully perform the Contract to be bonded.
    (2) The terms and conditions of the bond and the Contract must be 
reasonable in light of the risks involved and the extent of the Surety's 
participation. The bond must satisfy the eligibility requirements set 
forth in Sec. 115.12(b). The Surety must be satisfied as to the 
reasonableness of cost and the feasibility of successful completion of 
the Contract.
    (b) Servicing. The Surety must ensure that the Principal remains 
viable and eligible for SBA's Surety Bond Guarantee Program, must 
monitor the Principal's progress on bonded Contracts guaranteed by SBA, 
and must request job status reports from Obligees of Final Bonds 
guaranteed by SBA. Documentation of the job status requests must be 
maintained by the Surety.


<R05>
Sec. 115.16  Determination of Surety's Loss.

    Loss is determined as follows:
    (a) Loss under a Bid Bond is the lesser of the penal sum or the 
amount which is the difference between the bonded bid and the next 
higher responsive bid. In either case, the Loss is reduced by any 
amounts the Surety recovers by reason of the Principal's defenses 
against the Obligee's demand for performance by the Principal and any 
sums the Surety recovers from indemnitors and other salvage.
    (b) Loss under a Payment Bond is, at the Surety's option, the sum 
necessary to pay all just and timely claims against the Principal for 
the value of labor, materials, equipment and supplies furnished for use 
in the performance of the bonded Contract and other covered debts, or 
the penal sum of the Payment Bond. In either case, the Loss includes 
interest (if any), but Loss is reduced by any amounts recovered (through 
offset or otherwise) by reason of the Principal's claims against 
laborers, materialmen, subcontractors, suppliers, or other rightful 
claimants, and by any amounts recovered from indemnitors and other 
salvage.
    (c) Loss under a Performance Bond is, at the Surety's option, the 
sum necessary to meet the cost of fulfilling the terms of a bonded 
Contract or the penal sum of the bond. In either case, the Loss includes 
interest (if any), but Loss is reduced by any amounts recovered (through 
offset or otherwise) by reason of the Principal's defenses or causes of 
action against the Obligee, and by any amounts recovered from 
indemnitors and other salvage.
    (d) Loss under an Ancillary Bond is the amount covered by such bond 
which is attributable to the Contract for which guaranteed Final Bonds 
were Executed.
    (e) Loss includes the following expenses if they are itemized, 
documented and attributable solely to the Loss under the guaranteed 
bond:
    (1) Amounts actually paid by the Surety which are specifically 
allocable to the investigation, adjustment, negotiation, compromise, 
settlement of, or resistance to a claim for Loss resulting

[[Page 117]]

from the breach of the terms of the bonded Contract. Any cost allocation 
method must be reasonable and must comply with generally accepted 
accounting principles; and
    (2) Amounts actually paid by the Surety for court costs and 
reasonable attorney's fees incurred to mitigate any Loss under 
paragraphs (a) through (e)(1) of this section including suits to obtain 
sums due from Obligees, indemnitors, Principals and others.
    (f) Loss does not include the following expenses:
    (1) Any unallocated expenses, or any clear mark-up on expenses or 
any overhead, of the Surety, its attorney, or any other party hired by 
the Surety or the attorney;
    (2) Expenses paid for any suits, cross-claims, or counterclaims 
filed against the United States of America or any of its agencies, 
officers, or employees unless the Surety has received, prior to filing 
such suit or claim, written concurrence from SBA that the suit may be 
filed;
    (3) Attorney's fees and court costs incurred by the Surety in a suit 
by or against SBA or its Administrator; and
    (4) Fees, costs, or other payments, including tort damages, arising 
from a successful tort suit or claim by a Principal or any other Person 
against the Surety.


<R05>
Sec. 115.17  Minimization of Surety's Loss.

    (a) Indemnity agreements and collateral--(1) Requirements. The 
Surety must take all reasonable action to minimize risk of Loss 
including, but not limited to, obtaining from each Principal a written 
indemnity agreement which covers actual Losses under the Contract and 
Imminent Breach payments under Sec. 115.34(a) or Sec. 115.69. The 
indemnity agreement must be secured by such collateral as the Surety or 
SBA finds appropriate. Indemnity agreements from other Persons, secured 
or unsecured, may also be required by the Surety or SBA.
    (2) Prohibitions. No indemnity agreement may be obtained from the 
Surety, its agent or any other representative of the Surety. The Surety 
must not separately collateralize the portion of its bond which is not 
guaranteed by SBA.
    (b) Salvage and recovery--(1) General. The Surety must pursue all 
possible sources of salvage and recovery. Salvage and recovery includes 
all payments made in settlement of the Surety's claim, even though the 
Surety has incurred other losses as a result of that Principal which are 
not reimbursable by SBA.
    (2) SBA's share. SBA is entitled to its guaranteed percentage of all 
salvage and recovery from a defaulted Principal, its guarantors and 
indemnitors, and any other party, received by the Surety in connection 
with the guaranteed bond or any other bond issued by the Surety on 
behalf of the Principal unless such recovery is unquestionably 
identifiable as related solely to the non-guaranteed bond. The Surety 
must reimburse or credit SBA (in the same proportion as SBA's share of 
Loss) within 90 days of receipt of any recovery by the Surety.
    (3) Multiple Sureties. In any dispute between two or more Sureties 
concerning recovery under SBA guaranteed bonds, the dispute must first 
be brought to the attention of OSG for an attempt at mediation and 
settlement.


<R05>
Sec. 115.18  Refusal to issue further guarantees; suspension and termination of PSB status.

    (a) Improper surety bond guarantee practices--(1) Imprudent 
practices. SBA may refuse to issue further guarantees to a Prior 
Approval Surety or may suspend the preferred status of a PSB Surety, by 
written notice stating all reasons for such decision and the effective 
date. Reasons for such a decision include, but are not limited to, a 
determination that the Surety (in its underwriting, its efforts to 
minimize Loss, its claims or recovery practices, or its documentation 
related to SBA guaranteed bonds) has failed to adhere to prudent 
standards or practices, including any standards or practices required by 
SBA, as compared to those of other Sureties participating in the same 
SBA Surety Bond Guarantee Program to a comparable degree.
    (2) Regulatory violations, fraud. Acts of wrongdoing such as fraud, 
material misrepresentation, breach of the Prior Approval or PSB 
Agreement, or regulatory violations (as defined in

[[Page 118]]

Sec. Sec. 115.19(d) and 115.19(h)) also constitute sufficient grounds 
for refusal to issue further guarantees, or in the case of a PSB Surety, 
termination of preferred status.
    (3) Audit; records. The failure of a Surety to consent to SBA's 
audit or to maintain and produce records constitutes grounds for SBA to 
refuse to issue further guarantees for a Prior Approval Surety, to 
suspend a PSB Surety from participation, and to refuse to honor claims 
submitted by a Prior Approval or PSB Surety until the Surety consents to 
the audit.
    (4) Excessive Losses. If a Surety experiences excessive Losses on 
SBA guaranteed bonds relative to those of other Sureties participating 
in the same SBA Surety Bond Guarantee Program to a comparable degree, 
SBA may also require the renegotiation of the guarantee percentage and/
or SBA's charge to the Surety for bonds executed thereafter.
    (b) Lack of business integrity. A Surety's participation in the 
Surety Bond Guarantee Programs may be denied, suspended, or terminated 
upon the occurrence of any event in paragraphs (b) (1) through (5) of 
this section involving any of the following Persons: The Surety or any 
of its officers, directors, partners, or other individuals holding at 
least 20% of the Surety's voting securities, and any agents, 
underwriters, or any individual empowered to act on behalf of any of the 
preceding Persons.
    (1) If a State or other authority has revoked, canceled, or 
suspended the license required of such Person to engage in the surety 
business, the right of such Person to participate in the SBA Surety Bond 
Guarantee Program may be denied, terminated, or suspended, as 
applicable, in that jurisdiction or in other jurisdictions. 
Ineligibility or suspension from the Surety Bond Guarantee Programs is 
for at least the duration of the license suspension.
    (2) If such Person has been indicted or otherwise formally charged 
with a misdemeanor or felony bearing on such Person's fitness to 
participate in the Surety Bond Guarantee Programs, the participation of 
such Person may be suspended pending disposition of the charge. Upon 
conviction, participation may be denied or terminated.
    (3) If a final civil judgment is entered holding that such Person 
has committed a breach of trust or violation of a law or regulation 
protecting the integrity of business transactions or relationships, 
participation may be denied or terminated.
    (4) If such Person has made a material misrepresentation or 
willfully false statement in the presentation of oral or written 
information to SBA in connection with an application for a surety bond 
guarantee or the presentation of a claim, or committed a material breach 
of the Prior Approval or PSB Agreement or a material violation of the 
regulations (all as described in Sec. 115.19), participation may be 
denied or terminated.
    (5) If such Person is debarred, suspended, voluntarily excluded 
from, or declared ineligible for participation in Federal programs, 
participation may be denied or terminated.
    (c) Notification requirement. The Prior Approval or PSB Surety must 
promptly notify SBA of the occurrence of any event in paragraphs (b) (1) 
through (5) of this section, or if any of the Persons described in 
paragraph (b) of this section does not, or ceases to, qualify as a 
Surety. SBA may require submission of a Statement of Personal History 
(SBA Form 912) from any of these Persons.
    (d) SBA proceedings. Decisions to suspend, terminate, deny 
participation in, or deny reinstatement in the Surety Bond Guarantee 
program are made by the AA/SG. A Surety may file a petition for review 
of suspensions and terminations with the SBA Office of Hearings and 
Appeals (OHA) under part 134 of this chapter. SBA's Administrator may, 
pending a decision pursuant to part 134 of this chapter, suspend the 
participation of any Surety for any of the causes listed in paragraphs 
(b) (1) through (5) of this section.
    (e) Effect on guarantee. A guarantee issued by SBA before a 
suspension or termination under this section remains in effect, subject 
to SBA's right to deny liability under the guarantee.


<R05>
Sec. 115.19  Denial of liability.

    In addition to equitable and legal defenses and remedies under 
contract

[[Page 119]]

law, the Act and the regulations in this part, SBA is not liable under a 
Prior Approval or PSB Agreement if any of the circumstances in 
paragraphs (a) through (h) of this section exist.
    (a) Excess Contract or bond amount. The total Contract amount at the 
time of Execution of the bond exceeds $1,250,000 in face value (see 
Sec. 115.12(e)), or the bond amount at any time exceeds the total 
Contract amount.
    (b) Misrepresentation or fraud. The Surety obtained the Prior 
Approval or PSB Agreement, or applied for reimbursement for losses, by 
fraud or material misrepresentation. Material misrepresentation includes 
(but is not limited to) both the making of an untrue statement of 
material fact and the omission of a statement of material fact necessary 
to make a statement not misleading in light of the circumstances in 
which it was made. Material misrepresentation also includes the adoption 
by the Surety of a material misstatement made by others which the Surety 
knew or under generally accepted underwriting standards should have 
known to be false or misleading. The Surety's failure to disclose its 
ownership (or the ownership by any owner of at least 20% of the Surety's 
equity) of an interest in a Principal or an Obligee is considered the 
omission of a statement of material fact.
    (c) Material breach. The Surety has committed a material breach of 
one or more terms or conditions of its Prior Approval or PSB Agreement. 
A material breach is considered to have occurred if:
    (1) Such breach (or such breaches in the aggregate) causes an 
increase in the Contract amount or in the bond amount of at least 25% or 
$50,000; or
    (2) One of the conditions under Part B of Title IV of the Investment 
Act is not met.
    (d) Substantial regulatory violation. The Surety has committed a 
``substantial violation'' of SBA regulations. For purposes of this 
paragraph, a ``substantial violation'' is a violation which causes an 
increase in the bond amount of at least 25% or $50,000 in the aggregate, 
or is contrary to the purposes of the Surety Bond Guarantee Programs.
    (e) Alteration. Without obtaining prior written approval from SBA 
(which may be conditioned upon payment of additional fees), the Surety 
agrees to or acquiesces in any material alteration in the terms, 
conditions, or provisions of the bond, including but not limited to the 
following acts:
    (1) Naming as an Obligee or co-Obligee any Person that does not 
qualify as an Obligee under Sec. 115.10; or
    (2) In the case of a Prior Approval Surety, acquiescing in any 
alteration to the bond which would increase the bond amount by at least 
25% or $50,000.
    (f) Timeliness. (1) Either:
    (i) The bond was Executed prior to the date of SBA's guarantee; or
    (ii) The bond was Executed (or approved, if the Surety is legally 
bound by such approval) after the work under the Contract had begun, 
unless SBA executes a ``Surety Bond Guarantee Agreement Addendum'' (SBA 
Form 991) after receiving all of the following from the Surety:
    (A) Satisfactory evidence, including a certified copy of the 
Contract (or a sworn affidavit from the Principal), showing that the 
bond requirement was contained in the original Contract, or other 
documentation satisfactory to SBA, showing why a bond was not previously 
obtained and is now being required;
    (B) Certification by the Principal that all taxes and labor costs 
are current, and listing all suppliers and subcontractors, indicating 
that they are all paid to date, and attaching a waiver of lien from 
each; or an explanation satisfactory to SBA why such documentation 
cannot be produced; and
    (C) Certification by the Obligee that all payments due under the 
Contract to date have been made and that the job has been satisfactorily 
completed to date.
    (2)(i) For purposes of paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section, work 
under a Contract is considered to have begun when a Principal takes any 
action at the job site which would have exposed its Surety to liability 
under applicable law had a bond been Executed (or approved, if the 
Surety is legally bound by such approval) at the time.

[[Page 120]]

    (ii) For purposes of this paragraph (f), the Surety must maintain a 
contemporaneous record of the Execution and approval of each bond.
    (g) Principal fee. The Surety has not remitted to SBA the 
Principal's payment for the full amount of the guarantee fee within the 
time period required under Sec. 115.30(d) for Prior Approval Sureties or 
Sec. 115.66 for PSB Sureties. SBA may reinstate the guarantee upon a 
showing that the Contract is not in default and that a valid reason 
exists why a timely submission was not made.
    (h) Other regulatory violations. The occurrence of any of the 
following:
    (1) The Principal on the bonded Contract is not a small business;
    (2) The bond was not required under the bid solicitation or the 
original Contract;
    (3) The bond was not eligible for guarantee by SBA because the 
bonded contract was not a Contract as defined in Sec. 115.10;
    (4) The loss occurred under a bond that was not guaranteed by SBA;
    (5) The loss incurred by the Surety was not a Loss as determined 
under Sec. 115.16; or
    (6) The Surety's loss under a Performance Bond did not result from 
the Principal's breach or Imminent Breach of the Contract.


<R05>
Sec. 115.20  Insolvency of Surety.

    (a) Successor in interest. If a Surety becomes insolvent, all rights 
or benefits conferred on the Surety under a valid and binding Prior 
Approval or PSB Agreement will accrue only to the trustee or receiver of 
the Surety. SBA will not be liable to the trustee or receiver of the 
insolvent Surety except for the guaranteed portion of any Loss incurred 
and actually paid by such Surety or its trustee or receiver under the 
guaranteed bonds.
    (b) Filing requirement. The trustee or receiver must submit to SBA 
quarterly status reports accounting for all funds received and all 
settlements being considered.


<R05>
Sec. 115.21  Audits and investigations.

    (a) Audits--(1) Scope of audit. SBA may audit in the office of a 
Prior Approval or PSB Surety, the Surety's attorneys or consultants, or 
the Principal or its subcontractors, all documents, files, books, 
records, tapes, disks and other material relevant to SBA's guarantee, 
commitments to guarantee a surety bond, or agreements to indemnify the 
Prior Approval or PSB Surety. See Sec. 115.18(a)(3) for consequences of 
failure to comply with this section.
    (2) Frequency of PSB audits. Each PSB Surety is subject to audit at 
least once each year by examiners selected and approved by SBA.
    (b) Records. The Surety must maintain the records listed in this 
paragraph (b) for the term of each bond, plus any additional time 
required to settle any claims of the Surety for reimbursement from SBA 
and to attempt salvage or other recovery, plus an additional 3 years. If 
there are any unresolved audit findings in relation to a particular 
bond, the Surety must maintain the related records until the findings 
are resolved. The records to be maintained include the following:
    (1) A copy of the bond;
    (2) A copy of the bonded Contract;
    (3) All documentation submitted by the Principal in applying for the 
bond;
    (4) All information gathered by the Surety in reviewing the 
Principal's application;
    (5) All documentation of any of the events set forth in 
Sec. 115.35(a) or Sec. 115.65(c)(2);
    (6) All records of any transaction for which the Surety makes 
payment under or in connection with the bond, including but not limited 
to claims, bills (including lawyers' and consultants' bills), judgments, 
settlement agreements and court or arbitration decisions, consultants' 
reports, Contracts and receipts;
    (7) All documentation relating to efforts to mitigate Losses, 
including documentation required by Sec. 115.34(a) or Sec. 115.69 
concerning Imminent Breach;
    (8) All records of any accounts into which fees and funds obtained 
in mitigation of Losses were paid and from which payments were made 
under the bond, and any other trust accounts, and any reconciliations of 
such accounts;
    (9) Job status reports received from Obligees and documentation of 
each

[[Page 121]]

unanswered request for a job status report; and
    (10) All documentation relating to any collateral held by or 
available to the Surety.
    (c) Purpose of audit. SBA's audit will determine, but not be limited 
to:
    (1) The adequacy and sufficiency of the Surety's underwriting and 
credit analysis, its documentation of claims and claims settlement 
procedures and activities, and its recovery procedures and practices;
    (2) The Surety's minimization of Loss, including the exercise of 
bond options upon Contract default; and
    (3) The Surety's loss ratio in comparison with other Sureties 
participating in the same SBA Surety Bond Guarantee Program to a 
comparable degree.
    (d) Investigations. SBA may conduct investigations to inquire into 
the possible violation by any Person of the Small Business Act or the 
Investment Act, or of any rule or regulation under those Acts, or of any 
order issued under those Acts, or of any Federal law relating to 
programs and operations of SBA.


<R04>
             Subpart B--Guarantees Subject to Prior Approval


<R05>
Sec. 115.30  Submission of Surety's guarantee application.

    (a) Legal effect of application. By submitting an application to SBA 
for a bond guarantee, the Prior Approval Surety certifies that the 
Principal meets the eligibility requirements set forth in Sec. 115.13 
and that the underwriting standards set forth in Sec. 115.15 have been 
met.
    (b) SBA's determination. SBA's approval or decline of a guarantee 
application is made in writing by an authorized SBA officer. The officer 
may provide telephone notice before the Prior Approval Surety receives 
SBA's guarantee approval form if the officer has already signed the 
form. In the event of a conflict between the telephone notice and the 
written form, the written form controls.
    (c) Reconsideration-appeal of SBA determination. A Prior Approval 
Surety may request reconsideration of a decline from the SBA officer who 
made the decision. If the decision on reconsideration is negative, the 
Surety may appeal to an individual designated by the AA/SG. If the 
decision is again adverse, the Surety may appeal to the AA/SG, who will 
make the final decision.
    (d) Notice and payment to SBA. When the Surety has Executed a Final 
Bond, including a Final Bond under a bonding line, the Surety must 
complete the Prior Approval Agreement, and submit the form, together 
with the Principal's payment for its guarantee fee (see Sec. 115.32(b)) 
to SBA within 45 days, or in the case of a bonding line, within 15 
business days (see Sec. 115.33(d)(2)) after Execution of the bond.


<R05>
Sec. 115.31  Guarantee percentage.

    (a) Ninety percent. SBA reimburses a Prior Approval Surety for 90% 
of the Loss incurred and paid if:
    (1) The total amount of the Contract at the time of Execution of the 
bond is $100,000 or less; or
    (2) The bond was issued on behalf of a small business owned and 
controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. See 
part 124 of this chapter for applicable definitions and criteria.
    (b) Eighty percent. SBA reimburses a Prior Approval Surety in an 
amount not to exceed 80% of the Loss incurred and paid on bonds for 
Contracts in excess of $100,000 which are executed on behalf of non-
disadvantaged concerns.
    (c) Contract increase to over $100,000. If the Contract amount 
increases to more than $100,000 after Execution of the bond, the 
guarantee percentage decreases by one percentage point for each $5,000 
of increase or part thereof, but it does not decrease below 80%. This 
provision applies only to guarantees which qualify under paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section.
    (d) Contract increase to over $1,250,000. If the Contract amount 
increases above the statutory limit of $1,250,000 after Execution of the 
bond, SBA's share of the Loss is limited to that percentage of the 
increased Contract amount which the statutory limit represents, 
multiplied by the guarantee percentage approved by SBA. For example, if 
a Contract amount increases to $1,375,000, SBA's share of the Loss under 
an 80% guarantee is limited to

[[Page 122]]

72.73% [1,250,000 / 1,375,000=90.91% x 80%=72.73%].
    (e) Contract decrease to $100,000 or less. If the Contract amount 
decreases to $100,000 or less after Execution of the bond, SBA's 
guarantee percentage increases to 90% if the Surety provides SBA with 
evidence supporting the decrease and any other information or documents 
requested.


<R05>
Sec. 115.32  Fees and Premiums.

    (a) Surety's Premium. A Prior Approval Surety must not charge a 
Principal an amount greater than that authorized by the appropriate 
insurance department. The Surety must not require the Principal to 
purchase casualty or other insurance or any other services from the 
Surety or any Affiliate or agent of the Surety. The Surety must not 
charge non-Premium fees to a Principal unless the Surety performs other 
services for the Principal, the additional fee is permitted by State 
law, and the Principal agrees to the fee.
    (b) SBA charge to Principal. SBA does not charge Principals 
application or Bid Bond guarantee fees. If SBA guarantees a Final Bond, 
the Principal must pay a guarantee fee equal to a certain percentage of 
the Contract amount. The percentage is determined by SBA and is 
published in Notices in the Federal Register from time to time. The 
Principal's fee is rounded to the nearest dollar and is to be remitted 
to SBA by the Surety together with the form required under 
Sec. 115.30(d). See paragraph (d) of this section for additional 
requirements when the Contract amount changes.
    (c) SBA charge to Surety. SBA does not charge Sureties application 
or Bid Bond guarantee fees. Subject to Sec. 115.18(a)(4), the Surety 
must pay SBA a guarantee fee on each guaranteed bond (other than a Bid 
Bond) in the ordinary course of business. The fee is a certain 
percentage of the bond Premium, determined by SBA and published in 
Notices in the Federal Register from time to time. The fee is rounded to 
the nearest dollar. SBA does not receive any portion of a Surety's non-
Premium charges. See paragraph (d) of this section for additional 
requirements when the bond amount or the Contract amount changes.
    (d) Contract or bond increases/decreases--(1) Notification and 
approval. The Prior Approval Surety must notify SBA of any increases or 
decreases in the Contract or bond amount that aggregate 25% or $50,000, 
as soon as the Surety acquires knowledge of the change. Whenever the 
original bond amount increases as a result of a single change order of 
at least 25% or $50,000, the prior written approval of such increase by 
SBA is required on a supplemental Prior Approval Agreement (Supplemental 
Form 990) and is conditioned upon payment by the Surety of the increase 
in the Principal's guarantee fee as set forth in paragraph (d)(2) of 
this section.
    (2) Increases; fees. Notification of increases in the Contract or 
bond amount under this paragraph (d) must be accompanied by payment of 
the increase in the Principal's guarantee fee computed on the increase 
in the Contract amount. If the increase in the Principal's fee is less 
than $40, such increase is not due until all unpaid increases in the 
Principal's fee aggregate at least $40. The Surety's check for payment 
of the increase in the Surety's guarantee fee, computed on the increase 
in the bond Premium, may be submitted in the ordinary course of 
business. Increases in the Surety's fee are not due until they aggregate 
at least $40.
    (3) Decreases; refunds. Whenever SBA is notified of a decrease in 
the Contract or bond amount, SBA will refund to the Principal a 
proportionate amount of the Principal's guarantee fee and rebate to the 
Surety a proportionate amount of SBA's Premium share in the ordinary 
course of business. If the amount to be refunded or rebated is less than 
$40, such refund or rebate will not be made until the amounts to be 
refunded or rebated, respectively, aggregate at least $40. Upon receipt 
of the refund, the Surety must promptly pay a proportionate amount of 
its Premium to the Principal.


<R05>
Sec. 115.33  Surety bonding line.

    A surety bonding line is a written commitment by SBA to a Prior 
Approval Surety which provides for the Surety's Execution of multiple 
bonds for a specified small business strictly

[[Page 123]]

within pre-approved terms, conditions and limitations. In applying for a 
bonding line, the Surety must provide SBA with information on the 
applicant as requested. In addition to the other limitations and 
provisions set forth in this part 115, the following conditions apply to 
each surety bonding line:
    (a) Underwriting. A bonding line may be issued by SBA for a 
Principal only if the underwriting evaluation is satisfactory. The Prior 
Approval Surety must require the Principal to keep it informed of all 
its contracts, whether bonded by the same or another surety or unbonded, 
during the term of the bonding line.
    (b) Bonding line conditions. The bonding line contains limitations 
on the following:
    (1) The term of the bonding line, not to exceed 1 year subject to 
renewal in writing;
    (2) The total dollar amount of the Principal's bonded and unbonded 
work on hand at any time, including outstanding bids, during the term of 
the bonding line;
    (3) The number of such bonded and unbonded contracts outstanding at 
any time during the term of the bonding line;
    (4) The maximum dollar amount of any single guaranteed bonded 
Contract;
    (5) The timing of Execution of bonds under the bonding line--bonds 
must be dated and Executed before the work on the underlying Contract 
has begun, or the Surety must submit to SBA the documentation required 
under Sec. 115.19(f)(1)(ii); and
    (6) Any other limitation related to type, specialty of work, 
geographical area, or credit.
    (c) Excess bonding. If, after a bonding line is issued, the 
Principal desires a bond and the Surety desires a guarantee exceeding a 
limitation of the bonding line, the Surety must submit an application to 
SBA under regular procedures.
    (d) Submission of forms to SBA--(1) Bid Bonds. Within 15 business 
days after the Execution of any Bid Bonds under a bonding line, the 
Surety must submit a ``Surety Bond Guarantee Underwriting Review'' (SBA 
Form 994B) to SBA for approval. If that form is already on file with SBA 
and no new financial statements are required or have been received from 
the Principal, a ``Surety Bond Guarantee Review Update'' (SBA Form 994C) 
may be submitted instead. If the Surety fails to submit either form 
within this time period, SBA's guarantee of the bond will be void from 
its inception unless SBA determines otherwise upon a showing that a 
valid reason exists why the timely submission was not made.
    (2) Final Bonds. Within 15 business days after the Execution of any 
Final Bonds under a bonding line, the Surety must submit a signed Prior 
Approval Agreement and a ``Surety Bond Guarantee Underwriting Review'' 
(SBA Form 994B) to SBA for approval. If that form is already on file 
with SBA and no new financial statements are required or have been 
received from the Principal, a ``Surety Bond Guarantee Review Update'' 
(SBA Form 994C) may be submitted instead. If the Surety fails to submit 
these forms together with the Principal's payment for its guarantee fee 
within this time period, SBA's guarantee of the bond will be void from 
its inception unless SBA determines otherwise upon a showing that the 
Contract is not in default and a valid reason exists why the timely 
submission was not made.
    (3) Additional information. The Surety must submit any other data 
SBA requests.
    (e) Cancellation of bonding line--(1) Optional cancellation. Either 
SBA or the Surety may cancel a bonding line at any time, with or without 
cause, upon written notice to the other party. Upon the receipt of any 
adverse information concerning the Principal, the Surety must promptly 
notify SBA, and SBA may cancel the bonding line.
    (2) Mandatory cancellation. Upon the occurrence of a default by the 
Principal, whether under a contract bonded by the same or another surety 
or an unbonded contract, the Surety must immediately cancel the bonding 
line.
    (3) Effect of cancellation. Cancellation of a bonding line by SBA is 
effective upon receipt of written notice by the Surety. Bonds issued 
before the effective date of cancellation remain guaranteed by SBA. Upon 
cancellation by SBA or the Surety, the Surety must

[[Page 124]]

promptly notify the Principal in writing.


<R05>
Sec. 115.34  Minimization of Surety's Loss.

    (a) Imminent Breach--(1) Prior approval requirement. SBA will 
reimburse its guaranteed share of payments made by a Surety to avoid or 
attempt to avoid an Imminent Breach of the terms of a Contract covered 
by an SBA guaranteed bond only if the payments were made with the prior 
approval of OSG. OSG's prior approval will be given only if the Surety 
demonstrates to SBA's satisfaction that a breach is imminent and that 
there is no other recourse to prevent such breach.
    (2) Amount of reimbursement. The aggregate of the payments by SBA to 
avoid Imminent Breach cannot exceed 10% of the Contract amount, unless 
the Administrator finds that a greater payment (not to exceed the 
guaranteed share of the bond penalty) is necessary and reasonable. In no 
event will SBA make any duplicate payment pursuant to this or any other 
provision of this part 115.
    (3) Recordkeeping requirement. The Surety must keep records of 
payments made to avoid Imminent Breach.
    (b) Salvage and recovery. A Prior Approval Surety must pursue all 
possible sources of salvage and recovery until SBA concurs with the 
Surety's recommendation for a discontinuance or for a settlement. The 
Surety must certify that continued pursuit of salvage and recovery would 
be neither economically feasible nor a viable strategy in maximizing 
recovery. See also Sec. 115.17(b).


<R05>
Sec. 115.35  Claims for reimbursement of Losses.

    (a) Notification requirements--(1) Events requiring notification. A 
Prior Approval Surety must notify OSG of the occurrence of any of the 
following:
    (i) Legal action under the bond has been initiated.
    (ii) The Obligee has declared the Principal to be in default under 
the Contract.
    (iii) The Surety has established a claim reserve for the bond.
    (iv) The Surety has received any adverse information concerning the 
Principal's financial condition or possible inability to complete the 
project or to pay laborers or suppliers.
    (2) Timing of notification. Notification must be made in writing at 
the earlier of the time the Surety applies for a guarantee on behalf of 
an affected Principal, or within 30 days of the date the Surety acquires 
knowledge, or should have acquired knowledge, of any of the listed 
events.
    (b) Surety action. The Surety must take all necessary steps to 
mitigate Losses resulting from any of the events in paragraph (a) of 
this section, including the disposal at fair market value of any 
collateral held by or available to the Surety. Unless SBA notifies the 
Surety otherwise, the Surety must take charge of all claims or suits 
arising from a defaulted bond, and compromise, settle and defend such 
suits. The Surety must handle and process all claims under the bond and 
all settlements and recoveries as it does on non-guaranteed bonds.
    (c) Claim reimbursement requests. (1) Claims for reimbursement for 
Losses which the Surety has paid must be submitted (together with a copy 
of the bond, the bonded Contract, and any indemnity agreements) with the 
initial claim to OSG on a ``Default Report, Claim for Reimbursement and 
Record of Administrative Action'' (SBA Form 994H), within 1 year from 
the time of each disbursement. Claims submitted after 1 year must be 
accompanied by substantiation satisfactory to SBA. The date of the claim 
for reimbursement is the date of receipt of the claim by SBA, or such 
later date as additional information requested by SBA is received.
    (2) The Surety must also submit evidence of the disposal of all 
collateral at fair market value.
    (3) SBA may request additional information prior to reimbursing the 
Surety for its Loss.
    (4) Subject to the offset provisions of part 140, SBA pays its share 
of the Loss incurred and paid by the Surety within 90 days of receipt of 
the requisite information.
    (5) Claims for reimbursement and any additional information 
submitted are subject to review and audit by SBA, including but not 
limited to the Surety's

[[Page 125]]

compliance with SBA's regulations and forms.
    (d) Status updates. The Surety must submit semiannual status reports 
on each claim 6 months after the initial default notice, and then every 
6 months. The Surety must notify SBA immediately of any substantial 
changes in the status of the claim or the amounts of Loss reserves.
    (e) Reservation of SBA rights. The payment by SBA of a Surety's 
claim does not waive or invalidate any of the terms of the Prior 
Approval Agreement, the regulations set forth in this part 115, or any 
defense SBA may have against the Surety. Within 30 days of receipt of 
notification that a claim or any portion of a claim should not have been 
paid by SBA, the Surety must repay the specified amounts to SBA.


<R05>
Sec. 115.36  Indemnity settlements and reinstatement of Principal.

    (a) Indemnity settlements. (1) An indemnity settlement occurs when a 
defaulted Principal and its Surety agree upon an amount, less than the 
actual loss under the bond, which will satisfy the Principal's 
indebtedness to the Surety. Sureties must not agree to any indemnity 
settlement proposal or enter into any such agreement without SBA's 
concurrence.
    (2) Any settlement proposal submitted for SBA's consideration must 
include current financial information, including financial statements, 
tax returns, and credit reports, together with the Surety's written 
recommendations. It should also indicate whether the Principal is 
interested in further bonding.
    (3) The Surety must pay SBA its pro rata share of the settlement 
amount within 90 days of receipt. Prior to closing the file on a 
Principal, the Surety must certify that SBA has received its pro rata 
share of all indemnity recovery.
    (b) Conditions for reinstatement. At any time after a Principal 
becomes ineligible for further bond guarantees under Sec. 115.14(a), the 
Surety may recommend that such Principal's eligibility be reinstated. 
OSG may agree to reinstate the Principal and its Affiliates if:
    (1) The Principal's guarantee fee has been paid to SBA and SBA 
receives evidence that the Principal has paid all delinquent amounts due 
to the Surety (including amounts for Imminent Breach); or
    (2) The Surety has settled its claim with the Principal for an 
amount and on terms accepted by OSG; or
    (3) The Principal contests a claim and provides collateral, 
acceptable to the Surety and OSG, which has a liquidation value of at 
least the amount of the claim including related expenses; or
    (4) The Principal's indebtedness to the Surety is discharged by 
operation of law (e.g., bankruptcy discharge); or
    (5) OSG and the Surety determine that further bond guarantees are 
appropriate.
    (c) Underwriting after reinstatement. A guarantee application 
submitted after reinstatement of the Principal's eligibility is subject 
to a very stringent underwriting review.


<R04>
            Subpart C--Preferred Surety Bond (PSB) Guarantees


<R05>
Sec. 115.60  Selection and admission of PSB Sureties.

    (a) Selection of PSB Sureties. SBA's selection of PSB Sureties will 
be guided by, but not limited to, these factors:
    (1) An underwriting limitation of at least $1,250,000 on the U.S. 
Treasury Department list of acceptable sureties;
    (2) An agreement to charge Principals no more than the Surety 
Association of America's advisory premium rates in effect on August 1, 
1987;
    (3) Premium income from contract bonds guaranteed by any government 
agency (Federal, State or local) of no more than one- quarter of the 
total contract bond premium income of the Surety;
    (4) The vesting of underwriting authority for SBA guaranteed bonds 
only in employees of the Surety;
    (5) The vesting of final settlement authority for claims and 
recovery under the PSB program only in employees of the Surety's 
permanent claims department; and
    (6) The rating or ranking designations assigned to the Surety by 
recognized authority.

[[Page 126]]

    (b) Admission of PSB Sureties. A Surety admitted to the PSB program 
must execute a PSB Agreement before approving SBA guaranteed bonds. No 
SBA guarantee attaches to bonds approved before the AA/SG or designee 
has countersigned the Agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 115.61  Duration of PSB program.

    The PSB program terminates on September 30, 2000, unless extended by 
legislation. SBA guarantees effective under this program on or before 
September 30, 2000, will remain in effect after such date.

[61 FR 3271, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 63 FR 12605, Mar. 16, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 115.62  Prohibition on participation in Prior Approval program.

    Neither a PSB Surety nor any of its Affiliates is eligible to submit 
applications under subpart B of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 115.63  Allotment of guarantee authority.

    (a) General. SBA allots to each PSB Surety a periodic maximum 
guarantee authority. No SBA guarantee attaches to bonds approved by a 
PSB Surety if the bonds exceed the allotted authority for the period in 
which the bonds are approved. No reliance on future authority is 
permitted. An allotment can be increased only by prior written 
permission of SBA.
    (b) Execution of Bid Bonds. When the PSB Surety Executes a Bid Bond, 
SBA debits the Surety's allotment for an amount equal to the guarantee 
percentage of the estimated penal sum of the Final Bond SBA would 
guarantee if the Contract were awarded. If the Contract is then awarded 
for an amount other than the bid amount, or if the bid is withdrawn or 
the Bid Bond guarantee has expired (see Sec. 115.12(c)), SBA debits or 
credits the Surety's allotment accordingly.
    (c) Execution of Final Bonds. If the PSB Surety Executes a 
guaranteed Final Bond, but not the related Bid Bond, SBA debits the 
Surety's allotment for an amount equal to the guarantee percentage of 
the penal sum of the Final Bond. SBA will debit the allotment for 
increases, and credit the allotment for decreases, in the bond amount.
    (d) Release and non-issuance of Final Bonds. The release of Final 
Bonds upon completion of the Contract does not restore the corresponding 
allotment. If, however, a PSB Surety approves a Final Bond but never 
issues the bond, SBA will credit the Surety's allotment for an amount 
equal to the guarantee percentage of the penal sum of the bond. In that 
event, the Surety must notify SBA as soon as possible, but in no event 
later than 5 business days after the non-issuance has been determined. 
Until the Surety has so notified SBA, it cannot rely on such credit.


<R05>
Sec. 115.64  Timeliness requirement.

    There must be no Execution or approval of a bond by a PSB Surety 
after commencement of work under a Contract unless the Surety obtains 
written approval from the AA/SG. To apply for such approval, the Surety 
must submit a completed ``Surety Bond Guarantee Agreement Addendum'' 
(SBA Form 991), together with the evidence and certifications described 
in Sec. 115.19(f)(1)(ii).


<R05>
Sec. 115.65  General PSB procedures.

    (a) Retention of information. A PSB Surety must comply with all 
applicable SBA regulations and obtain from its applicants all the 
information and certifications required by SBA. The PSB Surety must 
document compliance with SBA regulations and retain such certifications 
in its files, including a contemporaneous record of the date of approval 
and Execution of each bond. See also Sec. 115.19(f). The certifications 
and other information must be made available for inspection by SBA or 
its agents and must be available for submission to SBA in connection 
with the Surety's claims for reimbursement. The PSB Surety must retain 
the certifications and other information for the term of the bond, plus 
such additional time as may be required to settle any claims of the 
Surety for reimbursement from SBA and to attempt salvage or other 
recovery, plus an additional 3 years. If there are any unresolved audit 
findings in relation to a particular bond, the Surety must maintain the 
related certifications and other information until the findings are 
resolved.

[[Page 127]]

    (b) Usual staff and procedures. The approval, Execution and 
administration by a PSB Surety of SBA guaranteed bonds must be handled 
in the same manner and with the same staff as the Surety's activity 
outside the PSB program. The Surety must request job status reports from 
Obligees in accordance with its own procedures.
    (c) Notification to SBA. (1) Approvals. A PSB Surety must notify SBA 
by electronic transmission or monthly bordereau, as agreed between the 
Surety and SBA, of all approved Bid and Final Bonds, and of the Surety's 
approval of increases and decreases in the Contract or bond amount. The 
notice must contain the information specified from time to time in 
agreements between the Surety and SBA. SBA may deny liability with 
respect to Final Bonds for which SBA has not received timely notice.
    (2) Other events requiring notification. The PSB Surety must notify 
SBA within 30 calendar days of the name and address of any Principal 
against whom legal action on the bond has been instituted; whenever an 
Obligee has declared a default; whenever the Surety has established or 
added to a claim reserve; of the recovery of any amounts on the 
guaranteed bond; and of any decision by the Surety to bond any such 
Principal again.


<R05>
Sec. 115.66  Fees.

    The PSB Surety must pay SBA a certain percentage of the Premium it 
charges on Final Bonds. The PSB Surety must also remit to SBA the 
Principal's payment for its guarantee fee, equal to a certain percentage 
of the Contract amount. The fee percentages are determined by SBA and 
are published in Notices in the Federal Register from time to time. Each 
fee is rounded to the nearest dollar. The Surety must remit SBA's 
Premium share and the Principal's guarantee fee with the bordereau 
listing the related Final Bond, as required in the PSB Agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 115.67  Changes in Contract or bond amount.

    (a) Increases. The PSB Surety must process Contract or bond amount 
increases within its allotment in the same manner as initial guaranteed 
bond issuances (see Sec. 115.65(c)(1)). The Surety must present checks 
for additional fees due from the Principal and the Surety on increases 
aggregating 25% of the contract or bond amount or $50,000, and attach 
such payments to the respective monthly bordereau. If the additional 
Principal's fee or Surety's fee is less than $40, such fee is not due 
until all unpaid increases in such fee aggregate at least $40.
    (b) Decreases. If the Contract or bond amount is decreased, SBA will 
refund to the Principal a proportionate amount of the guarantee fee, and 
adjust SBA's Premium share accordingly in the ordinary course of 
business. No refund or adjustment will be made until the amounts to be 
refunded or rebated, respectively, aggregate at least $40.


<R05>
Sec. 115.68  Guarantee percentage.

    SBA reimburses a PSB Surety in an amount not to exceed 70% of the 
Loss incurred and paid. Where the Contract amount, after the Execution 
of the bond, increases beyond the statutory limit of $1,250,000, SBA's 
share of the Loss is limited to that percentage of the increased 
Contract amount which the statutory limit represents, multiplied by the 
guarantee percentage approved by SBA. For an example, see 
Sec. 115.31(d).


<R05>
Sec. 115.69  Imminent Breach.

    (a) No prior approval requirement. SBA will reimburse a PSB Surety 
for the guaranteed portion of payments the Surety makes to avoid or 
attempt to avoid an Imminent Breach of the terms of a Contract covered 
by an SBA guaranteed bond. The PSB Surety does not need SBA approval to 
make Imminent Breach payments.
    (b) Amount of reimbursement. The aggregate of the payments by SBA 
under this section cannot exceed 10% of the Contract amount, unless the 
Administrator finds that a greater payment (not to exceed the guaranteed 
portion of the bond penalty) is necessary and reasonable. In no event 
will SBA make any duplicate payment under any provision of these 
regulations in this part.

[[Page 128]]

    (c) Recordkeeping requirement. The PSB Surety must keep records of 
payments made to avoid Imminent Breach.


<R05>
Sec. 115.70  Claims for reimbursement of Losses.

    (a) How claims are submitted. A PSB Surety must submit claims for 
reimbursement on a form approved by SBA no later than 1 year from the 
date the Surety paid the amount. Loss is determined as of the date of 
receipt by SBA of the claim for reimbursement, or as of such later date 
as additional information requested by SBA is received. Subject to the 
offset provisions of part 140, SBA pays its share of Loss within 90 days 
of receipt of the requisite information. Claims for reimbursement and 
any additional information submitted are subject to review and audit by 
SBA.
    (b) Surety responsibilities. The PSB Surety must take all necessary 
steps to mitigate Losses when legal action against a bond has been 
instituted, when the Obligee has declared a default, and when the Surety 
has established a claim reserve. The Surety may dispose of collateral at 
fair market value only. Unless SBA notifies the Surety otherwise, the 
Surety must take charge of all claims or suits arising from a defaulted 
bond, and compromise, settle or defend the suits. The Surety must handle 
and process all claims under the bond and all settlements and recoveries 
in the same manner as it does on non-guaranteed bonds.
    (c) Reservation of SBA's rights. The payment by SBA of a PSB 
Surety's claim does not waive or invalidate any of the terms of the PSB 
Agreement, the regulations in this part 115, or any defense SBA may have 
against the Surety. Within 30 days of receipt of notification that a 
claim or any portion of a claim should not have been paid by SBA, the 
Surety must repay the specified amounts to SBA.


<R05>
Sec. 115.71  Denial of liability.

    In addition to the grounds set forth in Sec. 115.19, SBA may deny 
liability to a PSB Surety if:
    (a) The PSB Surety's guaranteed bond was in an amount which, 
together with all other guaranteed bonds, exceeded the allotment for the 
period during which the bond was approved, and no prior SBA approval had 
been obtained;
    (b) The PSB Surety's loss was incurred under a bond which was not 
listed on the bordereau for the period when it was approved; or
    (c) The loss incurred by the PSB Surety is not attributable to the 
particular Contract for which an SBA guaranteed bond was approved.

[[Page 129]]

activities of the Small Business Administration to which this Act 
applies. The Act also permits recipients of Federal funds to continue to 
use certain age distinctions and other factors other than age which meet 
the requirements of the Act and these regulations in the conduct of 
programs and the provision of services to the public.


<R05>
Sec. 117.2  Application of this part.

not listed in appendix A.
    (b) For the purposes of this part, the prohibition against age 
discrimination applies to natural persons of all ages.

<R05>
Sec. 117.4  Discrimination prohibited and exceptions.

    (a) General. To the extent that this part applies, no person in the 
United States shall, on the basis of age, be excluded from participation 
in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under 
any business or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.
    (b) Specific discriminatory actions prohibited. To the extent that 
this part applies, a recipient business or other activity may not, 
directly or through contractual arrangements, on the ground of age:

[[Page 130]]

    (1) Deny an individual any services, financial aid or other benefit 
provided by the business or other activity, except where sanctioned by 
one of the exceptions stated in Sec. 117.4 (d), (e) or (f) of this 
section.
    (2) Provide any service, financial aid or other benefit, except as 
sanctioned by one of the exceptions stated below, in such a way as to 
deny or limit persons in their efforts to participate in federally-
assisted programs;
    (3) Treat an individual differently from others, except as 
sanctioned by an exception stated below, in determining whether the 
person satisfied any admission, enrollment, eligibility, membership, or 
other requirement or condition which individuals must meet in order to 
be provided any service, financial aid or other benefit provided by the 
business or activity.
    (c) The specific forms of prohibited discrimination in paragraph (b) 
of this section does not limit the generality of the prohibition in 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (d) Exception 1. A recipient is permitted to take an action 
otherwise prohibited by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, if the 
action reasonably takes into account age as a factor necessary to the 
normal operation or the achievement of any statutory objective of a 
business or activity. An action reasonably takes into account age as a 
factor necessary to the normal operation or the achievement of any 
statutory objective of a business or activity, if:
    (1) Age is used as a measure or approximation of one or more other 
characteristics; and
    (2) The other characteristic(s) must be measured or approximated in 
order for the normal operation of the business or activity to continue, 
or to achieve any statutory objective of the business or activity; and
    (3) The other characteristic(s) can be reasonably measured or 
approximated by the use of age; and
    (4) The other characteristic(s) are impractical to measure directly 
on an individual basis.

    Note: All of the above factors must be met in order to exclude a 
business activity from the provisions of this part.

    (e) Exception 2. A recipient is permitted to take an action 
otherwise prohibited by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section which is 
based on a factor other than age, even though that action may have a 
disproportionate effect on persons of different ages. An action may be 
based on a factor other than age if the factor bears a direct and 
substantial relationship to the normal operation of the business or 
activity or to the achievement of a statutory objective.
    (f) Exception 3. A recipient is permitted to take an action 
otherwise prohibited by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section if an age 
distinction is contained in that part of a Federal, State or local 
statute or ordinance adopted by an elected general purpose legislative 
body which provides any benefits or assistance to, establishes criteria 
for participation in, or describes intended beneficiaries or target 
groups in age-related terms.
    (g) The burden of proving that an age distinction or other action 
falls within the exceptions outlined in paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of 
this section on the recipient of Federal financial assistance.


<R05>
Sec. 117.5  Illustrative applications.

    (a) Discrimination in providing financial assistance. Development 
companies and small business investment companies, which apply for or 
receive any financial assistance may not discriminate on the ground of 
age in providing financial assistance to small business concerns. Such 
discrimination prohibited by Sec. 117.4 includes but is not limited to 
the failure or refusal, because of the age of the applicant, or the age 
of the applicant's principal owner or operating official to extend a 
loan or equity financing to any business concern; or, in the case of 
financing which has actually been extended, the failure or refusal 
because of the age of the recipient, or the age of recipient's principal 
owner or operating official to accord the recipient fair treatment and 
the customary courtesies regarding such matters as default, grace 
periods and the like.
    (b) Discrimination in accommodations or services. Small Business 
Concerns and others who or which apply for or receive any financial 
assistance in a program administered by the Small Business 
Administration, such as but

[[Page 131]]

not limited to physicians, dentists, hospitals, schools, libraries, and 
other individuals or organizations may not discriminate in the 
treatment, accommodations or services they provide to their patients, 
students, members, passengers, or members of the public, except when the 
normal operation or statutory objective of the business or activity of 
the intended beneficiary is designated in age-related terms, whether or 
not operated for profit. Action by such business or activity to be 
excluded from compliance with this regulation must fall within the 
exceptions enumerated in Sec. 117.4 (d), (e), and (f) of this part.
    (c) The discrimination prohibited by Sec. 117.5(b) includes, but is 
not limited to the failure or refusal, because of age, to accept a 
patient, student, member, customer, client, or passenger, except when 
the imposition of this prohibition would interfere with the normal 
operation of the business, e.g., pediatricians, nursery schools, 
geriatric clinics.


<R05>
Sec. 117.6  Remedial and affirmative action by recipients.

    (a) Where a recipient is found to have discriminated on the basis of 
age, the recipient shall take any remedial action which the Agency may 
require to overcome the effects of the discrimination. If another 
recipient exercises control over the recipient that has discriminated, 
both recipients may be required to take remedial action.
    (b) Even in the absence of a finding of discrimination, a recipient 
may take affirmative action to overcome the effects of conditions that 
resulted in limited participation in the recipient's business or program 
on the basis of age.
    (c) If a recipient operating a program which serves the elderly or 
children in addition to persons of other ages, provides special benefits 
to the elderly or to children, the provision of those benefits shall be 
presumed to be voluntary affirmative action provided that it does not 
have the effect of excluding otherwise eligible persons from 
participation in the program.


<R05>
Sec. 117.7  Assurances required.

    An application for financial assistance under any program 
administered by the Small Business Administration shall, as a condition 
of its approval and the extension of such assistance, contain or be 
accompanied by an assurance that the recipient will comply with this 
part. SBA shall specify the form of the foregoing assurance for each 
program, and the extent to which like assurances will be required of 
contractors and subcontractors, transferees, successors, and other 
participants in the program.


<R05>
Sec. 117.8  Responsibilities of SBA recipients.

    (a) Each SBA recipient has the primary responsibility to ensure that 
its programs and activities are in compliance with the Act and these 
regulations, and shall take steps to eliminate violations of the Act. A 
recipient also has responsibility to maintain records, provide 
information, and to afford SBA access to its records to the extent SBA 
finds necessary to determine whether the recipient is in compliance with 
the Act and these regulations. (OMB No. 3245 0076)
    (b) Where a recipient passes on Federal financial assistance from 
SBA to subrecipients, the recipient shall provide the subrecipients 
written notice of their obligations under the Act and these regulations.
    (c) Each recipient shall make necessary information about the Act 
and these regulations available to its program beneficiaries in order to 
inform them about the protections against discrimination provided by the 
Act and these regulations.
    (d) Whenever an assessment indicates a violation of the Act and the 
SBA regulations, the recipient shall take corrective action.


<R05>
Sec. 117.9  Compliance information.

    (a) Cooperation and assistance. SBA shall, to the fullest extent 
practicable, seek the cooperation of recipients in obtaining compliance 
with this part and shall provide assistance and guidance to recipients 
to help them comply voluntarily with this part.
    (b) Record Keeping. Each recipient shall keep records in such form, 
and

[[Page 132]]

containing such information which SBA determines may be necessary to 
ascertain whether the recipient has complied or is complying with this 
part (OMB No. 3245 0076). In the case of a small business concern which 
receives financial assistance from a development company or from a small 
business investment company, the small business concern shall also keep 
such records and information as may be necessary to enable SBA to 
determine if the small business concern is complying with this part.
    (c) Each recipient shall provide to SBA, upon request, information 
and reports which SBA determines are necessary to ascertain whether the 
recipient is complying with the Act and these regulations.
    (d) Access to sources of information. Each recipient shall permit 
reasonable access by SBA during normal business hours to such of its 
books, records, accounts, and other sources of information, and its 
facilities as may be pertinent to ascertain compliance with this part. 
Where any information required of an applicant or recipient is in the 
exclusive possession of any other agency, institution or person and that 
agency, institution or person shall fail or refuse to furnish the 
information, the recipient shall so certify and shall set forth what 
efforts it has made to obtain the required information. The recipient 
will be held responsible for submitting the information. Failure to 
submit information or permit access to sources of information required 
by SBA will subject the recipient to enforcement procedure as provided 
in Sec. 117.15 of this part.

(Information collection requirements in paragraph (c) were approved by 
the Office of Management and Budget under control number 3245-0076)


<R05>
Sec. 117.10  Review procedures.

    (a) SBA shall from time to time review the practices of recipients 
to determine whether they are complying with this part. As part of a 
compliance review or complaint investigation, SBA may require a 
recipient employing 15 or more full-time employees to complete a written 
self-evaluation, in a manner specified by the Agency, of any age 
distinction imposed in its program or activity receiving Federal 
financial assistance.
    (b) If a compliance review or pre-award review indicates a violation 
of the Act or these regulations, SBA will attempt to achieve voluntary 
compliance with the Act. If voluntary compliance with the recipient 
cannot be achieved, such recipient will be subject to the enforcement 
procedure contained in Sec. 117.15 of these regulations. A refusal to 
permit an on-site compliance review during normal working hours may 
constitute noncompliance with this part.


<R05>
Sec. 117.11  Complaint procedures.

    (a) Any person who believes that he/she or any specific class of 
individuals is being or has been subjected to discrimination by SBA, a 
recipient, or an applicant for assistance, prohibited by this part may, 
by himself/herself or by a representative, file with SBA a written 
complaint. The complainant has the right to have a representative at all 
stages of the complaint procedure.
    (b) A complaint must be filed not later than 180 days from the date 
of the alleged discrimination, unless the time filing is extended by 
SBA. The Adminstrator, the Director, Office of Equal Employment 
Opportunity and Compliance, and the Chief, Office of Civil Rights 
Compliance, are the only officials who may waive the 180-day time limit 
for filing complaints under this part. SBA will consider the date a 
complaint is filed to be the date upon which the complaint is sufficient 
to be processed.
    (c) Each complaint will be reviewed to ensure that it falls within 
the coverage of the Act and contains all information necessary for 
further processing.
    (d) SBA will attempt to facilitate the filing of complaints wherever 
possible, including taking the following actions:
    (1) Accepting as a sufficient complaint, any written statement which 
identifies the parties involved and the date the complainant first had 
knowledge of the alleged violation, describes generally the action or 
practice complained of, and is signed by the complainant.
    (2) Freely permitting a complainant to add information to the 
complaint to

[[Page 133]]

meet the requirements of a sufficient complaint.
    (3) Notifying the complainant and the recipient of their rights and 
obligations under the complaint procedure, including the right to have a 
representative at all stages of the complaint procedure.
    (4) Notifying the complainant and the recipient (or their 
representatives) of their right to contact the Chief, Office of Civil 
Rights Compliance, for information and assistance regarding the 
complaint resolution process.
    (e) SBA will return to the complainant any complaint filed under the 
jurisdiction of this regulation, but found to be outside the 
jurisdiction of this regulation, and will state the reason(s) why it is 
outside the jurisdiction of this regulation.


<R05>
Sec. 117.12  Mediation.

    (a) SBA shall, after ensuring that the complaint falls within the 
coverage of this Act and all information necessary for further 
processing is contained therein, unless the age distinction complained 
of is clearly within an exception, promptly refer the complaint to the 
Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS).
    (b) SBA shall, to the extent possible, require the participation of 
the recipient and the complainant in the mediation process in an effort 
to reach a mutually satisfactory settlement of the complaint or make an 
informed judgment that an agreement is not possible. Both parties need 
not meet with the mediator at the same time.
    (c) If the complainant and the recipient reach a mutually 
satisfactory resolution of the complaint during the mediation period, 
the mediator shall prepare a written statement of the agreement and have 
the complainant and recipient sign it.
    (d) A copy of the written mediation agreement will be referred to 
SBA, and no further action will be taken unless it appears that either 
the complainant or the recipient (or other alleged discriminator subject 
to this part) fails to comply with the agreement.
    (e) If at the end of 60 days after the receipt of a complaint by 
SBA, or at any time prior thereto, an agreement is reached or the 
mediator determines an agreement cannot be reached through mediation, 
the agreement or complaint will be returned to SBA.
    (f) This 60-day period may be extended by the mediator, with the 
concurrence of SBA for not more than 30 days if the mediator determines 
that an agreement will likely be reached during the extended period.
    (g) The mediator shall protect the confidentiality of all 
information obtained in the course of the mediation process. No mediator 
shall testify in any adjudicative proceeding, produce any document, or 
otherwise disclose any information obtained during the course of the 
mediation process without prior approval of the head of the agency 
appointing the mediator.


<R05>
Sec. 117.13  Investigation and resolution of matters.

    (a) SBA will make a prompt investigation whenever a compliance 
review indicates a possible failure to comply with this part by the 
recipient and additional information is needed by SBA to assure 
compliance with this part, or when an unresolved complaint has been 
returned by the FMCS, or when it appears that the complainant or the 
recipient is failing to comply with a mediation agreement. The 
investigation shall include a review of the pertinent practices and 
policies of the recipient, the circumstances under which the possible 
noncompliance with this part occurred, and other factors relevant to a 
determination as to whether the recipient is complying, is not 
complying, or has failed to comply with this part.
    (b) Resolution of matters. If an investigation indicates a failure 
to comply with this part, SBA will so inform the complainant, if 
applicable, and the recipient that the matter will be resolved by 
informal means that are mutually agreeable to the parties, whenever 
possible.
    (1) If, during the course of an investigation, the matter is 
resolved by informal means, SBA will put any agreement in writing and 
have it signed by the parties and an authorized official of SBA.
    (2) If investigation indicates a violation of the Act or these 
regulations, SBA will attempt to achieve voluntary

[[Page 134]]

compliance. If SBA cannot achieve voluntary compliance, it will begin 
enforcement as described in Sec. 117.15.
    (3) If an investigation does not warrant action, SBA will so inform 
the complainant, if applicable, and the recipient in writing.


<R05>
Sec. 117.14  Intimidating or retaliatory acts prohibited.

    No complainant, recipient or other person shall intimidate, 
threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual for the purpose 
of interfering with any right or privilege secured by this part or 
because an individual or group has made a complaint, testified, 
assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, review, 
enforcement process, or hearing under this part. The identity of 
complainants shall be kept confidential except to the extent necessary 
to carry out the purposes of this part, including the conduct of any 
investigation, hearing, mediation, or judicial proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 117.15  Procedure for effecting compliance.

    (a) General. (1) If there appears to be a failure or threatened 
failure to comply with this part by an applicant or recipient and if the 
noncompliance or threatened noncompliance cannot be resolved by informal 
means, compliance with this part may be effected by suspending, 
terminating, or refusing any financial assistance approved but not yet 
disbursed to an applicant. In the case of loans partially or fully 
disbursed, compliance with this part may be effected by calling, 
canceling, terminating, accelerating repayment, or suspending in whole 
or in part the Federal financial assistance provided. The determination 
of the recipient's violation may be made only after a recipient has had 
an opportunity for a hearing on the record before an administrative law 
judge.
    (2) In addition, compliance may be effected by any other means 
authorized by law. Such other means may include, but are not limited to:
    (i) Action by SBA to accelerate the maturity of the recipient's 
obligation;
    (ii) Referral to the Department of Justice with a recommendation 
that appropriate proceedings be brought to enforce any rights of the 
United States under any law of the United States or obligations of the 
recipient created by the Act or this part; and
    (iii) Use of any requirement of or referral to any Federal, State or 
local government agency that will have the effect of correcting a 
violation of the Act or these regulations.
    (3) If there appears to be a failure or threatened failure to comply 
with this part by an SBA program office or official, the Chief, Office 
of Civil Rights Compliance, through the Director, Office of Equal 
Employment Opportunity and Compliance, will recommend appropriate 
corrective action to the Administrator. Any resulting adverse action 
against an SBA employee shall follow Office of Personnel Management and 
SBA procedures for such action.
    (b) Noncompliance with Secs. 117.7 and 117.9. If an applicant fails 
or refuses to furnish an assurance required under 
&<greek-s><greek-e><greek-ps><greek-t><gr-thn-eq> 117.7, or fails to 
provide information or allow SBA access to information under 
&<greek-s><greek-e><greek-ps><greek-t><gr-thn-eq> 117.9 or otherwise 
fails or refuses to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to 
those sections, Federal financial assistance may be deferred for a 
period not to exceed 60 days after the applicant has received a notice 
for an opportunity for hearing under 
&<greek-s><greek-e><greek-ps><greek-t><gr-thn-eq> 117.16, or unless a 
hearing has begun within that time, or the time for beginning the 
hearing has been extended by mutual consent of the recipient and the 
Agency, for purposes of determining what constitutes mutual consent, the 
Agency shall be deemed to have consented to any extension requested by 
the recipient and granted by the administrative law judge (hearing 
officer), whether or not the Agency initially approved the extension. A 
deferral may not continue for more than 30 days after the close of the 
hearing, unless the hearing results in a finding against the applicant 
or recipient.
    (c) SBA will not take action toward accelerating repayment, 
suspending, terminating, or refusing financial assistance until:
    (1) SBA has advised the applicant or recipient of the failure to 
comply and has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary 
means;

[[Page 135]]

    (2) There has been an express finding on the record, after an 
opportunity for hearing, of a failure by the applicant or recipient to 
comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to this part;
    (3) The action has been approved by the Administrator of SBA 
pursuant to &<greek-s><greek-e><greek-ps><greek-t><gr-thn-eq> 117.17; 
and
    (4) The expiration of 30 days after SBA has filed with the committee 
of the House and the committee of the Senate having legislative 
jurisdiction over the form of financial assistance involved, a full 
written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action.
    (d) Other means authorized by law. No action to effect compliance by 
any other means authorized by law shall be taken until:
    (1) SBA has determined that compliance cannot be secured by 
voluntary means;
    (2) The action has been approved by the Administrator or designee;
    (3) The expiration of 30 days after SBA has filed with the committee 
of the House and the committee of the Senate having legislative 
jurisdiction over the form of financial assistance involved, a full 
written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action;
    (4) The applicant or recipient has been notified of the failure to 
comply, and of the action to be taken to effect compliance; and
    (5) The expiration of at least 10 days from the mailing of such 
notice to the applicant or recipient or other person. During this period

<R05>
Sec. 117.16  Hearings.

    (a) Opportunity for hearing. Whenever an opportunity for a hearing 
is required by Sec. 117.15, reasonable notice shall be given by 
registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the affected 
applicant or recipient. This notice shall advise the applicant or 
recipient of the action proposed to be taken, the specific provision 
under which the proposed action against it is to be taken, and the 
matters of fact or law asserted as the basis for this action, and 
either.
    (1) Fix a date not less than 20 days after the date of such notice 
within which the applicant or recipient may request the Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (OHA) that the matter be scheduled for hearing; or
    (2) Advise the applicant or recipient that the matter in question 
has been set down for hearing at a stated place and time. The time and 
place so fixed shall be reasonable and shall be subject to change for 
cause. The complainant shall be advised of the time and place of the 
hearing. An applicant or recipient may waive a hearing and submit 
written information and argument for the record. The failure of an 
applicant or recipient to appear at a hearing for which a date has been 
set shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to a hearing and as 
consent to the making of a decision on the basis of such information as 
is available.
    (b) Time and place of hearing. Hearings shall be held at OHA in 
Washington, DC, at a time fixed by OHA unless that office determines 
that the convenience of the complainant, applicant, recipient or SBA 
requires that another place be selected. Hearings shall be held before 
an administrative law judge designated in accordance with the 
Administrative Procedure Act.
    (c) Right to counsel. In all proceedings under this section, the 
applicant or recipient and SBA shall have the right to be represented by 
counsel.
    (d) Procedures, evidence, and record. (1) The hearings, decisions, 
and any administrative review shall be conducted in conformity with the 
Administrative Procedure Act and 13 CFR part 134. Such rules of 
procedure should be consistent with this section, relate to the conduct 
of the hearing, provide for giving of notices to those referred to in 
paragraph (a) of this section, taking of testimony, exhibits, arguments, 
and briefs, request for findings and other related matters. SBA, the 
complainant, if any, and the applicant or recipient shall be entitled to 
introduce all relevant evidence on the issues as stated in the notice 
for hearing, or as determined by the administrative law judge

[[Page 136]]

conducting the hearing at the outset of or during the hearing.
    (2) Technical rules of evidence may be waived by the administrative 
law judge conducting a hearing pursuant to this part, but rules or 
principles designed to assure production of the most credible evidence 
available, and subject testimony to test by cross-examination shall be 
applied where reasonably necessary. The administrative law judge may 
exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence. All 
documents and other evidence offered or taken for the record shall be 
open to examination by the parties and opportunity shall be given to 
refute facts and arguments advanced on either side of the issues. A 
transcript shall be made of the oral evidence except to the extent the 
substance thereof is stipulated for the record. All decisions shall be 
based upon the hearing record and written findings shall be made.
    (e) Consolidated or joint hearings. In cases in which the same or 
related facts are asserted to constitute noncompliance or threatened 
noncompliance with this part, with respect to two or more forms of 
financial assistance to which this part applies, or noncompliance with 
this part and the regulations of one or more other Federal agencies 
issued under the Act, the Administrator may, by agreement with such 
other agencies, provide for the conduct of consolidated or joint 
hearings, and for the application to such hearings of rules and 
procedures not inconsistent with this part. Final decisions in such 
cases, insofar as this part is concerned, shall be made in accordance 
with Sec. 117.17.


<R05>
Sec. 117.17  Decisions and notices.

    (a) Decision by an administrative law judge. If the hearing is held 
by an administrative law judge, such administrative law judge shall 
either make an initial decision, if so authorized, or certify the entire 
record, including recommended findings and proposed decision, to the 
Administrator for a final decision and a copy of such initial decision 
or certification shall be mailed to the applicant or recipient and the 
complainant. Where the initial decision is made by the administrative 
law judge, the applicant or recipient may, within 30 days of the mailing 
of such notice of initial decision, file with the Administrator 
exceptions to the initial decision, with the reasons therefor. In the 
absence of exceptions, the Administrator may, by motion within 45 days 
after the initial decision, serve on the applicant or recipient a notice 
that he/she will review the decision. Upon the filing of such exceptions 
or of such notice of review, the Administrator shall review the initial 
decision and issue his/her decision thereon, including the reasons 
therefor. The decision of the Administrator shall be mailed promptly to 
the applicant or recipient, and the complainant, if any. In the absence 
of either exceptions or a notice of review, the initial decision shall 
constitute the final decision of the Administrator.
    (b) Decisions on record or review by the Administrator. Whenever a 
record is certified to the Administrator for decision or the 
Administrator reviews the decision of an administrative law judge 
pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, or whenever the Secretary of 
the Department of Health and Human Services or the Department of Justice 
conducts the hearing, the applicant or recipient shall be given 
reasonable opportunity to file briefs or other written statements of its 
contentions and a copy of the final decision of the Administrator shall 
be given in writing to the applicant or recipient and the complainant, 
if any.
    (c) Decisions on record where a hearing is waived. Whenever a 
hearing is waived pursuant to Sec. 117.16, a decision shall be made by 
the Administrator on the record and a copy of such decision shall be 
given in writing to the applicant or recipient, and to the complainant, 
if any.
    (d) Rulings required. Each decision of an administrative law judge 
or the Administrator shall set forth the ruling on each finding, 
conclusion, or exception presented, and shall identify the requirement 
or requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part with which it is 
found that the applicant or recipient has failed to comply.
    (e) Decision by the Administrator. The Administrator shall make any 
final decision which provides for the suspension or termination of, or 
the refusal to

[[Page 137]]

grant or continue Federal financial assistance, acceleration repayment 
or the imposition of any other sanction available under the regulations 
or taken under other means authorized by law.
    (f) Content of orders. The final decision may provide for 
accelerating of repayment, suspension or termination of, or refusal to 
approve, disburse, or continue Federal financial assistance, in whole or 
in part, under the programs involved, and may contain such terms, 
conditions, and other provisions as are consistent with and will 
effectuate the purposes of the Act and this part, including provisions 
designed to assure that no Federal financial assistance will, 
thereafter, be extended under such program to the applicant or recipient 
determined by such decision to have failed to comply with this part, 
unless and until it corrects its noncompliance and satisfies the 
Administrator that it will fully comply with this part.
    (g) Post termination proceedings. (1) An applicant or recipient 
adversely affected by an order issued under paragraph (e) of this 
section shall be restored to full eligibility to receive Federal 
financial assistance only if it satisfies the terms and conditions of 
that order for such eligibility and it brings itself into compliance 
with this regulation and provides reasonable assurance that it will 
fully comply with this regulation.
    (2) Any applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order 
entered pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section may at any time 
request the Administrator to restore fully its eligibility to receive 
Federal financial assistance. Any such request shall be supported by 
information showing that the applicant or recipient has met the 
requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. If the Administrator 
determines that those requirements have been satisfied, he/she shall 
restore such eligibility.
    (3) If the Administrator denies any such request, the applicant or 
recipient may submit a request for a hearing in writing, specifying why 
it believes the denial to have been in error. It shall there upon be 
given an expeditious hearing, with a decision on the record, in 
accordance with rules and procedures issued by the Administrator. The 
applicant or recipient shall be restored to such eligibility if it 
proves at such hearing that it satisfied the requirements of paragraph 
(g)(1) of this section. While proceedings under this paragraph are 
pending, the sanctions imposed by the order issued under paragraph (f) 
of this section shall remain in effect.


<R05>
Sec. 117.18  Judicial review.

    (a) The complainant may file a civil action following the exhaustion 
of administrative remedies under the Act. Administrative remedies are 
exhausted if:
    (1) 180 days have elapsed since the complainant filed the complaint 
and the Agency has made no finding with regard to the complaint; or
    (2) The Agency has issued a finding in favor of the recipient.
    (b) If the Agency fails to make a finding within 180 days or issues 
a finding in favor of the recipient, the Agency shall:
    (1) Advise the complainant of this fact;
    (2) Advise the complainant of the right to file a civil action for 
injunctive relief; and
    (3) Inform the complainant:
    (i) That the complainant may bring a civil action only in a United 
States district court for the district in which the recipient is found 
or transacts business;
    (ii) That a complainant prevailing in a civil action has the right 
to be awarded the costs of the action, including reasonable attorney's 
fees, but that the complainant must demand these costs in the complaint;
    (iii) That before commencing the action the complainant shall give 
30 days notice by registered mail to the Secretary of the Department of 
Health and Human Services, the Attorney General of the United States and 
the recipient;
    (iv) That the notice must state: The alleged violation of the Act; 
the relief requested; the court in which the complainant is bringing the 
action; and whether or not attorney's fees are demanded in the event the 
complainant prevails; and

[[Page 138]]

    (v) That the complainant may not bring an action if the same alleged 
violation of the Act by the same recipient is the subject of a pending 
action in any court of the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 117.19  Effect on other regulations.

    (a) All regulations, orders or like directions heretofore issued by 
SBA which impose requirements designed to prohibit any discrimination 
against individuals on the grounds of age and which authorize the 
suspension or termination of or refusal to grant or to continue 
financial assistance to any applicant for or recipient of such 
assistance for failure to comply with such requirements, are hereby 
superseded to the extent that such discrimination is prohibited by this 
part, except that nothing in this part shall be deemed to relieve any 
person of any obligation assumed or imposed under any such superseded 
regulation, order, instruction, or like direction prior to the effective 
date of this part. Nothing in this part, however, shall be deemed to 
supersede any of the following (including future amendments thereof):
    (1) Executive Order 11246, as amended, and regulations issued 
thereunder;
    (2) Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended;
    (3) The Equal Credit Opportunity Act, as amended and Regulation B of 
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, (12 CFR part 202);
    (4) Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended;
    (5) Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968;
    (6) Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972;
    (7) Section 633(b) of the Small Business Act;
    (8) Part 113 of title 13 of the Code of Federal Regulations (13 CFR 
part 113); or
    (9) Any other statute, order, regulation or instruction, insofar as 
such order, regulations, or instruction prohibits discrimination on the 
grounds of age in any program or situation to which this part is 
inapplicable on any other ground.


<R05>
Sec. 117.20  Supervision and coordination.

    The Administrator may from time to time assign to officials of SBA 
or to officials of other agencies of the Government with the consent of 
such agencies, responsibilities in connection with the effectuation of

final decision as provided in Sec. 117.17), including the achievement of 
effective coordination and maximum uniformity within SBA and within the

          General Descriptions of SBA's Business Loan Programs


<R05>
Sec. 120.1  Which loan programs does this part cover?

    This part regulates SBA's financial assistance to small businesses 
under its general business loan programs (``7(a) loans'') authorized by 
section 7(a) of the Small Business Act (``the Act''), 15 U.S.C. 636(a), 
its microloan demonstration loan program (``Microloans'') authorized by 
section 7(m) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 636(m), and its development company 
program (``504 loans'') authorized by Title V of the Small Business 
Investment Act, 15 U.S.C. 695 to 697f (``Title V''). These three 
programs constitute the business loan programs of the SBA.


<R05>
Sec. 120.2  Descriptions of the business loan programs.

    (a) 7(a) loans. (1) 7(a) loans provide financing for general 
business purposes and may be:
    (i) A direct loan by SBA;
    (ii) An immediate participation loan by a Lender and SBA; or
    (iii) A guaranteed loan (deferred participation) by which SBA 
guarantees a portion of a loan made by a Lender.
    (2) A guaranteed loan is initiated by a Lender agreeing to make an 
SBA guaranteed loan to a small business and applying to SBA for SBA's 
guarantee under a blanket guarantee agreement (participation agreement) 
between SBA and the Lender. If SBA agrees to guarantee (authorizes) a 
portion of the loan, the Lender funds and services the loan. If the 
small business defaults on the loan, SBA's guarantee requires SBA to 
purchase its portion of the outstanding balance, upon demand by the 
Lender and subject to specific conditions. Regulations specific to 7(a) 
loans are found in subpart B of this part.
    (b) Microloans. SBA makes loans and loan guarantees to non-profit 
Intermediaries that make short-term loans up to $25,000 to eligible 
small businesses for general business purposes, except payment of 
personal debts. SBA also makes grants to Intermediaries for use in 
providing management assistance and counseling to small businesses. 
Regulations specific to these loans are found in subpart G of this part.
    (c) 504 loans. Projects involving 504 loans require long-term fixed-
asset financing for small businesses. A Certified Development Company 
(CDC) provides the final portion of this financing with a 504 loan made 
from the proceeds of a Debenture issued by the CDC, guaranteed 100 
percent by SBA (with the full faith and credit of the United States), 
and sold to investors. The regulations specific to these loans are found 
in subpart H of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 120.3  Pilot programs.

    The Administrator of SBA may from time to time suspend, modify, or 
waive rules for a limited period of time to test new programs or ideas. 
The Administrator shall publish a document in the Federal Register 
explaining the reasons for these actions.

                               Definitions


<R05>
Sec. 120.10  Definitions.

    The following terms have the same meaning wherever they are used in 
this part. Defined terms are capitalized wherever they appear.
    Associate. (1) An Associate of a Lender or CDC is:
    (i) An officer, director, key employee, or holder of 20 percent or 
more of the value of the Lender's or CDC's stock or debt instruments, or 
an agent involved in the loan process;
    (ii) Any entity in which one or more individuals referred to in 
paragraphs (1)(i) of this definition or a Close Relative of any such 
individual owns or controls at least 20 percent.

[[Page 144]]

    (2) An Associate of a small business is:
    (i) An officer, director, owner of more than 20 percent of the 
equity, or key employee of the small business;
    (ii) Any entity in which one or more individuals referred to in 
paragraphs (2)(i) of this definition owns or controls at least 20 
percent; and
    (iii) Any individual or entity in control of or controlled by the 
small business (except a Small Business Investment Company (``SBIC'') 
licensed by SBA).
    (3) For purposes of this definition, the time during which an 
Associate relationship exists commences six months before the following 
dates and continues as long as the certification, participation 
agreement, or loan is outstanding:
    (i) For a CDC, the date of certification by SBA;
    (ii) For a Lender, the date of application for a loan guarantee on 
behalf of an applicant; or
    (iii) For a small business, the date of the loan application to SBA, 
the CDC, the Intermediary, or the Lender.
    Authorization is SBA's written agreement providing the terms and 
conditions under which SBA will make or guarantee business loans. It is 
not a contract to make a loan.

    Certified Development Company (``CDC'') is an entity authorized by 
SBA to deliver 504 financing to small businesses.
    Close Relative is a spouse; a parent; or a child or sibling, or the

engage in regular and continuous business activity, which leases real or 
personal property to an Operating Company for use in the Operating 
Company's business, and which complies with the conditions set forth in 
Sec. 120.111.
    Intermediary is the entity in the Microloan program that receives 
SBA financial assistance and makes loans to small businesses in amounts 
up to $25,000.
    Lender is an institution that has executed a participation agreement 
with SBA under the guaranteed loan program.
    Loan Instruments are the Authorization, note, instruments of 
hypothecation, and all other agreements and documents related to a loan.
    Operating Company is an eligible small business actively involved in 
conducting business operations now or about to be located on real 
property owned by an Eligible Passive Company, or using or about to use 
in its business operations personal property owned by an Eligible 
Passive Company.
    Preference is any arrangement giving a Lender or a CDC a preferred 
position compared to SBA relating to the making, servicing, or 
liquidation of a business loan with respect to such things as repayment, 
collateral, guarantees, control, maintenance of a compensating balance, 
purchase of a Certificate of deposit or acceptance of a separate or 
companion loan, without SBA's consent.
    Rural Area is a political subdivision or unincorporated area in a 
non-metropolitan county (as defined by the Department of Agriculture), 
or, if in a metropolitan county, any such subdivision or area with a 
resident population under 20,000 which is designated by SBA as rural.
    Service Provider is an entity that contracts with a Lender or CDC to 
perform management, marketing, legal or other services.


<R04>
           Subpart A--Policies Applying to All Business Loans

                        Eligibility Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 120.100  What are the basic eligibility requirements for all applicants for SBA business loans?

    To be eligible for an SBA business loan, a small business applicant 
must:
    (a) Be an operating business (except for loans to Eligible Passive 
Companies);
    (b) Be organized for profit;
    (c) Be located in the United States;
    (d) Be small under the size requirements of part 121 of this chapter 
(including affiliates). See subpart H of this part for the size 
standards of part 121 of this chapter which apply only to 504 loans; and

[[Page 145]]

    (e) Be able to demonstrate a need for the desired credit.


<R05>
Sec. 120.101  Credit not available elsewhere.

    SBA provides business loan assistance only to applicants for whom 
the desired credit is not otherwise available on reasonable terms from 
non-Federal sources. SBA requires the Lender or CDC to certify or 
otherwise show that the desired credit is unavailable to the applicant 
on reasonable terms and conditions from non-Federal sources without SBA 
assistance, taking into consideration the prevailing rates and terms in 
the community in or near where the applicant conducts business, for 
similar purposes and periods of time. Submission of an application to 
SBA by a Lender or CDC constitutes certification by the Lender or CDC 
that it has examined the availability of credit to the applicant, has 
based its certification upon that examination, and has substantiation in 
its file to support the certification.


<R05>
Sec. 120.102  Funds not available from alternative sources, including personal resources of principals.

    (a) An applicant for a business loan must show that the desired 
funds are not available from the personal resources of any owner of 20 
percent or more of the equity of the applicant. SBA will require the use 
of personal resources from any such owner as an injection to reduce the 
SBA funded portion of the total financing package (i.e., any SBA loans 
and any other financing, including loans from any other source) when 
that owner's liquid assets exceed the amounts specified in paragraphs 
(a) (1) through (3) of this section. When the total financing package:
    (1) Is $250,000 or less, each 20 percent owner of the applicant must 
inject any personal liquid assets which are in excess of two times the 
total financing package or $100,000, whichever is greater;
    (2) Is between $250,001 and $500,000, each 20 percent owner of the 
applicant must inject any personal liquid assets which are in excess of 
one and one-half times the total financing package or $500,000, 
whichever is greater;
    (3) Exceeds $500,000, each 20 percent owner of the applicant must 
inject any personal liquid assets which are in excess of one times the 
total financing package or $750,000, whichever is greater.
    (b) Any liquid assets in excess of the applicable amount set forth 
in paragraph (a) of this section must be used to reduce the SBA portion 
of the total financing package. These funds must be injected prior to 
the disbursement of the proceeds of any SBA financing.
    (c) For purposes of this section, liquid assets means cash or cash 
equivalent, including savings accounts, CDs, stocks, bonds, or other 
similar assets. Equity in real estate holdings and other fixed assets 
are not to be considered liquid assets.


<R05>
Sec. 120.103  Are farm enterprises eligible?

    Federal financial assistance to agricultural enterprises is 
generally made by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), 
but may be made by SBA under the terms of a Memorandum of Understanding 
between SBA and USDA. Farm-related businesses which are not agricultural 
enterprises are eligible businesses under SBA's business loan programs.


<R05>
Sec. 120.104  Are businesses financed by SBICs eligible?

    SBA may make or guarantee loans to a business financed by an SBIC if 
SBA's collateral position will be superior to that of the SBIC. SBA may 
also make or guarantee a loan to an otherwise eligible small business 
which temporarily is owned or controlled by an SBIC under the 
regulations in part 107 of this chapter. SBA neither guarantees SBIC 
loans nor makes loans jointly with SBICs.


<R05>
Sec. 120.105  Special consideration for veterans.

    SBA will give special consideration to a small business owned by a 
veteran or, if the veteran chooses not to apply, to a business owned or 
controlled by one of the veteran's dependents. If the veteran is 
deceased or permanently disabled, SBA will give special consideration to 
one survivor or dependent. SBA will process the application of a

[[Page 146]]

business owned or controlled by a veteran or dependent promptly, resolve 
close questions in the applicant's favor, and pay particular attention 
to maximum loan maturity. For SBA loans, a veteran is a person honorably 
discharged from active military service.

          Ineligible Businesses and Eligible Passive Companies


<R05>
Sec. 120.110  What businesses are ineligible for SBA business loans?

    The following types of businesses are ineligible:
    (a) Non-profit businesses (for-profit subsidiaries are eligible);

lending, such as banks, finance companies, and factors (pawn shops, 
although engaged in lending, may qualify in some circumstances);
    (c) Passive businesses owned by developers and landlords that do not 
actively use or occupy the assets acquired or improved with the loan 
proceeds (except Eligible Passive Companies under Sec. 120.111);

    (e) Businesses located in a foreign country (businesses in the U.S.

counseling or indoctrinating religion or religious beliefs, whether in a 
religious or secular setting;
    (l) Consumer and marketing cooperatives (producer cooperatives are 
eligible);
    (m) Loan packagers earning more than one third of their gross annual 
revenue from packaging SBA loans;
    (n) Businesses with an Associate who is incarcerated, on probation, 
on parole, or has been indicted for a felony or a crime of moral 
turpitude;
    (o) Businesses in which the Lender or CDC, or any of its Associates 
owns an equity interest;
    (p) Businesses which:
    (1) Present live performances of a prurient sexual nature; or
    (2) Derive directly or indirectly more than de minimis gross revenue 
through the sale of products or services, or the presentation of any 
depictions or displays, of a prurient sexual nature;
    (q) Unless waived by SBA for good cause, businesses that have 
previously defaulted on a Federal loan or Federally assisted financing, 
resulting in the Federal government or any of its agencies or 
Departments sustaining a loss in any of its programs, and businesses 
owned or controlled by an applicant or any of its Associates which 
previously owned, operated, or controlled a business which defaulted on 
a Federal loan (or guaranteed a loan which was defaulted) and caused the 
Federal government or any of its agencies or Departments to sustain a 
loss in any of its programs. For purposes of this section, a compromise 
agreement shall also be considered a loss;
    (r) Businesses primarily engaged in political or lobbying 
activities; and
    (s) Speculative businesses (such as oil wildcatting).


<R05>
Sec. 120.111  What conditions must an Eligible Passive Company satisfy?

    An Eligible Passive Company must use loan proceeds to acquire or 
lease, and/or improve or renovate real or personal property (including 
eligible refinancing) that it leases to an Operating Company for the 
conduct of the Operating Company's business. Any ownership structure or 
legal form may qualify as an Eligible Passive Company.
    (a) Conditions that apply to all legal forms:
    (1) The Operating Company must be an eligible small business, and 
the proposed use of the proceeds must be an eligible use if the 
Operating Company were obtaining the financing directly;
    (2) The Eligible Passive Company (with the exception of a trust) and 
the Operating Company each must be small under the appropriate size 
standards in part 121 of this chapter;
    (3) The lease between the Eligible Passive Company and the Operating

[[Page 147]]

Company must be in writing and must be subordinated to SBA's mortgage, 
trust deed lien, or security interest on the property. Also, the 
Eligible Passive Company (as landlord) must furnish as collateral for 
the loan an assignment of all rents paid under the lease;
    (4) The lease between the Eligible Passive Company and the Operating 
Company, including options to renew exercisable solely by the Operating 
Company, must have a remaining term at least equal to the term of the 
loan;
    (5) The Operating Company must be a guarantor or a co-borrower (with 
the Eligible Passive Company) of the loan (in a 7(a) loan including 
working capital, the Operating Company must be a co-borrower); and
    (6) Each holder of an ownership interest constituting at least 20 
percent of the Eligible Passive Company and the Operating Company must 
guarantee the loan (the trustee shall execute the guarantee on behalf of 
any trust).
    (b) Additional conditions that apply to trusts. The eligibility 
status of the trustor will determine trust eligibility. All donors to 
the trust will be deemed to have trustor status for eligibility 
purposes. A trust qualifying as an Eligible Passive Company may engage 
in other activities as authorized by its trust agreement. The trustee 
must warrant and certify that the trust will not be revoked or 
substantially amended for the term of the loan without the consent of 
SBA. The trustor must guarantee the loan. For purposes of this section, 
the trustee shall certify to SBA that:
    (1) The trustee has authority to act;
    (2) The trust has the authority to borrow funds, pledge trust 
assets, and lease the property to the Operating Company;
    (3) The trustee has provided accurate, pertinent language from the 
trust agreement confirming the above; and
    (4) The trustee has provided and will continue to provide SBA with a 
true and complete list of all trustors and donors.

                            Uses of Proceeds


<R05>
Sec. 120.120  What are eligible uses of proceeds?

    A small business must use an SBA business loan for sound business 
purposes. The uses of proceeds are prescribed in each loan's 
Authorization.
    (a) A Borrower may use loan proceeds from any SBA loan to:
    (1) Acquire land (by purchase or lease);
    (2) Improve a site (e.g., grading, streets, parking lots, 
landscaping), including up to 5 percent for community improvements such 
as curbs and sidewalks;
    (3) Purchase one or more existing buildings;
    (4) Convert, expand or renovate one or more existing buildings;
    (5) Construct one or more new buildings; and/or
    (6) Acquire (by purchase or lease) and install fixed assets (for a 
504 loan, these assets must have a useful life of at least 10 years and 
be at a fixed location, although short-term financing for equipment, 
furniture, and furnishings may be permitted where essential to and a 
minor portion of the 504 Project).
    (b) A Borrower may also use 7(a) and microloan proceeds for:
    (1) Inventory;
    (2) Supplies;
    (3) Raw materials; and

an Eligible Passive Company, part of the loan proceeds may be applied 
for working capital if used for that purpose only by the Operating 
Company).
    (c) A Borrower may use 7(a) loan proceeds for refinancing certain 
outstanding debts.


<R05>
Sec. 120.130  Restrictions on uses of proceeds.

    SBA will not authorize nor may a Borrower use loan proceeds for the 
following purposes (including the replacement of funds used for any such 
purpose):
    (a) Payments, distributions or loans to Associates of the applicant 
(except for ordinary compensation for services rendered);

[[Page 148]]

    (b) Refinancing a debt owed to a Small Business Investment Company 
(``SBIC'');
    (c) Floor plan financing or other revolving line credit, except 
under Sec. 120.390;
    (d) Investments in real or personal property acquired and held 
primarily for sale, lease, or investment (except for a loan to an 
Eligible Passive Company or to a small contractor under Sec. 120.310);
    (e) A purpose which does not benefit the small business; or
    (f) Any use restricted by Secs. 120.201 through 120.203 and 120.884 
(specific to 7(a) loans and 504 loans respectively).


<R05>
Sec. 120.131  Leasing part of new construction or existing building to another business.

    (a) If the SBA business loan involves the construction of a new 
building, a Borrower may lease up to 33% of the square footage of 
rentable property (total square footage of all buildings or facilities 
used for business operations) for a short term to any third party if 
reasonable growth projections show that the Borrower will need 
additional space within three years and will use all of the additional 
space within ten years. If the Borrower is an Eligible Passive Company 
leasing 100 percent of the Project space to an Operating Company, the 
Operating Company may sublease up to 33 percent to a third party under 
the same conditions.
    (b) If the SBA business loan involves the acquisition, renovation, 
or reconstruction of an existing building, the Borrower (or Operating 
Company, if the Borrower is an Eligible Passive Company) must occupy at 
least 51 percent of the Rentable Property. The balance of the Rentable 
Property may be leased out to any third party, if the loan proceeds were 
not used to remodel or convert the space to be leased out. (For 504 
loans, see also Sec. 120.871.)

                          Ethical Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 120.140  What ethical requirements apply to participants?

    Lenders, Intermediaries, CDCs, and Associate Development Companies 
(``ADCs'') (in this section, collectively referred to as 
``Participants''), must act ethically and exhibit good character. 
Ethical indiscretion of an Associate of a Participant or a member of a 
CDC will be attributed to the Participant. A Participant must promptly 
notify SBA if it obtains information concerning the unethical behavior 
of an Associate. The following are examples of such unethical behavior. 
A Participant may not:
    (a) Self-deal;
    (b) Have a real or apparent conflict of interest with a small 
business with which it is dealing (including any of its Associates or an 
Associate's Close Relatives) or SBA;
    (c) Own an equity interest in a business that has received or is 
applying to receive SBA financing (during the term of the loan or within 
6 months prior to the loan application);
    (d) Be incarcerated, on parole, or on probation;
    (e) Knowingly misrepresent or make a false statement to SBA;
    (f) Engage in conduct reflecting a lack of business integrity or 
honesty;
    (g) Be a convicted felon, or have an adverse final civil judgment 
(in a case involving fraud, breach of trust, or other conduct) that 
would cause the public to question the Participant's business integrity, 
taking into consideration such factors as the magnitude, repetition, 
harm caused, and remoteness in time of the activity or activities in 
question;
    (h) Accept funding from any source that restricts, prioritizes, or 
conditions the types of small businesses that the Participant may assist 
under an SBA program or that imposes any conditions or requirements upon 
recipients of SBA assistance inconsistent with SBA's loan programs or 
regulations;
    (i) Fail to disclose to SBA all relationships between the small 
business and its Associates (including Close Relatives of Associates), 
the Participant, and/or the lenders financing the Project of which it is 
aware or should be aware;
    (j) Fail to disclose to SBA whether the loan will:
    (1) Reduce the exposure of a Participant or an Associate of a 
Participant in a position to sustain a loss;
    (2) Directly or indirectly finance the purchase of real estate, 
personal property or services (including insurance)

[[Page 149]]

from the Participant or an Associate of the Participant;
    (3) Repay or refinance a debt due a Participant or an Associate of a 
Participant; or
    (4) Require the small business, or an Associate (including Close 
Relatives of Associates), to invest in the Participant (except for 
institutions which require an investment from all members as a condition 
of membership, such as a Production Credit Association);
    (k) Issue a real estate forward commitment to a builder or 
developer; or
    (l) Engage in any activity which taints its objective judgment in 
evaluating the loan.

                      Credit Criteria for SBA Loans


<R05>
Sec. 120.150  What are SBA's lending criteria?

    The applicant (including an Operating Company) must be creditworthy. 
Loans must be so sound as to reasonably assure repayment. SBA will 
consider:
    (a) Character, reputation, and credit history of the applicant (and 
the Operating Company, if applicable), its Associates, and guarantors;
    (b) Experience and depth of management;
    (c) Strength of the business;
    (d) Past earnings, projected cash flow, and future prospects;
    (e) Ability to repay the loan with earnings from the business;
    (f) Sufficient invested equity to operate on a sound financial 
basis;
    (g) Potential for long-term success;
    (h) Nature and value of collateral (although inadequate collateral 
will not be the sole reason for denial of a loan request); and
    (i) The effect any affiliates (as defined in part 121 of this 
chapter) may have on the ultimate repayment ability of the applicant.


<R05>
Sec. 120.151  What is the statutory limit for total loans to a Borrower?

    The aggregate amount of the SBA portions of all loans to a single 
Borrower, including the Borrower's affiliates as defined in part 121 of 
this chapter, may not exceed a guarantee amount of $750,000, except as 
otherwise authorized by statute for a specific loan program. The amount 
of any loan received by an Eligible Passive Company applies to the loan 
limit of both the Eligible Passive Company and the Operating Company.


<R05>
Sec. 120.160  Loan conditions.

    The following requirements are normally required by SBA for all 
business loans:
    (a) Personal guarantees. Holders of at least a 20 percent ownership 
interest generally must guarantee the loan. SBA, in its discretion, 
consulting with the Participating Lender, may require other appropriate 
individuals to guarantee the loan as well, except SBA will not require 
personal guarantees from those owning less than 5% ownership.
    (b) Appraisals. SBA may require professional appraisals of the 
applicant's and principals' assets, a survey, or a feasibility study.
    (c) Hazard Insurance. SBA requires hazard insurance on all 
collateral.
    (d) Taxes. The applicant may not use any of the proceeds to pay 
past-due Federal and state payroll taxes.

            Requirements Imposed Under Other Laws and Orders


<R05>
Sec. 120.170  Flood insurance.

    Under the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 (Sec. 205(b) of Pub. 
L. 93-234; 87 Stat. 983 (42 U.S.C. 4000 et seq.)), a loan recipient must 
obtain flood insurance if any building (including mobile homes), 
machinery, or equipment acquired, installed, improved, constructed, or 
renovated with the proceeds of SBA financial assistance is located in a 
special flood hazard area. The requirement applies also to any inventory 
(business loan program), fixtures or furnishings contained or to be 
contained in the building. Mobile homes on a foundation are buildings. 
SBA, Lenders, CDCs, and Intermediaries must notify Borrowers that flood 
insurance must be maintained.


<R05>
Sec. 120.171  Compliance with child support obligations.

    Any holder of 50% or more of the ownership interest in the recipient 
of an SBA loan must certify that he or she is not more than 60 days 
delinquent on any obligation to pay child support arising under:

[[Page 150]]

    (a) An administrative order;
    (b) A court order;
    (c) A repayment agreement between the holder and a custodial parent; 
or
    (d) A repayment agreement between the holder and a State agency 
providing child support enforcement services.


<R05>
Sec. 120.172  Flood-plain and wetlands management.

    (a) All loans must conform to requirements of Executive Orders 
11988, ``Flood Plain Management'' (3 CFR, 1977 Comp., p. 117) and 11990, 
``Protection of Wetlands'' (3 CFR, 1977 Comp., p. 121). Lenders, 
Intermediaries, CDCs, and SBA must comply with requirements applicable 
to them. Applicants must show:
    (1) Whether the location for which financial assistance is proposed 
is in a floodplain or wetland;
    (2) If it is in a floodplain, that the assistance is in compliance 
with local land use plans; and
    (3) That any necessary construction or use permits will be issued.
    (b) Generally, there is an 8-step decision making process with 
respect to:
    (1) Construction or acquisition of anything, other than a building;
    (2) Repair and restoration equal to more than 50% of the market 
value of a building; or
    (3) Replacement of destroyed structures.
    (c) SBA may determine for the following types of actions, on a case-
by-case basis, that the full 8-step process is not warranted and that 
only the first step (determining if a proposed action is in the base 
floodplain) need be completed:
    (1) Actions located outside the base floodplain;
    (2) Repairs, other than to buildings, that are less than 50% of the 
market value;
    (3) Replacement of building contents, materials, and equipment;
    (4) Hazard mitigation measures;
    (5) Working capital loans; or
    (6) SBA loan assistance of $1,500,000 or less.


<R05>
Sec. 120.173  Lead-based paint.

surface, or on any exterior surface that is readily accessible to 
children under the age of seven years.


<R05>
Sec. 120.174  Earthquake hazards.

    When loan proceeds are used to construct a new building or an 
addition to an existing building, the construction must conform with the 
``National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (``NEHRP'') Recommended 
Provisions for the Development of Seismic Regulations for New 
Buildings'' (which can be obtained from the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency, Publications Office, Washington, DC) or a code identified by SBA 
as being substantially equivalent.


<R05>
Sec. 120.175  Coastal barrier islands.

    SBA and Intermediaries may not make or guarantee any loan within the 
Coastal Barrier Resource System.


<R05>
Sec. 120.176  Compliance with other laws.

    All SBA loans are subject to all applicable laws, including (without 
limitation) the civil rights laws (see parts 112, 113, 117 and 136 of 
this chapter), prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of race, color, 
national origin, religion, sex, marital status, disability or age. SBA 
requests agreements or evidence to support or document compliance with 
these laws, including reports required by applicable statutes or the 
regulations in this chapter.

                   Enforceability Despite Rule Changes


<R05>
Sec. 120.180  Are rules enforceable if they are changed later?

    Regulations and contractual provisions in effect at the time of a 
transaction govern an SBA loan financing transaction, notwithstanding 
subsequent rule or contract changes. SBA may conduct an enforcement 
action regarding any violation of provisions of regulations or contracts 
applicable at the time, but no longer in effect or in use.

[[Page 151]]

                            Loan Applications


<R05>
Sec. 120.190  Where does an applicant apply for a loan?

    An applicant for a business loan should apply to:
    (a) A Lender for a guaranteed or immediate participation loan;
    (b) A CDC for a 504 loan;
    (c) An Intermediary for a Microloan; or
    (d) SBA for a direct loan.


<R05>
Sec. 120.191  The contents of a business loan application.

    For most business loans, SBA requires that an application for a 
business loan contain, among other things, a description of the history 
and nature of the business, the amount and purpose of the loan, the 
collateral offered for the loan, current financial statements, 
historical financial statements (or tax returns if appropriate) for the 
past three years, IRS tax verification, and a business plan, when 
applicable. Personal histories and financial statements will be required 
from principals of the applicant (and the Operating Company, if 
applicable).


<R05>
Sec. 120.192  Approval or denial.

    Applicants receive notice of approval or denial by the Lender, CDC, 
Intermediary, or SBA, as appropriate. Notice of denial will include the 
reasons. If a loan is approved, an Authorization will be issued.


<R05>
Sec. 120.193  Reconsideration after denial.

    An applicant or recipient of a business loan may request 
reconsideration of a denied loan or loan modification request within 6 
months of denial. Applicants denied due to a size determination can 
appeal that determination under part 121 of this chapter. All others 
must be submitted to the office that denied the original request. To 
prevail, the applicant must demonstrate that it has overcome all 
legitimate reasons for denial. Six months after denial, a new 
application is required. If the reconsideration is denied, a second and 
final reconsideration may be considered by the Associate Administrator 
for Financial Assistance (AA/FA), whose decision is final.

                         Computerized SBA Forms


<R05>
Sec. 120.194  Use of computer forms.

    Any Applicant or Participant may use computer generated SBA

applicant obtain the loan, describing the services performed, and 
disclosing the amount of each fee paid or to be paid by the applicant to 
the Agent in conjunction with the performance of those services.

potential loss from an existing debt.


<R05>
Sec. 120.202  Restrictions on loans for changes in ownership.

    A Borrower may not use 7(a) loan proceeds to purchase a portion of a

owners may use loan proceeds to purchase the entire interest of another 
current owner, or a Borrower can purchase ownership of an entire 
business.

[[Page 152]]

         Maturities; Interest Rates; Loan and Guarantee Amounts


<R05>
Sec. 120.210  What percentage of a loan may SBA guarantee?

    SBA's guarantee percentage must not exceed the applicable percentage 
established in section 7(a) of the Act. The maximum allowable guarantee 
percentage on a loan will be determined by the loan amount. As of 
October 12, 1995, the percentages are: Loans of $100,000 or less may 
receive a maximum guarantee of 80 percent. All other loans may receive a 
maximum guarantee of 75 percent, not to exceed $750,000, unless 
otherwise authorized by SBA.


<R05>
Sec. 120.211  What limits are there on the amounts of direct loans?

    (a) The statutory limit for direct loans made under the authority of 
section 7(a)(1)-(19) of the Small Business Act is $350,000. SBA has 
established an administrative limit of $150,000 for direct loans. The 
AA/FA may authorize acceptance of an application up to the statutory 
limit.
    (b) The statutory limit for direct loans made under the authority of 
section 7(a)(20) is $750,000. SBA has established an administrative 
limit of $150,000. The Associate Administrator for Minority Enterprise 
Development may authorize the acceptance of an application that exceeds 
the administrative limit.
    (c) The statutory limit on SBA's portion of an immediate 
participation loan is $350,000. The administrative limit is the lesser 
of 75 percent of the loan or $150,000. The AA/FA may authorize 
exceptions to the administrative limit up to $350,000.


<R05>
Sec. 120.212  What limits are there on loan maturities?

    The term of a loan shall be:
    (a) The shortest appropriate term, depending upon the Borrower's 
ability to repay;
    (b) Ten years or less, unless it finances or refinances real estate 
or equipment with a useful life exceeding ten years; and
    (c) A maximum of 25 years, including extensions. (A portion of a 
loan used to acquire or improve real property may have a term of 25 
years plus an additional period needed to complete the construction or 
improvements.)


<R05>
Sec. 120.213  What fixed interest rates may a Lender charge?

    (a) Fixed Rates for Guaranteed Loans. A loan may have a reasonable 
fixed interest rate. SBA periodically publishes the maximum allowable 
rate in the Federal Register.
    (b) Direct loans. A statutory formula based on the cost of money to 
the Federal government determines the interest rate on direct loans. SBA 
publishes the rate periodically in the Federal Register.


<R05>
Sec. 120.214  What conditions apply for variable interest rates?

    A Lender may use a variable rate of interest, upon SBA's approval. 
SBA's maximum allowable rates apply only to the initial rate on the date 
SBA received the loan application. SBA shall approve the use of a 
variable interest rate under the following conditions:
    (a) Frequency. The first change may occur on the first calendar day 
of the month following initial disbursement, using the base rate (see 
paragraph (c) of this section) in effect on the first business day of 
the month. After that, changes may occur no more often than monthly.
    (b) Range of fluctuation. The amount of fluctuation shall be equal 
to the movement in the base rate. The difference between the initial 
rate and the ceiling rate may be no greater than the difference between 
the initial rate and the floor rate.
    (c) Base rate. The base rate shall be the prime rate in effect on 
the first business day of the month, printed in a national financial 
newspaper published each business day, or the SBA Optional Peg Rate 
which SBA publishes quarterly in the Federal Register.
    (d) Maturities under 7 years. For loans with maturities under seven 
years, the maximum interest rate shall not exceed two and one-quarter (2 
1/4 ) percentage points over the base rate.
    (e) Maturities of 7 years or more. For loans with maturities of 
seven or more years, the maximum interest rate shall not exceed two and 
three-quarters (2 3/4 ) percentage points over the base rate.

[[Page 153]]

    (f) Amortization. Initial amortization of principal and interest may 
be recomputed and reassessed as interest rates fluctuate, as directed by 
SBA. With prior approval of SBA, the Lender may use certain other 
amortization methods, except that SBA does not allow balloon payments.


<R05>
Sec. 120.215  What interest rates apply to smaller loans?

    For a loan over $25,000 but not exceeding $50,000, the interest rate 
may be one percent more than the maximum interest rate described above. 
For a loan of $25,000 or less, the maximum interest rate described above 
may be increased by two percentage points.

  unacceptable to the Borrower or Lender. (The Lender must request refund in writing within 30 calendar days of
  the approval).


[[Page 155]]

    (b) If the guarantee fee is not paid, SBA may terminate the 
guarantee. The Borrower may use working capital loan proceeds to 
reimburse the Lender for the guarantee fee. Acceptance of the guarantee 
fee by SBA shall not waive any right of SBA arising from the Lender's 
misconduct or violation of any provision of this part, the guarantee 
agreement, the Authorization, or other loan documents.
    (c) The Lender shall also pay SBA an annual service fee equal to 0.5 
percent of the outstanding balance of the guaranteed portion of each 
loan. The service fee cannot be charged to the Borrower. SBA may 
institute a late fee charge for delinquent payments of the annual 
service fee to cover administrative costs associated with collecting 
delinquent fees.

[61 FR 3235, Jan. 31, 1996; 61 FR 11471, Mar. 20, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 120.221  Fees which the Lender may collect from a loan applicant.

    (a) Service and packaging fees. The Lender may charge an applicant 
reasonable fees (customary for similar Lenders in the geographic area 
where the loan is being made) for packaging and other services. The 
Lender must advise the applicant in writing that the applicant is not 
required to obtain or pay for unwanted services. The applicant is 
responsible for deciding whether fees are reasonable. SBA may review 
these fees at any time. Lender must refund any such fee considered 
unreasonable by SBA.
    (b) Extraordinary servicing. Subject to prior written SBA approval, 
if all or part of a loan will have extraordinary servicing needs, the 
Lender may charge the applicant a service fee not to exceed 2 percent 
per year on the outstanding balance of the part requiring special 
servicing.
    (c) Out-of-pocket expenses. The Lender may collect from the 
applicant necessary out-of-pocket expenses such as filing or recording 
fees.
    (d) Late payment fee. The Lender may charge the Borrower a late 
payment fee not to exceed 5 percent of the regular loan payment.
    (e) No prepayment fee. The Lender may not charge a fee for full or 
partial prepayment of a loan.

Associate, or any party designated by either, any fees or charges for 
goods or services, including insurance, as a condition for obtaining an 
SBA guaranteed loan (unless permitted by this part);
    (b) Charge an applicant any commitment, bonus, broker, commission, 
referral or similar fee;
    (c) Charge points or add-on interest;
    (d) Share any premium received from the sale of an SBA guaranteed 
loan in the secondary market with a Service Provider, packager, or other

Agreements.

                         Participation Criteria

For purposes of this paragraph (e), a qualified loan is one which was 
initially approved in the amount of $100,000 or less and is classified

account not controlled by the Lender, its Associate, or the designee. A 
Lender, an Associate, or a designee providing such services must do so

<R05>

written consent. The Lender must be secure financially and have a 
history of compliance with SBA's regulations and any other applicable 
state or Federal statutory and regulatory requirements.
    (b) The Lender, SBA, and any third party involvement in the 
transaction, as determined by SBA in its sole discretion, must enter 
into a written agreement satisfactory to SBA acknowledging SBA's 
interest as guarantor of the subject loans and accepting that all

Guarantee Agreement. In any such agreement, the parties must agree to

hold all pertinent Loan Instruments, and the Lender will continue to 
service the loans after the pledge or transfer is made; and
    (2) The Lender must retain an economic risk in and bear the ultimate 
risk of loss on the unguaranteed portions. This must be demonstrated to 
SBA's satisfaction by establishing a sufficient reserve fund at the time 
of sale of the unguaranteed portions and, in the case of pledging notes, 
by retaining all of the economic interest in the unguaranteed portion of 
any loan which a note evidences.
    (c) The Lender may not use SBA guaranteed loans or the collateral 
supporting such loans as collateral for any borrowing not related to 
financing of the guaranteed or unguaranteed portion of SBA loans.

Lender's inability to meet operational requirements, or a failure to 
engage in prudent lending practices. Proceedings for such purposes will 
be conducted in accordance with the provisions of part 134 of this

final. If SBA grants CLP status, it applies only in the field office 
that processed the CLP designation. A CLP Lender must execute a 
Supplemental Guarantee Agreement that will specify a term not to exceed 
two years.


<R05>
Sec. 120.442  Suspension or revocation of CLP status.

    The AA/FA may suspend or revoke CLP status upon written notice 
providing the reasons at least 10 business days prior to the effective 
date of the suspension or revocation. Reasons for suspension or 
revocation may include a loan performance record unacceptable to SBA, 
failure to make the required number of loans under the expedited 
procedures, or violations of applicable statutes, regulations or 
published SBA policies and procedures. A CLP Lender may appeal the 
suspension or revocation made under this section under procedures found 
in part 134 of this chapter. The action of the AA/FA remains in effect 
pending resolution of the appeal.

                     Preferred Lenders Program (PLP)


<R05>
Sec. 120.450  What is the Preferred Lenders Program?

    Under the Preferred Lenders Program (PLP), designated Lenders 
process, close, service, and liquidate SBA guaranteed loans with reduced 
requirements for documentation to and prior approval by SBA.


<R05>
Sec. 120.451  How does a Lender become a PLP Lender?

    (a) An SBA field office serving the area in which a Lender's office 
is located can nominate the Lender, or a Lender can request a field 
office to consider it for PLP status. The SBA field office will forward 
its recommendation to an SBA centralized loan processing center which 
will submit its recommendation and supporting documentation to the AA/FA 
for final decision.
    (b) In making its decision, SBA considers whether the Lender:
    (1) Has the required ability to process, close, service and 
liquidate loans;
    (2) Has the ability to develop and analyze complete loan packages; 
and
    (3) Has a satisfactory performance history with SBA.
    (c) If the Lender is approved, the AA/FA will designate the area in 
which it can make PLP loans.
    (d) Before it can operate as a PLP Lender, the approved Lender must 
execute a Supplemental Guarantee Agreement, which will specify a term 
not to exceed two years.
    (e) When a PLP's Supplemental Guarantee Agreement expires, SBA may 
recertify it as a PLP Lender for an additional term not to exceed two 
years. Prior to recertification, SBA will review a PLP Lender's loans, 
policies and procedures. The recertification decision of the AA/FA is 
final.
    (f) A PLP Lender may request an expansion of the territory in which 
it can process PLP loans by submitting its request to a loan processing 
center. The center will obtain the recommendation of each SBA office in 
the area into which the PLP Lender would like to expand its PLP 
operations. The center will forward the recommendations to the AA/FA for 
final decision. If a PLP Lender is not a CLP Lender in a territory into 
which it seeks to expand its PLP status, it automatically obtains CLP 
status in that territory when it is granted PLP status for the 
territory.


<R05>
Sec. 120.452  What are the requirements of PLP loan processing?

    (a) Subparts A and B of this part govern the making of PLP loans, 
except for the following:
    (1) Certain types of businesses, loans, and loan programs are not 
eligible for PLP, as detailed in published SBA policy and procedures.
    (2) A Lender may not make a PLP business loan which reduces its 
existing credit exposure for any Borrower,

[[Page 164]]

except in cases where an interim loan(s) has been made for other than 
real estate construction purposes to the Borrower which was approved by 
the Lender within 90 days of receipt of the issuance fo a subsequent PLP 
loan number.
    (3) SBA will not guarantee more than the specified statutory 
percentage of any PLP loan.
    (b) A PLP Lender notifies SBA of its approval of a PLP loan by 
submitting to SBA's loan processing center appropriate documentation 
signed by two of the PLP's authorized representatives. SBA will attach 
the SBA guarantee and notify the PLP Lender of the SBA loan number (if 
it does not identify a problem with eligibility, and funds are 
available).
    (c) The PLP Lender is responsible for all PLP loan decisions 
regarding eligibility (including size) and creditworthiness. The PLP 
Lender is also responsible for confirming that all PLP loan closing 
decisions are correct, and that it has complied with all requirements of 
law and SBA regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 120.453  What are the requirements of a PLP Lender in servicing and liquidating SBA guaranteed loans?

    The PLP Lender must service and liquidate its SBA guaranteed loan 
portfolio (including its non-PLP loans) using generally accepted 
commercial banking standards employed by prudent lenders. The PLP Lender 
must liquidate any defaulted SBA guaranteed loan in its portfolio unless 
SBA advises in writing that SBA will liquidate the loan. The PLP Lender 
must submit a liquidation plan to SBA prior to commencing liquidation 
action. The PLP Lender may take any necessary servicing action, or 
liquidation action consistent with a plan, for any SBA guaranteed loan 
in its portfolio, except it may not:
    (a) Take any action that confers a Preference on the Lender;
    (b) Accept a compromise settlement without prior written SBA 
consent; and
    (c) Sell or pledge more than 90 percent of a PLP loan.


<R05>
Sec. 120.454  PLP performance review.

    SBA may review the performance of a PLP Lender. SBA may charge the 
PLP Lender a fee to cover the costs of this review.


<R05>
Sec. 120.455  Suspension or revocation of PLP status.

    The AA/FA may suspend or revoke PLP status upon written notice 
providing the reasons at least 10 business days prior to the effective 
date of the suspension or revocation. Reasons for suspension or 
revocation may include loan performance unacceptable to SBA, failure to 
make the required number of loans under the expedited procedures, or 
violations of applicable statutes, regulations or published SBA policies 
and procedures. A PLP Lender may appeal the suspension or revocation 
made under this section under procedures found in part 134 of this 
chapter. The action of the AA/FA remains in effect pending resolution of 
the appeal.

                 Small Business Lending Companies (SBLC)


<R05>
Sec. 120.470  What is an SBLC?

    A Small Business Lending Company (SBLC) is a nondepository lending 
institution licensed by SBA. SBA supervises, examines, and regulates 
SBLCs. An SBLC is subject to all applicable SBA regulations, including 
those governing Lenders. SBA has imposed a moritorium on licensing new 
SBLC's since January, 1982.
    (a) An SBLC may only make:
    (1) Loans under section 7(a) (except section 7(a)(13)) of the Act in 
participation with SBA; and/or
    (2) SBA guaranteed loans to micro-Lenders in the SBA Microloan 
program (see subpart G of this part). Such loans are subject to the same 
conditions as guaranteed loans made to SBA-designated microlenders by 
SBA participating Lenders.
    (b) In addition to complying with Secs. 120.400 through 120.413, an 
SBLC must meet the following requirements:
    (1) Business structure. It must be a corporation (profit or non-
profit).
    (2) Written agreement. It must sign a written agreement with SBA.
    (3) Capital structure. It must have unencumbered paid-in capital and 
paid-

[[Page 165]]

in surplus of at least $1,000,000, or ten percent of the aggregate of 
its share of all outstanding loans, whichever is more.
    (4) Capital impairment. It must avoid capital impairment at all 
times. Impairment exists if the retained earnings deficit of an SBLC 
exceeds 50 percent of combined paid-in capital and paid-in-surplus, 
excluding treasury stock. An SBLC must give SBA prompt written notice of 
any capital impairment within 30 calendar days of the month-end 
financial report that first reflects the impairment. Until the 
impairment is cured, an SBLC may not present any loans to SBA for 
guarantee.
    (5) Issuance of securities. Without prior written SBA approval, it 
must not issue any securities (including stock options and debt 
securities) except stock dividends and common stock issued for cash or 
direct obligations of, or obligations fully guaranteed as to principal 
and interest by, the United States.
    (6) Voluntary capital reduction. Without prior written SBA approval, 
it must not voluntarily reduce its capital, or purchase and hold more 
than 2 percent of any class or combination of classes of its stock.
    (7) Reserves for losses. It must maintain a reserve in the amount of 
anticipated losses on loans and receivables.
    (8) Internal control. It must adopt a plan designed to safeguard its 
funds and other assets, to assure the reliability of its personnel, and 
to maintain the accuracy of its financial data.
    (9) Dual control. It must maintain dual control over disbursement of 
funds and withdrawal of securities. An SBLC may disburse funds only by 
checks or wire transfers authorized by signatures of two or more 
officers covered by the SBLC's fidelity bond, except that checks in an 
amount of $1,000 or less may be signed by one bonded officer. There must 
be two or more bonded officers, or one bonded officer and a bonded 
employee to open safe deposit boxes or withdraw securities from 
safekeeping. The SBLC shall furnish to each depository bank, custodian, 
or entity providing safe deposit boxes a certified copy of the 
resolution implementing these control procedures.
    (10) Fidelity insurance. It must maintain a Brokers Blanket Bond, 
Standard Form 14, or Finance Companies Blanket Bond, Standard Form 15, 
or such other form of coverage as SBA may approve, in a minimum amount 
of $500,000 executed by a surety holding a certificate of authority from 
the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 9304-9308.
    (11) Common control. It must not control, be controlled by, or be 
under common control with, another SBLC. Without prior written SBA 
approval, an Associate of one SBLC shall not be an Associate of another 
SBLC or of any entity which directly or indirectly controls or is under 
common control with another SBLC.
    (12) Management. An SBLC must employ full time professional 
management.
    (13) Borrowed funds. Without SBA's prior written approval, it must 
not be capitalized with borrowed funds. Shareholders owning 10 percent 
or more of any class of its stock shall not use borrowed funds to 
purchase the stock unless the net worth of the shareholders is at least 
twice the amount borrowed or unless the shareholders receive SBA's prior 
written approval for a lower ratio.


<R05>
Sec. 120.471  Records.

    Each SBLC must comply with the following requirements concerning 
records:
    (a) Maintenance of Records. It must maintain accurate and current 
financial records, including books of account, minutes of stockholder, 
directors, and executive committee meetings, and all documents and 
supporting materials relating to the SBLC's transactions at its 
principal business office. Securities held by a custodian pursuant to a 
written agreement shall be exempt from this requirement.
    (b) Preservation of records. (1) It must preserve in a manner 
permitting immediate retrieval the following documentation for the 
financial statements required by Sec. 120.472 (and of the accompanying 
certified public accountant's opinion), for the following specified 
periods:
    (i) Preserve permanently:

[[Page 166]]

    (A) All general and subsidiary ledgers (or other records) reflecting 
asset, liability, capital stock and surplus, income, and expense 
accounts;
    (B) All general and special journals (or other records forming the 
basis for entries in such ledgers); and
    (C) The corporate charter, bylaws, application for determination of 
eligibility to participate with SBA, and all minutes books, capital 
stock certificates or stubs, stock ledgers, and stock transfer 
registers;
    (ii) Preserve for at least 6 years following final disposition of 
the related loan:
    (A) All applications for financing;
    (B) Lending, participation, and escrow agreements;
    (C) Financing instruments; and
    (D) All other documents and supporting material relating to such 
loans, including correspondence.
    (2) Records and other documents referred to in this section may be 
preserved electronically if the original is available for retrieval 
within a reasonable period.


<R05>
Sec. 120.472  Reports to SBA.

    An SBLC must submit the following to the AA/FA:
    (a) An audited financial statement prepared by a certified public 
accountant within three months after the close of each fiscal year, and 
interim financial reports when requested by SBA;
    (b) A report of any legal or administrative proceeding, by or 
against the SBLC, or against an officer, director, or employee of the 
SBLC for an alleged breach of official duty, within 10 days after 
initiating or learning of the proceeding, as well as notification of the 
terms of any settlement or final judgment (in addition to any reporting 
under applicable SBA Forms);
    (c) Copies of any report furnished to its stockholders (including 
any prospectus, letter, or other publication concerning the financial 
operations of the SBLC);
    (d) A summary of any changes in the SBLC's organization or 
financing, such as:
    (1) Any change in its name, address or telephone number;
    (2) Any change in its charter, bylaws, or its officers or directors 
(to be accompanied by a statement of personal history on an approved SBA 
form);
    (3) Any changes in capitalization (including those identified in 
Sec. 120.470);
    (4) Any changes affecting the eligibility of the SBLC to continue to 
participate as an SBLC; and
    (5) Notice of a pledge of stock within 30 calendar days of the 
transaction if 10 percent or more of the stock is pledged by any person 
(or group of persons acting in concert) as collateral for indebtedness, 
and such pledge does not involve a transfer for which prior written 
approval of SBA is required under Sec. 120.473;
    (e) Such other reports as SBA may require from time to time by 
written directive.


<R05>
Sec. 120.473  Change of ownership or control.

    (a) Any change of ownership or control without prior written 
approval of SBA is prohibited. An SBLC must request approval of any such 
change from the AA/FA. Pending the approval, the SBLC may not register 
the proposed new owners on its transfer books nor permit them to 
participate in any manner in the conduct of the SBLC's affairs. Change 
of ownership or control includes:
    (1) Any transfer of 10 percent or more of any class of the SBLC's 
stock, and any agreement providing for such transfer;
    (2) Any transfer that could result in the beneficial ownership by 
any person or group of persons acting in concert of 10 percent or more 
of any class of its stock, and any agreement providing for such 
transfer;
    (3) Any merger, consolidation, or reorganization; or
    (4) Any other transaction or agreement that transfers control of the 
SBLC.
    (b) If transfer of ownership or control is subject to the approval 
of any State or Federal chartering, licensing, or other regulatory 
authority, copies of any documents filed with such authority must, at 
the same time, be transmitted to the AA/FA.

[[Page 167]]


<R05>
Sec. 120.474  Prohibited financing.

    An SBLC may not make a loan to a small business that has received 
financing (or a commitment for financing) from an SBIC that is an 
Associate of the SBLC.


<R05>
Sec. 120.475  Audits.

    Every SBLC is subject to periodic audits by SBA's Office of 
Inspector General, Auditing Division, and the cost of such audits will 
be assessed against the SBLC, except for the first audit. Fees are 
structured based on the SBLC's assets as of the date of the latest 
audited financial statement submitted to SBA before the audit. The fee 
schedule is set forth in SBA's Standard Operating Procedures manual.


<R05>
Sec. 120.476  Suspension or revocation.

    SBA may revoke or suspend an SBLC for a violation of law, these 
regulations, or any agreement with SBA. An appeal can be made following 
the procedures set forth in part 134 of this chapter.


<R04>
                     Subpart E--Loan Administration


<R05>
Sec. 120.500  General.

    This subpart outlines the general loan administration policies 
applicable to loan servicing and liquidation.

                                Servicing


<R05>
Sec. 120.510  Servicing direct and immediate participation loans.

    SBA services the direct loans that it makes. Generally, the Lender 
services immediate participation loans that it makes and in which SBA 
participates.


<R05>
Sec. 120.511  Servicing guaranteed loans.

    The Lender services guaranteed loans, holds the Loan Instruments and 
receives the Borrower's payments of principal and interest.


<R05>
Sec. 120.512  Who services the loan after SBA honors its guarantee?

    Generally, after SBA honors its guarantee, the Lender must continue 
to hold the Loan Instruments and service and liquidate the loan. The 
Lender must execute a Certificate of Interest showing SBA's percentage 
of the loan, and must submit a liquidation plan to SBA for each loan to 
be liquidated. If SBA elects to service or liquidate the loan, the 
Lender must assign the Loan Instruments to SBA.


<R05>
Sec. 120.513  What servicing actions require the prior written consent of SBA?

    Except as otherwise provided in a Supplemental Guarantee Agreement 
with the Lender, SBA must give its prior written consent before the 
Lender takes any of the following actions:
    (a) Alters substantially the terms or conditions of any Loan 
Instrument (for example, any increase in the principal amount or change 
in the interest rate, or action conferring a Preference on the Lender);
    (b) Releases collateral having a cumulative value in excess of 20 
percent of the original loan amount;
    (c) Accelerates the maturity of the note;
    (d) Sues upon any Loan Instrument;
    (e) Compromises or waives any claim against any Borrower, guarantor, 
obligor or standby creditor arising out of any Loan Instrument; or
    (f) Increases the amount of any prior lien held by the Lender on the 
collateral securing the loan.

                 SBA'S Purchase of a Guaranteed Portion


<R05>
Sec. 120.520  When does SBA honor its guarantee?

    (a) SBA, in its sole discretion, may purchase a guaranteed portion 
of a loan at any time. A Lender may demand in writing that SBA honor its 
guarantee if the Borrower is in default on any installment for more than 
60 calendar days (or less if SBA agrees) and the default has not been 
cured. If a Borrower cures a default before a Lender requests purchase 
by SBA, the Lender's right to request purchase on that default lapses.
    (b) Purchase by SBA of the guaranteed portion does not waive any of 
SBA's rights to recover money paid on the guarantee, based upon the 
Lender's negligence, misconduct, or violation of this part, including 
those actions listed in Sec. 120.524(a), the Loan Guarantee Agreement or 
the Loan Instruments.

[[Page 168]]


<R05>
Sec. 120.521  What interest rate applies after SBA purchases its guaranteed portion?

    When SBA purchases the guaranteed portion of a fixed interest rate 
loan, the rate of interest remains as stated in the note. On loans with 
a fluctuating interest rate, the interest rate that the Borrower owes 
will be at the rate in effect at the time of the earliest uncured 
payment default, or the rate in effect at the time of purchase (where no 
default has occurred).


<R05>
Sec. 120.522  How much accrued interest does SBA pay to the Lender or Registered Holder when SBA purchases the guaranteed portion?

    (a) Rate of interest. If SBA purchases the guaranteed portion from a 
Lender or from a Registered Holder (if sold in the Secondary Market), it 
will pay accrued interest at:
    (1) The rate in the note if it is a fixed rate loan; or
    (2) The rate in effect on the date of the earliest uncured payment 
default, or of SBA's purchase (if there has been no default).
    (b) Payment to Lender. If the Lender submits a complete purchase 
request to SBA within 120 days of the earliest uncured payment default, 
SBA will pay accrued interest to the Lender from the last interest paid-
to-date up to the date of payment. If the Lender requests SBA to 
purchase after 120 days from the date of the earliest uncured payment 
default date, SBA will pay only 120 days of interest. For LowDoc loans, 
the interest paid to the Lender will be governed by the Supplemental 
Guarantee Agreement.
    (c) Payment to Registered Holder. SBA will pay a Registered Holder 
all accrued interest up to the date of payment.
    (d) Extension of the 120 day period. Before the 120 days expire, the 
SBA field office may extend the period if the Lender and SBA agree that 
the Borrower can cure the default within a reasonable and definite 
period of time or that the benefits from doing so otherwise will exceed 
the costs of SBA paying additional interest. If the 120 days have 
passed, only the AA/FA or designee can extend the period.


<R05>
Sec. 120.523  What is the ``earliest uncured payment default''?

    The earliest uncured payment default is the date of the earliest 
failure by a Borrower to pay a regular installment of principal and/or 
interest when due. Payments made by the Borrower before a Lender makes 
its request to SBA to purchase are applied to the earliest uncured 
payment default. If the installment is paid in full, the earliest 
uncured payment default date will advance to the next unpaid installment 
date. If a Borrower makes any payment after the Lender makes its request 
to SBA to purchase, the earliest uncured payment default date does not 
change because the Lender has already exercised its right to request 
purchase.


<R05>
Sec. 120.524  When is SBA released from liability on its guarantee?

    (a) SBA is released from liability on a loan guarantee (in whole or 
in part, within SBA's exclusive discretion), if any of the events below 
occur:
    (1) The Lender has failed to comply materially with any of the 
provisions of these regulations, the Loan Guarantee Agreement, or the 
Authorization;
    (2) The Lender has failed to make, close, service, or liquidate a 
loan in a prudent manner;
    (3) The Lender's improper action or inaction has placed SBA at risk;
    (4) The Lender has failed to disclose a material fact to SBA 
regarding a guaranteed loan in a timely manner;
    (5) The Lender has misrepresented a material fact to SBA regarding a 
guaranteed loan;
    (6) SBA has received a written request from the Lender to terminate 
the guarantee;
    (7) The Lender has not paid the guarantee fee within the period 
required under SBA rules and regulations;
    (8) The Lender has failed to request that SBA purchase a guarantee 
within 120 days after maturity of the loan;
    (9) The Lender has failed to use required SBA forms or exact 
electronic copies; or
    (10) The Borrower has paid the loan in full.
    (b) If SBA determines, after purchasing its guaranteed portion of a 
loan, that any of the events set forth in paragraph (a) of this section 
occurred

[[Page 169]]

in connection with that loan, SBA is entitled to recover any money paid 
on the guarantee plus interest from the Lender responsible for those 
events.
    (c) If the Lender's loan documentation indicates that one or more of 
the events in paragraph (a) of this section may have occurred, SBA may 
undertake such investigation as it deems necessary to determine whether 
to honor or deny the guarantee, and may withhold a decision on whether 
to honor the guarantee until the completion of such investigation.
    (d) Any information provided to SBA prior to Lender's request for 
SBA to honor its guarantee shall not prejudice SBA's right to deny 
liability for a guarantee if one or more of the events listed in 
paragraph (a) of this section occur.
    (e) Unless SBA provides written notice to the contrary, the Lender 
remains responsible for all loan servicing ad liquidation actions until 
SBA honors its guarantee in full.

          Deferment, Extension of Maturity and Loan Moratorium


<R05>
Sec. 120.530  Deferment of payment.

    SBA may agree to defer payments on a business loan for a stated 
period of time, and use such other methods as it considers necessary and 
appropriate to help in the successful operation of the Borrower. This 
policy applies to all business loan programs, including 504 loans.


<R05>
Sec. 120.531  Extension of maturity.

    SBA may agree to extend the maturity of a loan for up to 10 years 
beyond its original maturity if the extension will aid in the orderly 
repayment of the loan.


<R05>
Sec. 120.532  What is a loan Moratorium?

    SBA may assume a Borrower's obligation to repay principal and 
interest on a loan by agreeing to make the payments to the Lender on 
behalf of the Borrower under terms and conditions set by SBA. This 
relief is called a ``Moratorium.'' Complete information concerning this 
program may be obtained from local SBA offices.

                        Liquidation of Collateral


<R05>
Sec. 120.540  What are SBA's policies concerning liquidation of collateral?

    (a) Liquidation policy. SBA or the Lender may liquidate collateral 
securing a loan if the loan is in default or there is no reasonable 
prospect that the loan can be repaid within a reasonable period.
    (b) Sale and conversion of loans. Without the consent of the 
Borrower, SBA may:
    (1) Sell a direct loan;
    (2) Convert a guaranteed or immediate participation loan to a direct 
loan; or
    (3) Convert an immediate participation loan to a guaranteed loan or 
a loan owned solely by the Lender.
    (c) Disposal of collateral and assets acquired through foreclosure 
or conveyance. SBA or the Lender may sell real and personal property 
(including contracts and claims) pledged to secure a loan that is in 
default in accordance with the provisions of the related security 
instrument (see Sec. 120.550 for Homestead Protection for Farmers).
    (1) Competitive bids or negotiated sales. Generally, SBA will offer 
loan collateral and acquired assets for public sale through competitive 
bids at auctions or sealed bid sales. The Lender may use negotiated 
sales if consistent with its usual practice for similar non-SBA assets.
    (2) Lease of acquired property. Normally, neither SBA nor a Lender 
will rent or lease acquired property or grant options to purchase. SBA 
and the Lender will consider proposals for a lease if it appears a 
property cannot be sold advantageously and the lease may be terminated 
on reasonable notice upon receipt of a favorable purchase offer.
    (d) Recoveries and security interests shared. SBA and the Lender 
will share pro rata (in accordance with their respective interests in a 
loan) all loan payments or recoveries, all reasonable expenses 
(including advances for the care, preservation, and maintenance of 
collateral securing the loan and the payment of senior lienholders), and 
any security interest or guarantee (excluding SBA's guarantee) which the 
Lender

[[Page 170]]

or SBA may hold or receive in connection with a loan.
    (e) Guarantors. Guarantors of financial assistance have no rights of 
contribution against SBA on an SBA guaranteed or direct loan. SBA is not 
deemed to be a co-guarantor with any other guarantors.

                    Homestead Protection for Farmers


<R05>
Sec. 120.550  What is homestead protection for farmers?

    SBA may lease to a farmer-Borrower the farm residence occupied by 
the Borrower and a reasonable amount of adjoining property (no more than 
10 acres and seven farm buildings), if they were acquired by SBA as a 
result of a defaulted farm loan made or guaranteed by SBA (see the 
Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act, 7 U.S.C. 1921, for 
qualifying loan purposes).


<R05>
Sec. 120.551  Who is eligible for homestead protection?

    SBA must notify the Borrower in possession of the availability of 
these homestead protection rights within 30 days after SBA acquires the 
property. A farmer-Borrower must:
    (a) Apply for the homestead occupancy to the SBA field office which 
serviced the loan within 90 days after SBA acquires the property;
    (b) Provide evidence that the farm produces farm income reasonable 
for the area and economic conditions;
    (c) Show that at least 60 percent of the Borrower and spouse's gross 
annual income came from farm or ranch operations in at least any two out 
of the last six calendar years;
    (d) Have resided on the property during the previous six years; and

<R05>
Sec. 120.601  SBA Secondary Market.

    The SBA secondary market (``Secondary Market'') consists of the sale 
of Certificates, representing either the entire guaranteed portion of an 
individual 7(a) guaranteed loan or an undivided interest in a Pool 
consisting of the SBA guaranteed portions of a number of 7(a) guaranteed 
loans. By the terms of such Certificate, SBA guarantees a Registered 
Holder timely payment of principal and interest from the loan or loans 
underlying the Certificate. Transactions involving interests in Pools or 
the sale of individual guaranteed portions of loans are governed by the 
contracts entered into by the parties, SBA's Secondary Market Program 
Guide, and this subpart. See sections 5 (f), (g), and (h) of the Small 
Business Act (15 U.S.C. 634 (f), (g) and (h)).

                              Certificates


<R05>
Sec. 120.610  Form and terms of Certificates.

    (a) General form and content. Each Certificate must be registered 
with the FTA. SBA must approve the terms of the Certificate.
    (b) Face amount of Pool Certificate. The face amount of a Pool 
Certificate cannot be less than a minimum amount as specified in the 
Program Guide, and the dollar amount of Certificates must be in 
increments which SBA will specify in the Program Guide (except for one 
Certificate in each Pool). SBA may change these requirements based upon 
an analysis of market conditions and program experience, and will 
publish any such change in the Federal Register.
    (c) Basis of payment for Pool Certificates. Principal installments 
and interest payments are based on the unpaid principal balance of the 
portion of the Pool represented by a Pool Certificate. All prepayments 
on loans in the Pool must be passed through to the appropriate 
Registered Holders with the regularly scheduled payments to such 
Holders.
    (d) Basis of payment for Individual Certificates. Principal 
installments and interest payments are based on the unpaid principal 
balance of the SBA guaranteed portion of the loan supporting an 
Individual Certificate. The Certificate must provide for a pass through 
to the Registered Holder of payments which the FTA receives from a 
Lender or any entity servicing the loan, less applicable fees.
    (e) Interest rate on Pool Certificate. The interest rate on a Pool 
Certificate must be equal to the lowest Net Rate on any individual 
guaranteed portion of a loan in the Pool.


<R05>
Sec. 120.611  Pools backing Pool Certificates.

    (a) Pool characteristics. As set forth in the Program Guide, each 
Pool must have:
    (1) A minimum number of guaranteed portions of loans;
    (2) A minimum aggregate principal balance of the guaranteed 
portions;
    (3) A maximum percentage of the Pool which an individual guaranteed 
portion may constitute;
    (4) A maximum allowable difference between the highest and lowest 
note interest rates;
    (5) A maximum allowable difference between the remaining terms to 
maturity of the loans in the Pool; and
    (6) A minimum weighted average maturity at Pool formation.
    (b) Adjustment of Pool characteristics. SBA may adjust the Pool 
characteristics periodically based upon program experience and market 
conditions.


<R05>
Sec. 120.612  Loans eligible to back Certificates.

    (a) Pool Certificates are backed by the SBA guaranteed portions of 
loans comprising the Pool. An Individual Certificate is backed by the 
SBA guaranteed portion of a single loan. Any such loan must:
    (1) Be current as of the date the Pool is formed or the individual 
guaranteed

[[Page 172]]

portion of a loan is initially sold in the Secondary Market;
    (2) Be guaranteed under the Act; and
    (3) Meet such other standards as SBA may determine to be necessary 
for the successful operation of the Secondary Market program.
    (b) The loans that back a Pool must meet the SBA requirements in 
effect at the time the Pool is formed.


<R05>
Sec. 120.613  Secondary Participation Guarantee Agreement.

    When a Lender wants to sell the guaranteed portion of a loan, it 
enters into a Secondary Participation Guarantee Agreement (``SPGA'') 
with SBA and the prospective purchaser. The terms of sale between the 
Lender and the purchaser cannot require the Lender or SBA to repurchase 
the guaranteed portion of the loan except in accordance with the terms 
of the SPGA. Before execution of the SPGA, the Lender must:
    (a) Submit to FTA a copy of the proposed SPGA, the note, and such 
other documents as SBA may require;
    (b) Disburse to the Borrower the full amount of the loan; and
    (c) Pay SBA all guarantee fees relevant to the loan in full.

                   The SBA Guarantee of a Certificate


<R05>
Sec. 120.620  SBA guarantee of a Pool Certificate.

    (a) Extent of Guarantee. SBA guarantees to a Registered Holder the 
timely payment of principal and interest installments and any prepayment 
or other recovery of principal to which the Registered Holder is 
entitled. If the Borrower of a loan in a Pool backing the Certificates 
does not make a required installment payment, SBA, through the FTA, will 
make advances to maintain the schedule of interest and principal 
payments to the Registered Holders.
    (b) SBA guarantee backed by full faith and credit. SBA's guarantee 
of the Pool Certificate is backed by the full faith and credit of the 
United States.


<R05>
Sec. 120.621  SBA guarantee of an Individual Certificate.

    (a) Extent of SBA guarantee. With respect to Individual 
Certificates, SBA guarantees to purchase from the Registered Holder the 
guaranteed portion of the loan for an amount equal to the unpaid 
principal and accrued interest due as of the date of SBA's purchase, 
less deductions for applicable fees. Unlike the SBA guarantee with 
respect to pooled loans, SBA does not guarantee timely payment on 
Individual Certificates.
    (b) What triggers the SBA guarantee. SBA's guarantee to the 
Registered Holder may be called upon when:
    (1) The Borrower remains in uncured default for 60 days on payments 
of principal or interest due on the note;
    (2) The Lender fails to send to the FTA on a timely basis payments 
it received from the Borrower; or
    (3) The FTA fails to send to the Registered Holder on a timely basis 
any payments it has received from the Lender.
    (c) Full faith and credit. SBA's guarantee to the Registered Holder 
is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States.

of the AA/FA shall remain in effect pending resolution of the appeal.

                        Miscellaneous Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 120.640  Administration of the Pool and Individual Certificates.

    (a) FTA responsibility. The FTA has the responsibility to administer 
each Pool or Individual Certificate. It shall maintain a registry of 
Registered Holders and other information as SBA requires.
    (b) Self-liquidating. Each Pool or individual guaranteed portion of 
a loan in the Secondary Market is self-liquidating because of Borrower

it shall not have the unconditional guarantee of SBA.


<R05>
Sec. 120.645  Redemption of Certificates.

    (a) Redemption of Individual Certificate. The prepayment of the 
underlying loan or a default on such loan will trigger the redemption of

discretion, to be relevant to the broker's or dealer's fitness to 
participate in the Secondary Market;
    (2) The broker or dealer has been indicted or otherwise formally 
charged with a misdemeanor or felony which bears on its fitness to

<R05>
Sec. 120.700  What is the Microloan Program?

    The Microloan Demonstration Program assists women, low income 
individuals, minority entrepreneurs, and other small businesses which 
need small amounts of financial assistance. Under this program, SBA 
makes direct and guaranteed loans to Intermediaries (as defined below) 
who use the proceeds to make loans to eligible borrowers. SBA may also 
make grants under the program to Intermediaries and other qualified 
nonprofit entities to be used for marketing, management, and technical 
assistance to the program's target population.


<R05>
Sec. 120.701  Definitions.

    (a) Deposit account is a demand, time, savings, passbook, or similar 
account maintained with an insured depository institution (not including 
an account evidenced by a Certificate of Deposit).
    (b) Economically Distressed Area is a county or equivalent division 
of local government of a state in which, according to the most recent 
available data from the United States Bureau of the Census, 40 percent

poverty level.
    (c) Grant is a Federal award of money, or property in lieu of money 
(including cooperative agreements) to an eligible grantee that must

entity;
    (2) A consortium of private, nonprofit community development 
corporations or other entities;
    (3) A quasi-governmental economic development entity, other than a

    (4) An agency of or a nonprofit entity established by a Native 
American Tribal Government.
    (f) Microloan is a short-term, fixed interest rate loan of not more 
than $25,000 made by an Intermediary to an eligible small business.
    (g) Non-Federal sources are sources of funds other than the Federal 
Government and may include indirect costs or in-kind contributions paid 
for under non-Federal programs. Community Block Development Grants are 
considered non-Federal sources.
    (h) Specialized Intermediary is an Intermediary which maintains a 
portfolio of Microloans averaging $7,500 or less.


<R05>
Sec. 120.702  Are there limitations on who can be an Intermediary or on where an Intermediary may operate?

    (a) Prior experience requirement. To be eligible to be an 
Intermediary, an organization must:
    (1) Have made and serviced short-term fixed rate loans of not more 
than $25,000 to newly established or growing small businesses for at 
least one year; and
    (2) Have at least one year of experience providing technical 
assistance to its borrowers.
    (b) Limitation to one state. An Intermediary may not operate in more 
than one state unless the AA/FA determines that it would be in the best 
interests of the small business community for it to operate across state 
lines.


<R05>
Sec. 120.703  How does an organization apply to become an Intermediary?

    (a) Application Process. Organizations interested in becoming 
Intermediaries

[[Page 177]]

should contact SBA for information on the application process.
    (b) Documentation in support of application. The application must

counselors from the Service Corps of Retired Executives) to help 
Microloan borrowers.


<R05>
Sec. 120.704  How are applications evaluated?

    (a) Evaluation criteria. In selecting Intermediaries, SBA will 
attempt to insure that Microloans are available to small businesses in 
all industries and particularly to small businesses located in urban and 
rural areas.
    (b) Preference for organizations which make very small loans. In 
selecting Intermediaries, SBA will give priority to applicants which 
maintain a portfolio of loans averaging $7,500 or less.
    (c) Consideration of quasi-governmental organizations. Generally, 
SBA will consider applications by quasi-governmental organizations only 
when it determines that program services for a particular geographic 
area would be best provided by such organization.


<R05>
Sec. 120.705  What is a Specialized Intermediary?

    At the end of an Intermediary's first year of participation in the 
program, SBA will determine whether it qualifies as a Specialized 
Intermediary. An Intermediary qualifies as a Specialized Intermediary if 
it maintains a portfolio of Microloans averaging $7,500 or less. 
Specialized Intermediaries qualify for more favorable interest rates on 
SBA loans. If, after the first year, an Intermediary qualifies as a 
Specialized Intermediary, the special interest rate is applied 
retroactively to SBA loans made to the Intermediary. After the first 
year SBA will determine an Intermediary's qualifications as a 
Specialized Intermediary annually, based on its lending practices during 
the term of its participation in the program. Specialized Intermediaries 
also qualify for a greater amount of technical assistance grant funding.


<R05>
Sec. 120.706  What are the terms and conditions of an Intermediary SBA loan?

    (a) Loan Amount. An Intermediary may not borrow more than $750,000 
in the first year of participation in the program. In subsequent years, 
the Intermediary's obligations to SBA may not exceed an aggregate of 
$2.5 million, subject to statutory limitations on the total amount of 
funds available per state.
    (b) Repayment terms. During the first year of the loan, an 
Intermediary is not required to make any payments, but interest accrues 
from the date that SBA disburses the loan proceeds to the Intermediary. 
After that, SBA will determine the periodic payments. The loan must be 
repaid within 10 years.
    (c) Interest rate. The interest rate is equal to the rate applicable 
to five-year obligations of the United States Treasury, adjusted to the 
nearest one-eighth percent, less 1.25 percent. However, the interest 
rate for Specialized Intermediaries is equal to the rate applicable to 
five-year obligations of the United States Treasury, adjusted to the 
nearest one-eighth percent, less two percent.
    (d) Collateral. As security for repayment of the SBA loan, an 
Intermediary must pledge to SBA a first lien position in the MRF 
(described below), LLRF (described below), and all notes receivable from 
Microloans.
    (e) Default. If for any reason an Intermediary is unable to make 
payment to

[[Page 178]]

SBA when due, SBA may accelerate maturity of the loan and demand payment 
in full. In this event, or if an Intermediary violates this part or the 
terms of its loan agreement, it must surrender possession of all 
collateral described in paragraph (d) of this section to SBA. The 
Intermediary is not obligated to pay SBA any loss or deficiency which 
may remain after liquidation of the collateral unless the loss was 
caused by fraud, negligence, violation of any of the ethical 
requirements of Sec. 120.140, or violation of any other provision of 
this part.
    (f) Fees. SBA does not charge Intermediaries any fees for loans 
under this Program. An Intermediary may, however, pay minimal closing 
costs to third parties, such as filing and recording fees.


<R05>
Sec. 120.707  What conditions apply to loans by Intermediaries to Microloan borrowers?

    (a) General. An Intermediary may make Microloans to any small 
business eligible to receive financial assistance under this part. 
Proceeds from Microloans may be used only for working capital and 
acquisition of materials, supplies, furniture, fixtures, and equipment. 
SBA does not review Microloans for creditworthiness.
    (b) Amount and maturity. Generally, Intermediaries should not make a 
Microloan of more than $10,000 to any borrower. An Intermediary may not 
make a Microloan of more than $15,000 unless the borrower demonstrates 
that it is unable to obtain credit elsewhere at comparable interest 
rates and that it has good prospects for success. An Intermediary may 
not make a loan of more than $25,000, and no borrower may owe an 
Intermediary more than $25,000 at any one time. Each Microloan must be 
repaid within six years.
    (c) Interest rate. The maximum interest rate that can be charged a 
Microloan borrower is:
    (1) On loans of more than $7,500, the interest rate charged on the 
SBA loan to the Intermediary, plus 7.75 percentage points; and
    (2) On loans of $7,500 or less, the interest rate charged on the SBA 
loan to the Intermediary, plus 8.5 percentage points.


<R05>
Sec. 120.708  What is the Intermediary's financial contribution?

    The Intermediary must contribute from non-Federal sources an amount 
equal to 15 percent of any loan that it receives from SBA. The 
contribution may not be borrowed. For purposes of this program, 
Community Development Block Grants are considered non-Federal sources.


<R05>
Sec. 120.709  What is the Microloan Revolving Fund?

    The Microloan Revolving Fund (``MRF'') is an interest-bearing 
Deposit Account into which an Intermediary must deposit the proceeds 
from SBA loans, its contributions from non-Federal sources, and payments 
from its Microloan borrowers. An Intermediary may only withdraw from 
this account the money needed to establish the Loan Loss Reserve Fund 
(Sec. 120.710), proceeds for each Microloan it makes, and any payments 
to be made to SBA.


<R05>
Sec. 120.710  What is the Loan Loss Reserve Fund?

    (a) General. The Loan Loss Reserve Fund (``LLRF'') is an interest-
bearing Deposit Account which an Intermediary must establish to pay any 
shortage in the MRF caused by delinquencies or losses on Microloans. An 
Intermediary must maintain the LLRF until it has repaid all obligations 
it owes SBA.
    (b) Level of Loan Loss Reserve Fund in first year. In an 
Intermediary's first year, the balance on deposit in the LLRF must equal 
not less than 15 percent of the total outstanding balance of all notes 
receivable owed by its Microloan borrowers.
    (c) Level of Loan Loss Reserve Fund in subsequent years. In all 
subsequent years, an Intermediary must maintain a balance on deposit in 
the LLRF at a level which, at a minimum, reflects its loss experience as 
determined by SBA. However, the maximum amount required in the LLRF will 
not exceed 15 percent of the total outstanding balance owed by an 
Intermediary's Microloan borrowers.

[[Page 179]]


<R05>
Sec. 120.711  What rules govern Intermediaries?

    Intermediaries must operate in accordance with applicable statutes, 
regulations, policy notices, SBA's Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), 
and the information in the application.


<R05>
Sec. 120.712  How does an Intermediary get a grant to assist Microloan borrowers?

    (a) General. An Intermediary is eligible to receive grant funding 
from SBA of not more than 25 percent of the outstanding balance of all 
SBA loans to the Intermediary. The Intermediary must contribute, solely 
from non-Federal sources, an amount equal to 25 percent of the grant. 
Contributions may be made in cash or in kind.
    (b) Limitations on grant funds. An Intermediary may not borrow its 
contribution. It may only use grant funds to provide Microloan borrowers 
with marketing, management, and technical assistance, except that:
    (1) Up to 15 percent of the grant funds may be used to provide 
information and technical assistance to prospective Microloan borrowers; 
and
    (2) Grant monies may be used to attend training required by SBA. 
Intermediaries may not enter into third party contracts for the 
provision of technical assistance to program clients.
    (c) Exception to contribution requirement. Intermediaries which make 
at least 50 percent of their loans to small businesses located in or 
owned by residents of Economically Distressed Areas are not subject to 
the contribution requirement in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (d) Intermediaries eligible to receive additional grant monies. An 
Intermediary may receive an additional SBA grant equal to five percent 
of the outstanding balance of all loans received from SBA (with no 
obligation to contribute additional matching funds) if:
    (1) The Intermediary makes at least 25 percent of its loans to small 
businesses located in or owned by residents of an Economically 
Distressed Area; or
    (2) The Intermediary is a Specialized Intermediary.
    (e) SBA will determine an Intermediary's eligibility for all grants 
under this section separately for each loanmaking office or site.


<R05>
Sec. 120.713  Does SBA provide technical assistance to Intermediaries?

    SBA may procure technical assistance for an Intermediary to improve 
its knowledge, skill, and understanding of microlending by awarding a 
grant to a more experienced Intermediary. SBA may also obtain such 
assistance for prospective Intermediaries in areas of the country that 
are either not served or underserved by an existing Intermediary.


<R05>
Sec. 120.714  How does a non-Intermediary get a grant?

    (a) Grant procedure for non-Intermediaries. Any nonprofit entity 
that is not an Intermediary may apply to SBA for a grant to provide 
marketing, management and technical assistance to low-income individuals 
for the purpose of assisting them in obtaining private sector financing 
in amounts of $25,000 or less. To qualify, it must submit information 
regarding its ability to provide this assistance. If approved, the grant 
agreement will establish the terms and conditions for the grant.
    (b) Number and amounts of grants. In each year of the Microloan 
Program, SBA may make no more than 25 grants to non-Intermediaries for 
terms of up to five years. A grant may not exceed $125,000.
    (c) Contribution by nonprofit entity. The nonprofit entity must 
contribute an amount equal to 20 percent of the grant. The contribution 
from the nonprofit entity must come solely from non-Federal sources, and 
may include direct costs or in-kind contributions paid for under non-
Federal programs.


<R05>
Sec. 120.715  Does SBA guarantee any loans an Intermediary obtains from another source?

    (a) SBA may guarantee not less than 90 percent of no more than 10 
loans by for-profit or nonprofit entities (or an alliance of such 
entities) to Intermediaries located in urban areas and no more than 10 
loans by such entities to Intermediaries located in Rural Areas (as 
defined in Sec. 120.10).
    (b) Any loan guaranteed by SBA under this section will have a term 
of

[[Page 180]]

10 years. If an Intermediary receives such a loan, it will not need to 
repay any principal or interest during the first year, although the 
interest will accrue. During the second through fifth years, the 
Intermediary will pay interest only. During the sixth through tenth 
years, it will pay interest and fully amortize the principal.
    (c) The interest rate on any loan under this section shall be 
calculated as described in Sec. 120.706.


<R04>
            Subpart H--Development Company Loan Program (504)


<R05>
Sec. 120.800  What is the purpose of the 504 program?

    As authorized by Congress, SBA has established this program to 
foster economic development, create or preserve job opportunities, and 
stimulate growth, expansion, and modernization of small businesses.


<R05>
Sec. 120.801  How is a 504 Project financed?

    (a) A small business may apply for 504 financing through the CDC 
serving the area in which the 504 Project is located. SBA issues an 
Authorization if it agrees to guarantee part of the funding for a 
Project.
    (b) Usually, a Project requires interim financing from an interim 
lender (often the same lender that later provides a portion of the 
permanent financing).
    (c) Generally, permanent financing of the Project consists of:
    (1) A contribution by the small business in an amount of at least 10 
percent of the Project costs;
    (2) A loan made with the proceeds of a CDC Debenture for up to 40 
percent of the Project costs and certain administrative costs, 
collateralized by a second lien on the Project Property; and
    (3) A private sector loan comprising the balance of the financing, 
collateralized by a first lien on the Project property.
    (d) The Debenture is guaranteed 100 percent by SBA (with the full 
faith and credit of the United States), and sold to Underwriters who 
form Debenture Pools. Investors purchase interests in Debenture Pools 
and receive Certificates representing ownership of all or part of a 
Debenture Pool. SBA and CDCs use various agents to facilitate the sale 
and service of the Certificates and the orderly flow of funds among the 
parties.


<R05>

    (b) SBA will consider failure to file a petition before the end of 
the probationary period as a withdrawal from the 504 program. If the CDC 
elects ADC status or withdrawal, it must transfer all funded and/or 
approved loans to another CDC, SBA, or another servicer approved by SBA.

            Requirements for CDC Certification and Operation


<R05>

a CDC.


<R05>
Sec. 120.821  CDC Area of Operations.

    A CDC must have a designated Area of Operations, specified by the

    The CDC must have a Board of Directors chosen from the membership by 
the members, and representing at least three of the four membership 
groups. No single group shall control. The Board members must be 
responsible officials of the organizations they represent, and at least 
one must possess commercial lending experience. The Board must meet at 
least quarterly and shall be responsible for CDC staff decisions and 
actions. A quorum shall require at least 5 Directors. If there is a vote 
on loan approval or servicing actions, at least one Board member with 
commercial loan experience approved by SBA must be present and vote. As 
an alternative, the Board may obtain the recommendation of another 
person approved by SBA and possessing commercial lending experience.


<R05>
Sec. 120.824  Professional management and staff.

    A CDC must have full-time professional management, including an 
Executive Director (or the equivalent) managing daily operations. It

experience to market the 504 Program, package and process loan 
applications, close loans, service the loan portfolio, and sustain a 
sufficient level of service and activity in the Area of Operations.
    (a) Contracting out to third parties. CDCs may obtain, under 
contract, marketing, packaging, processing, and servicing services from 
qualified Lender Service Providers, as that term is defined in part 103 
of this chapter, located in the Area of Operations, subject to SBA's 
prior written approval. CDCs may contract for outside legal and 
accounting services without SBA approval. Compensation under all such 
contracts must be reasonable and customary for similar services in the 
Area of Operations. SBA may audit the contracts.
    (b) Contracting out to other CDCs. CDCs may contract with other CDCs 
for specific services, subject to SBA's prior written approval.


<R05>
Sec. 120.825  Financial ability to operate.

    A CDC must be able to sustain its operations continuously, with 
reliable sources of funds (such as income from services rendered and 
contributions from government or other sponsors).


<R05>
Sec. 120.826  Basic requirements for operating a CDC.

    A CDC must operate in accordance with applicable statutes, 
regulations, policy notices, SBA's SOPs, and the information in its 
application. It must supply to SBA current and accurate information 
about all certification and operational requirements, and maintain the 
records and submit the reports required by SBA.


<R05>
Sec. 120.827  Services a CDC provides to small businesses.

    (a) A CDC must operate in and adequately service its Area of 
Operations. It must market the 504 program, package and process 504 loan 
applications, and close and service 504 loans. A CDC's loan portfolio

    (b) A CDC may provide small businesses with financial and technical 
assistance, or may help small businesses obtain such assistance from 
other sources, including preparing, closing, and servicing loans under 
contract with Lenders in SBA's 7(a) program.
    (c) A CDC also may loan amounts to the Borrower equal to the value 
of all or part of the Borrower's contribution to a Project in the form 
of cash or land, including site improvements, previously acquired by the 
CDC.


<R05>
Sec. 120.828  Minimum level of CDC lending activity.

    A CDC must provide at least two 504 loan approvals each full fiscal 
year.


<R05>
Sec. 120.829  Job Opportunity average a CDC must maintain.

    (a) A CDC's portfolio must reflect an average of one Job Opportunity 
per $35,000 of 504 loan funding. The AA/FA may permit a CDC to average 
up to one per $45,000 for good cause in:
    (1) Alaska;
    (2) Hawaii;
    (3) State-designated urban or rural jobs and enterprise zones;

publication ``Area Trends.''
    (b) A CDC must indicate in its annual report the Job Opportunities 
actually or estimated to be provided by each Project.
    (c) If a CDC does not maintain the required average, it may retain 
its certification if it justifies to SBA's satisfaction its failure to

required average.


<R05>
Sec. 120.830  Reports a CDC must submit.

    A CDC must submit the following reports to SBA:

                  Extending a CDC'S Area of Operations


<R05>
Sec. 120.835  Application to extend an Area of Operations.

    SBA may expand a CDC's Area of Operations if the proposed Area of 
Operation is not being adequately served by existing CDC(s) and the 
expanding CDC is well-qualified to serve it. A CDC seeking to expand its 
Area of Operations must apply in writing to the SBA District Office 
serving the geographic area in which the CDC proposes to expand.
    (a) A CDC may submit an application to expand its Area of Operations 
if the existing CDCs serving the area have not averaged, over the last 
two years, at least one loan approval per 100,000 of general population 
in the Area of Operation. The one loan per 100,000 population 
requirement applies only to the area proposed for expansion, not the 
entire Area of Operations of the existing CDC or CDCs serving the 
expanded area.

    Example to paragraph (a) of this section. CDC A averages 0.8 loans 
per 100,000 of general population state-wide, but 1.2 loans per 100,000 
in city X. CDC B seeks to expand its Area of Operations only into city 
X. CDC B's application will be denied without further review because CDC 
A meets the 1 loan per 100,000 population requirement in the proposed 
expanded Area of Operation.

    (b) The application to expand must demonstrate to the satisfaction 
of SBA the expanding CDC's ability to provide full service to small 
businesses in the expanded territory, including processing, closing, 
servicing, and, if authorized, liquidating 504 loans. The expanding CDC 
must also demonstrate in its application that it will have a local 
presence and representation in the expanded Area of Operations before 
submitting any 504 loans for approval.


<R05>
Sec. 120.836  Public notice and opportunity for response.

    SBA will notify all CDCs servicing the proposed area of expansion, 
allowing at least 30 days for the existing CDCs to respond to the 
District Office. The expanding CDC also must publish a notice in a 
general circulation newspaper in the proposed area of expansion, 
advising of its intent to expand and giving the public at least 30 days 
to comment to SBA. The burden of proof in opposing the application will 
be upon the existing CDC or CDCs to show why SBA should not grant the 
application for extension.


<R05>
Sec. 120.837  SBA decision on application for extension.

    (a) The SBA District Office may consider any factor presented to it 
concerning the proposed area of expansion, the expanding CDC and its 
Area of Operations, and the existing CDC or CDCs serving the area, 
including the following: number of loan approvals per 100,000 of general 
population; number of loan approvals per 100,000 of small businesses; 
the density of small businesses; jobs created and retained; the number 
of 504 loan closings; the average 504 loan amount; urban, suburban, or 
rural character of the expanding area; the mix of small businesses; the 
prevailing economic conditions; servicing record

[[Page 184]]

and capabilities; currency rates; loss rates; other services provided to 
small businesses (technical and financial assistance); relationship with 
the local SBA office; and ties to and knowledge of the local community 
and its resources.
    (b) The SBA District Office will submit a recommendation, with any 
supporting materials, within 30 days of the end of the comment period to 
the AA/FA, who will make the final decision within 30 days of his or her 
receipt of the District Office's recommendation. In making its decision, 
SBA will consider all information submitted to it, as well as the 
currency of the expanding CDC's portfolio, including the default rate.


<R05>
Sec. 120.838  Expiration of existing, temporary expansions.

    All existing, temporary expansions of Areas of Operation shall 
expire 6 months after March 1, 1996, unless a CDC applies for permanent 
expansion before the expiration date.


<R05>
Sec. 120.839  Case-by-case extensions.

    (a) A CDC may apply to make an individual loan for a Project outside 
its Area of Operations to the District Office serving the area in which 
the Project will be located if:
    (1) The applicant CDC has previously assisted the business to obtain 
a 504 loan;
    (2) The applicant small business or CDC can document in writing to 
the AA/FA specific circumstances that would prevent the existing CDC or 
CDCs serving the area from assisting the business adequately; or
    (3) The existing CDC or CDCs serving the area agree to permit the 
applicant CDC to make the loan.
    (b) The applicant CDC must demonstrate that it adequately can 
service the loan.
    (c) The AA/FA may approve the request for good cause shown.

[61 FR 3235, Jan. 31, 1996; 61 FR 7986, Mar. 1, 1996]

                    Accredited Lenders Program (ALP)


<R05>
Sec. 120.840  Accredited Lenders Program.

    The SBA may designate a CDC as an Accredited Lender. SBA will 
provide an Accredited Lender with expedited loan processing or servicing 
action.
    (a) Applications. CDCs may apply to the SBA field office with which 
it is most active. The SBA office will send its recommendation and the 
application to the AA/FA for final decision.
    (b) Eligibility. In order to be eligible to receive Accredited 
Lender status, a CDC must have been an active participant in the 504 
loan program for not less than the preceding 12 months. In evaluating an 
application to be an Accredited Lender, SBA will consider all relevant 
factors, including:
    (1) The CDC's ability to work with the local SBA office;
    (2) The quality of past performance; and
    (3) The quality of the loan portfolio, including the default rate.
    (c) Term of designation. CDCs will be designated as ALPs for a two 
year period, and are eligible to renew the designation for additional 
two year periods.
    (d) Suspension and revocation. The AA/FA may suspend or revoke ALP 
designation upon written notice stating the reasons therefore at least 
10 business days prior to the effective date of the suspension or 
revocation. Reasons for suspension or revocation may include loan 
performance unacceptable to SBA or violations of applicable statutes, 
regulations or published SBA policies and procedures. An ALP may appeal 
the suspension or revocation made under this section pursuant to the 
procedures set forth in part 134 of this chapter. The action of the AA/
FA shall remain in effect pending resolution of the appeal.

                    Premier Certified Lenders Program


<R05>
Sec. 120.845  Premier Certified Lenders Program (PCLP).

    The SBA has established a pilot program to designate a number of 
CDCs as Premier Certified Lenders (``Premier CDCs''), and to authorize 
them to approve, close, service, foreclose, litigate, and liquidate 504 
loans subject to SBA regulations, procedures, and policies. A Premier 
CDC's authority to approve loans under the Program is subject to SBA's 
determination that the loan and

[[Page 185]]

Borrower meet SBA's eligibility requirements.
    (a) PCLP loan approvals. A Premier CDC notifies SBA of its approval 
of a PCLP loan by submitting appropriate documentation to SBA's loan 
processing center. SBA will notify the Premier CDC of the SBA loan 
number (if it does not identify a problem with eligibility, and funds 
are available).
    (b) Premier CDC Exposure. A Premier CDC must reimburse SBA for 10 
percent of any loss incurred by SBA as a result of a default by the 
Premier CDC on a Debenture issued under the PCLP (``Exposure'').
    (c) Loss reserve. A Premier CDC must establish a loss reserve to pay 
its Exposure to SBA.
    (1) Assets. A Premier CDC's loss reserve must be composed of any 
combination of: segregated funds on deposit in one or more federally 
insured depository institutions; or irrevocable letters of credit. All 
loss reserve deposits and letters of credit must be assigned by the 
Premier CDC to SBA in a manner acceptable to SBA. A Premier CDC's loss 
reserve deposits in an institution may exceed the institution's insured 
amount, but only if the institution is ``well capitalized'' as defined 
in regulations of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as amended 
(12 CFR 325.103) (``well capitalized bank''). A loss reserve irrevocable 
letter of credit must (i) be issued by a well capitalized bank, (ii) 
have a term equal to or longer than the term of the financings it 
secures, and (iii) be otherwise acceptable to the SBA.
    (2) Contributions. A Premier CDC's loss reserve must total 1 percent 
of the Debentures it issues under the PCLP Program. A Premier CDC must 
contribute 50 percent of the required loss reserve attributable to each 
financing when the Debenture it issues to fund the financing is closed, 
25 percent within 1 year after the Debenture is closed, and 25 percent 
within 2 years after the Debenture is closed.
    (3) Reimbursement. SBA determines a Premier CDC's Exposure on a loan 
and withdraws the amount necessary to cover the Exposure. If, after full 
use of any assets in the loss reserve, there are not enough loss reserve 
assets to cover a Premier CDC's Exposure, the Premier CDC must pay SBA 
any difference between the Exposure and the loss reserve assets 
withdrawn by SBA to cover the Exposure within 45 days of a demand for 
payment by SBA.
    (4) Replenishment. If SBA withdraws assets from the loss reserve to 
cover a Premier CDC's Exposure, the CDC must replace the withdrawn loss 
reserve assets within 30 days of the withdrawal with contributions equal 
to or greater than the amount of the assets withdrawn.
    (5) Withdrawal. A Premier CDC may withdraw loss reserve assets 
attributable to any repaid Debenture upon written approval by SBA.
    (d) Review. SBA will review a Premier CDC's financings annually.
    (e) Suspension and revocation. The AA/FA may suspend or revoke a 
CDC's Premier designation upon written notice stating the reasons for 
the suspension or revocation at least 10 business days prior to the 
effective date of the suspension or revocation. Reasons for suspension 
or revocation may include loan performance unacceptable to SBA, failure 
to meet loss reserve or eligibility criteria, or violations of 
applicable statutes, regulations, or published SBA policies and 
procedures. A Premier CDC may appeal the suspension or revocation made 
under this section pursuant to the procedures set forth in part 134 of 
this chapter. The action of the AA/FA shall remain in effect pending 
resolution of the appeal.
    (f) Applications. A CDC may obtain information concerning this pilot 
program from the Office of Program Development in the Office of 
Financial Assistance at SBA's Headquarters. A CDC may submit its 
application to the SBA field office in which it is most active. The SBA 
field office will send the application with its recommendation to the 
AA/FA for a final decision.
    (g) Acceptance into program. When determining a CDC's application, 
SBA will consider the CDC's ability to work with the local SBA office 
and the quality of past performance.
    (h) Program period. The PCLP pilot program ends on October 1, 2000.

                 Associate Development Companies (ADCs)


<R05>
Sec. 120.850  ADC functions.

    (a) An ADC must support local economic development efforts. An ADC 
may package, close, and service loans for a CDC under a written contract 
approved by SBA. Such contracts must meet Service Provider criteria, and 
specify the rights and responsibilities of the parties (including 
payment terms). The CDC remains solely responsible to SBA for the 
processing, closing, and servicing of the loan. It may not charge the 
Borrower a higher fee because it is using the ADC's services.
    (b) An ADC must operate in accordance with statutes, regulations, 
policy notices, SBA's Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), and the 
information in its application. It must supply to SBA current and 
accurate information about all certification and operational 
requirements, and maintain the records required by SBA.


<R05>
Sec. 120.851  ADC eligibility and operating requirements.

    (a) An ADC must demonstrate to SBA and maintain the following:
    (1) Adequate management ability;
    (2) A Board of Directors meeting at least quarterly and chosen from 
the membership by the members;
    (3) A professional staff, including at least one qualified full-time 
professional with small business lending experience available during 
regular business hours; and
    (4) A budget or financial statements showing the financial 
capability and funding to sustain continuing operations.
    (b) An ADC may contract out for staff services only if SBA gives 
prior approval. The contract, subject to SBA audit, may not be self-
serving, and compensation must be reasonable and customary.


<R05>
Sec. 120.852  Suspension and revocation of ADCs.

    SBA may require corrective action, or the AA/FA may suspend or 
revoke ADC status upon written notice stating the reasons therefore at 
least 10 business days prior to the effective date of the suspension or 
revocation. Reasons for suspension or revocation may include violations 
of applicable statutes, regulations or published SBA policies and 
procedures. An ADC may appeal the suspension or revocation made under 
this section pursuant to the procedures set forth in part 134 of this 
chapter. The action of the AA/FA shall remain in effect pending 
resolution of the appeal.

    (a) Any benefit flowing to an Associate or his or her employer from 
activities as an Associate must be merely incidental (this requirement 
does not prevent an Associate or an Associate's employer from engaging 
in a business relationship with the CDC and/or the Borrower in the 
regular course of business, including providing interim financing or 
Third-Party loans); and
    (b) Unless waived by SBA for good cause, an Associate may not be an 
officer, director, or manager of more than one CDC or ADC (except that 
the membership or Board of Directors of a broader-based CDC may include 
a member or director of a local CDC within its Area of Operations).

                 Leasing Policies Specific to 504 Loans


<R05>
Sec. 120.870  Leasing Project Property.

    (a) A Borrower may use the proceeds of a 504 loan to acquire, 
construct, or modify buildings and improvements, and/or to purchase and 
install machinery and equipment located on land leased to the Borrower 
by the CDC or an unrelated lessor if:
    (1) The remaining term of the lease, including options to renew, 
exercisable solely by the lessee, equals or exceeds the term of the 
Debenture, or, in the case of machinery or equipment, equals or exceeds 
the useful life of the property or the term of the Debenture, whichever 
is lesser;
    (2) The Borrower assigns its interest in the lease to the CDC with 
right of reassignment to SBA; and
    (3) The 504 loan is secured by a recorded lien against the leasehold 
estate and other collateral as necessary.
    (b) If a CDC leases property to a small business, the rent paid by 
the small business during the term of the Debenture must be enough to 
pay principal and interest on all debt incurred by the CDC to finance 
the Project, and all related expenses. The rent also may include a 
reasonable return on the CDC's investment.


<R05>
Sec. 120.871  Leasing part of an existing building to another business.

    (a) The costs of interior finishing of space to be leased out to 
another business are not eligible Project costs.
    (b) Third-party loan proceeds used to renovate the leased space do 
not count towards the 504 first mortgage requirement or the Borrower's 
contribution.

               Loan-Making Policies Specific to 504 Loans


<R05>
Sec. 120.880  Basic eligibility requirements.

    In addition to the eligibility requirements specified in subpart A, 
to be an eligible Borrower for a 504 loan, a small business must:
    (a) Use the Project Property (except that an Eligible Passive 
Company may lease to an Operating Company); and
    (b) Together with its affiliates, meet one of the following size 
standards:
    (1) It does not have a tangible net worth in excess of $6 million, 
and does not have an average net income after Federal income taxes 
(excluding any carry-over losses) for the preceding two years in excess 
of $2 million; or
    (2) It meets the size standards in part 121 of this chapter for the 
industry in which it is primarily engaged.


<R05>
Sec. 120.881  Ineligible Projects for 504 loans.

    In addition to the ineligible businesses and uses of proceeds 
specified in subpart A of this part, the following Projects are 
ineligible for 504 financing:

[[Page 188]]

    (a) Relocation of any of the operations of a small business which 
will cause a net reduction of one-third or more in the workforce of a 
relocating small business or a substantial increase in unemployment in 
any area of the country, unless the CDC can justify the loan because:
    (1) The relocation is for key economic reasons and crucial to the 
continued existence, economic wellbeing, and/or competitiveness of the 
applicant; and
    (2) The economic development benefits to the applicant and the 
receiving community outweigh the negative impact on the community from 
which the applicant is moving; and
    (b) Projects in foreign countries (loans financing real or personal 
property located outside the United States or its possessions).


<R05>
Sec. 120.882  Eligible Project costs for 504 loans.

    Eligible Project costs which may be paid with the proceeds of 504 
loans are:
    (a) Costs directly attributable to the Project including 
expenditures incurred by the Borrower (with its own funds or from a 
loan):
    (1) To acquire land used in the Project prior to applying to SBA for 
the 504 loan; or
    (2) For any other expense toward a Project within nine months prior 
to receipt by SBA of a complete loan application, unless the time limit 
is extended or waived by SBA for good cause;
    (b) In Projects involving construction, a contingency reserve for 
cost overruns not to exceed 10 percent of construction cost;
    (c) Professional fees directly attributable and essential to the 
Project, such as title insurance, architecture, engineering, accounting, 
environmental studies, and legal fees (other than legal fees associated 
with the closing); and
    (d) Repayment of interim financing including points, fees and 
interest.


<R05>
Sec. 120.883  Eligible administrative costs for 504 loans.

    (a) SBA guarantee fee;
    (b) Funding fee (to cover the cost of a public issuance of 
securities and the Trustee);
    (c) CDC processing fee;
    (d) Closing costs, other than legal fees; and
    (e) Underwriters fee.


<R05>
Sec. 120.884  Ineligible costs for 504 loans.

    Costs not directly attributable and necessary for the Project may 
not be paid with proceeds of the 504 loan. These include, but are not 
limited to, the following:
    (a) Debt refinancing (other than interim financing).
    (b) Third-Party Loan fees (commitment, broker, finders, origination, 
processing fees of permanent financing).
    (c) Ancillary business expenses, such as:
    (1) Working capital;

    (3) Construction equipment (except for heavy duty construction 
equipment integral to a business' operations and meeting the IRS 
definition of capital equipment).
    (e) Closing legal fees.

                            Interim Financing


<R05>
Sec. 120.890  Source of interim financing.

    A Project may use interim financing for all Project costs except the 
Borrower's contribution. Any source (including a CDC) may supply interim 
financing provided:
    (a) The financing is not derived from any SBA program, directly or 
indirectly;
    (b) The terms and conditions of the financing are acceptable to SBA;

[[Page 189]]

    (c) The source is not the Borrower or an Associate of the Borrower; 
and
    (d) The source has the experience and qualifications to monitor 
properly all Project construction and progress payments. (If the source 
lacks such experience or qualifications, SBA may require the interim 
loan to be managed by a third party such as a bank or professional 
construction manager.)


<R05>
Sec. 120.891  Certifications of disbursement and completion.

    Before the Debenture is issued, the interim lender must certify the 
amount disbursed. The CDC must certify that the Project was completed in 
accordance with the final plans and specifications (except as provided 
in Sec. 120.961).


<R05>
Sec. 120.892  Certifications of no adverse change.

    Following completion of the Project, the following certifications 
must be made before the 504 loan closing:
    (a) The interim lender must certify to the CDC that it has no 
knowledge of any unremedied substantial adverse change in the condition 
of the small business since the application to the interim lender;
    (b) The Borrower (or Operating Company) must certify to the CDC that 
there has been no unremedied substantial adverse change in its financial 
condition or its ability to repay the 504 loan since the date of 
application, and must furnish interim financial statements, current 
within 90 days of closing; and
    (c) The CDC must issue an opinion to the best of its knowledge that 
there has been no unremedied substantial adverse change in the 
Borrower's (or Operating Company's) ability to repay the 504 loan since 
its submission of the loan application to SBA.

                           Permanent Financing


<R05>
Sec. 120.900  What are the sources of permanent financing?

    Permanent financing for each Project must come from three sources: 
the Borrower's contribution, Third-Party Loans, and the 504 loan. 
Typically, the Borrower contributes 10 percent of the permanent 
financing, Third-Party Loans 50 percent and the 504 loan 40 percent.

                       The Borrower's Contribution


<R05>
Sec. 120.910  How much must the Borrower contribute?

    The Borrower must contribute to the Project cash (or property 
acceptable to SBA obtained with the cash) or land (that is part of the 
Project Property) valued at 10 percent or more of the Project cost 
(exclusive of administrative cost). The source of the contribution may 
be a CDC or any other source except an SBA business loan program (see 
Sec. 120.913 for SBIC exception).


<R05>
Sec. 120.911  Land contributions.

    The Borrower's contribution may be land (including buildings, 
structures and other site improvements which will be part of the Project 
Property) previously acquired by the Borrower or the CDC.


<R05>
Sec. 120.912  Borrowed contributions.

    The Borrower may borrow its cash contribution from the CDC or a 
third party. If any of the contribution is borrowed, the interest rate 
must be reasonable. If the loan is secured by any of the Project assets, 
the loan must be subordinate to the liens securing the 504 Loan, and the 
loan may not be repaid at a faster rate than the 504 Loan unless SBA 
gives prior written approval. A third party lender may not receive 
voting rights, stock options, or any other actual or potential voting 
interest in the small business.


<R05>
Sec. 120.913  May an SBIC provide the contribution?

    Subject to part 107 of this chapter, SBIC's may provide financing 
for all or part of the Borrower's contribution to the project. SBA shall 
consider SBIC funds to be derived from federal sources if the SBIC has 
leverage (as defined in part 107 of this chapter). If the SBIC does not 
have leverage, the investment will be considered to be from private 
funds. SBIC financing must be subordinated to the 504 loan and may not 
be repaid at a faster rate than the Debenture.

[[Page 190]]

                            Third Party Loans


<R05>
Sec. 120.920  The first lien position.

    The Borrower must obtain one or more Third Party Loans totaling at 
least as much as the 504 loan. Third Party Loans usually have the first 
lien position. They cannot be guaranteed by SBA.


<R05>
Sec. 120.921  Terms of Third Party loans.

    (a) Maturity. A Third Party Loan must have a term of at least 7 
years when the 504 loan is for a term of 10 years and 10 years when the 
504 loan is for 20 years. If there is more than one Third Party Loan, an 
overall loan maturity must be calculated, taking into account the 
maturities and amounts of each loan. If there is a balloon payment, it 
must be justified in the loan report and clearly identified in the Loan 
Authorization.
    (b) Interest rates. Interest rates must be reasonable. SBA must 
establish and publish in the Federal Register a maximum interest rate 
for any Third Party Loan from commercial financial institutions. The 
rate shall remain in effect until changed.
    (c) Other terms. The Third Party Loan must not have any early call 
feature or contain any demand provisions unless the loan is in default. 
By participating, a Third Party Loan lender waives, as to the CDC/SBA 
financing, any provision in its deed of trust, or mortgage, or other 
documents prohibiting further encumbrances or subordinate debt. In the 
event of default, the Third Party Lender must give the CDC and SBA 
written notice of default within 30 days of the event of default and at 
least 60 days prior to foreclosure.
    (d) Subordination. A Third-Party Loan lienholder must subordinate to 
the CDC/SBA lien any future advance in excess of the outstanding 
principal balance and accrued interest of the Third Party Loan at the 
time of such advance except expenditures for collection, maintenance, 
and protection of the Third Party Loan lienholder's lien position.
    (e) Escalation upon default. A Third-Party Lender may not escalate 
the rate of interest upon default to an amount greater than the maximum 
rate set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 120.922  Pre-existing debt on the Project Property.

    In addition to its share of Project cost, a Third-Party Loan may 
include consolidation of existing debt on the Project Property. The 
consolidation must not improve the lien position of the Lender on the 
pre-existing debt, unless the debt is a previous Third-Party Loan.


<R05>
Sec. 120.923  What are the policies on subordination?

    (a) Financing provided by the seller of Project Property must be 
subordinate to the 504 loan. SBA may waive the subordination requirement 
if the property is classified as ``other real estate owned'' by a 
national bank or other Federally regulated lender and SBA considers the 
property to be of sufficient value to support the 504 loan.
    (b) A Borrower is eligible for a 504 loan even if part of the 
Project financing is tax-exempt. SBA's lien position must not be 
subordinate to loans made from the proceeds of the tax-exempt 
obligation.


<R05>
Sec. 120.924  Prepayment of subordinate financing.

    The Borrower must not prepay any Project financing subordinate to 
the 504 loan without SBA's prior written consent.


<R05>
Sec. 120.925  Preferences.

    No Third Party Lender shall establish a Preference.


<R05>
Sec. 120.926  Referral fee.

    The CDC may receive a referral fee from the Third Party Lender if 
the CDC secured the lender for the Borrower under a written contract. 
The Borrower cannot pay this fee. If a CDC charges a referral fee, the 
CDC will be construed as a Referral Agent under part 103 of this 
chapter.

                        504 Loans and Debentures


<R05>
Sec. 120.930  Amount.

    (a) Generally, a 504 loan may not exceed 40 percent of total Project 
cost

[[Page 191]]

plus 100 percent of eligible administrative costs. For good cause shown, 
SBA may authorize an increase in the percentage of Project costs covered 
up to 50 percent. No more than 50 percent of eligible Project costs can 
be from Federal sources, whether received directly or indirectly through 
an intermediary.
    (b) Generally, the minimum 504 loan must be $50,000, although, upon 
good cause shown, SBA may permit a 504 loan as small as $25,000. The 
amount of the Debenture must equal the amount of the 504 Loan plus 
administrative costs.
    (c) Upon completion of the Project, the Debenture amount will be 
reduced by the amount that the unused contingency reserve exceeds 2 
percent of the anticipated Debenture.


<R05>
Sec. 120.931  504 lending limits.

    The outstanding balance of all SBA financial assistance to a 
Borrower and its affiliates under the 504 program covered by this part 
must not exceed $750,000 ($1,000,000 if one or more of the public policy 
goals enumerated in Sec. 120.862(b) applies to the Project).


<R05>
Sec. 120.932  Interest rate.

    The interest rate of the 504 Loan and the Debenture which funds it 
is set by the SBA and approved by the Secretary of the Treasury.


<R05>
Sec. 120.933  Maturity.

    The term of a 504 Loan and the Debenture which funds it shall be 
either 10 or 20 years.


<R05>
Sec. 120.934  Collateral.

    The CDC/SBA takes a junior lien position (usually a second lien) on 
the Project collateral. In rare circumstances, collateral other than the 
Project collateral may be accepted by SBA. Sometimes secondary 
collateral is required. All collateral must be insured against such 
hazards and risks as SBA may require, with provisions for notice to SBA 
and the CDC in the event of impending lapse of coverage.


<R05>
Sec. 120.935  Deposit.

    At the time of application for a 504 loan, the CDC may require a 
deposit from the Borrower of $2,500 or 1 percent of the Net Debenture 
Proceeds, whichever is less. The deposit may be applied to the loan 
processing fee if the application is accepted, but must be refunded if 
the application is denied. If the small business withdraws its 
application, the CDC may deduct from the deposit reasonable costs 
incurred in packaging and processing the application.


<R05>
Sec. 120.936  Subordination to CDC.

    SBA, in its sole discretion, may permit subordination of the 
Debenture to any other obligation of the CDC, except debt incurred by 
the CDC to obtain funds to loan to the Borrower for the Borrower's 
required contribution to the Project financing.


<R05>
Sec. 120.937  Assumption.

    A 504 loan may be assumed with SBA's prior written approval.


<R05>
Sec. 120.938  Default.

    (a) Upon occurrence of an event of default specified in the 504 note 
which requires automatic acceleration, the note becomes due and payable. 
Upon occurrence of an event of default which does not require automatic 
acceleration, SBA may forbear acceleration of the note and attempt to 
resolve the default. If the default is not cured subsequently, the note 
shall be accelerated. In either case, upon acceleration of the note, the 
Debenture which funded it is also due immediately, and SBA must honor 
its guarantee of the Debenture. SBA shall not reimburse the investor for 
any premium paid.
    (b) If a CDC defaults on a Debenture, SBA generally shall limit its 
recovery to the payments made by the small business to the CDC on the 
loan made from the Debenture proceeds, and the collateral securing the 
defaulted loan. However, SBA will look to the CDC for the entire amount 
of the Debenture in the case of fraud, negligence, or misrepresentation 
by the CDC.


<R05>
Sec. 120.939  Borrower prohibition.

    Neither a Borrower nor an Associate of the Borrower may purchase an 
interest in a Debenture Pool in which the Debenture that funded its 504 
loan has been placed.

[[Page 192]]


<R05>
Sec. 120.940  Prepayment of the 504 loan or Debenture.

    The Borrower may prepay its 504 loan, if it pays the entire 
principal balance, unpaid interest, any unpaid fees, and any prepayment 
premium established in the note. If the Borrower prepays, the CDC must 
prepay the corresponding Debenture with interest and premium. If one of 
the Debentures in a Debenture Pool is prepaid, the Investors in that 
Debenture Pool must be paid pro rata, and SBA's guarantee on the entire 
Debenture Pool must be proportionately reduced. If the entire Debenture 
Pool is paid off, SBA may call all Certificates backed by the Pool for 
redemption.

Sec. 120.954  Central Servicing Agent.

    (a) SBA has entered into a Master Servicing Agreement designating a 
Central Servicing Agent (CSA) to support the orderly flow of funds among 
Borrowers, CDCs, and SBA. The CDC and Borrower must enter into an 
individual Servicing Agent Agreement with the CSA for each 504 loan, 
constituting acceptance by the CDC and the Borrower of the terms of the 
Master Servicing Agreement.
    (b) The CSA has established a master reserve account. All funds 
related to the 504 loans and Debentures flow through the master reserve 
account under the provisions of the Master Servicing Agreement. The 
master reserve account will be funded by a guarantee fee, a funding fee

[[Page 193]]

payments of 504 loans. At SBA's direction, the CSA may use funds in the 
master reserve account to defray program expenses. In the event a 
Borrower defaults and its 504 note is accelerated, SBA shall add funds 
under its guarantee to ensure the full and timely payment of the 
Debenture which funded the 504 loan. At SBA's direction, the CSA must 
pay to the CDC servicing each loan the interest accruing in the master 
reserve account on loan payments made by each Borrower between the date 
of receipt of each monthly payment and the date of disbursement to 
investors. The CSA may disburse such interest periodically to CDCs on a

fitness to participate in the securities market. SBA must give the 
broker or dealer written notice, stating the reasons therefore, at least 
10 business days prior to the effective date of the suspension or 
revocation. A broker or dealer may appeal the suspension or revocation 
made under this section pursuant to the procedures set forth in part 134 
of this chapter. The action of the AA/FA will remain in effect pending 
resolution of the appeal. SBA may suspend or revoke the opportunity for

                           Servicing and Fees


<R05>
Sec. 120.970  Servicing of 504 loans and Debentures.

    The CDC must service the 504 loan in accordance with the Loan 
Authorization, these regulations, SBA policies and procedures, and 
prudent lending standards until paid in full, including review of the 
small business's financial statements, tax filings, insurance, and 
security filings. In doing so, CDCs must comply with the provisions of 
Sec. 120.513. In addition, CDCs must comply with the servicing 
requirements set forth in SBA's SOP. CDCs must report promptly to SBA 
any adverse trend, condition or information relevant to a Borrower. Upon 
request by a CDC, SBA may agree to defer a Borrower's monthly payment. 
SBA may negotiate agreements with CDCs to liquidate loans.


<R05>
Sec. 120.971  Allowable fees paid by Borrower.

    (a) CDC fees. CDCs may charge the following fees to the Borrower:
    (1) Processing fee. The CDC may charge up to 1.5 percent of the net 
Debenture proceeds to process the financing. Two-thirds of this fee will 
be considered earned and may be collected by the CDC when the 
Authorization for

[[Page 194]]

the Debenture is issued by SBA. The portion of the processing fee paid 
by the Borrower may be reimbursed from the Debenture proceeds;
    (2) Closing fee. The CDC may charge a fee to cover an amount 
sufficient to reimburse it for reasonable legal expenses of in-house or 
outside legal counsel. The CDC may also charge a fee to cover reasonable 
miscellaneous closing costs. Closing costs, other than legal fees, may 
be funded out of the Debenture proceeds;
    (3) Servicing fee. The CDC will charge a monthly servicing fee of 
not less than 0.5 percent per annum nor more than 2 percent per annum on 
the unpaid balance of the loan as determined at five-year anniversary 
intervals. A servicing fee in excess of 1.5 percent in a Rural Area and 
1 percent everywhere else requires SBA's prior written approval, based 
on evidence of substantial need. The servicing fee may be paid only from 
loan payments received. The fees may be accrued without interest and 
collected from the CSA when the payments are made;
    (4) Late fees. Loan payments received after the 15th of each month 
may be subject to a late payment fee of 5 percent of the late payment or 
$100, whichever is greater. These fees will be collected by the CSA on 
behalf of the CDC; and
    (5) Assumption fee. Upon SBA's written approval, a CDC may charge an 
assumption fee not to exceed 1 percent of the outstanding principal 
balance of the loan being assumed.
    (b) CSA fees. The CSA may charge an initiation fee on each loan and 
a monthly servicing fee under the terms of the Master Servicing 
Agreement.
    (c) Other agent fees. Agent fees and charges necessary to market and 
service Debentures and Certificates may be assessed to the Borrower or 
the investor. The fees must be approved by SBA and published 
periodically in the Federal Register.
    (d) SBA fees. (1) SBA charges a 0.5 percent guarantee fee on the 
Debenture.
    (2) For those loans approved after October 1, 1995, SBA charges a 
fee of 0.125 per annum on the unpaid principal balance of the loan as 
determined at five-year anniversary intervals.
    (e) Miscellaneous fees. A funding fee not to exceed 0.25 percent of 
the Debenture may be charged to cover costs incurred by the trustee, 
fiscal agent, transfer agent.


<R05>
Sec. 120.972  Oversight and evaluation of CDCs and ADCs.

    SBA may conduct an operational review of a CDC or ADC. The SBA 
Office of Inspector General may conduct, supervise or coordinate audits 
pursuant to the Inspector General Act. The CDC or ADC must cooperate and 
make its staff, records, and facilities available.

                 CDC Transfer, Suspension and Revocation


<R05>
Sec. 120.980  Transfer of CDC to ADC status.

    SBA shall transfer to ADC status any CDC that fails to meet the 
activity level required by SBA, on average over two consecutive fiscal 
years. SBA shall notify the CDC in writing of the action and of the 
opportunity for a hearing pursuant to part 134 of this chapter at least 
10 business days prior to the transfer. During the pendency of a 
hearing, SBA's action will remain in effect.


<R05>
Sec. 120.981  Voluntary transfer and surrender of CDC certification.

    A CDC may not transfer its certification or withdraw from the 504 
program without SBA's consent. The CDC must provide a plan to SBA to 
transfer its portfolio. The portfolio may only be transferred with SBA's 
written consent. If a CDC desires to withdraw from the 504 program, it 
must forfeit its portfolio to SBA. SBA may conduct an audit of the 
transferring or withdrawing CDC.


<R05>
Sec. 120.982  Correcting CDC servicing deficiencies.

    SBA may require corrective action, including the transfer of 
existing or pending financings to another CDC in good standing. SBA must 
notify the CDC in writing of any servicing, reporting or collection 
deficiencies and the corrective actions to be taken. SBA may instruct 
the CSA to withhold service and late fees and may assess the

[[Page 195]]

CDC up to $250 per day for expenses incurred by SBA to correct the 
deficiencies. If non-compliance continues for 90 days, SBA may take the 
fees as compensation for its efforts to obtain compliance.


<R05>
Sec. 120.983  Transfer of CDC servicing to SBA or another CDC.

    If a CDC fails to correct servicing deficiencies, or is unable or 
unwilling to service its portfolio, SBA may assume the servicing or 
require the transfer of all or part of the CDC's portfolio to another 
CDC within or adjoining the deficient CDC's Area of Operations. If there 
is no suitable CDC, SBA may approve a transfer to another entity. Future 
service fees from transferred loans will be paid to the transferee. In 
addition, the CDC's processing authority will be temporarily suspended.


<R05>
Sec. 120.984  Suspension or revocation of CDC certification.

    (a) Suspend or revoke. The AA/FA may suspend or revoke the CDC's 
certification if a CDC:
    (1) Violates a statute, an SBA regulation, or the terms of a 
Debenture, authorization, or agreement with SBA;
    (2) Makes a material false statement, knowingly misrepresents, or 
fails to state a material fact;
    (3) Fails to maintain good character;
    (4) Fails to operate according to prudent lending standards;
    (5) Fails to correct servicing, collection, reporting, or other 
deficiencies; or
    (6) Is unable or unwilling to operate in accordance with the 
requirements of this part.
    (b) Transfer portfolio. Upon suspension or revocation, the CDC must 
transfer its remaining portfolio and any 504 applications or financings 
in process to another CDC designated or approved by SBA. If a pending 
504 financing is completed after a transfer, any deposit must also be 
transferred. Any fees must be apportioned by SBA between the two CDCs in 
proportion to services performed.
    (c) Provide written notice. SBA must give written notice to the CDC 
at least 10 business days prior to the effective date of a suspension or 
revocation, informing the CDC of the opportunity for a hearing pursuant 
to part 134 of this chapter.

         Enforceability of 501, 502 and 503 Loans and Other Laws


<R05>
Sec. 120.990  501, 502 and 503 loans.

    SBA has discontinued loan programs for 501, 502, and 503 loans. 
Outstanding loans remain under these programs, and Borrowers, CDCs, and 
SBA must comply with the terms and conditions of the corresponding notes 
and Debentures, and the regulations in this part in effect when the 
obligations were undertaken or last in effect, if applicable.


<R05>
Sec. 120.991  Effect of other laws.

    No State or local law may preclude or limit SBA's exercise of its 
rights with respect to notes, guarantees, Debentures and Debenture 
Pools, or of its enforcement rights to foreclose on collateral.

          Subpart A--Size Eligibility Provisions and Standards

                   Provisions of General Applicability


<R05>
Sec. 121.101  What are SBA size standards?

    SBA's size standards define whether a business entity is small and, 
thus, eligible for Government programs and preferences reserved for 
``small business'' concerns. Size standards have been established for 
types of economic activity, or industry, generally under the Standard 
Industrial Classification (SIC) System. The SIC System is described in 
the ``Standard Industrial Classification Manual'' published by the 
Office of Management and Budget, Executive Office of the President, and 
sold by the U.S. Government Printing Office, Superintendent of 
Documents, P.O. Box 371954, Pittsburgh, PA 15250-7954. The SIC System 
assigns four-digit SIC codes to all economic activity within ten major 
divisions. Section 121.201 describes the size standards now established. 
A full table matching a size standard with each four-digit SIC code is 
also published annually by SBA in the Federal Register.


<R05>
Sec. 121.102  How does SBA establish size standards?

    (a) SBA considers economic characteristics comprising the structure 
of an industry, including degree of competition, average firm size, 
start-up costs and entry barriers, and distribution of firms by size. It 
also considers technological changes, competition from other industries, 
growth trends, historical activity within an industry, unique factors 
occurring in the industry which may distinguish small firms from other 
firms, and the objectives of its programs and the impact on those 
programs of different size standard levels.
    (b) As part of its review of a size standard, SBA will investigate 
if any concern at or below a particular standard would be dominant in 
the industry. SBA will take into consideration market share of a concern 
and other appropriate factors which may allow a concern to exercise a 
major controlling influence on a national basis in which a number of 
business concerns are engaged. Size standards seek to ensure that a 
concern that meets a specific size standard is not dominant in its field 
of operation.
    (c) Please address any requests to change existing size standards or 
establish new ones for emerging industries to the Assistant 
Administrator for Size

<R05>
Sec. 121.103  What is affiliation?

    (a) General Principles of Affiliation. (1) Concerns are affiliates 
of each other when one concern controls or has the power to control the 
other, or a third party or parties controls or has the power to control 
both.
    (2) SBA considers factors such as ownership, management, previous 
relationships with or ties to another concern, and contractual 
relationships, in determining whether affiliation exists.
    (3) Individuals or firms that have identical or substantially 
identical business or economic interests, such as family members, 
persons with common investments, or firms that are economically 
dependent through contractual or other relationships, may be treated as 
one party with such interests aggregated.
    (4) SBA counts the receipts or employees of the concern whose size 
is at issue and those of all its domestic and foreign affiliates, 
regardless of whether the affiliates are organized for profit, in 
determining the concern's size.
    (b) Exclusion from affiliation coverage. (1) Business concerns owned 
in whole or substantial part by investment companies licensed, or 
development companies qualifying, under the Small Business Investment 
Act of 1958, as amended, are not considered affiliates of such 
investment companies or development companies.
    (2) Business concerns owned and controlled by Indian Tribes, Alaska 
Regional or Village Corporations organized pursuant to the Alaska Native 
Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601), Native Hawaiian Organizations, 
or Community Development Corporations authorized by 42 U.S.C. 9805 are 
not considered affiliates of such entities, or with other concerns owned 
by these entities solely because of their common ownership.
    (3) Business concerns which are part of an SBA approved pool of 
concerns for a joint program of research and development as authorized 
by the Small Business Act are not affiliates of one another because of 
the pool.
    (4) Business concerns which lease employees from concerns primarily 
engaged in leasing employees to other businesses are not affiliated with 
the leasing company solely on the basis of a leasing agreement.
    (5) For financial, management or technical assistance under the 
Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended, (and applicant is not 
affiliated with the investors listed in paragraphs (b)(5) (i) through 
(vi) of this section.
    (i) Venture capital operating companies, as defined in the U.S. 
Department of Labor regulations found at 29 CFR 2510.3-101(d);
    (ii) Employee benefit or pension plans established and maintained by 
the Federal government or any state, or their political subdivisions, or 
any agency or instrumentality thereof, for the benefit of employees;
    (iii) Employee benefit or pension plans within the meaning of the 
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (29 U.S.C. 
1001, et seq.);
    (iv) Charitable trusts, foundations, endowments, or similar 
organizations exempt from Federal income taxation under section 501(c) 
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (26 U.S.C. 501(c));
    (v) Investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act 
of 1940, as amended (1940 Act) (15 U.S.C. 80a-1, et seq.); and
    (vi) Investment companies, as defined under the 1940 Act, which are 
not registered under the 1940 Act because they are beneficially owned by 
less than 100 persons, if the company's sales literature or 
organizational documents indicate that its principal purpose is 
investment in securities rather than the operation of commercial 
enterprises.
    (6) A protege firm is not an affiliate of a mentor firm solely 
because the protege firm receives assistance from the mentor firm under 
Federal Mentor-Protege programs.
    (c) Affiliation based on stock ownership. (1) A person is an 
affiliate of a concern if the person owns or controls, or has the power 
to control 50 percent or more of its voting stock, or a block of stock 
which affords control because

[[Page 199]]

it is large compared to other outstanding blocks of stock.
    (2) If two or more persons each owns, controls or has the power to 
control less than 50 percent of the voting stock of a concern, with 
minority holdings that are equal or approximately equal in size, but the 
aggregate of these minority holdings is large as compared with any other 
stock holding, each such person is presumed to be an affiliate of the 
concern.
    (d) Affiliation arising under stock options, convertible debentures, 
and agreements to merge. Since stock options, convertible debentures, 
and agreements to merge (including agreements in principle) affect the 
power to control a concern, SBA treats them as though the rights granted 
have been exercised (except that an affiliate cannot use them to appear 
to terminate control over another concern before it actually does so). 
SBA gives present effect to an agreement to merge or sell stock whether 
such agreement is unconditional, conditional, or finalized but 
unexecuted. Agreements to open or continue negotiations towards the 
possibility of a merger or a sale of stock at some later date are not 
considered ``agreements in principle'' and, thus, are not given present 
effect.
    (e) Affiliation based on common management. Affiliation arises where 
one or more officers, directors or general partners controls the board 
of directors and/or the management of another concern.
    (f) Affiliation based on joint venture arrangements. (1) Parties to 
a joint venture are affiliates if any one of them seeks SBA financial 
assistance for use in connection with the joint venture.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, concerns 
submitting offers on a particular procurement or property sale as joint 
venturers are affiliated with each other with regard to the performance 
of that contract.
    (3) Exclusion from affiliation. (i) A joint venture or teaming 
arrangement of two or more business concerns may submit an offer as a 
small business for a non-8(a) Federal procurement without regard to 
affiliation under paragraph (f) of this section so long as each concern 
is small under the size standard corresponding to the SIC code assigned 
to the contract, provided:
    (A) For a procurement having a revenue-based size standard, the 
procurement exceeds half the size standard corresponding to the SIC code 
assigned to the contract; or
    (B) For a procurement having an employee-based size standard, the 
procurement exceeds $10 million.
    (ii) A joint venture or teaming arrangement of at least one 8(a) 
Participant and one or more other business concerns may submit an offer 
for a competitive 8(a) procurement without regard to affiliation under 
paragraph (f) of this section so long as the requirements of 13 CFR 
124.513(b)(1) are met.
    (iii) Two firms approved by SBA to be a mentor and protege under 13 
CFR 124.520 may joint venture as a small business for any Federal 
Government procurement, provided the protege qualifies as small for the 
size standard corresponding to the SIC code assigned to the procurement 
and, for purposes of 8(a) sole source requirements, has not reached the 
dollar limit set forth in 13 CFR 124.519.
    (4) A contractor and subcontractor are treated as joint venturers if 
the ostensible subcontractor will perform primary and vital requirements 
of a contract or if the prime contractor is unusually reliant upon the 
ostensible subcontractor. All requirements of the contract are 
considered in reviewing such relationship, including contract 
management, technical responsibilities, and the percentage of 
subcontracted work.
    (5) For size purposes, a concern must include in its revenues its 
proportionate share of joint venture receipts.
    (g) Affiliation based on franchise and license agreements. The 
restraints imposed on a franchisee or licensee by its franchise or 
license agreement relating to standardized quality, advertising, 
accounting format and other similar provisions, generally will not be 
considered in determining whether the franchisor or licensor is 
affiliated with the franchisee or licensee provided the franchisee or 
licensee has the right to profit from its efforts and bears the risk of 
loss commensurate with ownership. Affiliation may arise, however,

[[Page 200]]

through other means, such as common ownership, common management or 
excessive restrictions upon the sale of the franchise interest.

<R05>
Sec. 121.104  How does SBA calculate annual receipts?

    (a) Definitions. In determining annual receipts of a concern:
    (1) Receipts means ``total income'' (or in the case of a sole 
proprietorship, ``gross income'') plus the ``cost of goods sold'' as 
these terms are defined or reported on Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 
Federal tax return forms (Form 1120 for corporations; Form 1120S for 
Subchapter S corporations; Form 1065 for partnerships; and Form 1040, 
Schedule F for farm or Schedule C for other sole proprietorships). 
However, the term receipts excludes net capital gains or losses, taxes 
collected for and remitted to a taxing authority if included in gross or 
total income, proceeds from the transactions between a concern and its 
domestic or foreign affiliates (if also excluded from gross or total 
income on a consolidated return filed with the IRS), and amounts 
collected for another by a travel agent, real estate agent, advertising 
agent, or conference management service provider.
    (2) Completed fiscal year means a taxable year including any short 
period. Taxable year and short period have the meaning attributed to 
them by the IRS.
    (3) Unless otherwise defined in this section, all terms shall have 
the meaning attributed to them by the IRS.
    (b) Period of measurement. (1) Annual receipts of a concern which 
has been in business for 3 or more completed fiscal years means the 
receipts of the concern over its last 3 completed fiscal years divided 
by three.
    (2) Annual receipts of a concern which has been in business for less 
than 3 complete fiscal years means the receipts for the period the 
concern has been in business divided by the number of weeks in business, 
multiplied by 52.
    (3) Annual receipts of a concern which has been in business 3 or 
more complete fiscal years but has a short year as one of those years 
means the receipts for the short year and the two full fiscal years 
divided by the number of weeks in the short year and the two full fiscal 
years, multiplied by 52.
    (c) Use of information other than the Federal tax return. Where 
other information gives SBA reason to regard Federal Income Tax returns 
as false, SBA may base its size determination on such other information.
    (d) Annual receipts of affiliates. (1) If a concern has acquired an 
affiliate or been acquired as an affiliate during the applicable 
averaging period or before small business self-certification, the annual 
receipts in determining size status include the receipts of both firms. 
Furthermore, this aggregation applies for the entire applicable period 
used in computing size rather than only for the period after the 
affiliation arose. Receipts are determined for the concern and its 
affiliates in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section even though 
this may result in different periods being used to calculate annual 
receipts.
    (2) The annual receipts of a former affiliate are not included as 
annual receipts if affiliation ceased before the date used for 
determining size. This exclusion of annual receipts of a former 
affiliate applies during the entire period used in computing size, 
rather than only for the period after which the affiliation ceased .


<R05>
Sec. 121.105  How does SBA define ``business concern or concern''?

    (a) A business concern eligible for assistance from SBA as a small 
business is a business entity organized for profit, with a place of 
business located in the United States, and which operates primarily 
within the United States or which makes a significant contribution to 
the U.S. economy through payment of taxes or use of American products, 
materials or labor.
    (b) A business concern may be in the legal form of an individual 
proprietorship, partnership, limited liability company, corporation, 
joint venture, association, trust or cooperative, except that where the 
form is a joint venture there can be no more than 49 percent 
participation by foreign business entities in the joint venture.

[[Page 201]]

    (c) A firm will not be treated as a separate business concern if a 
substantial portion of its assets and/or liabilities are the same as 
those of a predecessor entity. In such a case, the annual receipts and 
employees of the predecessor will be taken into account in determining 
size.


<R05>
Sec. 121.106  How does SBA calculate number of employees?

    (a) Employees counted in determining size include all individuals 
employed on a full-time, part-time, temporary, or other basis. SBA will 
consider the totality of the circumstances, including factors relevant 
for tax purposes, in determining whether individuals are employees of 
the concern in question.
    (b) Where the size standard is number of employees, the method for 
determining a concern's size includes the following principles:
    (1) The average number of employees of the concern is used 
(including the employees of its domestic and foreign affiliates) based 
upon numbers of employees for each of the pay periods for the preceding 
completed 12 calendar months.
    (2) Part-time and temporary employees are counted the same as full-
time employees.
    (3) If a concern has not been in business for 12 months, the average 
number of employees is used for each of the pay periods during which it 
has been in business.
    (4) The treatment of employees of former affiliates or recently 
acquired affiliates is the same as for size determinations using annual 
receipts in Sec. 121.104(d).


<R05>
Sec. 121.107  How does SBA determine a concern's ``primary industry''?

    In determining the primary industry in which a concern or a concern 
combined with its affiliates is engaged, SBA considers the distribution 
of receipts, employees and costs of doing business among the different 
industries in which business operations occurred for the most recently 
completed fiscal year. SBA may also consider other factors, such as the 
distribution of patents, contract awards, and assets.


<R05>
Sec. 121.108  What are the penalties for misrepresentation of size status?

    In addition to other laws which may be applicable, section 16(d) of 
the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 645(d), provides severe criminal 
penalties for knowingly misrepresenting the small business size status 
of a concern in connection with procurement programs. Section 16(a) of 
the Act also provides, in part, for criminal penalties for knowingly 
making false statements or misrepresentations to SBA for the purpose of 
influencing in any way the actions of the Agency.

          Size Standards Used To Define Small Business Concerns


<R05>
Sec. 121.201  What size standards has SBA identified by Standard Industrial Classification codes?

    The size standards described in this section apply to all SBA 
programs unless otherwise specified. The size standards themselves are 
expressed either in number of employees or annual receipts in millions 
of dollars, unless otherwise specified. The number of employees or 
annual receipts indicates the maximum allowed for a concern and its 
affiliates to be considered small. The following is a listing of size 
standards for industries under the SIC System. Size standards are listed 
by Division and apply to all industries in that Division except those 
specifically listed with separate size standards for a specific two-
digit major group or four-digit industry code. The industry code 
applicable to a business that cannot be otherwise classified will be SIC 
code 9999, Nonclassifiable Establishments, with a corresponding size 
standard of $5.0 million in annual receipts.

Footnotes:
\1\ SIC code 1629--Dredging: To be considered small for purposes of
  Government procurement, a firm must perform at least 40 percent of the
  volume dredged with its own equipment or equipment owned by another
  small dredging concern.
\2\ SIC Division D--Manufacturing: For rebuilding machinery or equipment
  on a factory basis, or equivalent, use the SIC code for a newly
  manufactured product. Concerns performing major rebuilding or overhaul
  activities do not necessarily have to meet the criteria for being a
  ``manufacturer'' although the activities may be classified under a
  manufacturing SIC code. Ordinary repair services or preservation are
  not considered rebuilding.
\3\ SIC code 2033: For purposes of Government procurement for food
  canning and preserving, the standard of 500 employees excludes
  agricultural labor as defined in section 3306(k) of the Internal
  Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. 3306(k).
\4\ SIC code 2911: For purposes of Government procurement, the firm may
  not have more than 1,500 employees nor more than 75,000 barrels per
  day capacity of petroleum-based inputs, including crude oil or bona
  fide feedstocks. Capacity includes owned or leased facilities as well
  as facilities under a processing agreement or an arrangement such as
  an exchange agreement or a throughput. The total product to be
  delivered under the contract must be at least 90 percent refined by
  the successful bidder from either crude oil or bona fide feedstocks.
\5\ SIC code 3011: For purposes of Government procurement, a firm is
  small for bidding on a contract for pneumatic tires within Census
  Classification codes 30111 and 30112, provided that:
(1) The value of tires within Census Classification codes 30111 and
  30112 which it manufactured in the United States during the previous
  calendar year is more than 50 percent of the value of its total
  worldwide manufacture;
(2) The value of pneumatic tires within Census Classification codes
  30111 and 30112 comprising its total worldwide manufacture during the
  preceding calendar year was less than 5 percent of the value of all
  such tires manufactured in the United States during that period; and
(3) the value of the principal product which it manufactured or
  otherwise produced, or sold worldwide during the preceding calendar
  year is less than 10 percent of the total value of such products
  manufactured or otherwise produced or sold in the United States during
  that period.
\6\ SIC codes 4724, 6531, 7311, 7312, 7313, 7319, and 8741 (part): As
  measured by total revenues, but excluding funds received in trust for
  an unaffiliated third party, such as bookings or sales subject to
  commissions. The commissions received are included as revenue.
\7\ A financial institution's assets are determined by averaging the
  assets reported on its four quarterly financial statements for the
  preceding year. Assets for the purposes of this size standard means
  the assets defined according to the Federal Financial Institutions
  Examination Council 034 call report form.
\8\ SIC code 6515: Leasing of building space to the Federal Government
  by Owners: For Government procurement, a size standard of $15.0
  million in gross receipts applies to the owners of building space
  leased to the Federal Government. The standard does not apply to an
  agent.
\9\ SIC codes 7699 and 3728: Contracts for the rebuilding or overhaul of
  aircraft ground support equipment on a contract basis are classified
  under SIC code 3728.
\10\ SIC code 8731: For research and development contracts requiring the
  delivery of a manufactured product, the appropriate size standard is
  that of the manufacturing industry.
(1) Research and Development means laboratory or other physical research
  and development. It does not include economic, educational,
  engineering, operations, systems, or other nonphysical research; or
  computer programming, data processing, commercial and/or medical
  laboratory testing.
(2) For purposes of the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
  program only, a different definition has been established by law. See
  Sec.  121.701.
(3) Research and development for guided missiles and space vehicles
  includes evaluations and simulation, and other services requiring
  thorough knowledge of complete missiles and spacecraft.
\11\ Facilities Management, a component of SIC code 8744, includes
  establishments, not elsewhere classified, which provide overall
  management and the personnel to perform a variety of related support
  services in operating a complete facility in or around a specific
  building, or within another business or Government establishment.
  Facilities management means furnishing three or more personnel supply
  services which may include, but are not limited to, secretarial
  services, typists, telephone answering, reproduction or mimeograph
  service, mailing service, financial or business management, public
  relations, conference planning, travel arrangements, word processing,
  maintaining files and/or libraries, switchboard operation, writers,
  bookkeeping, minor office equipment maintenance and repair, or use of
  information systems (not programming).
\12\ SIC code 8744:
(1) If one of the activities of base maintenance, as defined in
  paragraph (2) of this footnote, can be identified with a separate
  industry and that activity (or industry) accounts for 50 percent or
  more of the value of an entire contract, then the proper size standard
  is that of the particular industry, and not the base maintenance size
  standard.
(2) ``Base Maintenance'' requires the performance of three or more
  separate activities in the areas of service or special trade
  construction industries. If services are performed, these activities
  must each be in a separate SIC code including, but not limited to,
  Janitorial and Custodial Service, Fire Prevention Service, Messenger
  Service, Commissary Service, Protective Guard Service, and Grounds
  Maintenance and Landscaping Service. If the contract requires the use
  of special trade contractors (plumbing, painting, plastering,
  carpentry, etc.), all such special trade construction activities are
  considered a single activity and classified as Base Housing
  Maintenance. Since Base Housing Maintenance is only one activity, two
  additional activities are required for a contract to be classified as
  ``Base Maintenance.''

[[Page 207]]

 
\13\ SIC code 8744: (1) For SBA assistance as a small business concern
  in the industry of Environmental Remediation Services, other than for
  Government procurement, a concern must be engaged primarily in
  furnishing a range of services for the remediation of a contaminated
  environment to an acceptable condition including, but not limited to,
  preliminary assessment, site inspection, testing, remedial
  investigation, feasibility studies, remedial design, containment,
  remedial action, removal of contaminated materials, storage of
  contaminated materials and security and site closeouts. If one of such
  activities accounts for 50 percent or more of a concern's total
  revenues, employees, or other related factors, the concern's primary
  industry is that of the particular industry and not the Environmental
  Remediation Services Industry.
(2) For purposes of classifying a Government procurement as
  Environmental Remediation Services, the general purpose of the
  procurement must be to restore a contaminated environment and also the
  procurement must be composed of activities in three or more separate
  industries with separate SIC codes or, in some instances (e.g.,
  engineering), smaller sub-components of SIC codes with separate,
  distinct size standards. These activities may include, but are not
  limited to, separate activities in industries such as: Heavy
  Construction; Special Trade Construction; Engineering Services;
  Architectural Services; Management Services; Refuse Systems; Sanitary
  Services, Not Elsewhere Classified; Local Trucking Without Storage;
  Testing Laboratories; and Commercial, Physical and Biological
  Research. If any activity in the procurement can be identified with a
  separate SIC code, or component of a code with a separate distinct
  size standard, and that industry accounts for 50 percent or more of
  the value of the entire procurement, then the proper size standard is
  the one for that particular industry, and not the Environmental
  Remediation Service size standard.

       Size Eligibility Requirements For SBA Financial Assistance


<R05>
Sec. 121.301  What size standards are applicable to financial assistance programs?

    (a) For Business Loans and Disaster Loans (other than physical 
disaster loans), an applicant must not exceed the size standard for the 
industry in which:
    (1) The applicant combined with its affiliates is primarily engaged; 
and
    (2) The applicant alone is primarily engaged.
    (b) For Development Company programs, an applicant must meet one of 
the following standards:
    (1) Including its affiliates, tangible net worth not in excess of $6 
million, and average net income after Federal income taxes (excluding 
any carry-over losses) for the preceding two completed fiscal years not 
in excess of $2 million; or
    (2) The same standards applicable under paragraph (a) of this 
section.
    (c) For the Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) program, an 
applicant must meet one of the following standards:
    (1) Including its affiliates, tangible net worth not in excess of 
$18 million, and average net income after Federal income taxes 
(excluding any carry-over losses) for the preceding 2 completed fiscal 
years not in excess of $6 million; or
    (2) The same standards applicable under paragraph (a) of this 
section.
    (d) For Surety Bond Guarantee assistance--
    (1) Any construction (general or special trade) concern or concern 
performing a contract for services is small if its average annual 
receipts do not exceed $5.0 million.
    (2) Any concern not specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section 
must meet the size standard for the primary industry in which it, 
combined with its affiliates, is engaged.
    (e) The applicable size standards for the purpose of all SBA 
financial assistance programs, excluding the Surety Bond Guarantee 
assistance program, are increased by 25 percent whenever the applicant 
agrees to use the assistance within a labor surplus area. Labor surplus 
areas are listed monthly in the Department of Labor publication called 
``Area Trends.''


<R05>
Sec. 121.302  When does SBA determine the size status of an applicant?

    (a) The size of an applicant for SBA financial assistance is 
determined as of the date the application for such financial assistance 
is accepted for processing by SBA, except for the Disaster Loan and 
Preferred Lenders programs.
    (b) For the Preferred Lenders program, size is determined as of the 
date of approval of the loan by the Preferred Lender.
    (c) For disaster loan assistance (other than physical disaster 
loans), size status is determined as of the date the disaster commenced, 
as set forth in the Disaster Declaration.
    (d) Changes in size subsequent to the applicable date when size is 
determined will not disqualify an applicant for assistance.

[[Page 208]]


<R05>
Sec. 121.303  What size procedures are used by SBA before it makes a formal size determination?

    (a) A concern that submits an application for financial assistance 
is deemed to have certified that it is small under the applicable size 
standard. SBA may question the concern's status based on information 
supplied in the application or from any other source.
    (b) A small business investment company, a development company, a 
surety bond company, or a preferred lender may accept as true the size 
information provided by an applicant, unless credible evidence to the 
contrary is apparent.
    (c) Size is initially considered by the individual with final 
financial assistance authority. This is not a formal size determination. 
A formal determination may be requested prior to a denial of eligibility 
based on size.
    (d) An applicant may request a formal size determination when 
assistance has been denied for size ineligibility. Except for disaster 
loan eligibility, a request for a formal size determination must be made 
to the Government Contracting Area Director serving the area in which 
the headquarters of the applicant is located, regardless of the location 
of the parent company or affiliates. For disaster loan assistance, the 
request for a size determination must be made to the Area Director for 
the Disaster Area Office which denied the assistance.
    (e) There are no time limitations for making a formal size 
determination for purposes of financial assistance. The official making 
the formal size determination must provide a copy of the determination 
to the applicant, to the requesting SBA official, and to other 
interested SBA program officials.


<R05>
Sec. 121.304  What are the size requirements for refinancing an existing SBA loan?

    (a) A concern that applies to refinance an existing SBA loan or 
guarantee will be considered small for the refinancing even though its 
size has increased since the date of the original financing to exceed 
its applicable size standard, provided that:
    (1) The increase in size is due to natural growth (as distinguished 
from merger, acquisition or similar management action); and
    (2) SBA determines that refinancing is necessary to protect the 
Government's financial interest.
    (b) If a concern's size has increased other than by natural growth, 
the concern and its affiliates must be small at the time the application 
for refinancing is accepted for processing by SBA.


<R05>
Sec. 121.305  What size eligibility requirements exist for obtaining business loans relating to particular procurements?

    A concern qualified as small for a particular procurement, including 
an 8(a) subcontract, is small for financial assistance directly and 
primarily relating to the performance of the particular procurement.

        Size Eligibility Requirements for Government Procurement


<R05>
Sec. 121.401  What procurement programs are subject to size determinations?

    The requirements set forth in Secs. 121.401 through 121.413 cover 
all procurement programs for which status as a small business is 
required, including the small business set-aside program, SBA's 
Certificate of Competency program, SBA's 8(a) Business Development 
program, the Small Business Subcontracting program authorized under 
section 8(d) of the Small Business Act, the Federal Small Disadvantaged 
Business (SDB) programs, the HUBZone program, and the Very Small 
Business (VSB) program.

[63 FR 46642, Sept. 2, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 121.402  What size standards are applicable to procurement assistance programs?

    (a) A concern must meet the size standard for the SIC code specified 
in the solicitation.
    (b) The procuring agency contracting officer, or authorized 
representative, designates the proper SIC code and size standard in a 
solicitation, selecting the SIC code which best describes the principal 
purpose of the product or service being acquired. Primary consideration 
is given to the industry descriptions in

[[Page 209]]

the SIC Manual, the product or service description in the solicitation 
and any attachments to it, the relative value and importance of the 
components of the procurement making up the end item being procured, and 
the function of the goods or services being purchased. Other factors 
considered include previous Government procurement classifications of 
the same or similar products or services, and the classification which 
would best serve the purposes of the Small Business Act. A procurement 
is usually classified according to the component which accounts for the 
greatest percentage of contract value.
    (c) The SIC code assigned to a procurement and its corresponding 
size standard is final unless timely appealed to SBA's Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (OHA), or unless SBA assigns a SIC code or size 
standard as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (d) An unclear, incomplete or missing SIC code designation or size 
standard in the solicitation may be clarified, completed or supplied by 
SBA in connection with a formal size determination or size appeal.
    (e) Any offeror or other interested party adversely affected by a 
SIC code designation or size standard designation may appeal the 
designations to OHA under part 134 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 121.403  Are SBA size determinations and SIC code designations binding on parties?

    Formal size determinations and SIC code designations made by 
authorized SBA officials are binding upon the parties. Opinions 
otherwise provided by SBA officials to contracting officers or others 
are advisory in nature, and are not binding or appealable.


<R05>
Sec. 121.404  When does SBA determine the size status of a business concern?

    Generally, SBA determines the size status of a concern (including 
its affiliates) as of the date the concern submits a written self-
certification that it is small to the procuring agency as part of its 
initial offer including price. The following are two exceptions to this 
rule:
    (a) The size status of an applicant for a Certificate of Competency 
(COC) relating to an unrestricted procurement is determined as of the 
date of the concern's application for the COC.
    (b) Size status for purposes of compliance with the nonmanufacturer 
rule set forth in Sec. 121.406(b)(1) and the ostensible subcontractor 
rule set forth in Sec. 121.103(f)(3) is determined as of the date of the 
best and final offer.


<R05>
Sec. 121.405  May a business concern self-certify its small business size status?

    (a) A concern must self-certify it is small under the size standard 
specified in the solicitation, or as clarified, completed or supplied by 
SBA pursuant to Sec. 121.402(d).
    (b) A contracting officer may accept a concern's self-certification 
as true for the particular procurement involved in the absence of a 
written protest by other offerors or other credible information which 
causes the contracting officer or SBA to question the size of the 
concern.
    (c) Procedures for protesting the self-certification of an offeror 
are set forth in Secs. 121.1001 through 121.1009.


<R05>
Sec. 121.406  How does a small business concern qualify to provide manufactured products under small business set-aside or MED procurements?

    (a) General. In order to qualify as a small business concern for a 
small business set-aside or 8(a) contract to provide manufactured 
products, an offeror must either:
    (1) Be the manufacturer of the end item being procured (and the end 
item must be manufactured or produced in the United States); or
    (2) Comply with the requirements of paragraph (b), (c) or (d) of 
this section as a nonmanufacturer, a kit assembler or a supplier under 
Simplified Acquisition Procedures.
    (b) Nonmanufacturers. (1) A concern may qualify for a requirement to 
provide manufactured products as a nonmanufacturer if it:
    (i) Does not exceed 500 employees;
    (ii) Is primarily engaged in the wholesale or retail trade and 
normally sells the items being supplied to the general public; and

[[Page 210]]

    (iii) Will supply the end item of a small business manufacturer or 
processor made in the United States, or obtains a waiver of such 
requirement pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
    (2) For size purposes, there can be only one manufacturer of the end 
item being acquired. The manufacturer is the concern which, with its own 
facilities, performs the primary activities in transforming inorganic or 
organic substances, including the assembly of parts and components, into 
the end item being acquired. The end item must possess characteristics 
which, as a result of mechanical, chemical or human action, it did not 
possess before the original substances, parts or components were 
assembled or transformed. The end item may be finished and ready for 
utilization or consumption, or it may be semifinished as a raw material 
to be used in further manufacturing. Firms which perform only minimal 
operations upon the item being procured do not qualify as manufacturers 
of the end item. SBA will evaluate the following factors in determining 
whether a concern is the manufacturer of the end item:
    (i) The proportion of total value in the end item added by the 
efforts of the concern, excluding costs of overhead, testing, quality 
control, and profit; and
    (ii) The importance of the elements added by the concern to the 
function of the end item, regardless of their relative value.
    (3) The Administrator or designee may waive the requirement set 
forth in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section under the following two 
circumstances:
    (i) The contracting officer has determined that no small business 
manufacturer or processor reasonably can be expected to offer a product 
meeting the specifications (including period for performance) required 
by a particular solicitation and SBA reviews and accepts that 
determination; or
    (ii) SBA determines that no small business manufacturer or processor 
of the product or class of products is available to participate in the 
Federal procurement market.
    (4) The two waiver possibilities identified in paragraph (b)(3) of 
this section are called ``individual'' and ``class'' waivers 
respectively, and the procedures for them are contained in Sec. 121.1204 
.
    (5) Any SBA waiver of the nonmanufacturer rule has no effect on 
requirements external to the Small Business Act which involve domestic 
sources of supply, such as the Buy American Act.
    (c) Kit assemblers. (1) Where the manufactured item being acquired 
is a kit of supplies or other goods provided by an offeror for a special 
purpose, the offeror cannot exceed 500 employees, and 50 percent of the 
total value of the components of the kit must be manufactured by 
business concerns in the United States which are small under the size 
standards for the SIC codes of the components being assembled. The 
offeror need not itself be the manufacturer of any of the items 
assembled.
    (2) Where the Government has specified an item for the kit which is 
not produced by U.S. small business concerns, such item shall be 
excluded from the calculation of total value in paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section.
    (d) Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Where the procurement of a 
manufactured item is processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures, 
as defined in Sec. 13.101 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 
(48 CFR 13.101), and where the anticipated cost of the procurement will 
not exceed $25,000, the offeror need not supply the end product of a 
small business concern as long as the product acquired is manufactured 
or produced in the United States, and the offeror does not exceed 500 
employees. The offeror need not itself be the manufacturer of any of the 
items acquired.

<R05>
Sec. 121.407  What are the size procedures for multiple item procurements?

    If a procurement calls for two or more specific end items or types 
of services with different size standards and the offeror may submit an 
offer on any or all end items or types of services, the offeror must 
meet the size standard for each end item or service item for which it 
submits an offer. If the procurement calls for more than one specific 
end item or type of service and an offeror is required to submit an

[[Page 211]]

offer on all items, the offeror may qualify as a small business for the 
procurement if it meets the size standard of the item which accounts for 
the greatest percentage of the total contract value.


<R05>
Sec. 121.408  What are the size procedures for SBA's Certificate of Competency Program?

    (a) A firm which applies for a COC must file an ``Application for 
Small Business Size Determination'' (SBA Form 355). If the initial 
review of SBA Form 355 indicates the applicant, including its 
affiliates, is small for purposes of the COC program, SBA will process 
the application for COC. If the review indicates the applicant, 
including its affiliates, is other than small, SBA will initiate a 
formal size determination as set forth in Sec. 121.1009. In such a case, 
SBA will not further process the COC application until a formal size 
determination is made.
    (b) A concern is ineligible for a COC if a formal SBA size 
determination finds the concern other than small.


<R05>
Sec. 121.409  What size standard applies in an unrestricted procurement for Certificate of Competency purposes?

    For the purpose of receiving a Certificate of Competency in an 
unrestricted procurement, the applicable size standard is that 
corresponding to the SIC code set forth in the solicitation. For a 
manufactured product, a concern must also furnish a domestically 
produced or manufactured product, regardless of the size status of the 
product manufacturer. The offeror need not be the manufacturer of any of 
the items acquired.


<R05>
Sec. 121.410  What are the size standards for SBA's Section 8(d) Subcontracting Program?

    For subcontracting purposes pursuant to section 8(d) of the Small 
Business Act, a concern is small:
    (a) For subcontracts of $10,000 or less which relate to Government 
procurements, if its number of employees (including its affiliates) does 
not exceed 500 employees. However, subcontracts for engineering services 
awarded under the National Energy Policy Act of 1992 have the same size 
standard as Military and Aerospace Equipment and Military Weapons under 
SIC code 8711;
    (b) For subcontracts exceeding $10,000 which relate to Government 
procurements, if its number of employees or average annual receipts 
(including its affiliates) does not exceed the size standard for the 
product or service it is providing on the subcontract; and
    (c) For subcontracts for financial services, if the concern 
(including its affiliates) is a commercial bank or savings and loan 
association whose assets do not exceed $100 million.


<R05>
Sec. 121.411  What are the size procedures for SBA's Section 8(d) Subcontracting Program?

    (a) Prime contractors may rely on the information contained in SBA's 
Procurement Automated Source System (PASS), or equivalent data base 
maintained or sanctioned by SBA, as an accurate representation of a 
concern's size and ownership characteristics for purposes of maintaining 
a small business source list. Even though a concern is on a small 
business source list, it must still qualify and self-certify as a small 
business at the time it submits its offer as a section 8(d) 
subcontractor.
    (b) Upon determination of the successful subcontract offeror for a 
competitive subcontract, but prior to award, the prime contractor must 
inform each unsuccessful subcontract offeror in writing of the name and 
location of the apparent successful offeror.
    (c) The self-certification of a concern subcontracting or proposing 
to subcontract under section 8(d) of the Small Business Act may be 
protested by the contracting officer, the prime contractor, the 
appropriate SBA official or any other interested party.


<R05>
Sec. 121.412  What are the size procedures for partial small business set-asides?

    A firm is required to meet size standard requirements only for the 
small business set-aside portion of a procurement, and is not required 
to qualify as a small business for the unrestricted portion.

[[Page 212]]


<R05>
Sec. 121.413  What size must a concern be to be eligible for the Very Small Business program?

    A concern is a very small business (see Sec. 125.7 of this chapter) 
if, together with its affiliates, it has no more than 15 employees and 
its average annual receipts do not exceed $1 million.

manufacture of lumber and wood related products such as veneer, plywood, 
hardboard, particle board, or wood pulp, and of products of which lumber 
or wood related products are the principal raw materials.
    (b) Logging of timber means felling and bucking, yarding, and/or 
loading. It does not mean hauling.
    (c) Manufacture of logs means, at a minimum, breaking down logs into 
rough cuts of the finished product.
    (d) Sell means, in addition to its usual and customary meaning, the 
exchange of sawlogs for sawlogs on a product-for-product basis with or 
without monetary adjustment, and an indirect transfer, such as the sale 
of the assets of a concern after it has been awarded one or more set-
aside sales of timber.
    (e) Significant logging of timber means that a concern uses its own 
employees to perform at least two of the following: felling and bucking,

section; and
    (iii) Agree that if it becomes acquired or controlled by a business 
which does not meet the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of 
this section, it will require as a condition of the acquisition or 
change of control that the acquiring or controlling business resell at 
least 70% of the sawtimber volume to businesses which do meet the 
requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section; or
    (4) If it intends at the time of offer to resell the timber--
    (i) Agree that it will not sell more than 30% of such timber (50% of

 Size Eligibility Requirements for the Minority Enterprise Development 
                              (MED) Program


<R05>
Sec. 121.601  What is a small business for purposes of admission to SBA's Minority Enterprise Development (MED) program?

    An applicant must be small under the size standard corresponding to 
its primary industry classification in order to be admitted to SBA's 
Minority Enterprise Development (MED) program.


<R05>
Sec. 121.602  At what point in time must a MED applicant be small?

    A MED applicant must be small for its primary industry at the time 
SBA certifies it for admission into the program.


<R05>
Sec. 121.603  How does SBA determine whether a Participant is small for a particular MED subcontract?

    (a) Self certification by Participant. A MED Participant must 
certify that it qualifies as a small business under the SIC code 
assigned to a particular MED subcontract as part of its initial offer 
including price to the procuring agency. The Participant also must 
submit a copy of its offer, including its self-certification as to size, 
to the appropriate SBA district office at the same time it submits the 
offer to the procuring agency. See Sec. 121.404 for the time at which 
size is determined for, and Sec. 121.406 for the applicability of the 
nonmanufacturer rule to, MED procurements.
    (b) Verification of size by SBA. Within 30 days of its receipt of a 
Participant's size self-certification for a particular MED subcontract, 
the SBA district office serving the geographic area in which the 
Participant's principal office is located will review the Participant's 
self-certification and determine if it is small for purposes of that 
subcontract. The SBA district office will review the Participant's most 
recent financial statements and other relevant data and then notify the 
Participant of its decision.
    (c) Changes in size between date of self-certification and date of 
award. (1) Where SBA verifies that the selected Participant is small for 
a particular procurement, subsequent changes in size up to the date of 
award, except those due to merger with or acquisition by another 
business concern, will not affect the firm's size status for that 
procurement.
    (2) Where a Participant has merged with or been acquired by another 
business concern between the date of its self-certification and the date 
of award, the concern must recertify its size status, and SBA must 
verify the new certification before award can occur.
    (d) Finding Participant to be other than small. (1) A Participant 
may request a formal size determination (pursuant to Secs. 121.1001 
through 121.1009) with the SBA Government Contracting Area Office 
serving the geographic area in which the principal office of the 
Participant is located within 5 working days of its receipt of notice 
from the SBA district office that it is not small for a particular MED 
subcontract.

[[Page 215]]

    (2) Where the Participant does not timely request a formal size 
determination, SBA may accept the procurement in support of another 
Participant, or may rescind its acceptance of the offer for the MED 
program, as appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 121.604  Are MED Participants considered small for purposes of other SBA assistance?

    A concern which SBA determines to be a small business for the award 
of a MED subcontract will be considered to have met applicable size 
eligibility requirements of other SBA programs where that assistance 
directly and primarily relates to the performance of the MED subcontract 
in question.

certification as true for the particular funding agreement involved in 
the absence of a written protest by other offerors or other credible 
information which would cause the funding agreement officer or SBA to 
question the size of the concern.
    (c) Procedures for protesting an offeror's self-certification are 
set forth in Secs. 121.1001 through 121.1009.

      Size Eligibility Requirements for Paying Reduced Patent Fees


<R05>
Sec. 121.801  May patent fees be reduced if a concern is small?

    These sections apply to size status for the purpose of paying 
reduced patent fees authorized by Pub. L. 97-247, 96 Stat. 317. The

organizations for the purpose of paying reduced patent fees are set 
forth in regulations of the Patent and

[[Page 216]]

Trademark Office of the Department of Commerce, 37 CFR 1.9, 1.27, 1.28.


<R05>
Sec. 121.802  What size standards are applicable to reduced patent fees programs?

    A concern eligible for reduced patent fees is one:
    (a) Whose number of employees, including affiliates, does not exceed 
500 persons; and
    (b) Which has not assigned, granted, conveyed, or licensed (and is 
under no obligation to do so) any rights in the invention to any person 
who made it and could not be classified as an independent inventor, or 
to any concern which would not qualify as a non-profit organization or a 
small business concern under this section.


<R05>
Sec. 121.803  Are formal size determinations binding on parties?

    Size determinations by authorized SBA officials are formal actions, 
based upon a specific patent application pursuant to the rules of the 
Patent and Trademark Office, Department of Commerce, and are binding 
upon the parties. Other SBA opinions provided to patent applicants or 
others are only advisory, and are not binding or appealable.


<R05>
Sec. 121.804  When does SBA determine the size status of a business concern?

    Size status is determined as of the date of the patent applicant's 
written verification of size.


<R05>
Sec. 121.805  May a business concern self-certify its size status?

    (a) A concern verifies its size status with its submission of its 
patent application.
    (b) Any attempt to establish small size status improperly 
(fraudulently, through gross negligence, or otherwise) may result in 
remedial action by the Patent and Trademark Office.
    (c) In the absence of credible information indicating otherwise, the 
Patent and Trademark Office may accept the verification by the concern 
as a small business as true.
    (d) Questions concerning the size verification are resolved 
initially by the Patent and Trademark Office. If not verified as small, 
the applicant may request a formal SBA size determination.

  Size Eligibility Requirements for Compliance With Programs of Other 
                                Agencies


<R05>
Sec. 121.901  Can other Government agencies obtain SBA size determinations?

    Upon request by another Government agency, SBA will provide a size 
determination, under SBA rules, standards and procedures, for its use in 
determining compliance with small business requirements of its statutes, 
regulations or programs.


<R05>
Sec. 121.902  What size standards are applicable to programs of other agencies?

    (a) SBA size standards. The size standards for compliance with 
programs of other agencies are those for SBA programs which are most 
comparable to the programs of such other agencies, unless otherwise 
agreed by the agency and SBA.
    (b) Special size standards. (1) Federal agencies or departments 
promulgating regulations relating to small businesses usually use SBA 
size criteria. In limited circumstances, if they decide the SBA size 
standard is not appropriate, then agency heads may establish a small 
business definition for the exclusive use of such program which is more 
appropriate, but only when:
    (i) The size standard is first proposed for public comment pursuant 
to the Administrative Procedure Act, 4 U.S.C. 553;
    (ii) The proposed size standard provides for determining size 
measured by average number of employees over 12 months for manufacturing 
concerns, average annual revenues over three years for concerns 
providing services, and data over a period of not less than three years 
for all other concerns (unless approved by SBA, ``annual receipts'' and 
``number of employees'' must be determined in accordance with 
Secs. 121.104 and 121.106, respectively); and
    (iii) The proposed size standard is approved by SBA's Administrator.
    (2) In order to receive the approval of SBA's Administrator, the 
agency head must:

[[Page 217]]

    (i) Request approval prior to publishing the proposed rule 
containing the size standard. The request must include: an explanation 
of the contemplated industry size standard, the reasons the SBA size 
standard is not appropriate, and the reasons the proposed size standard 
would be appropriate; and a certification that there will be compliance 
with the criteria set forth in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (b)(1)(ii) of 
this section; and
    (ii) Agree to provide written notice to SBA's Administrator prior to 
publishing the contemplated size standard as a final rule. The notice 
must include: a copy of the intended final rule, including the preamble, 
or a separate written justification for the intended size standard 
followed by a copy of the intended final rule and preamble prior to its 
publication; copies of all public comments relating to the size standard 
received in response to the proposed rule; and any other supporting 
documentation relevant to the size standard and requested by SBA's 
Administrator.
    (3) When approving any size standard established pursuant to 
subsection (b) of this section, SBA's Administrator will ensure that the 
size standard varies from industry to industry to the extent necessary 
to reflect the differing characteristics of the various industries, and 
consider other relevant factors.
    (4) Where the agency head is developing a size standard for the sole 
purpose of performing a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis pursuant to the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act, the department or agency may, after 
consultation with the SBA Office of Advocacy, establish a size standard 
different from SBA's which is more appropriate for such analysis.


<R05>
Sec. 121.903  When does SBA determine the size status of a business concern?

    For the purpose of compliance with programs of other agencies, SBA 
will base its size determination on the size of the concern as of the 
date set forth in the request of the other agency.

exists between an applicant for financial assistance and one or more 
other entities for purposes of determining whether the applicant would 
exceed the loan limit amount imposed by Sec. 120.151 of this chapter.
    (2) For SBA's 8(a) BD program:
    (i) Concerning initial or continued 8(a) BD eligibility, the 
following entities may request a formal size determination:

[61 FR 3286, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 63 FR 31907, June 11, 1998; 63 
FR 35739, June 30, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 121.1002  Who makes a formal size determination?

    The responsible Government Contracting Area Director or designee 
makes all formal size determinations in response to either a size 
protest or a request for a formal size determination, with the exception 
of size determinations for purposes of the Disaster Loan Program, which 
will be made by the Disaster Area Office Director or designee 
responsible for the area in which the disaster occurred.


<R05>
Sec. 121.1003  Where should a size protest be filed?

    A protest involving a government procurement or sale must be filed 
with the contracting officer for the procurement or sale, who must 
forward the protest to the SBA Government Contracting Area Office 
serving the area in which the headquarters of the protested concern is 
located, regardless of the location of any parent company or affiliates.


<R05>
Sec. 121.1004  What time limits apply to size protests?

    (a) Protests by entities other than contracting officers or SBA. (1) 
Non-negotiated procurement or sale. A protest must be received by the 
contracting officer prior to the close of business on the 5th day, 
exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays, after bid or 
proposal opening.
    (2) Negotiated procurement. A protest must be received by the 
contracting officer prior to the close of business on the 5th day, 
exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays, after the 
contracting officer has notified the protestor of the identity of the 
prospective awardee.
    (3) Multiple award schedule. On a multiple award schedule 
procurement set aside for small business, protests will be considered 
timely if received by SBA at any time prior to the expiration of the 
contract period (including renewals).
    (b) Protests by contracting officers or SBA. The time limitations in 
paragraph (a) of this section do not apply to contracting officers or 
SBA, and they may file protests before or after awards, except to the 
extent set forth in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (c) Effect of contract award. A timely filed protest applies to the 
procurement in question even though a contracting officer awarded the 
contract prior to receipt of the protest.
    (d) Untimely protests. A protest received after the allotted time 
limits must still be forwarded to SBA. SBA will dismiss untimely 
protests.
    (e) Premature protests. A protest filed by any party, including the 
contracting officer, before bid opening or notification to offerors of 
the selection of the apparent successful offer will be dismissed as 
premature.


<R05>
Sec. 121.1005  How must a protest be filed with the contracting officer?

    A protest must be delivered to the contracting officer by hand, 
telegram, mail, FAX, or telephone. If a protest is made by telephone, 
the contracting officer must later receive a confirming letter either 
within the 5-day period in Sec. 121.1004(a)(1) or postmarked no later 
than one day after the date of the telephone protest.


<R05>
Sec. 121.1006  When will a size protest be referred to an SBA Government Contracting Area Office?

    (a) A contracting officer who receives a protest (other than from 
SBA) must forward the protest promptly to the SBA Government Contracting 
Area Office serving the area in which the headquarters of the offeror is 
located.
    (b) A contracting officer's referral must contain the following 
information:

[[Page 220]]

    (1) The protest and any accompanying materials;
    (2) A copy of the self-certification as to size;
    (3) Identification of the applicable size standard;
    (4) A copy of the solicitation;
    (5) Identification of the date of bid opening or notification 
provided to unsuccessful offerors;
    (6) The date on which the protest was received; and
    (7) A complete address and point of contact for the protested 
concern.


<R05>
Sec. 121.1007  Must a protest of size status relate to a particular procurement and be specific?

    (a) Particular procurement. A protest challenging the size of a 
concern which does not pertain to a particular procurement or sale will 
not be acted on by SBA.
    (b) A protest must include specific facts. A protest must be 
sufficiently specific to provide reasonable notice as to the grounds 
upon which the protested concern's size is questioned. Some basis for 
the belief or allegation stated in the protest must be given. A protest 
merely alleging that the protested concern is not small or is affiliated 
with unnamed other concerns does not specify adequate grounds for the 
protest. No particular form is prescribed for a protest. Where materials 
supporting the protest are available, they should be submitted with the 
protest.
    (c) Non-specific protests will be dismissed. Protests which do not 
contain sufficient specificity will be dismissed by SBA.


<R05>
Sec. 121.1008  What happens after SBA receives a size protest or a request for a formal size determination?

    (a) When a size protest is received, the SBA Government Contracting 
Area Director, or designee, will promptly notify the contracting 
officer, the protested concern, and the protestor that a protest has 
been received. In the event the size protest pertains to a requirement 
involving SBA's HUBZone Program, the Government Contracting Area 
Director will advise the AA/HUB of receipt of the protest. In the event 
the size protest pertains to a requirement involving SBA's SBIR Program, 
the Government Contracting Area Director will advise the Assistant 
Administrator for Technology of the receipt of the protest. SBA will 
provide a copy of the protest to the protested concern along with a 
blank SBA Application for Small Business Size Determination (SBA Form 
355) by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by any overnight 
delivery service that provides proof of receipt. SBA will ask the 
protested concern to respond to the allegations of the protestor.
    (b) When SBA receives a request for a formal size determination in 
accord with Sec. 121.1001(b), SBA will provide a blank copy of SBA Form 
355 to the concern whose size is at issue.
    (c) The protested concern or concern whose size is at issue must 
return the completed SBA Form 355 and all other requested information to 
SBA within 3 working days from the date of receipt of the blank form 
from SBA. SBA has discretion to grant an extension of time to file the 
form. The firm must attach to the completed SBA Form 355 its answers to 
the allegations contained in the protest, where applicable, together 
with any supporting material.
    (d) If a concern does not submit a completed SBA Form 355, answers 
to the protest allegations, or other requested information within the 
allotted time provided by SBA, or if it submits incomplete information, 
SBA may presume that disclosure of the form, any information missing 
from it, or other missing information would show or tend to show that 
the concern is other than a small business.

[61 FR 3286, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 63 FR 31908, June 11, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 121.1009  What are the procedures for making the size determination?

    (a) Time frame for making size determination. After receipt of a 
protest or a request for a formal size determination, SBA will make a 
formal size determination within 10 working days, if possible.
    (b) Basis for determination. The size determination will be based 
primarily on information supplied by the protestor or the entity 
requesting the size determination and the subject concern. The 
determination, however, may also be based on other grounds not

[[Page 221]]

raised in the protest or request for size determination. SBA may utilize 
other information in its files and may make inquiries including requests 
to the protestor, the protested concern and any alleged affiliates, or 
other persons for additional specific information.
    (c) Burden of persuasion. The concern whose size is under 
consideration has the burden of establishing its small business size.
    (d) Weight of evidence. SBA will give greater weight to specific, 
signed, factual evidence than to general, unsupported allegations or 
opinions. In the case of refusal or failure to furnish requested 
information within a required time period, SBA may assume that 
disclosure would be contrary to the interests of the party failing to 
make disclosure.
    (e) Formal size determination. The SBA will base its formal size 
determination upon the record, including reasonable inferences from the 
record, and will state in writing the basis for its findings and 
conclusions.
    (f) Notification of determination. SBA will promptly notify the 
contracting officer, the protestor, and the protested offeror, as well 
as each affiliate or alleged affiliate, of the size determination. The 
notification will be by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by 
any overnight delivery service that provides proof of receipt.
    (g) Results of an SBA size determination. (1) A formal size 
determination becomes effective immediately and remains in full force 
and effect unless and until reversed by OHA.
    (2) Once SBA has determined that a concern is other than small for 
purposes of a particular procurement, the concern cannot later become 
eligible for the procurement by reducing its size.
    (3) A concern determined to be other than small for a particular 
size standard is ineligible for any procurement or assistance authorized 
by the Small Business Act or the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, 
requiring the same or a lower size standard, unless recertified as small 
pursuant to Sec. 121.1010. Following an adverse size determination, a 
concern cannot again self-certify as small within the same or a lower 
size standard unless it is recertified as small by SBA. If it does so, 
it may be in violation of criminal laws, including section 16(d) of the 
Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 645(d). If the concern has already 
certified itself as small on a pending procurement or on another 
assistance application, the concern must immediately inform the 
officials responsible for the pending procurement or other requested 
assistance of the adverse size determination.
    (h) Limited reopening of size determinations. In cases where the 
size determination contains clear administrative error or a clear 
mistake of fact, SBA may, in its sole discretion, reopen the size 
determination to correct the error or mistake, provided the case has not 
been accepted for review by OHA.


<R05>
Sec. 121.1010  How does a concern become recertified as a small business?

    (a) A concern may request SBA to recertify it as small at any time 
by filing an application for recertification with the Government 
Contracting Area Office responsible for the area in which the 
headquarters of the applicant is located, regardless of the location of 
parent companies or affiliates. No particular form is prescribed for the 
application; however, the request for recertification must be 
accompanied by a current completed SBA Form 355 and any other 
information sufficient to show a significant change in its ownership, 
management, or other factors bearing on its status as a small concern.
    (b) Recertification will not be required nor will the prohibition 
against future self-certification apply if the adverse SBA size 
determination is based solely on a finding of affiliation due to a joint 
venture (e.g., ostensible subcontracting) limited to a particular 
Government procurement or property sale, or is based on an ineligible 
manufacturer where the eligible small business bidder or offeror is a 
nonmanufacturer on a particular Government procurement.
    (c) A denial of an application for recertification is a formal size 
determination and may be reviewed by OHA at the discretion of that 
office.
    (d) The granting of an application for recertification has future 
effect only. While it is a formal size determination,

[[Page 222]]

notice of recertification is required to be given only to the applicant.

        Appeals of Size Determinations and SIC Code Designations


<R05>
Sec. 121.1101  Are formal size determinations subject to appeal?

    There is no right of appeal of a size determination. OHA, however, 
may, in its sole discretion, review a formal size determination made by 
a SBA Government Contracting Area Office or by a Disaster Area Office. 
Unless OHA accepts a petition for review of a formal size determination, 
the size determination made by a SBA Government Contracting Area Office 
or by a Disaster Area Office is the final decision of SBA. The 
procedures for requesting discretionary reviews by OHA of formal size 
determinations are set forth in part 134 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 121.1102  Are SIC code designations subject to appeal?

    Appeals may be made to OHA, which has exclusive jurisdiction to 
determine appeals of SIC code designations pursuant to part 134 of this 
chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 121.1103  What are the procedures for appealing a SIC code designation?

    (a) Generally, any interested party who has been adversely affected 
by a SIC code designation may appeal the designation to OHA. However, 
with respect to a particular sole source 8(a) contract, only the 
Associate Administrator for 8(a)BD may appeal.
    (b) Procedures for perfecting SIC code appeals with OHA are 
contained in Sec. 19.303 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations, 48 CFR 
19.303.

                 Subpart B--Other Applicable Provisions

    Waivers of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Classes of Products and 
                          Individual Contracts


<R05>
Sec. 121.1201  What is the Nonmanufacturer Rule?

    The Nonmanufacturer Rule is set forth in Sec. 121.406(b).


<R05>
Sec. 121.1202  When will a waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule be granted for a class of products?

    (a) A waiver for a class of products (class waiver) will be granted 
when there are no small business manufacturers or processors available 
to participate in the Federal market for that class of products.
    (b) Federal market means acquisitions by the Federal Government from 
offerors located in the United States, or such smaller area as SBA 
designates if it concludes that the class of products is not supplied on 
a national basis.
    (1) When considering the appropriate market area for a product, SBA 
presumes that the entire United States is the relevant Federal market, 
unless it is clearly demonstrated that a class of products cannot be 
procured on a national basis. This presumption may be particularly 
difficult to overcome in the case of manufactured products, since such 
items typically have a market area encompassing the entire United 
States.
    (2) When considering geographic segmentation of a Federal market, 
SBA will not necessarily use market definitions dependent on airline 
radius, political, or SBA regional boundaries. Market areas typically 
follow established transportation routes rather than jurisdictional 
borders. SBA examines the following factors, among others, in cases 
where geographic segmentation for a class of products is urged:
    (i) Whether perishability affects the area in which the product can 
practically be sold;
    (ii) Whether transportation costs are high as a proportion of the 
total value of the product so as to limit the economic distribution of 
the product;
    (iii) Whether there are legal barriers to transportation of the 
item;
    (iv) Whether a fixed, well-delineated boundary exists for the 
purported market area and whether this boundary has been stable over 
time; and
    (v) Whether a small business, not currently selling in the defined 
market area, could potentially enter the market from another area and 
supply the market at a reasonable price.
    (c) Available to participate in the context of the Federal market 
means that

[[Page 223]]

contractors exist that have been awarded or have performed a contract to 
supply a specific class of products to the Federal Government within 24 
months from the date of the request for waiver, either directly or 
through a dealer, or who have submitted an offer on a solicitation for 
that class of products within that time frame.
    (d) Class of products is an individual subdivision within a four-
digit Industry Number as established by the Office of Management and 
Budget in the SIC Manual.


<R05>
Sec. 121.1203  When will a waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule be granted for an individual contract?

    An individual waiver for a product in a specific solicitation will 
be approved when the SBA Associate Administrator for Government 
Contracting reviews and accepts a contracting officer's determination 
that no small business manufacturer or processor can reasonably be 
expected to offer a product meeting the specifications of a 
solicitation, including the period of performance.


<R05>
Sec. 121.1204  What are the procedures for requesting and granting waivers?

    (a) Waivers for classes of products. (1) SBA may, at its own 
initiative, examine a class of products for possible waiver of the 
Nonmanufacturer Rule.
    (2) Any interested person, business, association, or Federal agency 
may submit a request for a waiver for a particular class of products. 
Requests should be addressed or hand-carried to the Associate 
Administrator of Government Contracting, Small Business Administration, 
409 3rd Street SW., Washington, DC 20416.
    (3) Requests for a waiver of a class of products need not be in any 
particular form, but should include a statement of the class of products 
to be waived, the applicable SIC code, and detailed information on the 
efforts made to identify small business manufacturers or processors for 
the class.
    (4) If SBA decides that there are small business manufacturers or 
processors in the Federal procurement market, it will deny the request 
for waiver, issue notice of the denial, and provide the names, 
addresses, and telephone numbers of the sources found. If SBA does not 
initially confirm the existence of small business manufacturers or 
processors in the Federal market, it will:
    (i) Publish notices in the Commerce Business Daily and the Federal 
Register seeking information on small business manufacturers or 
processors, announcing a notice of intent to waive the Nonmanufacturer 
Rule for that class of products and affording the public a 15-day 
comment period; and
    (ii) If no small business sources are identified, publish a notice 
in the Federal Register stating that no small business sources were 
found and that a waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for that class of 
products has been granted.
    (5) An expedited procedure for issuing a class waiver may be used 
for emergency situations, but only if the contracting officer provides a 
determination to the Associate Administrator for Government Contracting 
that the procurement is proceeding under the authority of FAR 
Sec. 6.302-2 (48 CFR 6.302-2) for ``unusual and compelling urgency,'' or 
provides a determination materially the same as one of unusual and 
compelling urgency. Under the expedited procedure, if a small business 
manufacturer or processor is not identified by a PASS search, the SBA 
will grant the waiver for the class of products and then publish a 
notice in the Federal Register. The notice will state that a waiver has 
been granted, and solicit public comment for future procurements.
    (6) The decision by the Associate Administrator for Government 
Contracting to grant or deny a waiver is the final decision by the 
Agency.
    (7) A waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for classes of products has 
no specific time limitation. SBA will, however, periodically review 
existing class waivers to the Nonmanufacturer Rule to determine if small 
business manufacturers or processors have become available to 
participate in the Federal market for the waived classes of products and 
the waiver should be terminated.
    (i) Upon SBA's receipt of evidence that a small business 
manufacturer or processor exists in the Federal market

[[Page 224]]

for a waived class of products, the waiver will be terminated by the 
Associate Administrator for Government Contracting. This evidence may be 
discovered by SBA during a periodic review of existing waivers or may be 
brought to SBA's attention by other sources.
    (ii) SBA will announce its intent to terminate a waiver for a class 
of products through the publication of a notice in the Federal Register, 
asking for comments regarding the proposed termination.
    (iii) Unless public comment reveals that no small business 
manufacturer or processor in fact exists for the class of products in 
question, SBA will publish a final Notice of Termination in the Federal 
Register.
    (b) Individual waivers for specific solicitations. (1) A contracting 
officer's request for a waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for specific 
solicitations need not be in any particular form, but must, at a 
minimum, include:
    (i) A definitive statement of the specific item to be waived and 
justification as to why the specific item is required;
    (ii) The solicitation number, SIC code, dollar amount of the 
procurement, and a brief statement of the procurement history;
    (iii) A determination by the contracting officer that there are no 
known small business manufacturers or processors for the requested items 
(the determination must contain a narrative statement of the contracting 
officer's efforts to search for small business manufacturers or 
processors of the item and the results of those efforts, and a statement 
by the contracting officer that there are no known small business 
manufacturers for the items and that no small business manufacturer or 
processor can reasonably be expected to offer the required items); and
    (iv) For contracts expected to exceed $500,000, a copy of the 
Statement of Work.
    (2) Requests should be addressed to the Associate Administrator for 
Government Contracting, Small Business Administration, 409 3rd Street, 
SW., Washington, DC 20416.
    (3) SBA will examine the contracting officer's determination and any 
other information it deems necessary to make an informed decision on the 
individual waiver request. If SBA's research verifies that no small 
business manufacturers or processors exist for the item, the Associate 
Administrator for Government Contracting will grant an individual, one-
time waiver. If a small business manufacturer or processor is found for 
the product in question, the Associate Administrator will deny the 
request. Either decision represents a final decision by SBA.


<R05>
Sec. 121.1205  How is a list of previously granted class waivers obtained?

    A list of classes of products for which waivers of the 
Nonmanufacturer Rule have been granted will be maintained in SBA's 
Procurement Automated Source System (PASS). A list of such waivers may 
also be obtained by contacting the Office of Government Contracting at 
the Small Business Administration, 409 3rd Street, SW., Washington, DC 
20416, or at the nearest SBA Government Contracting Area Office.

                                Overview


<R05>
Sec. 123.1  What do these rules cover?

    This part covers the disaster loan programs authorized under the 
Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 636(b), (c), and (f). Since SBA cannot 
predict the occurrence or magnitude of disasters, it reserves the right 
to change the rules in this part, without advance notice, by publishing 
interim emergency regulations in the Federal Register.


<R05>
Sec. 123.2  What are disaster loans and disaster declarations?

    SBA offers low interest, fixed rate loans to disaster victims, 
enabling them to repair or replace property damaged or destroyed in 
declared disasters. It also offers such loans to affected small 
businesses to help them recover from economic injury caused by such 
disasters. Disaster declarations are official notices recognizing that 
specific geographic areas have been damaged by floods and other acts of 
nature, riots, civil disorders, or industrial accidents such as oil 
spills. These disasters are sudden events which cause severe physical 
damage, and do not include slower physical occurrences such as shoreline 
erosion or gradual land settling. Sudden physical events that cause 
substantial economic injury may be disasters even if they do not cause 
physical damage to a victim's property. Past examples include ocean 
conditions causing significant displacement (major ocean currents) or 
closure (toxic algae blooms) of customary fishing waters, as well as 
contamination of food or other products for human consumption from 
unforeseeable and unintended events beyond the control of the victims.


<R05>
Sec. 123.3  How are disaster declarations made?

    (a) There are four ways in which disaster declarations are issued 
which make SBA disaster loans possible:
    (1) The President declares a Major Disaster and authorizes Federal 
assistance, including individual assistance (temporary housing and 
Individual and Family Grant Assistance).
    (2) SBA makes a physical disaster declaration, based on the 
occurrence of at least a minimum amount of physical damage to buildings, 
machinery, equipment, inventory, homes and other property. Such damage 
usually must meet the following tests:
    (i) In any county or other smaller political subdivision of a State 
or U.S. possession, at least 25 homes or 25 businesses, or a combination 
of at least 25 homes, businesses, or other eligible institutions, each 
sustain uninsured losses of 40 percent or more of the estimated fair 
replacement value or pre-

[[Page 226]]

disaster fair market value of the damaged property, whichever is lower; 
or
    (ii) In any such political subdivision, at least three businesses 
each sustain uninsured losses of 40 percent or more of the estimated 
fair replacement value or pre-disaster fair market value of the damaged 
property, whichever is lower, and, as a direct result of such physical 
damage, 25 percent or more of the work force in their community would be 
unemployed for at least 90 days; and
    (iii) The Governor of the State in which the disaster occurred 
submits a written request to SBA for a physical disaster declaration by 
SBA (OMB Approval No. 3245-0121). This request should be delivered to 
the SBA Disaster Area Office serving the region where the disaster 
occurred within 60 days of the date of the disaster.
    (3) SBA makes an economic injury disaster declaration in response to 
a determination of a natural disaster by the Secretary of Agriculture.
    (4) SBA makes an economic injury declaration in reliance on a state 
certification that at least 5 small business concerns in a disaster area 
have suffered substantial economic injury as a result of the disaster 
and are in need of financial assistance not otherwise available on 
reasonable terms. The state certification must be signed by the 
Governor, must specify the county or counties or other political 
subdivisions in which the disaster occurred, and must be delivered (with 
supporting documentation) to the servicing SBA Disaster Area Office 
within 120 days of the disaster occurrence.
    (b) SBA publishes notice of any disaster declaration in the Federal 
Register. The published notice will identify the kinds of assistance 
available, the date and nature of the disaster, and the deadline and 
location for filing loan applications. Additionally, SBA will use the 
local media to inform potential loan applicants where to obtain loan 
applications and otherwise to assist victims in applying for disaster 
loans. SBA will accept applications after the announced deadline only 
when SBA determines that the late filing resulted from substantial 
causes beyond the control of the applicant.


<R05>
Sec. 123.4  What is a disaster area and why is it important?

    Each disaster declaration defines the geographical areas affected by 
the disaster. Only those victims located in the declared disaster area 
are eligible to apply for SBA disaster loans. When the President 
declares a major disaster, the Federal Emergency Management Agency 
defines the disaster area. In major disasters, economic injury disaster 
loans may be made for victims in contiguous counties or other political 
subdivisions. Disaster declarations issued by the Administrator of SBA 
include contiguous counties for both physical and economic injury 
assistance. Contiguous counties or other political subdivisions are 
those land areas which abut the land area of the declared disaster area 
without geographic separation other than by a minor body of water, not 
to exceed one mile between the land areas of such counties.


<R05>
Sec. 123.5  What kinds of loans are available?

    SBA offers three kinds of disaster loans: physical disaster home 
loans, physical disaster business loans, and economic injury business 
loans. SBA makes these loans directly or in participation with a 
financial institution. If a loan is made in participation with a 
financial institution, SBA's share in that loan may not exceed 90 
percent.


<R05>
Sec. 123.6  What does SBA look for when considering a disaster loan applicant?

    There must be reasonable assurance that you can repay your loan out 
of your personal or business cash flow, and you must have satisfactory 
credit and character. SBA will not make a loan to you if repayment 
depends upon the sale of collateral through foreclosure or any other 
disposition of assets owned by you. SBA is prohibited by statute from 
making a loan to you if you are engaged in the production or 
distribution of any product or service that has been determined to be 
obscene by a court.


<R05>
Sec. 123.7  Are there restrictions on how disaster loans can be used?

    You must use disaster loans to restore or replace your primary home

[[Page 227]]

(including a mobile home used as a primary residence) and your personal 
or business property as nearly as possible to their condition before the 
disaster occurred, and within certain limits, to protect damaged or 
destroyed real property from possible future similar disasters.


<R05>
Sec. 123.8  Does SBA charge any fees for obtaining a disaster loan?

    SBA does not charge points, closing, or servicing fees on any 
disaster loan. You will be responsible for payment of any closing costs 
owed to third parties, such as recording fees and title insurance 
premiums. If your loan is made in participation with a financial 
institution, SBA will charge a guarantee fee to the financial 
institution, which then may recover the guarantee fee from you.


<R05>
Sec. 123.9  What happens if I don't use loan proceeds for the intended purpose?

    (a) When SBA approves each loan application, it issues a loan 
authorization which specifies the amount of the loan, repayment terms, 
any collateral requirements, and the permitted use of loan proceeds. If 
you wrongfully misapply these proceeds, you will be liable to SBA for 
one and one-half times the proceeds disbursed to you as of the date SBA 
learns of your wrongful misapplication. Wrongful misapplication means 
the willful use of any loan proceeds without SBA approval contrary to 
the loan authorization. If you fail to use loan proceeds for authorized 
purposes for 60 days or more after receiving a loan disbursement check, 
such non-use also is considered a wrongful misapplication of the 
proceeds.
    (b) If SBA learns that you may have misapplied your loan proceeds, 
SBA will notify you at your last known address, by certified mail, 
return receipt requested. You will be given at least 30 days to submit 
to SBA evidence that you have not misapplied the loan proceeds or that 
you have corrected any such misapplication. Any failure to respond in 
time will be considered an admission that you misapplied the proceeds. 
If SBA finds a wrongful misapplication, it will cancel any undisbursed 
loan proceeds, call the loan, and begin collection measures to collect 
your outstanding loan balance and the civil penalty. You may also face 
criminal prosecution or civil or administrative action.


<R05>
Sec. 123.10  What happens if I cannot use my insurance proceeds to make repairs?

    If you must pay insurance proceeds to the holder of a recorded lien 
or encumbrance against your damaged property instead of using them to 
make repairs, you may apply to SBA for the full amount needed to make 
such repairs. If you voluntarily pay insurance proceeds to a recorded 
lienholder, your loan eligibility is reduced by the amount of the 
voluntary payment.


<R05>
Sec. 123.11  Does SBA require collateral for any of its disaster loans?

    Generally, SBA will not require that you pledge collateral to secure 
a disaster home loan or a physical disaster business loan of $10,000 or 
less, or an economic injury disaster loan of $5,000 or less. For loans 
larger than these amounts, you will be required to provide available 
collateral such as a lien on the damaged or replacement property, a 
security interest in personal property, or both.
    (a) Sometimes a borrower, including affiliates as defined in part 
121 of this title, will have more than one loan after a single disaster. 
In deciding whether collateral is required, SBA will add up all physical 
disaster loans to see if they exceed $10,000 and all economic injury 
disaster loans to see if they exceed $5,000.
    (b) SBA will not decline a loan if you lack a particular amount of 
collateral as long as it is reasonably sure that you can repay your 
loan. If you refuse to pledge available collateral when requested by 
SBA, however, SBA may decline or cancel your loan.


<R05>
Sec. 123.12  Are books and records required?

    You must retain complete records of all transactions financed with 
your SBA loan proceeds, including copies of all contracts and receipts, 
for a period of 3 years after you receive your final disbursement of 
loan proceeds. If you

[[Page 228]]

have a physical disaster business or economic injury loan, you must also 
maintain current and accurate books of account, including financial and 
operating statements, insurance policies, and tax returns. You must 
retain applicable books and records for 3 years after your loan matures 
including any extensions, or from the date when your loan is paid in 
full, whichever occurs first. You must make available to SBA or other 
authorized government personnel upon request all such books and records 
for inspection, audit, and reproduction during normal business hours and 
you must also permit SBA and any participating financial institution to 
inspect and appraise your assets. (OMB Approval No. 3245-0110.)


<R05>
Sec. 123.13  What happens if my loan application is denied?

    (a) If SBA denies your loan application, SBA will notify you in 
writing and set forth the specific reasons for the denial. Any applicant 
whose request for a loan is declined for reasons other than size (not 
being a small business) has the right to present information to overcome 
the reason or reasons for the decline and to request reconsideration in 
writing. (OMB Approval No. 3245-0122.)
    (b) Any decline due to size can only be appealed as set forth in 
part 121 of this chapter.
    (c) Any request for reconsideration must be received by the SBA 
office that declined the original application within six months of the 
date of the declined notice. After six months, a new loan application is 
required.
    (d) A request for reconsideration must contain all significant new 
information that you rely on to overcome SBA's denial of your original 
loan application. Your request for reconsideration of a business loan 
application must also be accompanied by current business financial 
statements.
    (e) If SBA declines your application a second time, you have the 
right to appeal in writing to the Area Director's Office. All appeals 
must be received by the office that declined the prior reconsideration 
within 30 days of the decline action. Your request must state that you 
are appealing, and must give specific reasons why the decline action 
should be reversed.
    (f) The decision of the Area Director is final unless:
    (1) The Area Director does not have authority to approve the 
requested loan;
    (2) The Area Director refers the matter to the Associate 
Administrator for Disaster Assistance; or
    (3) The Associate Administrator for Disaster Assistance, upon a 
showing of special circumstances, requests the Area Director's office to 
forward the matter to him or her for final consideration. Special 
circumstances may include, but are not limited to, policy 
considerations, alleged improper acts by SBA personnel or others in 
processing the application, and conflicting policy interpretations 
between two Area Offices.


<R05>
Sec. 123.14  How does the Federal Debt Collection Procedures Act of 1990 apply?

    (a) Under the Federal Debt Collection Procedures Act of 1990 (28 
U.S.C. 3201(e)), a debtor who owns property which is subject to an 
outstanding judgment lien for a debt owed to the United States generally 
is not eligible to receive physical and economic injury disaster loans. 
The SBA Associate Administrator for Disaster Assistance, or designee, 
may waive this restriction as to disaster loans upon a demonstration of 
good cause. Good cause means a written representation by you under oath 
which convinces SBA that:
    (1) The declared disaster was a major contributing factor to the 
delinquency which led to the judgment lien, regardless of when the 
original debt was incurred; or
    (2) The disaster directly prevented you from fulfilling the terms of 
an agreement with SBA or any other Federal Government entity to satisfy 
its pre-disaster judgment lien; in this situation, the judgment creditor 
must certify to SBA that you were complying with the agreement to 
satisfy the judgment lien when the disaster occurred; or
    (3) Other circumstances exist which would justify a waiver.
    (b) The waiver determination by the Associate Administrator for 
Disaster

[[Page 229]]

Assistance, or designee, is a final, non-appealable decision. The 
granting of a waiver does not include loan approval; a waiver recipient 
must then follow normal loan application procedures.


<R05>
Sec. 123.15  What if I change my mind?

    If SBA required you to pledge collateral for your loan, you may 
change your mind and rescind your loan pursuant to the Consumer Credit 
Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. 1601, and Regulation Z of the Federal Reserve 
Board, 12 CFR part 226. Your note and any collateral documents signed by 
you will be canceled upon your return of all loan proceeds and your 
payment of any interest accrued.


<R05>
Sec. 123.16  How are loans administered and serviced?

    (a) If you obtained your disaster loan from a participating lender, 
that lender is responsible for closing and servicing your loan. If you 
obtained your loan directly from SBA, your loan will be closed and 
serviced by SBA. The SBA rules on servicing are found in part 120 of 
this chapter.
    (b) If you are unable to pay your SBA loan installments in a timely 
manner for reasons substantially beyond your control, you may request 
that SBA suspend your loan payments, extend your maturity, or both.


<R05>
Sec. 123.17  Do other Federal requirements apply?

    As a condition of disbursement, you must be in compliance with 
certain requirements relating to flood insurance, lead-based paint, 
earthquake hazards, coastal barrier islands, and child support 
obligations, as set forth in Secs. 120.170 through 120.175 of this 
chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 123.18  Can I request an increase in the amount of a physical disaster loan?

    SBA will consider your request for an increase in your loan if you 
can show that the eligible cost of repair or replacement of damages 
increased because of events occurring after the loan approval that were 
beyond your control. An eligible cost is one which is related to the 
disaster for which SBA issued the original loan. For example, if you 
discover hidden damage within a reasonable time after SBA approved your 
original disaster loan and before repair, renovation, or reconstruction 
is complete, you may request an increase. Or, if applicable building 
code requirements were changed since SBA approved your original loan, 
you may request an increase in your loan amount.

[63 FR 15072, Mar. 30, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 123.19  May I request an increase in the amount of an economic injury loan?

    SBA will consider your request for an increase in the loan amount if 
you can show that the increase is essential for your business to 
continue and is based on events occurring after SBA approved your 
original loan which were beyond your control. For example, delays may 
have occurred beyond your control which prevent you from resuming your 
normal business activity in a reasonable time frame. Your request for an 
increase in the loan amount must be related to the disaster for which 
the SBA economic injury disaster loan was originally made.

[63 FR 15072, Mar. 30, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 123.20  How long do I have to request an increase in the amount of a physical disaster loan or an economic injury loan?

    You should request a loan increase as soon as possible after you 
discover the need for the increase, but not later than two years after 
SBA approved your physical disaster or economic injury loan. After two 
years, the SBA Associate Administrator for Disaster Assistance (AA/DA) 
may waive this limitation after finding extraordinary and unforeseeable 
circumstances.

[63 FR 15073, Mar. 30, 1998]

                           Home Disaster Loans


<R05>
Sec. 123.100  Am I eligible to apply for a home disaster loan?

    (a) You are eligible to apply for a home disaster loan if you:
    (1) Own and occupy your primary residence and have suffered a 
physical loss to your primary residence, personal property, or both; or

[[Page 230]]

    (2) Do not own your primary residence, but have suffered a physical 
loss to your personal property. Family members sharing a residence are 
eligible if they are not dependents of the owners of the residence.
    (b) Losses may be claimed only by the owners of the property at the 
time of the disaster, and all such losses will be verified by SBA. SBA 
will consider beneficial ownership as well as legal title (for real or 
personal property) in determining who suffered the loss.


<R05>
Sec. 123.101  When am I not eligible for a home disaster loan?

    You are not eligible for a home disaster loan if:
    (a) You have been convicted, during the past year, of a felony 
during and in connection with a riot or civil disorder or other declared 
disaster;
    (b) You acquired voluntarily more than a 50 percent ownership 
interest in the damaged property after the disaster, and no contract of 
sale existed at the time of the disaster;
    (c) Your damaged property can be repaired or replaced with the 
proceeds of insurance, gifts or other compensation, including 
condemnation awards (with one exception, these amounts must either be 
deducted from the amount of the claimed losses or, if received after SBA 
has approved and disbursed a loan, must be paid to SBA as principal 
payments on your loan. You must notify SBA of any such recoveries 
collected after receiving an SBA disaster loan (OMB Approval No. 3245-
0124)). The one exception applies to amounts received under the 
Individual and Family Grant Program of the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency solely to meet an emergency need pending processing of an SBA 
loan. In such an event, you must repay the financial assistance with SBA 
loan proceeds if it was used for purposes also eligible for an SBA 
loan);
    (d) SBA determines that you assumed the risk (for example, by not 
maintaining flood insurance as required by an earlier SBA disaster loan 
when the current loss is also due to flood);
    (e) Your damaged property is a secondary home (although if you 
rented the property out before the disaster and the property would not 
constitute a ``residence'' under the provisions of Section 280A of the 
Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 280A), you may be eligible for a 
physical disaster business loan);
    (f) Your damaged property is the type of vehicle normally used for 
recreational purposes, such as motorhomes, aircraft, and boats;
    (g) Your damaged property consists of cash or securities;
    (h) The replacement value of your damaged personal property is 
extraordinarily high and not easily verified, such as the value of 
antiques, artworks, or hobby collections;
    (i) You or other principal owners of the damaged property are 
presently incarcerated, or on probation or parole following conviction 
for a serious criminal offense;
    (j) Your only interest in the damaged property is in the form of a 
security interest, mortgage, or deed of trust;
    (k) The damaged building, including contents, was newly constructed 
or substantially improved on or after February 9, 1989, and (without a 
significant business justification) is located seaward of mean high tide 
or entirely in or over water; or
    (l) You voluntarily decide to relocate outside the business area in 
which the disaster has occurred, and there are no special or unusual 
circumstances leading to your decision (business area means the 
municipality which provides general governmental services to your 
damaged home or, if not located in a municipality, the county or 
equivalent political entity in which your damaged home is located).


<R05>
Sec. 123.102  What circumstances would justify my relocating?

    SBA may approve a loan if you intend to relocate outside the 
business area in which the disaster has occurred if your relocation is 
caused by such special or unusual circumstances as:
    (a) Demonstrable risk that the business area will suffer future 
disasters;
    (b) A change in employment status (such as loss of job, transfer, 
lack of adequate job opportunities within the business area or scheduled 
retirement within 18 months after the disaster occurs);
    (c) Medical reasons; or

[[Page 231]]

    (d) Special family considerations which necessitate a move outside 
of the business area.


<R05>
Sec. 123.103  What happens if I am forced to move from my home?

    If you must relocate inside or outside the business area because 
local authorities will not allow you to repair your damaged property, 
SBA considers this to be a total loss and a mandatory relocation. In 
this case, your loan would be an amount that SBA considers sufficient to 
replace your residence at your new location, plus funds to cover losses 
of personal property and eligible refinancing.


<R05>
Sec. 123.104  What interest rate will I pay on my home disaster loan?

    If you can obtain credit elsewhere, your interest rate is set by a 
statutory formula, but will not exceed 8 percent per annum. If you 
cannot obtain credit elsewhere, your interest rate is one-half the 
statutory rate, but will not exceed 4 percent per annum. Credit 
elsewhere means that, with your cash flow and disposable assets, SBA 
believes you could obtain financing from non-federal sources on 
reasonable terms. If you cannot obtain credit elsewhere, you also may be 
able to borrow from SBA to refinance existing recorded liens against 
your damaged real property. Under prior legislation, some SBA disaster 
loans had split interest rates. On any such loan, repayments of 
principal are applied first to that portion of the loan with the lowest 
interest rate.


<R05>
Sec. 123.105  How much can I borrow with a home disaster loan and what limits apply on use of funds and repayment terms?

    (a) For all disasters occurring on or after October 26, 1993, there 
are limits on how much money you can borrow for particular purposes:
    (1) $40,000 for repair or replacement of household and personal 
effects;
    (2) $200,000 for repair or replacement of a primary residence 
(including upgrading in order to meet minimum standards of safety and 
decency or current building code requirements). Repair or replacement of 
landscaping and/or recreational facilities cannot exceed $5,000;
    (3) $200,000 for eligible refinancing purposes; and
    (4) 20 percent of the loan amount (not including refinancing) up to 
a maximum of $48,000 for mitigation (see Sec. 123.107).
    (b) You may not use loan proceeds to repay any debts on personal 
property, secured or unsecured, unless you incurred those debts as a 
direct result of the disaster.
    (c) SBA determines the loan maturity and repayment terms based on 
your needs and your ability to pay. Generally, you will pay equal 
monthly installments of principal and interest, beginning five months 
from the date of the loan, as shown on the Note securing the loan. SBA 
will consider other payment terms if you have seasonal or fluctuating 
income, and SBA may allow installment payments of varying amounts over 
the first two years of the loan. The maximum maturity for a home 
disaster loan is 30 years. There is no penalty for prepayment of home 
disaster loans.


<R05>
Sec. 123.106  What is eligible refinancing?

    (a) If your home (primary residence) is totally destroyed or 
substantially damaged, and you do not have credit elsewhere, SBA may 
allow you to borrow money to refinance recorded liens or encumbrances on 
your home. Your home is totally destroyed or substantially damaged if it 
has suffered uninsured or otherwise uncompensated damage which, at the 
time of the disaster, is either:
    (1) 40 percent or more of the home's market value or replacement 
cost at the time of the disaster, including land value, whichever is 
less; or
    (2) 50 percent or more of its market value or replacement cost at 
the time of the disaster, not including land value, whichever is less.
    (b) Your home disaster loan for refinancing existing liens or 
encumbrances cannot exceed an amount equal to the lesser of $200,000, or

insurance or other recovery.

Sec. 123.107  What is mitigation?

    Mitigation means specific measures taken by you to protect against 
recurring damage in similar future disasters. Examples include retaining 
walls, sea walls, grading and contouring land, relocating utilities and 
modifying structures. The money that you can borrow for mitigation is 
limited to the lesser of the cost of mitigation, or 20 percent of your 
loan to repair or replace your damaged primary residence and personal 
property. SBA will not accept a request for a loan increase for 
mitigation filed after final disbursement of your original loan unless 
you can show that your request was late because of substantial reasons 
beyond your control.

                    Physical Disaster Business Loans


<R05>
Sec. 123.200  Am I eligible to apply for a physical disaster business loan?

    (a) Almost any business concern or charitable or other non-profit 
entity whose real or tangible personal property is damaged in a declared 
disaster area is eligible to apply for a physical disaster business 
loan. Your business may be a sole proprietorship, partnership, 
corporation, limited liability company, or other legal entity recognized 
under State law. Your business' size (average annual receipts or number 
of employees) is not taken into consideration in determining your 
eligibility for a physical disaster business loan. If your damaged 
business occupied rented space at the time of the disaster, and the 
terms of your business' lease require you to make repairs to your 
business' building, you may have suffered a physical loss and can apply 
for a physical business disaster loan to repair the property. In all 
other cases, the owner of the building is the eligible loan applicant.
    (b) Damaged vehicles, of the type normally used for recreational 
purposes, such as motorhomes, aircraft, and boats, may be repaired or 
replaced with SBA loan proceeds if you can submit evidence that the 
damaged vehicles were used in your business at the time of the disaster.


<R05>
Sec. 123.201  When am I not eligible to apply for a physical disaster business loan?

    (a) You are not eligible for a physical disaster business loan if 
your business is an agricultural enterprise or if you (or any principal 
of the business) fit into any of the categories in Sec. 123.101. 
Agricultural enterprise means a business primarily engaged in the 
production of food and fiber, ranching and raising of livestock, 
aquaculture and all other farming and agriculture-related industries.
    (b) Sometimes a damaged business entity (whether in the form of a 
corporation, limited liability company, partnership, or sole 
proprietorship) is engaged in both agricultural enterprise and a non-
agricultural business venture. If the agricultural enterprise part of 
your business entity has suffered a physical disaster, that enterprise 
is not eligible for SBA physical disaster assistance. If the non-
agricultural business venture of your entity has suffered physical 
disaster damage, that part of your business operation would be eligible 
for SBA physical disaster assistance. If both the agricultural 
enterprise part and the non-agricultural business venture have incurred 
physical disaster damage, only the non-agricultural business venture of 
your business entity would be eligible for SBA physical disaster 
assistance.
    (c) If your business is going to relocate voluntarily outside the 
business area in which the disaster occurred, you are not eligible for a 
physical disaster business loan. If, however, the relocation is due to 
uncontrollable or compelling circumstances, SBA will consider the 
relocation to be involuntary and eligible for a loan. Such circumstances 
may include, but are not limited to:
    (1) The elimination or substantial decrease in the market for your 
products or services, as a consequence of the disaster;
    (2) A change in the demographics of your business area within 18 
months prior to the disaster, or as a result of the disaster, which 
makes it uneconomical to continue operations in your business area;

[[Page 233]]

    (3) A substantial change in your cost of doing business, as a result 
of the disaster, which makes the continuation of your business in the 
business area not economically viable;
    (4) Location of your business in a hazardous area such as a special 
flood hazard area or an earthquake-prone area;
    (5) A change in the public infrastructure in your business area 
which occurred within 18 months or as a result of the disaster that 
would result in substantially increased expenses for your business in 
the business area;
    (6) Your implementation of decisions adopted and at least partially 
implemented within 18 months prior to the disaster to move your business 
out of the business area; and
    (7) Other factors which undermine the economic viability of your 
business area.
    (d) You are not eligible if your business is engaged in any illegal 
activity.
    (e) You are not eligible if you are a government owned entity 
(except for a business owned or controlled by a Native American tribe).
    (f) You are not eligible if your business presents live performances 
of a prurient sexual nature or derives directly or indirectly more than 
de minimis gross revenue through the sale of products or services, or 
the presentation of any depictions or displays, of a prurient sexual 
nature.

FR 46644, Sept. 2, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 123.202  How much can my business borrow with a physical disaster business loan?

    (a) Disaster business loans, including both physical disaster and 
economic injury loans to the same borrower, together with its 
affiliates, cannot exceed the lesser of the uncompensated physical loss 
and economic injury or $1.5 million. Physical disaster loans may include 
amounts to meet current building code requirements. If your business is 
a major source of employment, SBA may waive the $1.5 million limitation. 
A major source of employment is a business concern which has one or more 
locations in the disaster area which:
    (1) Employed 10 percent or more of the entire work force within the 
commuting area of a geographically identifiable community (no larger 
than a county), provided that the commuting area does not extend more 
than 50 miles from such community; or
    (2) Employed 5 percent of the work force in an industry within the 
disaster area and, if the concern is a non-manufacturing concern, 
employed no less than 50 employees in the disaster area, or if the 
concern is a manufacturing concern, employed no less than 150 employees 
in the disaster area; or
    (3) Employed no less than 250 employees within the disaster area.
    (b) SBA will consider waiving the $1.5 million loan limit only if:
    (1) Your damaged location or locations are out of business or in 
imminent danger of going out of business as a result of the disaster, 
and a loan in excess of $1.5 million is necessary to reopen or keep open 
the damaged locations in order to avoid substantial unemployment in the 
disaster area; and
    (2) You have used all reasonably available funds from your business, 
its affiliates and its principal owners (20% or greater ownership 
interest) and all available credit elsewhere (as described in 
Sec. 123.104) to alleviate your physical damage and economic injury.
    (c) Physical disaster business borrowers may request refinancing of 
liens on both damaged real property and machinery and equipment, but for 
an amount reduced by insurance or other compensation. To do so, your 
business property must be totally destroyed or substantially damaged, 
which means:
    (1) 40 percent or more of the aggregate value (lesser of market 
value or replacement cost at the time of the disaster) of the damaged 
real property (including land) and damaged machinery and equipment; or
    (2) 50 percent or more of the aggregate value (lesser of market 
value or replacement cost at the time of the disaster) of the damaged 
real property (excluding land) and damaged machinery and equipment.
    (d) Loan funds allocated for repair or replacement of landscaping or 
recreational facilities may not exceed

[[Page 234]]

$5,000 unless the landscaping or recreational facilities fulfilled a 
functional need or contributed to the generation of business.

[61 FR 3304, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 63 FR 46644, Sept. 2, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 123.203  What interest rate will my business pay on a physical disaster business loan and what are the repayment terms?

    (a) SBA will announce interest rates with each disaster declaration. 
If your business, together with its affiliates and principal owners, 
have credit elsewhere, your interest rate is set by a statutory formula, 
but will not exceed 8 percent per annum. If you do not have credit 
elsewhere, your interest rate will not exceed 4 percent per annum. The 
maturity of your loan depends upon your repayment ability, but cannot 
exceed 3 years if you have credit elsewhere. Otherwise, the maximum 
maturity is 30 years.
    (b) Generally, you must pay equal monthly installments, of principal 
and interest, beginning five months from the date of the loan as shown 
on the Note. SBA will consider other payment terms if you have seasonal 
or fluctuating income, and SBA may allow installment payments of varying 
amounts over the first two years of the loan. There is no penalty for 
prepayment for disaster loans.

                     Economic Injury Disaster Loans


<R05>
Sec. 123.300  Is my business eligible to apply for an economic injury disaster loan?

    (a) If your business is located in a declared disaster area, and 
suffered substantial economic injury as a direct result of a declared 
disaster, you are eligible to apply for an economic injury disaster 
loan.
    (1) Substantial economic injury is such that a business concern is 
unable to meet its obligations as they mature or to pay its ordinary and 
necessary operating expenses.
    (2) Loss of anticipated profits or a drop in sales is not considered 
substantial economic injury for this purpose.
    (b) Economic injury disaster loans are available only if you were a 
small business (as defined in part 121 of this chapter) when the 
declared disaster commenced, you and your affiliates and principal 
owners (20% or more ownership interest) have used all reasonably 
available funds, and you are unable to obtain credit elsewhere (see 
Sec. 123.104).
    (c) Eligible businesses do not include agricultural enterprises, but 
do include--
    (1) Small nurseries affected by a drought disaster designated by the 
Secretary of Agriculture (nurseries are commercial establishments 
deriving 50 percent or more of their annual receipts from the production 
and sale of ornamental plants and other nursery products, including, but 
not limited to, bulbs, florist greens, foliage, flowers, flower and 
vegetable seeds, shrubbery, and sod);
    (2) Small agricultural cooperatives; and
    (3) Producer cooperatives.


<R05>
Sec. 123.301  When would my business not be eligible to apply for an economic injury disaster loan?

    Your business is not eligible for an economic disaster loan if you 
(or any principal of the business) fit into any of the categories in 
Secs. 123.101 and 123.201, or if your business is:
    (a) Engaged in lending, multi-level sales distribution, speculation, 
or investment (except for real estate investment with property held for 
rental when the disaster occurred);
    (b) A non-profit or charitable concern;
    (c) A consumer or marketing cooperative;
    (d) Not a small business concern; or
    (e) Deriving more than one-third of gross annual revenue from legal 
gambling activities;
    (f) A loan packager which earns more than one-third of its gross 
annual revenue from packaging SBA loans;
    (g) Principally engaged in teaching, instructing, counseling, or 
indoctrinating religion or religious beliefs, whether in a religious or 
secular setting; or
    (h) Primarily engaged in political or lobbying activities.

<R05>
Sec. 123.302  What is the interest rate on an economic injury disaster loan?

    Your economic injury loan will have an interest rate of 4 percent 
per annum or less.


<R05>
Sec. 123.303  How can my business spend my economic injury disaster loan?

    (a) You can only use the loan proceeds for working capital necessary 
to carry your concern until resumption of normal operations and for 
expenditures necessary to alleviate the specific economic injury, but 
not to exceed that which the business could have provided had the injury 
not occurred.
    (b) Loan proceeds may not be used to:
    (1) Refinance indebtedness which you incurred prior to the disaster 
event;
    (2) Make payments on loans owned by another federal agency 
(including SBA) or a Small Business Investment Company licensed under 
the Small Business Investment Act;
    (3) Pay, directly or indirectly, any obligations resulting from a 
federal, state or local tax penalty as a result of negligence or fraud, 
or any non-tax criminal fine, civil fine, or penalty for non-compliance 
with a law, regulation, or order of a federal, state, regional, or local 
agency or similar matter;
    (4) Repair physical damage; or
    (5) Pay dividends or other disbursements to owners, partners, 
officers or stockholders, except for reasonable remuneration directly 
related to their performance of services for the business.

The Participant must maintain its program eligibility during its tenure 
in the program and must inform SBA of any changes that would adversely 
affect its program eligibility. A firm that completes its nine year term 
of participation in the 8(a) BD program is deemed to graduate from the

individuals who manage the concern's day-to-day operations spend most

principal place of business for program purposes.
    Program year means a 12-month period of an 8(a) BD Participant's 
program participation. The first program year begins on the date that 
the concern is certified to participate in the 8(a) BD program and ends 
one year later. Each subsequent program year begins on the Participant's 
anniversary of program certification and runs for one 12-month period.
    Same or similar line of business means business activities within 
the same two-digit ``Major Group'' of the SIC Manual as the primary 
industry classification of the applicant or Participant. The phrase 
``same business area'' is synonymous with this definition.
    Self-marketing of a requirement occurs when a Participant identifies 
a requirement that has not been committed to the 8(a) BD program and, 
through its marketing efforts, causes the procuring activity to offer 
that specific requirement to the 8(a) BD program on the Participant's 
behalf. A firm which identifies and markets a requirement which is 
subsequently offered to the 8(a) BD program as an open requirement or on 
behalf of another Participant has not ``self-marketed'' the requirement 
within the meaning of this part.
    Tribally-owned concern means any concern at least 51 percent owned 
by an Indian tribe as defined in this section.
    Unconditional ownership means ownership that is not subject to 
conditions precedent, conditions subsequent, executory agreements, 
voting trusts, restrictions on or assignments of voting rights, or other 
arrangements causing or potentially causing ownership benefits to go to 
another (other than after death or incapacity). The pledge or 
encumbrance of stock or other ownership interest as collateral, 
including seller-financed transactions, does not affect the 
unconditional nature of ownership if the terms follow normal commercial 
practices and the owner retains control absent violations of the terms.

<R05>
Sec. 124.101  What are the basic requirements a concern must meet for the 8(a) BD program?

    Generally, a concern meets the basic requirements for admission to 
the 8(a) BD program if it is a small business which is unconditionally 
owned and controlled by one or more socially and economically 
disadvantaged individuals who are of good character and citizens of the 
United States, and which demonstrates potential for success.


<R05>
Sec. 124.102  What size business is eligible to participate in the 8(a) BD program?

    (a) An applicant concern must qualify as a small business concern as 
defined in part 121 of this title. The applicable size standard is the 
one for its primary industry classification. The rules for calculating 
the size of a tribally-owned concern, a concern owned by an Alaska 
Native Corporation, a

[[Page 239]]

concern owned by a Native Hawaiian Organization, or a concern owned by a 
Community Development Corporation are additionally affected by 
Secs. 124.109, 124.110, and 124.111, respectively.
    (b) If 8(a) BD program officials determine that a concern may not 
qualify as small, they may deny an application for 8(a) BD program 
admission or may request a formal size determination under part 121 of 
this title.
    (c) A concern whose application is denied due to size by 8(a) BD 
program officials may request a formal size determination under part 121 
of this title. A favorable determination will enable the firm to 
immediately submit a new 8(a) BD application without waiting one year.


<R05>
Sec. 124.103  Who is socially disadvantaged?

    (a) General. Socially disadvantaged individuals are those who have 
been subjected to racial or ethnic prejudice or cultural bias within 
American society because of their identities as members of groups and 
without regard to their individual qualities. The social disadvantage 
must stem from circumstances beyond their control.
    (b) Members of designated groups. (1) There is a rebuttable 
presumption that the following individuals are socially disadvantaged: 
Black Americans; Hispanic Americans; Native Americans (American Indians, 
Eskimos, Aleuts, or Native Hawaiians); Asian Pacific Americans (persons 
with origins from Burma, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, 
Brunei, Japan, China (including Hong Kong), Taiwan, Laos, Cambodia 
(Kampuchea), Vietnam, Korea, The Philippines, U.S. Trust Territory of 
the Pacific Islands (Republic of Palau), Republic of the Marshall 
Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, the Commonwealth of the 
Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, Samoa, Macao, Fiji, Tonga, Kiribati, 
Tuvalu, or Nauru); Subcontinent Asian Americans (persons with origins 
from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, the Maldives 
Islands or Nepal); and members of other groups designated from time to 
time by SBA according to procedures set forth at paragraph (d) of this 
section. Being born in a country does not, by itself, suffice to make 
the birth country an individual's country of origin for purposes of 
being included within a designated group.
    (2) An individual must demonstrate that he or she has held himself 
or herself out, and is currently identified by others, as a member of a 
designated group if SBA requires it.
    (3) The presumption of social disadvantage may be overcome with 
credible evidence to the contrary. Individuals possessing or knowing of 
such evidence should submit the information in writing to the Associate 
Administrator for 8(a) BD (AA/8(a)BD) for consideration.
    (c) Individuals not members of designated groups. (1) An individual 
who is not a member of one of the groups presumed to be socially 
disadvantaged in paragraph (b)(1) of this section must establish 
individual social disadvantage by a preponderance of the evidence.
    (2) Evidence of individual social disadvantage must include the 
following elements:
    (i) At least one objective distinguishing feature that has 
contributed to social disadvantage, such as race, ethnic origin, gender, 
physical handicap, long-term residence in an environment isolated from 
the mainstream of American society, or other similar causes not common 
to individuals who are not socially disadvantaged;
    (ii) Personal experiences of substantial and chronic social 
disadvantage in American society, not in other countries; and
    (iii) Negative impact on entry into or advancement in the business 
world because of the disadvantage. SBA will consider any relevant 
evidence in assessing this element. In every case, however, SBA will 
consider education, employment and business history, where applicable, 
to see if the totality of circumstances shows disadvantage in entering 
into or advancing in the business world.
    (A) Education. SBA considers such factors as denial of equal access 
to institutions of higher education, exclusion from social and 
professional association with students or teachers, denial of 
educational honors rightfully earned, and social patterns or pressures 
which discouraged the individual from

[[Page 240]]

pursuing a professional or business education.
    (B) Employment. SBA considers such factors as unequal treatment in 
hiring, promotions and other aspects of professional advancement, pay 
and fringe benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment; 
retaliatory or discriminatory behavior by an employer; and social 
patterns or pressures which have channelled the individual into 
nonprofessional or non-business fields.
    (C) Business history. SBA considers such factors as unequal access 
to credit or capital, acquisition of credit or capital under 
commercially unfavorable circumstances, unequal treatment in 
opportunities for government contracts or other work, unequal treatment 
by potential customers and business associates, and exclusion from 
business or professional organizations.
    (d) Socially disadvantaged group inclusion. (1) General. 
Representatives of an identifiable group whose members believe that the 
group has suffered chronic racial or ethnic prejudice or cultural bias 
may petition SBA to be included as a presumptively socially 
disadvantaged group under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Upon 
presentation of substantial evidence that members of the group have been 
subjected to racial or ethnic prejudice or cultural bias because of 
their identity as group members and without regard to their individual 
qualities, SBA will publish a notice in the Federal Register that it has 
received and is considering such a request, and that it will consider 
public comments.
    (2) Standards to be applied. In determining whether a group has made 
an adequate showing that it has suffered chronic racial or ethnic 
prejudice or cultural bias for the purposes of this section, SBA must 
determine that:
    (i) The group has suffered prejudice, bias, or discriminatory 
practices;
    (ii) Those conditions have resulted in economic deprivation for the 
group of the type which Congress has found exists for the groups named 
in the Small Business Act; and
    (iii) Those conditions have produced impediments in the business 
world for members of the group over which they have no control and which 
are not common to small business owners generally.
    (3) Procedure. The notice published under paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section will authorize a specified period for the receipt of public 
comments supporting or opposing the petition for socially disadvantaged 
group status. If appropriate, SBA may hold hearings. SBA may also 
conduct its own research relative to the group's petition.
    (4) Decision. In making a final decision that a group should be 
considered presumptively disadvantaged, SBA must find that a 
preponderance of the evidence demonstrates that the group has met the 
standards set forth in paragraph (d)(2) of this section based on SBA's 
consideration of the group petition, the comments from the public, and 
any independent research it performs. SBA will advise the petitioners of 
its final decision in writing, and publish its conclusion as a notice in 
the Federal Register. If appropriate, SBA will amend paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section to include a new group.


<R05>
Sec. 124.104  Who is economically disadvantaged?

    (a) General. Economically disadvantaged individuals are socially 
disadvantaged individuals whose ability to compete in the free 
enterprise system has been impaired due to diminished capital and credit 
opportunities as compared to others in the same or similar line of 
business who are not socially disadvantaged.
    (b) Submission of narrative and financial information. (1) Each 
individual claiming economic disadvantage must describe it in a 
narrative statement, and must submit personal financial information.
    (2) When married, an individual claiming economic disadvantage also 
must submit separate financial information for his or her spouse, unless 
the individual and the spouse are legally separated.
    (c) Factors to be considered. In considering diminished capital and 
credit opportunities, SBA will examine factors relating to the personal 
financial condition of any individual claiming disadvantaged status, 
including personal income for the past two years (including bonuses and 
the value of company

[[Page 241]]

stock given in lieu of cash), personal net worth, and the fair market 
value of all assets, whether encumbered or not. SBA will also consider 
the financial condition of the applicant compared to the financial 
profiles of small businesses in the same primary industry 
classification, or, if not available, in similar lines of business, 
which are not owned and controlled by socially and economically 
disadvantaged individuals in evaluating the individual's access to 
credit and capital. The financial profiles that SBA compares include 
total assets, net sales, pre tax profit, sales/working capital ratio, 
and net worth.
    (1) Transfers within two years. (i) Except as set forth in paragraph 
(c)(1)(ii) of this section, SBA will attribute to an individual claiming 
disadvantaged status any assets which that individual has transferred to 
an immediate family member, or to a trust a beneficiary of which is an 
immediate family member, for less than fair market value, within two 
years prior to a concern's application for participation in the 8(a) BD 
program or within two years of a Participant's annual program review, 
unless the individual claiming disadvantaged status can demonstrate that 
the transfer is to or on behalf of an immediate family member for that 
individual's education, medical expenses, or some other form of 
essential support.
    (ii) SBA will not attribute to an individual claiming disadvantaged 
status any assets transferred by that individual to an immediate family 
member that are consistent with the customary recognition of special 
occasions, such as birthdays, graduations, anniversaries, and 
retirements.
    (iii) In determining an individual's access to capital and credit, 
SBA may consider any assets that the individual transferred within such 
two-year period described by paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section that 
SBA does not consider in evaluating the individual's assets and net 
worth (e.g., transfers to charities).
    (2) Net worth. For initial 8(a) BD eligibility, the net worth of an 
individual claiming disadvantage must be less than $250,000. For 
continued 8(a) BD eligibility after admission to the program, net worth 
must be less than $750,000. In determining such net worth, SBA will 
exclude the ownership interest in the applicant or Participant and the 
equity in the primary personal residence (except any portion of such 
equity which is attributable to excessive withdrawals from the applicant 
or Participant). Exclusions for net worth purposes are not exclusions 
for asset valuation or access to capital and credit purposes.
    (i) A contingent liability does not reduce an individual's net 
worth.
    (ii) The personal net worth of an individual claiming to be an 
Alaska Native will include assets and income from sources other than an 
Alaska Native Corporation and exclude any of the following which the 
individual receives from any Alaska Native Corporation: cash (including 
cash dividends on stock received from an ANC) to the extent that it does 
not, in the aggregate, exceed $2,000 per individual per annum; stock 
(including stock issued or distributed by an ANC as a dividend or 
distribution on stock); a partnership interest; land or an interest in 
land (including land or an interest in land received from an ANC as a 
dividend or distribution on stock); and an interest in a settlement 
trust.


<R05>
Sec. 124.105  What does it mean to be unconditionally owned by one or more disadvantaged individuals?

    An applicant or Participant must be at least 51 percent 
unconditionally and directly owned by one or more socially and 
economically disadvantaged individuals who are citizens of the United 
States, except for concerns owned by Indian tribes, Alaska Native 
Corporations, Native Hawaiian Organizations, or Community Development 
Corporations (CDCs). See Sec. 124.3 for definition of unconditional 
ownership; and Secs. 124.109, 124.110, and 124.111, respectively, for 
special ownership requirements for concerns owned by Indian tribes, 
ANCs, Native Hawaiian Organizations, and CDCs.
    (a) Ownership must be direct. Ownership by one or more disadvantaged 
individuals must be direct ownership. An applicant or Participant owned 
principally by another business entity or by a trust (including employee 
stock ownership trusts) that is in turn owned

[[Page 242]]

and controlled by one or more disadvantaged individuals does not meet 
this requirement. However, ownership by a trust, such as a living trust, 
may be treated as the functional equivalent of ownership by a 
disadvantaged individual where the trust is revocable, and the 
disadvantaged individual is the grantor, a trustee, and the sole current 
beneficiary of the trust.
    (b) Ownership of a partnership. In the case of a concern which is a 
partnership, at least 51 percent of every class of partnership interest 
must be unconditionally owned by one or more individuals determined by 
SBA to be socially and economically disadvantaged. The ownership must be 
reflected in the concern's partnership agreement.
    (c) Ownership of a limited liability company. In the case of a 
concern which is a limited liability company, at least 51 percent of 
each class of member interest must be unconditionally owned by one or 
more individuals determined by SBA to be socially and economically 
disadvantaged.
    (d) Ownership of a corporation. In the case of a concern which is a 
corporation, at least 51 percent of each class of voting stock 
outstanding and 51 percent of the aggregate of all stock outstanding 
must be unconditionally owned by one or more individuals determined by 
SBA to be socially and economically disadvantaged.
    (e) Stock options' effect on ownership. In determining unconditional 
ownership, SBA will disregard any unexercised stock options or similar 
agreements held by disadvantaged individuals. However, any unexercised 
stock options or similar agreements (including rights to convert non-
voting stock or debentures into voting stock) held by non-disadvantaged 
individuals will be treated as exercised, except for any ownership 
interests which are held by investment companies licensed under the 
Small Business Investment Act of 1958.
    (f) Dividends and distributions. One or more disadvantaged 
individuals must be entitled to receive:
    (1) At least 51 percent of the annual distribution of dividends paid 
on the stock of a corporate applicant concern;
    (2) 100 percent of the value of each share of stock owned by them in 
the event that the stock is sold; and
    (3) At least 51 percent of the retained earnings of the concern and 
100 percent of the unencumbered value of each share of stock owned in 
the event of dissolution of the corporation.
    (g) Ownership of another Participant. The individuals determined to 
be disadvantaged for purposes of one Participant, their immediate family 
members, and the Participant itself, may not hold, in the aggregate, 
more than a 20 percent equity ownership interest in any other single 
Participant.
    (h) Ownership restrictions for non-disadvantaged individuals and 
concerns. (1) A non-disadvantaged individual (in the aggregate with all 
immediate family members) or a non-Participant concern that is a general 
partner or stockholder with at least a 10 percent ownership interest in 
one Participant may not own more than a 10 percent interest in another 
Participant that is in the developmental stage or more than a 20 percent 
interest in another Participant in the transitional stage of the 
program. This restriction does not apply to financial institutions 
licensed or chartered by Federal, state or local government, including 
investment companies which are licensed under the Small Business 
Investment Act of 1958.
    (2) A non-Participant concern in the same or similar line of 
business may not own more than a 10 percent interest in a Participant 
that is in the developmental stage or more than a 20 percent interest in 
a Participant in a transitional stage of the program, except that a 
former Participant or a principal of a former Participant (except those 
that have been terminated from 8(a) BD program participation pursuant to 
Secs. 124.303 and 124.304) may have an equity ownership interest of up 
to 20 percent in a current Participant in the developmental stage of the 
program or up to 30 percent in a transitional stage Participant, in the 
same or similar line of business.
    (i) Change of ownership. A Participant may change its ownership or 
business structure so long as one or more disadvantaged individuals own 
and control it after the change and SBA approves the transaction in 
writing prior

[[Page 243]]

to the change. The decision to approve or deny a Participant's request 
for a change in ownership or business structure will be made and 
communicated to the firm by the AA/8(a)BD. The decision of the AA/8(a)BD 
is the final decision of the Agency. The AA/8(a)BD will issue a decision 
within 60 days from receipt of a request containing all necessary 
documentation, or as soon thereafter as possible. If 60 days lapse 
without a decision from SBA, the Participant cannot presume that it can 
complete the change without written approval from SBA. A decision to 
deny a request for change of ownership or business structure may be 
grounds for program termination where the change is made nevertheless.
    (1) Any Participant that was awarded one or more 8(a) contracts may 
substitute one disadvantaged individual for another disadvantaged 
individual without requiring the termination of those contracts or a 
request for waiver under Sec. 124.515, as long as it receives SBA's 
approval prior to the change.
    (2) Where the previous owner held less than a 10 percent interest in 
the concern, or the transfer results from the death or incapacity due to 
a serious, long-term illness or injury of a disadvantaged principal, 
prior approval is not required, but the concern must notify SBA within 
60 days.
    (3) Continued participation of the Participant with new ownership 
and the award of any new 8(a) contracts requires SBA's determination 
that all eligibility requirements are met by the concern and the new 
owners.
    (4) Where a Participant requests a change of ownership or business 
structure, and proceeds with the change prior to receiving SBA approval 
(or where a change of ownership results from the death or incapacity of 
a disadvantaged individual for which a request prior to the change in 
ownership could not occur), SBA will suspend the Participant from 
program benefits pending resolution of the request. If the change is 
approved, the length of the suspension will be restored to the 
Participant's program term in the case of death or incapacity, or if the 
firm requested prior approval and waited 60 days for SBA approval.
    (5) A change in ownership does not provide the new owner(s) with a 
new 8(a) BD program term. For example, if a concern has been in the 8(a) 
BD program for five years when a change in ownership occurs, the new 
owner will have four years remaining until program graduation.
    (j) Public offering. A Participant's request for SBA's approval for 
the issuance of a public offering will be treated as a request for a 
change of ownership. Such request will cause SBA to examine the 
concern's continued need for access to the business development 
resources of the 8(a) BD program.
    (k) Community property laws given effect. In determining ownership 
interests when an owner resides in any of the community property states 
or territories of the United States (Arizona, California, Idaho, 
Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Puerto Rico, Texas, Washington and 
Wisconsin), SBA considers applicable state community property laws. If 
only one spouse claims disadvantaged status, that spouse's ownership 
interest will be considered unconditionally held only to the extent it 
is vested by the community property laws. A transfer or relinquishment 
of interest by the non-disadvantaged spouse may be necessary in some 
cases to establish eligibility.


<R05>
Sec. 124.106  When do disadvantaged individuals control an applicant or Participant?

    Control is not the same as ownership, although both may reside in 
the same person. SBA regards control as including both the strategic 
policy setting exercised by boards of directors and the day-to-day 
management and administration of business operations. An applicant or 
Participant's management and daily business operations must be conducted 
by one or more disadvantaged individuals, except for concerns owned by 
Indian tribes, ANCs, Native Hawaiian Organizations, or Community 
Development Corporations (CDCs). (See Secs. 124.109, 124.110, and 
124.111, respectively, for the requirements for concerns owned by Indian 
tribes or ANCs, for concerns owned by Native Hawaiian Organizations, and 
for CDC-

[[Page 244]]

owned concerns.) Disadvantaged individuals managing the concern must 
have managerial experience of the extent and complexity needed to run 
the concern. A disadvantaged individual need not have the technical 
expertise or possess a required license to be found to control an 
applicant or Participant if he or she can demonstrate that he or she has 
ultimate managerial and supervisory control over those who possess the 
required licenses or technical expertise. However, where a critical 
license is held by a non-disadvantaged individual having an equity 
interest in the applicant or Participant firm, the non-disadvantaged 
individual may be found to control the firm.
    (a)(1) An applicant or Participant must be managed on a full-time 
basis by one or more disadvantaged individuals who possess requisite 
management capabilities.
    (2) A disadvantaged full-time manager must hold the highest officer 
position (usually President or Chief Executive Officer) in the applicant 
or Participant.
    (3) One or more disadvantaged individuals who manage the applicant 
or Participant must devote full-time to the business during the normal 
working hours of firms in the same or similar line of business. Work in 
a wholly-owned subsidiary of the applicant or participant may be 
considered to meet the requirement of full-time devotion. This applies 
only to a subsidiary owned by the 8(a) firm, and not to firms in which 
the disadvantaged individual has an ownership interest.
    (4) Any disadvantaged manager who wishes to engage in outside 
employment must notify SBA of the nature and anticipated duration of the 
outside employment and obtain the prior written approval of SBA. SBA 
will deny a request for outside employment which could conflict with the 
management of the firm or could hinder it in achieving the objectives of 
its business development plan.
    (5) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, a 
disadvantaged owner's unexercised right to cause a change in the control 
or management of the applicant concern does not in itself constitute 
disadvantaged control and management, regardless of how quickly or 
easily the right could be exercised.
    (b) In the case of a partnership, one or more disadvantaged 
individuals must serve as general partners, with control over all 
partnership decisions. A partnership in which no disadvantaged 
individual is a general partner will be ineligible for participation.
    (c) In the case of a limited liability company, one or more 
disadvantaged individuals must serve as management members, with control 
over all decisions of the limited liability company.
    (d) One or more disadvantaged individuals must control the Board of 
Directors of a corporate applicant or Participant.
    (1) SBA will deem disadvantaged individuals to control the Board of 
Directors where:
    (i) A single disadvantaged individual owns 100% of all voting stock 
of an applicant or Participant concern;
    (ii) A single disadvantaged individual owns at least 51% of all 
voting stock of an applicant or Participant concern, the individual is 
on the Board of Directors and no super majority voting requirements 
exist for shareholders to approve corporation actions. Where super 
majority voting requirements are provided for in the concern's articles 
of incorporation, its by-laws, or by state law, the disadvantaged 
individual must own at least the percent of the voting stock needed to 
overcome any such super majority voting requirements; or
    (iii) More than one disadvantaged shareholder seeks to qualify the 
concern (i.e., no one individual owns 51%), each such individual is on 
the Board of Directors, together they own at least 51% of all voting 
stock of the concern, no super majority voting requirements exist, and 
the disadvantaged shareholders can demonstrate that they have made 
enforceable arrangements to permit one of them to vote the stock of all 
as a block without a shareholder meeting. Where the concern has super 
majority voting requirements, the disadvantaged shareholders must own at 
least that percentage of voting stock needed to overcome any such super 
majority ownership requirements.
    (2) Where an applicant or Participant does not meet the requirements 
set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section,

[[Page 245]]

the disadvantaged individual(s) upon whom eligibility is based must 
control the Board of Directors through actual numbers of voting 
directors or, where permitted by state law, through weighted voting 
(e.g., in a concern having a two-person Board of Directors where one 
individual on the Board is disadvantaged and one is not, the 
disadvantaged vote must be weighted--worth more than one vote--in order 
for the concern to be eligible for 8(a) participation). Where a concern 
seeks to comply with this paragraph:
    (i) Provisions for the establishment of a quorum cannot permit non-
disadvantaged Directors to control the Board of Directors, directly or 
indirectly;
    (ii) Any Executive Committee of Directors must be controlled by 
disadvantaged directors unless the Executive Committee can only make 
recommendations to and cannot independently exercise the authority of 
the Board of Directors.
    (3) An applicant must inform SBA of any super majority voting 
requirements provided for in its articles of incorporation, its by-laws, 
by state law, or otherwise. Similarly, after being admitted to the 
program, a Participant must inform SBA of changes regarding super 
majority voting requirements.
    (4) Non-voting, advisory, or honorary Directors may be appointed 
without affecting disadvantaged individuals' control of the Board of 
Directors.
    (5) Arrangements regarding the structure and voting rights of the 
Board of Directors must comply with applicable state law.
    (e) Non-disadvantaged individuals may be involved in the management 
of an applicant or Participant, and may be stockholders, partners, 
limited liability members, officers, and/or directors of the applicant 
or Participant. However, no such non-disadvantaged individual or 
immediate family member may:
    (1) Exercise actual control or have the power to control the 
applicant or Participant;
    (2) Be a former employer or a principal of a former employer of any 
disadvantaged owner of the applicant or Participant, unless it is 
determined by the AA/8(a)BD that the relationship between the former 
employer or principal and the disadvantaged individual or applicant 
concern does not give the former employer actual control or the 
potential to control the applicant or Participant and such relationship 
is in the best interests of the 8(a) BD firm; or
    (3) Receive compensation from the applicant or Participant in any 
form as directors, officers or employees, including dividends, that 
exceeds the compensation to be received by the highest officer (usually 
CEO or President). The highest ranking officer may elect to take a lower 
salary than a non-disadvantaged individual only upon demonstrating that 
it helps the applicant or Participant. In the case of a Participant, the 
Participant must also obtain the prior written consent of the AA/8(a)BD 
or designee before changing the compensation paid to the highest ranking 
officer to be below that paid to a non-disadvantaged individual.
    (f) Non-disadvantaged individuals who transfer majority stock 
ownership or control of the firm to an immediate family member within 
two years prior to the application and remain involved in the firm as a 
stockholder, officer, director, or key employee of the firm are presumed 
to control the firm. The presumption may be rebutted by showing that the 
transferee has independent management experience necessary to control 
the operation of the firm.
    (g) Non-disadvantaged individuals or entities may be found to 
control or have the power to control in any of the following 
circumstances, which are illustrative only and not all inclusive:
    (1) In circumstances where an applicant or Participant seeks to 
establish disadvantaged control of the Board of Directors through 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section, non-disadvantaged individuals control 
the Board of Directors of the applicant or Participant, either directly 
through majority voting membership, or indirectly, where the by-laws 
allow non-disadvantaged individuals effectively to prevent a quorum or 
block actions proposed by the disadvantaged individuals.
    (2) A non-disadvantaged individual or entity, having an equity 
interest in the applicant or participant, provides critical financial or 
bonding support or a

[[Page 246]]

critical license to the applicant or Participant which directly or 
indirectly allows the non-disadvantaged individual significantly to 
influence business decisions of the Participant.
    (3) A non-disadvantaged individual or entity controls the applicant 
or Participant or an individual disadvantaged owner through loan 
arrangements. Providing a loan guaranty on commercially reasonable terms 
does not, by itself, give a non-disadvantaged individual or entity the 
power to control a firm.
    (4) Business relationships exist with non-disadvantaged individuals 
or entities which cause such dependence that the applicant or 
Participant cannot exercise independent business judgment without great 
economic risk.

Sec. 124.107  What is potential for success?

    The applicant concern must possess reasonable prospects for success 
in competing in the private sector if admitted to the 8(a) BD program. 
To do so, it must be in business in its primary industry classification 
for at least two full years immediately prior to the date of its 8(a) BD 
application, unless a waiver for this requirement is granted pursuant to 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (a) Income tax returns for each of the two previous tax years must 
show operating revenues in the primary industry in which the applicant 
is seeking 8(a) BD certification.
    (b)(1) SBA may waive the two years in business requirement if each 
of the following five conditions are met:
    (i) The individual or individuals upon whom eligibility is based 
have substantial business management experience;
    (ii) The applicant has demonstrated technical experience to carry 
out its business plan with a substantial likelihood for success if 
admitted to the 8(a) BD program;
    (iii) The applicant has adequate capital to sustain its operations 
and carry out its business plan as a Participant;
    (iv) The applicant has a record of successful performance on 
contracts from governmental or nongovernmental sources in its primary 
industry category; and
    (v) The applicant has, or can demonstrate its ability to timely 
obtain, the personnel, facilities, equipment, and any other requirements 
needed to perform contracts as a Participant.
    (2) The concern seeking a waiver under paragraph (b) must provide 
information on governmental and nongovernmental contracts in progress 
and completed (including letters of reference) in order to establish 
successful contract performance, and must demonstrate how it otherwise 
meets the five conditions for waiver. SBA considers an applicant's 
performance on both government and private sector contracts in 
determining whether the firm has an overall successful performance 
record. If, however, the applicant has performed only government 
contracts or only private sector contracts, SBA will review its 
performance on those contracts alone to determine whether the applicant 
possesses a record of successful performance.
    (c) In assessing potential for success, SBA considers the concern's 
access to credit and capital, including, but not limited to, access to 
long-term financing, access to working capital financing, equipment 
trade credit, access to raw materials and supplier trade credit, and 
bonding capability.
    (d) In assessing potential for success, SBA will also consider the 
technical and managerial experience of the applicant concern's managers, 
the operating history of the concern, the concern's record of 
performance on previous Federal and private sector contracts in the 
primary industry in which the concern is seeking 8(a) BD certification, 
and its financial capacity. The applicant concern as a whole must 
demonstrate both technical knowledge in its primary industry category 
and management experience sufficient to run its day-to-day operations.
    (e) The Participant or individuals employed by the Participant must 
hold all requisite licenses if the concern is engaged in an industry 
requiring professional licensing (e.g., public accountancy, law, 
professional engineering).
    (f) An applicant will not be denied admission into the 8(a) BD 
program due solely to a determination that potential 8(a) contract 
opportunities are unavailable to assist in the development of the 
concern unless:

[[Page 247]]

    (1) The Government has not previously procured and is unlikely to 
procure the types of products or services offered by the concern; or
    (2) The purchase of such products or services by the Federal 
Government will not be in quantities sufficient to support the 
developmental needs of the applicant and other Participants providing 
the same or similar items or services.


<R05>
Sec. 124.108  What other eligibility requirements apply for individuals or businesses?

    (a) Good character. The applicant or Participant and all its 
principals must have good character.
    (1) If, during the processing of an application, adverse information 
is obtained from the applicant or a credible source regarding possible 
criminal conduct by the applicant or any of its principals, no further 
action will be taken on the application until SBA's Inspector General 
has collected relevant information and has advised the AA/8(a)BD of his 
or her findings. The AA/8(a)BD will consider those findings when 
evaluating the application.
    (2) Violations of any of SBA's regulations may result in denial of 
participation in the 8(a) BD program. The AA/8(a)BD will consider the 
nature and severity of the violation in making an eligibility 
determination.
    (3) Debarred or suspended concerns or concerns owned by debarred or 
suspended persons are ineligible for admission to the 8(a) BD program.
    (4) An applicant is ineligible for admission to the 8(a) BD program 
if the applicant concern or a proprietor, partner, limited liability 
member, director, officer, or holder of at least 10 percent of its 
stock, or another person (including key employees) with significant 
authority over the concern:
    (i) Lacks business integrity as demonstrated by information related 
to an indictment or guilty plea, conviction, civil judgment, or 
settlement; or
    (ii) Is currently incarcerated, or on parole or probation pursuant 
to a pre-trial diversion or following conviction for a felony or any 
crime involving business integrity.
    (5) If, during the processing of an application, SBA determines that 
an applicant has knowingly submitted false information, regardless of 
whether correct information would cause SBA to deny the application, and 
regardless of whether correct information was given to SBA in 
accompanying documents, SBA will deny the application. If, after 
admission to the program, SBA discovers that false information has been 
knowingly submitted by a firm, SBA will initiate termination proceedings 
and suspend the firm under Secs. 124.304 and 124.305. Whenever SBA 
determines that the applicant submitted false information, the matter 
will be referred to SBA's Office of Inspector General for review.
    (b) One-time eligibility. Once a concern or disadvantaged individual 
upon whom eligibility was based has participated in the 8(a) BD program, 
neither the concern nor that individual will be eligible again.
    (1) An individual who claims disadvantage and completes the 
appropriate SBA forms to qualify an applicant has participated in the 
8(a) BD program if SBA approves the application.
    (2) Use of eligibility will take effect on the date of the concern's 
approval for admission into the program.
    (3) An individual who uses his or her one-time eligibility to 
qualify a concern for the 8(a) BD program will be considered a non-
disadvantaged individual for ownership or control purposes of another 
applicant or Participant. The criteria restricting participation by non-
disadvantaged individuals will apply to such an individual. See 
Secs. 124.105 and 124.106.
    (4) When at least 50% of the assets of a concern are the same as 
those of a former Participant, the concern will not be eligible for 
entry into the program.
    (5) Participants which change their form of business organization 
and transfer their assets and liabilities to the new organization may do 
so without affecting the eligibility of the new organization provided 
the previous business is dissolved and all other eligibility criteria 
are met. In such a case, the new organization may complete the remaining 
program term of the previous organization. A request for a change in 
business form will be

[[Page 248]]

treated as a change of ownership under Sec. 124.105(i).
    (c) Wholesalers. An applicant concern seeking admission to the 8(a) 
BD program as a wholesaler need not demonstrate that it is capable of 
meeting the requirements of the nonmanufacturer rule for its primary 
industry classification.
    (d) Brokers. Brokers are ineligible to participate in the 8(a) BD 
program. A broker is a concern that adds no material value to an item 
being supplied to a procuring activity or which does not take ownership 
or possession of or handle the item being procured with its own 
equipment or facilities.
    (e) Federal financial obligations. Neither a firm nor any of its 
principals that fails to pay significant financial obligations owed to 
the Federal Government, including unresolved tax liens and defaults on 
Federal loans or other Federally assisted financing, is eligible for 
admission to or participation in the 8(a) BD program.
    (f) Achievement of benchmarks. Where actual participation by 
disadvantaged businesses in a particular SIC Major Group exceeds the 
benchmark limitations established by the Department of Commerce, SBA, in 
its discretion, may decide not to accept an application for 8(a) BD 
participation from a concern whose primary industry classification falls 
within that Major Group.

Sec. 124.109  Do Indian tribes and Alaska Native Corporations have any special rules for applying to the 8(a) BD program?

    (a) Special rules for ANCs. Small business concerns owned and 
controlled by ANCs are eligible for participation in the 8(a) program 
and must meet the eligibility criteria set forth in Sec. 124.112 to the 
extent the criteria are not inconsistent with this section. ANC-owned 
concerns are subject to the same conditions that apply to tribally-owned 
concerns, as described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, except 
that the following provisions and exceptions apply only to ANC-owned 
concerns:
    (1) Alaska Natives and descendants of Natives must own a majority of 
both the total equity of the ANC and the total voting powers to elect 
directors of the ANC through their holdings of settlement common stock. 
Settlement common stock means stock of an ANC issued pursuant to 43 
U.S.C. 1606(g)(1), which is subject to the rights and restrictions 
listed in 43 U.S.C. 1606(h)(1).
    (2) An ANC that meets the requirements set forth in paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section is deemed economically disadvantaged under 43 U.S.C. 
1626(e), and need not establish economic disadvantage as required by 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (3) Even though an ANC can be either for profit or non-profit, a 
small business concern owned and controlled by an ANC must be for profit 
to be eligible for the 8(a) program. The concern will be deemed owned 
and controlled by the ANC where both the majority of stock or other 
ownership interest and total voting power are held by the ANC and 
holders of its settlement common stock.
    (4) The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act provides that a concern 
which is majority owned by an ANC shall be deemed to be both owned and 
controlled by Alaska Natives and an economically disadvantaged business. 
Therefore, an individual responsible for control and management of an 
ANC-owned applicant or Participant need not establish personal social 
and economic disadvantage.
    (5) Paragraphs (b)(3)(i), (ii) and (iv) of this section are not 
applicable to an ANC, provided its status as an ANC is clearly shown in 
its articles of incorporation.
    (6) Paragraph (c)(1) of this section is not applicable to an ANC-
owned concern to the extent it requires an express waiver of sovereign 
immunity or a ``sue and be sued'' clause.
    (b) Tribal eligibility. In order to qualify a concern which it owns 
and controls for participation in the 8(a) BD program, an Indian tribe 
must establish its own economic disadvantaged status under paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section. Thereafter, it need not reestablish such status 
in order to have other businesses that it owns certified for 8(a) BD 
program participation, unless specifically required to do so by the AA/
8(a)BD or designee. Each tribally-owned concern seeking to be certified 
for 8(a) BD participation must

[[Page 249]]

comply with the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section.
    (1) Social disadvantage. An Indian tribe as defined in Sec. 124.3 is 
considered to be socially disadvantaged.
    (2) Economic disadvantage. In order to be eligible to participate in 
the 8(a) BD program, the Indian tribe must demonstrate to SBA that the 
tribe itself is economically disadvantaged. This must involve the 
consideration of available data showing the tribe's economic condition, 
including but not limited to, the following information:
    (i) The number of tribal members.
    (ii) The present tribal unemployment rate.
    (iii) The per capita income of tribal members, excluding judgment 
awards.
    (iv) The percentage of the local Indian population below the poverty 
level.
    (v) The tribe's access to capital.
    (vi) The tribal assets as disclosed in a current tribal financial 
statement. The statement must list all assets including those which are 
encumbered or held in trust, but the status of those encumbered or in 
trust must be clearly delineated.
    (vii) A list of all wholly or partially owned tribal enterprises or 
affiliates and the primary industry classification of each. The list 
must also specify the members of the tribe who manage or control such 
enterprises by serving as officers or directors.
    (3) Forms and documents required to be submitted. Except as 
otherwise provided in this section, the Indian tribe generally must 
submit the forms and documents required of 8(a) BD applicants as well as 
the following material:
    (i) A copy of all governing documents such as the tribe's 
constitution or business charter.
    (ii) Evidence of its recognition as a tribe eligible for the special 
programs and services provided by the United States or by its state of 
residence.
    (iii) Copies of its articles of incorporation and bylaws as filed 
with the organizing or chartering authority, or similar documents needed 
to establish and govern a non-corporate legal entity.
    (iv) Documents or materials needed to show the tribe's economically 
disadvantaged status as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (c) Business eligibility. In order to be eligible to participate in 
the 8(a) BD program, a concern which is owned by an eligible Indian 
tribe (or wholly owned business entities of such tribe) must meet the 
conditions set forth in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(7) of this 
section.
    (1) Legal business entity organized for profit and susceptible to 
suit. The applicant or participating concern must be a separate and 
distinct legal entity organized or chartered by the tribe, or Federal or 
state authorities. The concern's articles of incorporation, partnership 
agreement or limited liability company articles of organization must 
contain express sovereign immunity waiver language, or a ``sue and be 
sued'' clause which designates United States Federal Courts to be among 
the courts of competent jurisdiction for all matters relating to SBA's 
programs including, but not limited to, 8(a) BD program participation, 
loans, and contract performance. Also, the concern must be organized for 
profit, and the tribe must possess economic development powers in the 
tribe's governing documents.
    (2) Size. (i) A tribally-owned applicant concern must qualify as a 
small business concern as defined for purposes of Federal Government 
procurement in part 121 of this title. The particular size standard to 
be applied is based on the primary industry classification of the 
applicant concern.
    (ii) A tribally-owned Participant must certify to SBA that it is a 
small business pursuant to the provisions of part 121 of this title for 
the purpose of performing each individual contract which it is awarded.
    (iii) In determining the size of a small business concern owned by a 
socially and economically disadvantaged Indian tribe (or a wholly owned 
business entity of such tribe) for either 8(a) BD program entry or 
contract award, the firm's size shall be determined independently 
without regard to its affiliation with the tribe, any entity of the 
tribal government, or any other business enterprise owned by the tribe, 
unless the Administrator determines that one or more such tribally-owned

[[Page 250]]

business concerns have obtained, or are likely to obtain, a substantial 
unfair competitive advantage within an industry category.
    (3) Ownership. (i) For corporate entities, a tribe must own at least 
51 percent of the voting stock and at least 51 percent of the aggregate 
of all classes of stock. For non-corporate entities, a tribe must own at 
least a 51 percent interest.
    (ii) A tribe cannot own 51% or more of another firm which, either at 
the time of application or within the previous two years, has been 
operating in the 8(a) program under the same primary SIC code as the 
applicant. A tribe may, however, own a Participant or an applicant that 
conducts or will conduct secondary business in the 8(a) BD program under 
the same SIC code that a current Participant owned by the tribe operates 
in the 8(a) BD program as its primary SIC code.
    (iii) The restrictions of Sec. 124.105(h) do not apply to tribes; 
they do, however, apply to non disadvantaged individuals or other 
business concerns that are partial owners of a tribally-owned concern.
    (4) Control and management. (i) The management and daily business 
operations of a tribally-owned concern must be controlled by the tribe, 
through one or more disadvantaged individual members who possess 
sufficient management experience of an extent and complexity needed to 
run the concern, or through management as follows:
    (A) Management may be provided by committees, teams, or Boards of 
Directors which are controlled by one or more members of an economically 
disadvantaged tribe, or
    (B) Management may be provided by non-tribal members if SBA 
determines that such management is required to assist the concern's 
development, that the tribe will retain control of all management 
decisions common to boards of directors, including strategic planning, 
budget approval, and the employment and compensation of officers, and 
that a written management development plan exists which shows how 
disadvantaged tribal members will develop managerial skills sufficient 
to manage the concern or similar tribally-owned concerns in the future.
    (ii) Members of the management team, business committee members, 
officers, and directors are precluded from engaging in any outside 
employment or other business interests which conflict with the 
management of the concern or prevent the concern from achieving the 
objectives set forth in its business development plan. This is not 
intended to preclude participation in tribal or other activities which 
do not interfere with such individual's responsibilities in the 
operation of the applicant concern.
    (5) Individual eligibility limitation. SBA does not deem an 
individual involved in the management or daily business operations of a 
tribally-owned concern to have used his or her individual eligibility 
within the meaning of Sec. 124.108(b).
    (6) Potential for success. (i) A tribally-owned applicant concern 
must be in business for at least two years, as evidenced by income tax 
returns for each of the two previous tax years showing operating 
revenues in the primary industry in which the applicant is seeking 8(a) 
BD certification, or demonstrate potential for success as set forth in 
paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section.
    (ii) In determining whether a tribally-owned concern has the 
potential for success, SBA will look at a number of factors including, 
but not limited to:
    (A) The technical and managerial experience and competency of the 
individual(s) who will manage and control the daily operation of the 
concern;
    (B) The financial capacity of the concern; and
    (C) The concern's record of performance on any previous Federal or 
private sector contracts in the primary industry in which the concern is 
seeking 8(a) certification.
    (7) Other eligibility criteria. (i) As with other 8(a) applicants, a 
tribally-owned applicant concern shall not be denied admission into the 
8(a) program due solely to a determination that specific contract 
opportunities are unavailable to assist the development of the concern 
unless:

[[Page 251]]

    (A) The Government has not previously procured and is unlikely to 
procure the types of products or services offered by the concern; or
    (B) The purchase of such products or services by the Federal 
Government will not be in quantities sufficient to support the 
developmental needs of the applicant and other program participants 
providing the same or similar items or services.
    (ii) Except for the tribe itself, the concern's officers, directors, 
and all shareholders owning an interest of 20% or more must demonstrate 
good character. See Sec. 124.108(a).


<R05>
Sec. 124.110  Do Native Hawaiian Organizations have any special rules for applying to the 8(a) BD program?

    (a) Concerns owned by economically disadvantaged Native Hawaiian 
Organizations, as defined in Sec. 124.3, are eligible for participation 
in the 8(a) program and other federal programs requiring SBA to 
determine social and economic disadvantage as a condition of 
eligibility. Such concerns must meet all eligibility criteria set forth 
in Secs. 124.101 through 124.108 and Sec. 124.112 to the extent that 
they are not inconsistent with this section.
    (b) A concern owned by a Native Hawaiian Organization must qualify 
as a small business concern as defined in part 121 of this title. The 
size standard corresponding to the primary industry classification of 
the applicant concern applies for determining size. SBA will determine 
the concern's size independently, without regard to its affiliation with 
the Native Hawaiian Organization or any other business enterprise owned 
by the Native Hawaiian Organization, unless the Administrator determines 
that one or more such concerns owned by the Native Hawaiian Organization 
have obtained, or are likely to obtain, a substantial unfair competitive 
advantage within an industry category.
    (c) A Native Hawaiian Organization cannot own 51% or more of another 
firm which, either at the time of application or within the previous two 
years, has been operating in the 8(a) program under the same primary SIC 
code as the applicant. A Native Hawaiian Organization may, however, own 
a Participant or an applicant that conducts or will conduct secondary 
business in the 8(a) BD program under the same SIC code that a current 
Participant owned by the Native Hawaiian Organization operates in the 
8(a) BD program as its primary SIC code.
    (d) SBA does not deem an individual involved in the management or 
daily business operations of a Participant owned by a Native Hawaiian 
Organization to have used his or her individual eligibility within the 
meaning of Sec. 124.108(b).
    (e)(1) An applicant concern owned by a Native Hawaiian Organization 
must be in business for at least two years, as evidenced by income tax 
returns for each of the two previous tax years showing operating 
revenues in the primary industry in which the applicant is seeking 8(a) 
BD certification, or demonstrate potential for success as set forth in 
paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
    (2) In determining whether a concern owned by a Native Hawaiian 
Organization has the potential for success, SBA will look at a number of 
factors including, but not limited to:
    (i) The technical and managerial experience and competence of the 
individual(s) who will manage and control the daily operation of the 
concern.
    (ii) The financial capacity of the concern; and
    (iii) The concern's record of performance on any previous Federal or 
private sector contracts in the primary industry in which the concern is 
seeking 8(a) certification.


<R05>
Sec. 124.111  Do Community Development Corporations (CDCs) have any special rules for applying to the 8(a) BD program?

    (a) Concerns owned at least 51 percent by CDCs (or a wholly owned 
business entity of a CDC) are eligible for participation in the 8(a) BD 
program and other federal programs requiring SBA to determine social and 
economic disadvantage as a condition of eligibility. These concerns must 
meet all eligibility criteria set forth in Sec. 124.101 through 
Sec. 124.108 and Sec. 124.112 to the extent that they are not 
inconsistent with this section.
    (b) A concern that is at least 51 percent owned by a CDC (or a 
wholly

[[Page 252]]

owned business entity of a CDC) is considered to be controlled by such 
CDC and eligible for participation in the 8(a) BD program, provided it 
meets all eligibility criteria set forth or referred to in this section 
and its management and daily business operations are conducted by one or 
more individuals determined to have managerial experience of an extent 
and complexity needed to run the concern.
    (c) A concern that is at least 51 percent owned by a CDC (or a 
wholly owned business entity of a CDC) must qualify as a small business 
concern as defined in part 121 of this title. The size standard 
corresponding to the primary industry classification of the applicant 
concern applies for determining size. SBA will determine the concern's 
size independently, without regard to its affiliation with the CDC or 
any other business enterprise owned by the CDC, unless the Administrator 
determines that one or more such concerns owned by the CDC have 
obtained, or are likely to obtain, a substantial unfair competitive 
advantage within an industry category.
    (d) A CDC cannot own 51% or more of another firm which, either at 
the time of application or within the previous two years, has been 
operating in the 8(a) program under the same primary SIC code as the 
applicant. A CDC may, however, own a Participant or an applicant that 
conducts or will conduct secondary business in the 8(a) BD program under 
the same SIC code that a current Participant owned by the CDC operates 
in the 8(a) BD program as its primary SIC code.
    (e) SBA does not deem an individual involved in the management or 
daily business operations of a CDC-owned concern to have used his or her 
individual eligibility within the meaning of Sec. 124.108(b).
    (f)(1) A CDC-owned applicant concern must be in business for at 
least two years, as evidenced by income tax returns for each of the two 
previous tax years showing operating revenues in the primary industry in 
which the applicant is seeking 8(a) BD certification, or demonstrate 
potential for success as set forth in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
    (2) In determining whether a CDC-owned concern has the potential for 
success, SBA will look at a number of factors including, but not limited 
to:
    (i) The technical and managerial experience and competence of the 
individual(s) who will manage and control the daily operation of the 
concern;
    (ii) The financial capacity of the concern; and
    (iii) The concern's record of performance on any previous Federal or 
private sector contracts in the primary industry in which the concern is 
seeking 8(a) certification.
    (g) A CDC-owned applicant and all of its principals must have good 
character as set forth in Sec. 124.108(a).


<R05>
Sec. 124.112  What criteria must a business meet to remain eligible to participate in the 8(a) BD program?

    (a) Standards. In order for a concern (except those owned by Indian 
tribes, ANCs, Native Hawaiian Organizations or CDCs) to remain eligible 
for 8(a) BD program participation, it must continue to meet all 
eligibility criteria contained in Sec. 124.101 through Sec. 124.108. For 
concerns owned by Indian tribes, ANCs, Native Hawaiian Organizations or 
CDCs to remain eligible, they must meet the criteria set forth in this 
Sec. 124.112 to the extent that they are not inconsistent with 
Sec. 124.109, Sec. 124.110 and Sec. 124.111, respectively. The concern 
must inform SBA in writing of any changes in circumstances which would 
adversely affect its program eligibility, especially economic 
disadvantage and ownership and control. Any concern that fails to meet 
the eligibility requirements after being admitted to the program will be 
subject to termination or early graduation under Secs. 124.302 through 
124.304, as appropriate.
    (b) Submissions supporting continued eligibility. As part of an 
annual review, each Participant must annually submit to the servicing 
district office the following:
    (1) A certification that it meets the 8(a) BD program eligibility 
requirements as set forth in Sec. 124.101 through Sec. 124.108 and 
paragraph (a) of this section;
    (2) A certification that there have been no changed circumstances 
which could adversely affect the Participant's

[[Page 253]]

program eligibility. If the Participant is unable to provide such 
certification, the Participant must inform SBA of any changes and 
provide relevant supporting documentation.
    (3) Personal financial information for each disadvantaged owner;
    (4) A record from each individual claiming disadvantaged status 
regarding the transfer of assets for less than fair market value to any 
immediate family member, or to a trust any beneficiary of which is an 
immediate family member, within two years of the date of the annual 
review. The record must provide the name of the recipient(s) and family 
relationship, and the difference between the fair market value of the 
asset transferred and the value received by the disadvantaged 
individual.
    (5) A record of all payments, compensation, and distributions 
(including loans, advances, salaries and dividends) made by the 
Participant to each of its owners, officers or directors, or to any 
person or entity affiliated with such individuals;
    (6) If it is an approved protege, a narrative report detailing the 
contacts it has had with its mentor and benefits it has received from 
the mentor/protege relationship. See Sec. 124.520(b)(4) for additional 
annual requirements;
    (7) IRS Form 4506, Request for Copy or Transcript of Tax Form; and
    (8) Such other information as SBA may deem necessary. For other 
required annual submissions, see Secs. 124.601 through 124.603.
    (c) Eligibility reviews. (1) Upon receipt of specific and credible 
information alleging that a Participant no longer meets the eligibility 
requirements for continued program eligibility, SBA will review the 
concern's eligibility for continued participation in the program.
    (2) Sufficient reasons for SBA to conclude that a socially 
disadvantaged individual is no longer economically disadvantaged 
include, but are not limited to, excessive withdrawals of funds or other 
assets withdrawn from the concern by its owners, or substantial personal 
assets, income or net worth of any disadvantaged owner. SBA may also 
consider access by the Participant firm to a significant new source of 
capital or loans since the financial condition of the Participant is 
considered in evaluating the disadvantaged individual's economic status.
    (d) Excessive withdrawals. (1) The term withdrawal includes, but is 
not limited to, the following: officer's salary; cash dividends; 
distributions in excess of amounts needed to pay S Corporation taxes; 
cash and property withdrawals; bonuses; loans; advances; payments to 
immediate family members; investments on behalf of an owner, officer, or 
key employee; acquisition of a business not merged with the 8(a) 
Participant; charitable contributions; and speculative ventures.
    (2) If SBA determines that excessive funds or other assets have been 
withdrawn from the Participant, SBA may:
    (i) Initiate termination proceedings under Secs. 124.303 and 124.304 
where the withdrawals detrimentally affect the achievement of the 
Participant's targets, objectives and goals set forth in its business 
plan, or its overall business development;
    (ii) Initiate early graduation proceedings under Secs. 124.302 and 
124.303 where the withdrawals do not adversely affect the Participant's 
business development; or
    (iii) Require an appropriate reinvestment of funds or other assets, 
as well as any other actions SBA deems necessary to counteract the 
detrimental effects of the withdrawals, as a condition of the 
Participant maintaining program eligibility.
    (3) Withdrawals are excessive if during any fiscal year of the 
Participant they exceed (i) $150,000 for firms with sales up to 
$1,000,000; (ii) $200,000 for firms with sales between $1,000,000 and 
$2,000,000; and (iii) $300,000 for firms with sales over $2,000,000.
    (4) The fact that a concern's net worth has increased despite 
withdrawals that are deemed excessive will not preclude SBA from 
determining that such withdrawals were detrimental to the attainment of 
the concern's business objectives or to its overall business 
development.

                     Applying to the 8(a) BD Program


<R05>
Sec. 124.201  May any business submit an application?

    Any concern or any individual on behalf of a business has the right 
to apply for 8(a) BD program participation whether or not there is an 
appearance of eligibility.


<R05>
Sec. 124.202  Where must an application be filed?

    An application for 8(a) BD program admission must be filed in the 
SBA Division of Program Certification and Eligibility (DPCE) field 
office serving the territory in which the principal place of business is 
located. The SBA district office will provide an applicant concern with 
information regarding the 8(a) BD program and with all required 
application forms.


<R05>
Sec. 124.203  What must a concern submit to apply to the 8(a) BD program?

    Each 8(a) BD applicant concern must submit those forms and 
attachments required by SBA when applying for admission to the 8(a) BD 
program. These forms and attachments will include, but not be limited 
to, financial statements, Federal personal and business tax returns, and 
personal history statements. An applicant must also submit IRS Form 
4506, Request for Copy or Transcript of Tax Form, to SBA. The 
application package may be in the form of an electronic application.


<R05>
Sec. 124.204  How does SBA process applications for 8(a) BD program admission?

    (a) The AA/8(a)BD is authorized to approve or decline applications 
for admission to the 8(a) BD program. The appropriate DPCE field office 
will receive, review and evaluate all 8(a) BD applications except those 
from ANC-owned applicants. SBA's Anchorage District Office will receive 
all applications from ANC-owned applicants and review them for 
completeness before sending them to the AA/8(a)BD for further 
processing. The appropriate field office will advise each program 
applicant within 15 days after the receipt of an application whether the 
application is complete and suitable for evaluation and, if not, what 
additional information or clarification is required to complete the 
application. SBA will process an application for 8(a) BD program 
participation within 90 days of receipt of a complete application 
package by the DPCE field office. Incomplete application packages will 
not be processed.
    (b) SBA, in its sole discretion, may request clarification of 
information contained in the application at any time in the application 
process. SBA will take into account any clarifications made by an 
applicant in response to a request for such by SBA.
    (c) An applicant concern's eligibility will be based on 
circumstances existing on the date of application, except where 
clarification is made pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section or as 
provided in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (d) Changed circumstances for an applicant concern occurring 
subsequent to its application and which adversely affect eligibility 
will be considered and may constitute grounds for decline. The applicant 
must inform SBA of any changed circumstances that could adversely affect 
its eligibility for the program (particularly economic disadvantage and 
ownership and control) during its application review. Failure to inform 
SBA of any such changed circumstances constitutes good cause for which 
SBA may terminate the Participant if non-compliance is discovered after 
admittance.
    (e) The decision of the AA/8(a)BD to approve or deny an application 
will be in writing. A decision to deny admission will state the specific 
reasons for denial, and will inform the applicant of any appeal rights.
    (f) If the AA/8(a)BD approves the application, the date of the 
approval letter is the date of program certification for purposes of 
determining the concern's program term.


<R05>
Sec. 124.205  Can an applicant ask SBA to reconsider SBA's initial decision to decline its application?

    (a) An applicant may request the AA/8(a)BD to reconsider his or her 
initial decline decision by filing a request for reconsideration with 
the SBA field office that originally processed its application. Filing 
means submission by

[[Page 255]]

personal delivery, first-class mail, express mail, fascimile 
transmission followed by first-class mail, or commercial delivery 
service. The applicant must submit its request for reconsideration 
within 45 days of receiving notice that its application was declined. 
The applicant must provide any additional information and documentation 
pertinent to overcoming the reason(s) for the initial decline.
    (b) The AA/8(a)BD will issue a written decision within 45 days of 
the regional DPCE's receipt of the applicant's request. The AA/8(a)BD 
may either approve the application, deny it on the same grounds as the 
original decision, or deny it on other grounds. If denied, the AA/8(a)BD 
will explain why the applicant is not eligible for admission to the 8(a) 
BD program and give specific reasons for the decline.
    (c) If the AA/8(a)BD declines the application solely on issues not 
raised in the initial decline, the applicant can ask for reconsideration 
as if it were an initial decline.


<R05>
Sec. 124.206  What appeal rights are available to an applicant that has been denied admission?

    (a) An applicant may appeal a denial of program admission to SBA's 
Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA), if it is based solely on a 
negative finding of social disadvantage, economic disadvantage, 
ownership, control, or any combination of these four criteria. A denial 
decision that is based at least in part on the failure to meet any other 
eligibility criterion is not appealable and is the final decision of 
SBA.
    (b) The applicant may appeal an initial decision of the AA/8(a)BD 
without requesting reconsideration, or may appeal the decision of the 
AA/8(a)BD on reconsideration.
    (c) The applicant may initiate an appeal by filing a petition in 
accordance with part 134 of this title with OHA within 45 days of the 
date of service (as defined in Sec. 134.204) of the Agency decision.
    (d) If an appeal is filed with OHA, the written decision of the 
Administrative Law Judge is the final Agency decision. If an appealable 
decision is not appealed, the decision of the AA/8(a)BD is the final 
Agency decision.


<R05>
Sec. 124.207  Can an applicant reapply for admission to the 8(a) BD program?

    A concern which has been declined for 8(a) BD program admission may 
submit a new application for admission to the program 12 months after 
the date of the final Agency decision to decline.

                       Exiting the 8(a) BD Program


<R05>
Sec. 124.301  What are the ways a business may leave the 8(a) BD program?

    A concern participating in the 8(a) BD program may leave the program 
by any of the following means:
    (a) Graduation upon the expiration of the program term established 
pursuant to Sec. 124.2;
    (b) Voluntary early graduation;
    (c) Early graduation pursuant to the provisions of Secs. 124.302 and 
124.304; or
    (d) Termination pursuant to the provisions of Secs. 124.303 and 
124.304.


<R05>
Sec. 124.302  What is early graduation?

    (a) General. SBA may graduate a firm from the 8(a) BD program prior 
to the expiration of its Program Term where SBA determines that:
    (1) The concern has successfully completed the 8(a) BD program by 
substantially achieving the targets, objectives, and goals set forth in 
its business plan prior to the expiration of its program term, and has 
demonstrated the ability to compete in the marketplace without 
assistance under the 8(a) BD program; or
    (2) One or more of the disadvantaged owners upon whom the 
Participant's eligibility is based are no longer economically 
disadvantaged.
    (b) Criteria for determining whether a Participant has met its goals 
and objectives. In determining whether a Participant has substantially 
achieved the targets, objectives and goals of its business plan and in 
assessing the overall competitive strength and viability of a 
Participant, SBA considers the totality of circumstances, including the 
following factors:
    (1) Degree of sustained profitability;
    (2) Sales trends, including improved ratio of non-8(a) sales to 8(a) 
sales since program entry;

[[Page 256]]

    (3) Business net worth, financial ratios, working capital, 
capitalization, and access to credit and capital;
    (4) Current ability to obtain bonding;
    (5) A comparison of the Participant's business and financial 
profiles with profiles of non-8(a) BD businesses having the same primary 
four-digit SIC code as the Participant;
    (6) Strength of management experience, capability, and expertise; 
and
    (7) Ability to operate successfully without 8(a) contracts.
    (c) Excessive withdrawals. SBA may graduate a Participant prior to 
the expiration of its program term where excessive funds or other assets 
have been withdrawn from the Participant (see Sec. 124.112(d)(3)), 
causing SBA to determine that the Participant has demonstrated the 
ability to compete in the marketplace without assistance under the 8(a) 
BD program.
    (d) Benchmark achievement. SBA may graduate a Participant prior to 
the expiration of its program term where the Participant has 
substantially achieved the targets, objectives and goals of its business 
plan as adjusted under Sec. 124.403(d) and its primary industry 
classification falls within a SIC Major Group in which the benchmarks 
described in Sec. 124.403(d) have been achieved.

[63 FR 35739, 35772, June 30, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 124.303  What is termination?

    (a) SBA may terminate the participation of a concern in the 8(a) BD 
program prior to the expiration of the concern's Program Term for good 
cause. Examples of good cause include, but are not limited to, the 
following:
    (1) Submission of false information in the concern's 8(a) BD 
application, regardless of whether correct information would have caused 
the concern to be denied admission to the program, and regardless of 
whether correct information was given to SBA in accompanying documents 
or by other means.
    (2) Failure by the concern to maintain its eligibility for program 
participation.
    (3) Failure by the concern for any reason, including the death of an 
individual upon whom eligibility was based, to maintain ownership, full-
time day-to-day management, and control by disadvantaged individuals.
    (4) Failure by the concern to obtain prior written approval from SBA 
for any changes in ownership or business structure, management or 
control pursuant to Secs. 124.105 and 124.106.
    (5) Failure by the concern to disclose to SBA the extent to which 
non-disadvantaged persons or firms participate in the management of the 
Participant business concern.
    (6) Failure by the concern or one or more of the concern's 
principals to maintain good character.
    (7) A pattern of failure to make required submissions or responses 
to SBA in a timely manner, including a failure to provide required 
financial statements, requested tax returns, reports, updated business 
plans, information requested by SBA's Office of Inspector General, or 
other requested information or data within 30 days of the date of 
request.
    (8) Cessation of business operations by the concern.
    (9) Failure by the concern to pursue competitive and commercial 
business in accordance with its business plan, or failure in other ways 
to make reasonable efforts to develop and achieve competitive viability.
    (10) A pattern of inadequate performance by the concern of awarded 
section 8(a) contracts.
    (11) Failure by the concern to pay or repay significant financial 
obligations owed to the Federal Government.
    (12) Failure by the concern to obtain and keep current any and all 
required permits, licenses, and charters, including suspension or 
revocation of any professional license required to operate the business.
    (13) Excessive withdrawals, including transfers of funds or other 
business assets, from the concern for the personal benefit of any of its 
owners or any person or entity affiliated with the owners that hinder 
the development of the concern (see Sec. 124.112(d).
    (14) Unauthorized use of SBA direct or guaranteed loan proceeds or 
violation of an SBA loan agreement.
    (15) Submission by or on behalf of a Participant of false 
information to SBA, including false certification of

[[Page 257]]

compliance with non-8(a) business activity targets under Sec. 124.507 or 
failure to report changes that adversely affect the program eligibility 
of an applicant or program participant under Sec. 124.204 and 
Sec. 124.112, where responsible officials of the 8(a) BD Participant 
knew or should have known the submission to be false.
    (16) Debarment, suspension, voluntary exclusion, or ineligibility of 
the concern or its principals pursuant to part 145 of this title or FAR 
subpart 9.4 (48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4).
    (17) Conduct by the concern, or any of its principals, indicating a 
lack of business integrity. Such conduct may be demonstrated by 
information related to a criminal indictment or guilty plea, a criminal 
conviction, or a judgment or settlement in a civil case.
    (18) Willful failure by the Participant business concern to comply 
with applicable labor standards and obligations.
    (19) Material breach of any terms and conditions of the 8(a) BD 
Program Participation Agreement.
    (20) Willful violation by a concern, or any of its principals, of 
any SBA regulation pertaining to material issues.
    (b) The examples of good cause listed in paragraph (a) of this 
section are intended to be illustrative only. Other grounds for 
terminating a Participant from the 8(a) BD program for cause may exist 
and may be used by SBA.


<R05>
Sec. 124.304  What are the procedures for early graduation and termination?

    (a) General. The same procedures apply to both early graduation and 
termination of Participants from the 8(a) BD program.
    (b) Letter of Intent to Terminate or Graduate Early. When SBA 
believes that a Participant should be terminated or graduated prior to 
the expiration of its program term, SBA will notify the concern in 
writing. The Letter of Intent to Terminate or Graduate Early will set 
forth the specific facts and reasons for SBA's findings, and will notify 
the concern that it has 30 days from the date of service (as defined in 
Sec. 134.204 of this title) of the letter to submit a written response 
to SBA explaining why the proposed ground(s) should not justify 
termination or early graduation. Service is defined in Sec. 134.204.
    (c) Recommendation and decision. Following the 30-day response 
period, the Assistant Administrator for DPCE (AA/DPCE) or designee will 
consider the proposed early graduation or termination and any 
information submitted in response by the concern. Upon determining that 
early graduation or termination is not warranted, the AA/DPCE or 
designee will notify the Participant in writing. If early graduation or 
termination appears warranted, the AA/DPCE will make such a 
recommendation to the AA/8(a)BD, who will then make a decision whether 
to early graduate or terminate the concern. SBA will act in a timely 
manner in processing early graduation and termination actions.
    (d) Notice requirements. Upon deciding that early graduation or 
termination is warranted, the AA/8(a)BD will issue a Notice of Early 
Graduation or Termination. The Notice will set forth the specific facts 
and reasons for the decision, and will advise the concern that it may 
appeal the decision in accordance with the provisions of part 134 of 
this title.
    (e) Appeal to OHA. Procedures governing appeals of early graduation 
or termination to SBA's OHA are set forth in part 134. If a Participant 
does not appeal a Notification of Early Graduation or Termination within 
45 days of the date of service (as defined in Sec. 134.204), the 
decision of the AA/8(a)BD is the final agency decision effective on the 
date the appeal right expired.
    (f) Effect of early graduation or termination. After the effective 
date of early graduation or termination, a Participant is no longer 
eligible to receive any 8(a) BD program assistance. However, such 
concern is obligated to complete previously awarded 8(a) contracts, 
including any priced options which may be exercised.


<R05>
Sec. 124.305  What is suspension and how is a Participant suspended from the 8(a) BD program?

    (a) At any time after SBA issues a Letter of Intent to Terminate 
pursuant to Sec. 124.304, the AA/8(a)BD may suspend 8(a) contract 
support and all other

[[Page 258]]

forms of 8(a) BD program assistance to that concern until the issue of 
the concern's termination from the program is finally decided. The AA/
8(a)BD may suspend a Participant when he or she determines that 
suspension is needed to protect the interests of the Federal Government, 
such as where information showing a clear lack of program eligibility or 
conduct indicating a lack of business integrity exists, including where 
the concern or one of its principals submitted false statements to the 
Federal Government. SBA will suspend a Participant where SBA determines 
that the Participant submitted false information in its 8(a) BD 
application.
    (b) SBA will issue a Notice of Suspension to the Participant's last 
known address by certified mail, return receipt requested. Suspension is 
effective as of the date of the issuance of the Notice. The Notice will 
provide the following information:
    (1) The basis for the suspension;
    (2) A statement that the suspension will continue pending the 
completion of further investigation, a final program termination 
determination, or some other specified period of time;
    (3) A statement that awards of competitive and non-competitive 8(a) 
contracts, including those which have been ``self-marketed'' by a 
Participant, will not be made during the pendency of the suspension 
unless it is determined by the head of the relevant procuring agency or 
an authorized representative to be in the best interest of the 
Government to do so, and SBA adopts that determination;
    (4) A statement that the concern is obligated to complete previously 
awarded section 8(a) contracts;
    (5) A statement that the suspension is effective nationally 
throughout SBA;
    (6) A statement that a request for a hearing on the suspension will 
be considered by an Administrative Law Judge at OHA, and granted or 
denied as a matter of discretion.
    (7) A statement that the firm's participation in the program is 
suspended effective on the date the Notice is served, and that the 
program term will resume only if the suspension is lifted or the firm is 
not terminated.
    (c) The applicant concern may appeal a Notice of Suspension by 
filing a petition in accordance with part 134 of this title with OHA 
within 45 days of the date of service (as defined in Sec. 134.204) of a 
Notice of Suspension pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section. It is 
contemplated that in most cases a hearing on the issue of the suspension 
will be afforded if the Participant requests one, but authority to grant 
a hearing is within the discretion of the Administrative Law Judge in 
OHA. A suspension remains in effect pending the result of its appeal.
    (d) SBA has the burden of showing that adequate evidence exists that 
protection of the Federal Government's interest requires suspension 
before OHA or the AA/8(a)BD makes a final determination regarding the 
termination action.
    (1) The term ``adequate evidence'' means information contained in 
the record before the AA/8(a)BD at the time of his or her suspension 
decision that is sufficient to support the reasonable belief that the 
Government's interests need to be protected.
    (2) SBA need not demonstrate that an act or omission actually 
occurred in order for OHA to uphold a suspension. SBA's burden in a 
suspension proceeding is limited to demonstrating that it had a 
reasonable belief that a particular act or omission occurred, and that 
that act or omission requires suspension to protect the interests of the 
Government.
    (3) Unless the Administrative Law Judge consolidates the suspension 
and termination proceedings, OHA's review is limited to determining 
whether the Government's interests need to be protected, and will not 
consider the merits of the termination action.
    (e) If there is a timely appeal, the decision of the Administrative 
Law Judge is the final SBA decision. If there is not a timely appeal, 
the decision of the AA/8(a)BD is the final Agency decision.
    (f) Upon the request of SBA, OHA may consolidate suspension and 
termination proceedings when the issues presented are identical.
    (g) Any program suspension which occurs under this section is 
effective

[[Page 259]]

until such time as SBA lifts the suspension or the Participant's 
participation in the program is fully terminated. If the concern is 
ultimately not terminated from the 8(a) BD program, the suspension will 
be lifted and the length of the suspension will be added to the 
concern's program term.
    (h) SBA may suspend a Participant from program benefits where a 
change of ownership or business structure has been requested if 
ownership or control of the participant changed prior to SBA's approval 
pending resolution of the request to change its ownership or control. If 
the change of ownership is approved, the length of the suspension will 
be added to the firm's program term where the change in ownership 
results from the death or incapacity of a disadvantaged individual or 
where the firm requested prior approval and waited 60 days for SBA 
approval before making the change. The suspension will be commenced by 
the issuance of a notice similar to that required for termination-
related suspensions under paragraph (b) of this section, except that a 
change of ownership suspension is not appealable.
    (i) SBA does not recognize the concept of de facto suspension. 
Adding time to the end of a Participant's program term equal to the 
length of a suspension will occur only where a concern's program 
participation has been formally suspended in accordance with the 
procedures set forth in this section.
    (j) A suspension from 8(a) BD participation under this section has 
no effect on a concern's eligibility for non-8(a) Federal Government 
contracts. However, a debarment or suspension under the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR, chapter 1) will disqualify a concern 
from receiving all Federal Government contracts, including 8(a) 
contracts.

                          Business Development


<R05>
Sec. 124.401  Which SBA field office services a Participant?

    The SBA district office which serves the geographical territory 
where a Participant's principal place of business is located normally 
will service the concern during its participation in the 8(a) BD 
program.


<R05>
Sec. 124.402  How does a Participant develop a business plan?

    (a) General. In order to assist the SBA servicing office in 
determining the business development needs of its portfolio 
Participants, each Participant must develop a comprehensive business 
plan setting forth its business targets, objectives, and goals.
    (b) Submission of initial business plan. Each Participant must 
submit a business plan to its SBA servicing office as soon as possible 
after program admission. The Participant will not be eligible for 8(a) 
BD program benefits, including 8(a) contracts, until SBA approves its 
business plan.
    (c) Contents of business plan. The business plan must contain at 
least the following:
    (1) A detailed description of any products currently being produced 
and any services currently being performed by the concern, as well as 
any future plans to enter into one or more new markets;
    (2) The applicant's designation of its primary industry 
classification, as defined in Sec. 124.3;
    (3) An analysis of market potential, competitive environment, and 
the concern's prospects for profitable operations during and after its 
participation in the 8(a) BD program;
    (4) An analysis of the concern's strengths and weaknesses, with 
particular attention on ways to correct any financial, managerial, 
technical, or work force conditions which could impede the concern from 
receiving and performing non-8(a) contracts;
    (5) Specific targets, objectives, and goals for the business 
development of the concern during the next two years;
    (6) Estimates of both 8(a) and non-8(a) contract awards that will be 
needed to meet its targets, objectives and goals; and
    (7) Such other information as SBA may require.


<R05>
Sec. 124.403  How is a business plan updated and modified?

    (a) Annual review. Each Participant must annually review its 
business plan with its assigned Business Opportunity Specialist (BOS), 
and modify the plan as appropriate. The Participant must submit a 
modified plan and updated information to its BOS within thirty (30)

[[Page 260]]

days after the close of each program year. It also must submit a 
capability statement describing its current contract performance 
capabilities as part of its updated business plan.
    (b) Contract forecast. As part of the annual review of its business 
plan, each Participant must annually forecast in writing its needs for 
contract awards for the next program year. The forecast must include:
    (1) The aggregate dollar value of 8(a) contracts to be sought, 
broken down by sole source and competitive opportunities where possible;
    (2) The aggregate dollar value of non-8(a) contracts to be sought;
    (3) The types of contract opportunities to be sought, identified by 
product or service; and
    (4) Such other information as SBA may request to aid in providing 
effective business development assistance to the Participant.
    (c) Transition management strategy. Beginning in the first year of 
the transitional stage of program participation, each Participant must 
annually submit a transition management strategy to be incorporated into 
its business plan. The transition management strategy must describe:
    (1) How the Participant intends to meet the applicable non-8(a) 
business activity target imposed by Sec. 124.507 during the transitional 
stage of participation; and
    (2) The specific steps the Participant intends to take to continue 
its business growth and promote profitable business operations after the 
expiration of its program term.
    (d) Benchmark achievement. Where actual participation by 
disadvantaged businesses in a particular SIC Major Group exceeds the 
benchmark limitations established by the Department of Commerce for that 
Major Group, SBA may adjust the targets, objectives and goals contained 
in the business plans of Participants whose primary industry 
classification falls within that Major Group. Any adjustment will take 
into account projected decreases in 8(a) and SDB contracting 
opportunities.

[63 FR 35739, 35772, June 30, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 124.404  What business development assistance is available to Participants during the two stages of participation in the 8(a) BD program?

    (a) General. Participation in the 8(a) BD program is divided into 
two stages, a developmental stage and a transitional stage. The 
developmental stage will last four years, and the transitional stage 
will last five years, unless the concern has exited the program by one 
of the means set forth in Sec. 124.301 prior to the expiration of its 
program term.
    (b) Developmental stage of program participation. A Participant, if 
otherwise eligible, may receive the following assistance during the 
developmental stage of program participation:
    (1) Sole source and competitive 8(a) contract support;
    (2) Financial assistance pursuant to Sec. 120.375 of this title;
    (3) The transfer of technology or surplus property owned by the 
United States pursuant to Sec. 124.405; and
    (4) Training to aid in developing business principles and strategies 
to enhance their ability to compete successfully for both 8(a) and non-
8(a) contracts.
    (c) Transitional stage of program participation. A Participant, if 
otherwise eligible, may receive the following assistance during the 
transitional stage of program participation:
    (1) The same assistance as that provided to Participants in the 
developmental stage;
    (2) Assistance from procuring agencies (in cooperation with SBA) in 
forming joint ventures, leader-follower arrangements, and teaming 
agreements between the concern and other Participants or other business 
concerns with respect to contracting opportunities outside the 8(a) BD 
program for research, development, or full scale engineering or 
production of major systems (these arrangements must comply with all 
relevant statutes and regulations, including applicable size standard 
requirements); and
    (3) Training and technical assistance in transitional business 
planning.

Sec. 124.405  How does a Participant obtain Federal Government surplus property?

    (a) General. (1) Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 636(j)(13)(F), eligible 
Participants may receive surplus Federal Government property from State 
Agencies for Surplus Property (SASPs). The procedures set forth in 41 
CFR Part 101-44 and this section will be used to transfer surplus 
property to eligible Participants.
    (2) The property which may be transferred to SASPs for further 
transfer to eligible Participants includes all personal property which 
has been determined to be ``donable'' as defined in 41 CFR 101-44.001-3.
    (b) Eligibility to receive Federal surplus property. To be eligible 
to receive Federal surplus property, on the date of transfer a concern 
must:
    (1) Be in the 8(a) BD program;
    (2) Be in compliance with all program requirements, including any 
reporting requirements;
    (3) Not be debarred, suspended, or declared ineligible under part 9, 
subpart 9.4 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations, Title 48 of the Code 
of Federal Regulations;
    (4) Not be under a pending 8(a) BD program suspension, termination 
or early graduation proceeding; and
    (5) Be engaged or expect to be engaged in business activities making 
the item useful to it.
    (c) Use of acquired surplus property. (1) Eligible Participants may 
acquire surplus Federal property from any SASP located in any state, 
provided the concern represents and agrees in writing:
    (i) As to what the intended use of the surplus property is to be and 
that this use is consistent with the objectives of the concern's 8(a) 
business plan;
    (ii) That it will use the property to be acquired in the normal 
conduct of its business activities or be liable for the fair rental 
value from the date of its receipt;
    (iii) That it will not sell or transfer the property to be acquired 
to any party other than the Federal Government during its term of 
participation in the 8(a) program and for one year after it leaves the 
program;
    (iv) That, at its own expense, it will return the property to a SASP 
or transfer it to another Participant if directed to do so by SBA 
because it has not used the property as intended within one year of 
receipt;
    (v) That, should it breach its agreement not to sell or transfer the 
property, it will be liable to the Government for the established fair 
market value or the sale price, whichever is greater, of the property 
sold or transferred; and
    (vi) That it will give SBA access to inspect the property and all 
records pertaining to it.
    (2) A firm receiving surplus property pursuant to this section 
assumes all liability associated with or stemming from the use of the 
property.
    (3) If the property is not placed in use for the purposes for which 
it was intended within one year of its receipt, SBA may direct the 
concern to deliver the property to another Participant or to the SASP 
from which it was acquired.
    (4) Failure to comply with any of the commitments made under 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section constitutes a basis for termination 
from the 8(a) program.
    (d) Procedures for acquiring Federal Government surplus property. 
(1) Participants may participate in the surplus property distribution 
program administered by the SASPs to the same extent, but with no 
special priority over, other authorized transferees. See 41 CFR subpart 
101-44.2.
    (2) Each Participant seeking to acquire Federal Government surplus 
property from a SASP must:
    (i) Certify in writing to the SASP that it is eligible to receive 
the property pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section;
    (ii) Make the written representations and agreement required by 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section; and
    (iii) Identify to the SASP its servicing SBA field office.
    (3) Upon receipt of the required certification, representations, 
agreement, and information set forth in paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section, the SASP must contact the appropriate SBA field office and 
obtain SBA's verification that the concern seeking to acquire the 
surplus property is eligible, and that the

[[Page 262]]

identified use of the property is consistent with the concern's business 
activities. SASPs may not release property to a Participant without this 
verification.
    (4) The SASP and the Participant must agree on and record the fair 
market value of the surplus property at the time of the transfer to the 
Participant. The SASP must provide to SBA a written record, including 
the agreed upon fair market value, of each transaction to a Participant 
when any property has been transferred.
    (e) Costs. Participants acquiring surplus property from a SASP must 
pay a service fee to the SASP which is equal to the SASP's direct costs 
of locating, inspecting, and transporting the surplus property. If a 
Participant elects to incur the responsibility and the expense for 
transporting the acquired property, the concern may do so and no 
transportation costs will be charged by the SASP. In addition, the SASP 
may charge a reasonable fee to cover its costs of administering the 
program. In no instance will any SASP charge a Participant more for any 
service than their established fees charged to other transferees.
    (f) Title. The title to surplus property acquired from a SASP will 
pass to the Participant when the Participant executes the applicable 
SASP distribution documents and takes possession of the property.
    (g) Compliance. (1) SBA will periodically review whether 
Participants that have received surplus property have used and 
maintained the property as agreed. This review may include site visits 
to visually inspect the property to ensure that it is being used in a 
manner consistent with the terms of its transfer.
    (2) Participants must provide SBA with access to all relevant 
records upon request.
    (3) Where SBA receives credible information that transferred surplus 
property may have been disposed of or otherwise used in a manner that is 
not consistent with the terms of the transfer, SBA may investigate such 
claim to determine its validity.
    (4) SBA may take any action to correct any noncompliance involving 
the use of transferred property still in possession of the Participant 
or to enforce any terms, conditions, reservations, or restrictions 
imposed on the property by the distribution document. Actions to enforce 
compliance, or which may be taken as a result of noncompliance, include 
the following:
    (i) Requiring that the property be placed in proper use within a 
specified time;
    (ii) Requiring that the property be transferred to another 
Participant having a need and use for the property, returned to the SASP 
serving the area where the property is located for distribution to 
another eligible transferee or to another SASP, or transferred through 
GSA to another Federal agency;
    (iii) Recovery of the fair rental value of the property from the 
date of its receipt by the Participant; and
    (iv) Initiation of proceedings to terminate the Participant from the 
8(a) BD program.
    (5) Where SBA finds that a recipient has sold or otherwise disposed 
of the acquired surplus property in violation of the agreement covering 
sale and disposal, the Participant is liable for the agreed upon fair 
market value of the property at the time of the transfer, or the sale 
price, whichever is greater. However, a Participant need not repay any 
amount where it can demonstrate to SBA's satisfaction that the property 
is no longer useful for the purpose for which it was transferred and 
receives SBA's prior written consent to transfer the property. For 
example, if a piece of equipment breaks down beyond repair, it may be 
disposed of without being subject to the repayment provision, so long as 
the concern receives SBA's prior consent.
    (6) Any funds received by SBA in enforcement of this section will be 
remitted promptly to the Treasury of the United States as miscellaneous 
receipts.

                         Contractual Assistance


<R05>
Sec. 124.501  What general provisions apply to the award of 8(a) contracts?

    (a) Pursuant to section 8(a) of the Small Business Act, SBA is 
authorized to enter into all types of contracts with other Federal 
agencies, including

[[Page 263]]

contracts to furnish equipment, supplies, services, leased real 
property, or materials to them or to perform construction work for them, 
and to contract the performance of these contracts to qualified 
Participants. Where practicable, simplified acquisition procedures 
should be used for 8(a) contracts at or below the simplified acquisition 
threshold. Where appropriate, SBA will delegate the contract execution 
function to procuring activities. In order to receive and retain a 
delegation of SBA's contract execution and review functions, a procuring 
activity must report all 8(a) contract awards, modifications, and 
options to SBA.
    (b) 8(a) contracts may either be sole source awards or awards won 
through competition with other Participants.
    (c) Admission into the 8(a) BD program does not guarantee that a 
Participant will receive 8(a) contracts.
    (d) A requirement for possible award may be identified by SBA, a 
particular Participant or the procuring activity itself. SBA will submit 
the capability statements provided to SBA annually under Sec. 124.403 to 
appropriate procuring activities for the purpose of matching 
requirements with Participants.
    (e) Participants should market their capabilities to appropriate 
procuring activities to increase their prospects of receiving sole 
source 8(a) contracts.
    (f) An 8(a) participant that identifies a requirement that appears 
suitable for award through the 8(a) BD program may request SBA to 
contact the procuring activity to request that the requirement be 
offered to the 8(a) BD program.
    (g) A concern must be a current Participant in the 8(a) BD program 
at the time of award, except as provided in Sec. 124.507(d).
    (h) A Participant must certify that it is a small business under the 
size standard corresponding to the SIC code assigned to each 8(a) 
contract. 8(a) BD program personnel will verify size prior to award of 
an 8(a) contract. If the Participant is not verified as small, it may 
request a formal size determination from the appropriate General 
Contracting Area Office under part 121 of this title.
    (i) Any person or entity that misrepresents its status as a ``small 
business concern owned and controlled by socially and economically 
disadvantaged individuals'' in order to obtain any 8(a) contracting 
opportunity will be subject to possible criminal, civil and 
administrative penalties, including those imposed by section 16(d) of 
the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 645(d).


<R05>
Sec. 124.502  How does an agency offer a procurement to SBA for award through the 8(a) BD program?

    (a) A procuring activity contracting officer indicates his or her 
formal intent to award a procurement requirement as an 8(a) contract by 
submitting a written offering letter to SBA. The procuring activity may 
transmit the offering letter to SBA by electronic mail, if available, or 
by facsimile transmission, as well as by mail or commercial delivery 
service.
    (b) Contracting officers must submit offering letters to the 
following locations:
    (1) For competitive 8(a) requirements and those sole source 
requirements for which no specific Participant is nominated (i.e., open 
requirements) other than construction requirements, to the SBA district 
office serving the geographical area in which the procuring activity is 
located;
    (2) For competitive and open construction requirements, to the SBA 
district office serving the geographical area in which the work is to be 
performed or, in the case of such contracts to be performed overseas, to 
the Office of 8(a) BD located in SBA Headquarters;
    (3) For sole source requirements offered on behalf of a specific 
Participant, to the SBA district office servicing that concern.
    (c) An offering letter must contain the following information:
    (1) A description of the work to be performed;
    (2) The estimated period of performance;
    (3) The SIC code that applies to the principal nature of the 
acquisition;
    (4) The anticipated dollar value of the requirement, including 
options, if any;
    (5) Any special restrictions or geographical limitations on the 
requirement;

[[Page 264]]

    (6) The location of the work to be performed for construction 
procurements;
    (7) Any special capabilities or disciplines needed for contract 
performance;
    (8) The type of contract to be awarded, such as firm fixed price, 
cost reimbursement, or time and materials;
    (9) The acquisition history, if any, of the requirement;
    (10) The names and addresses of any small business contractors which 
have performed on this requirement during the previous 24 months;
    (11) A statement that prior to the offering no solicitation for the 
specific acquisition has been issued as a small business set-aside, or 
as a small disadvantaged business set-aside if applicable, and that no 
other public communication (such as a notice in the Commerce Business 
Daily) has been made showing the procuring activity's clear intent to 
use any of these means of procurement;
    (12) Identification of any specific Participant that the procuring 
activity contracting officer nominates for award of a sole source 8(a) 
contract, if appropriate, including a brief justification for the 
nomination, such as one of the following:
    (i) The Participant, through its own efforts, marketed the 
requirement and caused it to be reserved for the 8(a) BD program; or
    (ii) The acquisition is a follow-on or renewal contract and the 
nominated concern is the incumbent;
    (13) Bonding requirements, if applicable;
    (14) Identification of all Participants which have expressed an 
interest in being considered for the acquisition;
    (15) Identification of all SBA field offices which have requested 
that the requirement be awarded through the 8(a) BD program;
    (16) A request, if appropriate, that a requirement whose estimated 
contract value is under the applicable competitive threshold be awarded 
as an 8(a) competitive contract; and
    (17) Any other information that the procuring activity deems 
relevant or which SBA requests.


<R05>
Sec. 124.503  How does SBA accept a procurement for award through the 8(a) BD program?

    (a) Acceptance of the requirement. Upon receipt of the procuring 
activity's offer of a procurement requirement, SBA will determine 
whether it will accept the requirement for the 8(a) BD program. SBA's 
decision whether to accept the requirement will be sent to the procuring 
activity in writing within 10 working days of receipt of the written 
offering letter if the contract is valued at more than the simplified 
acquisition threshold, and within two days of receipt of the offering 
letter if the contract is valued at or below the simplified acquisition 
threshold, unless SBA requests, and the procuring activity grants, an 
extension. SBA is not required to accept any particular procurement 
offered to the 8(a) BD program.
    (1) Where SBA decides to accept an offering of a sole source 8(a) 
procurement, SBA will accept the offer both on behalf of the 8(a) BD 
program and in support of a specific Participant.
    (2) Where SBA decides to accept an offering of a competitive 8(a) 
procurement, SBA will accept the offer on behalf of the 8(a) BD program.
    (3) Where SBA has delegated its contract execution functions to a 
procuring activity, the procuring activity may assume that SBA accepts 
its offer for the 8(a) program if the procuring activity does not 
receive a reply to its offer within five days.
    (4) In the case of procurement requirements valued at or below the 
Simplified Acquisition Procedures threshold:
    (i) Where a procuring activity makes an offer to the 8(a) program on 
behalf of a specific Program Participant and does not receive a reply to 
its offer within two days, the procuring activity may assume the offer 
is accepted and proceed with award of an 8(a) contract;
    (ii) Where SBA has delegated its 8(a) contract execution functions 
to an agency, SBA may authorize the procuring activity to award an 8(a) 
contract without requiring an offer and acceptance of the requirement 
for the 8(a) program. In such a case, the procuring activity must notify 
SBA of all 8(a) awards made under this authority.

[[Page 265]]

    (5) Where SBA does not respond to an offering letter within the 
normal 10-day time period, the procuring activity may seek SBA's 
acceptance through the AA/8(a)BD. The procuring activity may assume that 
SBA accepts its offer for the 8(a) program if it does not receive a 
reply from the AA/8(a)BD within 5 days of his or her receipt of the 
procuring activity request.
    (b) Verification of SIC code. As part of the acceptance process, SBA 
will verify the appropriateness of the SIC code designation assigned to 
the requirement by the procuring activity contracting officer.
    (1) SBA will accept the SIC code assigned to the requirement by the 
procuring activity contracting officer as long as it is reasonable, even 
though other SIC codes may also be reasonable.
    (2) If SBA and the procuring activity are unable to agree as to the 
proper SIC code designation for the requirement, SBA may either refuse 
to accept the requirement for the 8(a) BD program, appeal the 
contracting officer's determination to the head of the agency pursuant 
to Sec. 124.505, or appeal the SIC code designation to OHA under part 
134 of this title.
    (c) Sole source award where procuring activity nominates a specific 
Participant. SBA will determine whether an appropriate match exists 
where the procuring activity identifies a particular Participant for a 
sole source award.
    (1) Once SBA determines that a procurement is suitable to be 
accepted as an 8(a) sole source contract, SBA will normally accept it on 
behalf of the Participant recommended by the procuring activity, 
provided that:
    (i) The procurement is consistent with the Participant's business 
plan;
    (ii) The Participant complies with its applicable non-8(a) business 
activity target imposed by Sec. 124.509(d);
    (iii) The Participant is small for the size standard corresponding 
to the SIC code assigned to the requirement by the procuring activity 
contracting officer; and
    (iv) The Participant has submitted required financial statements to 
SBA.
    (2) If an appropriate match exists, SBA will advise the procuring 
activity whether SBA will participate in contract negotiations or 
whether SBA will authorize the procuring activity to negotiate directly 
with the identified Participant. Where SBA has delegated its contract 
execution functions to a procuring activity, SBA will also identify that 
delegation in its acceptance letter.
    (3) If an appropriate match does not exist, SBA will notify the 
Participant and the procuring activity, and may then nominate an 
alternate Participant.
    (d) Open requirements. When a procuring activity does not nominate a 
particular concern for performance of a sole source 8(a) contract (open 
requirement), the following additional procedures will apply:
    (1) If the procurement is a construction requirement, SBA will 
examine the portfolio of Participants that have a bona fide place of 
business within the geographical boundaries served by the SBA district 
office where the work is to be performed to select a qualified 
Participant. If none is found to be qualified or a match for a concern 
in that district is determined to be impossible or inappropriate, SBA 
may nominate a Participant with a bona fide place of business within the 
geographical boundaries served by another district office within the 
same state, or may nominate a Participant having a bona fide place of 
business out of state but within a reasonable proximity to the work 
site. SBA's decision will ensure that the nominated Participant is close 
enough to the work site to keep costs of performance reasonable.
    (2) If the procurement is not a construction requirement, SBA may 
select any eligible, responsible Participant nationally to perform the 
contract.
    (3) In cases in which SBA selects a Participant for possible award 
from among two or more eligible and qualified Participants, the 
selection will be based upon relevant factors, including business 
development needs, compliance with competitive business mix requirements 
(if applicable), financial condition, management ability, technical 
capability, and whether award will promote the equitable distribution of 
8(a) contracts.
    (e) Formal technical evaluations. Except for requirements for 
architectural

[[Page 266]]

and engineering services, SBA will not authorize formal technical 
evaluations for sole source 8(a) requirements. A procuring activity:
    (1) Must request that a procurement be a competitive 8(a) award if 
it requires formal technical evaluations of more than one Participant 
for a requirement below the applicable competitive threshold amount; and
    (2) May conduct informal assessments of several Participants' 
capabilities to perform a specific requirement, so long as the statement 
of work for the requirement is not released to any of the Participants 
being assessed.
    (f) Repetitive acquisitions. A procuring activity contracting 
officer must submit a new offering letter to SBA where he or she intends 
to award a follow-on or repetitive contract as an 8(a) award. This 
enables SBA to determine:
    (1) Whether the requirement should be a competitive 8(a) award;
    (2) A nominated firm's eligibility, whether or not it is the same 
firm that performed the previous contract;
    (3) The affect that contract award would have on the equitable 
distribution of 8(a) contracts; and
    (4) Whether the requirement should continue under the 8(a) BD 
program.
    (g) Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs). A Basic Ordering Agreement 
(BOA) is not a contract under the FAR. See 48 CFR 16.703(a). Each order 
to be issued under the BOA is an individual contract. As such, the 
procuring activity must offer, and SBA must accept, each task order 
under a BOA in addition to offering and accepting the BOA itself.
    (1) SBA will not accept for award on a sole source basis any task 
order under a BOA that would cause the total dollar amount of task 
orders issued to exceed the applicable competitive threshold amount set 
forth in Sec. 124.506(a).
    (2) Where a procuring activity believes that task orders to be 
issued under a proposed BOA will exceed the applicable competitive 
threshold amount set forth in Sec. 124.506(a), the procuring activity 
must offer the requirement to the program to be competed among eligible 
Participants.
    (3) Once a concern's program term expires, the concern otherwise 
exits the 8(a) BD program, or becomes other than small for the SIC code 
assigned under the BOA, new orders will not be accepted for the concern.
    (h) Multiple Award and Federal Supply Schedule Contracts. Unlike 
Basic Ordering Agreements, Multiple Award and Federal Supply Schedule 
contracts are contracts. Orders issued under these contracts are not 
considered separate contracts. As such, SBA's acceptance of the original 
Multiple Award or Federal Supply Schedule contract is valid for the 
duration of the contract. Separate offers and acceptances will not be 
made for individual task orders under these contracts.
    (1) Task orders are not required to be competed where the value of 
the task order will exceed the competitive threshold as long as the 
original contract was competed.
    (2) A concern may continue to accept new orders under a Multiple 
Award or Federal Supply Schedule contract even where a concern's program 
term expires, the concern otherwise exits the 8(a) BD program, or the 
concern becomes other than small for the SIC code assigned under the 
contract subsequent to award of the contract.
    (i) Requirements where SBA has delegated contract execution 
authority. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, 
where SBA has delegated its 8(a) contract execution authority to the 
procuring activity, the procuring activity must still offer and SBA must 
still accept all requirements intended to be awarded as 8(a) contracts.


<R05>
Sec. 124.504  What circumstances limit SBA's ability to accept a procurement for award as an 8(a) contract?

    SBA will not accept a procurement for award as an 8(a) contract if 
the circumstances identified in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this 
section exist.
    (a) Reservation as small business or SDB set-aside. The procuring 
activity issued a solicitation for or otherwise expressed publicly a 
clear intent to reserve the procurement as a small business or small 
disadvantaged business (SDB) set-aside prior to offering the requirement 
to SBA for award as an 8(a) contract. The AA/8(a)BD may permit the 
acceptance of the requirement,

[[Page 267]]

however, under extraordinary circumstances.

    Example to paragraph (a). SBA may accept a requirement where a 
procuring activity made a decision to offer the requirement to the 8(a) 
BD program before the solicitation was sent out and the procuring 
activity acknowledges and documents that the solicitation was in error.

    (b) Competition prior to offer and acceptance. The procuring 
activity competed a requirement among Participants prior to offering the 
requirement to SBA and receiving SBA's formal acceptance of the 
requirement.
    (1) Any competition conducted without first obtaining SBA's formal 
acceptance of the procurement for the 8(a) BD program will not be 
considered an 8(a) competitive requirement.
    (2) SBA may accept the requirement for the 8(a) BD program as a 
competitive 8(a) requirement, but only if the procuring activity agrees 
to resolicit the requirement using appropriate competitive 8(a) 
procedures.
    (c) Adverse impact. SBA has made a written determination that 
acceptance of the procurement for 8(a) award would have an adverse 
impact on an individual small business, a group of small businesses 
located in a specific geographical location, or other small business 
programs. The adverse impact concept is designed to protect small 
business concerns which are performing Government contracts awarded 
outside the 8(a) BD program, and does not apply to follow-on or renewal 
8(a) acquisitions. SBA will not consider adverse impact with respect to 
any requirement offered to the 8(a) program under Simplified Acquisition 
Procedures.
    (1) In determining whether the acceptance of a requirement would 
have an adverse impact on an individual small business, SBA will 
consider all relevant factors.
    (i) In connection with a specific small business, SBA presumes 
adverse impact to exist where:
    (A) The small business concern has performed the specific 
requirement for at least 24 months;
    (B) The small business is performing the requirement at the time it 
is offered to the 8(a) BD program, or its performance of the requirement 
ended within 30 days of the procuring activity's offer of the 
requirement to the 8(a) BD program; and
    (C) The dollar value of the requirement that the small business is 
or was performing is 25 percent or more of its most recent annual gross 
sales (including those of its affiliates). For a multi-year requirement, 
the dollar value of the last 12 months of the requirement will be used 
to determine whether a small business would be adversely affected by 
SBA's acceptance.
    (ii) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, adverse 
impact does not apply to ``new'' requirements. A new requirement is one 
which has not been previously procured by the relevant procuring 
activity.
    (A) Where a requirement is new, no small business could have 
previously performed the requirement and, thus, SBA's acceptance of the 
requirement for the 8(a) BD program will not adversely impact any small 
business.
    (B) Construction contracts, by their very nature (e.g., the building 
of a specific structure), are deemed new requirements.
    (C) The expansion or modification of an existing requirement will be 
considered a new requirement where the magnitude of change is 
significant enough to cause a price adjustment of at least 25 percent 
(adjusted for inflation) or to require significant additional or 
different types of capabilities or work.
    (D) SBA need not perform an impact determination where a new 
requirement is offered to the 8(a) BD program.
    (2) In determining whether the acceptance of a requirement would 
have an adverse impact on a group of small businesses, SBA will consider 
the effects of combining or consolidating various requirements being 
performed by two or more small business concerns into a single contract 
which would be considered a ``new'' requirement as compared to any of 
the previous smaller requirements. SBA may find adverse impact to exist 
if one of the existing small business contractors meets the presumption 
set forth in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.
    (3) In determining whether the acceptance of a requirement would 
have an adverse impact on other small business programs, SBA will 
consider all

[[Page 268]]

relevant factors, including but not limited to, the number and value of 
contracts in the subject industry reserved for the 8(a) BD program as 
compared with other small business programs.
    (d) Benchmark achievement. Where actual participation by 
disadvantaged businesses in a SIC Major Group exceeds the benchmark 
limitations established by the Department of Commerce for that Major 
Group, SBA may elect not to accept a requirement having a SIC code 
within the Major Group that is offered to SBA for award as an 8(a) 
contract. In determining whether to accept a requirement in such a case, 
SBA will consider the developmental needs of Participants and other 
anticipated contracting opportunities available to them.
    (e) Release for non-8(a) competition. In limited instances, SBA may 
decline to accept the offer of a follow-on or renewal 8(a) acquisition 
to give a concern previously awarded the contract that is leaving or has 
left the 8(a) BD program the opportunity to compete for the requirement 
outside the 8(a) BD program.
    (1) SBA will consider release only where:
    (i) The procurement awarded through the 8(a) BD program is being or 
was performed by either a Participant whose program term will expire 
prior to contract completion, or, by a former Participant whose program 
term expired within one year of the date of the offering letter;
    (ii) The concern requests in writing that SBA decline to accept the 
offer prior to SBA's acceptance of the requirement for award as an 8(a) 
contract; and
    (iii) The concern qualifies as a small business for the requirement 
now offered to the 8(a) BD program.
    (2) In considering release, SBA will balance the importance of the 
requirement to the concern's business development needs against the 
business development needs of other Participants that are qualified to 
perform the requirement. This determination will include consideration 
of whether rejection of the requirement would seriously reduce the pool 
of similar types of contracts available for award as 8(a) contracts. SBA 
will seek the views of the procuring activity.
    (3) If SBA declines to accept the offer and releases the 
requirement, it will recommend to the procuring activity that the 
requirement be procured as a small business or, if authorized, an SDB 
set-aside.

Sec. 124.505  When will SBA appeal the terms or conditions of a particular 8(a) contract or a procuring activity decision not to reserve a requirement for the 
          8(a) BD program?

    (a) What SBA may appeal. The Administrator of SBA may appeal the 
following matters to the head of the procuring agency:
    (1) A contracting officer's decision not to make a particular 
procurement available for award as an 8(a) contract;
    (2) A contracting officer's decision to reject a specific 
Participant for award of an 8(a) contract after SBA's acceptance of the 
requirement for the 8(a) BD program; and
    (3) The terms and conditions of a proposed 8(a) contract, including 
the procuring activity's SIC code designation and estimate of the fair 
market price.
    (b) Procedures for appeal. (1) SBA must notify the contracting 
officer of the SBA Administrator's intent to appeal an adverse decision 
within 5 working days of SBA's receipt of the decision.
    (2) Upon receipt of the notice of intent to appeal, the procuring 
activity must suspend further action regarding the procurement until the 
head of the procuring agency issues a written decision on the appeal, 
unless the head of the procuring agency makes a written determination 
that urgent and compelling circumstances which significantly affect 
interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a 
consideration of the appeal.
    (3) The SBA Administrator must send a written appeal of the adverse 
decision to the head of the procuring agency within 15 working days of 
SBA's notification of intent to appeal or the appeal may be considered 
withdrawn.
    (4) By statute (15 U.S.C. 637(a)(1)(A)), the procuring agency head 
must specify in writing the reasons for a denial of

[[Page 269]]

an appeal brought by the Administrator under this section.


<R05>
Sec. 124.506  At what dollar threshold must an 8(a) procurement be competed among eligible Participants?

    (a) Competitive thresholds. (1) A procurement offered and accepted 
for the 8(a) BD program must be competed among eligible Participants if:
    (i) There is a reasonable expectation that at least two eligible 
Participants will submit offers at a fair market price;
    (ii) The anticipated award price of the contract, including options, 
will exceed $5,000,000 for contracts assigned manufacturing SIC codes 
and $3,000,000 for all other contracts; and
    (iii) The requirement has not been accepted by SBA for award as a 
sole source 8(a) procurement on behalf of a tribally-owned or ANC-owned 
concern.
    (2) For all types of contracts, the applicable competitive threshold 
amounts will be applied to the procuring activity estimate of the total 
value of the contract, including all options. For indefinite delivery or 
indefinite quantity type contracts, the thresholds are applied to the 
maximum order amount authorized.
    (3) Where the estimate of the total value of a proposed 8(a) 
contract is less than the applicable competitive threshold amount and 
the requirement is accepted as a sole source requirement on that basis, 
award may be made even though the contract price arrived at through 
negotiations exceeds the competitive threshold, provided that the 
contract price is not more than ten percent greater than the competitive 
threshold amount.

    Example to paragraph (a)(3). If the anticipated award price for a 
professional services requirement is determined to be $2.7 million and 
it is accepted as a sole source 8(a) requirement on that basis, a sole 
source award will be valid even if the contract price arrived at after 
negotiation is $3.1 million.

    (4) A proposed 8(a) requirement with an estimated value exceeding 
the applicable competitive threshold amount may not be divided into 
several separate procurement actions for lesser amounts in order to use 
8(a) sole source procedures to award to a single contractor.
    (b) Exemption from competitive thresholds for Participants owned by 
Indian tribes. SBA may award a sole source 8(a) contract to a 
Participant concern owned and controlled by an Indian tribe or an ANC 
where the anticipated value of the procurement exceeds the applicable 
competitive threshold if SBA has not accepted the requirement into the 
8(a) BD program as a competitive procurement. There is no requirement 
that a procurement must be competed whenever possible before it can be 
accepted on a sole source basis for a tribally-owned or ANC-owned 
concern, but a procurement may not be removed from competition to award 
it to a tribally-owned or ANC-owned concern on a sole source basis.
    (c) Competition below thresholds. The AA/8(a)BD, on a nondelegable 
basis, may approve a request from a procuring activity to compete a 
requirement that is below the applicable competitive threshold amount 
among eligible Participants.
    (1) This authority will be used primarily when technical 
competitions are appropriate or when a large number of potential 
awardees exist.
    (2) The AA/8(a)BD may consider whether the procuring activity has 
made and will continue to make available a significant number of its 
contracts to the 8(a) BD program on a noncompetitive basis.
    (3) The AA/8(a)BD may deny a request if the procuring activity 
previously offered the requirement to the 8(a) BD program on a 
noncompetitive basis and the request is made following the inability of 
the procuring activity and the potential sole source awardee to reach an 
agreement on price or some other material term or condition.
    (d) Sole source above thresholds. Where a contract opportunity 
exceeds the applicable threshold amount and there is not a reasonable 
expectation that at least two eligible 8(a) Participants will submit 
offers at a fair price, the AA/8(a)BD may accept the requirement for a 
sole source 8(a) award if he or she determines that an eligible 
Participant in the 8(a) portfolio is capable of performing the 
requirement at a fair price.

[[Page 270]]


<R05>
Sec. 124.507  What procedures apply to competitive 8(a) procurements?

    (a) FAR procedures. Procuring activities will conduct competitions 
among and evaluate offers received from Participants in accordance with 
the Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR, chapter 1).
    (b) Eligibility determination by SBA. In either a negotiated or 
sealed bid competitive 8(a) acquisition, the procuring activity will 
request that the SBA district office servicing the apparent successful 
offeror determine that firm's eligibility for award.
    (1) Within 5 working days after receipt of a procuring activity's 
request for an eligibility determination, SBA will determine whether the 
firm identified by the procuring activity is eligible for award.
    (2) Eligibility is based on 8(a) BD program criteria, including 
whether the Participant is:
    (i) A small business under the SIC code assigned to the requirement;
    (ii) In compliance with any applicable competitive business mix 
target established or remedial measure imposed by Sec. 124.509 that does 
not include the denial of future 8(a) contracts;
    (iii) In the developmental stage of program participation if the 
solicitation restricts offerors to the developmental stage of 
participation; and
    (iv) A concern with a bona fide place of business in the applicable 
geographic area if the procurement is for construction.
    (3) If SBA determines that the apparent successful offeror is 
ineligible, SBA will notify the procuring activity. The procuring 
activity will then send to SBA the identity of the next highest 
evaluated firm for an eligibility determination. The process is repeated 
until SBA determines that an identified offeror is eligible for award.
    (4) Except to the extent set forth in paragraph (d) of this section, 
SBA determines whether a Participant is eligible for a specific 8(a) 
competitive requirement as of the date that the Participant submitted 
its initial offer which includes price.
    (5) If the procuring activity contracting officer believes that the 
apparent successful offeror is not responsible to perform the contract, 
he or she must refer the concern to SBA for a possible Certificate of 
Competency in accord with Sec. 125.5 of this title.
    (c) Restricted competition. (1) Competition within stages of program 
participation. SBA may accept a competitive 8(a) requirement that is 
limited to Participants in the developmental stage of program 
participation, or may accept a requirement to be competed among firms 
both in the developmental and transitional stages of program 
participation.
    (2) Construction competitions. Based on its knowledge of the 8(a) BD 
portfolio, SBA will determine whether a competitive 8(a) construction 
requirement should be competed among only those Participants having a 
bona fide place of business within the geographical boundaries of one or 
more SBA district offices, within a state, or within the state and 
nearby areas. Only those Participants with bona fide places of business 
within the appropriate geographical boundaries are eligible to submit 
offers.
    (3) Competition for all non-construction requirements. Except for 
construction requirements, all eligible Participants regardless of 
location may submit offers in response to competitive 8(a) 
solicitations. The only geographic restrictions pertaining to 8(a) 
competitive requirements, other than those for construction 
requirements, are any imposed by the solicitations themselves.
    (d) Award to firms whose program terms have expired. A concern that 
has completed its term of participation in the 8(a) BD program may be 
awarded a competitive 8(a) contract if it was a Participant eligible for 
award of the contract on the initial date specified for receipt of 
offers contained in the contract solicitation, and if it continues to 
meet all other applicable eligibility criteria.
    (1) Amendments to the solicitation extending the date for 
submissions of offers will be disregarded.
    (2) For a negotiated procurement, a Participant may submit revised 
offers, including a best and final offer, and be awarded a competitive 
8(a) contract if it was eligible as of the initial date specified for 
the receipt of offers in the solicitation, even though its program term 
may expire after that date.

[[Page 271]]


<R05>
Sec. 124.508  How is an 8(a) contract executed?

    (a) An 8(a) contract can be awarded in the following ways:
    (1) As a tripartite agreement in which the procuring activity, SBA 
and the Participant all sign the appropriate contract documents. There 
may be separate prime and subcontract documents (i.e., a prime contract 
between the procuring activity and SBA and a subcontract between SBA and 
the selected 8(a) concern) or a combined contract document representing 
both the prime and subcontract relationships; or
    (2) Where SBA has delegated contract execution authority to the 
procuring activity, directly by the procuring activity through a 
contract between the procuring activity and the Participant.
    (b) Where SBA receives a contract for signature valued at or below 
the simplified acquisition threshold, it will sign the contract and 
return it to the procuring activity within three (3) days of receipt.
    (c) In order to be eligible to receive a sole source 8(a) contract, 
a firm must be a current Participant on the date of award. (See 
Sec. 124.507(d) for competitive 8(a) awards.)


<R05>
Sec. 124.509  What are non-8(a) business activity targets?

    (a) General. (1) To ensure that Participants do not develop an 
unreasonable reliance on 8(a) awards, and to ease their transition into 
the competitive marketplace after graduating from the 8(a) BD program, 
Participants must make maximum efforts to obtain business outside the 
8(a) BD program.
    (2) During both the developmental and transitional stages of the 
8(a) BD program, a Participant must make substantial and sustained 
efforts, including following a reasonable marketing strategy, to attain 
the targeted dollar levels of non-8(a) revenue established in its 
business plan. It must attempt to use the 8(a) BD program as a resource 
to strengthen the firm for economic viability when program benefits are 
no longer available.
    (b) Required non-8(a) business activity targets during transitional 
stage. (1) General. During the transitional stage of the 8(a) BD 
program, a Participant must achieve certain targets of non-8(a) contract 
revenue (i.e., revenue from other than sole source or competitive 8(a) 
contracts). These targets are called non-8(a) business activity targets 
and are expressed as a percentage of total revenue. The targets call for 
an increase in non-8(a) revenue over time.
    (2) Non-8(a) business activity targets. During their transitional 
stage of program participation, Participants must meet the following 
non-8(a) business activity targets each year:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                       Non-8(a) business
                                                        activity targets
                                                       (required minimum
     Participant's year in the transitional stage       non-8(a) revenue
                                                        as a percentage
                                                       of total revenue)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1....................................................                 15
2....................................................                 25
3....................................................                 35
4....................................................                 45
5....................................................                 55
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) Compliance with non-8(a) business activity targets. SBA will 
measure the Participant's compliance with the applicable non-8(a) 
business activity target at the end of each program year in the 
transitional stage based on the Participant's latest fiscal year-end 
total revenue. Thus, at the end of the first year in the transitional 
stage of program participation, SBA will compare the Participant's non-
8(a) revenue to its total revenue during that first year. If 
appropriate, SBA will require remedial measures during the subsequent 
program year. Thus, for example, non-compliance with the required non-
8(a) business activity target in year one of the transitional stage 
would cause SBA to initiate remedial measures under paragraph (d) of 
this section for year two in the transitional stage.
    (4) Certification of compliance. A Participant must certify as part 
of its offer that it complies with the applicable non-8(a) business 
activity target or with the measures imposed by SBA under paragraph (d) 
of this section before it can receive any 8(a) contract during the 
transitional stage of the 8(a) BD program.
    (c) Reporting and verification of business activity. (1) Once 
admitted to the 8(a) BD program, a Participant must provide to SBA as 
part of its annual review:

[[Page 272]]

    (i) Annual financial statements with a breakdown of 8(a) and non-
8(a) revenue in accord with Sec. 124.602; and
    (ii) An annual report within 30 days from the end of the program 
year of all non-8(a) contracts, options, and modifications affecting 
price executed during the program year.
    (2) At the end of each year of participation in the transitional 
stage, the BOS assigned to work with the Participant will review the 
Participant's total revenues to determine whether the non-8(a) revenues 
have met the applicable target. In determining compliance, SBA will 
compare all 8(a) revenues received during the year, including those from 
options and modifications, to all non-8(a) revenues received during the 
year.
    (d) Consequences of not meeting competitive business mix targets. 
(1) Except as set forth in paragraph (e) of this section, beginning at 
the end of the first year in the transitional stage (the fifth year of 
participation in the 8(a) BD program), any firm that does not meet its 
applicable competitive business mix target for the just completed 
program year will be ineligible for sole source 8(a) contracts in the 
current program year, unless and until the Participant corrects the 
situation as described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
    (2) If SBA determines that an 8(a) Participant has failed to meet 
its applicable competitive business mix target during any program year 
in the transitional stage of program participation, SBA may increase its 
monitoring of the Participant's contracting activity during the ensuing 
program year. SBA will also notify the Participant in writing that the 
Participant will not be eligible for further 8(a) sole source contract 
awards until it has demonstrated to SBA that it has complied with its 
non-8(a) business activity requirements as described in paragraphs 
(d)(2)(i) and (d)(2)(ii) of this section. In order for a Participant to 
come into compliance with the non-8(a) business activity target and be 
eligible for further 8(a) sole source contracts, it may:
    (i) Wait until the end of the current program year and demonstrate 
to SBA as part of the normal annual review process that it has met the 
revised non-8(a) business activity target; or
    (ii) At its option, submit information regarding its non-8(a) 
revenue to SBA quarterly throughout the current program year in an 
attempt to come into compliance before the end of the current program 
year. If the Participant satisfies the requirements of paragraphs 
(d)(2)(ii)(A) or (d)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, SBA will reinstate the 
Participant's ability to get sole source 8(a) contracts prior to its 
annual review.
    (A) To qualify for reinstatement during the first six months of the 
current program year (i.e., at either the first or second quarterly 
review), the Participant must demonstrate that it has received non-8(a) 
revenue and new non-8(a) contract awards that are equal to or greater 
than the dollar amount by which it failed to meet its non-8(a) business 
activity target for the just completed program year. For this purpose, 
SBA will not count options on existing non-8(a) contracts in determining 
whether a Participant has received new non-8(a) contract awards.
    (B) To qualify for reinstatement during the last six months of the 
current program year (i.e., at either the nine-month or one year 
review), the Participant must demonstrate that it has achieved its non-
8(a) business activity target as of that point in the current program 
year.

    Example 1 to paragraph (d)(2). Firm A had $10 million in total 
revenue during year 2 in the transitional stage (year 6 in the program), 
but failed to meet the minimum non-8(a) business activity target of 25 
percent. It had 8(a) revenues of $8.5 million and non-8(a) revenues of 
$1.5 million (15 percent). Based on total revenues of $10 million, Firm 
A should have had at least $2.5 million in non-8(a) revenues. Thus, Firm 
A missed its target by $1 million (its target ($2.5 million) minus its 
actual non-8(a) revenues ($1.5 million)). Because Firm A did not achieve 
its non-8(a) business activity target, it cannot receive 8(a) sole 
source awards until correcting that situation. The firm may wait until 
the next annual review to establish that it has met the revised target, 
or it can choose to report contract awards and other non-8(a) revenue to 
SBA quarterly. Firm A elects to submit information to SBA quarterly in 
year 3 of the transitional stage (year 7 in the program). In order to be 
eligible for sole source 8(a) contracts after either its 3 month or 6

[[Page 273]]

month review, Firm A must show that it has received non-8(a) revenue 
and/or been awarded new non-8(a) contracts totaling $1 million (the 
amount by which it missed its target in year 2 of the transitional 
stage).
    Example 2 to paragraph (d)(2). Firm B had $10 million in total 
revenue during year 2 in the transitional stage (year 6 in the program), 
of which $8.5 million were 8(a) revenues and $1.5 million were non-8(a) 
revenues. At its first two quarterly reviews during year 3 of the 
transitional stage (year 7 in the program), Firm B could not demonstrate 
that it had received at least $1 million in non-8(a) revenue and new 
non-8(a) awards. In order to be eligible for sole source 8(a) contracts 
after its 9 month or 1 year review, Firm B must show that at least 35% 
(the non-8(a) business activity target for year 3 in the transitional 
stage) of all revenues received during year 3 in the transitional stage 
as of that point are from non-8(a) sources.

    (3) In determining whether a Participant has achieved its required 
non-8(a) business activity target at the end of any program year in the 
transitional stage, or whether a Participant that failed to meet the 
target for the previous program year has achieved the required level of 
non-8(a) business at its nine-month review, SBA will measure 8(a) 
support by adding the base year value of all 8(a) contracts awarded 
during the applicable program year to the value of all options and 
modifications executed during that year.
    (4) As a condition of eligibility for new 8(a) contracts, SBA may 
also impose other requirements on a Participant that fails to achieve 
the non-8(a) business activity targets. These include requiring the 
Participant to obtain management assistance, technical assistance, and/
or counseling, and/or attend seminars relating to management assistance, 
business development, financing, marketing, accounting, or proposal 
preparation.
    (5) SBA may initiate proceedings to terminate a Participant from the 
8(a) BD program where the firm makes no good faith efforts to obtain 
non-8(a) revenues.
    (e) Waiver of sole source prohibition. (1) The AA/8(a)BD, or his or 
her designee, may waive the requirement prohibiting a Participant from 
receiving further sole source 8(a) contracts when a Participant does not 
meet its non-8(a) business activity target where a denial of a sole 
source contract would cause severe economic hardship on the Participant 
so that the Participant's survival may be jeopardized, or where 
extenuating circumstances beyond the Participant's control caused the 
Participant not to meet its non-8(a) business activity target. The 
decision to grant or deny a request for a waiver is at SBA's discretion, 
and no appeal may be taken with respect to that decision.
    (2) The SBA Administrator on a non-delegable basis may waive the 
requirement prohibiting a Participant from receiving further sole source 
8(a) contracts when the Participant does not meet its non-8(a) business 
activity target where the head of a procuring activity represents to the 
SBA Administrator that award of a sole source 8(a) contract to the 
Participant is needed to achieve significant interests of the 
Government.


<R05>
Sec. 124.510  What percentage of work must a Participant perform on an 8(a) contract?

    (a) To assist the business development of Participants in the 8(a) 
BD program, an 8(a) contractor must perform certain percentages of work 
with its own employees. These percentages and the requirements relating 
to them are the same as those established for small business set-aside 
prime contractors, and are set forth in Sec. 125.6 of this title.
    (b) A Participant must certify in its offer that it will meet the 
applicable percentage of work requirement. SBA will determine whether 
the firm will be in compliance as of the date of award of the contract 
for both sealed bid and negotiated procurements.
    (c) Indefinite quantity contracts. (1) In order to ensure that the 
required percentage of costs on an indefinite quantity 8(a) award is 
performed by the Participant, the Participant must demonstrate 
semiannually that it has performed the required percentage to that date. 
For a service or supply contract, this does not mean that the 
Participant must perform 50 percent of the applicable costs for each 
task order with its own force, or that a Participant must have performed 
50 percent of the applicable costs at any point in time during the 
contract's life. Rather, the Participant must perform 50 percent of

[[Page 274]]

the applicable costs for the combined total of all task orders issued to 
date at six month intervals.

    Example to paragraph (c)(1). Two task orders are issued under an 
8(a) indefinite quantity service contract during the first six months of 
the contract. If $100,000 in personnel costs are incurred on the first 
task order, 90% of those costs ($90,000) are incurred for performance by 
the Participant's own work force, and the second task order also 
requires $100,000 in personnel costs, the Participant would have to 
perform only 10 percent of the personnel costs on the second task order 
because it would still have performed 50% of the total personnel costs 
at the end of the six-month period ($100,000 out of $200,000).

    (2) Where there is a guaranteed minimum condition in an indefinite 
quantity 8(a) award, the required performance of work percentage need 
not be met on task orders issued during the first six months of the 
contract. In such a case, however, the percentage of work that a 
Participant may further contract to other concerns during the first six 
months of the contract may not exceed 50 percent of the total guaranteed 
minimum dollar value to be provided by the contract. Once the guaranteed 
minimum amount is met, the general rule for indefinite quantity 
contracts set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section applies.

    Example to paragraph (c)(2). Where a contract guarantees a minimum 
of $100,000 in professional services and the first task order is for 
$60,000 in such services, the Participant may perform as little as 
$10,000 of the personnel costs for that order. In such a case, however, 
the Participant must perform all of the next task order(s) up to $40,000 
to ensure that it performs 50% of the $100,000 guaranteed minimum 
($10,000 + $40,000 = $50,000 or 50% of the $100,000).

    (3) The applicable SBA District Director may waive the provisions in 
paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section requiring a Participant to 
meet the applicable performance of work requirement at the end of any 
six-month period where he or she makes a written determination that 
larger amounts of subcontracting are essential during certain stages of 
performance, provided that there are written assurances from both the 
Participant and the procuring activity that the contract will ultimately 
comply with the requirements of this section. Where SBA authorizes a 
Participant to exceed the subcontracting limitations and the Participant 
does not ultimately comply with the performance of work requirements by 
the end of the contract, SBA will not grant future waivers for the 
Participant.


<R05>
Sec. 124.511  How is fair market price determined for an 8(a) contract?

    (a) The procuring activity determines what constitutes a ``fair 
market price'' for an 8(a) contract.
    (1) The procuring activity must derive the estimate of a current 
fair market price for a new requirement, or a requirement that does not 
have a satisfactory procurement history, from a price or cost analysis. 
This analysis may take into account prevailing market conditions, 
commercial prices for similar products or services, or data obtained 
from any other agency. The analysis must also consider any cost or 
pricing data that is timely submitted by SBA.
    (2) The procuring activity must base the estimate of a current fair 
market price for a requirement that has a satisfactory procurement 
history on recent award prices adjusted to ensure comparability. 
Adjustments will take into account differences in quantities, 
performance, times, plans, specifications, transportation costs, 
packaging and packing costs, labor and material costs, overhead costs, 
and any other additional costs which may be appropriate.
    (b) Upon the request of SBA, a procuring activity will provide to 
SBA a written statement detailing the method it has used to estimate the 
current fair market price for the 8(a) requirement. This statement must 
be submitted within 10 working days of SBA's request. The procuring 
activity must identify the information, studies, analyses, and other 
data it used in making its estimate.
    (c) The procuring activity's estimate of fair market price and any 
supporting data may not be disclosed by SBA to any Participant or 
potential contractor.
    (d) The concern selected to perform an 8(a) contract may request SBA 
to protest the procuring activity's estimate of current fair market 
price to

[[Page 275]]

the Secretary of the Department or head of the agency in accordance with 
Sec. 124.505.


<R05>
Sec. 124.512  Delegation of contract administration to procuring agencies.

    (a) SBA may delegate, by the use of special clauses in the 8(a) 
contract documents or by a separate agreement with the procuring 
activity, all responsibilities for administering an 8(a) contract to the 
procuring activity except the approval of novation agreements under 48 
CFR 42.302(a)(25).
    (b) This delegation of contract administration authorizes a 
contracting officer to execute any priced option or in scope 
modification without SBA's concurrence. The contracting officer must, 
however, notify SBA of all modifications and options exercised.


<R05>
Sec. 124.513  Under what circumstances can a joint venture be awarded an 8(a) contract?

    (a) General. (1) If approved by SBA, a Participant may enter into a 
joint venture agreement with one or more other small business concerns, 
whether or not 8(a) Participants, for the purpose of performing a 
specific 8(a) contract.
    (2) A joint venture agreement is permissible only where an 8(a) 
concern lacks the necessary capacity to perform the contract on its own, 
and the agreement is fair and equitable and will be of substantial 
benefit to the 8(a) concern. However, where SBA concludes that an 8(a) 
concern brings very little to the joint venture relationship in terms of 
resources and expertise other than its 8(a) status, SBA will not approve 
the joint venture arrangement.
    (b) Size of concerns to an 8(a) joint venture. (1) A joint venture 
of at least one 8(a) Participant and one or more other business concerns 
may submit an offer as a small business for a competitive 8(a) 
procurement so long as each concern is small under the size standard 
corresponding to the SIC code assigned to the contract, provided:
    (i) The size of at least one 8(a) Participant to the joint venture 
is less than one half the size standard corresponding to the SIC code 
assigned to the contract; and
    (ii)(A) For a procurement having a revenue-based size standard, the 
procurement exceeds half the size standard corresponding to the SIC code 
assigned to the contract; or
    (B) For a procurement having an employee-based size standard, the 
procurement exceeds $10 million;
    (2) For sole source and competitive 8(a) procurements that do not 
exceed the dollar levels identified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, 
an 8(a) Participant entering into a joint venture agreement with another 
concern is considered to be affiliated for size purposes with the other 
concern with respect to performance of the 8(a) contract. The combined 
annual receipts or employees of the concerns entering into the joint 
venture must meet the size standard for the SIC code assigned to the 
8(a) contract.
    (3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) 
of this section, a joint venture between a protege firm and its approved 
mentor (see Sec. 124.520) will be deemed small provided the protege 
qualifies as small for the size standard corresponding to the SIC code 
assigned to the procurement and has not reached the dollar limit set 
forth in Sec. 124.519.
    (c) Contents of joint venture agreement. Every joint venture 
agreement to perform an 8(a) contract, including those between mentors 
and proteges authorized by Sec. 124.520, must contain a provision:
    (1) Setting forth the purpose of the joint venture;
    (2) Designating an 8(a) Participant as the managing venturer of the 
joint venture, and an employee of the managing venturer as the project 
manager responsible for performance of the 8(a) contract;
    (3) Stating that not less than 51 percent of the net profits earned 
by the joint venture will be distributed to the 8(a) Participant(s);
    (4) Providing for the establishment and administration of a special 
bank account in the name of the joint venture. This account must require 
the signature of all parties to the joint venture or designees for 
withdrawal purposes. All payments due the joint venture for performance 
on an 8(a) contract will be deposited in the special account; all 
expenses incurred under

[[Page 276]]

the contract will be paid from the account as well;
    (5) Itemizing all major equipment, facilities, and other resources 
to be furnished by each party to the joint venture, with a detailed 
schedule of cost or value of each;
    (6) Specifying the responsibilities of the parties with regard to 
contract performance, source of labor and negotiation of the 8(a) 
contract;
    (7) Obligating all parties to the joint venture to ensure 
performance of the 8(a) contract and to complete performance despite the 
withdrawal of any member;
    (8) Designating that accounting and other administrative records 
relating to the joint venture be kept in the office of the managing 
venturer, unless approval to keep them elsewhere is granted by the 
District Director or his/her designee upon written request;
    (9) Requiring the final original records be retained by the managing 
venturer upon completion of the 8(a) contract performed by the joint 
venture;
    (10) Stating that quarterly financial statements showing cumulative 
contract receipts and expenditures (including salaries of the joint 
venture's principals) must be submitted to SBA not later than 45 days 
after each operating quarter of the joint venture; and
    (11) Stating that a project-end profit and loss statement, including 
a statement of final profit distribution, must be submitted to SBA no 
later than 90 days after completion of the contract.
    (d) Performance of work. For any 8(a) contract, including those 
between mentors and proteges authorized by Sec. 124.520, the joint 
venture must perform the applicable percentage of work required by 
Sec. 124.510, and the 8(a) partner(s) to the joint venture must perform 
a significant portion of the contract.
    (e) Prior approval by SBA. SBA must approve a joint venture 
agreement prior to the award of an 8(a) contract on behalf of the joint 
venture.
    (f) Contract execution. Where SBA has approved a joint venture, the 
procuring activity will execute an 8(a) contract in the name of the 
joint venture entity.
    (g) Amendments to joint venture agreement. All amendments to the 
joint venture agreement must be approved by SBA.
    (h) Inspection of records. SBA may inspect the records of the joint 
venture without notice at any time deemed necessary.


<R05>
Sec. 124.514  Exercise of 8(a) options and modifications.

    (a) Unpriced options. The exercise of an unpriced option is 
considered to be a new contracting action.
    (1) If a concern has graduated or been terminated from the 8(a) BD 
program or is no longer small under the size standard corresponding to 
the SIC code for the requirement, negotiations to price the option 
cannot be entered into and the option cannot be exercised.
    (2) If the concern is still a Participant and otherwise eligible for 
the requirement on a sole source basis, the procuring activity 
contracting officer may negotiate price and exercise the option provided 
the option, considered a new contracting action, meets all regulatory 
requirements, including the procuring activity's offering and SBA's 
acceptance of the requirement for the 8(a) BD program.
    (3) If the estimated fair market price of the option exceeds the 
applicable threshold amount set forth in Sec. 124.506, the requirement 
must be competed as a new contract among eligible Participants.
    (b) Priced options. The procuring activity contracting officer may 
exercise a priced option to an 8(a) contract whether the concern that 
received the award has graduated or been terminated from the 8(a) BD 
program or is no longer eligible if to do so is in the best interests of 
the Government.
    (c) Modifications beyond the scope. A modification beyond the scope 
of the initial 8(a) contract award is considered to be a new contracting 
action. It will be treated the same as an unpriced option as described 
in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (d) Modifications within the scope. The procuring activity 
contracting officer may exercise a modification within the scope of the 
initial 8(a) contract whether the concern that received the award has 
graduated or been terminated from

[[Page 277]]

the 8(a) BD program or is no longer eligible if to do so is in the best 
interests of the Government.


<R05>
Sec. 124.515  Can a Participant change its ownership or control and continue to perform an 8(a) contract, and can it transfer performance to another firm?

    (a) An 8(a) contract must be performed by the Participant that 
initially received it unless a waiver is granted under paragraph (b) of 
this section.
    (1) An 8(a) contract, whether in the base or an option year, must be 
terminated for the convenience of the Government if:
    (i) One or more of the individuals upon whom eligibility for the 
8(a) BD program was based relinquishes or enters into any agreement to 
relinquish ownership or control of the Participant such that the 
Participant would no longer be controlled or at least 51% owned by 
disadvantaged individuals; or
    (ii) The contract is transferred or novated for any reason to 
another firm.
    (2) The procuring activity may not assess repurchase costs or other 
damages against the Participant due solely to the provisions of this 
section.
    (b) The SBA Administrator may waive the requirements of paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section if requested to do so by the 8(a) contractor 
when:
    (1) It is necessary for the owners of the concern to surrender 
partial control of such concern on a temporary basis in order to obtain 
equity financing;
    (2) Ownership and control of the concern that is performing the 8(a) 
contract will pass to another Participant, but only if the acquiring 
firm would otherwise be eligible to receive the award directly as an 
8(a) contract;
    (3) Any individual upon whom eligibility was based is no longer able 
to exercise control of the concern due to physical or mental incapacity 
or death;
    (4) The head of the procuring agency, or an official with delegated 
authority from the agency head, certifies that termination of the 
contract would severely impair attainment of the agency's program 
objectives or missions; or
    (5) It is necessary for the disadvantaged owners of the initial 8(a) 
awardee to relinquish ownership of a majority of the voting stock of the 
concern in order to raise equity capital, but only if--
    (i) The concern has graduated from the 8(a) BD program;
    (ii) The disadvantaged owners will maintain ownership of the largest 
single outstanding block of voting stock (including stock held by 
affiliated parties); and
    (iii) The disadvantaged owners will maintain control of the daily 
business operations of the concern.
    (c) The 8(a) contractor must request a waiver in writing prior to 
the change of ownership and control except in the case of death or 
incapacity. A request for waiver due to incapacity or death must be 
submitted within 60 days after such occurrence. The Participant seeking 
to change ownership or control must specify the grounds upon which it 
requests a waiver, and must demonstrate that the proposed transaction 
would meet such grounds.
    (d) SBA determines the eligibility of an acquiring Participant under 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section by referring to the items identified in 
Sec. 124.507(b)(2) and deciding whether at the time of the request for 
waiver (and prior to the transaction) the acquiring Participant is a 
responsible and eligible concern with respect to each contract for which 
a waiver is sought. As part of the waiver request, the acquiring firm 
must certify that it is a small business for the size standard 
corresponding to the SIC code assigned to each contract for which a 
waiver is sought.
    (e) Anyone other than a procuring agency head who submits a 
certification regarding the impairment of the agency's objectives under 
paragraph (b)(4) of this section, must also certify delegated authority 
to make the certification.
    (f) In processing a request for a waiver under paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section, SBA will treat a transfer of all a Participant's operating 
assets to another Participant the same as the transfer of an ownership 
interest, provided the Participant that transfers its assets to another 
eligible Participant:
    (1) Voluntarily graduates from the 8(a) BD program; and

[[Page 278]]

    (2) Ceases its business operations, or presents a plan to SBA for 
its orderly dissolution.
    (g) A concern performing an 8(a) contract must notify SBA in writing 
immediately upon entering into an agreement or agreement in principle 
(either oral or written) to transfer all or part of its stock or other 
ownership interest or assets to any other party. Such an agreement could 
include an oral agreement to enter into a transaction to transfer 
interests in the future.
    (h) The Administrator has discretion to decline a request for waiver 
even though legal authority exists to grant the waiver.
    (i) The 8(a) contractor may appeal SBA's denial of a waiver request 
by filing a petition with OHA pursuant to part 134 of this title within 
45 days of the date of service (as defined in Sec. 134.204) of the 
Administrator's decision.


<R05>
Sec. 124.516  Who decides contract disputes arising between a Participant and a procuring activity after the award of an 8(a) contract?

    For purposes of the Disputes Clause of a specific 8(a) contract, the 
contracting officer is that of the procuring activity. A dispute arising 
between an 8(a) contractor and the procuring activity contracting 
officer will be decided by the procuring activity, and appeals may be 
taken by the 8(a) contractor without SBA involvement.


<R05>
Sec. 124.517  Can the eligibility or size of a Participant for award of an 8(a) contract be questioned?

    (a) The eligibility of a Participant for a sole source or 
competitive 8(a) requirement may not be challenged by another 
Participant or any other party, either to SBA or any administrative 
forum as part of a bid or other contract protest.
    (b) The size status of the apparent successful offeror for a 
competitive 8(a) procurement may be protested pursuant to 
Sec. 121.1001(a)(2) of this chapter. The size status of a nominated 
Participant for a sole source 8(a) procurement may not be protested by 
another Participant or any other party.
    (c) A Participant cannot appeal SBA's determination not to award it 
a specific 8(a) contract because the concern lacks an element of 
responsibility or is ineligible for the contract, other than the right 
set forth in Sec. 124.501(h) to request a formal size determination 
where SBA cannot verify it to be small.
    (d)(1) The SIC code assigned to a sole source 8(a) requirement may 
not be challenged by another Participant or any other party either to 
SBA or any administrative forum as part of a bid or contract protest. 
Only the AA/8(a)BD may appeal a SIC code designation with respect to a 
sole source 8(a) requirement.
    (2) In connection with a competitive 8(a) procurement, any 
interested party who has been adversely affected by a SIC code 
designation may appeal the designation to SBA's OHA pursuant to 
Sec. 121.1103 of this title.
    (e) Anyone with information questioning the eligibility of a 
Participant to continue participation in the 8(a) BD program or for 
purposes of a specific 8(a) contract may submit such information to SBA 
under Sec. 124.112(c).


<R05>
Sec. 124.518  How can an 8(a) contract be terminated before performance is completed?

    (a) Termination for default. A decision to terminate a specific 8(a) 
contract for default can be made by the procuring activity contracting 
officer after consulting with SBA. The contracting officer must advise 
SBA of any intent to terminate an 8(a) contract for default in writing 
before doing so. SBA may provide to the Participant any program benefits 
reasonably available in order to assist it in avoiding termination for 
default. SBA will advise the contracting officer of this effort. Any 
procuring activity contracting officer who believes grounds for 
termination continue to exist may terminate the 8(a) contract for 
default, in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (48 CFR 
chapter 1). SBA will have no liability for termination costs or 
reprocurement costs.
    (b) Termination for convenience. After consulting with SBA, the 
procuring activity contracting officer may terminate an 8(a) contract 
for convenience when it is in the best interests of the Government to do 
so. A termination for convenience is appropriate if any disadvantaged 
owner of the Participant

[[Page 279]]

performing the contract relinquishes ownership or control of such 
concern, or enters into any agreement to relinquish such ownership or 
control, unless a waiver is granted pursuant to Sec. 124.515.
    (c) Substitution of one 8(a) contractor for another. Where a 
procuring activity contracting officer demonstrates to SBA that an 8(a) 
contract will otherwise be terminated for default, SBA may authorize 
another Participant to complete performance and, in conjunction with the 
procuring activity, permit novation of the contract without invoking the 
termination for convenience or waiver provisions of Sec. 124.515.


<R05>
Sec. 124.519  Are there any dollar limits on the amount of 8(a) contracts that a Participant may receive?

    (a) A Participant (other than one owned by an Indian tribe or an 
ANC) may not receive sole source 8(a) contract awards where it has 
received a combined total of competitive and sole source 8(a) contracts 
in excess of the dollar amount set forth in this section during its 
participation in the 8(a) BD program.
    (1) For a firm having a revenue-based primary SIC code at time of 
program entry, the limit above which it can no longer receive sole 
source 8(a) contracts is five times the size standard corresponding to 
that SIC code as of the date of SBA's acceptance of the requirement for 
the 8(a) BD program or $100,000,000, whichever is less.
    (2) For a firm having an employee-based primary SIC code at time of 
program entry, the limit above which it can no longer receive sole 
source 8(a) contracts is $100,000,000.
    (3) SBA will not consider 8(a) contracts awarded under $100,000 in 
determining whether a Participant has reached the limit identified in 
paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section.
    (b) Once the limit is reached, a firm may not receive any more 8(a) 
sole source contracts, but may remain eligible for competitive 8(a) 
awards.
    (c) The limitation set forth in paragraph (a) of this section will 
not apply for firms that are current Participants in the 8(a) BD program 
as of December 31, 1997.
    (d) SBA includes the dollar value of 8(a) options and modifications 
in determining whether a Participant has reached the limit identified in 
paragraph (a) of this section. If an option is not exercised or the 
contract value is reduced by modification, SBA will deduct those values.
    (e) A Participant's eligibility for a sole source award in terms of 
whether it has exceeded the dollar limit for 8(a) contracts is measured 
as of the date that the requirement is accepted for the 8(a) program 
without taking into account whether the value of that award will cause 
the limit to be exceeded.
    (f) The SBA Administrator on a non-delegable basis may waive the 
requirement prohibiting a Participant from receiving sole source 8(a) 
contracts in excess of the dollar amount set forth in this section where 
the head of a procuring activity represents to the SBA Administrator 
that award of a sole source 8(a) contract to the Participant is needed 
to achieve significant interests of the Government.


<R05>
Sec. 124.520  Mentor/protege program.

    (a) General. The mentor/protege program is designed to encourage 
approved mentors to provide various forms of assistance to eligible 
Participants. This assistance may include technical and/or management 
assistance; financial assistance in the form of equity investments and/
or loans; subcontracts; and/or assistance in performing prime contracts 
with the Government in the form of joint venture arrangements. The 
purpose of the mentor/protege relationship is to enhance the 
capabilities of the protege and to improve its ability to successfully 
compete for contracts.
    (b) Mentors. Any concern that demonstrates a commitment and the 
ability to assist developing 8(a) Participants may act as a mentor and 
receive benefits as set forth in this section. This includes businesses 
that have graduated from the 8(a) BD program, firms that are in the 
transitional stage of program participation, other small businesses, and 
large businesses.
    (1) In order to qualify as a mentor, a concern must demonstrate that 
it:

[[Page 280]]

    (i) Possesses favorable financial health, including profitability 
for at least the last two years;
    (ii) Possesses good character;
    (iii) Does not appear on the federal list of debarred or suspended 
contractors; and
    (iv) Can impart value to a protege firm due to lessons learned and 
practical experience gained because of the 8(a) BD program, or through 
its general knowledge of government contracting.
    (2) Generally, a mentor will have no more than one protege at a 
time. However, the AA/8(a)BD may authorize a concern to mentor more than 
one protege at a time where the concern can demonstrate that the 
additional mentor/protege relationship will not adversely affect the 
development of either protege firm (e.g., the second firm cannot be a 
competitor of the first firm).
    (3) In order to demonstrate its favorable financial health, a firm 
seeking to be a mentor must submit its federal tax returns for the last 
two years to SBA for review.
    (4) Once approved, a mentor must annually certify that it continues 
to possess good character and a favorable financial position.
    (c) Proteges. (1) In order to initially qualify as a protege firm, a 
Participant must:
    (i) Be in the developmental stage of program participation;
    (ii) Have never received an 8(a) contract; or
    (ii) Have a size that is less than half the size standard 
corresponding to its primary SIC code.
    (2) Only firms that are in good standing in the 8(a) BD program 
(e.g., firms that do not have termination or suspension proceedings 
against them, and are up to date with all reporting requirements) may 
qualify as a protege.
    (3) A protege firm may have only one mentor at a time.
    (d) Benefits. (1) A mentor and protege may joint venture as a small 
business for any government procurement, including procurements less 
than half the size standard corresponding to the assigned SIC code and 
8(a) sole source contracts, provided both the mentor and the protege 
qualify as small for the procurement and, for purposes of 8(a) sole 
source requirements, the protege has not reached the dollar limit set 
forth in Sec. 124.519.
    (2) Notwithstanding the requirements set forth in Secs. 124.105(g) 
and (h), in order to raise capital for the protege firm, the mentor may 
own an equity interest of up to 40% in the protege firm.
    (3) Notwithstanding the mentor/protege relationship, a protege firm 
may qualify for other assistance as a small business, including SBA 
financial assistance.
    (4) No determination of affiliation or control may be found between 
a protege firm and its mentor based on the mentor/protege agreement or 
any assistance provided pursuant to the agreement.
    (e) Written agreement. (1) The mentor and protege firms must enter a 
written agreement setting forth an assessment of the protege's needs and 
describing the assistance the mentor commits to provide to address those 
needs (e.g., management and/or technical assistance, loans and/or equity 
investments, cooperation on joint venture projects, or subcontracts 
under prime contracts being performed by the mentor). The agreement must 
also provide that the mentor will provide such assistance to the protege 
firm for at least one year.
    (2) The written agreement must be approved by the AA/8(a)BD. The 
agreement will not be approved if SBA determines that the assistance to 
be provided is not sufficient to promote any real developmental gains to 
the protege, or if SBA determines that the agreement is merely a vehicle 
to enable a non-8(a) participant to receive 8(a) contracts.
    (3) The agreement must provide that either the protege or the mentor 
may terminate the agreement with 30 days advance notice to the other 
party to the mentor/protege relationship and to SBA.
    (4) SBA will review the mentor/protege relationship annually to 
determine whether to approve its continuation for another year.
    (5) SBA must approve all changes to a mentor/protege agreement in 
advance.
    (f) Evaluating the mentor/protege relationship. (1) In its annual 
business plan

[[Page 281]]

update required by Sec. 124.403(a,) the protege must report to SBA for 
the protege's preceding program year:
    (i) All technical and/or management assistance provided by the 
mentor to the protege;
    (ii) All loans to and/or equity investments made by the mentor in 
the protege;
    (iii) All subcontracts awarded to the protege by the mentor, and the 
value of each subcontract;
    (iv) All federal contracts awarded to the mentor/protege 
relationship as a joint venture (designating each as an 8(a), small 
business set aside, or unrestricted procurement), the value of each 
contract, and the percentage of the contract performed and the 
percentage of revenue accruing to each party to the joint venture; and
    (v) A narrative describing the success such assistance has had in 
addressing the developmental needs of the protege and addressing any 
problems encountered.
    (2) The protege must annually certify to SBA whether there has been 
any change in the terms of the agreement.
    (3) SBA will review the protege's report on the mentor/protege 
relationship as part of its annual review of the firm's business plan 
pursuant to Sec. 124.403. SBA may decide not to approve continuation of 
the agreement if it finds that the mentor has not provided the 
assistance set forth in the mentor/protege agreement or that the 
assistance has not resulted in any material benefits or developmental 
gains to the protege.

                  Miscellaneous Reporting Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 124.601  What reports does SBA require concerning parties who assist Participants in obtaining federal contracts?

    (a) Each Participant must submit annually a written report to its 
assigned BOS that includes a listing of any agents, representatives, 
attorneys, accountants, consultants and other parties (other than 
employees) receiving fees, commissions, or compensation of any kind to 
assist such participant in obtaining a Federal contract. The listing 
must indicate the amount of compensation paid and a description of the 
activities performed for such compensation.
    (b) Failure to submit the report is good cause for the initiation of 
a termination proceeding pursuant to Secs. 124.303 and 124.304.


<R05>
Sec. 124.602  What kind of annual financial statement must a Participant submit to SBA?

    (a) Participants with gross annual receipts of more than $5,000,000 
must submit to SBA audited annual financial statements prepared by a 
licensed independent public accountant within 120 days after the close 
of the concern's fiscal year.
    (1) The servicing SBA District Director may waive the requirement 
for audited financial statements for good cause shown by the 
Participant.
    (2) Circumstances where waivers of audited financial statements may 
be granted include, but are not limited to, the following:
    (i) The concern has an unexpected increase in sales towards the end 
of its fiscal year that creates an unforeseen requirement for audited 
statements;
    (ii) The concern unexpectedly experiences severe financial 
difficulties which would make the cost of audited financial statements a 
particular burden; and
    (iii) The concern has been a Participant less than 12 months.
    (b) Participants with gross annual receipts between $1,000,000 and 
$5,000,000 must submit to SBA reviewed annual financial statements 
prepared by a licensed independent public accountant within 90 days 
after the close of the concern's fiscal year.
    (c) Participants with gross annual receipts of less than $1,000,000 
must submit to SBA an annual statement prepared in-house or a 
compilation statement prepared by a licensed independent public 
accountant, verified as to accuracy by an authorized officer, partner, 
limited liability member, or sole proprietor of the Participant, 
including signature and date, within 90 days after the close of the 
concern's fiscal year.
    (d) Any audited or reviewed financial statements submitted to SBA 
pursuant to paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section must be prepared in 
accordance with

[[Page 282]]

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
    (e) While financial statements need not be submitted until 90 or 120 
days after the close of a Participant's fiscal year, depending on the 
receipts of the concern, a Participant seeking to be awarded an 8(a) 
contract between the close of its fiscal year and such 90 or 120-day 
time period must submit a final sales report signed by the CEO or 
President to SBA in order for SBA to determine the concern's eligibility 
for the 8(a) contract. This report must show a breakdown of 8(a) and 
non-8(a) sales.
    (f) Notwithstanding the amount of a Participant's gross annual 
receipts, SBA may require audited or reviewed statements whenever they 
are needed to obtain more complete information as to a concern's assets, 
liabilities, income or expenses, such as when the concern's capacity to 
perform a specific 8(a) contract must be determined, or when they are 
needed to determine continued program eligibility.


<R05>
Sec. 124.603  What reports regarding the continued business operations of former Participants does SBA require?

    Former Participants must provide such information as SBA may request 
concerning the former Participant's continued business operations, 
contracts, and financial condition for a period of three years following 
the date on which the concern graduates or is terminated from the 
program. Failure to provide such information when requested will 
constitute a violation of the regulations set forth in this part, and 
may result in the nonexercise of options on or termination of contracts 
awarded through the 8(a) BD program, debarment, or other legal recourse.

               Management and Technical Assistance Program


<R05>
Sec. 124.701  What is the purpose of the 7(j) management and technical assistance program?

    Section 7(j)(1) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 636(j)(1),

contracts with public or private organizations to pay all or part of the 
cost of technical or management assistance for individuals or concerns 
eligible for assistance under sections 7(a)(11), 7(j)(10), or 8(a) of 
the Small Business Act.


<R05>
Sec. 124.702  What types of assistance are available through the 7(j) program?

concerns; and
    (b) The identification and development of new business 
opportunities.


<R05>
Sec. 124.703  Who is eligible to receive 7(j) assistance?

    The following businesses are eligible to receive assistance from SBA 
through its service providers:

unemployed or low-income individuals, or which are owned by such low-
income individuals; and
    (b) Businesses eligible to receive 8(a) contracts.


<R05>
Sec. 124.704  What additional management and technical assistance is reserved exclusively for concerns eligible to receive 8(a) contracts?

authorizes SBA to provide additional management and technical assistance 
through its service providers exclusively to small business concerns 
eligible to receive 8(a) contracts, including:
    (a) Assistance to develop comprehensive business plans with specific 
business targets, objectives, and goals;
    (b) Other nonfinancial services necessary for a Participant's growth 
and development, including loan packaging; and
    (c) Assistance in obtaining equity and debt financing.

<R04>
Subpart B--Eligibility, Certification, and Protests Relating to Federal 
                  Small Disadvantaged Business Programs

    Source: 63 FR 35772, June 30, 1998, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 124.1001  General applicability.

    (a) This subpart defines a Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB). It 
also sets forth procedures by which a firm can apply to be recognized as 
an SDB, including procedures to be used by private sector entities 
approved by SBA for determining whether a particular concern is owned 
and controlled by one or more disadvantaged individuals or Alaska Native 
Corporations (ANCs), Community Development Corporations (CDCs), Indian 
tribes (tribes) or Native Hawaiian Organizations (NHOs). Finally, this 
subpart establishes procedures by which SBA determines whether a 
particular concern qualifies as an SDB in response to a protest 
challenging the concern's status as disadvantaged. Unless specifically 
stated otherwise, the phrase ``socially and economically disadvantaged 
individuals'' in this subpart includes tribes, ANCs, CDCs, and NHOs.
    (b) Only small firms that are owned and controlled by socially and 
economically disadvantaged individuals are eligible to participate in 
Federal SDB price evaluation adjustment, evaluation factor or subfactor, 
monetary subcontracting incentive, or set-aside programs, or SBA's 
section 8(d) subcontracting program.
    (c) In order for a concern to represent that it is an SDB as a prime 
contractor for purposes of a Federal Government procurement, it must 
have:
    (1) Received a certification from SBA that it qualifies as an SDB; 
or
    (2) Submitted an application for SDB certification to SBA or a 
Private Certifier, and must not have received a negative determination 
regarding that application from SBA or the Private Certifier.
    (d) A firm cannot represent itself to be an SDB concern in order to 
receive a preference as an SDB for any Federal subcontracting program if 
it is not on the SBA-maintained list of qualified SDBs.


<R05>
Sec. 124.1002  What is a Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB)?

    (a) Reliance on 8(a) criteria. In determining whether a firm 
qualifies as an SDB, the criteria of social and economic disadvantage 
and other eligibility requirements established in subpart A of this part 
apply, including the requirements of ownership and control and 
disadvantaged status, unless otherwise provided in this subpart. 
Qualified Private Certifiers must use the 8(a) criteria applicable to 
ownership and control in determining whether a particular firm is 
actually owned and controlled by one or more individuals claiming 
disadvantaged status.
    (b) SDB eligibility criteria. A small disadvantaged business (SDB) 
is a concern:
    (1) Which qualifies as small under part 121 of this title for the 
size standard corresponding to the applicable four digit Standard 
Industrial Classification (SIC) code.
    (i) For purposes of SDB certification, the applicable SIC code is 
that which relates to the primary business activity of the concern;
    (ii) For purposes related to a specific Federal Government contract, 
the applicable SIC code is that assigned by the contracting officer to 
the procurement at issue;
    (2) Which is at least 51 percent unconditionally owned by one or 
more socially and economically disadvantaged individuals as set forth in 
Sec. 124.105. For the requirements relating to tribes and ANCs, NHOs, or 
CDCs, see Secs. 124.109, 124.110, and 124.111, respectively.
    (3) Except for tribes, ANCs, NHOs, and CDCs, whose management and 
daily business operations are controlled by one or more socially and 
economically disadvantaged individuals. For the requirements relating to 
tribes and ANCs, NHOs, or CDCs, see Secs. 124.109, 124.110, and 124.111, 
respectively.
    (4) Which, for purposes of SDB procurement mechanisms authorized by 
10 U.S.C. 2323 (such as price evaluation adjustments, evaluation factors 
or subfactors, monetary subcontracting incentives, or SDB set-asides) 
relating to the Department of Defense, NASA and

[[Page 284]]

the Coast Guard only, has the majority of its earnings accruing directly 
to the socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.
    (c) Disadvantaged status. In assessing the personal financial 
condition of an individual claiming economic disadvantage, his or her 
net worth must be less than $750,000 after taking into account the 
exclusions set forth in Sec. 124.104(c)(2).
    (d) Additional eligibility criteria. Except for tribes, ANCs, CDCs 
and NHOs, each individual claiming disadvantaged status must be a 
citizen of the United States.
    (e) Potential for success not required. The potential for success 
requirement set forth in Sec. 124.107 does not apply as an eligibility 
requirement for an SDB.
    (f) Joint ventures. Joint ventures are permitted for SDB procurement 
mechanisms (such as price evaluation adjustments, evaluation factors or 
subfactors, monetary subcontracting incentives, or SDB set-asides), 
provided that the requirements set forth in this paragraph are met.
    (1) The disadvantaged participant(s) to the joint venture must have:
    (i) Received an SDB certification from SBA; or
    (ii) Submitted an application for SDB certification to SBA or a 
Private Certifier, and must not have received a negative determination 
regarding that application.
    (2) For purposes of this paragraph, the term joint venture means two 
or more concerns forming an association to engage in and carry out a 
single, specific business venture for joint profit. Two or more concerns 
that form an ongoing relationship to conduct business would not be 
considered ``joint venturers'' within the meaning of this paragraph, and 
would also not be eligible to be certified as an SDB. The entity created 
by such a relationship would not be owned and controlled by one or more 
socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. Each contract for 
which a joint venture submits an offer will be evaluated on a case by 
case basis.
    (3) Except as set forth in 13 CFR 121.103(f)(3), a concern that is 
owned and controlled by one or more socially and economically 
disadvantaged individuals entering into a joint venture agreement with 
one or more other business concerns is considered to be affiliated with 
such other concern(s) for size purposes. If the exception does not 
apply, the combined annual receipts or employees of the concerns 
entering into the joint venture must meet the applicable size standard 
corresponding to the SIC code designated for the contract.
    (4) An SDB must be the managing venturer of the joint venture, and 
an employee of the managing venturer must be the project manager 
responsible for performance of the contract.
    (5) The joint venture must perform any applicable percentage of work 
required of SDB offerors, and the SDB joint venturer(s) must perform a 
significant portion of the contract.
    (g) Ownership restrictions for non-disadvantaged individuals. The 
ownership restrictions set forth in Sec. 124.105 (g) and (h) for non-
disadvantaged individuals and concerns do not apply for purposes of 
determining SDB eligibility.


<R05>
Sec. 124.1003  What is a Private Certifier?

    A Private Certifier is an organization or business concern approved 
by SBA to determine whether firms are owned and controlled by one or 
more individuals claiming disadvantaged status. SBA may elect to arrange 
for one or more Private Certifiers to perform certain functions in the 
SDB Certification process. When that election is made, the provisions of 
Secs. 124.1004 through 124.1007 will apply. SBA will establish more 
detailed standards regarding qualifications, monitoring, procedures and 
use, if any, of Private Certifiers in specific contracts or agreements 
between SBA and the Private Certifiers.


<R05>
Sec. 124.1004  How does an organization or business concern become a Private Certifier?

    (a) SBA may execute contracts or agreements with organizations or 
business concerns seeking to become Private Certifiers. Any such 
contract or agreement will include provisions for the oversight, 
monitoring, and evaluation of all certification activities by SBA.
    (b) The organization or business concern must demonstrate a 
knowledge of

[[Page 285]]

SBA's regulations regarding ownership and control, as well as business 
organizations and the legal principles affecting their ownership and 
control generally, including stock issuances, voting rights, 
convertability of debt to equity, options, and powers and 
responsibilities of officers and directors, general and limited 
partners, and limited liability members.
    (c) The organization or concern must also, along with its 
principals, demonstrate good character. Good character does not exist 
for these purposes if the organization or concern or any of its 
principals:
    (1) Is debarred or suspended under any Federal procurement or non-
procurement debarment and suspension regulations; or
    (2) Has been indicted or convicted for any criminal offense or 
suffered a civil judgment indicating a lack of business integrity.
    (d) As a condition of approval, SBA may require that appropriate 
officers and/or key employees of the concern attend a training session 
on SBA's rules and requirements.
    (e) An organization or concern seeking to become a Private Certifier 
must agree to provide access to SBA of its books and records when 
requested, including records pertaining to its certification activities. 
Once SBA approves the organization or concern to be a Private Certifier, 
SBA may review this information, as well as the decisions of the Private 
Certifier, in determining whether it will renew or extend the term of 
the Private Certifier, or terminate the Private Certifier for cause.
    (f) SBA will include in any contract or agreement document 
authorizing an entity to act as a Private Certifier appropriate 
conditions to prohibit conflicts of interests between the Private 
Certifier and the firms for which it processes SDB applications and to 
protect the integrity of the decision-making process.


<R05>
Sec. 124.1005  Can a fee be charged to a firm to process the firm's application for SDB certification?

    (a) With SBA's approval, a Private Certifier may charge a reasonable 
fee to a firm in order to screen the firm's application for completeness 
and to process a determination of ownership and control. The fee must be 
for actual services rendered and must not be related to whether or not 
the business concern is found to be owned and controlled by one or more 
individuals or entities claiming disadvantaged status.
    (b) Where SBA makes the determination of ownership and control, SBA 
may collect a fee comparable to that which would be charged by a Private 
Certifier. From time to time, SBA will publish a Notice in the Federal 
Register identifying any fee that SBA will charge to process a firm's 
determination of ownership and control. SBA will promptly remit any 
funds received pursuant to this section to the Treasury of the United 
States as miscellaneous receipts.


<R05>
Sec. 124.1006  Is there a list of Private Certifiers?

    SBA will maintain a list of approved Private Certifiers on SBA's 
Home Page on the Internet. Any interested person may also obtain a copy 
of the list from the local SBA district office.


<R05>
Sec. 124.1007  How long may an organization or business concern be a Private Certifier?

    (a) SBA's approval document will specify how long the organization 
or concern may be a Private Certifier. The initial contract or agreement 
will have a base period of one year, and may include option years or 
renewal provisions.
    (b) SBA may terminate a contract or agreement with an organization 
or business concern which is a Private Certifier for the convenience of 
the Government at any time, and may terminate the contract or agreement 
for default where appropriate. Specific grounds for termination for 
default include, but are not limited to:
    (1) Charging improper, unreasonable or contingent fees in violation 
of Sec. 124.1005;
    (2) Engaging in prohibited business transactions with the firms for 
which it processes SDB applications in violation of Sec. 124.1004(f); or
    (3) A demonstrated record of ownership and control determinations 
that

[[Page 286]]

are overturned on appeal by SBA's Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) 
or by SBA as part of an SDB protest.


<R05>
Sec. 124.1008  How does a firm become certified as an SDB?

    Any firm may apply to be certified as an SDB. SBA's field offices 
will provide further information and required application forms to any 
firm interested in SDB certification. In order to become certified as an 
SDB, a firm must apply to SBA or, if directed by SBA, to a Private 
Certifier. The application must include evidence demonstrating that the 
firm is owned and controlled by one or more individuals claiming 
disadvantaged status, along with certifications or narratives regarding 
the disadvantaged status of such individuals. See paragraph (e)(1) of 
this section. The firm also must submit information necessary for a size 
determination. See Sec. 121.1008. Current 8(a) BD Participants do not 
need to submit applications for SDB status. These concerns automatically 
qualify as SDBs by virtue of their status as 8(a) BD concerns. An 8(a) 
Participant's continuing eligibility as an SDB will be reviewed as part 
of the concern's 8(a) annual review.
    (a) Filing an SDB application. (1) An interested firm must first 
submit a complete application to SBA's Assistant Administrator for Small 
Disadvantaged Business Certification and Eligibility (AA/SDBCE), Small 
Business Administration, 409 3rd Street, SW, Washington, DC 20416, or to 
a specific SBA field office or an approved Private Certifier if directed 
by SBA.
    (2) The firm must identify which individual(s) or entities are 
claiming disadvantaged status.
    (b) Required forms. Each firm seeking to be certified as an SDB must 
submit those forms and attachments required by SBA when applying for 
admission to the 8(a) BD program. These forms and attachments may 
include, but not be limited to, financial statements, Federal personal 
and business tax returns and personal history statements. The 
application package may be in the form of an electronic application.
    (c) Application processing. (1) SBA or a Private Certifier will 
advise each applicant generally within 15 days after the receipt of an 
application whether the application is complete and suitable for 
evaluation and, if not, what additional information or clarification is 
required. If the application is not complete, SBA or the Private 
Certifier will return the application to the firm, and will notify the 
firm that it may reapply when its application is complete.
    (2) The burden is on the applicant to demonstrate that those 
individuals claiming disadvantaged status own and control the concern.
    (d) Ownership and control decision. SBA or a Private Certifier will 
determine whether those individuals claiming disadvantaged status own 
and control the applicant firm within 30 days of receipt of a complete 
application package, whenever practicable..
    (1) Where a Private Certifier determines ownership and control, the 
Private Certifier will issue a written decision as to whether the 
applicant is owned and controlled by the individuals identified as 
claiming disadvantaged status.
    (i) If the Private Certifier finds that the applicant is owned and 
controlled by the individuals claiming disadvantaged status, the Private 
Certifier will forward the application to SBA along with a copy of its 
ownership and control determination and the information required by 
paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, where appropriate.
    (ii) If the Private Certifier finds that the applicant is not owned 
and controlled by the individuals claiming disadvantaged status, its 
decision must state the specific reasons for the finding, and inform the 
applicant of its right to appeal the decision to SBA pursuant to 
Sec. 124.1009.
    (2) Where SBA determines ownership and control, SBA will first 
determine whether the applicant is owned and controlled by the 
individual(s) claiming to be disadvantaged. If SBA determines that the 
applicant is not owned and controlled by the individual(s) claiming 
disadvantaged status, SBA will issue a written decision addressing only 
the ownership and control issues. If SBA determines that the applicant 
is owned and controlled by the individual(s) claiming disadvantaged 
status, SBA will issue a single written decision as to whether the 
applicant qualifies as

[[Page 287]]

an SDB. Such a determination will include the ownership and control of 
the firm, the size status of the firm, and the disadvantaged status of 
those individuals claiming to be disadvantaged.
    (3) In its sole discretion, SBA may analyze and determine whether a 
firm is owned and controlled by one or more individuals claiming 
disadvantaged status notwithstanding the availability of a Private 
Certifier to make such a decision.
    (4) SBA reserves the right to re-evaluate an approved decision on 
ownership and control by a Private Certifier in a case where it has 
credible evidence that the Private Certifier has substantially 
disregarded the eligibility criteria.
    (e) Disadvantaged determination. Once a concern receives a decision 
finding that it is owned and controlled by those individuals or entities 
claiming disadvantaged status (either through an initial determination 
or on appeal), SBA will determine whether the other eligibility criteria 
are met, and, if so, will include the SDB on the SBA-maintained list of 
qualified SDBs. SBA will make this determination within 30 days of 
receiving an SDB application, if practicable.
    (1) Members of designated groups. (i) Those individuals claiming 
disadvantaged status that are members of the same designated groups that 
are presumed to be socially disadvantaged for purposes of SBA's 8(a) BD 
program (see Sec. 124.103(b)) are presumed to be socially and 
economically disadvantaged for purposes of SDB certification. These 
individuals must represent that they are members of one of the 
designated groups, that they are identified as a member of one of the 
designated groups, that their net worth is less than $750,000 after 
taking into account the exclusions set forth in Sec. 124.104(c)(2), and 
that they are citizens of the United States.
    (ii) Absent credible evidence to the contrary, SBA may accept these 
representations as true and certify the firm as an SDB.
    (2) Individuals not members of designated groups. (i) Each 
individual claiming disadvantaged status who is not a member of one of 
the designated groups must submit a statement identifying personally how 
his or her entry into or advancement in the business world has been 
impaired because of personally specific factors (see Sec. 124.103(c)), 
and how his or her ability to compete in the free enterprise system has 
been impaired due to diminished capital and credit opportunities (see 
Secs. 124.103(c) and 124.104).
    (ii) Where a Private Certifier determines ownership and control, the 
Private Certifier must also review the disadvantaged status submission 
and any other required information, and send to SBA the following:
    (A) An executive summary and analysis of the disadvantaged status 
submission;
    (B) The application and all supporting documentation; and
    (C) A certification that the application is complete and suitable 
for evaluation.
    (3) Concerns owned by tribes, ANCs, CDCs, or NHOs: SBA will process 
SDB applications from concerns owned and controlled by tribes, ANCs, 
CDCs, or NHOs in the same way as those from concerns owned by 
individuals who are members of designated groups.
    (f) SDB Determination. (1) If SBA's AA/SDBCE determines that the 
individual(s) claiming disadvantage are disadvantaged and other 
eligibility criteria are met, he or she will certify the firm as an SDB.
    (2) If SBA's AA/SDBCE determines that one or more of the individuals 
claiming to be disadvantaged is not disadvantaged and their 
disadvantaged status is required to establish disadvantaged ownership 
and control of the applicant, or any of the other eligibility criteria 
are not met, he or she will reject the firm's application for SDB 
certification. The AA/SDBCE will issue a written decision setting forth 
SBA's reasons for decline.
    (3) Pursuant to part 134 of this title, a firm may appeal to OHA the 
AA/SDBCE's decision that one or more of the individuals claiming 
disadvantaged status is not disadvantaged, or, where SBA determines 
ownership and control, that those claiming disadvantaged status do not 
own and control the applicant. (See Sec. 124.1009 for appeals from 
decisions by Private Certifiers.)

[[Page 288]]

    (i) The firm must serve SBA's Associate General Counsel for General 
Law with a copy of the appeal.
    (ii) OHA will determine whether SBA's decision in either case was 
arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. OHA's review is limited to 
the facts that were before SBA at the time of its decision and any 
arguments submitted in or in response to the appeal. OHA will not 
consider any facts beyond those that were already presented to SBA 
unless the administrative judge determines that manifest injustice would 
occur if the appeal were limited to the record.
    (4) A firm may also request a formal size determination pursuant to 
part 121 of this title where SBA finds that the firm is not small.
    (g) Current 8(a) BD program participants. Any firm that is currently 
a Participant in SBA's 8(a) BD program need not seek an ownership and 
control determination or apply to SBA for a separate certification as an 
SDB. SBA will certify current 8(a) BD Participants as SDBs, and 
automatically include them on the list of qualified SDBs.
    (h) 8(a) BD graduates. SBA will automatically certify a firm that 
has graduated from the SBA's 8(a) BD program to be an SDB, provided SBA 
determined that the firm continued to be eligible for the 8(a) BD 
program as part of an annual review within the last three years. (See 
Sec. 124.1014(b)).
    (i) Certification by DOT recipient. If a firm applying for SDB 
certification has a current, valid certification as a disadvantaged 
business enterprise (DBE) from a Department of Transportation (DOT) 
recipient, SBA may adopt the DBE certification as an SDB certification 
when determined by the AA/SDBCE or designee to be appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 124.1009  How does a firm appeal a decision of a Private Certifier?

    Where a Private Certifier performs an ownership and control 
determination and finds that a firm is not owned and controlled by the 
individual(s) claiming disadvantaged status, the firm may appeal that 
decision to OHA pursuant to part 134 of this title. The firm must serve 
SBA's Associate General Counsel for General Law and the applicable 
Private Certifier with a copy of the appeal.
    (a) The Private Certifier must submit to OHA the full record upon 
which its decision was based within two days of receiving notification 
that an appeal has been filed.
    (b) The Private Certifier and SBA may each elect to appear or not 
appear in an appeal proceeding.
    (c) OHA's review is limited to the facts that were before the 
Private Certifier at the time of its final decision and any arguments 
submitted in or in response to the appeal. OHA will not consider any 
facts beyond those that were already presented to the Private Certifier 
unless the administrative judge determines that manifest injustice would 
occur if the appeal were limited to the record.
    (d) OHA will decide whether it believes that the facts are supported 
by a preponderance of the evidence the Private Certifier's determination 
regarding ownership and control.
    (e) Where the facts presented in the record leave significant doubt 
as to whether the petitioner is or is not owned and controlled by one or 
more individuals claiming to be disadvantaged, the administrative judge 
may remand the case to the Private Certifier for reconsideration in 
accord with his or her remand order.
    (f) If OHA finds that the firm is owned and controlled by the 
individual(s) claiming disadvantaged status, OHA will refer the 
application to SBA for further processing. If OHA finds that the firm is 
not owned and controlled by such individual(s), the administrative judge 
will state the reasons for that decision, which will be the final 
decision of the Agency.


<R05>
Sec. 124.1010  Can a firm represent itself to be an SDB if it has not yet been certified as an SDB?

    (a) General rule. Except as set forth in paragraph (d) of this 
section, a firm may represent itself to be an SDB concern in order to 
receive a preference as an SDB for any Federal procurement program if it 
has submitted a complete application for SDB certification to SBA or a 
Private Certifier and it has not received a negative determination 
regarding that application from SBA or

[[Page 289]]

the Private Certifier. A firm that has received a negative determination 
of ownership and control or a negative determination regarding its 
disadvantaged status and is awaiting the resolution of its appeal of 
that determination may not represent itself to be an SDB.
    (b) Where applicant becomes successful offeror. If a concern becomes 
the apparent successful offeror on a contract for which it would receive 
a benefit for being an SDB while its application for SDB certification 
is pending, either at SBA or a Private Certifier, the contracting 
officer for the particular contract must immediately inform SBA's AA/
SDBCE. SBA will then prioritize the firm's SDB application and make a 
determination regarding the firm's status as an SDB within 15 days from 
the date that SBA received the contracting officer's notification.
    (1) Where the apparent successful offeror's completed application is 
pending an ownership and control determination with a Private Certifier, 
the concern must inform SBA which Private Certifier has its application. 
SBA will immediately contact the Private Certifier to require the 
Private Certifier to complete its ownership and control determination 
within 5 days of SBA's notification. In appropriate circumstances, SBA 
may undertake to make the determination itself, and may recoup the cost 
of the determination from the Private Certifier.
    (2) If requested to do so by the procuring activity contracting 
officer, SBA will determine whether other offerors are SDBs where they 
have represented that their completed applications for SDB status are 
pending at SBA or a Private Certifier and they could receive the award 
if SBA determines that the apparently successful offeror is not an SDB.
    (3) If the contracting officer does not receive an SBA determination 
within 15 calendar days after the SBA's receipt of the notification, the 
contracting officer will presume that the apparently successful offeror, 
and any other offerors referred to SBA in connection with the same 
procurement by the contracting officer, are not disadvantaged, and will 
make award accordingly, unless the contracting officer grants an 
extension to the 15-day response period.
    (c) Representation as SDB for statistical purposes. A firm may 
represent itself as an SDB concern for general statistical purposes 
without regard to any application for SDB certification or its inclusion 
on the SBA-maintained list of qualified SDB's.
    (d) Subcontracting programs. Only firms that are on the SBA-
maintained list of qualified SDBs may represent themselves as SDB 
concerns in order to receive a preference as an SDB for any Federal 
subcontracting program.


<R05>
Sec. 124.1011  What is a misrepresentation of SDB status?

    (a) Any person or entity that misrepresents a firm's status as a 
``small business concern owned and controlled by socially and 
economically disadvantaged individuals'' (``SDB status'') in order to 
obtain an 8(d) or SDB contracting opportunity or preference will be 
subject to the penalties imposed by section 16(d) of the Small Business 
Act, 15 U.S.C. 645(d), as well as any other penalty authorized by law.
    (b) A representation of SDB status by any firm that SBA has found 
not to be an SDB (either in connection with an SDB application or 
protest) will be deemed a misrepresentation of SDB status, unless and 
until the firm reapplies for and obtains SDB certification.


<R05>
Sec. 124.1012  Can a firm reapply for SDB certification?

    (a) A concern which has been denied SDB certification may reapply 
for certification at any time 12 months or more after the date of the 
most recent final decision of SBA to decline its application (either on 
appeal of an ownership and control determination, or a negative finding 
of disadvantaged status).
    (b) A concern which received a decision that it was not owned and 
controlled by the individual(s) claiming disadvantaged status from a 
Private Certifier and does not appeal that decision to OHA may apply for 
a new ownership and control determination at any time.

[[Page 290]]


<R05>
Sec. 124.1013  Is there a list of certified SDBs?

    (a) If SBA certifies a firm to be an SDB, SBA will enter the name of 
the firm into an SBA-maintained central on-line register, such as PRO-
Net.
    (b) The register of SDBs will contain the names of all firms that 
are currently certified to be SDBs, including the names of all firms 
currently participating in SBA's 8(a) BD program.
    (c) On a continuing basis, SBA will delete from the on-line register 
those firms that have:
    (1) Graduated or been terminated from SBA's 8(a) BD program for any 
reason and have not otherwise received SDB certification (see, 
Secs. 124.1008(h) and 124.1014(b) for treatment of 8(a) graduates);
    (2) Been determined not to be an SDB in response to an SDB protest 
brought under Sec. 124.1017; or
    (3) Other than current 8(a) Participants, not received a renewed SDB 
certification after being on the register for three years (see 
Sec. 124.1014(c)).


<R05>
Sec. 124.1014  How long does an SDB certification last?

    (a) Once SBA certifies a firm to be an SDB by placing it on the list 
of qualified SDBs, the firm will generally remain on the SBA-maintained 
list of certified SDBs for a period of three years from the date of its 
certification.
    (1) A firm's SDB certification will extend beyond three years where 
SBA finds the firm to be an SDB:
    (i) On the merits in connection with a particular protest (see 
Sec. 124.1023(h)(2));
    (ii) In connection with an SBA-initiated SDB determination (see 
Sec. 124.1016(a)(2)); or
    (iii) As part of an 8(a) BD annual review.
    (2) Where SBA finds a firm not to be an SDB in connection with an 
SDB protest, an SBA-initiated SDB determination, or an 8(a) BD annual 
review, SBA will immediately decertify the firm as an SDB and remove it 
from the qualified list of SDBs.
    (b) A firm that graduates from the 8(a) BD program will remain on 
the list of certified SDBs for a period of three years from the date of 
its last annual review.
    (c) To remain on the SDB register after three years, a firm whose 
status as an SDB has not been upheld in connection with a protest or an 
SBA-initiated SDB determination, or has not been certified as an 
eligible 8(a) Participant as part of an annual review, must submit a new 
application and receive a new certification.


<R05>
Sec. 124.1015  What is the effect of receiving an SDB certification?

    (a) A firm that is certified to be an SDB may represent itself as an 
SDB for such purposes as Federal price evaluation adjustments, 
evaluation factors or subfactors, monetary subcontracting incentive 
programs, section 8(d) subcontracts, SDB set-asides, or any other 
programs which accept an SBA certification. A contracting officer may 
award a contract based on a firm's representation that it is a certified 
SDB absent a protest that the protested concern's circumstances have 
materially changed since SBA certified it as an SDB, or that the 
protested concern's SDB application contained false or misleading 
information (see Sec. 124.1018(d)).
    (b) For purposes of a particular Federal procurement, the firm must 
represent that it is both disadvantaged and small at the time it submits 
its initial offer including price (see part 121 of this title). At the 
same time, the firm must also represent that no material change has 
occurred in its SDB status since its SDB certification, or from the date 
of its application for SDB certification if its application has not yet 
been processed, and must specifically represent that the net worth of 
the disadvantaged individuals (not including concerns owned by tribes, 
ANCs, CDCs, or NHOs) upon whom the SDB certification was based still 
does not exceed $750,000.
    (c) A firm's status as ``disadvantaged'' or ``small'' may be 
protested pursuant to Secs. 124.1017 through 124.1021 and Secs. 121.1001 
through 121.1005, respectively, despite the presence of the firm on the 
SDB register, provided the protest contains specific allegations that 
the firm's circumstances have materially changed since SBA certified it 
as

[[Page 291]]

an SDB, or that the firm's SDB application contained false or misleading 
information.


<R05>
Sec. 124.1016  Can SBA re-evaluate the SDB status of a firm after SBA certifies it to be SDB?

    (a) SBA may initiate an SDB determination whenever it receives 
credible information calling into the question a firm's eligibility as 
an SDB, including an adverse determination from a DOT recipient of the 
firm's status as a DBE. Upon its completion of an SDB determination, SBA 
will issue a written decision regarding the SDB status of the questioned 
firm.
    (1) If SBA finds that the firm does not qualify as an SDB, SBA will 
decertify the firm as an SDB, and immediately remove the firm from the 
list of qualified SDBs. The firm may appeal SBA's decision to OHA 
consistent with the provisions of Sec. 124.1008(f) and part 134 of this 
chapter.
    (2) If SBA finds that the firm continues to qualify as an SDB, the 
determination remains in effect for three years from the date of the 
decision under the same conditions as if the concern had been granted 
SDB certification under Sec. 124.1008.
    (b) An SDB firm must report within 10 days to the AA/SDBCE any 
changes in ownership and control or any other circumstances which could 
adversely affect its eligibility as an SDB.


<R05>
Sec. 124.1017  Who may protest the disadvantaged status of a concern?

    (a) In connection with a requirement for which the apparent 
successful offeror has invoked an SDB evaluation adjustment or an SDB 
set-aside, the following entities may protest the disadvantaged status 
of the apparent successful offeror:
    (1) Any other concern which submitted an offer for that requirement, 
unless the contracting officer has found the concern to be non-
responsive or outside the competitive range, or SBA has previously found 
the protesting concern to be ineligible for the requirement at issue;
    (2) The procuring activity contracting officer; or
    (3) SBA.
    (b) In connection with an 8(d) subcontract, or a requirement for 
which the apparent successful offeror received an evaluation adjustment 
for proposing one or more SDB subcontractors, the procuring activity 
contracting officer or SBA may protest the disadvantaged status of a 
proposed subcontractor. Other interested parties may submit information 
to the contracting officer or SBA in an effort to persuade the 
contracting officer or SBA to initiate a protest.
    (c) An interested party seeking to protest both the disadvantaged 
status and size of an apparent successful SDB offeror must submit two 
separate protests, one as to disadvantaged status pursuant to this 
subpart, and one as to size pursuant to part 121 of this title. An 
interested party seeking to protest only size of an apparent successful 
SDB offeror must submit a size protest to the contracting officer 
pursuant to part 121.


<R05>
Sec. 124.1018  When will SBA not decide an SDB protest?

    (a) SBA will not decide a protest as to disadvantaged status of any 
concern other than the apparent successful offeror.
    (b) SBA will not normally consider a post award protest. SBA may 
consider a post award protest in its discretion where it determines that 
a protest decision after award would have a practical effect (e.g., 
where the contracting officer agrees to terminate the contract if the 
protest is sustained).
    (c) SBA will not decide an untimely protest (see Sec. 124.1020(c)).
    (d) SBA will not decide a non-specific protest or one that does not 
present credible evidence that the protested concern's circumstances 
have materially changed since SBA certified it as an SDB, or that the 
protested concern's SDB application contained false or misleading 
information (see Sec. 124.1021).
    (e) An interested party may appeal SBA's dismissal of a protest for 
lack of specificity, timeliness, or a basis upon which SBA will consider 
a protest to SBA's Deputy Associate Deputy Administrator for Government 
Contracting and Minority Enterprise Development (DADA/GC&MED) pursuant 
to Sec. 124.1024.

[[Page 292]]


<R05>
Sec. 124.1019  Who decides disadvantaged status protests?

    In response to a protest challenging the disadvantaged status of a 
concern, the SBA's AA/SDBCE will determine whether the concern is 
disadvantaged.


<R05>
Sec. 124.1020  What procedures apply to disadvantaged status protests?

    (a) General. The protest procedures described in this section are 
separate and distinct from those governing size protests and appeals. 
All protests relating to whether a concern is a ``small'' business for 
purposes of any Federal program, including SDB set-asides and SDB 
evaluation adjustments, must be filed and processed pursuant to part 121 
of this title.
    (b) Filing. (1) All protests challenging the disadvantaged status of 
a concern with respect to a particular Federal procurement requirement 
must be submitted in writing to the procuring activity contracting 
officer, except in cases where the contracting officer or SBA initiates 
a protest.
    (2) Any contracting officer who initiates a protest must submit the 
protest in writing to SBA in accord with paragraph (c) of this section.
    (3) In cases where SBA initiates a protest, the protest must be 
submitted in writing to the AA/SDBCE and notification provided in accord 
with Sec. 124.1022(a).
    (c) Timeliness of protest. (1) SDB evaluation adjustment and set-
aside protests. (i) General. In order for a protest to be timely, it 
must be received by the contracting officer prior to the close of 
business on the fifth day, exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays and legal 
holidays, after the bid opening date for sealed bids, or after the 
receipt from the contracting officer of notification of the identity of 
the prospective awardee in negotiated acquisitions.
    (ii) Oral protests. An oral protest relating to an SDB set-aside or 
SDB evaluation adjustment made to the contracting officer within the 
allotted 5-day period will be considered a timely protest only if the 
contracting officer receives a confirming letter postmarked, FAXed, or 
delivered no later than one calendar day after the date of such oral 
protest.
    (iii) Protests of contracting officers or SBA. The time limitations 
in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section do not apply to contracting 
officers or SBA, and they may file protests before or after awards, 
except to the extent set forth in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
    (iv) Untimely protests. A protest received after the time limits set 
forth in this paragraph (c)(1) will be dismissed by SBA.
    (2) Section 8(d) protests. In connection with an 8(d) subcontract, 
the contracting officer or SBA must submit a protest to the AA/SDBCE 
prior to the completion of performance by the intended 8(d) 
subcontractor.
    (3) Premature protests. A protest in connection with any procurement 
which is submitted by any person, including the contracting officer, 
before bid opening or notification of intended award, whichever applies, 
will be considered premature, and will be returned to the protestor 
without action. A contracting officer that receives a premature protest 
must return it to the protestor without submitting it to the SBA.
    (d) Referral to SBA. (1) Any contracting officer who receives a 
protest that is not premature must promptly forward it to the SBA's AA/
SDBCE, 409 3rd Street, SW, Washington, DC 20416.
    (2) A contracting officer's referral of a protest to SBA must 
contain the following:
    (i) The written protest and any accompanying materials;
    (ii) The date on which the protest was received by the contracting 
officer;
    (iii) A copy of the protested concern's selfrepresentation as an 
SDB, and the date of such self-representation; and
    (iv) The date of bid opening or the date on which notification of 
the apparent successful offeror was sent to all unsuccessful offerors, 
as applicable.


<R05>
Sec. 124.1021  What format, degree of specificity, and basis does SBA require to consider an SDB protest?

    (a) Format. An SDB protest need not be in any specific format in 
order for SBA to consider it.
    (b) Specificity. A protest must be sufficiently specific to provide 
reasonable notice as to all grounds upon which the

[[Page 293]]

protested concern's disadvantaged status is challenged.
    (1) SBA will dismiss a protest that merely asserts that the 
protested concern is not disadvantaged, without setting forth specific 
facts or allegations.
    (2) The contracting officer must forward to SBA any non-premature 
protest received, notwithstanding whether he or she believes it is 
sufficiently specific or timely.
    (c) Basis. SBA will consider a protest challenging whether the 
apparent successful offeror is owned and controlled by one or more 
socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, including whether 
one or more of the individuals claiming disadvantaged status is in fact 
socially or economically disadvantaged, only if the protest presents 
credible evidence that the firm's circumstances have materially changed 
since SBA certified it as an SDB, or that the firm's SDB application 
contained false or misleading information.


<R05>
Sec. 124.1022  What will SBA do when it receives an SDB protest?

    (a) Upon receipt of a protest challenging the disadvantaged status 
of a concern, the AA/SDBCE, or designee, will immediately notify the 
protestor and the contracting officer of the date the protest was 
received and whether it will be processed or dismissed for lack of 
timeliness or specificity.
    (b) In cases where the protest is timely and sufficiently specific, 
the AA/SDBCE, or designee, will also immediately advise the protested 
concern of the protest and forward a copy of it to the protested 
concern.
    (1) The AA/SDBCE, or designee, is authorized to ask the protested 
concern to provide any or all of the following information and 
documentation, completed so as to show the circumstances existing on the 
date of self-representation: SBA Form 1010A, ``Statement of Personal 
Eligibility'' for each individual claiming disadvantaged status; SBA 
Form 1010B, ``Statement of Business Eligibility;'' SBA Form 413, 
``Personal Financial Statement,'' for each individual claiming 
disadvantaged status; information as to whether the protested concern, 
or any of its owners, officers or directors, have applied for admission 
to or participated in the SBA's 8(a) BD program and if so, the name of 
the company which applied or participated and the date of the 
application or entry into the program; business tax returns for the last 
two completed fiscal years prior to the date of self-representation; 
personal tax returns for the last two years prior to the date of self-
representation for all individuals claiming disadvantaged status, all 
officers, all directors and for any individual owning at least 10% of 
the business entity; annual business financial statements for the last 
two completed fiscal years prior to the date of self-representation; a 
current monthly or quarterly business financial statement no older than 
90 days; articles of incorporation; corporate by-laws; partnership 
agreements; limited liability company articles of organization; and any 
other relevant information as to whether the protested concern is 
disadvantaged.
    (2) SBA's disadvantaged status determination need not be limited to 
consideration only of the issues raised in the protest. SBA may consider 
other applicable criteria.
    (3) Unless the protest presents specific credible information which 
calls into question the veracity of application or other documents 
previously submitted to SBA by a current Participant in SBA's 8(a) BD 
program, SBA will allow the Participant to submit, in lieu of the 
information specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a sworn 
affidavit or declaration that circumstances concerning the ownership and 
control of the business and the disadvantaged status of its principals 
have not changed since its application or entry into the program or its 
most recent annual review, and a copy of its most recently completed 
annual review.
    (i) If the ownership or control of the business or the disadvantaged 
status of any principals have changed, the protested concern must comply 
with paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (ii) An affidavit or declaration may be allowed only if SBA admitted 
the protested concern to the 8(a) BD program, or conducted an annual 
review of the protested concern, during the 12month period preceding the 
date on which SBA receives the protest, and if

[[Page 294]]

proceedings to suspend, terminate or early graduate the concern from the 
8(a) BD program are not pending.
    (c) Within 10 working days of the date that notification of the 
protest was received from the AA/SDBCE or designee, the protested 
concern must submit to the AA/SDBCE or designee, by personal delivery, 
FAX, or mail, the information and documentation requested pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section or the affidavit permitted by paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section. Materials submitted must be received by the 
close of business on the 10th working day.
    (1) SBA will consider only materials submitted timely, and the late 
or non-submission of materials needed to make a disadvantaged status 
determination may result in sustaining the protest.
    (2) The burden is on the protested concern to demonstrate its 
disadvantaged status, whether or not it is currently shown on the list 
of qualified SDBs.
    (3) The protested concern must timely submit to SBA any information 
it deems relevant to a determination of its disadvantaged status.


<R05>
Sec. 124.1023  How does SBA make disadvantaged status determinations in considering an SDB protest?

    (a) General. The AA/SDBCE, or designee, will determine a protested 
concern's disadvantaged status within 15 working days after receipt of a 
protest. If the procuring activity contracting officer does not receive 
an SBA determination within 15 working days after the SBA's receipt of 
the protest, the contracting officer may presume that the challenged 
offeror is disadvantaged, unless the SBA requests and the contracting 
officer grants an extension to the 15-day response period.
    (b) Award after protest. (1) After receiving a protest involving an 
offeror being considered for award, the contracting officer shall not 
award the contract until:
    (i) The SBA has made an SDB determination, or
    (ii) 15 working days have expired since SBA's receipt of a protest 
and the contracting officer has not agreed to an extension of the 15-day 
response period.
    (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the 
contracting officer may award a contract after the receipt of an SDB 
protest where he or she determines in writing that an award must be made 
to protect the public interest.
    (c) Withdrawal of protest. If a protest is withdrawn, SBA will not 
complete a new disadvantaged status determination, and a previous SDB 
certification will stand.
    (d) Basis for determination. (1) Except with respect to a concern 
which is a current Participant in SBA's 8(a) BD program and is 
authorized under Sec. 124.1022(b)(3) to submit an affidavit concerning 
its disadvantaged status, the disadvantaged status determination will be 
based on the protest record, including reasonable inferences therefrom, 
as supplied by the protestor, protested concern, SBA or others.
    (2) SBA may in its discretion make a part of the protest record 
information already in its files, and information submitted by the 
protestor, the protested concern, the contracting officer, or other 
persons contacted for additional specific information.
    (e) Disadvantaged status. In evaluating the social and economic 
disadvantage of individuals claiming disadvantaged status, SBA will 
consider the same information and factors set forth in Secs. 124.103 and 
124.104. As provided in Sec. 124.1002(c), individuals claiming 
disadvantaged status must have a net worth that is less than $750,000, 
after taking into account the exclusions set forth in 
Sec. 124.104(c)(2).
    (f) Disadvantaged status determination. SBA will render a written 
determination including the basis for its findings and conclusions.
    (g) Notification of determination. After making its disadvantaged 
status determination, the SBA will immediately notify the contracting 
officer, the protestor, and the protested concern of its determination. 
SBA will promptly provide by certified mail, return receipt requested, a 
copy of its written determination to the same entities, consistent with 
law.

[[Page 295]]

    (h) Results of an SBA disadvantaged status determination. A 
disadvantaged status determination becomes effective immediately.
    (1) If the concern is found not to be disadvantaged, the 
determination remains in full force and effect unless reversed upon 
appeal by SBA's DADA/GC&MED, or designee, pursuant to Sec. 124.1024, or 
the concern is certified to be an SDB under Sec. 124.1008. The concern 
is precluded from applying for SDB certification for 12 months from the 
date of the final agency decision (whether by the AA/SDBCE, or designee, 
without an appeal, or by the DADA/GC&MED, or designee, on appeal).
    (2) If the concern is found to be disadvantaged, the determination 
remains in full force and effect unless and until reversed upon appeal 
by SBA's DADA/GC&MED, or designee, pursuant to Sec. 124.1024. A final 
Agency decision (whether by the AA/SDBCE, or designee, without an 
appeal, or by the DADA/GC&MED, or designee, on appeal) finding the 
protested concern to be an SDB remains in effect for three years from 
the date of the decision under the same conditions as if the concern had 
been granted SDB certification under Sec. 124.1008.


<R05>
Sec. 124.1024  Appeals of disadvantaged status determinations.

    (a) Who may appeal. Appeals of protest determinations may be filed 
with the SBA's DADA/GC&MED by the protested concern, the protestor, or 
the contracting officer.
    (b) Timeliness of appeal. An appeal must be in writing and must be 
received by the DADA/GC&MED no later than 5 working days after the date 
of receipt of the protest determination. SBA will dismiss any appeal 
received after the five-day time period.
    (c) Notice of appeal. Notice of the appeal must be provided by the 
party bringing an appeal to the procuring activity contracting officer 
and either the protested concern or original protestor, as appropriate.
    (d) Grounds for appeal. SBA will reexamine a protest determination 
only if there was a clear and significant error in the processing of the 
protest, or if the AA/SDBCE, or designee, failed to consider a 
significant material fact contained within the information supplied by 
the protestor or the protested concern. SBA will not consider protest 
determination appeals based on additional information or changed 
circumstances which were not disclosed at the time of the decision of 
the AA/SDBCE or designee, or which are based on disagreement with the 
findings and conclusions contained in the determination.
    (e) Contents of appeal. No specific format is required for the 
appeal. However, the appeal must identify the protest determination 
which is appealed, and set forth a full and specific statement as to why 
the determination is erroneous under paragraph (c) of this section.
    (f) Completion of appeal after award. An appeal may proceed to 
completion even though an award of the SDB acquisition or other 
procurement requirement which prompted the protest has been made, if so 
desired by the protested concern, or where SBA determines that a 
decision on appeal would have a material impact on contracting 
decisions, such as where the contracting officer agrees:
    (1) In the case where an award is made to a concern other than the 
protested concern, to terminate the contract and award to the protested 
concern if the appeal finds that the protested concern is disadvantaged; 
or
    (2) In the case where an award is made to the protested concern, to 
terminate the contract if the appeal finds that the protested concern is 
not disadvantaged.
    (g) The appeal will be decided by the DADA/GC&MED, within 5 working 
days of its receipt, if practicable.
    (h) The appeal decision will be based only on the information and 
documentation in the protest record as supplemented by the appeal. SBA 
will provide a copy of the decision to the contracting officer, the 
protestor, and the protested concern, consistent with law.
    (i) The decision of the DADA/GC&MED, is the final decision of the 
SBA, and cannot be further appealed to OHA.

<R05>
Sec. 125.1  Programs included.

    The regulations in this part relate to the Government contracting 
assistance programs of SBA. There are four main programs: Prime 
contracting assistance; Subcontracting assistance; Government property 
sales assistance; and the Certificate of Competency program. The 
objective of the programs is to assist small businesses in obtaining a 
fair share of Federal Government contracts, subcontracts, and property 
sales.


<R05>
Sec. 125.2  Prime contracting assistance.

    (a) Traditional PCR responsibilities. (1) SBA Procurement Center 
Representatives (PCRs) are located at Federal agencies and buying 
activities which have major contracting programs. PCRs review all 
acquisitions not set aside for small businesses, including HUBZone small 
business concerns, to determine whether a set-aside would be 
appropriate. In cases where there is disagreement between a PCR and the 
contracting officer over the suitability of a particular acquisition for 
a small business set-aside, the PCR may initiate an appeal to the head 
of the contracting activity. If the head of the contracting activity 
agrees with the contracting officer, SBA may appeal to the secretary of 
the department or head of the agency. The procedures and time limits for 
such appeals are set forth in Sec. 19.505 of the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation (FAR) (48 CFR 19.505).
    (2) PCRs review and evaluate the small business programs of Federal 
agencies and buying activities and make recommendations for improvement. 
They also recommend small business, small women-owned business, and 
small disadvantaged business sources for use by contracting activities 
and assist these businesses in obtaining Federal contracts and 
subcontracts. Other authorized duties of a PCR are set forth in the FAR 
in 48 CFR 19.402(c) and in the Small Business Act (the Act) in Section 
15(a) (15 U.S.C. 644(a)).
    (b) BPCR responsibilities. (1) SBA is required by section 403 of 
Public Law 98-577 (15 U.S.C. 644(l)) to assign a breakout PCR (BPCR) to 
major contracting centers. A major contracting center is a center that, 
as determined by SBA, purchases substantial dollar amounts of other than 
commercial items, and which has the potential to achieve significant 
savings as a result of the assignment of a BPCR.
    (2) BPCRs advocate full and open competition in the Federal 
contracting process and recommend the breakout for competition of items 
and requirements which previously have not been competed. They may 
appeal the failure by the buying activity to act favorably on a 
recommendation in accord with the appeal procedures set forth in 
Sec. 19.505 of the FAR (48 CFR 19.505). BPCRs also review restrictions 
and obstacles to competition and make recommendations for improvement. 
Other authorized functions of a BPCR are set forth in 48 CFR 19.403(c) 
of the FAR and Section 15(l) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 644(l)).

Sec. 125.3  Subcontracting assistance.

    (a) The purpose of the subcontracting assistance program is to 
achieve maximum utilization of small business by major prime 
contractors. The Act requires other-than-small firms awarded contracts 
that offer subcontracting possibilities by the Federal Government in 
excess of $500,000, or $1 million for construction of a public facility, 
to submit a subcontracting plan to the contracting agency. The FAR sets 
forth the requirements for subcontracting plans in 48 CFR part 19, 
subpart 19.7, and 48 CFR 52.219-9.

[[Page 297]]

    (b) Upon determination of the successful subcontract offeror on a 
subcontract for which a small business, small disadvantaged business, 
and/or a HUBZone small business received a preference, but prior to 
award, the prime contractor must inform each unsuccessful offeror in 
writing of the name and location of the apparent successful offeror and 
if the successful offeror was a small business, small disadvantaged 
business, or HUBZone business. This applies to all subcontracts over 
$10,000.
    (c) SBA Commercial Market Representatives (CMRs) facilitate the 
process of matching large prime contractors with small, small 
disadvantaged, and HUBZone subcontractors. CMRs identify, develop, and 
market small businesses to the prime contractors and assist the small 
concerns in obtaining subcontracts.
    (d) Each CMR has a portfolio of prime contractors and conducts 
periodic compliance reviews and needs assessments of the companies in 
this portfolio. CMRs are also required to perform opportunity 
development and source identification. Opportunity development means 
assessing the current and future needs of the prime contractors. Source 
identification means identifying those small, small disadvantaged, and 
HUBZone concerns which can fulfill the needs assessed from the 
opportunity development process.

<R05>
Sec. 125.4  Government property sales assistance.

    (a) The purpose of SBA's Government property sales assistance 
program is to:
    (1) Insure that small businesses obtain their fair share of all 
Federal real and personal property qualifying for sale or other 
competitive disposal action; and
    (2) Assist small businesses in obtaining Federal property being 
processed for disposal, sale, or lease.
    (b) SBA property sales assistance primarily consists of two 
activities:
    (1) Obtaining small business set-asides when necessary to insure 
that a fair share of Government property sales are made to small 
businesses; and
    (2) Providing advice and assistance to small businesses on all 
matters pertaining to sale or lease of Government property.
    (c) The program is intended to cover the following categories of 
Government property:
    (1) Sales of timber and related forest products;
    (2) Sales of strategic material from national stockpiles;
    (3) Sales of royalty oil by the Department of Interior's Minerals 
Management Service;
    (4) Leases involving rights to minerals, petroleum, coal, and 
vegetation; and
    (5) Sales of surplus real and personal property.
    (d) SBA has established specific small business size standards and 
rules for the sale or lease of the different kinds of Government 
property. These provisions are contained in Secs. 121.501 through 
121.514 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 125.5  Certificate of Competency Program.

    (a) General. (1) The Certificate of Competency (COC) Program is 
authorized under section 8(b)(7) of the Small Business Act. A COC is a 
written instrument issued by SBA to a Government contracting officer, 
certifying that one or more named small business concerns possess the 
responsibility to perform a specific Government procurement (or sale) 
contract. The COC Program is applicable to all Government procurement 
actions. For purposes of this Section, the term ``United States'' 
includes its territories, possessions, and the Commonwealth of Puerto 
Rico.
    (2) A contracting officer must, upon determining an apparent low 
small business offeror to be nonresponsible, refer that small business 
to SBA for a possible COC, even if the next low apparently responsible 
offeror is also a small business.
    (3) A small business offeror referred to SBA as nonresponsible may 
apply to SBA for a COC. Where the applicant is a non-manufacturing 
offeror on a supply contract, the COC applies to the responsibility of 
the non-manufacturer, not to that of the manufacturer.

[[Page 298]]

    (b) COC Eligibility. (1) The offeror seeking a COC has the burden of 
proof to demonstrate its eligibility for COC review. To be eligible for 
the COC program, a firm must meet the following criteria:
    (i) It must qualify as a small business concern under the size 
standard applicable to the procurement. Where the solicitation fails to 
specify a size standard or Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) 
code, SBA will assign the appropriate size standard to determine COC 
eligibility. SBA determines size eligibility as of the date described in 
Sec. 121.404 of this chapter.
    (ii) A manufacturing, service, or construction concern must 
demonstrate that it will perform a significant portion of the proposed 
contract with its own facilities, equipment, and personnel. The contract 
must be performed or the end item manufactured within the United States.
    (iii) A non-manufacturer making an offer on a small business set-
aside contract for supplies must furnish end items that have been 
manufactured in the United States by a small business. A waiver of this 
requirement may be requested under Secs. 121.1301 through 121.1305 of 
this chapter for either the type of product being procured or the 
specific contract at issue.
    (iv) A non-manufacturer making an offer on an unrestricted 
procurement or a procurement utilizing simplified acquisition threshold 
procedures with a cost that does not exceed $25,000 must furnish end 
items manufactured in the United States to be eligible for a COC.
    (v) An offeror intending to provide a kit consisting of finished 
components or other components provided for a special purpose, is 
eligible if:
    (A) It meets the Size Standard for the SIC code assigned to the 
procurement;
    (B) Each component comprising the kit was manufactured in the United 
States; and
    (C) In the case of a set-aside, each component comprising the kit 
was manufactured by a small business under the size standard applicable 
to the component provided. A waiver of this requirement may be requested 
under Secs. 121.1301 through 121.1305 of this chapter.
    (2) SBA will determine a concern ineligible for a COC if the 
concern, or any of its principals, appears in the ``Parties Excluded 
From Federal Procurement Programs'' section found in the U.S. General 
Services Administration Office of Acquisition Policy Publication: List 
of Parties Excluded From Federal Procurement or Nonprocurement Programs. 
If a principal is unable to presently control the applicant concern, and 
appears in the Procurement section of the list due to matters not 
directly related to the concern itself, responsibility will be 
determined in accordance with paragraph (f)(2) of this section.
    (3) An eligibility determination will be made on a case-by-case 
basis, where a concern or any of its principals appears in the 
Nonprocurement Section of the publication referred to in paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section.
    (c) Referral of nonresponsibility determination to SBA. (1) A 
contracting officer who determines that an apparently successful offeror 
that has certified itself to be a small business with respect to a 
specific Government procurement lacks any element of responsibility 
(including competency, capability, capacity, credit, integrity or 
tenacity or perseverance) must refer the matter in writing to the SBA 
Government Contracting Area Office (Area Office) serving the area in 
which the headquarters of the offeror is located. The referral must 
include a copy of the following:
    (i) Solicitation;
    (ii) Offer submitted by the concern whose responsibility is at issue 
for the procurement (its Best and Final Offer for a negotiated 
procurement);
    (iii) Abstract of Bids, where applicable, or the Contracting 
Officer's Price Negotiation Memorandum;
    (iv) Preaward survey, where applicable;
    (v) Contracting officer's written determination of 
nonresponsibility;
    (vi) Technical data package (including drawings, specifications, and 
Statement of Work); and
    (vii) Any other justification and documentation used to arrive at 
the nonresponsibility determination.
    (2) Contract award must be withheld by the contracting officer for a 
period

[[Page 299]]

of 15 working days (or longer if agreed to by SBA and the contracting 
officer) following receipt by the appropriate Area Office of a referral 
which includes all required documentation.
    (3) The COC referral must indicate that the offeror has been found 
responsive to the solicitation, and also identify the reasons for the 
nonresponsibility determination.
    (d) Application for COC. (1) Upon receipt of the contracting 
officer's referral, the Area Office will inform the concern of the 
contracting officer's negative responsibility determination, and offer 
it the opportunity to apply to SBA for a COC by a specified date.
    (2) The COC application must include all information and 
documentation requested by SBA and any additional information which the 
firm believes will demonstrate its ability to perform on the proposed 
contract. The application should be returned as soon as possible, but no 
later than the date specified by SBA.
    (3) Upon receipt of a complete and acceptable application, SBA may 
elect to visit the applicant's facility to review its responsibility. 
SBA personnel may obtain clarification or confirmation of information 
provided by the applicant by directly contacting suppliers, financial 
institutions, and other third parties upon whom the applicant's 
responsibility depends.
    (e) Incomplete applications. If an application for a COC is 
materially incomplete or is not submitted by the date specified by SBA, 
SBA will close the case without issuing a COC and will notify the 
contracting officer and the concern with a declination letter.
    (f) Reviewing an application. (1) The COC review process is not 
limited to the areas of nonresponsibility cited by the contracting 
officer. SBA may, at its discretion, independently evaluate the COC 
applicant for all elements of responsibility, but it may presume 
responsibility exists as to elements other than those cited as 
deficient. SBA may deny a COC for reasons of nonresponsibility not 
originally cited by the contracting officer.
    (2) A small business will be rebuttably presumed nonresponsible if 
any of the following circumstances are shown to exist:
    (i) Within three years before the application for a COC, the 
concern, or any of its principals, has been convicted of an offense or 
offenses that would constitute grounds for debarment or suspension under 
FAR subpart 9.4 (48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4), and the matter is still 
under the jurisdiction of a court (e.g., the principals of a concern are 
incarcerated, on probation or parole, or under a suspended sentence); or
    (ii) Within three years before the application for a COC, the 
concern or any of its principals has had a civil judgment entered 
against it or them for any reason that would constitute grounds for 
debarment or suspension under FAR subpart 9.4 (48 CFR part, subpart 
9.4).
    (g) Decision by Area Director (``Director''). After reviewing the 
information submitted by the applicant and the information gathered by 
SBA, the Area Director will make a determination, either final or 
recommended as set forth in the following chart:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                 SBA official or         Finality of

                                                     decision.

                               right of appeal and   under paragraph (h)
                               other options.        or paragraph (i) of

                               approval.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (h) Notification of intent to issue on a contract with a value 
between $100,000 and $25 million. Where the Director determines that a 
COC is warranted, he

[[Page 300]]

or she will notify the contracting officer of the intent to issue a COC, 
and of the reasons for that decision, prior to issuing the COC. At the 
time of notification, the contracting officer has the following options:
    (1) Accept the Director's decision to issue the COC and award the 
contract to the concern. The COC issuance letter will then be sent, 
including as an attachment a detailed rationale of the decision; or
    (2) Ask the Director to suspend the case for one of the following 
purposes:
    (i) To forward a detailed rationale for the decision to the 
contracting officer for review within a specified period of time;
    (ii) To afford the contracting officer the opportunity to meet with 
the Area Office to review all documentation contained in the case file;
    (iii) To submit any information which the contracting officer 
believes SBA has not considered (at which time, SBA will establish a new 
suspense date mutually agreeable to the contracting officer and SBA); or
    (iv) To permit resolution of an appeal by the contracting agency to 
SBA Headquarters under paragraph (i) of this section.
    (i) Appeals of Area Director determinations. For COC actions with a 
value exceeding $100,000, contracting agencies may appeal a Director's 
decision to issue a COC to SBA Headquarters by filing an appeal with the 
Area Office processing the COC application. The Area Office must honor 
the request to appeal if the contracting officer agrees to withhold 
award until the appeal process is concluded. Without such an agreement 
from the contracting officer, the Director must issue the COC. When such 
an agreement has been obtained, the Area Office will immediately forward 
the case file to SBA Headquarters.
    (1) The intent of the appeal procedure is to allow the contracting 
agency the opportunity to submit to SBA Headquarters any documentation 
which the Area Office may not have considered.
    (2) SBA Headquarters will furnish written notice to the Director, 
Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) at the 
secretariat level of the procuring agency (with a copy to the 
contracting officer), that the case file has been received and that an 
appeal decision may be requested by an authorized official at that 
level. If the contracting agency decides to file an appeal, it must 
notify SBA Headquarters through its Director, OSDBU, within 10 working 
days (or a time period agreed upon by both agencies) of its receipt of 
the notice under paragraph (h) of this section. The appeal and any 
supporting documentation must be filed within 10 working days (or a 
different time period agreed to by both agencies) after SBA receives the 
request for a formal appeal.
    (3) The SBA Associate Administrator for Government Contracting (AA/
GC) will make a final determination, in writing, to issue or to deny the 
COC.
    (j) Decision by SBA Headquarters where contract value exceeds $25 
million. (1) Prior to taking final action, SBA Headquarters will contact 
the contracting agency at the secretariat level or agency equivalent and 
afford it the following options:
    (i) Ask SBA Headquarters to suspend the case so that the agency can 
meet with Headquarters personnel and review all documentation contained 
in the case file; or
    (ii) Submit to SBA Headquarters for evaluation any information which 
the contracting agency believes has not been considered.
    (2) After reviewing all available information, the AA/GC will make a 
final decision to either issue or deny the COC. If the AA/GC's decision 
is to deny the COC, the applicant and contracting agency will be 
informed in writing by the Area Office. If the decision is to issue the 
COC, a letter certifying the responsibility of the firm will be sent to 
the contracting agency by Headquarters and the applicant will be 
informed of such issuance by the Area Office. Except as set forth in 
paragraph (l) of this section, there can be no further appeal or 
reconsideration of the decision of the AA/GC.
    (k) Notification of denial of COC. The notification to an 
unsuccessful applicant following either an Area Director or a 
Headquarters denial of a COC will briefly state all reasons for denial 
and inform the applicant that a meeting may be requested with 
appropriate

[[Page 301]]

SBA personnel to discuss the denial. Upon receipt of a request for such 
a meeting, the appropriate SBA personnel will confer with the applicant 
and explain the reasons for SBA's action. The meeting does not 
constitute an opportunity to rebut the merits of the SBA's decision to 
deny the COC, and is for the sole purpose of giving the applicant the 
opportunity to correct deficiencies so as to improve its ability to 
obtain future contracts either directly or, if necessary, through the 
issuance of a COC.
    (l) Reconsideration of COC after issuance. (1) An approved COC may 
be reconsidered and possibly rescinded, at the sole discretion of SBA, 
where an award of the contract has not occurred, and one of the 
following circumstances exists:
    (i) The COC applicant submitted false or omitted materially adverse 
information;
    (ii) New materially adverse information has been received relating 
to the current responsibility of the applicant concern; or
    (iii) The COC has been issued for more than 60 days (in which case 
SBA may investigate the firm's current circumstances).
    (2) Where SBA reconsiders and reaffirms the COC the procedures under 
paragraph (h) of this section do not apply.
    (m) Effect of a COC. By the terms of the Act, a COC is conclusive as 
to responsibility. Where SBA issues a COC on behalf of a small business 
with respect to a particular contract, contracting officers are required 
to award the contract without requiring the firm to meet any other 
requirement with respect to responsibility.
    (n) Effect of Denial of COC. Denial of a COC by SBA does not 
preclude a contracting officer from awarding a contract to the referred 
firm, nor does it prevent the concern from making an offer on any other 
procurement.
    (o) Monitoring performance. Once a COC has been issued and a 
contract awarded on that basis, SBA will monitor contractor performance.

Sec. 125.6  Prime contractor performance requirements (limitations on subcontracting).

    (a) In order to be awarded a full or partial small business set-
aside contract, an 8(a) contract, or an unrestricted procurement where a 
concern has claimed a 10 percent small disadvantaged business (SDB) 
price evaluation preference, a small business concern must agree that:
    (1) In the case of a contract for services (except construction), 
the concern will perform at least 50 percent of the cost of the contract 
incurred for personnel with its own employees.
    (2) In the case of a contract for supplies or products (other than 
procurement from a non-manufacturer in such supplies or products), the 
concern will perform at least 50 percent of the cost of manufacturing 
the supplies or products (not including the costs of materials).
    (3) In the case of a contract for general construction, the concern 
will perform at least 15 percent of the cost of the contract with its 
own employees (not including the costs of materials).
    (4) In the case of a contract for construction by special trade 
contractors, the concern will perform at least 25 percent of the cost of 
the contract with its own employees (not including the cost of 
materials).
    (b) Definitions. The following definitions apply to this section:
    (1) Cost of the contract. All allowable direct and indirect costs 
allocable to the contract, excluding profit or fees.
    (2) Cost of contract performance incurred for personnel. Direct 
labor costs and any overhead which has only direct labor as its base, 
plus the concern's General and Administrative rate multiplied by the 
labor cost.
    (3) Cost of manufacturing. Those costs incurred by the firm in the 
production of the end item being acquired. These are costs associated 
with the manufacturing process, including the direct costs of 
fabrication, assembly, or other production activities, and indirect 
costs which are allocable and allowable. The cost of materials, as well 
as the profit or fee from the contract, are excluded.

[[Page 302]]

    (4) Cost of materials. Includes costs of the items purchased, 
handling and associated shipping costs for the purchased items (which 
includes raw materials), off-the-shelf items (and similar 
proportionately high-cost common supply items requiring additional 
manufacturing or incorporation to become end items), special tooling, 
special testing equipment, and construction equipment purchased for and 
required to perform on the contract. In the case of a supply contract, 
the acquisition of services or products from outside sources following 
normal commercial practices within the industry are also included.
    (5) Off-the-shelf item. An item produced and placed in stock by a 
manufacturer, or stocked by a distributor, before orders or contracts 
are received for its sale. The item may be commercial or may be produced 
to military or Federal specifications or description. Off-the-shelf 
items are also known as Nondevelopmental Items (NDI).
    (6) Personnel. Individuals who are ``employees'' under Sec. 121.106 
of this chapter.
    (7) Subcontracting. That portion of the contract performed by a 
firm, other than the concern awarded the contract, under a second 
contract, purchase order, or agreement for any parts, supplies, 
components, or subassemblies which are not available off-the-shelf, and 
which are manufactured in accordance with drawings, specifications, or 
designs furnished by the contractor, or by the government as a portion 
of the solicitation. Raw castings, forgings, and moldings are considered 
as materials, not as subcontracting costs. Where the prime contractor 
has been directed by the Government to use any specific source for 
parts, supplies, components subassemblies or services, the costs 
associated with those purchases will be considered as part of the cost 
of materials, not subcontracting costs.
    (c) Compliance will be considered an element of responsibility and 
not a component of size eligibility.
    (d) The period of time used to determine compliance will be the 
period of performance which the evaluating agency uses to evaluate the 
proposal or bid. If the evaluating agency fails to articulate in its 
solicitation the period of performance it will use to evaluate the 
proposal or bid, the base contract period, excluding options, will be 
used to determine compliance. In indefinite quantity contracts, 
performance over the guaranteed minimum will be used to determine 
compliance unless the evaluating agency articulates a different period 
of performance which it will use to evaluate the proposal or bid in its 
solicitation.
    (e) Work to be performed by subsidiaries or other affiliates of a 
concern is not counted as being performed by the concern for purposes of 
determining whether the concern will perform the required percentage of 
work.
    (f) The procedures of Sec. 125.5 apply where the contracting officer 
determines non-compliance, the procurement is a full or partial small 
business set-aside or an SDB has claimed a preference, and refers the 
matter to SBA for a COC determination.

$50,000 if:
    (i) In the case of a procurement for manufactured or supply items:
    (A) The buying activity is located within the geographical area 
served by a designated SBA district, and
    (B) There is a reasonable expectation of obtaining offers from two

District Offices will be treated as one designated SBA district for the 
purposes of this section.
    (3) If the contracting officer determines that there is not a 
reasonable expectation of receiving at least two responsible offers from 
VSB concerns headquartered within the geographic area served by the 
applicable designated SBA district, he or she must include in the 
contract file the reason(s) for this determination, and solicit the

19.505.
    (4) If the contracting officer receives only one acceptable offer 
from a responsible VSB concern in response to a VSB set-aside, the

<R04>
          Subpart B--Requirements to be a Qualified HUBZone SBC


<R05>
Sec. 126.200  What requirements must a concern meet to receive SBA certification as a qualified HUBZone SBC?

    (a) The concern must be a HUBZone SBC as defined in Sec. 126.103; 
and
    (b) At least 35 percent of the concern's employees must reside in a 
HUBZone, and the HUBZone SBC must certify that it will attempt to 
maintain this percentage during the performance of any HUBZone contract 
it receives. When determining the percentage of employees that reside in 
a HUBZone, if the percentage results in a fraction round up to the 
nearest whole number,

    Example 1: A concern has 25 employees, 35 percent or 8.75 employees 
must reside in a HUBZone. Thus, 9 employees must reside in a HUBZone.
    Example 2: A concern has 95 employees, 35 percent or 33.25 employees 
must reside in a HUBZone. Thus, 34 employees must reside in a HUBZone.


and

    (c) The HUBZone SBC must certify that it will ensure that it will 
comply with certain contract performance requirements in connection with 
contracts awarded to it as a qualified HUBZone SBC, as set forth in 
Sec. 126.700.


<R05>
Sec. 126.201  For this purpose, who does SBA consider to own a HUBZone SBC?

    An owner of a HUBZone SBC is a person who owns any legal or 
equitable interest in such HUBZone SBC. More specifically:
    (a) Corporations. SBA will consider any person who owns stock, 
whether voting or non-voting, to be an owner. SBA will consider options 
to purchase stock to have been exercised. SBA will consider the right to 
convert debentures into voting stock to have been exercised.
    (b) Partnerships. SBA will consider a partner, whether general or 
limited, to be an owner if that partner owns an equitable interest in 
the partnership.
    (c) Sole proprietorships. The proprietor is the owner.
    (d) Limited liability companies. SBA will consider each member to be 
an owner of a limited liability company.

    Example 1: All stock of a corporation is owned by U.S. citizens. The 
president of the corporation, a non-U.S. citizen, owns no stock in the 
corporation, but owns options to purchase stock in the corporation. SBA 
will consider the option exercised, and the corporation is not eligible 
to be a qualified HUBZone SBC.
    Example 2: A partnership is owned 99.9 percent by persons who are 
U.S. citizens, and 0.1 percent by someone who is not. The partnership is 
not eligible because it is not 100 percent owned by U.S. citizens.


<R05>
Sec. 126.202  Who does SBA consider to control a HUBZone SBC?

    Control means both the day-to-day management and long-term 
decisionmaking authority for the HUBZone SBC. Many persons share control 
of a concern, including each of those occupying the following positions: 
officer, director, general partner, managing partner, and manager. In 
addition, key employees who possess critical licenses, expertise or 
responsibilities related to the concern's primary economic activity may 
share significant control of the concern. SBA will consider the control 
potential of such key employees on a case by case basis.


<R05>
Sec. 126.203  What size standards apply to HUBZone SBCs?

    (a) At time of application for certification. A HUBZone SBC must 
meet SBA's size standards for its primary industry classification as 
defined in Sec. 121.201 of this title. If SBA is unable to verify that a 
concern is small, SBA may deny the concern status as a qualified HUBZone 
SBC, or SBA may request a formal size determination from the responsible 
Government Contracting Area Director or designee.
    (b) At time of contract offer. A HUBZone SBC must be small within 
the size standard corresponding to the SIC code assigned to the 
contract.

[[Page 309]]


<R05>
Sec. 126.204  May a qualified HUBZone SBC have affiliates?

    Yes. A qualified HUBZone SBC may have affiliates so long as the 
affiliates are also qualified HUBZone SBCs, 8(a) participants, or WOBs.


<R05>
Sec. 126.205  May WOBs, 8(a) participants or SDBs be qualified HUBZone SBCs?

    Yes. WOBs, 8(a) participants, and SDBs can qualify as HUBZone SBCs 
if they meet the additional requirements in this part.


<R05>
Sec. 126.206  May non-manufacturers be qualified HUBZone SBCs?

    Yes. Non-manufacturers (referred to in the HUBZone Act of 1997 as 
``regular dealers'') may be certified as qualified HUBZone SBCs if they 
meet all the requirements set forth in Sec. 126.200 and they can 
demonstrate that they can provide the product or products manufactured 
by qualified HUBZone SBCs. ``Non-manufacturer'' is defined in 
Sec. 121.406(b)(1) of this title.


<R05>
Sec. 126.207  May a qualified HUBZone SBC have offices or facilities in another HUBZone or outside a HUBZone?

    Yes. A qualified HUBZone SBC may have offices or facilities in 
another HUBZone or even outside a HUBZone and still be a qualified 
HUBZone SBC. However, in order to qualify, the concern's principal 
office must be located in a HUBZone.


<R04>
                        Subpart C--Certification


<R05>
Sec. 126.300  How may a concern be certified as a qualified HUBZone SBC?

    A concern must apply to SBA for certification. The application must 
include a representation that it meets the eligibility requirements 
described in Sec. 126.200 and must submit relevant supporting 
information. SBA will consider the information provided by the concern 
in order to determine whether the concern qualifies. SBA, in its sole 
discretion, may rely solely upon the information submitted to establish 
eligibility, or may request additional information, or may verify the 
information before making a determination. If SBA determines that the 
concern is a qualified HUBZone SBC, it will issue a certification to 
that effect and add the concern to the List.


<R05>
Sec. 126.301  Is there any other way for a concern to obtain certification?

    No. SBA certification is the only way to qualify for HUBZone program 
status.


<R05>
Sec. 126.302  When may a concern apply for certification?

    A concern may apply to SBA and submit the required information 
whenever it can represent that it meets the eligibility requirements, 
subject to Sec. 126.309. All representations and supporting information 
contained in the application must be complete and accurate as of the 
date of submission. The application must be signed by an officer of the 
concern who is authorized to represent the concern.


<R05>
Sec. 126.303  Where must a concern file its certification?

    The concern must file its certification with the AA/HUB, U.S. Small 
Business Administration, 409 Third Street, SW, Washington, DC 20416.


<R05>
Sec. 126.304  What must a concern submit to SBA?

    (a) To be certified by SBA as a qualified HUBZone SBC, a concern 
must represent to SBA that under the definitions set forth in 
Sec. 126.103:
    (1) It is a small business concern that is both owned only by United 
States citizens and controlled only by United States citizens;
    (2) Its principal office is located in a HUBZone;
    (3) Not less than 35 percent of its employees reside in a HUBZone;
    (4) It will use good faith efforts to ensure that a minimum 
percentage of 35 percent of its employees continue to reside in a 
HUBZone so long as SBA certifies it as qualified and during the 
performance of any contract awarded to it on the basis of its status as 
a qualified HUBZone SBC; and
    (5) It will ensure that, where it enters into subcontracts to aid in 
performance of any prime contracts awarded to it because of its status 
as a qualified HUBZone SBC, it will incur not less than a certain 
minimum percentage of

[[Page 310]]

certain contract costs as set forth in Sec. 126.700.
    (b) If the concern is applying for HUBZone status based on a 
location within the external boundaries of an Indian reservation, the 
concern must submit with its application for certification official 
documentation from the appropriate Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Land 
Titles and Records Office with jurisdiction over the concern's area, 
confirming that it is located within the external boundaries of an 
Indian reservation. BIA lists the Land Titles and Records Offices and 
their jurisdiction in 25 CFR 150.4 and 150.5. In cases where BIA is 
unable to verify whether the business is located within the external 
boundaries of an Indian reservation, applicants should contact the AA/
HUB and SBA will assist them.
    (c) In addition to these representations, the concern must submit 
the forms, attachments, and any additional information required by SBA.


<R05>
Sec. 126.305  What format must the certification to SBA take?

    A concern must submit the required information in either a written 
or electronic application form provided by SBA. An electronic 
application must be sufficiently authenticated for enforcement purposes.


<R05>
Sec. 126.306  How will SBA process the certification?

    (a) The AA/HUB is authorized to approve or decline certifications. 
SBA will receive and review all certifications, but SBA will not process 
incomplete packages. SBA will make its determination within 30 calendar 
days after receipt of a complete package whenever practicable. The 
decision of the AA/HUB is the final agency decision.
    (b) SBA will base its certification on facts existing on the date of 
submission. SBA, in its sole discretion, may request additional 
information or clarification of information contained in the submission 
at any time.
    (c) If SBA approves the application, SBA will send a written notice 
to the concern and automatically enter it on the List described in 
Sec. 126.307.
    (d) A decision to deny eligibility must be in writing and state the 
specific reasons for denial.


<R05>
Sec. 126.307  Where will SBA maintain the List of qualified HUBZone SBCs?

    SBA maintains the List at its Internet website at http://
www.sba.gov/HUB. Requesters also may obtain a copy of the List by 
writing to the AA/HUB at U.S. Small Business Administration, 409 Third 
Street, SW, Washington, DC 20416 or via e-mail at aahub@sba.gov.


<R05>
Sec. 126.308  What happens if SBA inadvertently omits a qualified HUBZone SBC from the List?

    A HUBZone SBC that has received SBA's notice of certification, but 
is not on the List within 10 business days thereafter should immediately 
notify the AA/HUB in writing at U.S. Small Business Administration, 409 
Third Street, SW, Washington, DC 20416 or via e-mail at aahub@sba.gov. 
The concern must appear on the List to be eligible for HUBZone 
contracts.


<R05>
Sec. 126.309  How may a declined or de-certified concern seek certification at a later date?

    A concern that SBA has declined or de-certified may seek 
certification no sooner than one year from the date of decline or de-
certification if it believes that it has overcome all reasons for 
decline through changed circumstances, and is currently eligible.


<R04>
                     Subpart D--Program Examinations


<R05>
Sec. 126.400  Who will conduct program examinations?

    SBA field staff or others designated by the AA/HUB will conduct 
program examinations.


<R05>
Sec. 126.401  What will SBA examine?

    (a) Eligibility. Examiners will verify that the qualified HUBZone 
SBC met the requirements set forth in Sec. 126.200 at the time of its 
application for certification and at the time of examination.
    (b) Scope of review. Examiners may review any information related to 
the HUBZone SBC qualifying requirements, including documentation related 
to the location and ownership of the

[[Page 311]]

concern, the employee percentage requirements, and the concern's attempt 
to maintain this percentage. The qualified HUBZone SBC must document 
each employee's residence address through employment records. The 
examiner also may review property tax, public utility or postal records, 
and other relevant documents. The concern must retain documentation 
demonstrating satisfaction of the employee residence and other 
qualifying requirements for 6 years from date of submission to SBA.


<R05>
Sec. 126.402  When may SBA conduct program examinations?

    SBA may conduct a program examination at the time the concern 
certifies to SBA that it meets the requirements of the program or at any 
other time while the concern is on the List or subsequent to receipt of 
HUBZone contract benefits. For example, SBA may conduct a program 
examination to verify eligibility upon notification of a material change 
under Sec. 126.501. Additionally, SBA, in its sole discretion, may 
perform random program examinations to determine continuing compliance 
with program requirements, or it may conduct a program examination in 
response to credible information calling into question the HUBZone 
status of a small business concern. For protests to the HUBZone status 
of a small business concern in regard to a particular procurement, see 
Sec. 126.800.


<R05>
Sec. 126.403  May SBA require additional information from a HUBZone SBC?

    Yes. At the discretion of the AA/HUB, SBA has the right to require 
that a HUBZone SBC submit additional information as part of the 
certification process, or at any time thereafter. If SBA finds a HUBZone 
SBC is not qualified, SBA will de-certify the concern and delete its 
name from the List. SBA may choose to pursue penalties against any 
concern that has made material misrepresentations in its submissions to 
SBA in accordance with Sec. 126.900.


<R05>
Sec. 126.404  What happens if SBA is unable to verify a qualified HUBZone SBC's eligibility?

    (a) Authorized SBA headquarters personnel will first notify the 
concern in writing of the reasons why it is no longer eligible.
    (b) The concern will have 10 business days from the date that it 
receives notification to respond.
    (c) The AA/HUB will consider the reasons for proposed de-
certification and the concern's response before making a decision 
whether to de-certify. The AA/HUB's decision is the final agency 
decision.


<R05>
Sec. 126.405  What happens if SBA verifies eligibility?

    If SBA verifies that the concern is eligible, it will amend the date 
of certification on the List to reflect the date of verification.


<R04>
                  Subpart E--Maintaining HUBZone Status


<R05>
Sec. 126.500  How does a qualified HUBZone SBC maintain HUBZone status?

    (a) Any qualified HUBZone SBC wishing to remain on the List must 
self-certify annually to SBA that it remains a qualified HUBZone SBC.
    (b) Concerns wishing to remain in the program without any 
interruption must self-certify their continued eligibility to SBA within 
30 calendar days after each annual anniversary of their date of 
certification. Failure to do so will result in SBA de-certifying the 
concern. The concern then would have to submit a new application for 
certification under Secs. 126.300 through 126.306.
    (c) The self-certification to SBA must be in writing and must 
represent that the circumstances relative to eligibility which existed 
on the date of certification showing on the List have not materially 
changed.


<R05>
Sec. 126.501  What are a qualified HUBZone SBC's ongoing obligations to SBA?

    The concern must immediately notify SBA of any material change which 
could affect its eligibility. The notification must be in writing, and 
must be sent or delivered to the AA/HUB to comply with this requirement. 
Failure of a qualified HUBZone SBC to notify SBA of such a material 
change will result in immediate de-certification and removal from the 
List, and SBA may

[[Page 312]]

seek the imposition of penalties under Sec. 126.900. If the concern 
later becomes eligible for the program, the concern must apply for 
certification pursuant to Secs. 126.300 through 126.309 and must include 
with its application for certification a full explanation of why it 
failed to notify SBA of the material change. If SBA is not satisfied 
with the explanation provided, SBA may decline to certify the concern 
pursuant to Sec. 126.306.


<R05>
Sec. 126.502  Is there a limit to the length of time a qualified HUBZone SBC may be on the List?

    There is no limit to the length of time a qualified HUBZone SBC may 
remain on the List so long as it continues to follow the provisions of 
Secs. 126.200, 126.500, and 126.501.


<R05>
Sec. 126.503  When is a concern removed from the List?

    If SBA determines at any time that a HUBZone SBC is not qualified, 
SBA may de-certify the HUBZone SBC, remove the concern from the List, 
and seek imposition of penalties pursuant to Sec. 126.900. An adverse 
finding in the resolution of a protest also may result in de-
certification and removal from the List, and the imposition of penalties 
pursuant to Sec. 126.900. Failure to notify SBA of a material change 
which could affect a concern's eligibility will result in immediate de-
certification, removal from the List, and SBA may seek the imposition of 
penalties under Sec. 126.900.


<R04>
                    Subpart F--Contractual Assistance


<R05>
Sec. 126.600  What are HUBZone contracts?

    HUBZone contracts are contracts awarded to a qualified HUBZone SBC 
through any of the following procurement methods:
    (a) Sole source awards to qualified HUBZone SBCs;
    (b) Set-aside awards based on competition restricted to qualified 
HUBZone SBCs; or
    (c) Awards to qualified HUBZone SBCs through full and open 
competition after a price evaluation preference in favor of qualified 
HUBZone SBCs.


<R05>
Sec. 126.601  What additional requirements must a qualified HUBZone SBC meet to bid on a contract?

    (a) In order to submit an offer on a specific HUBZone contract, a 
concern must be small under the size standard corresponding to the SIC 
code assigned to the contract.
    (b) At the time a qualified HUBZone SBC submits its offer on a 
specific contract, it must certify to the contracting officer that
    (1) It is a qualified HUBZone SBC which appears on SBA's List;
    (2) There has been no material change in its circumstances since the 
date of certification shown on the List which could affect its HUBZone 
eligibility; and
    (3) It is small under the SIC code assigned to the procurement.
    (c) If bidding as a joint venture, each qualified HUBZone SBC must 
make the certifications in paragraphs (b)(1), (2), and (3) of this 
section separately under its own name.
    (d) A qualified HUBZone SBC which is a non-manufacturer may submit 
an offer on a contract for supplies if it meets the requirements under 
the non-manufacturer rule as defined in Sec. 121.406(b) of this title 
and if the small manufacturer is also a qualified HUBZone SBC.


<R05>
Sec. 126.602  Must a qualified HUBZone SBC maintain the employee residency percentage during contract performance?

    The qualified HUBZone SBC must attempt to maintain the required 
percentage of employees who reside in a HUBZone during the performance 
of any contract awarded to the concern on the basis of HUBZone status. 
``Attempt to maintain'' means making substantive and documented efforts 
to maintain that percentage such as written offers of employment, 
published advertisements seeking employees, and attendance at job fairs. 
HUBZone contracts are described more fully in Sec. 126.600. Enforcement 
of this paragraph will be the responsibility of SBA, which will monitor 
the requirement in accordance with Secs. 126.400 through 126.405.

[[Page 313]]


<R05>
Sec. 126.603  Does HUBZone certification guarantee receipt of HUBZone contracts?

    No. Qualified HUBZone SBCs should market their capabilities to 
appropriate procuring agencies in order to increase their prospects of 
having a requirement set aside for HUBZone contract award.


<R05>
Sec. 126.604  Who decides if a contract opportunity for HUBZone set-aside competition exists?

    The contracting officer for the contracting activity makes this 
decision.


<R05>
Sec. 126.605  What requirements are not available for HUBZone contracts?

    A contracting activity may not make a requirement available for a 
HUBZone contract if:
    (a) The contracting activity otherwise would fulfill that 
requirement through award to Federal Prison Industries, Inc. under 18 
U.S.C. 4124 or 4125, or to Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act participating non-
profit agencies for the blind and severely disabled, under 41 U.S.C. 46 
et seq., as amended; or
    (b) An 8(a) participant currently is performing that requirement or 
SBA has accepted that requirement for performance under the authority of 
the section 8(a) program, unless SBA has consented to release of the 
requirement from the section 8(a) program; or
    (c) The requirement is at or below the micropurchase threshold.


<R05>
Sec. 126.606  May a contracting officer request that SBA release an 8(a) requirement for award as a HUBZone contract?

    Yes. However, SBA will grant its consent only where neither the 
incumbent nor any other 8(a) participant(s) can perform the requirement, 
and where the section 8(a) program will not be adversely affected. The 
SBA official authorized to grant such consent is the AA/8(a)BD.


<R05>
Sec. 126.607  When must a contracting officer set aside a requirement for qualified HUBZone SBCs?

    (a) The contracting officer first must review a requirement to 
determine whether it is excluded from HUBZone contracting pursuant to 
Sec. 126.605.
    (b) The contracting officer must identify qualified HUBZone 8(a) 
concerns and other 8(a) concerns. The contracting officer must give 
first priority to qualified HUBZone 8(a) concerns.
    (c) After determining that neither paragraph (a) or (b) of this 
section apply, the contracting officer must set aside the requirement 
for competition restricted to qualified HUBZone SBCs if the contracting 
officer:
    (1) Has a reasonable expectation, after reviewing SBA's list of 
qualified HUBZone SBCs that at least two responsible qualified HUBZone 
SBCs will submit offers; and
    (2) Determines that award can be made at fair market price.


<R05>
Sec. 126.608  Are there HUBZone contracting opportunities below the simplified acquisition threshold?

    Yes. If the requirement is below the simplified acquisition 
threshold, the contracting officer should set-aside the requirement for 
consideration among qualified HUBZone SBCs using simplified acquisition 
procedures.


<R05>
Sec. 126.609  What must the contracting officer do if a contracting opportunity does not exist for competition among qualified HUBZone SBCs?

    If a contract opportunity for competition among qualified SBCs does 
not exist under the provisions of Sec. 126.607, the contracting officer 
must first consider the possibility of making an award to a qualified 
HUBZone SBC on a sole source basis, and then to a small business under 
small business set-aside procedures, in that order of precedence. If the 
criteria are not met for any of these special contracting authorities, 
then the contracting officer may solicit the procurement through another 
appropriate contracting method.


<R05>
Sec. 126.610  May SBA appeal a contracting officer's decision not to reserve a procurement for award as a HUBZone contract?

    The Administrator may appeal a contracting officer's decision not to 
make a particular requirement available for award as a HUBZone sole 
source or a HUBZone set-aside contract.

[[Page 314]]


<R05>
Sec. 126.611  What is the process for such an appeal?

    (a) Notice of appeal. When the contracting officer rejects a 
recommendation by SBA's Procurement Center Representative to make a 
requirement available for award as a HUBZone contract, he or she must 
notify the Procurement Center Representative as soon as practicable. If 
the Administrator intends to appeal the decision, SBA must notify the 
contracting officer no later than five business days after receiving 
notice of the contracting officer's decision.
    (b) Suspension of action. Upon receipt of notice of SBA's intent to 
appeal, the contracting officer must suspend further action regarding 
the procurement until the head of the contracting activity issues a 
written decision on the appeal, unless the head of the contracting 
activity makes a written determination that urgent and compelling 
circumstances which significantly affect the interests of the United 
States compel award of the contract.
    (c) Deadline for appeal. Within 15 business days of SBA's 
notification to the contracting officer, SBA must file its formal appeal 
with the head of the contracting activity or that agency may consider 
the appeal withdrawn.
    (d) Decision. The contracting activity must specify in writing the 
reasons for a denial of an appeal brought under this section.


<R05>
Sec. 126.612  When may a contracting officer award sole source contracts to a qualified HUBZone SBC?

    A contracting officer may award a sole source contract to a 
qualified HUBZone SBC only when the contracting officer determines that:
    (a) None of the provisions of Secs. 126.605 or 126.607 apply;
    (b) The anticipated award price of the contract, including options, 
will not exceed:
    (1) $5,000,000 for a requirement within the SIC codes for 
manufacturing; or
    (2) $3,000,000 for a requirement within all other SIC codes;
    (c) Two or more qualified HUBZone SBCs are not likely to submit 
offers;
    (d) A qualified HUBZone SBC is a responsible contractor able to 
perform the contract; and
    (e) Contract award can be made at a fair and reasonable price.


<R05>
Sec. 126.613  How does a price evaluation preference affect the bid of a qualified HUBZone SBC in full and open competition?

    Where a contracting officer will award a contract on the basis of 
full and open competition, the contracting officer must deem the price 
offered by a qualified HUBZone SBC to be lower than the price offered by 
another offeror (other than another small business concern) if the price 
offered by the qualified HUBZone SBC is not more than 10 percent higher 
than the price offered by the otherwise lowest, responsive, and 
responsible offeror.

    Example: In a full and open competition, a qualified HUBZone SBC 
submits an offer of $98; another small business concern submits an offer 
of $100; and a large business submits an offer of $93. The lowest, 
responsive, responsible offeror would be the large business. However, 
the contracting officer must apply the HUBZone price evaluation 
preference. If the qualified HUBZone SBC's offer is not more than 10 
percent higher than the large business's offer, the contracting officer 
must deem the qualified HUBZone SBC's price as lower than the price of 
the large business. In this example, the qualified HUBZone SBC's price 
is not more than 10 percent higher than the large business's price and, 
consequently, the qualified HUBZone SBC displaces the large business as 
the lowest, responsive, and responsible offeror. If the HUBZone SBC 
offer were $101, the award would go to the large business at $93. If the 
HUBZone SBC will not benefit from the preference, the preference is not 
applied to change an offer.


<R05>
Sec. 126.614  How does a contracting officer treat a concern that is both a qualified HUBZone SBC and an SDB in a full and open competition?

    A concern that is both a qualified HUBZone SBC and an SDB must 
receive the benefit of both the HUBZone price evaluation preference 
described in Sec. 126.614 and the SDB price evaluation preference 
described in 10 U.S.C. 2323 and the Federal Acquisition Streamlining 
Act, section 7102(a)(1)(B), Public Law 103-355, in a full and open 
competition.


<R05>
Sec. 126.615  May a large business participate on a HUBZone contract?

    A large business may not participate as a prime contractor on a 
HUBZone

[[Page 315]]

award but may participate as a subcontractor to an otherwise qualified 
HUBZone SBC, subject to the contract performance requirements set forth 
in Sec. 126.700.


<R05>
Sec. 126.616  What requirements must a joint venture satisfy to bid on a HUBZone contract?

    A joint venture may bid on a HUBZone contract if the joint venture 
meets all of the following requirements:
    (a) HUBZone joint venture. A qualified HUBZone SBC may enter into a 
joint venture with one or more other qualified HUBZone SBCs, 8(a) 
participants, or WOBs for the purpose of performing a specific HUBZone 
contract.
    (b) Size of concerns. A joint venture of at least one qualified 
HUBZone SBC and an 8(a) participant or a woman-owned small business 
concern may submit an offer for a HUBZone contract so long as each 
concern is small under the size standard corresponding to the SIC code 
assigned to the contract, provided:
    (1) For a procurement having a revenue-based size standard, the 
procurement exceeds half the size standard corresponding to the SIC code 
assigned to the contract; and
    (2) For a procurement having an employee-based size standard, the 
procurement exceeds $10 million.
    (c) Performance of work. The aggregate of the qualified HUBZone SBCs 
to the joint venture, not each concern separately, must perform the 
applicable percentage of work required by Sec. 126.700.


<R04>
              Subpart G--Contract Performance Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 126.700  What are the subcontracting percentages requirements under this program?

    (a) Subcontracting percentage requirements. A qualified HUBZone SBC 
prime contractor can subcontract part of a HUBZone contract provided:
    (1) In the case of a contract for services (except construction), 
the qualified HUBZone SBC spends at least 50 percent of the cost of the 
contract performance incurred for personnel on the concern's employees 
or on the employees of other qualified HUBZone SBCs;
    (2) In the case of a contract for general construction, the 
qualified HUBZone SBC spends at least 15 percent of the cost of contract 
performance incurred for personnel on the concern's employees or the 
employees of other qualified HUBZone SBCs;
    (3) In the case of a contract for construction by special trade 
contractors, the qualified HUBZone SBC spends at least 25 percent of the 
cost of contract performance incurred for personnel on the concerns' 
employees or the employees of other qualified HUBZone SBCs; and
    (4) In the case of a contract for procurement of supplies (other 
than a procurement from a regular dealer in such supplies) the qualified 
HUBZone SBC spends at least 50 percent of the manufacturing cost 
(excluding the cost of materials) on performing the contract in a 
HUBZone. One or more qualified HUBZone SBCs may combine to meet this 
subcontracting percentage requirement.
    (b) Definitions. Many definitions applicable to this section can be 
found in Sec. 125.6 of this title.


<R05>
Sec. 126.701   Can these subcontracting percentages requirements change?

    Yes. The Administrator may change the subcontracting percentage 
requirements if the Administrator determines that such action is 
necessary to reflect conventional industry practices.


<R05>
Sec. 126.702  How can the subcontracting percentage requirements be changed?

    Representatives of a national trade or industry group (as defined by 
two-digit Major Group industry codes) may request a change in 
subcontracting percentage requirements for that industry. Changes in 
subcontracting percentage requirements may be requested only for 
categories defined by two-digit Major Group industry codes in the 
Standard Industry Classification (SIC) Code system. SBA will not 
consider requests from anyone other than a representative of a national 
trade or industry group or requests for changes for four-digit SIC Code 
categories.

[[Page 316]]


<R05>
Sec. 126.703  What are the procedures for requesting changes in subcontracting percentages?

    (a) Format of request. There is no prescribed format, but the 
requester should try to demonstrate to the Administrator that a change 
in percentage is necessary to reflect conventional industry practices, 
and should support its request with information including, but not 
limited to:
    (1) Information relative to the economic conditions and structure of 
the entire national industry;
    (2) Market data, technical changes in the industry and industry 
trends;
    (3) Specific reasons and justifications for the change in the 
subcontracting percentage;
    (4) The effect such a change would have on the federal procurement 
process; and
    (5) Information demonstrating how the proposed change would promote 
the purposes of the HUBZone Program.
    (b) Notice to public. Upon an adequate preliminary showing to SBA, 
SBA will publish in the Federal Register a notice of its receipt of a 
request that it consider a change in the subcontracting percentage 
requirements for a particular industry for HUBZone contracts. The notice 
will identify the group making the request, and give the public an 
opportunity to submit to the Administrator information and arguments in 
both support and opposition.
    (c) Comments. Once SBA has published a notice in the Federal 
Register, it will afford a period of not less than 60 days for public 
comment.
    (d) Decision. SBA will render its decision after the close of the 
comment period. If it decides against a change, it will publish notice 
of its decision in the Federal Register. Concurrent with the notice, SBA 
will advise the requester of its decision in writing. If it decides in 
favor of a change, SBA will propose an appropriate change to this part 
in accordance with proper rulemaking procedures.


<R04>
                           Subpart H--Protests


<R05>
Sec. 126.800  Who may protest the status of a qualified HUBZone SBC?

    (a) For sole source procurements. SBA or the contracting officer may 
protest the proposed awardee's qualified HUBZone SBC status.
    (b) For all other procurements. Any interested party may protest the 
apparent successful offeror's qualified HUBZone SBC status.


<R05>
Sec. 126.801  How does one file a HUBZone status protest?

    (a) General. The protest procedures described in this part are 
separate from those governing size protests and appeals. All protests 
relating to whether a qualified HUBZone SBC is a ``small'' business for 
purposes of any Federal program are subject to part 121 of this title 
and must be filed in accordance with that part. If a protester protests 
both the size of the HUBZone SBC and whether the concern meets the 
HUBZone qualifying requirements set forth in Sec. 126.200, SBA will 
process each protest concurrently, under the procedures set forth in 
part 121 of this title and this part.
    (b) Format. Protests must be in writing and state all specific 
grounds for the protest. A protest merely asserting that the protested 
concern is not a qualified HUBZone SBC, without setting forth specific 
facts or allegations, is insufficient.
    (c) Filing. (1) An interested party other than a contracting officer 
or SBA must submit its written protest to the contracting officer.
    (2) A contracting officer and SBA must submit their protest to the 
AA/HUB.
    (3) Protestors may deliver their protests in person, by facsimile, 
by express delivery service, or by U.S. mail (postmarked within the 
applicable time period).
    (d) Timeliness. (1) An interested party must submit its protest by 
close of business on the fifth business day after bid opening (in sealed 
bid acquisitions) or by close of business on the fifth business day 
after notification by the contracting officer of the apparent successful 
offeror (in negotiated acquisitions).
    (2) Any protest received after the time limits is untimely.
    (3) Any protest received prior to bid opening or notification of 
intended award, whichever applies, is premature.

[[Page 317]]

    (e) Referral to SBA. The contracting officer must forward to SBA any 
non-premature protest received, notwithstanding whether he or she 
believes it is sufficiently specific or timely. The contracting officer 
must send protests to AA/HUB, U.S. Small Business Administration, 409 
3rd Street, SW, Washington, DC 20416.


<R05>
Sec. 126.802  Who decides a HUBZone status protest?

    The AA/HUB or designee will determine whether the concern has 
qualified HUBZone status.


<R05>
Sec. 126.803  How will SBA process a HUBZone status protest?

    (a) Notice of receipt of protest. (1) SBA immediately will notify

information responsive to the protest within 5 business days.
    (b) Time period for determination. (1) SBA will determine the 
HUBZone status of the protested HUBZone SBC within 15 business days 
after receipt of a protest.

decision.


<R05>
Sec. 126.804  Will SBA decide all HUBZone status protests?

contracting officer may file appeals of protest determinations with 
SBA's ADA/GC&8(a)BD.
    (b) Timeliness of appeal. SBA's ADA/GC&8(a)BD must receive the 
appeal no later than 5 business days after the date of receipt of the 
protest determination. SBA will dismiss any appeal received after the 
five-day period.
    (c) Method of Submission. The party appealing the decision may 
deliver its appeal in person, by facsimile, by express delivery service, 
or by U.S. mail (postmarked within the applicable time period).
    (d) Notice of appeal. The party bringing an appeal must provide 
notice of the appeal to the contracting activity contracting officer and 
either the protested HUBZone SBC or original protestor, as appropriate.
    (e) Grounds for appeal. (1) SBA will re-examine a protest 
determination only if there was a clear and significant error in the 
processing of the protest or if the AA/HUB failed completely to consider 
a significant fact contained within the information supplied by the 
protestor or the protested HUBZone SBC.
    (2) SBA will not consider additional information or changed 
circumstances that were not disclosed at the time of the AA/HUB's 
decision or that are based on disagreement with the findings and 
conclusions contained in the determination.
    (f) Contents of appeal. The appeal must be in writing. The appeal 
must identify the protest determination being appealed and set forth a 
full and specific statement as to why the decision is erroneous or what 
significant fact the AA/HUB failed to consider.

[[Page 318]]

    (g) Completion of appeal after award. An appeal may proceed to 
completion even after award of the contract that prompted the protest, 
if so desired by the protested HUBZone SBC, or where SBA determines that 
a decision on appeal is meaningful.
    (h) Decision. The ADA/GC&8(a)BD will make its decision within 5 
business days of its receipt, if practicable, and will base its decision 
only on the information and documentation in the protest record as 
supplemented by the appeal. SBA will provide a copy of the decision to 
the contracting officer, the protestor, and the protested HUBZone SBC, 
consistent with law. The ADA/GC&8(a)BD's decision is the final agency 
decision.

section, such Overmatched Amount is reclassified as committed Matching 
Funds.
    (4) Allowable Overmatched Amounts which have not been used in the 
manner described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section may, with the 
approval of the AA/SBDCs, be used as a credit to offset any confirmed 
audit disallowances applicable only to the budget period in which the 
Overmatched Amount exists and the two previous budget periods. Such

requirement, the lesser of the following may be allocated as indirect 
costs of the Program and charged against the Federal contribution:
    (1) Twenty percent (20%) of Federal contribution, or
    (2) The amount remaining after the waived portion of indirect costs 
is subtracted from the total indirect costs.
    (c) Separate SBDC service provider budgets.
    (1) The applicant organization shall include separate budgets for 
all subcontracted SBDC service providers in conformity with OMB 
requirements. Applicable direct cost categories and indirect cost base/
rate agreements shall be included for the Lead Center and all SBDC 
service providers, using a rate equal to or less than the negotiated 
predetermined rate. If no such rate exists, the sponsoring SBDC 
organization or SBDC service provider shall negotiate a rate with its 
Cognizant Agency. In the event the sponsoring SBDC organization or SBDC 
service provider does not have a Cognizant Agency, the rate shall be 
negotiated with the SBA Project Officer in accordance with OMB 
guidelines (see OMB Circular A-21).
    (2) The amount of cash, in-kind contributions and indirect costs for 
the Lead Center and all sub-contracted SBDC service providers shall be 
indicated in accordance with OMB requirements.
    (d) Cost principles. Principles for determining allowable costs are 
contained in OMB Circulars A-21 (cost principles for grants, contracts,

principles for programs administered by State and local governments), 
and A-122 (cost principles for nonprofit organizations).
    (e) Costs associated with lobbying. No portion of the Federal 
contribution received by an SBDC may be used for lobbying activities, 
either directly by the SBDC or indirectly through outside organizations, 
except those activities permitted by OMB. Restrictions on and reports of 
lobbying activities by the SBDC shall be in accordance with OMB 
requirements, Section 319 of Public Law No. 101-121, and the annual 
Program Announcement.

    (f) Salaries. (1) If a recipient organization is an educational 
institution, the salaries of the SBDC Director and the subcenter 
Directors must approximate the average annualized salary of a full 
professor and an assistant professor, respectively, in the school or 
department in which the SBDC is located. If a recipient organization is 
not an educational institution, the salaries of the SBDC Director and 
the subcenter Directors must approximate the average salaries of 
parallel positions within the recipient organization. In both cases, the 
recipient organization should consider the Director's longevity in the 
Program, the number of subcenters and the individual's experience and 
background.
    (2) Salaries for all other positions within the SBDC should be based 
upon level of responsibility, and be comparable to salaries for similar 
positions in the area served by the SBDC.
    (3) Recruitment and salary increases for SBDC Directors, subcenter 
Directors and staff members should conform to the administrative policy 
of the recipient organization.
    (g) Travel. All travel must be separately identified in the proposed 
budget as planned in-State, planned out-of-State, unplanned in-State or 
unplanned out-of-State. All proposed travel must use coach class, apply 
directly to specific work of the SBDC or be incurred in the normal 
course of Program administration, and conform to the written travel 
policies of the recipient organization or the sponsoring SBDC 
organization. (Per diem rates, including lodging, shall not exceed those 
authorized by the recipient organization.) Transportation costs must be 
justified in writing, including the estimated cost, number of persons 
traveling, and the benefit to be derived by the small business community 
from the proposed travel. A specific projected amount, based on the 
SBDC's past experience, where appropriate, must also be included in the 
budget for unplanned travel. A more detailed justification must be given 
for unplanned out-of-State travel. Any proposed unplanned out-of-State 
travel exceeding the approved budgeted amount for travel must be 
submitted to the Project Officer for approval on a case-by-case basis. 
Travel outside the United States must have prior approval by the AA/
SBDCs on a case-by-case basis.
    (h) Dues. Costs of memberships in business, technical, and 
professional organizations shall be allowable expenses. The use of 
Federal funds to pay dues for business, technical and professional 
organizations shall be permitted, provided that the payments are 
included in the budget proposal, are approved by the SBA and comply with 
Sec. 130.460(e).


<R05>
Sec. 130.470  Fees.

    An SBDC may charge clients a reasonable fee to cover the costs of 
Training sponsored or cosponsored by the SBDC, costs of services 
provided by or obtained from third parties, or the costs of providing 
Specialized Services. Fees may not be imposed for Counseling.


<R05>
Sec. 130.480  Program income.

    (a) Program income for recipient organizations or SBDC service 
providers based in universities or nonprofit organizations shall be 
subject to OMB requirements (see OMB Circular A-110). Program income for 
recipient organizations or SBDC service providers based in State or 
local governments shall be subject to OMB requirements (see the 
provisions of Sec. 7.e and Attachment E of OMB Circular A-102) and 13 
CFR 143.25.
    (b) Program income, including any interest earned on Program income, 
must be used to expand the quantity or quality of services, resources or 
outreach provided by the SBDC network. It cannot be used to satisfy the 
requirements for Matching Funds. The Project Officer shall monitor the 
use of Program income. Any unused Program income will be carried over to 
a subsequent budget period.
    (c) SBDCs must report in detail on standard SBA forms receipts and 
expenditures of program income, including any income received through 
cosponsored activities. A narrative description of how Program income 
was used to accomplish Program objectives shall be included.


<R05>
Sec. 130.500  Funding.

    The SBA funds Cooperative Agreements through its internal Letter of

[[Page 326]]

Credit Replacement System (LORS), using SBA standard forms to establish 
and modify letters of credit. SBDCs must use SBA standard forms to draw 
down funds required to meet their estimated or actual expenses and to 
submit quarterly cash transactions reports used by SBA to monitor the 
frequency of drawdowns and the cash-on-hand balance. Repeated drawdowns 
in excess of immediate cash needs may result in the cancellation of the 
letter of credit. If interest results from the deposit of any drawdowns 
in an interest-bearing account, SBDCs, other than State government 
sponsored SBDCs, must report and return such interest annually to SBA.


<R05>
Sec. 130.600  Cooperative agreement. [Reserved]


<R05>

Administrative requirements are contained in 13 CFR 143 and applicable 
OMB Circulars.


<R05>

    (a) Requests for revisions. The recipient organization may request 
at any time one or more revisions to the Cooperative Agreement on an 
appropriate SBA form signed by the recipient organization's authorized 
representative (including a revised budget and budget narrative, if 
applicable). Revisions will normally relate to changes in scope, work or 
funding during the specified budget year.
    (b) Revisions which require amendment to Cooperative Agreement. The 
Cooperative Agreement shall list the revisions which require Project 
Officer concurrence, review by the Program Manager and the Grants 
Management Specialist, approval of the AA/SBDCs and amendment of the 
Cooperative Agreement. No application for an amendment shall be 
effective until it is approved and incorporated into the Cooperative 
Agreement. Revisions which require amendments shall include:

    (5) Any proposed sole-source or one-bid contracts exceeding the 
limits established by applicable regulations or OMB Circulars; and
    (6) The carryover from one budget period to the next budget period 
of unobligated, unexpended SBA funds allocable under the Cooperative 
Agreement to nonrecurring, nonseverable bona fide needs of the SBDC 
network as provided in applicable OMB Circulars and the annual Program 
Announcement.
    (c) Revisions which do not require amendments to the Cooperative 
Agreement. (1) Budget revisions. Any budget revision, except those which 
are covered by paragraph (b)(4) of this section. Budget revisions 
require approval of the SBA Project Officer and the AA/SBDCs as 
prescribed by applicable OMB Circulars or 13 CFR 143.30.
    (2) Reallocation of funds. Reallocation of funds must be conducted 
in accordance with applicable OMB Circulars or 13 CFR 143.30. Additional 
guidance on this matter may be included in the annual Program 
Announcement.


<R05>
Sec. 130.630  Dispute resolution procedures.

    (a) Financial Disputes. (1) A recipient organization wishing to 
resolve a financial Dispute formally must submit a written statement 
describing the subject of the Dispute, together with any relevant 
documents or other evidence bearing on the Dispute, to the Grants 
Management Specialist, with copies to the Project Officer. The Grants 
Management Specialist shall respond in writing to the recipient 
organization within 30 calendar days of receipt of the descriptive 
statement.

[[Page 327]]

    (2) If the recipient organization receives an unfavorable decision 
from the Grants Management Specialist, it may file an appeal with the 
AA/SBDCs within 30 calendar days of issuance of the unfavorable 
decision. The AA/SBDCs shall respond in writing to the recipient 
organization within 15 calendar days of receipt of the appeal.
    (3) If the recipient organization receives an unfavorable decision 
from the AA/SBDCs, it may make a final appeal to the SBA Grants and 
Cooperative Agreements Appeals Committee (the ``Committee'') within 30 
calendar days of the date of issuance of the AA/SBDCs' written decision. 
Copies of the appeal shall also be sent to the Grants Management 
Specialist and the Project Officer.
    (4) Appeals must be in writing. Formal briefs and other technical 
forms of pleading are not required. Requests for a hearing will not be 
granted unless there are material facts substantially in dispute. 
Appeals must contain at least the following:
    (i) Name and address of the recipient organization;
    (ii) The SBA field office;
    (iii) The Cooperative Agreement;
    (iv) A statement of the grounds for appeal, with reasons why the 
appeal should be sustained;

    (vi) If a hearing is requested, a statement of the material facts 
which are substantially in dispute.
    (5) The AA/SBDCs or the Committee may request from the SBDC or the 
District Office additional information or documentation at any stage in 
the proceedings.
    (6) If a request for a hearing is granted, the Committee will 
provide the recipient organization with written instructions, and will 
afford the parties an opportunity to present their positions to the 
Committee.
    (7) The Committee will reach a decision on the merits of the appeal 
within 30 days of the hearing date.
    (8) The Chairperson, with advice from the Office of General Counsel, 
shall prepare and transmit a written final decision to the recipient

Project Officer.
    (9) Expedited Dispute appeal process. By an affirmative vote 
constituting a majority of its total membership, the Committee may 
shorten response times to attain final resolution of a Dispute before 
the issuance date of a new Cooperative Agreement. At any time within 120 
days of the end of the budget period, the recipient organization may 
submit a written request to use an expedited process. If a Dispute 
affects refunding, the Committee must meet to consider the matter prior 
to the end of the budget period, provided that the recipient 
organization has supplied the Committee with all requested 
documentation.
    (b) Programmatic (non-financial) Disputes. (1) If a programmatic 
Dispute is not resolved at the SBA District Office level, the recipient 
organization may request its submission to the next SBA administrative 
level having authority to review such matter. The Project Officer shall 
refer the Dispute in writing, including comments of the SBDC Director, 
within 15 calendar days of receipt of the request.
    (2) If the programmatic Dispute is not resolved at an intermediate 
SBA administrative level within 15 calendar days of receipt thereof, it

All comments of the SBDC Director must be included in any package 
forwarded to the AA/SBDCs.
    (3) The AA/SBDCs shall transmit a final, written decision to the 
recipient organization, the SBDC Director, the SBA Project Officer and 
other appropriate SBA field office personnel within 30 calendar days of 
receipt of such documentation, unless an extension of time is mutually 
agreed upon by the recipient organization and the AA/SBDCs.


<R05>
Sec. 130.700  Suspension, termination and non-renewal.

    (a) General. After SBA has entered into a Cooperative Agreement with 
a recipient organization, it shall not suspend, terminate or fail to 
renew the agreement unless SBA gives the recipient organization written 
notice setting forth the reasons and affording the recipient 
organization an opportunity for a hearing. Subject to this requirement

[[Page 328]]

and the provisions of Sec. 130.700(c) regarding non-renewal procedures 
for non-performance, the applicable general procedures for suspension 
and termination are contained in 13 CFR 143.43 and 143.44, and in OMB 
Circular A-110, Attachment L.
    (b) Causes. Causes which may lead to suspension, termination, or 
failure to renew include non-performance, poor performance, 
unwillingness to implement changes to improve performance, or any of the 
following reasons:
    (1) Disregard or material violation of these regulations;
    (2) A willful or material failure to perform under the Cooperative 
Agreement or under these regulations;
    (3) Conduct reflecting a lack of business integrity or honesty;
    (4) A conflict of interest causing real or perceived detriment to a 
small business concern, a contractor, the SBDC or SBA;
    (5) Improper use of Federal funds;
    (6) Failure of a Lead Center or its subcenters to consent to audits 
or examination or to maintain required documents or records;
    (7) Failure of the SBDC Director to work at the SBDC Lead Center on 
a full-time basis;
    (8) Failure promptly to suspend or terminate the employment of an 
SBDC Director, subcenter Director or other key employee upon receipt of 
knowledge by the recipient organization and/or SBA that such individual 
is engaging in or has engaged in conduct resulting in a criminal 
conviction or civil judgment which would cause the public to question 
the SBDC's business integrity, taking into consideration such factors as 
the magnitude, repetitiveness, harm caused and remoteness in time of the 
activity or activities underlying the conviction or judgment.
    (9) Violation of the SBDC's standards of conduct as specified in 
these rules and as established by the SBDC pursuant to these rules; or
    (10) Any other cause not otherwise specified which materially and 
adversely affects the operation or integrity of an SBDC or the SBDC 
program.
    (c) Non-Renewal Procedure. (1) Subject to Sec. 130.700(a), when an 
SBA District Director believes there is sufficient evidence of SBDC 
nonperformance, poor performance or unwillingness to implement changes 
to improve performance, under the terms of the Cooperative Agreement or 
these regulations, the District Director shall notify the SBDC Director 
and any other appropriate official of the recipient organization of an 
intention not to approve its renewal application.
    (2) Notice can be submitted at any time during the budget period, 
but normally should be sent no later than 3 months prior to the due date 
for renewal applications at the District Office.
    (3) The notice shall specifically cite the reasons for the intention 
not to renew. It must allow the recipient organization 60 days within 
which to change its operations to correct the problems cited in the 
notice, and to report to the Project Officer, in writing, regarding the 
results of such changes.
    (4) If the recipient organization is unwilling or unable to address 
the specific problem areas to the satisfaction of the SBA District 
Office within the 60-day period, the SBA Project Officer shall have ten 
(10) calendar days after expiration of the 60 days to submit to the AA/
SBDCs a written description of the unresolved issues, a summary of the 
positions of the District Office on the issues, and any supportive 
documentation.
    (5) The AA/SBDCs shall transmit a written, final decision to the 
recipient organization, the SBDC Director, the SBA Project Officer and 
other appropriate SBA field office personnel within 30 calendar days of 
receipt of such documentation, unless an extension of time is mutually 
agreed upon by the recipient organization and the AA/SBDCs.
    (6) The AA/SBDCs shall consider written documentation of the issues 
to be resolved, including all relevant correspondence between the 
Project Officer, District Director and any other SBA personnel and the 
affected recipient organization. At a minimum, such documentation shall 
commence with the first written notice of issues invoking the non-
renewal procedure. In addition, the AA/SBDCs also may communicate with 
the recipient organization and appropriate SBA personnel.

[[Page 329]]

    (7) If the AA/SBDCs determines that the evidence submitted 
establishes nonperformance, ineffective performance or an unwillingness 
to implement suggested changes to improve performance, the AA/SBDCs 
shall have full discretion to order non-renewal of the SBDC. The SBA 
District Office shall then pursue proposals from other organizations 
interested in applying for SBDC designation. The incumbent SBDC shall 
have until the end of the budget period or 120 days, whichever is 
longer, to conclude operations and to submit close-out documents to the 
SBA District Office. Close-out procedures shall conform with applicable 
OMB Circulars.
    (d) Effect of action on subcenter. If competing applications are 
being accepted, a subcenter of the previously funded recipient 
organization may apply for designation as the recipient organization, so 
long as the subcenter was not involved in the conduct leading to non-
renewal or termination of the former recipient organization.


<R05>
Sec. 130.800  Oversight of the SBDC program.

    SBA shall monitor and oversee the Cooperative Agreement and ongoing

programmatic and financial examination of each SBDC.
    (c) Certification program. SBA may provide financial support to the 
Recognized Organization to develop and implement an SBDC certification

for audits required of Federal grantees under the Single Audit Act of 
1984 or applicable OMB guidelines (see Circulars A-110, A-128 and A-
133), nor shall such internal review substitute for audits to be 
conducted by the SBA Office of Inspector General under authority of the 
Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended (see Sec. 130.830(b)).


<R05>
Sec. 130.820  Reports and recordkeeping.

    (a) Records. The recipient organization shall maintain the records 
required for a Lead Center audit and SBA reports. Lead Centers and other

    (b) Audits. (1) Pre-award audit. Applicant organizations that 
propose to enter the Program for the first time may be subject to a pre-

the accounting system, the suitability of posed costs and the nature and 
source of proposed Matching Funds.
    (2) Interim or final audits. The recipient organization or SBA may 
conduct SBDC network audits. All audits will be conducted according to 
Government Auditing Standards, promulgated by the Comptroller General of

with Government Auditing Standards and all applicable OMB Circulars.
    (c) Investigations. SBA may conduct investigations as it deems 
necessary to determine whether any person or entity has engaged in acts 
or practices constituting a violation of the Act, any rule, regulation 
or order issued under that Act, or any other applicable Federal law.

Sec. 134.204  Service and filing requirements.

    (a) Service. Each party is responsible for the service of its 
pleadings and other submissions upon all other parties or their 
attorneys. Unless otherwise ordered by the Judge, service is made by 
providing each party, or its attorney, with a copy of the pleading or 
other submission by personal delivery, first- class mail, express mail, 
facsimile transmission, or commercial delivery service. Service by mail 
must be directed as follows:
    (1) To a party's last-known residence or business address if it has 
not yet appeared in the case, or to the address of a party which has 
appeared as shown in its submission;
    (2) If a party has appeared in the case through an attorney, to the 
address of the attorney shown in the party's submission or in a notice 
of appearance;
    (3) If SBA is the party, unless an attorney has been specified in 
SBA's submissions to OHA, by mailing to: Office of General Counsel, 
Small Business Administration, 409 Third Street, SW., Washington, DC 
20416.
    (b) Filing. (1) All pleadings and other submissions must be filed 
with OHA by personal delivery, first-class mail, express mail, facsimile 
transmission, or commercial delivery service. Filing may only be 
accomplished at the following address: Office of Hearings and Appeals,

    (2) If filing is by personal delivery or commercial delivery 
service, such filing must be accomplished between the hours of 8:30 a.m. 
and 5:00 p.m. If filing is by facsimile transmission, the telephone 
number to be used may be obtained by calling OHA.
    (c) Copies. Only the original of a pleading or other submission must 
be filed with OHA. In the case of a document offered as evidence, an 
authenticated copy may be filed instead of the original.
    (d) Certificate of service. A signed certificate stating how and 
when service was made on all parties must be attached to each pleading 
or other submission filed with OHA.
    (e) Date. Unless otherwise specified by the Judge, the date of 
service or filing is as follows:
    (1) If by facsimile transmission, the date of transmission.
    (2) If by first-class mail, the date of postmark. Where the postmark 
is illegible or incomplete, there is a rebuttable presumption that the 
postmark was dated five days prior to the date of receipt.
    (3) If by personal delivery, express mail, or commercial delivery 
service, the date of receipt.
    (f) Confidential information. Any information in pleadings or other 
submissions that is believed by the submitting party to constitute 
proprietary or confidential information need not be served upon parties 
so long as the deletions are clearly identified and generally described

that the withheld information be provided to other parties, subject to 
any appropriate protective order.


<R05>
Sec. 134.205  Motion for a more definite statement.

statement stays the time for serving and filing an

[[Page 334]]

answer. The Judge will establish the time for serving and filing an

Sec. 134.206  The answer.

    (a) A respondent must serve and file an answer within 45 days after 
the service of a petition or order to show cause, except that debt 
collection proceeding answers are due within 30 days.
    (b) The answer must contain the following:
    (1) An admission or denial of each of the factual allegations 
contained in the petition or order to show cause, or a statement that 
the respondent denies knowledge or information sufficient to determine

    (2) Any affirmative defenses; and
    (3) The name, address, telephone number, and signature of the 
respondent or its attorney.

program, SBA must serve and file the administrative record pertaining to 
that determination within the same time period applicable to the service 
and filing of its answer. If SBA fails to do so, the Judge will issue an 
order directing SBA to serve and file the administrative record by a 
specified date.
    (e) If the respondent fails to serve and file an answer within the 
time period set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, or within any 
extended time period granted by the Judge, that failure will constitute 
a default. Following such a default, the respondent may be prohibited 
from participating further in the case, except to serve and file the 
administrative record in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 134.207  Amendments and supplemental pleadings.

    (a) Amendments. Upon motion, and under terms needed to avoid 
prejudice to any non-moving party, the Judge may permit the service and 
filing of amendments to pleadings. However, an amendment will not be 
permitted if it would cause unreasonable delay in the determination of 
the matter.
    (b) Supplements. Upon motion, and under terms needed to avoid 
prejudice to any non-moving party, the Judge may permit the service and 
filing of a supplemental pleading setting forth relevant transactions or 
occurrences that have taken place since the filing of the original 
pleading.
    (c) 8(a) appeals. In 8(a) program appeals, amendments to pleadings 
and supplemental pleadings will be permitted by the Judge only upon a 
showing of good cause.

its knowledge, and that the submission is not being filed for the 
purpose of delay or harassment.

file a motion to compel discovery. Discovery may be opposed on the 
grounds of harassment, needless embarrassment, irrelevance, undue burden 
or expense, privilege, or confidentiality.

<R05>
Sec. 134.214  Subpoenas.

    (a) Availability. At the request of a party, or upon his or her own 
initiative, a Judge may issue a subpoena requiring a witness to appear 
and testify, or to produce particular documents, at a specified time and 
place.
    (b) Requests. A request for the issuance of a subpoena must be

<R05>
Sec. 134.215  Interlocutory appeals.

    (a) General. A motion for leave to take an interlocutory appeal from 
a Judge's ruling will not be entertained in those proceedings in which 
OHA issues final decisions. In all other cases, an interlocutory appeal 
will be permitted only if, upon motion by a party, or upon the Judge's 
own initiative, the Judge certifies that his or her ruling raises a 
question which is immediately appealable. Interlocutory appeals will be 
decided by the AA/OHA or a designee.
    (b) Motion for certification. A party must serve and file a motion 
for certification no later than 20 days after issuance of the ruling to 
which the motion applies. A denial of the motion does not preclude 
objections to the ruling in any subsequent request for review of an 
initial decision.
    (c) Basis for certification. The Judge will certify a ruling for 
interlocutory appeal only if he or she determines that:
    (1) The ruling involves an important question of law or policy about 
which there is substantial ground for a difference of opinion; and
    (2) An interlocutory appeal will materially expedite resolution of 
the case, or denial of an interlocutory appeal would cause undue 
hardship to a party.
    (d) Stay of proceedings. A stay while an interlocutory appeal is 
pending will be at the discretion of the Judge.


<R05>
Sec. 134.216  Alternative dispute resolution procedures.

    At any time during the pendency of a case, the parties may submit a 
joint motion requesting that the Judge permit the use of alternative 
dispute resolution procedures to assist in resolving the matter. If the 
motion is granted, the Judge will also stay the proceedings before OHA, 
in whole or in part, as he or she deems appropriate, pending the outcome 
of the alternative dispute resolution procedures.


<R05>
Sec. 134.217  Settlement.

Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 551 et seq., to an Administrative 
Law Judge. The AA/OHA will assign all other cases before OHA to either 
an Administrative Law Judge or an Administrative Judge, or, if the AA/
OHA is a duly licensed attorney, to himself or herself.
    (b) Authority. Except as otherwise limited by this part, or by 
statute or other regulation, a Judge has the authority to take all 
appropriate action to ensure the efficient, prompt, and fair 
determination of a case, including, but not limited to, the authority to 
administer oaths and affirmations and to subpoena and examine witnesses.
    (c) Recusal. Upon the motion of a party, or upon the Judge's own 
initiative, a Judge will promptly recuse himself or herself from further 
participation in a case whenever disqualification is appropriate due to 
conflict of interest, bias, or some other significant reason. A denial 
of a motion for recusal may be immediately appealed to the AA/OHA, or to 
the Administrative Law Judge if the AA/OHA is the Judge, but that appeal 
will not stay proceedings in the case.


<R05>
Sec. 134.219  Sanctions.

    A Judge may impose appropriate sanctions, except for fees, costs, or 
monetary penalties, which he or she deems necessary to serve the ends of 
justice, if a party or its attorney:

    (b) Fails to comply with the rules set forth in this part;
    (c) Acts in bad faith or for purposes of delay or harassment;

prohibited consultation or communication, the Judge will disclose the

sanctions as he or she deems appropriate.

    Prior to a hearing, the Judge, at his or her own initiative, or upon

may assist in the efficient, prompt, and fair determination of the case.

    (b) Place and time. The place and time of oral hearings is within 
the discretion of the Judge, who shall give due regard to the necessity 
and convenience of the parties, their attorneys, and witnesses. The 
Judge may direct that an oral hearing be conducted by telephone.
    (c) Public access. Unless otherwise ordered by the Judge, all oral 
hearings are public.
    (d) Payment of subpoenaed witnesses. A party which obtains a 
witness' presence at an oral hearing by subpoena, must pay to that 
witness the fees and mileage costs to which the witness would be 
entitled in Federal Court.
    (e) Recording. Oral hearings will be recorded verbatim. A transcript 
of a recording may be purchased by a party, at its own expense, from the 
recording service.

     Subpart D--Rules of Practice for Appeals Under the 8(a) Program

    Source: 63 FR 35766, June 30, 1998, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 134.401  Scope of the rules in this subpart D.

    The rules of practice in this subpart D apply to all appeals to OHA

    (a) Denials of 8(a) BD program admission based solely on a negative 
finding(s) of social disadvantage, economic disadvantage, ownership or

<R05>
Sec. 134.402  Appeal petition.

    In addition to the requirements of Sec. 134.203, an appeal petition 
must state, with specific reference to the determination and the record 
supporting such determination, the reasons why the determination is 
alleged to be arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.


<R05>
Sec. 134.403  Service of appeal petition.

    (a) Concurrent with its filing with OHA, a concern must also serve 
SBA's AA/8(a)BD and the appropriate Associate General Counsel in SBA's 
Office of General Counsel with a copy of the petition, including 
attachments.
    (1) For appeals relating to denials of program admission pursuant to 
Sec. 124.206 of this title, suspensions of program assistance pursuant 
to Sec. 124.305, or denials of requests for waivers pursuant to 
Sec. 124.515, a petitioner must serve the SBA's Associate General

    (2) For appeals relating to early graduation pursuant to 
Secs. 124.302 and 124.304 or termination pursuant to Secs. 124.303 and 
124.304, a petitioner must serve the SBA's Associate General Counsel for 
Litigation.
    (3) Service on SBA's Office of General Counsel generally or the SBA 
General Counsel do not meet the service requirements of this section.
    (b) Service should be addressed to the AA/8(a)BD and the applicable 
Associate General Counsel at the Small Business Administration, 409 3rd 
Street, SW, Washington, DC 20416.


<R05>
Sec. 134.404  Decision by Administrative Law Judge.

    Appeal proceedings brought under this subpart will be conducted by 
an Administrative Law Judge.


<R05>
Sec. 134.405  Jurisdiction.

    (a) The Administrative Law Judge selected to preside over an appeal 
shall decline to accept jurisdiction over any matter if:
    (1) The appeal does not, on its face, allege facts that, if proven 
to be true, would warrant reversal or modification of the determination, 
including appeals of denials of 8(a) BD program admission based in whole 
or in part on grounds other than a negative finding of social 
disadvantage, economic disadvantage, ownership or control;
    (2) The appeal is untimely filed under Sec. 134.202 or is not 
otherwise filed in accordance with the requirements of this subpart or 
the requirements in subparts A and B of this part; or
    (3) The matter has been decided or is the subject of an adjudication 
before a court of competent jurisdiction over such matters.
    (b) Once the Administrative Law Judge accepts jurisdiction over an 
appeal, subsequent initiation of an adjudication of the matter by a 
court of competent jurisdiction will not preclude the Administrative Law 
Judge from rendering a final decision on the matter.
    (c) Jurisdiction of the Administrative Law Judge in a suspension 
case is limited to the issue of whether the protection of the 
Government's interest requires suspension pending resolution of the 
termination action, unless the Administrative Law Judge has consolidated 
the suspension appeal with the corresponding termination appeal.

[[Page 342]]


<R05>
Sec. 134.406  Review of the administrative record.

    (a) Except as provided in Sec. 134.407, any proceeding conducted 
under this subpart shall be decided solely on a review of the written 
administrative record.
    (b) The Administrative Law Judge's review is limited to determining 
whether the Agency's determination is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary 
to law. As long as the Agency's determination is reasonable, the 
Administrative Law Judge must uphold it on appeal.
    (c) The administrative record must contain all documents that are 
relevant to the determination on appeal before the Administrative Law 
Judge and upon which the SBA decision-maker relied. The administrative 
record, however, need not contain all documents pertaining to the 
petitioner. For example, the administrative record in a termination 
proceeding need not include the Participant's entire business plan file, 
documents pertaining to specific 8(a) contracts, or the firm's 
application for participation in the 8(a) BD program if they are 
unrelated to the termination action. The petitioner may object to the 
absence of a document, previously submitted to or sent by SBA, which the 
petitioner believes was erroneously omitted from the administrative 
record.
    (d) Where the Agency files its answer to the appeal petition after 
the date specified in Sec. 134.206, the Administrative Law Judge may 
decline to consider the answer and base his or her decision solely on a 
review of the administrative record.
    (e) The Administrative Law Judge may remand a case to the AA/8(a)BD 
(or, in the case of a denial of a request for waiver under Sec. 124.515 
of this title, to the Administrator) for further consideration if he or 
she determines that, due to the absence in the written administrative 
record of the reasons upon which the determination was based, the 
administrative record is insufficiently complete to decide whether the 
determination is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law, or where it 
is clearly apparent from the record that SBA made an erroneous factual 
finding (e.g., SBA double counted an asset of an individual claiming 
disadvantaged status) or a mistake of law (e.g., SBA applied the wrong 
regulatory provision in evaluating the case). Such a remand will be for 
a period of 10 working days.


<R05>
Sec. 134.407  Evidence beyond the record and discovery.

    (a) The Administrative Law Judge may not admit evidence beyond the 
written administrative record nor permit any form of discovery unless he 
or she first determines that the petitioner, upon written submission, 
has made a substantial showing, based on credible evidence and not mere 
allegation, that the Agency determination in question may have resulted 
from bad faith or improper behavior.
    (1) Prior to any such determination, the Administrative Law Judge 
must permit SBA to respond in writing to any allegations of bad faith or 
improper behavior.
    (2) Upon a determination by the Administrative Law Judge that the 
petitioner has made such a substantial showing, the Administrative Law 
Judge may permit appropriate discovery, and accept relevant evidence 
beyond the written administrative record, which is specifically limited 
to the alleged bad faith or improper behavior.
    (b) A determination by the Administrative Law Judge that the 
required showing set forth in paragraph (a) of this section has been 
made does not shift the burden of proof, which continues to rest with 
the petitioner.


<R05>
Sec. 134.408  Decision on appeal.

    (a) A decision of the Administrative Law Judge under this subpart is 
the final agency decision, and is binding on the parties.
    (b) The Administrative Law Judge shall issue a decision, insofar as 
practicable, within 90 days after an appeal petition is filed. If the 
Administrative Law Judge does not issue a decision within 90 days after 
an appeal petition is filed, he or she must indicate the reason that the 
90-day time limit has not been met in the decision, when issued.
    (c) The Administrative Law Judge may reconsider an appeal decision 
within 20 days of the decision if there

[[Page 343]]

is a clear showing of an error of fact or law material to the decision.

      Subpart E--Implementation of the Equal Access to Justice Act

    Source: 61 FR 2683, Jan. 29, 1996. Redesignated at 63 FR 35766, June 
30, 1998.


<R05>
Sec. 134.501  What is the purpose of this subpart?

    The Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. 504, establishes 
procedures by which prevailing parties in certain administrative 
proceedings may apply for reimbursement of fees and other expenses. 
Eligible parties may receive awards when they prevail over SBA, unless 
SBA's position in the proceeding was ``substantially justified'' or, as 
provided in Sec. 134.405(b), special circumstances make an award unjust. 
The rules of this subpart explain which OHA proceedings are covered, who 
may be eligible for an award of fees and expenses, and how to apply for 
such an award.


<R05>
Sec. 134.502  Under what circumstances may I apply for reimbursement?

    You may apply for reimbursement under this subpart if you meet the 
eligibility requirements in Sec. 134.406 and you prevail over SBA in a 
final decision in:
    (a) The type of administrative proceeding which qualifies as an 
``adversary adjudication'' under Sec. 134.403; or
    (b) An ancillary or subsidiary issue in that administrative 
proceeding that is sufficiently significant and discrete to merit 
treatment as a separate unit; or
    (c) A matter which the agency orders to be determined as an 
``adversary adjudication'' under 5 U.S.C. 554.


<R05>
Sec. 134.503  What is an adversary adjudication?

    For purposes of this subpart, adversary adjudications are 
administrative proceedings before OHA which involve SBA as a party and 
which are required to be conducted by an Administrative Law Judge 
(``ALJ''). These adjudications (``administrative proceedings'') include 
those proceedings listed in Sec. 134.102 (a), (i), and (j)(1), but do 
not include other OHA proceedings such as those listed in 
Sec. 134.102(k). In order for an administrative proceeding to qualify, 
SBA must have been represented by counsel or by another representative 
who enters an appearance and participates in the proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 134.504  What benefits may I claim?

    You may seek reimbursement for certain reasonable fees and expenses 
incurred in prosecuting or defending a claim in an administrative 
proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 134.505  Under what circumstances are fees and expenses reimbursable?

    (a) If you are a prevailing eligible party, you may receive an award 
for reasonable fees and expenses unless the position of the agency in 
the proceeding is found by the ALJ to be ``substantially justified'', or 
special circumstances exist which make an award unjust. The ``position 
of the agency'' includes not only the position taken by SBA in the 
administrative proceeding, but also the position which it took in the 
action which led to the administrative proceeding. No presumption arises 
that SBA's position was not substantially justified simply because it 
did not prevail in a proceeding. However, upon your assertion that the 
position of SBA was not substantially justified, SBA will be required to 
establish that its position was reasonable in fact and law.
    (b) The ALJ may reduce or deny an award for reimbursement if you 
have unreasonably protracted the administrative proceeding or if other 
special circumstances would make the award unjust.
    (c) Awards for fees and expenses incurred before the date on which 
an administrative proceeding was initiated are allowable only if you can 
demonstrate that they were reasonably incurred in preparation for the 
proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 134.506  Who is eligible for possible reimbursement?

    (a) You are eligible for possible reimbursement if:
    (1) You are an individual, owner of an unincorporated business, 
partnership, corporation, association, organization, or unit of local 
government; and

[[Page 344]]

    (2) You are a party, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 551(3); and
    (3) You are the prevailing party; and
    (4) You meet certain net worth and employee eligibility requirements 
set forth in Sec. 134.407.
    (b) You are not eligible for possible reimbursement if you 
participated in the administrative proceeding only on behalf of persons 
or entities that are ineligible.


<R05>
Sec. 134.507  How do I know which eligibility requirement applies to me?

    Follow this chart to determine your eligibility. You should 
calculate your net worth and the number of your employees as of the date 
the administrative proceeding was initiated.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
If your participation in the proceeding
                  was:                      Eligibility requirements:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) As an individual rather than a       (1) Personal net worth may not
 business owner.                          exceed 2 million dollars.
(2) As owner of an unincorporated        (2) Personal net worth may not
 business.                                exceed 7 million dollars, and
                                         No more than 500 employees.
(3) As a partnership, corporation,       (3) Business net worth may not
 association, organization, or unit of    exceed 7 million dollars, and
 local government.                       No more than 500 employees.
(4) As a charitable or other tax-exempt  (4) No net worth limitations,
 organization described in 26 U.S.C.      and
 501(c)(3) or a cooperative association  No more than 500 employees.
 as defined in 12 U.S.C. 1141j(a).
------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 134.508  What are the special rules for calculating net worth and number of employees?

    (a) Your net worth must include the value of any assets disposed of 
for the purpose of meeting an eligibility standard, and must exclude any 
obligation incurred for that purpose. Transfers of assets, or 
obligations incurred, for less than reasonably equivalent value will be 
presumed to have been made for the purpose of meeting an eligibility 
standard.
    (b) If you are an owner of an unincorporated business, or a 
partnership, corporation, association, organization, or unit of local 
government, your net worth must include the net worth of all of your 
affiliates. ``Affiliates'' are:
    (1) Corporations or other business entities which directly or 
indirectly own or control a majority of the voting shares or other 
ownership interests in the applicant concern; and
    (2) Corporations or other business entities in which the applicant 
concern directly or indirectly owns or controls a majority of the voting 
shares or other ownership interests.
    (c) Your employees include all those persons regularly working for 
you at the time the administrative proceeding was initiated, whether or 
not they were at work on that date. Part-time employees must be included 
on a proportional basis. You must include the employees of all your 
affiliates in your total number of employees.


<R05>
Sec. 134.509  What is the difference between a fee and an expense?

    A fee is a charge to you for the professional services of attorneys, 
agents, or expert witnesses rendered in connection with your case. An 
expense is the cost to you of any study, analysis, engineering report, 
test, project, or similar matter prepared in connection with your case.


<R05>
Sec. 134.510  Are there limitations on reimbursement for fees and expenses?

    (a) Awards will be calculated on the basis of fees and expenses 
actually incurred. If services were provided by one or more of your 
employees, or were made available to you free, you may not seek an award 
for those services. If services were provided at a reduced rate, fees 
and expenses will be calculated at that reduced rate.
    (b) In determining the reasonableness of the fees for attorneys, 
agents or expert witnesses, the ALJ will consider at least the 
following:
    (1) That provider's customary fee for like services;
    (2) The prevailing rate for similar services in the community in 
which that provider ordinarily performs services;
    (3) The time actually spent in representing you; and
    (4) The time reasonably spent in light of the difficulty and 
complexity of the issues.

[[Page 345]]

    (c) An award for the fees of an attorney or agent may not exceed $75 
per hour, and an award for the fees of an expert witness may not exceed 
$25 per hour, regardless of the rate charged.
    (d) An award for the reasonable cost of any study, analysis, 
engineering report, test, project or similar matter prepared on your 
behalf may not exceed the prevailing rate payable for similar services, 
and you may be reimbursed only if the study or other matter was 
necessary to the preparation of your case.


<R05>
Sec. 134.511  What should I include in my application for an award?

    (a) Your application must be in the form of a written petition which 
is served and filed in accordance with Sec. 134.204. It must contain the 
following information:
    (1) A statement that OHA has jurisdiction over the case pursuant to 
Sec. 134.102(g);
    (2) Identification of the administrative proceeding for which you 
are seeking an award;
    (3) A statement that you have prevailed, and a list of each issue in 
which you claim the position of SBA was not substantially justified;
    (4) Your status as an individual, owner of an unincorporated 
business, partnership, corporation, association, organization, or unit 
of local government;
    (5) Your net worth and number of employees as of the date the 
administrative proceeding was initiated, or a statement that one or both 
of these eligibility requirements do not apply to you;
    (6) The amount of fees and expenses you are seeking, along with the 
invoice or billing statement from each service provider;
    (7) A description of any affiliates (as that term is defined in 
Sec. 134.408), or a statement that no affiliates exist;
    (8) A statement that the application and any attached statements and

you understand a false statement on these documents is a felony 
punishable by fine and imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. 1001; and
    (9)(i) Your name and address;
    (ii) Your signature, or the signature of either a responsible 
official or your attorney; and

occurred.

[[Page 346]]

    (b) The net worth exhibit must be filed with your application, but 
will not be part of the public record of the proceeding. Further, in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 134.204(g), you need not serve 
your net worth exhibit on other parties.


<R05>
Sec. 134.513  What documentation do I need for fees and expenses?

    You must submit a separate itemized statement or invoice for the 
services of each provider for which you seek reimbursement. Each 
separate statement or invoice must contain:
    (a) The hours worked in connection with the proceeding by each 
provider supplying a billable service;
    (b) A description of the specific services performed by each 
provider;
    (c) The rate at which fees were computed for each provider;
    (d) The total charged by the provider on that statement or invoice; 
and
    (e) The provider's verification that the statement or invoice is 
true to the best of his or her knowledge and that he or she understands

Sec. 134.514  What deadlines apply to my application for an award and where do I send it?

    After you have prevailed in an administrative proceeding or in a 
discrete issue therein, you must serve, and file with OHA, your written 
application for an award, and its attachments, no later than 30 days 
after the decision in the administrative proceeding becomes final under 
Sec. 134.227. The deadline for filing an application for an award may 
not be extended. If SBA or another party requests review of the decision 
in the underlying administrative proceeding, your request for an award 
for fees and expenses may still be filed, but it will not be considered 
by the ALJ until a final decision is rendered.


<R05>

on your eligibility, on whether SBA's position was substantially 
justified, and on the reasonableness of the amount you requested. Where 
applicable, there will also be findings on whether you have unduly 
protracted the proceedings or whether other circumstances make an award 
unjust, and an explanation of the reason for the difference, if any, 
between the amount requested and the amount awarded. If you have sought 
an award against more than one federal agency, the decision will 
allocate responsibility for payment among the agencies with appropriate 
explanation.


<R05>
Sec. 134.517  May I seek review of the ALJ's decision on my award?

    You may request review of the ALJ's decision on your award by filing

conducted programs or activities.


<R05>
Secs. 136.141--136.148  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 136.149  Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

    Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 136.150, no qualified 
individual with handicaps shall, because the Agency's facilities are 
inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with handicaps, be denied the 
benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be 
subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by 
the Agency.


<R05>
Sec. 136.150  Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

    (a) General. The Agency shall operate each program or activity so 
that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily 
accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This paragraph 
does not--
    (1) Necessarily require the Agency to make each of its existing 
facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps; or
    (2) Require the Agency to take any action that it can demonstrate 
would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or 
activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those 
circumstances where Agency personnel believe that the proposed action 
would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in 
undue financial and administrative burdens, the Agency has the burden of 
proving that compliance with Sec. 136.150(a) would result in such 
alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such 
alteration or burdens must be made by the Administrator or Deputy 
Administrator after considering all Agency resources available for use 
in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity and 
must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching 
that conclusion. The Administrator or Deputy Administrator's decision 
shall be made within 30 days of the initial decision by Agency personnel 
that an action would result in such an alteration or burdens. If an 
action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the Agency 
shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration 
or such burdens but would, nevertheless, ensure that individuals with 
handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.
    (b) Methods. The Agency may comply with the requirements of this 
section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of 
services to accessible buildings, assignment of aids to beneficiaries, 
home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, 
alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, 
use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in 
making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by 
individuals with handicaps. The Agency is not required to make 
structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are 
effective in achieving compliance with this section. The Agency, in 
making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility 
requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act 
of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations 
implementing it. In choosing among

[[Page 351]]

available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the 
Agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and 
activities to qualified individuals with handicaps in the most 
integrated setting appropriate.
    (c) Time period for compliance. The Agency shall comply with the 
obligations established under this section by September 13, 1988, except 
that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes 
shall be made by July 15, 1991, but in any event as expeditiously as 
possible.
    (d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to 
facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the 
Agency shall develop, by January 16, 1989, a transition plan setting 
forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The Agency shall 
provide an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with 
handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to 
participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting 
comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be 
made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum:
    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the Agency's facilities that 
limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals 
with handicaps;
    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;
    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition 
plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during 
each year of the transition period; and
    (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the 
plan.


<R05>
Sec. 136.151  Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.

    Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered 
by, on behalf if, or for the use of the Agency shall be designed, 
constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by 
individuals with handicaps. The definitions, requirements, and standards 
of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established 
in 41 CFR 101-19.600--101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this 
section.


<R05>
Secs. 136.152--136.159  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 136.160  Communications.

    (a) The Agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective 
communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal 
entities, and members of the public.
    (1) The Agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where 
necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to 
participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity 
conducted by the Agency.
    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the 
Agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the 
individual with handicaps.
    (ii) The Agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, 
readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal 
nature.
    (2) Where the Agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries 
by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or 
equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used.
    (b) The Agency shall ensure that interested persons, including 
persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to 
the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and 
facilities.
    (c) The Agency shall provide a sign at each primary entrance to each 
of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which 
they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The 
international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary 
entrance of an accessible facility.
    (d) This section does not require the Agency to take any action that 
it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the 
nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative 
burdens. In those circumstances where Agency personnel believe that the 
proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or 
would result in undue financial and administrative burdens,

[[Page 352]]

the Agency has the burden of proving that compliance with Sec. 136.160 
would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance 
would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the 
Administrator or Deputy Administrator after considering all Agency 
resources available for use in the funding and operation of the 
conducted program or activity and must be accompanied by a written 
statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. The Administrator 
or Deputy Administrator's decision shall be made within 30 days of the 
initial decision by Agency personnel that an action would result in such 
an alteration or burdens. If an action required to comply with this 
section would result in such as alteration or such burdens, the Agency 
shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration 
or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum 
extent possible, individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and 
services of the program or activity.

including the conduct of any investigation, hearing, or proceeding under 
this part, or to cooperate with the Office of Inspector General in the 
performance of its responsibilities under the Inspector General Act of 
1978, as amended.
    (3) When to file. Complaints shall be filed within 180 days of the 
alleged act of discrimination, except when this deadline is extended by

this section and over which the Agency has jurisdiction. The Chief, 
OCRC, shall notify the complainant and the respondent of receipt and 
acceptance of the complaint.
    (2) If the Chief, OCRC, receives a complaint that is not complete, 
he or she shall notify the complainant, within 30 days of receipt of the 
incomplete complaint, that additional information is needed. If the 
complainant fails to

[[Page 353]]

furnish the necessary information within 30 days of receipt of this 
notice, the Chief, OCRC, shall dismiss the complaint without prejudice.
    (3) If the Chief, OCRC, receives a complaint over which the Agency 
does not have jurisdiction, he or she shall promptly notify the 
complainant and shall make reasonable efforts to refer the complaint to 
the appropriate Government entity.
    (f) Investigation/Conciliation. (1) Within 180 days of the receipt 
of a complete complaint the Chief, OCRC, shall complete the 
investigation of the complaint and attempt informal resolution. If no 
informal resolution is achieved, the Chief, OCRC, shall issue a letter 
of findings.
    (2) The Chief, OCRC, may require Agency employees to cooperate in 
the investigation and attempted resolution of complaints. Employees who 
are required to participate in any investigation under this section 
shall do so as part of their official duties and during regular duty 
hours.
    (3) The Chief, OCRC, shall furnish the complainant and the 
respondent with a copy of the investigative report and provide the 
complainant and respondent with an opportunity for informal resolution 
of the complaint.
    (4) If a complaint is resolved informally, the terms of the 
agreement shall be reduced to writing and made part of the complaint 
file, with a copy of the agreement provided to the complainant and 
respondent. The written agreement may include a finding on the issue of 
discrimination and shall describe any corrective action to which the 
complainant and respondent have agreed.
    (g) Letter of findings. If an informal resolution of the complaint 
is not reached, the Chief, OCRC, shall, within 180 days of receipt of 
the complete complaint, notify the complainant, the respondent and the 
Director, Office of Equal Employment Opportunity and Compliance (OEEOC), 
of the results of the investigation in a letter sent by certified mail, 
return receipt requested, and containing--
    (1) Findings of fact and conclusions of law;
    (2) A description of a remedy for each violation found;
    (3) A notice of the right of the complainant and respondent to 
appeal to the Director, OEEOC; and
    (4) A notice of the right of the complainant and respondent to 
request a hearing.
    The letter of findings becomes the final Agency decision if neither 
party files an appeal within the time prescribed in paragraph (h)(1) of 
this section. The Chief, OCRC, shall certify that the letter of findings 
is the final Agency decision on the complaint at the expiration of that 
time.
    (h) Filing an appeal. (1) Any notice of appeal to the Director, 
OEEOC, with or without a request for hearing, shall be filed by the 
complainant or the respondent in writing with the Chief, OCRC, within 30 
days of receipt from him or her of the letter required by paragraph (g) 
of this section. The notice shall be accompanied by a certificate of 
service attesting that the party has served a copy of his or her notice 
of appeal on all other parties to the proceeding. The Director, OEEOC, 
may extend this time limit for good cause shown pursuant to the 
procedure in paragraph (h)(3) of this section.
    (2) If a timely notice of appeal without a request for hearing is 
filed, any other party may file a written request for hearing within the 
time limit specified in paragraph (h)(1) of this section or within 10 
days of his or her receipt of such notice of appeal, whichever is later.
    (3) A party may appeal to the Director, OEEOC, from a decision of 
the Chief, OCRC, that an appeal is untimely. This appeal shall be filed 
with the Director, OEEOC, within 15 days of receipt of the decision from 
the Chief, OCRC.
    (4) Any request for hearing will be construed as a request for an 
oral hearing. The complainant's failure to file a timely request for a 
hearing in accordance with this part shall constitute waiver of the 
right to a hearing, but shall not preclude his or her submitting written 
information and argument to the Director, OEEOC, in connection with his 
or her notice of appeal.
    (i) Acceptance of appeal. The Chief, OCRC, shall accept and process 
any timely filed appeal.

[[Page 354]]

    (1) If a notice of appeal is filed but no party requests a hearing, 
the Chief, OCRC, shall promptly transmit the complaint file, the letter 
of findings and the notice of appeal to the Director, OEEOC.
    (2) If a notice of appeal if filed and a party makes a timely 
request for a hearing, the Chief, OCRC, will transmit the notice of 
appeal, the request for hearing and the investigative file to the Office 
of Hearings and Appeals which office will assign the case to an 
administrative judge who will conduct a hearing in accordance with the 
procedures contained in 13 CFR part 134.
    (j) Decision. (1) Where no request for a hearing is made, the 
Director, OEEOC, shall make the final Agency decision based on the 
contents of the complaint file, the letter of findings, the notice of 
appeal, and any responses to the notice of appeal filed by other 
parties. The decision shall be made within 60 days of receipt of the 
appeal or any response to the notice of appeal, whichever is applicable. 
If the Director, OEEOC, determines that he or she needs additional 
information from any party, he or she shall request the information and 
provide the other party or parties an opportunity to respond to that 
information. The Director, OEEOC, shall have 60 days from receipt of the 
additional information or responses to such additional information, 
whichever is later, to make the decision. The Director, OEEOC, shall 
transmit his or her decision in writing to the parties. The decision 
shall set forth the findings, remedial actions, and reasons for the 
decision.
    (2) Where a request for a hearing has been made, the administrative 
judge shall issue an initial decision, in writing, based on the hearing 
record, composed of the proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law, 
and remedies, to the parties and to the Director, OEEOC, within 30 days 
after receipt of the hearing transcripts, or within 30 days after the 
conclusion of the hearing if no transcript is made. This time limit may 
be extended with the permission of the Director, OEEOC. The decision of 
the administrative judge shall be deemed to be the final decision of the 
Agency after 30 days, unless a party files a petition for review with 
the Director, OEEOC, pursuant to 13 CFR 134.228(a) or the Director, 
OEEOC, issues an order stating his or her decision to review the initial 
decision, pursuant to 13 CFR 134.228(a). See 13 CFR 134.227(b).
    (3) Where a petition for review is filed or a review is ordered by

review, and any responses to the petition or order. The decision shall 
be made within 60 days of receipt of the petition for review, the order, 
or any responses to such petition or order, whichever is later. If the 
Director, OEEOC, determines that he or she needs additional information 
from any party, he or she shall request the information and provide the 
other party or parties an opportunity to respond to that information. 
The Director, OEEOC, shall have 60 days from receipt of the additional 
information or responses to such additional information, whichever is 
later, to make the decision. The Director, OEEOC, shall transmit his or 
her decision by letter to the parties. The decision shall set forth the

PART 140--DEBT COLLECTION THROUGH OFFSET--Table of Contents

<R05>


Sec.
140.1  What does this part cover?
140.2  What is a debt and how can the SBA collect it through offset?
140.3  What rights do you have when SBA tries to collect a debt from you 
          through offset?

    Authority: 31 U.S.C. 3711, Collection and compromise; 31 U.S.C. 
3720A, Reduction of tax refund by amount of debt; 5 U.S.C. 5514, 
Installment deduction for indebtedness to the United States; 31 U.S.C.

    Source: 60 FR 62191, Dec. 5, 1995, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 140.1  What does this part cover?

    This part establishes procedures which SBA may use in the 
collection, through offset, of past-due debts owed to the Government. 
SBA's failure to comply with any provision of the regulations in this 
part is not available to any debtor as a defense against collection of 
the debt through judicial process.


<R05>
Sec. 140.2  What is a debt and how can the SBA collect it through offset?

    (a) A debt means an amount owed to the United States from loans made 
or guaranteed by the United States, and from fees, leases, rents, 
royalties, services, sales of real or personal property, overpayments, 
fines, penalties, damages, interest, forfeitures, or any other source. 
You are a debtor if you owe an amount to the United States from any of 
these sources.
    (b) SBA may collect past-due debts through offset by using any of 
three procedures: administrative offset, salary offset, or IRS tax 
refund offset. A past-due debt is one which has been reduced to 
judgment, has been accelerated, or has been due for at least 90 days.
    (1) Administrative offset. SBA may withhold money it owes to the 
debtor in order to satisfy the debt. This procedure is an 
``administrative offset'' and is authorized by 31 U.S.C. 3716.
    (2) Salary offset. If the debtor is a federal employee (a civilian 
employee as defined by 5 U.S.C. 2105, an employee of the U.S. Postal 
Service or Postal Rate Commission, or a member of the Uniformed Services 
or Reserve of the Uniformed Services), SBA may deduct payments owed to 
SBA or another federal agency from the debtor's paycheck. This procedure 
is a ``salary offset'' and is authorized by 5 U.S.C. 5514.
    (i) Any amount deducted from salary in any one pay period will not 
exceed 15 percent of a debtor's disposable pay, unless the debtor agrees 
in writing to a greater percentage.
    (ii) SBA also may collect against travel advances, training 
expenses, disallowed payments, retirement benefits, or any other amount 
due the employee, including lump-sum payments.
    (iii) If an employee has terminated employment after salary offset 
has been initiated, there are no limitations on the amount that can be 
withheld or offset.
    (3) IRS tax refund offset. SBA may request that IRS reduce a 
debtor's tax refund by the amount of the debt, as authorized by 31 
U.S.C. 3720A. Where available, administrative and salary offsets must be 
used before collection is attempted through income tax offset. SBA may 
refer a debt to the IRS for a tax refund offset and take additional 
action against the debtor to collect the debt at the same time or in 
sequence. When SBA makes simultaneous or sequential referrals (within 
six months of the initial notice), only one review pursuant to the rules 
in this part and the statutes authorizing them is required.


<R05>
Sec. 140.3  What rights do you have when SBA tries to collect a debt from you through offset?

    (a) SBA must write to you and tell you that it proposes to collect 
the debt by reducing your federal paycheck, withholding money the 
Government

[[Page 356]]

owes you, and/or reducing your tax refund.
    (b) In its written notice to you, SBA must tell you the nature and 
amount of the debt; that SBA will begin procedures to collect the debt 
through reduction of your federal paycheck, administrative offset, or 
reduction of your tax refund; that you have an opportunity to inspect 
and copy Government records relating to the debt at your expense; and 
that, before collection begins, you have an opportunity to agree with 
SBA on a schedule for repayment of your debt.
    (c) SBA also must tell you that unless you respond within 60 days 
from the date of the notice, it will disclose to consumer reporting 
agencies (also known as credit bureaus or credit agencies) that you are 
responsible for the debt and the specific information it intends to 
disclose in order to establish your identity. The amount, status, 
history of the debt, and agency program under which it arose also will 
be disclosed.
    (d) If you respond to SBA within 60 days from the date of the 
notice, SBA will not disclose the information to consumer reporting 
agencies until it considers your response and determines that you owe a 
past-due, legally enforceable debt.
    (e) Within 60 days of the notice you may present evidence that all 
or part of the debt is not past due or not legally enforceable.
    (1) Where a salary offset or administrative offset is proposed, you 
will have the opportunity to present your evidence to SBA's Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (``OHA''). The rules in part 134 of this title 
govern the procedural rights to which you are entitled. In order to have 
a hearing before OHA, you must request a hearing within 15 days of 
receipt of the written notice described in this section. An OHA judge 
will issue a decision within 60 days of the date you filed your 
petition/request for a review or hearing with OHA, unless you were 
granted additional time within which to file your request for review.
    (2) Where an income tax refund offset is proposed, you will have the 
opportunity to request a review and present your evidence to the 
appropriate SBA Commercial Loan Servicing Center at the address provided 
in the notice.
    (f) SBA must consider any evidence you present and must first decide 
that a debt is past due and legally enforceable. A debt is legally 
enforceable if there is any forum, including a State or Federal Court or 
administrative agency, in which SBA's claim would not be barred on the 
date of offset. Non-judgment debts are enforceable for ten years; 
judgment debts are enforceable beyond ten years. You will be notified of 
SBA's decision at least 30 days before any offset deduction is made. You 
also will be notified of the amount, frequency, proposed beginning date, 
and duration of the deductions, as well as any obligation to pay 
interest, penalties, and administrative costs.
    (g) If there is any substantial change in the status or amount of 
your debt, SBA will promptly report that change to each consumer 
reporting agency it originally contacted.
    (h) SBA will obtain satisfactory assurances from each consumer 
reporting agency that the consumer reporting agency has complied with 
all federal laws relating to provision of consumer credit information.
    (i) If your debt is being repaid by reduction of your income tax 
refund and you make any additional payments to SBA, SBA will notify the 
IRS of these payments and your new balance within 10 business days of 
receiving your payment.
    (j) When the debt of a federal employee is reduced to court 
judgment, the employee is not entitled to further review by SBA, but is 
only entitled to notice of a proposed salary offset resulting from the 
judgment. The amount deducted may not exceed 15% of disposable pay, 
except when the deduction of a greater amount is necessary to completely 
collect the debt within the employee's remaining period of employment.
    (k) When another federal agency asks SBA to offset a debt for it, 
SBA will not initiate the requested offset until it has received from 
the creditor agency a written certification that the debtor owes a debt, 
its amount, and that the provisions of all applicable statutes and 
regulations have been complied with fully.

[[Page 357]]

    (l) SBA may make an offset prior to completion of the procedures 
described in this part, if:
    (1) Failure to make an offset would substantially prejudice the 
government's ability to collect the debt; and
    (2) The time before the payment would otherwise be made to you does 
not reasonably permit the completion of the procedures.
    (3) Such prior offset then must be followed by the completion of the 
procedures described in this part.
    (m) Where an IRS tax refund offset is sought, SBA must follow the 
Department of the Treasury's regulations governing offset of a past-due, 
legally enforceable debt against tax overpayment.

                        Overview and Definitions


<R05>
Sec. 142.1  Overview of regulations.

    (a) Statutory basis. This part implements the Program Fraud Civil 
Remedies Act of 1986, 31 U.S.C. 3801-3812 (``the Act''). The Act 
provides SBA and other federal agencies with an administrative remedy to 
impose civil penalties and assessments against persons making false 
claims and statements. The Act also provides due process protections to 
all persons who are subject to administrative proceedings under this 
part.
    (b) Possible remedies for program fraud. In addition to any other 
penalty which may be prescribed by law, a person who submits, or causes 
to be submitted, a false claim or a false statement to SBA

[[Page 358]]

is subject to a civil penalty of not more than $5,000 for each statement 
or claim, regardless of whether property, services, or money is actually 
delivered or paid by SBA. If SBA has made any payment, transferred 
property, or provided services in reliance on a false claim, the person 
submitting it is also subject to an assessment of not more than twice 
the amount of the false claim. This assessment is in lieu of damages 
sustained by SBA because of the false claim.


<R05>
Sec. 142.2  What kind of conduct will result in program fraud enforcement?

    (a) Any person who makes, or causes to be made, a false, fictitious, 
or fraudulent claim or written statement to SBA is subject to program 
fraud enforcement. A ``person'' means any individual, partnership, 
corporation, association, or other legal entity.
    (b) If more than one person makes a false claim or statement, each 
person is liable for a civil penalty. If more than one person makes a 
false claim which has induced SBA to make payment, an assessment is 
imposed against each person. The liability of each such person to pay 
the assessment is joint and several, that is, each is responsible for 
the entire amount.
    (c) No proof of specific intent to defraud is required to establish 
liability under this part.


<R05>
Sec. 142.3  What is a claim?

    (a) Claim means any request, demand, or submission:
    (1) Made to SBA for property, services, or money;
    (2) Made to a recipient of property, services, or money from SBA or 
to a party to a contract with SBA for property or services, or for the 
payment of money. This provision applies only when the claim is related 
to the property, services or money from SBA or to the contract with SBA; 
or
    (3) Made to SBA which decreases an obligation to pay or account for 
property, services, or money.
    (b) A claim can relate to grants, loans, insurance, or other 
benefits, and includes SBA guaranteed loans made by participating 
lenders. A claim is made when it is received by SBA, an agent, fiscal 
intermediary, or other entity acting for SBA, or when it is received by 
the recipient of property, services, or money, or the party to the 
contract.
    (c) Each voucher, invoice, claim form, or individual request or 
demand for property, services, or money constitutes a separate claim.


<R05>
Sec. 142.4  What is a statement?

    A ``statement'' means any written representation, certification, 
affirmation, document, record, or accounting or bookkeeping entry made 
with respect to a claim or with respect to a contract, bid or proposal 
for a contract, grant, loan or other benefit from SBA. ``From SBA'' 
means that SBA provides some portion of the money or property in 
connection with the contract, bid, grant, loan, or benefit, or is 
potentially liable to another party for some portion of the money or 
property under such contract, bid, grant, loan, or benefit. A statement 
is made, presented, or submitted to SBA when it is received by SBA or an 
agent, fiscal intermediary, or other entity acting for SBA.


<R05>
Sec. 142.5  What is a false claim or statement?

    (a) A claim submitted to SBA is a ``false'' claim if the person 
making the claim, or causing the claim to be made, knows or has reason 
to know that the claim:
    (1) Is false, fictitious or fraudulent;
    (2) Includes or is supported by a written statement which asserts or 
contains a material fact which is false, fictitious, or fraudulent;
    (3) Includes or is supported by a written statement which is false, 
fictitious or fraudulent because it omits a material fact that the 
person making the statement has a duty to include in the statement; or
    (4) Is for payment for the provision of property or services which 
the person has not provided as claimed.
    (b) A statement submitted to SBA is a false statement if the person 
making the statement, or causing the statement to be made, knows or has 
reason to know that the statement:
    (1) Asserts a material fact which is false, fictitious, or 
fraudulent; or

[[Page 359]]

    (2) Is false, fictitious, or fraudulent because it omits a material 
fact that the person making the statement has a duty to include in the 
statement. In addition, the statement must contain or be accompanied by 
an express certification or affirmation of the truthfulness and accuracy 
of the contents of the statement.


<R05>
Sec. 142.6  What does the phrase ``know or have reason to know'' mean?

    A person knows or has reason to know (that a claim or statement is 
false) if the person:
    (a) Has actual knowledge that the claim or statement is false, 
fictitious, or fraudulent; or
    (b) Acts in deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity of the 
claim or statement; or
    (c) Acts in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the claim 
or statement.

              Procedures Leading to Issuance of a Complaint


<R05>
Sec. 142.7  Who investigates program fraud?

    The Inspector General, or his designee, is responsible for 
investigating allegations that a false claim or statement has been made. 
In this regard, the Inspector General has authority under the Program 
Fraud Civil Remedies Act and the Inspector General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. 
App. 3), as amended, to issue administrative subpoenas for the 
production of records and documents. The methods for serving a subpoena 
are set forth in part 101 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 142.8  What happens if program fraud is suspected?

    (a) If the investigating official concludes that an action under 
this part is warranted, the investigating official submits a report 
containing the findings and conclusions of the investigation to a 
reviewing official. The reviewing official is the General Counsel or his 
designee. If the reviewing official determines that the report provides 
adequate evidence that a person submitted a false claim or statement, 
the reviewing official transmits to the Attorney General written notice 
of an intention to refer the matter for adjudication, with a request for 
approval of such referral. This notice will include the reviewing 
official's statements concerning:
    (1) The reasons for the referral;
    (2) The claims or statements upon which liability would be based;
    (3) The evidence that supports liability;
    (4) An estimate of the amount of money or the value of property, 
services, or other benefits requested or demanded in the false claim or 
statement;
    (5) Any exculpatory or mitigating circumstances that may relate to 
the claims or statements known by the reviewing official or the 
investigating official; and
    (6) The likelihood of collecting the proposed penalties and 
assessments.
    (b) If at any time, the Attorney General or designee requests in 
writing that this administrative process be stayed, the Administrator 
must stay the process immediately. The Administrator may order the 
process resumed only upon receipt of the written authorization of the 
Attorney General.


<R05>
Sec. 142.9  When will SBA issue a complaint?

    SBA will issue a complaint:
    (a) If the Attorney General (or designee) approves the referral of 
the allegations for adjudication; and
    (b) In a case of submission of false claims, if the amount of money 
or the value of property or services demanded or requested in a false 
claim, or a group of related claims submitted at the same time, does not 
exceed $150,000. A group of related claims submitted at the same time 
includes only those claims arising from the same transaction (such as a 
grant, loan, application, or contract) which are submitted together as 
part of a single request, demand, or submission.


<R05>
Sec. 142.10  What is contained in a complaint?

    (a) A complaint is a written statement giving notice to the person 
alleged to be liable under 31 U.S.C. 3802 of the specific allegations 
being referred for adjudication and of the person's right to request a 
hearing with respect

[[Page 360]]

to those allegations. The person alleged to have made false statements 
or to have submitted false claims to SBA is referred to as the 
``defendant.''
    (b) The reviewing official may join in a single complaint false 
claims or statements that are unrelated or were not submitted 
simultaneously, regardless of the amount of money or the value of 
property or services demanded or requested.
    (c) The complaint will state that SBA seeks to impose civil 
penalties, assessments, or both, against each defendant and will 
include:
    (1) The allegations of liability against each defendant, including 
the statutory basis for liability, identification of the claims or 
statements involved, and the reasons liability allegedly arises from 
such claims or statements;
    (2) The maximum amount of penalties and assessments for which each 
defendant may be held liable;
    (3) A statement that each defendant may request a hearing by filing 
an answer and may be represented by a representative;

    (5) A warning that failure to file an answer within 30 days of 
service of the complaint will result in imposition of the maximum amount 
of penalties and assessments.
    (d) The reviewing official must serve any complaint on the defendant 
and provide a copy to the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA). If a 
hearing is requested, an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) from OHA will 
serve as the Presiding Officer.


<R05>
Sec. 142.11  How will the complaint be served?

    (a) The complaint must be served on individual defendants directly, 
a partnership through a general partner, and on corporations or on 
unincorporated associations through an executive officer or a director, 
except that service also may be made on any person authorized by 
appointment or by law to receive process for the defendant.
    (b) The complaint may be served either by:
    (1) Registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) 
addressed to the defendant at his or her residence, usual dwelling 
place, principal office or place of business; or by
    (2) Personal delivery by anyone 18 years of age or older.

postal receipt will serve as proof of service.
    (2) When service is made by personal delivery, an affidavit of the 
individual serving the complaint, or written acknowledgment of receipt 
by the defendant or a representative, will serve as proof of service.
    (e) When served with the complaint, the defendant also should be 
served with a copy of this part 142 and 31 U.S.C. 3801-3812.

               Procedures Following Service of a Complaint


<R05>
Sec. 142.12  How does a defendant respond to the complaint?

    (a) A defendant may file an answer with the reviewing official and 
the Office of Hearings and Appeals within 30 days of service of the 
complaint. An answer will be considered a request for an oral hearing.
    (b) In the answer, a defendant--
    (1) Must admit or deny each of the allegations of liability 
contained in the complaint (a failure to deny an allegation is 
considered an admission);
    (2) Must state any defense on which the defendant intends to rely;
    (3) May state any reasons why he or she believes the penalties, 
assessments, or both should be less than the statutory maximum; and
    (4) Must state the name, address, and telephone number of the person 
authorized by the defendant to act as defendant's representative, if 
any.
    (c) If the defendant is unable to file an answer which meets the 
requirements set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, the defendant 
may file with the reviewing official a general answer denying liability, 
requesting a hearing, and requesting an extension of time in

[[Page 361]]

which to file a complete answer. A general answer must be filed within 
30 days of service of the complaint.
    (d) If the defendant initially files a general answer requesting an 
extension of time, the reviewing official must promptly file with the 
ALJ the complaint, the general answer, and the request for an extension 
of time.
    (e) For good cause shown, the ALJ may grant the defendant up to 30 
additional days within which to file an answer meeting the requirements 
of paragraph (b) of this section. Such answer must be filed with OHA and 
a copy must be served on the reviewing official.


<R05>
Sec. 142.13  What happens if a defendant fails to file an answer?

    (a) If a defendant does not file any answer within 30 days after 
service of the complaint, the reviewing official will refer the 
complaint to the ALJ.
    (b) Once the complaint is referred, the ALJ will promptly serve on 
the defendant a notice that an initial decision will be issued.
    (c) The ALJ will assume the facts alleged in the complaint to be 
true and, if such facts establish liability under the statute, the ALJ 
will issue an initial decision imposing the maximum amount of penalties 
and assessments allowed under the statute.
    (d) Except as otherwise provided in this section, when a defendant 
fails to file a timely answer, the defendant waives any right to further 
review of the penalties and assessments imposed in the initial decision.
    (e) The initial decision becomes final 30 days after it is issued.
    (f) If, at any time before an initial decision becomes final, a 
defendant files a motion with the ALJ asking that the case be reopened 
and describing the extraordinary circumstances that prevented the 
defendant from filing an answer, the initial decision will be stayed 
until the ALJ makes a decision on the motion. The reviewing official may 
respond to the motion.
    (g) If, in his motion to reopen, a defendant demonstrates 
extraordinary circumstances excusing his failure to file a timely 
answer, the ALJ will withdraw the initial decision, and grant the 
defendant an opportunity to answer the complaint.
    (h) A decision by the ALJ to deny a defendant's motion to reopen a 
case is not subject to review or reconsideration.


<R05>
Sec. 142.14  What happens once an answer is filed?

    (a) When the reviewing official receives an answer, he must file 
concurrently, the complaint and the answer with the ALJ, along with a 
designation of an SBA representative.
    (b) When the ALJ receives the complaint and the answer, the ALJ will 
promptly serve a notice of oral hearing upon the defendant and the 
representative for SBA, in the same manner as the complaint, service of 
which is described in Sec. 142.11. The notice of oral hearing must be 
served within six years of the date on which the claim or statement is 
made.
    (c) The notice must include:
    (1) The tentative time, place and nature of the hearing;
    (2) The legal authority and jurisdiction under which the hearing is 
to be held;
    (3) The matters of fact and law to be asserted;
    (4) A description of the procedures for the conduct of the hearing;
    (5) The name, address, and telephone number of the defendant's 
representative and the representative for SBA; and
    (6) Such other matters as the ALJ deems appropriate.

                           Hearing Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 142.15  What kind of hearing is contemplated?

    The hearing is a formal proceeding conducted by the ALJ during which 
a defendant will have the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses, 
present testimony, and dispute liability.

    An ALJ from OHA serves as the Presiding Officer at all hearings, 
with authority as set forth in Sec. 134.218(b) of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 142.18  Can the reviewing official or ALJ be disqualified?

    (a) A reviewing official or an ALJ may disqualify himself or herself 
at any time.
    (b) Upon motion of any party, the reviewing official or ALJ may be 
disqualified as follows:
    (1) The motion must be supported by an affidavit containing specific 
facts establishing that personal bias or other reason for 
disqualification exists, including the time and circumstances of the 
discovery of such facts;
    (2) The motion must be filed promptly after discovery of the grounds 
for disqualification, or the objection will be deemed waived; and
    (3) The party, or representative of record, must certify in writing 
that the motion is made in good faith.
    (c) Once a motion has been filed to disqualify the reviewing 
official, the ALJ will halt the proceedings until resolving the matter 
of disqualification. If the ALJ determines that the reviewing official 
is disqualified, the ALJ will dismiss the complaint without prejudice. 
If the ALJ disqualifies himself or herself, the case will be promptly 
reassigned to another ALJ.


<R05>
Sec. 142.19  How are issues brought to the attention of the ALJ?

    All applications to the ALJ for an order or ruling are made by 
motion, stating the relief sought, the authority relied upon, and the 
facts alleged. Procedures for filing motions under this section are 
governed by Sec. 134.211 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 142.20  How are papers served?

    Except for service of a complaint or a notice of hearing under 
Secs. 142.11 and 142.14(b) respectively, service of papers must be made 
as prescribed by Sec. 134.204 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 142.21  How will the hearing be conducted and who has the burden of proof?

    (a) The ALJ conducts a hearing in order to determine whether a 
defendant is liable for a civil penalty, assessment, or both and, if so, 
the appropriate amount of the civil penalty and/or assessment. The 
hearing will be recorded and transcribed, and the transcript of 
testimony, exhibits admitted at the hearing, and all papers and requests 
filed in the proceeding constitute the record for a decision by the ALJ.
    (b) SBA must prove a defendant's liability and any aggravating 
factors by a preponderance of the evidence.
    (c) A defendant must prove any affirmative defenses and any 
mitigating factors by a preponderance of the evidence.
    (d) The hearing will be open to the public unless otherwise ordered 
by the ALJ for good cause shown.


<R05>
Sec. 142.22  How is evidence presented at the hearing?

    (a) Witnesses at the hearing must testify orally under oath or 
affirmation unless otherwise ordered by the ALJ. At the discretion of 
the ALJ, testimony may be admitted in the form of a written statement or 
deposition, a copy of which must be provided to all other parties, along 
with the last known address of the witness, in a manner which allows 
sufficient time for other parties to subpoena the witness for cross-
examination at the hearing.

[[Page 363]]

    (b) The ALJ determines the admissibility of evidence in accordance 
with Sec. 134.223 (a) and (b) of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 142.23  Are there limits on disclosure of documents or discovery?

    (a) Upon written request to the reviewing official, the defendant 
may review all non-privileged, relevant and material documents, records 
and other material related to the allegations contained in the 
complaint. After paying SBA a reasonable fee for duplication, the 
defendant may obtain a copy of the records described.
    (b) Upon written request to the reviewing official, the defendant 
may obtain a copy of all exculpatory information in the possession of 
the reviewing official or investigating official relating to the 
allegations in the complaint. If the document would otherwise be 
privileged, only the portion of the document containing exculpatory 
information must be disclosed. As used in this section, the term 
``information'' does not include legal materials such as statutes or 
case law obtained through legal research.
    (c) The notice sent to the Attorney General from the reviewing 
official is not discoverable under any circumstances.
    (d) Other discovery is available only as ordered by the ALJ and 
includes only those methods of discovery allowed by Sec. 134.213 of this 
chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 142.24  Can witnesses be subpoenaed?

    A party seeking the appearance and testimony of any individual or 
the production of documents or records at a hearing may request in 
writing that the ALJ issue a subpoena. Any such request must be filed 
with the ALJ not less than 15 days before the scheduled hearing date 
unless otherwise allowed by the ALJ for good cause. A subpoena shall be 
issued by the ALJ in the manner specified by Sec. 134.214 of this 
chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 142.25  Can a party or witness object to discovery?

    Any party or prospective witness may file a motion to quash a 
subpoena or to limit discovery or the disclosure of evidence. Motions to 
limit discovery or to object to the disclosure of evidence are governed 
by Sec. 134.213 of this chapter. Motions to limit or quash subpoenas are 
governed by Sec. 134.214(d) of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 142.26  Can a party informally discuss the case with the ALJ?

    No. Such discussions are forbidden as ex parte communications with 
the ALJ as set forth in Sec. 134.220 of this chapter. This does not 
prohibit a party from communicating with other employees of OHA to 
inquire about the status of a case or to ask routine questions 
concerning administrative functions and procedures.


<R05>
Sec. 142.27  Are there sanctions for misconduct?

    The ALJ may sanction a party or representative, as set forth in 
Sec. 134.219 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 142.28  Where is the hearing held?

    The ALJ will hold the hearing in any judicial district of the United 
States:
    (a) In which the defendant resides or transacts business; or
    (b) In which the claim or statement on which liability is based was 
made, presented or submitted to SBA; or
    (c) As agreed upon by the defendant and the ALJ.


<R05>
Sec. 142.29  Are witness lists exchanged before the hearing?

    (a) At least 15 days before the hearing or at such other time as 
ordered by the ALJ, the parties must exchange witness lists and copies 
of proposed hearing exhibits, including copies of any written statements 
or transcripts of deposition testimony that the party intends to offer 
in lieu of live testimony.
    (b) If a party objects, the ALJ will not admit into evidence the 
testimony of any witness whose name does not appear on the witness list 
or any exhibit not provided to an opposing party unless the ALJ finds 
good cause for the omission or concludes that there is no prejudice to 
the objecting party.
    (c) Unless a party objects within the time set by the ALJ, documents 
exchanged in accordance with this section are deemed to be authentic for 
the purpose of admissibility at the hearing.

[[Page 364]]

                          Decisions and Appeals


<R05>
Sec. 142.30  How is the case decided?

    (a) The ALJ will issue an initial decision based only on the record. 
It will contain findings of fact, conclusions of law, and the amount of 
any penalties and assessments imposed.
    (b) The ALJ will serve the initial decision on all parties within 90 
days after close of the hearing or expiration of any allowed time for 
submission of post-hearing briefs. If the ALJ fails to meet this 
deadline, he or she shall promptly notify the parties of the reason for 
the delay and set a new deadline.
    (c) The findings of fact must include a finding on each of the 
following issues:
    (1) Whether any one or more of the claims or statements identified 
in the complaint violate this part; and
    (2) If the defendant is liable for penalties or assessments, the 
appropriate amount of any such penalties or assessments, considering any 
mitigating or aggravating factors.
    (d) The initial decision will include a description of the right of 
a defendant found liable for a civil penalty or assessment to file a 
motion for reconsideration with the ALJ or a notice of appeal with the 
Administrator.


<R05>
Sec. 142.31  Can a party request reconsideration of the initial decision?

    (a) Any party may file a motion for reconsideration of the initial 
decision with the ALJ within 20 days of receipt of the initial decision. 
If the initial decision was served by mail, there is a rebuttable 
presumption that the initial decision was received by the party 5 days 
from the date of mailing.
    (b) A motion for reconsideration must be accompanied by a supporting 
brief and must describe specifically each allegedly erroneous decision.
    (c) Any response to a motion for reconsideration must be filed 
within 20 days of receipt of such motion.
    (d) The ALJ will dispose of a motion for reconsideration by denying 
it or by issuing a revised initial decision.
    (e) If the ALJ issues a revised initial decision upon motion of a 
party, that party may not file another motion for reconsideration.


<R05>
Sec. 142.32  When does the initial decision of the ALJ become final?

    (a) The initial decision of the ALJ becomes the final decision of 
SBA, and shall be binding on all parties 30 days after it is issued, 
unless any party timely files a motion for reconsideration or any 
defendant adjudged to have submitted a false claim or statement timely 
appeals to the SBA Administrator, as set forth in Sec. 142.33.
    (b) If the ALJ disposes of a motion for reconsideration by denying 
it or by issuing a revised initial decision, the ALJ's order on the 
motion for reconsideration becomes the final decision of SBA 30 days 
after the order is issued, unless a defendant adjudged to have submitted 
a false claim or statement timely appeals to the Administrator, within 
30 days of the ALJ's order, as set forth in Sec. 142.33.


<R05>
Sec. 142.33  What are the procedures for appealing the ALJ decision?

    (a) Any defendant who submits a timely answer and is found liable 
for a civil penalty or assessment in an initial decision may appeal the 
decision.
    (b) The defendant may file a notice of appeal with the Administrator 
within 30 days following issuance of the initial decision, serving a 
copy of the notice of appeal on all parties and the ALJ. The 
Administrator may extend this deadline for up to thirty additional days 
if an extension request is filed within the initial 30 day period and 
shows good cause.
    (c) The defendant's appeal will not be considered until all timely 
motions for reconsideration have been resolved.
    (d) If a timely motion for reconsideration is denied, a notice of 
appeal may be filed within 30 days following such denial or issuance of 
a revised initial decision, whichever applies.
    (e) A notice of appeal must be supported by a written brief 
specifying why the initial decision should be reversed or modified.
    (f) SBA's representative may file a brief in opposition to the 
notice of appeal within 30 days of receiving the defendant's notice of 
appeal and supporting brief.
    (g) If a defendant timely files a notice of appeal, and the time for 
filing

[[Page 365]]

motions for reconsideration has expired, the ALJ will forward the record 
of the proceeding to the Administrator.


<R05>
Sec. 142.34  Are there any limitations on the right to appeal to the Administrator?

    (a) A defendant has no right to appear personally, or through a 
representative, before the Administrator.
    (b) There is no right to appeal any interlocutory ruling.
    (c) The Administrator will not consider any objection or evidence 
that was not raised before the ALJ unless the defendant demonstrates 
that the failure to object was caused by extraordinary circumstances. If 
the appealing defendant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the 
Administrator that extraordinary circumstances prevented the 
presentation of evidence at the hearing, and that the additional 
evidence is material, the Administrator may remand the matter to the ALJ 
for consideration of the additional evidence.


<R05>
Sec. 142.35  How does the Administrator dispose of an appeal?

    (a) The Administrator may affirm, reduce, reverse, compromise, 
remand, or settle any penalty or assessment imposed by the ALJ in the 
initial decision or reconsideration decision.
    (b) The Administrator will promptly serve each party to the appeal 
and the ALJ with a copy of his or her decision. This decision must 
contain a statement describing the right of any person, against whom a 
penalty or assessment has been made, to seek judicial review.


<R05>
Sec. 142.36  Can I obtain judicial review?

    If the initial decision is appealed, the decision of the 
Administrator is the final decision of SBA and is not subject to 
judicial review unless the defendant files a petition for judicial 
review within 60 days after the Administrator serves the defendant with 
a copy of the final decision.


<R05>
Sec. 142.37  What judicial review is available?

    31 U.S.C. 3805 authorizes judicial review by the appropriate United 
States District Court of any final SBA decision imposing penalties or 
assessments, and specifies the procedures for such review. To obtain 
judicial review, a defendant must file a petition in a timely fashion.


<R05>
Sec. 142.38  Can the administrative complaint be settled voluntarily?

    (a) Parties may make offers of compromise or settlement at any time. 
Any compromise or settlement must be in writing.
    (b) The reviewing official has the exclusive authority to compromise 
or settle the case from the date on which the reviewing official is 
permitted to issue a complaint until the ALJ issues an initial decision.
    (c) The Administrator has exclusive authority to compromise or 
settle the case from the date of the ALJ's initial decision until 
initiation of any judicial review or any action to collect the penalties 
and assessments.
    (d) The Attorney General has exclusive authority to compromise or 
settle the case while any judicial review or any action to recover 
penalties and assessments is pending.
    (e) The investigating official may recommend settlement terms to the 
reviewing official, the Administrator, or the Attorney General, as 
appropriate. The reviewing official may recommend settlement terms to 
the Administrator or the Attorney General, as appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 142.39  How are civil penalties and assessments collected?

    31 U.S.C. 3806 and 3808(b) authorize the Attorney General to bring 
specific actions for collection of such civil penalties and assessments 
including administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716. The penalties and 
assessments may not, however, be administratively offset against an 
overpayment of federal taxes (then or later owed) to the defendant by 
the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 142.40  What if the investigation indicates criminal misconduct?

    (a) Any investigating official may:
    (1) Refer allegations of criminal misconduct directly to the 
Department of Justice for prosecution or for suit under the False Claims 
Act or other civil proceeding;

[[Page 366]]

    (2) Defer or postpone a report or referral to the reviewing official 
to avoid interference with a criminal investigation or prosecution; or
    (3) Issue subpoenas under other statutory authority.

    (b) Nothing in this part limits the requirement that SBA employees 
report suspected violations of criminal law to the SBA Office of 
Inspector General or to the Attorney General.


<R05>
Sec. 142.41  How does SBA protect the rights of defendants?

    These procedures separate the functions of the investigating 
official, reviewing official, and the ALJ, each of whom report to a 
separate organizational authority in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3801. 
Except for purposes of settlement, or as a witness or a representative 
in public proceedings, no investigating official, reviewing official, or 
SBA employee or agent who helps investigate, prepare, or present a case 
may (in such case, or a factually related case) participate in the 
initial decision or the review of the initial decision by the 
Administrator. This separation of functions and organization is designed 
to assure the independence and impartiality of each government official 
during every stage of the proceeding. The representative for SBA may be 
employed in the offices of either the investigating official or the 
reviewing official.

Sec. 143.3  Definitions.

    As used in this part:
    Accrued expenditures mean the charges incurred by the grantee during 
a given period requiring the provision of funds for: (1) Goods and other 
tangible property received; (2) services performed by employees, 
contractors, subgrantees, subcontractors, and other payees; and (3) 
other amounts becoming owed under programs for which no current services 
or performance is required, such as annuities, insurance claims, and 
other benefit payments.
    Accrued income means the sum of: (1) Earnings during a given period 
from services performed by the grantee and goods and other tangible 
property delivered to purchasers, and (2) amounts becoming owed to the 
grantee for which no current services or performance is required by the 
grantee.
    Acquisition cost of an item of purchased equipment means the net 
invoice unit price of the property including the cost of modifications, 
attachments, accessories, or auxiliary apparatus necessary to make the 
property usable for the purpose for which it was acquired. Other charges 
such as the cost of installation, transportation, taxes, duty or 
protective in-transit insurance, shall be included or excluded from the 
unit acquisition cost in accordance with the grantee's regular 
accounting practices.
    Administrative requirements mean those matters common to grants in 
general, such as financial management, kinds and frequency of reports, 
and retention of records. These are distinguished from programmatic 
requirements, which concern matters that can be treated only on a 
program-by-program or grant-by-grant basis, such as kinds of activities 
that can be supported by grants under a particular program.
    Awarding agency means (1) with respect to a grant, the Federal 
agency, and (2) with respect to a subgrant, the party that awarded the 
subgrant.
    Cash contributions means the grantee's cash outlay, including the 
outlay of money contributed to the grantee or subgrantee by other public 
agencies and institutions, and private organizations and individuals. 
When authorized by Federal legislation, Federal funds received from 
other assistance agreements may be considered as grantee or subgrantee 
cash contributions.
    Contract means (except as used in the definitions for grant and 
subgrant in this section and except where qualified by Federal) a 
procurement contract under a grant or subgrant, and means a procurement 
subcontract under a contract.
    Cost sharing or matching means the value of the third party in-kind 
contributions and the portion of the costs of a federally assisted 
project or program not borne by the Federal Government.
    Cost-type contract means a contract or subcontract under a grant in 
which the contractor or subcontractor is paid on the basis of the costs 
it incurs, with or without a fee.
    Equipment means tangible, nonexpendable, personal property having a 
useful life of more than one year and an acquisition cost of $5,000 or 
more per unit. A grantee may use its own definition of equipment 
provided that such definition would at least include all equipment 
defined above.
    Expenditure report means: (1) For nonconstruction grants, the SF-269 
``Financial Status Report'' (or other equivalent report); (2) for 
construction grants, the SF-271 ``Outlay Report and Request for 
Reimbursement'' (or other equivalent report).
    Federally recognized Indian tribal government means the governing 
body or a governmental agency of any Indian tribe, band, nation, or 
other organized group or community (including any Native village as 
defined in section 3 of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, 85 Stat 
688) certified by the Secretary of the Interior as eligible for the 
special programs and services provided by him through the Bureau of 
Indian Affairs.
    Government means a State or local government or a federally 
recognized Indian tribal government.
    Grant means an award of financial assistance, including cooperative 
agreements, in the form of money, or property in lieu of money, by the 
Federal Government to an eligible grantee. The term does not include 
technical assistance which provides services instead of money, or other 
assistance in the form

[[Page 368]]

of revenue sharing, loans, loan guarantees, interest subsidies, 
insurance, or direct appropriations. Also, the term does not include 
assistance, such as a fellowship or other lump sum award, which the 
grantee is not required to account for.
    Grantee means the government to which a grant is awarded and which 
is accountable for the use of the funds provided. The grantee is the 
entire legal entity even if only a particular component of the entity is 
designated in the grant award document.
    Local government means a county, municipality, city, town, township, 
local public authority (including any public and Indian housing agency 
under the United States Housing Act of 1937) school district, special 
district, intrastate district, council of governments (whether or not 
incorporated as a nonprofit corporation under state law), any other 
regional or interstate government entity, or any agency or 
instrumentality of a local government.
    Obligations means the amounts of orders placed, contracts and 
subgrants awarded, goods and services received, and similar transactions 
during a given period that will require payment by the grantee during 
the same or a future period.
    OMB means the United States Office of Management and Budget.
    Outlays (expenditures) mean charges made to the project or program. 
They may be reported on a cash or accrual basis. For reports prepared on 
a cash basis, outlays are the sum of actual cash disbursement for direct 
charges for goods and services, the amount of indirect expense incurred, 
the value of in-kind contributions applied, and the amount of cash 
advances and payments made to contractors and subgrantees. For reports 
prepared on an accrued expenditure basis, outlays are the sum of actual 
cash disbursements, the amount of indirect expense incurred, the value 
of inkind contributions applied, and the new increase (or decrease) in 
the amounts owed by the grantee for goods and other property received, 
for services performed by employees, contractors, subgrantees, 
subcontractors, and other payees, and other amounts becoming owed under 
programs for which no current services or performance are required, such 
as annuities, insurance claims, and other benefit payments.
    Percentage of completion method refers to a system under which 
payments are made for construction work according to the percentage of 
completion of the work, rather than to the grantee's cost incurred.
    Prior approval means documentation evidencing consent prior to 
incurring specific cost.
    Real property means land, including land improvements, structures 
and appurtenances thereto, excluding movable machinery and equipment.
    Share, when referring to the awarding agency's portion of real 
property, equipment or supplies, means the same percentage as the 
awarding agency's portion of the acquiring party's total costs under the 
grant to which the acquisition costs under the grant to which the 
acquisition cost of the property was charged. Only costs are to be 
counted--not the value of third-party in-kind contributions.
    State means any of the several States of the United States, the 
District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, any territory or 
possession of the United States, or any agency or instrumentality of a 
State exclusive of local governments. The term does not include any 
public and Indian housing agency under United States Housing Act of 
1937.
    Subgrant means an award of financial assistance in the form of 
money, or property in lieu of money, made under a grant by a grantee to 
an eligible subgrantee. The term includes financial assistance when 
provided by contractual legal agreement, but does not include 
procurement purchases, nor does it include any form of assistance which 
is excluded from the definition of grant in this part.
    Subgrantee means the government or other legal entity to which a 
subgrant is awarded and which is accountable to the grantee for the use 
of the funds provided.
    Supplies means all tangible personal property other than equipment 
as defined in this part.
    Suspension means depending on the context, either (1) temporary 
withdrawal of the authority to obligate grant funds pending corrective 
action

[[Page 369]]

by the grantee or subgrantee or a decision to terminate the grant, or 
(2) an action taken by a suspending official in accordance with agency 
regulations implementing E.O. 12549 to immediately exclude a person from 
participating in grant transactions for a period, pending completion of 
an investigation and such legal or debarment proceedings as may ensue.
    Termination means permanent withdrawal of the authority to obligate 
previously-awarded grant funds before that authority would otherwise 
expire. It also means the voluntary relinquishment of that authority by 
the grantee or subgrantee. Termination does not include: (1) Withdrawal 
of funds awarded on the basis of the grantee's underestimate of the 
unobligated balance in a prior period; (2) Withdrawal of the unobligated 
balance as of the expiration of a grant; (3) Refusal to extend a grant 
or award additional funds, to make a competing or noncompeting 
continuation, renewal, extension, or supplemental award; or (4) voiding 
of a grant upon determination that the award was obtained fraudulently, 
or was otherwise illegal or invalid from inception.
    Terms of a grant or subgrant mean all requirements of the grant or 
subgrant, whether in statute, regulations, or the award document.
    Third party in-kind contributions mean property or services which 
benefit a federally assisted project or program and which are 
contributed by non-Federal third parties without charge to the grantee, 
or a cost-type contractor under the grant agreement.
    Unliquidated obligations for reports prepared on a cash basis mean 
the amount of obligations incurred by the grantee that has not been 
paid. For reports prepared on an accrued expenditure basis, they 
represent the amount of obligations incurred by the grantee for which an 
outlay has not been recorded.
    Unobligated balance means the portion of the funds authorized by the 
Federal agency that has not been obligated by the grantee and is 
determined by deducting the cumulative obligations from the cumulative 
funds authorized.

<R04>
                    Subpart B--Pre-Award Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 143.10  Forms for applying for grants.

    (a) Scope. (1) This section prescribes forms and instructions to be 
used by governmental organizations (except hospitals and institutions of 
higher education operated by a government) in applying for grants. This 
section is not applicable, however, to formula grant programs which do 
not require applicants to apply for funds on a project basis.
    (2) This section applies only to applications to Federal agencies 
for grants, and is not required to be applied by grantees in dealing 
with applicants for subgrants. However, grantees are encouraged to avoid 
more detailed or burdensome application requirements for subgrants.
    (b) Authorized forms and instructions for governmental 
organizations. (1) In applying for grants, applicants shall only use 
standard application forms or those prescribed by the granting agency 
with the approval of OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.
    (2) Applicants are not required to submit more than the original and 
two copies of preapplications or applications.
    (3) Applicants must follow all applicable instructions that bear OMB 
clearance numbers. Federal agencies may specify and describe the 
programs, functions, or activities that will be used to plan, budget, 
and evaluate the work under a grant. Other supplementary instructions 
may be issued only with the approval of OMB to the

[[Page 371]]

extent required under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. For any 
standard form, except the SF-424 facesheet, Federal agencies may shade 
out or instruct the applicant to disregard any line item that is not 
needed.
    (4) When a grantee applies for additional funding (such as a 
continuation or supplemental award) or amends a previously submitted 
application, only the affected pages need be submitted. Previously 
submitted pages with information that is still current need not be 
resubmitted.


<R05>
Sec. 143.11  State plans.

    (a) Scope. The statutes for some programs require States to submit 
plans before receiving grants. Under regulations implementing Executive 
Order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs,'' States 
are allowed to simplify, consolidate and substitute plans. This section 
contains additional provisions for plans that are subject to regulations 
implementing the Executive order.
    (b) Requirements. A State need meet only Federal administrative or 
programmatic requirements for a plan that are in statutes or codified 
regulations.
    (c) Assurances. In each plan the State will include an assurance 
that the State shall comply with all applicable Federal statutes and 
regulations in effect with respect to the periods for which it receives 
grant funding. For this assurance and other assurances required in the 
plan, the State may:
    (1) Cite by number the statutory or regulatory provisions requiring 
the assurances and affirm that it gives the assurances required by those 
provisions,
    (2) Repeat the assurance language in the statutes or regulations, or
    (3) Develop its own language to the extent permitted by law.
    (d) Amendments. A State will amend a plan whenever necessary to 
reflect: (1) New or revised Federal statutes or regulations or (2) a 
material change in any State law, organization, policy, or State agency 
operation. The State will obtain approval for the amendment and its 
effective date but need submit for approval only the amended portions of 
the plan.


<R05>
Sec. 143.12  Special grant or subgrant conditions for ``high-risk'' grantees.

    (a) A grantee or subgrantee may be considered high risk if an 
awarding agency determines that a grantee or subgrantee:
    (1) Has a history of unsatisfactory performance, or
    (2) Is not financially stable, or
    (3) Has a management system which does not meet the management 
standards set forth in this part, or
    (4) Has not conformed to terms and conditions of previous awards, or
    (5) Is otherwise not responsible; and if the awarding agency 
determines that an award will be made, special conditions and/or 
restrictions shall correspond to the high risk condition and shall be 
included in the award.
    (b) Special conditions or restrictions may include:
    (1) Payment on a reimbursement basis;
    (2) Withholding authority to proceed to the next phase until receipt 
of evidence of acceptable performance within a given funding period;
    (3) Requiring additional, more detailed financial reports;
    (4) Additional project monitoring;
    (5) Requiring the grante or subgrantee to obtain technical or 
management assistance; or
    (6) Establishing additional prior approvals.
    (c) If an awarding agency decides to impose such conditions, the 
awarding official will notify the grantee or subgrantee as early as 
possible, in writing, of:
    (1) The nature of the special conditions/restrictions;
    (2) The reason(s) for imposing them;
    (3) The corrective actions which must be taken before they will be 
removed and the time allowed for completing the corrective actions and
    (4) The method of requesting reconsideration of the conditions/
restrictions imposed.

<R04>
                   Subpart C--Post-Award Requirements

                        Financial Administration


<R05>
Sec. 143.20  Standards for financial management systems.

    (a) A State must expand and account for grant funds in accordance 
with State laws and procedures for expending and accounting for its own 
funds. Fiscal control and accounting procedures of the State, as well as 
its subgrantees and cost-type contractors, must be sufficient to--
    (1) Permit preparation of reports required by this part and the 
statutes authorizing the grant, and
    (2) Permit the tracing of funds to a level of expenditures adequate 
to establish that such funds have not been used in violation of the 
restrictions and prohibitions of applicable statutes.
    (b) The financial management systems of other grantees and 
subgrantees must meet the following standards:
    (1) Financial reporting. Accurate, current, and complete disclosure 
of the financial results of financially assisted activities must be made 
in accordance with the financial reporting requirements of the grant or 
subgrant.
    (2) Accounting records. Grantees and subgrantees must maintain 
records which adequately identify the source and application of funds 
provided for financially-assisted activities. These records must contain 
information pertaining to grant or subgrant awards and authorizations, 
obligations, unobligated balances, assets, liabilities, outlays or 
expenditures, and income.
    (3) Internal control. Effective control and accountability must be 
maintained for all grant and subgrant cash, real and personal property, 
and other assets. Grantees and subgrantees must adequately safeguard all 
such property and must assure that it is used solely for authorized 
purposes.
    (4) Budget control. Actual expenditures or outlays must be compared 
with budgeted amounts for each grant or subgrant. Financial information 
must be related to performance or productivity data, including the 
development of unit cost information whenever appropriate or 
specifically required in the grant or subgrant agreement. If unit cost 
data are required, estimates based on available documentation will be 
accepted whenever possible.
    (5) Allowable cost. Applicable OMB cost principles, agency program 
regulations, and the terms of grant and subgrant agreements will be 
followed in determining the reasonableness, allowability, and 
allocability of costs.
    (6) Source documentation. Accounting records must be supported by 
such source documentation as cancelled checks, paid bills, payrolls, 
time and attendance records, contract and subgrant award documents, etc.
    (7) Cash management. Procedures for minimizing the time elapsing 
between the transfer of funds from the U.S. Treasury and disbursement by 
grantees and subgrantees must be followed whenever advance payment 
procedures are used. Grantees must establish reasonable procedures to 
ensure the receipt of reports on subgrantees' cash balances and cash 
disbursements in sufficient time to enable them to prepare complete and 
accurate cash transactions reports to the awarding agency. When advances 
are made by letter-of-credit or electronic transfer of funds methods, 
the grantee must make drawdowns as close as possible to the time of 
making disbursements. Grantees must monitor cash drawdowns by their 
subgrantees to assure that they conform substantially to the same 
standards of timing and amount as apply to advances to the grantees.
    (c) An awarding agency may review the adequacy of the financial 
management system of any applicant for financial assistance as part of a 
preaward review or at any time subsequent to award.


<R05>
Sec. 143.21  Payment.

    (a) Scope. This section prescribes the basic standard and the 
methods under which a Federal agency will make payments to grantees, and 
grantees will make payments to subgrantees and contractors.
    (b) Basic standard. Methods and procedures for payment shall 
minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and 
disbursement by the grantee or subgrantee, in accordance

[[Page 373]]

with Treasury regulations at 31 CFR part 205.
    (c) Advances. Grantees and subgrantees shall be paid in advance, 
provided they maintain or demonstrate the willingness and ability to 
maintain procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the transfer 
of the funds and their disbursement by the grantee or subgrantee.
    (d) Reimbursement. Reimbursement shall be the preferred method when 
the requirements in paragraph (c) of this section are not met. Grantees 
and subgrantees may also be paid by reimbursement for any construction 
grant. Except as otherwise specified in regulation, Federal agencies 
shall not use the percentage of completion method to pay construction 
grants. The grantee or subgrantee may use that method to pay its 
construction contractor, and if it does, the awarding agency's payments 
to the grantee or subgrantee will be based on the grantee's or 
subgrantee's actual rate of disbursement.
    (e) Working capital advances. If a grantee cannot meet the criteria 
for advance payments described in paragraph (c) of this section, and the 
Federal agency has determined that reimbursement is not feasible because 
the grantee lacks sufficient working capital, the awarding agency may 
provide cash or a working capital advance basis. Under this procedure 
the awarding agency shall advance cash to the grantee to cover its 
estimated disbursement needs for an initial period generally geared to 
the grantee's disbursing cycle. Thereafter, the awarding agency shall 
reimburse the grantee for its actual cash disbursements. The working 
capital advance method of payment shall not be used by grantees or 
subgrantees if the reason for using such method is the unwillingness or 
inability of the grantee to provide timely advances to the subgrantee to 
meet the subgrantee's actual cash disbursements.
    (f) Effect of program income, refunds, and audit recoveries on 
payment. (1) Grantees and subgrantees shall disburse repayments to and 
interest earned on a revolving fund before requesting additional cash 
payments for the same activity.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, grantees 
and subgrantees shall disburse program income, rebates, refunds, 
contract settlements, audit recoveries and interest earned on such funds 
before requesting additional cash payments.
    (g) Withholding payments. (1) Unless otherwise required by Federal 
statute, awarding agencies shall not withhold payments for proper 
charges incurred by grantees or subgrantees unless--
    (i) The grantee or subgrantee has failed to comply with grant award 
conditions or
    (ii) The grantee or subgrantee is indebted to the United States.
    (2) Cash withheld for failure to comply with grant award condition, 
but without suspension of the grant, shall be released to the grantee 
upon subsequent compliance. When a grant is suspended, payment 
adjustments will be made in accordance with Sec. 143.43(c).
    (3) A Federal agency shall not make payment to grantees for amounts 
that are withheld by grantees or subgrantees from payment to contractors 
to assure satisfactory completion of work. Payments shall be made by the 
Federal agency when the grantees or subgrantees actually disburse the 
withheld funds to the contractors or to escrow accounts established to 
assure satisfactory completion of work.
    (h) Cash depositories. (1) Consistent with the national goal of 
expanding the opportunities for minority business enterprises, grantees 
and subgrantees are encouraged to use minority banks (a bank which is 
owned at least 50 percent by minority group members). A list of minority 
owned banks can be obtained from the Minority Business Development 
Agency, Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230.
    (2) A grantee or subgrantee shall maintain a separate bank account 
only when required by Federal-State agreement.
    (i) Interest earned on advances. Except for interest earned on 
advances of funds exempt under the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act (31 
U.S.C. 6501 et seq.) and the Indian Self-Determination Act (23 U.S.C. 
450), grantees and subgrantees shall promptly, but at least quarterly, 
remit interest earned on advances to the Federal agency. The

[[Page 374]]

grantee or subgrantee may keep interest amounts up to $100 per year for 
administrative expenses.


<R05>
Sec. 143.22  Allowable costs.

    (a) Limitation on use of funds. Grant funds may be used only for:
    (1) The allowable costs of the grantees, subgrantees and cost-type 
contractors, including allowable costs in the form of payments to fixed-
price contractors; and
    (2) Reasonable fees or profit to cost-type contractors but not any 
fee or profit (or other increment above allowable costs) to the grantee 
or subgrantee.
    (b) Applicable cost principles. For each kind of organization, there 
is a set of Federal principles for determining allowable costs. 
Allowable costs will be determined in accordance with the cost 
principles applicable to the organization incurring the costs. The 
following chart lists the kinds of organizations and the applicable cost 
principles.

                                             agency.
------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 143.23  Period of availability of funds.

    (a) General. Where a funding period is specified, a grantee may 
charge to the award only costs resulting from obligations of the funding 
period unless carryover of unobligated balances is permitted, in which 
case the carryover balances may be charged for costs resulting from 
obligations of the subsequent funding period.
    (b) Liquidation of obligations. A grantee must liquidate all 
obligations incurred under the award not later than 90 days after the 
end of the funding period (or as specified in a program regulation) to 
coincide with the submission of the annual Financial Status Report (SF-
269). The Federal agency may extend this deadline at the request of the 
grantee.


<R05>
Sec. 143.24  Matching or cost sharing.

    (a) Basic rule: Costs and contributions acceptable. With the 
qualifications and exceptions listed in paragraph (b) of this section, a 
matching or cost sharing requirement may be satisfied by either or both 
of the following:
    (1) Allowable costs incurred by the grantee, subgrantee or a cost-
type contractor under the assistance agreement. This includes allowable 
costs borne by non-Federal grants or by others cash donations from non-
Federal third parties.
    (2) The value of third party in-kind contributions applicable to the 
period to which the cost sharing or matching requirements applies.
    (b) Qualifications and exceptions--(1) Costs borne by other Federal 
grant agreements. Except as provided by Federal statute, a cost sharing 
or matching requirement may not be met by costs borne by another Federal 
grant. This prohibition does not apply to income earned by a grantee or 
subgrantee from a contract awarded under another Federal grant.
    (2) General revenue sharing. For the purpose of this section, 
general revenue sharing funds distributed under 31 U.S.C. 6702 are not 
considered Federal grant funds.
    (3) Cost or contributions counted towards other Federal costs-
sharing requirements. Neither costs nor the values of third party in-
kind contributions may count towards satisfying a cost sharing or 
matching requirement of a grant agreement if they have been or will be 
counted towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement of 
another Federal grant agreement, a Federal procurement contract, or any 
other award of Federal funds.
    (4) Costs financed by program income. Costs financed by program 
income, as defined in Sec. 143.25, shall not count towards satisfying a 
cost sharing or matching requirement unless they are expressly permitted 
in the terms of the assistance agreement. (This use of general program 
income is described in Sec. 143.25(g).)

[[Page 375]]

    (5) Services or property financed by income earned by contractors. 
Contractors under a grant may earn income from the activities carried 
out under the contract in addition to the amounts earned from the party 
awarding the contract. No costs of services or property supported by 
this income may count toward satisfying a cost sharing or matching 
requirement unless other provisions of the grant agreement expressly 
permit this kind of income to be used to meet the requirement.
    (6) Records. Costs and third party in-kind contributions counting 
towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement must be 
verifiable from the records of grantees and subgrantee or cost-type 
contractors. These records must show how the value placed on third party 
in-kind contributions was derived. To the extent feasible, volunteer 
services will be supported by the same methods that the organization 
uses to support the allocability of regular personnel costs.
    (7) Special standards for third party in-kind contributions. (i) 
Third party in-kind contributions count towards satisfying a cost 
sharing or matching requirement only where, if the party receiving the 
contributions were to pay for them, the payments would be allowable 
costs.
    (ii) Some third party in-kind contributions are goods and services 
that, if the grantee, subgrantee, or contractor receiving the 
contribution had to pay for them, the payments would have been an 
indirect costs. Costs sharing or matching credit for such contributions 
shall be given only if the grantee, subgrantee, or contractor has 
established, along with its regular indirect cost rate, a special rate 
for allocating to individual projects or programs the value of the 
contributions.
    (iii) A third party in-kind contribution to a fixed-price contract 
may count towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement only 
if it results in:
    (A) An increase in the services or property provided under the 
contract (without additional cost to the grantee or subgrantee) or
    (B) A cost savings to the grantee or subgrantee.
    (iv) The values placed on third party in-kind contributions for cost 
sharing or matching purposes will conform to the rules in the succeeding 
sections of this part. If a third party in-kind contribution is a type 
not treated in those sections, the value placed upon it shall be fair 
and reasonable.
    (c) Valuation of donated services--(1) Volunteer services. Unpaid 
services provided to a grantee or subgrantee by individuals will be 
valued at rates consistent with those ordinarily paid for similar work 
in the grantee's or subgrantee's organization. If the grantee or 
subgrantee does not have employees performing similar work, the rates 
will be consistent with those ordinarily paid by other employers for 
similar work in the same labor market. In either case, a reasonable 
amount for fringe benefits may be included in the valuation.
    (2) Employees of other organizations. When an employer other than a 
grantee, subgrantee, or cost-type contractor furnishes free of charge 
the services of an employee in the employee's normal line of work, the 
services will be valued at the employee's regular rate of pay exclusive 
of the employee's fringe benefits and overhead costs. If the services 
are in a different line of work, paragraph (c)(1) of this section 
applies.
    (d) Valuation of third party donated supplies and loaned equipment 
or space. (1) If a third party donates supplies, the contribution will 
be valued at the market value of the supplies at the time of donation.
    (2) If a third party donates the use of equipment or space in a 
building but retains title, the contribution will be valued at the fair 
rental rate of the equipment or space.
    (e) Valuation of third party donated equipment, buildings, and land. 
If a third party donates equipment, buildings, or land, and title passes 
to a grantee or subgrantee, the treatment of the donated property will 
depend upon the purpose of the grant or subgrant, as follows:
    (1) Awards for capital expenditures. If the purpose of the grant or 
subgrant is to assist the grantee or subgrantee in the acquisition of 
property, the market value of that property at the time of

[[Page 376]]

donation may be counted as cost sharing or matching,
    (2) Other awards. If assisting in the acquisition of property is not 
the purpose of the grant or subgrant, paragraphs (e)(2)(i) and (ii) of 
this section apply:
    (i) If approval is obtained from the awarding agency, the market 
value at the time of donation of the donated equipment or buildings and 
the fair rental rate of the donated land may be counted as cost sharing 
or matching. In the case of a subgrant, the terms of the grant agreement 
may require that the approval be obtained from the Federal agency as 
well as the grantee. In all cases, the approval may be given only if a 
purchase of the equipment or rental of the land would be approved as an 
allowable direct cost. If any part of the donated property was acquired 
with Federal funds, only the non-federal share of the property may be 
counted as cost-sharing or matching.
    (ii) If approval is not obtained under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this 
section, no amount may be counted for donated land, and only 
depreciation or use allowances may be counted for donated equipment and 
buildings. The depreciation or use allowances for this property are not 
treated as third party in-kind contributions. Instead, they are treated 
as costs incurred by the grantee or subgrantee. They are computed and 
allocated (usually as indirect costs) in accordance with the cost 
principles specified in Sec. 143.22, in the same way as depreciation or 
use allowances for purchased equipment and buildings. The amount of 
depreciation or use allowances for donated equipment and buildings is 
based on the property's market value at the time it was donated.
    (f) Valuation of grantee or subgrantee donated real property for 
construction/acquisition. If a grantee or subgrantee donates real 
property for a construction or facilities acquisition project, the 
current market value of that property may be counted as cost sharing or 
matching. If any part of the donated property was acquired with Federal 
funds, only the non-federal share of the property may be counted as cost 
sharing or matching.
    (g) Appraisal of real property. In some cases under paragraphs (d), 
(e) and (f) of this section, it will be necessary to establish the 
market value of land or a building or the fair rental rate of land or of 
space in a building. In these cases, the Federal agency may require the 
market value or fair rental value be set by an independent appraiser, 
and that the value or rate be certified by the grantee. This requirement 
will also be imposed by the grantee on subgrantees.


<R05>
Sec. 143.25  Program income.

    (a) General. Grantees are encouraged to earn income to defray 
program costs. Program income includes income from fees for services 
performed, from the use or rental of real or personal property acquired 
with grant funds, from the sale of commodities or items fabricated under 
a grant agreement, and from payments of principal and interest on loans 
made with grant funds. Except as otherwise provided in regulations of 
the Federal agency, program income does not include interest on grant 
funds, rebates, credits, discounts, refunds, etc. and interest earned on 
any of them.
    (b) Definition of program income. Program income means gross income 
received by the grantee or subgrantee directly generated by a grant 
supported activity, or earned only as a result of the grant agreement 
during the grant period. During the grant period is the time between the 
effective date of the award and the ending date of the award reflected 
in the final financial report.
    (c) Cost of generating program income. If authorized by Federal 
regulations or the grant agreement, costs incident to the generation of 
program income may be deducted from gross income to determine program 
income.
    (d) Governmental revenues. Taxes, special assessments, levies, 
fines, and other such revenues raised by a grantee or subgrantee are not 
program income unless the revenues are specifically identified in the 
grant agreement or Federal agency regulations as program income.
    (e) Royalties. Income from royalties and license fees for 
copyrighted material, patents, and inventions developed by a grantee or 
subgrantee is program income only if the revenues are specifically 
identified in the grant agreement

[[Page 377]]

or Federal agency regulations as program income. (See Sec. 143.34.)
    (f) Property. Proceeds from the sale of real property or equipment 
will be handled in accordance with the requirements of Secs. 143.31 and 
143.32.
    (g) Use of program income. Program income shall be deducted from 
outlays which may be both Federal and non-Federal as described below, 
unless the Federal agency regulations or the grant agreement specify 
another alternative (or a combination of the alternatives). In 
specifying alternatives, the Federal agency may distinguish between 
income earned by the grantee and income earned by subgrantees and 
between the sources, kinds, or amounts of income. When Federal agencies 
authorize the alternatives in paragraphs (g) (2) and (3) of this 
section, program income in excess of any limits stipulated shall also be 
deducted from outlays.
    (1) Deduction. Ordinarily program income shall be deducted from 
total allowable costs to determine the net allowable costs. Program 
income shall be used for current costs unless the Federal agency 
authorizes otherwise. Program income which the grantee did not 
anticipate at the time of the award shall be used to reduce the Federal 
agency and grantee contributions rather than to increase the funds 
committed to the project.
    (2) Addition. When authorized, program income may be added to the 
funds committed to the grant agreement by the Federal agency and the 
grantee. The program income shall be used for the purposes and under the 
conditions of the grant agreement.
    (3) Cost sharing or matching. When authorized, program income may be 
used to meet the cost sharing or matching requirement of the grant 
agreement. The amount of the Federal grant award remains the same.
    (h) Income after the award period. There are no Federal requirements 
governing the disposition of program income earned after the end of the 
award period (i.e., until the ending date of the final financial report, 
see paragraph (a) of this section), unless the terms of the agreement or 
the Federal agency regulations provide otherwise.


<R05>
Sec. 143.26  Non-Federal audit.

    (a) Basic Rule. Grantees and subgrantees are responsible for 
obtaining audits in accordance with the Single Audit Act Amendments of 
1996 (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507) and revised OMB Circular A-133, ``Audits of 
States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations.'' The audit 
shall be made by an independent auditor in accordance with generally 
accepted government auditing standards covering financial audits.
    (b) Subgrantees. State or local governments, as those terms are 
defined for purposes of the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996, that 
provide Federal awards to a subgrantee, which expends $300,000 or more 
(or other amount as specified by OMB) in Federal awards in a fiscal year 
shall:
    (1) Determine whether State or local subgrantees have met the audit 
requirements of the Act and whether subgrantees covered by OMB Circular 
A-110, ``Uniform Administrative Requirements with Institutions of Higher 
Education, Hospitals, and Other Non-Profit Organizations,'' have met the 
audit requirements of the Act. Commercial contractors (private for-
profit and private and governmental organizations) providing goods and 
services to State and local governments are not required to have a 
single audit performed. State and local governments should use their own 
procedures to ensure that the contractors has complied with laws and 
regulations affecting the expenditure of Federal funds;
    (2) Determine whether the subgrantee spent Federal assistance funds 
provided in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. This may be 
accomplished by reviewing an audit of the subgrantee made in accordance 
with the Act, Circular A-110, or through other means (e.g., program 
reviews) if the subgrantee has not had such an audit;
    (3) Ensure that appropriate corrective action is taken within six 
months after receipt of the audit report in instance of noncompliance 
with Federal laws and regulations;
    (4) Consider whether subgrantee audits necessitate adjustment of the 
grantee's own records; and

[[Page 378]]

    (5) Require each subgrantee to permit independent auditors to have 
access to the records and financial statements.
    (c) Auditor selection. In arranging for audit services, Sec. 143.36 
shall be followed.

[53 FR 8048, 8087, Mar. 11, 1988, as amended at 62 FR 45939, 45940, Aug. 
29, 1997]

                    Changes, Property, and Subawards


<R05>
Sec. 143.30  Changes.

    (a) General. Grantees and subgrantees are permitted to rebudget 
within the approved direct cost budget to meet unanticipated 
requirements and may make limited program changes to the approved 
project. However, unless waived by the awarding agency, certain types of 
post-award changes in budgets and projects shall require the prior 
written approval of the awarding agency.
    (b) Relation to cost principles. The applicable cost principles (see 
Sec. 143.22) contain requirements for prior approval of certain types of 
costs. Except where waived, those requirements apply to all grants and 
subgrants even if paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section do not.
    (c) Budget changes--(1) Nonconstruction projects. Except as stated 
in other regulations or an award document, grantees or subgrantees shall 
obtain the prior approval of the awarding agency whenever any of the 
following changes is anticipated under a nonconstruction award:
    (i) Any revision which would result in the need for additional 
funding.
    (ii) Unless waived by the awarding agency, cumulative transfers 
among direct cost categories, or, if applicable, among separately 
budgeted programs, projects, functions, or activities which exceed or 
are expected to exceed ten percent of the current total approved budget, 
whenever the awarding agency's share exceeds $100,000.
    (iii) Transfer of funds allotted for training allowances (i.e., from 
direct payments to trainees to other expense categories).
    (2) Construction projects. Grantees and subgrantees shall obtain 
prior written approval for any budget revision which would result in the 
need for additional funds.
    (3) Combined construction and nonconstruction projects. When a grant 
or subgrant provides funding for both construction and nonconstruction 
activities, the grantee or subgrantee must obtain prior written approval 
from the awarding agency before making any fund or budget transfer from 
nonconstruction to construction or vice versa.
    (d) Programmatic changes. Grantees or subgrantees must obtain the 
prior approval of the awarding agency whenever any of the following 
actions is anticipated:
    (1) Any revision of the scope or objectives of the project 
(regardless of whether there is an associated budget revision requiring 
prior approval).
    (2) Need to extend the period of availability of funds.
    (3) Changes in key persons in cases where specified in an 
application or a grant award. In research projects, a change in the 
project director or principal investigator shall always require approval 
unless waived by the awarding agency.
    (4) Under nonconstruction projects, contracting out, subgranting (if 
authorized by law) or otherwise obtaining the services of a third party 
to perform activities which are central to the purposes of the award. 
This approval requirement is in addition to the approval requirements of 
Sec. 143.36 but does not apply to the procurement of equipment, 
supplies, and general support services.
    (e) Additional prior approval requirements. The awarding agency may 
not require prior approval for any budget revision which is not 
described in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (f) Requesting prior approval. (1) A request for prior approval of 
any budget revision will be in the same budget formal the grantee used 
in its application and shall be accompanied by a narrative justification 
for the proposed revision.
    (2) A request for a prior approval under the applicable Federal cost 
principles (see Sec. 143.22) may be made by letter.
    (3) A request by a subgrantee for prior approval will be addressed 
in writing to the grantee. The grantee will promptly review such request 
and

[[Page 379]]

shall approve or disapprove the request in writing. A grantee will not 
approve any budget or project revision which is inconsistent with the 
purpose or terms and conditions of the Federal grant to the grantee. If 
the revision, requested by the subgrantee would result in a change to 
the grantee's approved project which requires Federal prior approval, 
the grantee will obtain the Federal agency's approval before approving 
the subgrantee's request.


<R05>
Sec. 143.31  Real property.

    (a) Title. Subject to the obligations and conditions set forth in 
this section, title to real property acquired under a grant or subgrant 
will vest upon acquisition in the grantee or subgrantee respectively.
    (b) Use. Except as otherwise provided by Federal statutes, real 
property will be used for the originally authorized purposes as long as 
needed for that purposes, and the grantee or subgrantee shall not 
dispose of or encumber its title or other interests.
    (c) Disposition. When real property is no longer needed for the 
originally authorized purpose, the grantee or subgrantee will request 
disposition instructions from the awarding agency. The instructions will 
provide for one of the following alternatives:
    (1) Retention of title. Retain title after compensating the awarding 
agency. The amount paid to the awarding agency will be computed by 
applying the awarding agency's percentage of participation in the cost 
of the original purchase to the fair market value of the property. 
However, in those situations where a grantee or subgrantee is disposing 
of real property acquired with grant funds and acquiring replacement 
real property under the same program, the net proceeds from the 
disposition may be used as an offset to the cost of the replacement 
property.
    (2) Sale of property. Sell the property and compensate the awarding 
agency. The amount due to the awarding agency will be calculated by 
applying the awarding agency's percentage of participation in the cost 
of the original purchase to the proceeds of the sale after deduction of 
any actual and reasonable selling and fixing-up expenses. If the grant 
is still active, the net proceeds from sale may be offset against the 
original cost of the property. When a grantee or subgrantee is directed 
to sell property, sales procedures shall be followed that provide for 
competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible 
return.
    (3) Transfer of title. Transfer title to the awarding agency or to a 
third-party designated/approved by the awarding agency. The grantee or 
subgrantee shall be paid an amount calculated by applying the grantee or 
subgrantee's percentage of participation in the purchase of the real 
property to the current fair market value of the property.


<R05>
Sec. 143.32  Equipment.

    (a) Title. Subject to the obligations and conditions set forth in 
this section, title to equipment acquired under a grant or subgrant will 
vest upon acquisition in the grantee or subgrantee respectively.
    (b) States. A State will use, manage, and dispose of equipment 
acquired under a grant by the State in accordance with State laws and 
procedures. Other grantees and subgrantees will follow paragraphs (c) 
through (e) of this section.
    (c) Use. (1) Equipment shall be used by the grantee or subgrantee in 
the program or project for which it was acquired as long as needed, 
whether or not the project or program continues to be supported by 
Federal funds. When no longer needed for the original program or 
project, the equipment may be used in other activities currently or 
previously supported by a Federal agency.
    (2) The grantee or subgrantee shall also make equipment available 
for use on other projects or programs currently or previously supported 
by the Federal Government, providing such use will not interfere with 
the work on the projects or program for which it was originally 
acquired. First preference for other use shall be given to other 
programs or projects supported by the awarding agency. User fees should 
be considered if appropriate.
    (3) Notwithstanding the encouragement in Sec. 143.25(a) to earn 
program income, the grantee or subgrantee must not use equipment 
acquired with grant

[[Page 380]]

funds to provide services for a fee to compete unfairly with private 
companies that provide equivalent services, unless specifically 
permitted or contemplated by Federal statute.
    (4) When acquiring replacement equipment, the grantee or subgrantee 
may use the equipment to be replaced as a trade-in or sell the property 
and use the proceeds to offset the cost of the replacement property, 
subject to the approval of the awarding agency.
    (d) Management requirements. Procedures for managing equipment 
(including replacement equipment), whether acquired in whole or in part 
with grant funds, until disposition takes place will, as a minimum, meet 
the following requirements:
    (1) Property records must be maintained that include a description 
of the property, a serial number or other identification number, the 
source of property, who holds title, the acquisition date, and cost of 
the property, percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the 
property, the location, use and condition of the property, and any 
ultimate disposition data including the date of disposal and sale price 
of the property.
    (2) A physical inventory of the property must be taken and the 
results reconciled with the property records at least once every two 
years.
    (3) A control system must be developed to ensure adequate safeguards 
to prevent loss, damage, or theft of the property. Any loss, damage, or 
theft shall be investigated.
    (4) Adequate maintenance procedures must be developed to keep the 
property in good condition.
    (5) If the grantee or subgrantee is authorized or required to sell 
the property, proper sales procedures must be established to ensure the 
highest possible return.
    (e) Disposition. When original or replacement equipment acquired 
under a grant or subgrant is no longer needed for the original project 
or program or for other activities currently or previously supported by 
a Federal agency, disposition of the equipment will be made as follows:
    (1) Items of equipment with a current per-unit fair market value of 
less than $5,000 may be retained, sold or otherwise disposed of with no 
further obligation to the awarding agency.
    (2) Items of equipment with a current per unit fair market value in 
excess of $5,000 may be retained or sold and the awarding agency shall 
have a right to an amount calculated by multiplying the current market 
value or proceeds from sale by the awarding agency's share of the 
equipment.
    (3) In cases where a grantee or subgrantee fails to take appropriate 
disposition actions, the awarding agency may direct the grantee or 
subgrantee to take excess and disposition actions.
    (f) Federal equipment. In the event a grantee or subgrantee is 
provided federally-owned equipment:
    (1) Title will remain vested in the Federal Government.
    (2) Grantees or subgrantees will manage the equipment in accordance 
with Federal agency rules and procedures, and submit an annual inventory 
listing.
    (3) When the equipment is no longer needed, the grantee or 
subgrantee will request disposition instructions from the Federal 
agency.
    (g) Right to transfer title. The Federal awarding agency may reserve 
the right to transfer title to the Federal Government or a third part 
named by the awarding agency when such a third party is otherwise 
eligible under existing statutes. Such transfers shall be subject to the 
following standards:
    (1) The property shall be identified in the grant or otherwise made 
known to the grantee in writing.
    (2) The Federal awarding agency shall issue disposition instruction 
within 120 calendar days after the end of the Federal support of the 
project for which it was acquired. If the Federal awarding agency fails 
to issue disposition instructions within the 120 calendar-day period the 
grantee shall follow Sec. 143.32(e).
    (3) When title to equipment is transferred, the grantee shall be 
paid an amount calculated by applying the percentage of participation in 
the purchase to the current fair market value of the property.


<R05>
Sec. 143.33  Supplies.

    (a) Title. Title to supplies acquired under a grant or subgrant will 
vest,

[[Page 381]]

upon acquisition, in the grantee or subgrantee respectively.
    (b) Disposition. If there is a residual inventory of unused supplies 
exceeding $5,000 in total aggregate fair market value upon termination 
or completion of the award, and if the supplies are not needed for any 
other federally sponsored programs or projects, the grantee or 
subgrantee shall compensate the awarding agency for its share.


<R05>
Sec. 143.34  Copyrights.

    The Federal awarding agency reserves a royalty-free, nonexclusive, 
and irrevocable license to reproduce, publish or otherwise use, and to 
authorize others to use, for Federal Government purposes:
    (a) The copyright in any work developed under a grant, subgrant, or 
contract under a grant or subgrant; and
    (b) Any rights of copyright to which a grantee, subgrantee or a 
contractor purchases ownership with grant support.


<R05>
Sec. 143.35  Subawards to debarred and suspended parties.

    Grantees and subgrantees must not make any award or permit any award 
(subgrant or contract) at any tier to any party which is debarred or 
suspended or is otherwise excluded from or ineligible for participation 
in Federal assistance programs under Executive Order 12549, ``Debarment 
and Suspension.''


<R05>
Sec. 143.36  Procurement.

    (a) States. When procuring property and services under a grant, a 
State will follow the same policies and procedures it uses for 
procurements from its non-Federal funds. The State will ensure that 
every purchase order or other contract includes any clauses required by 
Federal statutes and executive orders and their implementing 
regulations. Other grantees and subgrantees will follow paragraphs (b) 
through (i) in this section.
    (b) Procurement standards. (1) Grantees and subgrantees will use 
their own procurement procedures which reflect applicable State and 
local laws and regulations, provided that the procurements conform to 
applicable Federal law and the standards identified in this section.
    (2) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain a contract administration 
system which ensures that contractors perform in accordance with the 
terms, conditions, and specifications of their contracts or purchase 
orders.
    (3) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain a written code of 
standards of conduct governing the performance of their employees 
engaged in the award and administration of contracts. No employee, 
officer or agent of the grantee or subgrantee shall participate in 
selection, or in the award or administration of a contract supported by 
Federal funds if a conflict of interest, real or apparent, would be 
involved. Such a conflict would arise when:
    (i) The employee, officer or agent,
    (ii) Any member of his immediate family,
    (iii) His or her partner, or
    (iv) An organization which employs, or is about to employ, any of 
the above, has a financial or other interest in the firm selected for 
award. The grantee's or subgrantee's officers, employees or agents will 
neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors or anything of monetary 
value from contractors, potential contractors, or parties to 
subagreements. Grantee and subgrantees may set minimum rules where the 
financial interest is not substantial or the gift is an unsolicited item 
of nominal intrinsic value. To the extent permitted by State or local 
law or regulations, such standards or conduct will provide for 
penalties, sanctions, or other disciplinary actions for violations of 
such standards by the grantee's and subgrantee's officers, employees, or 
agents, or by contractors or their agents. The awarding agency may in 
regulation provide additional prohibitions relative to real, apparent, 
or potential conflicts of interest.
    (4) Grantee and subgrantee procedures will provide for a review of 
proposed procurements to avoid purchase of unnecessary or duplicative 
items. Consideration should be given to consolidating or breaking out 
procurements to obtain a more economical

[[Page 382]]

purchase. Where appropriate, an analysis will be made of lease versus 
purchase alternatives, and any other appropriate analysis to determine 
the most economical approach.
    (5) To foster greater economy and efficiency, grantees and 
subgrantees are encouraged to enter into State and local 
intergovernmental agreements for procurement or use of common goods and 
services.
    (6) Grantees and subgrantees are encouraged to use Federal excess 
and surplus property in lieu of purchasing new equipment and property 
whenever such use is feasible and reduces project costs.
    (7) Grantees and subgrantees are encouraged to use value engineering 
clauses in contracts for construction projects of sufficient size to 
offer reasonable opportunities for cost reductions. Value engineering is 
a systematic and creative anaylsis of each contract item or task to 
ensure that its essential function is provided at the overall lower 
cost.
    (8) Grantees and subgrantees will make awards only to responsible 
contractors possessing the ability to perform successfully under the 
terms and conditions of a proposed procurement. Consideration will be 
given to such matters as contractor integrity, compliance with public 
policy, record of past performance, and financial and technical 
resources.
    (9) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain records sufficient to 
detail the significant history of a procurement. These records will 
include, but are not necessarily limited to the following: rationale for 
the method of procurement, selection of contract type, contractor 
selection or rejection, and the basis for the contract price.
    (10) Grantees and subgrantees will use time and material type 
contracts only--
    (i) After a determination that no other contract is suitable, and
    (ii) If the contract includes a ceiling price that the contractor 
exceeds at its own risk.
    (11) Grantees and subgrantees alone will be responsible, in 
accordance with good administrative practice and sound business 
judgment, for the settlement of all contractual and administrative 
issues arising out of procurements. These issues include, but are not 
limited to source evaluation, protests, disputes, and claims. These 
standards do not relieve the grantee or subgrantee of any contractual 
responsibilities under its contracts. Federal agencies will not 
substitute their judgment for that of the grantee or subgrantee unless 
the matter is primarily a Federal concern. Violations of law will be 
referred to the local, State, or Federal authority having proper 
jurisdiction.
    (12) Grantees and subgrantees will have protest procedures to handle 
and resolve disputes relating to their procurements and shall in all 
instances disclose information regarding the protest to the awarding 
agency. A protestor must exhaust all administrative remedies with the 
grantee and subgrantee before pursuing a protest with the Federal 
agency. Reviews of protests by the Federal agency will be limited to:
    (i) Violations of Federal law or regulations and the standards of 
this section (violations of State or local law will be under the 
jurisdiction of State or local authorities) and
    (ii) Violations of the grantee's or subgrantee's protest procedures 
for failure to review a complaint or protest. Protests received by the 
Federal agency other than those specified above will be referred to the 
grantee or subgrantee.
    (c) Competition. (1) All procurement transactions will be conducted 
in a manner providing full and open competition consistent with the 
standards of Sec. 143.36. Some of the situations considered to be 
restrictive of competition include but are not limited to:
    (i) Placing unreasonable requirements on firms in order for them to 
qualify to do business,
    (ii) Requiring unnecessary experience and excessive bonding,
    (iii) Noncompetitive pricing practices between firms or between 
affiliated companies,
    (iv) Noncompetitive awards to consultants that are on retainer 
contracts,
    (v) Organizational conflicts of interest,
    (vi) Specifying only a brand name product instead of allowing an 
equal product to be offered and describing

[[Page 383]]

the performance of other relevant requirements of the procurement, and
    (vii) Any arbitrary action in the procurement process.
    (2) Grantees and subgrantees will conduct procurements in a manner 
that prohibits the use of statutorily or administratively imposed in-
State or local geographical preferences in the evaluation of bids or 
proposals, except in those cases where applicable Federal statutes 
expressly mandate or encourage geographic preference. Nothing in this 
section preempts State licensing laws. When contracting for 
architectural and engineering (A/E) services, geographic location may be 
a selection criteria provided its application leaves an appropriate 
number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project, to 
compete for the contract.
    (3) Grantees will have written selection procedures for procurement 
transactions. These procedures will ensure that all solicitations:
    (i) Incorporate a clear and accurate description of the technical 
requirements for the material, product, or service to be procured. Such 
description shall not, in competitive procurements, contain features 
which unduly restrict competition. The description may include a 
statement of the qualitative nature of the material, product or service 
to be procured, and when necessary, shall set forth those minimum 
essential characteristics and standards to which it must conform if it 
is to satisfy its intended use. Detailed product specifications should 
be avoided if at all possible. When it is impractical or uneconomical to 
make a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements, a 
brand name or equal description may be used as a means to define the 
performance or other salient requirements of a procurement. The specific 
features of the named brand which must be met by offerors shall be 
clearly stated; and
    (ii) Identify all requirements which the offerors must fulfill and 
all other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals.
    (4) Grantees and subgrantees will ensure that all prequalified lists 
of persons, firms, or products which are used in acquiring goods and 
services are current and include enough qualified sources to ensure 
maximum open and free competition. Also, grantees and subgrantees will 
not preclude potential bidders from qualifying during the solicitation 
period.
    (d) Methods of procurement to be followed. (1) Procurement by small 
purchase procedures. Small purchase procedures are those relatively 
simple and informal procurement methods for securing services, supplies, 
or other property that do not cost more than the simplified acquisition 
threshold fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403(11) (currently set at $100,000). If 
small purchase procedures are used, price or rate quotations shall be 
obtained from an adequate number of qualified sources.
    (2) Procurement by sealed bids (formal advertising). Bids are 
publicly solicited and a firm-fixed-price contract (lump sum or unit 
price) is awarded to the responsible bidder whose bid, conforming with 
all the material terms and conditions of the invitation for bids, is the 
lowest in price. The sealed bid method is the preferred method for 
procuring construction, if the conditions in Sec. 143.36(d)(2)(i) apply.
    (i) In order for sealed bidding to be feasible, the following 
conditions should be present:
    (A) A complete, adequate, and realistic specification or purchase 
description is available;
    (B) Two or more responsible bidders are willing and able to compete 
effectively and for the business; and
    (C) The procurement lends itself to a firm fixed price contract and 
the selection of the successful bidder can be made principally on the 
basis of price.
    (ii) If sealed bids are used, the following requirements apply:
    (A) The invitation for bids will be publicly advertised and bids 
shall be solicited from an adequate number of known suppliers, providing 
them sufficient time prior to the date set for opening the bids;
    (B) The invitation for bids, which will include any specifications 
and pertinent attachments, shall define the items or services in order 
for the bidder to properly respond;
    (C) All bids will be publicly opened at the time and place 
prescribed in the invitation for bids;

[[Page 384]]

    (D) A firm fixed-price contract award will be made in writing to the 
lowest responsive and responsible bidder. Where specified in bidding 
documents, factors such as discounts, transportation cost, and life 
cycle costs shall be considered in determining which bid is lowest. 
Payment discounts will only be used to determine the low bid when prior 
experience indicates that such discounts are usually taken advantage of; 
and
    (E) Any or all bids may be rejected if there is a sound documented 
reason.
    (3) Procurement by competitive proposals. The technique of 
competitive proposals is normally conducted with more than one source 
submitting an offer, and either a fixed-price or cost-reimbursement type 
contract is awarded. It is generally used when conditions are not 
appropriate for the use of sealed bids. If this method is used, the 
following requirements apply:
    (i) Requests for proposals will be publicized and identify all 
evaluation factors and their relative importance. Any response to 
publicized requests for proposals shall be honored to the maximum extent 
practical;
    (ii) Proposals will be solicited from an adequate number of 
qualified sources;
    (iii) Grantees and subgrantees will have a method for conducting 
technical evaluations of the proposals received and for selecting 
awardees;
    (iv) Awards will be made to the responsible firm whose proposal is 
most advantageous to the program, with price and other factors 
considered; and
    (v) Grantees and subgrantees may use competitive proposal procedures 
for qualifications-based procurement of architectural/engineering (A/E) 
professional services whereby competitors' qualifications are evaluated 
and the most qualified competitor is selected, subject to negotiation of 
fair and reasonable compensation. The method, where price is not used as 
a selection factor, can only be used in procurement of A/E professional 
services. It cannot be used to purchase other types of services though 
A/E firms are a potential source to perform the proposed effort.
    (4) Procurement by noncompetitive proposals is procurement through 
solicitation of a proposal from only one source, or after solicitation 
of a number of sources, competition is determined inadequate.
    (i) Procurement by noncompetitive proposals may be used only when 
the award of a contract is infeasible under small purchase procedures, 
sealed bids or competitive proposals and one of the following 
circumstances applies:
    (A) The item is available only from a single source;
    (B) The public exigency or emergency for the requirement will not 
permit a delay resulting from competitive solicitation;
    (C) The awarding agency authorizes noncompetitive proposals; or
    (D) After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is 
determined inadequate.
    (ii) Cost analysis, i.e., verifying the proposed cost data, the 
projections of the data, and the evaluation of the specific elements of 
costs and profits, is required.
    (iii) Grantees and subgrantees may be required to submit the 
proposed procurement to the awarding agency for pre-award review in 
accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.
    (e) Contracting with small and minority firms, women's business 
enterprise and labor surplus area firms. (1) The grantee and subgrantee 
will take all necessary affirmative steps to assure that minority firms, 
women's business enterprises, and labor surplus area firms are used when 
possible.
    (2) Affirmative steps shall include:
    (i) Placing qualified small and minority businesses and women's 
business enterprises on solicitation lists;
    (ii) Assuring that small and minority businesses, and women's 
business enterprises are solicited whenever they are potential sources;
    (iii) Dividing total requirements, when economically feasible, into 
smaller tasks or quantities to permit maximum participation by small and 
minority business, and women's business enterprises;
    (iv) Establishing delivery schedules, where the requirement permits, 
which encourage participation by small and minority business, and 
women's business enterprises;

[[Page 385]]

    (v) Using the services and assistance of the Small Business 
Administration, and the Minority Business Development Agency of the 
Department of Commerce; and
    (vi) Requiring the prime contractor, if subcontracts are to be let, 
to take the affirmative steps listed in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) through (v) 
of this section.
    (f) Contract cost and price. (1) Grantees and subgrantees must 
perform a cost or price analysis in connection with every procurement 
action including contract modifications. The method and degree of 
analysis is dependent on the facts surrounding the particular 
procurement situation, but as a starting point, grantees must make 
independent estimates before receiving bids or proposals. A cost 
analysis must be performed when the offeror is required to submit the 
elements of his estimated cost, e.g., under professional, consulting, 
and architectural engineering services contracts. A cost analysis will 
be necessary when adequate price competition is lacking, and for sole 
source procurements, including contract modifications or change orders, 
unless price resonableness can be established on the basis of a catalog 
or market price of a commercial product sold in substantial quantities 
to the general public or based on prices set by law or regulation. A 
price analysis will be used in all other instances to determine the 
reasonableness of the proposed contract price.
    (2) Grantees and subgrantees will negotiate profit as a separate 
element of the price for each contract in which there is no price 
competition and in all cases where cost analysis is performed. To 
establish a fair and reasonable profit, consideration will be given to 
the complexity of the work to be performed, the risk borne by the 
contractor, the contractor's investment, the amount of subcontracting, 
the quality of its record of past performance, and industry profit rates 
in the surrounding geographical area for similar work.
    (3) Costs or prices based on estimated costs for contracts under 
grants will be allowable only to the extent that costs incurred or cost 
estimates included in negotiated prices are consistent with Federal cost 
principles (see Sec. 143.22). Grantees may reference their own cost 
principles that comply with the applicable Federal cost principles.
    (4) The cost plus a percentage of cost and percentage of 
construction cost methods of contracting shall not be used.
    (g) Awarding agency review. (1) Grantees and subgrantees must make 
available, upon request of the awarding agency, technical specifications 
on proposed procurements where the awarding agency believes such review 
is needed to ensure that the item and/or service specified is the one 
being proposed for purchase. This review generally will take place prior 
to the time the specification is incorporated into a solicitation 
document. However, if the grantee or subgrantee desires to have the 
review accomplished after a solicitation has been developed, the 
awarding agency may still review the specifications, with such review 
usually limited to the technical aspects of the proposed purchase.
    (2) Grantees and subgrantees must on request make available for 
awarding agency pre-award review procurement documents, such as requests 
for proposals or invitations for bids, independent cost estimates, etc. 
when:
    (i) A grantee's or subgrantee's procurement procedures or operation 
fails to comply with the procurement standards in this section; or
    (ii) The procurement is expected to exceed the simplified 
acquisition threshold and is to be awarded without competition or only 
one bid or offer is received in response to a solicitation; or
    (iii) The procurement, which is expected to exceed the simplified 
acquisition threshold, specifies a ``brand name'' product; or
    (iv) The proposed award is more than the simplified acquisition 
threshold and is to be awarded to other than the apparent low bidder 
under a sealed bid procurement; or
    (v) A proposed contract modification changes the scope of a contract 
or increases the contract amount by more than the simplified acquisition 
threshold.
    (3) A grantee or subgrantee will be exempt from the pre-award review 
in paragraph (g)(2) of this section if the

[[Page 386]]

awarding agency determines that its procurement systems comply with the 
standards of this section.
    (i) A grantee or subgrantee may request that its procurement system 
be reviewed by the awarding agency to determine whether its system meets 
these standards in order for its system to be certified. Generally, 
these reviews shall occur where there is a continuous high-dollar 
funding, and third-party contracts are awarded on a regular basis.
    (ii) A grantee or subgrantee may self-certify its procurement 
system. Such self-certification shall not limit the awarding agency's 
right to survey the system. Under a self-certification procedure, 
awarding agencies may wish to rely on written assurances from the 
grantee or subgrantee that it is complying with these standards. A 
grantee or subgrantee will cite specific procedures, regulations, 
standards, etc., as being in compliance with these requirements and have 
its system available for review.
    (h) Bonding requirements. For construction or facility improvement 
contracts or subcontracts exceeding the simplified acquisition 
threshold, the awarding agency may accept the bonding policy and 
requirements of the grantee or subgrantee provided the awarding agency 
has made a determination that the awarding agency's interest is 
adequately protected. If such a determination has not been made, the 
minimum requirements shall be as follows:
    (1) A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of 
the bid price. The ``bid guarantee'' shall consist of a firm commitment 
such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument 
accompanying a bid as assurance that the bidder will, upon acceptance of 
his bid, execute such contractual documents as may be required within 
the time specified.
    (2) A performance bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent 
of the contract price. A ``performance bond'' is one executed in 
connection with a contract to secure fulfillment of all the contractor's 
obligations under such contract.
    (3) A payment bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of 
the contract price. A ``payment bond'' is one executed in connection 
with a contract to assure payment as required by law of all persons 
supplying labor and material in the execution of the work provided for 
in the contract.
    (i) Contract provisions. A grantee's and subgrantee's contracts must 
contain provisions in paragraph (i) of this section. Federal agencies 
are permitted to require changes, remedies, changed conditions, access 
and records retention, suspension of work, and other clauses approved by 
the Office of Federal Procurement Policy.
    (1) Administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances 
where contractors violate or breach contract terms, and provide for such 
sanctions and penalties as may be appropriate. (Contracts more than the 
simplified acquisition threshold)
    (2) Termination for cause and for convenience by the grantee or 
subgrantee including the manner by which it will be effected and the 
basis for settlement. (All contracts in excess of $10,000)
    (3) Compliance with Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, 
entitled ``Equal Employment Opportunity,'' as amended by Executive Order 
11375 of October 13, 1967, and as supplemented in Department of Labor 
regulations (41 CFR chapter 60). (All construction contracts awarded in 
excess of $10,000 by grantees and their contractors or subgrantees)
    (4) Compliance with the Copeland ``Anti-Kickback'' Act (18 U.S.C. 
874) as supplemented in Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR part 3). 
(All contracts and subgrants for construction or repair)
    (5) Compliance with the Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 276a to 276a-7) 
as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR part 5). 
(Construction contracts in excess of $2000 awarded by grantees and 
subgrantees when required by Federal grant program legislation)
    (6) Compliance with Sections 103 and 107 of the Contract Work Hours 
and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 327-330) as supplemented by 
Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR part 5). (Construction contracts 
awarded by grantees and subgrantees in excess of

[[Page 387]]

$2000, and in excess of $2500 for other contracts which involve the 
employment of mechanics or laborers)
    (7) Notice of awarding agency requirements and regulations 
pertaining to reporting.
    (8) Notice of awarding agency requirements and regulations 
pertaining to patent rights with respect to any discovery or invention 
which arises or is developed in the course of or under such contract.
    (9) Awarding agency requirements and regulations pertaining to 
copyrights and rights in data.
    (10) Access by the grantee, the subgrantee, the Federal grantor 
agency, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their 
duly authorized representatives to any books, documents, papers, and 
records of the contractor which are directly pertinent to that specific 
contract for the purpose of making audit, examination, excerpts, and 
transcriptions.
    (11) Retention of all required records for three years after 
grantees or subgrantees make final payments and all other pending 
matters are closed.
    (12) Compliance with all applicable standards, orders, or 
requirements issued under section 306 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 
1857(h)), section 508 of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1368), Executive 
Order 11738, and Environmental Protection Agency regulations (40 CFR 
part 15). (Contracts, subcontracts, and subgrants of amounts in excess 
of $100,000)
    (13) Mandatory standards and policies relating to energy efficiency 
which are contained in the state energy conservation plan issued in 
compliance with the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (Pub. L. 94-163, 
89 Stat. 871).

<R05>
Sec. 143.37  Subgrants.

    (a) States. States shall follow state law and procedures when 
awarding and administering subgrants (whether on a cost reimbursement or 
fixed amount basis) of financial assistance to local and Indian tribal 
governments. States shall:
    (1) Ensure that every subgrant includes any clauses required by 
Federal statute and executive orders and their implementing regulations;
    (2) Ensure that subgrantees are aware of requirements imposed upon 
them by Federal statute and regulation;
    (3) Ensure that a provision for compliance with Sec. 143.42 is 
placed in every cost reimbursement subgrant; and
    (4) Conform any advances of grant funds to subgrantees substantially 
to the same standards of timing and amount that apply to cash advances 
by Federal agencies.
    (b) All other grantees. All other grantees shall follow the 
provisions of this part which are applicable to awarding agencies when 
awarding and administering subgrants (whether on a cost reimbursement or 
fixed amount basis) of financial assistance to local and Indian tribal 
governments. Grantees shall:
    (1) Ensure that every subgrant includes a provision for compliance 
with this part;
    (2) Ensure that every subgrant includes any clauses required by 
Federal statute and executive orders and their implementing regulations; 
and
    (3) Ensure that subgrantees are aware of requirements imposed upon 
them by Federal statutes and regulations.
    (c) Exceptions. By their own terms, certain provisions of this part 
do not apply to the award and administration of subgrants:
    (1) Section 143.10;
    (2) Section 143.11;
    (3) The letter-of-credit procedures specified in Treasury 
Regulations at 31 CFR part 205, cited in Sec. 143.21; and
    (4) Section 143.50.

              Reports, Records, Retention, and Enforcement


<R05>
Sec. 143.40  Monitoring and reporting program performance.

    (a) Monitoring by grantees. Grantees are responsible for managing 
the day-to-day operations of grant and subgrant supported activities. 
Grantees must monitor grant and subgrant supported activities to assure 
compliance with applicable Federal requirements and that performance 
goals are being achieved. Grantee monitoring must

[[Page 388]]

cover each program, function or activity.
    (b) Nonconstruction performance reports. The Federal agency may, if 
it decides that performance information available from subsequent 
applications contains sufficient information to meet its programmatic 
needs, require the grantee to submit a performance report only upon 
expiration or termination of grant support. Unless waived by the Federal 
agency this report will be due on the same date as the final Financial 
Status Report.
    (1) Grantees shall submit annual performance reports unless the 
awarding agency requires quarterly or semi-annual reports. However, 
performance reports will not be required more frequently than quarterly. 
Annual reports shall be due 90 days after the grant year, quarterly or 
semi-annual reports shall be due 30 days after the reporting period. The 
final performance report will be due 90 days after the expiration or 
termination of grant support. If a justified request is submitted by a 
grantee, the Federal agency may extend the due date for any performance 
report. Additionally, requirements for unnecessary performance reports 
may be waived by the Federal agency.
    (2) Performance reports will contain, for each grant, brief 
information on the following:
    (i) A comparison of actual accomplishments to the objectives 
established for the period. Where the output of the project can be 
quantified, a computation of the cost per unit of output may be required 
if that information will be useful.
    (ii) The reasons for slippage if established objectives were not 
met.
    (iii) Additional pertinent information including, when appropriate, 
analysis and explanation of cost overruns or high unit costs.
    (3) Grantees will not be required to submit more than the original 
and two copies of performance reports.
    (4) Grantees will adhere to the standards in this section in 
prescribing performance reporting requirements for subgrantees.
    (c) Construction performance reports. For the most part, on-site 
technical inspections and certified percentage-of-completion data are 
relied on heavily by Federal agencies to monitor progress under 
construction grants and subgrants. The Federal agency will require 
additional formal performance reports only when considered necessary, 
and never more frequently than quarterly.
    (d) Significant developments. Events may occur between the scheduled 
performance reporting dates which have significant impact upon the grant 
or subgrant supported activity. In such cases, the grantee must inform 
the Federal agency as soon as the following types of conditions become 
known:
    (1) Problems, delays, or adverse conditions which will materially 
impair the ability to meet the objective of the award. This disclosure 
must include a statement of the action taken, or contemplated, and any 
assistance needed to resolve the situation.
    (2) Favorable developments which enable meeting time schedules and 
objectives sooner or at less cost than anticipated or producing more 
beneficial results than originally planned.
    (e) Federal agencies may make site visits as warranted by program 
needs.
    (f) Waivers, extensions. (1) Federal agencies may waive any 
performance report required by this part if not needed.
    (2) The grantee may waive any performance report from a subgrantee 
when not needed. The grantee may extend the due date for any performance 
report from a subgrantee if the grantee will still be able to meet its 
performance reporting obligations to the Federal agency.


<R05>
Sec. 143.41  Financial reporting.

    (a) General. (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (a) (2) and (5) of 
this section, grantees will use only the forms specified in paragraphs 
(a) through (e) of this section, and such supplementary or other forms 
as may from time to time be authorized by OMB, for:
    (i) Submitting financial reports to Federal agencies, or
    (ii) Requesting advances or reimbursements when letters of credit 
are not used.
    (2) Grantees need not apply the forms prescribed in this section in 
dealing with their subgrantees. However,

[[Page 389]]

grantees shall not impose more burdensome requirements on subgrantees.
    (3) Grantees shall follow all applicable standard and supplemental 
Federal agency instructions approved by OMB to the extend required under 
the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 for use in connection with forms 
specified in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section. Federal 
agencies may issue substantive supplementary instructions only with the 
approval of OMB. Federal agencies may shade out or instruct the grantee 
to disregard any line item that the Federal agency finds unnecessary for 
its decisionmaking purposes.
    (4) Grantees will not be required to submit more than the original 
and two copies of forms required under this part.
    (5) Federal agencies may provide computer outputs to grantees to 
expedite or contribute to the accuracy of reporting. Federal agencies 
may accept the required information from grantees in machine usable 
format or computer printouts instead of prescribed forms.
    (6) Federal agencies may waive any report required by this section 
if not needed.
    (7) Federal agencies may extend the due date of any financial report 
upon receiving a justified request from a grantee.
    (b) Financial Status Report--(1) Form. Grantees will use Standard 
Form 269 or 269A, Financial Status Report, to report the status of funds 
for all nonconstruction grants and for construction grants when required 
in accordance with Sec. 143.41(e)(2)(iii) of this section.
    (2) Accounting basis. Each grantee will report program outlays and 
program income on a cash or accrual basis as prescribed by the awarding 
agency. If the Federal agency requires accrual information and the 
grantee's accounting records are not normally kept on the accural basis, 
the grantee shall not be required to convert its accounting system but 
shall develop such accrual information through and analysis of the 
documentation on hand.
    (3) Frequency. The Federal agency may prescribe the frequency of the 
report for each project or program. However, the report will not be 
required more frequently than quarterly. If the Federal agency does not 
specify the frequency of the report, it will be submitted annually. A 
final report will be required upon expiration or termination of grant 
support.
    (4) Due date. When reports are required on a quarterly or semiannual 
basis, they will be due 30 days after the reporting period. When 
required on an annual basis, they will be due 90 days after the grant 
year. Final reports will be due 90 days after the expiration or 
termination of grant support.
    (c) Federal Cash Transactions Report--(1) Form. (i) For grants paid 
by letter or credit, Treasury check advances or electronic transfer of 
funds, the grantee will submit the Standard Form 272, Federal Cash 
Transactions Report, and when necessary, its continuation sheet, 
Standard Form 272a, unless the terms of the award exempt the grantee 
from this requirement.
    (ii) These reports will be used by the Federal agency to monitor 
cash advanced to grantees and to obtain disbursement or outlay 
information for each grant from grantees. The format of the report may 
be adapted as appropriate when reporting is to be accomplished with the 
assistance of automatic data processing equipment provided that the 
information to be submitted is not changed in substance.
    (2) Forecasts of Federal cash requirements. Forecasts of Federal 
cash requirements may be required in the Remarks section of the report.
    (3) Cash in hands of subgrantees. When considered necessary and 
feasible by the Federal agency, grantees may be required to report the 
amount of cash advances in excess of three days' needs in the hands of 
their subgrantees or contractors and to provide short narrative 
explanations of actions taken by the grantee to reduce the excess 
balances.
    (4) Frequency and due date. Grantees must submit the report no later 
than 15 working days following the end of each quarter. However, where 
an advance either by letter of credit or electronic transfer of funds is 
authorized at an annualized rate of one million dollars or more, the 
Federal agency may require the report to be submitted within 15 working 
days following the end of each month.

[[Page 390]]

    (d) Request for advance or reimbursement--(1) Advance payments. 
Requests for Treasury check advance payments will be submitted on 
Standard Form 270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement. (This form will 
not be used for drawdowns under a letter of credit, electronic funds 
transfer or when Treasury check advance payments are made to the grantee 
automatically on a predetermined basis.)
    (2) Reimbursements. Requests for reimbursement under nonconstruction 
grants will also be submitted on Standard Form 270. (For reimbursement 
requests under construction grants, see paragraph (e)(1) of this 
section.)
    (3) The frequency for submitting payment requests is treated in 
Sec. 143.41(b)(3).
    (e) Outlay report and request for reimbursement for construction 
programs. (1) Grants that support construction activities paid by 
reimbursement method.
    (i) Requests for reimbursement under construction grants will be 
submitted on Standard Form 271, Outlay Report and Request for 
Reimbursement for Construction Programs. Federal agencies may, however, 
prescribe the Request for Advance or Reimbursement form, specified in 
Sec. 143.41(d), instead of this form.
    (ii) The frequency for submitting reimbursement requests is treated 
in Sec. 143.41(b)(3).
    (2) Grants that support construction activities paid by letter of 
credit, electronic funds transfer or Treasury check advance.
    (i) When a construction grant is paid by letter of credit, 
electronic funds transfer or Treasury check advances, the grantee will 
report its outlays to the Federal agency using Standard Form 271, Outlay 
Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs. The 
Federal agency will provide any necessary special instruction. However, 
frequency and due date shall be governed by Sec. 143.41(b) (3) and (4).
    (ii) When a construction grant is paid by Treasury check advances 
based on periodic requests from the grantee, the advances will be 
requested on the form specified in Sec. 143.41(d).
    (iii) The Federal agency may substitute the Financial Status Report 
specified in Sec. 143.41(b) for the Outlay Report and Request for 
Reimbursement for Construction Programs.
    (3) Accounting basis. The accounting basis for the Outlay Report and 
Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs shall be governed by 
Sec. 143.41(b)(2).


<R05>
Sec. 143.42  Retention and access requirements for records.

    (a) Applicability. (1) This section applies to all financial and 
programmatic records, supporting documents, statistical records, and 
other records of grantees or subgrantees which are:
    (i) Required to be maintained by the terms of this part, program 
regulations or the grant agreement, or
    (ii) Otherwise reasonably considered as pertinent to program 
regulations or the grant agreement.
    (2) This section does not apply to records maintained by contractors 
or subcontractors. For a requirement to place a provision concerning 
records in certain kinds of contracts, see Sec. 143.36(i)(10).
    (b) Length of retention period. (1) Except as otherwise provided, 
records must be retained for three years from the starting date 
specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) If any litigation, claim, negotiation, audit or other action 
involving the records has been started before the expiration of the 3-
year period, the records must be retained until completion of the action 
and resolution of all issues which arise from it, or until the end of 
the regular 3-year period, whichever is later.
    (3) To avoid duplicate recordkeeping, awarding agencies may make 
special arrangements with grantees and subgrantees to retain any records 
which are continuously needed for joint use. The awarding agency will 
request transfer of records to its custody when it determines that the 
records possess long-term retention value. When the records are 
transferred to or maintained by the Federal agency, the 3-year retention 
requirement is not applicable to the grantee or subgrantee.
    (c) Starting date of retention period--(1) General. When grant 
support is continued or renewed at annual or other intervals, the 
retention period for the

[[Page 391]]

records of each funding period starts on the day the grantee or 
subgrantee submits to the awarding agency its single or last expenditure 
report for that period. However, if grant support is continued or 
renewed quarterly, the retention period for each year's records starts 
on the day the grantee submits its expenditure report for the last 
quarter of the Federal fiscal year. In all other cases, the retention 
period starts on the day the grantee submits its final expenditure 
report. If an expenditure report has been waived, the retention period 
starts on the day the report would have been due.
    (2) Real property and equipment records. The retention period for 
real property and equipment records starts from the date of the 
disposition or replacement or transfer at the direction of the awarding 
agency.
    (3) Records for income transactions after grant or subgrant support. 
In some cases grantees must report income after the period of grant 
support. Where there is such a requirement, the retention period for the 
records pertaining to the earning of the income starts from the end of 
the grantee's fiscal year in which the income is earned.
    (4) Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, etc. This 
paragraph applies to the following types of documents, and their 
supporting records: indirect cost rate computations or proposals, cost 
allocation plans, and any similar accounting computations of the rate at 
which a particular group of costs is chargeable (such as computer usage 
chargeback rates or composite fringe benefit rates).
    (i) If submitted for negotiation. If the proposal, plan, or other 
computation is required to be submitted to the Federal Government (or to 
the grantee) to form the basis for negotiation of the rate, then the 3-
year retention period for its supporting records starts from the date of 
such submission.
    (ii) If not submitted for negotiation. If the proposal, plan, or 
other computation is not required to be submitted to the Federal 
Government (or to the grantee) for negotiation purposes, then the 3-year 
retention period for the proposal plan, or computation and its 
supporting records starts from end of the fiscal year (or other 
accounting period) covered by the proposal, plan, or other computation.
    (d) Substitution of microfilm. Copies made by microfilming, 
photocopying, or similar methods may be substituted for the original 
records.
    (e) Access to records--(1) Records of grantees and subgrantees. The 
awarding agency and the Comptroller General of the United States, or any 
of their authorized representatives, shall have the right of access to 
any pertinent books, documents, papers, or other records of grantees and 
subgrantees which are pertinent to the grant, in order to make audits, 
examinations, excerpts, and transcripts.
    (2) Expiration of right of access. The rights of access in this 
section must not be limited to the required retention period but shall 
last as long as the records are retained.
    (f) Restrictions on public access. The Federal Freedom of 
Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) does not apply to records Unless required 
by Federal, State, or local law, grantees and subgrantees are not 
required to permit public access to their records.


<R05>
Sec. 143.43  Enforcement.

    (a) Remedies for noncompliance. If a grantee or subgrantee 
materially fails to comply with any term of an award, whether stated in 
a Federal statute or regulation, an assurance, in a State plan or 
application, a notice of award, or elsewhere, the awarding agency may 
take one or more of the following actions, as appropriate in the 
circumstances:
    (1) Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the 
deficiency by the grantee or subgrantee or more severe enforcement 
action by the awarding agency,
    (2) Disallow (that is, deny both use of funds and matching credit 
for) all or part of the cost of the activity or action not in 
compliance,
    (3) Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the current award for the 
grantee's or subgrantee's program,
    (4) Withhold further awards for the program, or
    (5) Take other remedies that may be legally available.
    (b) Hearings, appeals. In taking an enforcement action, the awarding 
agency

[[Page 392]]

will provide the grantee or subgrantee an opportunity for such hearing, 
appeal, or other administrative proceeding to which the grantee or 
subgrantee is entitled under any statute or regulation applicable to the 
action involved.
    (c) Effects of suspension and termination. Costs of grantee or 
subgrantee resulting from obligations incurred by the grantee or 
subgrantee during a suspension or after termination of an award are not 
allowable unless the awarding agency expressly authorizes them in the 
notice of suspension or termination or subsequently. Other grantee or 
subgrantee costs during suspension or after termination which are 
necessary and not reasonably avoidable are allowable if:
    (1) The costs result from obligations which were properly incurred 
by the grantee or subgrantee before the effective date of suspension or 
termination, are not in anticipation of it, and, in the case of a 
termination, are noncancellable, and,
    (2) The costs would be allowable if the award were not suspended or 
expired normally at the end of the funding period in which the 
termination takes effect.
    (d) Relationship to debarment and suspension. The enforcement 
remedies identified in this section, including suspension and 
termination, do not preclude grantee or subgrantee from being subject to 
``Debarment and Suspension'' under E.O. 12549 (see Sec. 143.35).


<R05>
Sec. 143.44  Termination for convenience.

    Except as provided in Sec. 143.43 awards may be terminated in whole 
or in part only as follows:
    (a) By the awarding agency with the consent of the grantee or 
subgrantee in which case the two parties shall agree upon the 
termination conditions, including the effective date and in the case of 
partial termination, the portion to be terminated, or
    (b) By the grantee or subgrantee upon written notification to the 
awarding agency, setting forth the reasons for such termination, the 
effective date, and in the case of partial termination, the portion to 
be terminated. However, if, in the case of a partial termination, the 
awarding agency determines that the remaining portion of the award will 
not accomplish the purposes for which the award was made, the awarding 
agency may terminate the award in its entirety under either Sec. 143.43 
or paragraph (a) of this section.


<R04>
                 Subpart D--After-The-Grant Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 143.50  Closeout.

    (a) General. The Federal agency will close out the award when it 
determines that all applicable administrative actions and all required 
work of the grant has been completed.
    (b) Reports. Within 90 days after the expiration or termination of 
the grant, the grantee must submit all financial, performance, and other 
reports required as a condition of the grant. Upon request by the 
grantee, Federal agencies may extend this timeframe. These may include 
but are not limited to:
    (1) Final performance or progress report.
    (2) Financial Status Report (SF 269) or Outlay Report and Request 
for Reimbursement for Construction Programs (SF-271) (as applicable).
    (3) Final request for payment (SF-270) (if applicable).
    (4) Invention disclosure (if applicable).
    (5) Federally-owned property report:

In accordance with Sec. 143.32(f), a grantee must submit an inventory of 
all federally owned property (as distinct from property acquired with 
grant funds) for which it is accountable and request disposition 
instructions from the Federal agency of property no longer needed.
    (c) Cost adjustment. The Federal agency will, within 90 days after 
receipt of reports in paragraph (b) of this section, make upward or 
downward adjustments to the allowable costs.
    (d) Cash adjustments. (1) The Federal agency will make prompt 
payment to the grantee for allowable reimbursable costs.
    (2) The grantee must immediately refund to the Federal agency any 
balance of unobligated (unencumbered) cash advanced that is not 
authorized to be retained for use on other grants.

[[Page 393]]


<R05>
Sec. 143.51  Later disallowances and adjustments.

    The closeout of a grant does not affect:
    (a) The Federal agency's right to disallow costs and recover funds 
on the basis of a later audit or other review;
    (b) The grantee's obligation to return any funds due as a result of 
later refunds, corrections, or other transactions;
    (c) Records retention as required in Sec. 143.42;
    (d) Property management requirements in Secs. 143.31 and 143.32; and
    (e) Audit requirements in Sec. 143.26.


<R05>
Sec. 143.52  Collection of amounts due.

    (a) Any funds paid to a grantee in excess of the amount to which the 
grantee is finally determined to be entitled under the terms of the 
award constitute a debt to the Federal Government. If not paid within a 
reasonable period after demand, the Federal agency may reduce the debt 
by:
    (1) Making an adminstrative offset against other requests for 
reimbursements,
    (2) Withholding advance payments otherwise due to the grantee, or
    (3) Other action permitted by law.
    (b) Except where otherwise provided by statutes or regulations, the 
Federal agency will charge interest on an overdue debt in accordance 
with the Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR Ch. II). The date 
from which interest is computed is not extended by litigation or the 
filing of any form of appeal.

Sec. 145.100  Purpose.

    (a) Executive Order (E.O.) 12549 provides that, to the extent 
permitted by law, Executive departments and agencies shall participate 
in a governmentwide system for nonprocurement debarment and suspension. 
A person who is debarred or suspended shall be excluded from Federal 
financial and nonfinancial assistance and benefits under Federal 
programs and activities. Debarment or suspension of a participant in a 
program by one agency shall have governmentwide effect.
    (b) These regulations implement section 3 of E.O. 12549 and the 
guidelines promulgated by the Office of Management and Budget under 
section 6 of the E.O. by:
    (1) Prescribing the programs and activities that are covered by the 
governmentwide system;
    (2) Prescribing the governmentwide criteria and governmentwide 
minimum due process procedures that each agency shall use;
    (3) Providing for the listing of debarred and suspended 
participants, participants declared ineligible (see definition of 
``ineligible'' in Sec. 145.105), and participants who have voluntarily 
excluded themselves from participation in covered transactions;
    (4) Setting forth the consequences of a debarment, suspension, 
determination of ineligibility, or voluntary exclusion; and
    (5) Offering such other guidance as necessary for the effective 
implementation and administration of the governmentwide system.
    (c) These regulations also implement Executive Order 12689 (3 CFR, 
1989 Comp., p. 235) and 31 U.S.C. 6101 note (Public Law 103-355, sec. 
2455, 108 Stat. 3327) by--
    (1) Providing for the inclusion in the List of Parties Excluded from 
Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs all persons proposed for 
debarment, debarred or suspended under the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation, 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4; persons against which 
governmentwide exclusions have been entered under this part; and persons 
determined to be ineligible; and
    (2) Setting forth the consequences of a debarment, suspension, 
determination of ineligibility, or voluntary exclusion.
    (d) Although these regulations cover the listing of ineligible 
participants and the effect of such listing, they do not prescribe 
policies and procedures governing declarations of ineligibility.

Sec. 145.110  Coverage.

    (a) These regulations apply to all persons who have participated, 
are currently participating or may reasonably be expected to participate 
in transactions under Federal nonprocurement programs. For purposes of 
these regulations such transactions will be referred to as covered 
transactions.
    (1) Covered transaction. For purposes of these regulations, a 
covered transaction is a primary covered transaction or a lower tier 
covered transaction. Covered transactions at any tier need not involve 
the transfer of Federal funds.
    (i) Primary covered transaction. Except as noted in paragraph (a)(2) 
of this section, a primary covered transaction is any nonprocurement 
transaction between an agency and a person, regardless of type, 
including: grants, cooperative agreements, scholarships, fellowships, 
contracts of assistance, loans, loan guarantees, subsidies, insurance, 
payments for specified use, donation agreements and any other 
nonprocurement transactions between a Federal agency and a person. 
Primary covered transactions also include those transactions specially 
designated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in 
such agency's regulations governing debarment and suspension.
    (ii) Lower tier covered transaction. A lower tier covered 
transaction is:
    (A) Any transaction between a participant and a person other than a 
procurement contract for goods or services, regardless of type, under a 
primary covered transaction.
    (B) Any procurement contract for goods or services between a 
participant and a person, regardless of type, expected to equal or 
exceed the Federal procurement small purchase threshold fixed at 10 
U.S.C. 2304(g) and 41 U.S.C. 253(g) (currently $25,000) under a primary 
covered transaction.
    (C) Any procurement contract for goods or services between a 
participant and a person under a covered transaction, regardless of 
amount, under which that person will have a critical influence on or 
substantive control over that covered transaction. Such persons are:
    (1) Principal investigators.
    (2) Providers of federally-required audit services.
    (3) Securities brokers and dealers under the section 7(a) Loan, 
Certified Development Company (CDC), and

[[Page 397]]

Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) Programs.
    (4) Applicant representatives under the section 7(a) Loan, Certified 
Development Company (CDC), Small Business Investment Company (SBIC), 
Small Business Development Center (SBDC) and section 7(j) Programs.
    (5) Providers of professional services under the section 7(a) Loan, 
Certified Development Center (CDC), Small Business Investment Company 
(SBIC), Small Business Development Center (SBDC), and section 7(j) 
Programs.
    (2) Exceptions. The following transactions are not covered:
    (i) Statutory entitlements or mandatory awards (but not subtier 
awards thereunder which are not themselves mandatory), including 
deposited funds insured by the Federal Government;
    (ii) Direct awards to foreign governments or public international 
organizations, or transactions with foreign governments or foreign 
governmental entities, public international organizations, foreign 
government owned (in whole or in part) or controlled entities, entities 
consisting wholly or partially of foreign governments or foreign 
governmental entities;
    (iii) Benefits to an individual as a personal entitlement without 
regard to the individual's present responsibility (but benefits received 
in an individual's business capacity are not excepted);
    (iv) Federal employment;
    (v) Transactions pursuant to national or agency-recognized 
emergencies or disasters;
    (vi) Incidental benefits derived from ordinary governmental 
operations; and
    (vii) Other transactions where the application of these regulations 
would be prohibited by law.
    (b) Relationship to other sections. This section describes the types 
of transactions to which a debarment or suspension under the regulations 
will apply. Subpart B, ``Effect of Action,'' Sec. 145.200, ``Debarment 
or suspension,'' sets forth the consequences of a debarment or 
suspension. Those consequences would obtain only with respect to 
participants and principals in the covered transactions and activities 
described in Sec. 145.110(a). Sections 145.325, ``Scope of debarment,'' 
and 145.420, ``Scope of suspension,'' govern the extent to which a 
specific participant or organizational elements of a participant would 
be automatically included within a debarment or suspension action, and 
the conditions under which affiliates or persons associated with a 
participant may also be brought within the scope of the action.
    (c) Relationship to Federal procurement activities. In accordance 
with E.O. 12689 and section 2455 of Public Law 103-355, any debarment, 
suspension, proposed debarment or other governmentwide exclusion 
initiated under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) on or after 
August 25, 1995 shall be recognized by and effective for Executive 
Branch agencies and participants as an exclusion under this regulation. 
Similarly, any debarment, suspension or other governmentwide exclusion 
initiated under this regulation on or after August 25, 1995 shall be 
recognized by and effective for those agencies as a debarment or 
suspension under the FAR.

1988; 60 FR 33041, 33044, June 26, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 145.115  Policy.

    (a) In order to protect the public interest, it is the policy of the 
Federal Government to conduct business only with responsible persons. 
Debarment and suspension are discretionary actions that, taken in 
accordance with Executive Order 12549 and these regulations, are 
appropriate means to implement this policy.
    (b) Debarment and suspension are serious actions which shall be used 
only in the public interest and for the Federal Government's protection 
and not for purposes of punishment. Agencies may impose debarment or 
suspension for the causes and in accordance with the procedures set 
forth in these regulations.
    (c) When more than one agency has an interest in the proposed 
debarment or suspension of a person, consideration shall be given to 
designating one agency as the lead agency for making the decision. 
Agencies are encouraged to establish methods and procedures for 
coordinating their debarment or suspension actions.

participating as either participants or principals in all lower tier 
covered transactions (see Sec. 145.110(a)(1)(ii)) for the period of 
their exclusion.
    (c) Exceptions. Debarment or suspension does not affect a person's 
eligibility for--

awards thereunder which are not themselves mandatory), including 
deposited funds insured by the Federal Government;
    (2) Direct awards to foreign governments or public international

governmental entities, public international organizations, foreign 
government owned (in whole or in part) or controlled entities, and

excluded in accordance with the applicable statutory, executive order, 
or regulatory authority.


<R05>

Sec. 145.215  Exception provision.

    SBA may grant an exception permitting a debarred, suspended, or 
voluntarily excluded person, or a person proposed for debarment under 48 
CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, to participate in a particular covered 
transaction upon a written determination by the agency head or an 
authorized designee stating the reason(s) for deviating from the 
Presidential policy established by Executive Order 12549 and 
Sec. 145.200. However, in accordance with the President's stated 
intention in the Executive Order, exceptions shall be granted only 
infrequently. Exceptions shall be reported in accordance with 
Sec. 145.505(a).

[60 FR 33041, 33044, June 26, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 145.220  Continuation of covered transactions.

    (a) Notwithstanding the debarment, suspension, proposed debarment 
under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, determination of ineligibility, or 
voluntary exclusion of any person by an agency, agencies and 
participants may continue covered transactions in existence at the time 
the person was debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment under 48 CFR 
part 9, subpart 9.4, declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded. A 
decision as to the type of termination action, if any, to be taken 
should be made only after thorough review to ensure the propriety of the 
proposed action.

[[Page 399]]

    (b) Agencies and participants shall not renew or extend covered 
transactions (other than no-cost time extensions) with any person who is 
debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 
9.4, ineligible or voluntary excluded, except as provided in 
Sec. 145.215.

<R05>
Sec. 145.225  Failure to adhere to restrictions.

    (a) Except as permitted under Sec. 145.215 or Sec. 145.220, a 
participant shall not knowingly do business under a covered transaction 
with a person who is--
    (1) Debarred or suspended;
    (2) Proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4; or
    (3) Ineligible for or voluntarily excluded from the covered 
transaction.
    (b) Violation of the restriction under paragraph (a) of this section 
may result in disallowance of costs, annulment or termination of award, 
issuance of a stop work order, debarment or suspension, or other 
remedies as appropriate.
    (c) A participant may rely upon the certification of a prospective 
participant in a lower tier covered transaction that it and its 
principals are not debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment under 48 
CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from the 
covered transaction (See Appendix B of these regulations), unless it 
knows that the certification is erroneous. An agency has the burden of 
proof that a participant did knowingly do business with a person that 
filed an erroneous certification.

                          Subpart C--Debarment


<R05>
Sec. 145.300  General.

    The debarring official may debar a person for any of the causes in 
Sec. 145.305, using procedures established in Secs. 145.310 through 
145.314. The existence of a cause for debarment, however, does not 
necessarily require that the person be debarred; the seriousness of the 
person's acts or omissions and any mitigating factors shall be 
considered in making any debarment decision.


<R05>
Sec. 145.305  Causes for debarment.

    Debarment may be imposed in accordance with the provisions of 
Secs. 145.300 through 145.314 for:

of one or more public agreements or transactions; or
    (3) A willful violation of a statutory or regulatory provision or

    (c) Any of the following causes:
    (1) A nonprocurement debarment by any Federal agency taken before 
October 1, 1988, the effective date of these regulations, or a 
procurement debarment by any Federal agency taken pursuant to 48 CFR 
subpart 9.4;
    (2) Knowingly doing business with a debarred, suspended, ineligible, 
or voluntarily excluded person, in connection with a covered 
transaction, except as permitted in Sec. 145.215 or Sec. 145.220;

outstanding debts (including disallowed costs and overpayments, but not 
including sums owed

[[Page 400]]

the Federal Government under the Internal Revenue Code) owed to any

the debtor or, if contested, provided that the debtor's legal and 
administrative remedies have been exhausted;
    (4) Violation of a material provision of a voluntary exclusion 
agreement entered into under Sec. 145.315 or of any settlement of a 
debarment or suspension action; or

31, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 145.310  Procedures.

    SBA shall process debarment actions as informally as practicable, 
consistent with the principles of fundamental fairness, using the 
procedures in Secs. 145.311 through 145.314.


<R05>
Sec. 145.311  Investigation and referral.

    Information concerning the existence of a cause for debarment from 
any source shall be promptly reported, investigated, and referred, when 
appropriate, to the debarring official for consideration. After 
consideration, the debarring official may issue a notice of proposed 
debarment.


<R05>
Sec. 145.312  Notice of proposed debarment.

    A debarment proceeding shall be initiated by notice to the 
respondent advising:
    (a) That debarment is being considered;
    (b) Of the reasons for the proposed debarment in terms sufficient to 
put the respondent on notice of the conduct or transaction(s) upon which 
it is based;
    (c) Of the cause(s) relied upon under Sec. 145.305 for proposing 
debarment;
    (d) Of the provisions of Secs. 145.311 through 145.314, and any

<R05>
Sec. 145.313  Opportunity to contest proposed debarment.

    (a) Submission in opposition. Within 30 days after receipt of the 
notice of proposed debarment, the respondent may submit, in person, in 
writing, or through a representative, information and argument in 
opposition to the proposed debarment.
    (b) Additional proceedings as to disputed material facts. (1) In 
actions not based upon a conviction or civil judgment, if the debarring 
official finds that the respondent's submission in opposition raises a 
genuine dispute over facts material to the proposed debarment, 
respondent(s) shall be afforded an opportunity to appear with a 
representative, submit documentary evidence, present witnesses, and 
confront any witness the agency presents.
    (2) A transcribed record of any additional proceedings shall be made 
available at cost to the respondent, upon request, unless the respondent 
and the agency, by mutual agreement, waive the requirement for a 
transcript.
    (3) In accordance with Sec. 145.314(b)(2), the debarring official 
may refer cases involving disputed material facts to the Office of 
Hearings and Appeals, which shall conduct any additional proceedings 
necessary in accordance with the procedures contained in part 134 of 
this title. Upon conclusion of such proceedings, the Office of Hearings 
and Appeals shall issue a recommended decision to the debarring official 
including proposed findings of facts and conclusions of law.

<R05>
Sec. 145.314  Debarring official's decision.

    (a) No additional proceedings necessary. In actions based upon a 
conviction or civil judgment, or in which there is no genuine dispute 
over material facts, the debarring official shall make a decision on the 
basis of all the information in the administrative record, including any 
submission made by the respondent. The decision shall be made within 45 
days after receipt of any information and argument submitted by the 
respondent, unless the debarring official extends this period for good 
cause.

[[Page 401]]

    (b) Additional proceedings necessary. (1) In actions in which 
additional proceedings are necessary to determine disputed material 
facts, written findings of fact shall be prepared. The debarring 
official shall base the decision on the facts as found, together with 
any information and argument submitted by the respondent and any other 
information in the administrative record.
    (2) The debarring official may refer disputed material facts to 
another official for findings of fact. The debarring official may reject 
any such findings, in whole or in part, only after specifically 
determining them to be arbitrary and capricious or clearly erroneous.
    (i) The Office of Hearings and Appeals shall conduct any proceedings 
regarding disputed material facts necessary under this section.
    (ii) Any party to the debarment proceeding may file exceptions to 
the recommended decision with the debarring official in accordance with 
13 CFR 134.35.
    (3) The debarring official's decision shall be made after the 
conclusion of the proceedings with respect to disputed facts.
    (c)(1) Standard of proof. In any debarment action, the cause for 
debarment must be established by a preponderance of the evidence. Where 
the proposed debarment is based upon a conviction or civil judgment, the 
standard shall be deemed to have been met.
    (2) Burden of proof. The burden of proof is on the agency proposing 
debarment.
    (d) Notice of debarring official's decision. (1) If the debarring 
official decides to impose debarment, the respondent shall be given 
prompt notice:
    (i) Referring to the notice of proposed debarment;
    (ii) Specifying the reasons for debarment;
    (iii) Stating the period of debarment, including effective dates; 
and
    (iv) Advising that the debarment is effective for covered 
transactions throughout the executive branch of the Federal Government 
unless an agency head or an authorized designee makes the determination 
referred to in Sec. 145.215.
    (2) If the debarring official decides not to impose debarment, the 
respondent shall be given prompt notice of that decision. A decision not 
to impose debarment shall be without prejudice to a subsequent 
imposition of debarment by any other agency.

Sec. 145.315  Settlement and voluntary exclusion.

    (a) When in the best interest of the Government, SBA may, at any 
time, settle a debarment or suspension action.
    (b) If a participant and the agency agree to a voluntary exclusion 
of the participant, such voluntary exclusion shall be entered on the 
Nonprocurement List (see subpart E).


<R05>
Sec. 145.320  Period of debarment.

    (a) Debarment shall be for a period commensurate with the 
seriousness of the cause(s). If a suspension precedes a debarment, the 
suspension period shall be considered in determining the debarment 
period.
    (1) Debarment for causes other than those related to a violation of 
the requirements of subpart F of this part generally should not exceed 
three years. Where circumstances warrant, a longer period of debarment 
may be imposed.
    (2) In the case of a debarment for a violation of the requirements 
of subpart F of this part (see Sec. 145.305(c)(5)), the period of 
debarment shall not exceed five years.
    (b) The debarring official may extend an existing debarment for an 
additional period, if that official determines that an extension is 
necessary to protect the public interest. However, a debarment may not 
be extended solely on the basis of the facts and circumstances upon 
which the initial debarment action was based. If debarment for an 
additional period is determined to be necessary, the procedures of 
Secs. 145.311 through 145.314 shall be followed to extend the debarment.
    (c) The respondent may request the debarring official to reverse the 
debarment decision or to reduce the period or scope of debarment. Such a 
request shall be in writing and supported by documentation. The 
debarring official

[[Page 402]]

may grant such a request for reasons including, but not limited to:
    (1) Newly discovered material evidence;
    (2) Reversal of the conviction or civil judgment upon which the 
debarment was based;
    (3) Bona fide change in ownership or management;
    (4) Elimination of other causes for which the debarment was imposed; 
or
    (5) Other reasons the debarring official deems appropriate.

<R05>
Sec. 145.325  Scope of debarment.

    (a) Scope in general. (1) Debarment of a person under these 
regulations constitutes debarment of all its divisions and other 
organizational elements from all covered transactions, unless the 
debarment decision is limited by its terms to one or more specifically 
identified individuals, divisions or other organizational elements or to 
specific types of transactions.
    (2) The debarment action may include any affiliate of the 
participant that is specifically named and given notice of the proposed 
debarment and an opportunity to respond (see Secs. 145.311 through 
145.314).
    (b) Imputing conduct. For purposes of determining the scope of 
debarment, conduct may be imputed as follows:
    (1) Conduct imputed to participant. The fraudulent, criminal or 
other seriously improper conduct of any officer, director, shareholder, 
partner, employee, or other individual associated with a participant may 
be imputed to the participant when the conduct occurred in connection 
with the individual's performance of duties for or on behalf of the 
participant, or with the participant's knowledge, approval, or 
acquiescence. The participant's acceptance of the benefits derived from 
the conduct shall be evidence of such knowledge, approval, or 
acquiescence.
    (2) Conduct imputed to individuals associated with participant. The 
fraudulent, criminal, or other seriously improper conduct of a 
participant may be imputed to any officer, director, shareholder, 
partner, employee, or other individual associated with the participant 
who participated in, knew of, or had reason to know of the participant's 
conduct.
    (3) Conduct of one participant imputed to other participants in a 
joint venture. The fraudulent, criminal, or other seriously improper 
conduct of one participant in a joint venture, grant pursuant to a joint 
application, or similar arrangement may be imputed to other participants 
if the conduct occurred for or on behalf of the joint venture, grant 
pursuant to a joint application, or similar arrangement may be imputed 
to other participants if the conduct occurred for or on behalf of the 
joint venture, grant pursuant to a joint application, or similar 
arrangement or with the knowledge, approval, or acquiescence of these 
participants. Acceptance of the benefits derived from the conduct shall 
be evidence of such knowledge, approval, or acquiescence.

                          Subpart D--Suspension


<R05>
Sec. 145.400  General.

    (a) The suspending official may suspend a person for any of the 
causes in Sec. 145.405 using procedures established in Secs. 145.410 
through 145.413.
    (b) Suspension is a serious action to be imposed only when:
    (1) There exists adequate evidence of one or more of the causes set 
out in Sec. 145.405, and
    (2) Immediate action is necessary to protect the public interest.
    (c) In assessing the adequacy of the evidence, the agency should 
consider how much information is available, how credible it is given the 
circumstances, whether or not important allegations are corroborated, 
and what inferences can reasonably be drawn as a result. This assessment 
should include an examination of basic documents such as grants, 
cooperative agreements, loan authorizations, and contracts.


<R05>
Sec. 145.405  Causes for suspension.

    (a) Suspension may be imposed in accordance with the provisions of 
Secs. 145.400 through 145.413 upon adequate evidence:
    (1) To suspect the commission of an offense listed in 
Sec. 145.305(a); or
    (2) That a cause for debarment under Sec. 145.305 may exist.

[[Page 403]]

    (b) Indictment shall constitute adequate evidence for purposes of 
suspension actions.


<R05>
Sec. 145.410  Procedures.

    (a) Investigation and referral. Information concerning the existence 
of a cause for suspension from any source shall be promptly reported, 
investigated, and referred, when appropriate, to the suspending official 
for consideration. After consideration, the suspending official may 
issue a notice of suspension.
    (b) Decisionmaking process. SBA shall process suspension actions as 
informally as practicable, consistent with principles of fundamental 
fairness, using the procedures in Secs. 145.411 through 145.413.


<R05>
Sec. 145.411  Notice of suspension.

    When a respondent is suspended, notice shall immediately be given:
    (a) That suspension has been imposed;
    (b) That the suspension is based on an indictment, conviction, or 
other adequate evidence that the respondent has committed irregularities 
seriously reflecting on the propriety of further Federal Government 
dealings with the respondent;
    (c) Describing any such irregularities in terms sufficient to put 
the respondent on notice without disclosing the Federal Government's 
evidence;
    (d) Of the cause(s) relied upon under Sec. 145.405 for imposing 
suspension;
    (e) That the suspension is for a temporary period pending the 
completion of an investigation or ensuing legal, debarment, or Program

the suspension.
    (b) Additional proceedings as to disputed material facts. (1) If the

confront any witness the agency presents, unless:
    (i) The action is based on an indictment, conviction or civil 
judgment, or

advice, that the substantial interests of the Federal Government in 
pending or contemplated legal proceedings based on the same facts as the 
suspension would be prejudiced.
    (2) A transcribed record of any additional proceedings shall be 
prepared and made available at cost to the respondent, upon request,

<R05>
Sec. 145.413  Suspending official's decision.

    The suspending official may modify or terminate the suspension (for 
example, see Sec. 145.320(c) for reasons for reducing the period or 
scope of debarment) or may leave it in force. However, a decision to 
modify or terminate the suspension shall be without prejudice to the 
subsequent imposition of suspension by any other agency or debarment by 
any agency. The decision shall be rendered in accordance with the 
following provisions:
    (a) No additional proceedings necessary. In actions: based on an 
indictment,

[[Page 404]]

conviction, or civil judgment; in which there is no genuine dispute over 
material facts; or in which additional proceedings to determine disputed 
material facts have been denied on the basis of Department of Justice 
advice, the suspending official shall make a decision on the basis of 
all the information in the administrative record, including any 
submission made by the respondent. The decision shall be made within 45 
days after receipt of any information and argument submitted by the 
respondent, unless the suspending official extends this period for good 
cause.
    (b) Additional proceedings necessary. (1) In actions in which 
additional proceedings are necessary to determine disputed material 
facts, written findings of fact shall be prepared. The suspending 
official shall base the decision on the facts as found, together with 
any information and argument submitted by the respondent and any other 
information in the administrative record.
    (2) The suspending official may refer matters involving disputed 
material facts to another official for findings of fact. The suspending 
official may reject any such findings, in whole or in part, only after 
specifically determining them to be arbitrary or capricious or clearly 
erroneous.
    (i) The Office of Hearings and Appeals shall conduct any proceedings 
regarding disputed material facts necessary under this section.
    (ii) Any party to the suspension proceeding may file exceptions to 
the recommended decision with the suspending official in accordance with 
13 CFR 134.35.
    (c) Notice of suspending official's decision. Prompt written notice 
of the suspending official's decision shall be sent to the respondent.

    (a) Suspension shall be for a temporary period pending the 
completion of an investigation or ensuing legal, debarment, or Program 
Fraud Civil Remedies Act proceedings, unless terminated sooner by the 
suspending official or as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) If legal or administrative proceedings are not initiated within 
12 months after the date of the suspension notice, the suspension shall 
be terminated unless an Assistant Attorney General or United States 
Attorney requests its extension in writing, in which case it may be 
extended for an additional six months. In no event may a suspension 
extend beyond 18 months, unless such proceedings have been initiated 
within that period.
    (c) The suspending official shall notify the Department of Justice 
of an impending termination of a suspension, at least 30 days before the 
12-month period expires, to give that Department an opportunity to 
request an extension.


<R05>

    (a) In accordance with the OMB guidelines, GSA shall compile, 
maintain, and distribute a list of all persons who have been debarred, 
suspended, or voluntarily excluded by agencies under Executive Order 
12549 and these regulations, and those who have been determined to be 
ineligible.
    (b) At a minimum, this list shall indicate:
    (1) The names and addresses of all debarred, suspended, ineligible, 
and voluntarily excluded persons, in alphabetical order, with cross-
references when more than one name is involved in a single action;
    (2) The type of action;

Sec. 145.505  SBA responsibilities.

    (a) The agency shall provide GSA with current information concerning

[[Page 405]]

debarments, suspension, determinations of ineligibility, and voluntary 
exclusions it has taken. Until February 18, 1989, the agency shall also 
provide GSA and OMB with information concerning all transactions in 
which SBA has granted exceptions under Sec. 145.215 permitting 
participation by debarred, suspended, or voluntarily excluded persons.
    (b) Unless an alternative schedule is agreed to by GSA, the agency 
shall advise GSA of the information set forth in Sec. 145.500(b) and of 
the exceptions granted under Sec. 145.215 within five working days after 
taking such actions.
    (c) The agency shall direct inquiries concerning listed persons to 
the agency that took the action.
    (d) Agency officials shall check the Nonprocurement List before 
entering covered transactions to determine whether a participant in a 
primary transaction is debarred, suspended, ineligible, or voluntarily 
excluded (Tel. ).
    (e) Agency officials shall check the Nonprocurement List before 
approving principals or lower tier participants where agency approval of 
the principal or lower tier participant is required under the terms of 
the transaction, to determine whether such principals or participants 
are debarred, suspended, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded.


<R05>
Sec. 145.510  Participants' responsibilities.

    (a) Certification by participants in primary covered transactions. 
Each participant shall submit the certification in appendix A to this 
part for it and its principals at the time the participant submits its 
proposal in connection with a primary covered transaction, except that 
States need only complete such certification as to their principals. 
Participants may decide the method and frequency by which they determine 
the eligibility of their principals. In addition, each participant may, 
but is not required to, check the Nonprocurement List for its principals 
(Tel. ). Adverse information on the certification will not necessarily 
result in denial of participation. However, the certification, and any 
additional information pertaining to the certification submitted by the 
participant, shall be considered in the administration of covered 
transactions.
    (b) Certification by participants in lower tier covered 
transactions. (1) Each participant shall require participants in lower 
tier covered transactions to include the certification in appendix B to 
this part for it and its principals in any proposal submitted in 
connection with such lower tier covered transactions.
    (2) A participant may rely upon the certification of a prospective 
participant in a lower tier covered transaction that it and its 
principals are not debarred, suspended, ineligible, or voluntarily 
excluded from the covered transaction by any Federal agency, unless it 
knows that the certification is erroneous. Participants may decide the 
method and frequency by which they determine the eligiblity of their 
principals. In addition, a participant may, but is not required to, 
check the Nonprocurement List for its principals and for participants 
(Tel. ).
    (c) Changed circumstances regarding certification. A participant 
shall provide immediate written notice to SBA if at any time the 
participant learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted 
or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. Participants 
in lower tier covered transactions shall provide the same updated notice 
to the participant to which it submitted its proposals.

section, this certification shall cover all grants to all State agencies 
from any Federal agency. The State shall retain the original of this

from the statewide certification and authorize these agencies to submit 
their own certifications to Federal agencies. The statewide 
certification shall name any State agencies so excluded.
    (2) A State agency to which the statewide certification does not 
apply, or a State agency in a State that does not have a statewide 
certification, may elect to make one certification in each Federal 
fiscal year. State agencies that previously submitted a State agency 
certification are not required to make a certification for Fiscal Year 
1990 until June 30, 1990. The State agency shall retain the original of 
this State agency-wide certification in its central office and, prior to 
grant award, shall ensure that a copy is submitted individually with 
respect to each grant, unless the Federal agency designates a central 
location for submission.
    (3) When the work of a grant is done by more than one State agency, 
the certification of the State agency directly receiving the grant shall 
be deemed to certify compliance for all workplaces, including those 
located in other State agencies.
    (e)(1) For a grant of less than 30 days performance duration, 
grantees shall have this policy statement and program in place as soon 
as possible, but in any case by a date prior to the date on which 
performance is expected to be completed.
    (2) For a grant of 30 days or more performance duration, grantees 
shall have this policy statement and program in place within 30 days 
after award.
    (3) Where extraordinary circumstances warrant for a specific grant, 
the grant officer may determine a different date on which the policy 
statement and program shall be in place.


<R05>
Sec. 145.635  Reporting of and employee sanctions for convictions of criminal drug offenses.

    (a) When a grantee other than an individual is notified that an

occurring in the workplace, it shall take the following actions:
    (1) Within 10 calendar days of receiving notice of the conviction, 
the grantee shall provide written notice, including the convicted 
employee's position title, to every grant officer, or other designee on 
whose grant activity the convicted employee was working, unless a 
Federal agency has designated a central point for the receipt of such 
notifications. Notification shall include the identification number(s) 
for each of the Federal agency's affected grants.
    (2) Within 30 calendar days of receiving notice of the conviction, 
the grantee shall do the following with respect to the employee who was 
convicted.
    (i) Take appropriate personnel action against the employee, up to 
and including termination, consistent with requirements of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended; or
    (ii) Require the employee to participate satisfactorily in a drug 
abuse assistance or rehabilitation program approved for such purposes by 
a Federal, State, or local health, law enforcement, or other appropriate 
agency.
    (b) A grantee who is an individual who is convicted for a violation 
of a criminal drug statute occurring during the conduct of any grant 
activity shall report the conviction, in writing, within 10 calendar 
days, to his or her Federal agency grant officer, or other designee, 
unless the Federal agency has designated a central point for the receipt 
of such notices. Notification shall include the identification number(s) 
for each of the Federal agency's affected grants.

                     Instructions for Certification

    1. By signing and submitting this proposal, the prospective primary 
participant is providing the certification set out below.
    2. The inability of a person to provide the certification required 
below will not necessarily result in denial of participation in this 
covered transaction. The prospective participant shall submit an 
explanation of why it cannot provide the certification set out below. 
The certification or explanation will be considered in connection with 
the department or agency's determination whether to enter into this 
transaction. However, failure of the prospective primary participant to 
furnish a certification or an explanation shall disqualify such person 
from participation in this transaction.
    3. The certification in this clause is a material representation of 
fact upon which reliance was placed when the department or agency 
determined to enter into this transaction. If it is later determined 
that the prospective primary participant knowingly rendered an erroneous 
certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Federal 
Government, the department or agency may terminate this transaction for 
cause or default.
    4. The prospective primary participant shall provide immediate 
written notice to the department or agency to which this proposal is 
submitted if at any time the prospective primary participant learns that 
its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous 
by reason of changed circumstances.
    5. The terms covered transaction, debarred, suspended, ineligible, 
lower tier covered transaction, participant, person, primary covered 
transaction, principal, proposal, and voluntarily excluded, as used in 
this clause, have the meanings set out in the Definitions and Coverage 
sections of the rules implementing Executive Order 12549. You may

with a person who is proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 
9.4, debarred, suspended, declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded 
from participation in this covered transaction, unless authorized by the 
department or agency entering into this transaction.
    7. The prospective primary participant further agrees by submitting 
this proposal that it will include the clause titled ``Certification 
Regarding Debarment, Suspension, Ineligibility and Voluntary Exclusion-
Lower Tier Covered Transaction,'' provided by the department or agency 
entering into this covered transaction, without modification, in all

certification of a prospective participant in a lower tier covered 
transaction that it is not proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, 
subpart 9.4, debarred, suspended, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded 
from the covered transaction, unless it knows that the certification is 
erroneous. A participant may decide the method and frequency by which it 
determines the eligibility of its principals. Each participant may, but 
is not required to, check the List of Parties Excluded from Federal 
Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs.
    9. Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require 
establishment of a system of records in order to render in good faith 
the certification required by this clause. The knowledge and information 
of a participant is not required to exceed that which is normally 
possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business 
dealings.
    10. Except for transactions authorized under paragraph 6 of these 
instructions, if a participant in a covered transaction knowingly enters 
into a lower tier covered transaction with a person who is proposed for 
debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, suspended, debarred, 
ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from participation in this 
transaction, in addition to other remedies available to the Federal 
Government, the department or agency may terminate this transaction for 
cause or default.

from covered transactions, unless it knows that the certification is 
erroneous. A participant may decide the method and frequency by which it 
determines the eligibility of its principals. Each participant may, but 
is not required to, check the List of Parties Excluded from Federal 
Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs.
    8. Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require 
establishment of a system of records in order to render in good faith 
the certification required by this clause. The knowledge and information 
of a participant is not required to exceed that which is normally 
possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business 
dealings.
    9. Except for transactions authorized under paragraph 5 of these 
instructions, if a participant in a covered transaction knowingly enters 
into a lower tier covered transaction with a person who is proposed for 
debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, suspended, debarred, 
ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from participation in this 
transaction, in addition to other remedies available to the Federal 
Government, the department or agency with which this transaction 
originated may pursue available remedies, including suspension and/or 
debarment.

    Certification Regarding Debarment, Suspension, Ineligibility an 
          Voluntary Exclusion--Lower Tier Covered Transactions

    (1) The prospective lower tier participant certifies, by submission 
of this proposal, that neither it nor its principals is presently 
debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, declared ineligible, or 
voluntarily excluded from participation in this transaction by any 
Federal department or agency.
    (2) Where the prospective lower tier participant is unable to 
certify to any of the statements in this certification, such prospective

[[Page 411]]

participant shall attach an explanation to this proposal.

  Appendix C to Part 145--Certification Regarding Drug-Free Workplace 
                              Requirements

                     Instructions for Certification

    1. By signing and/or submitting this application or grant agreement, 
the grantee is providing the certification set out below.
    2. The certification set out below is a material representation of 
fact upon which reliance is placed when the agency awards the grant. If 
it is later determined that the grantee knowingly rendered a false 
certification, or otherwise violates the requirements of the Drug-Free 
Workplace Act, the agency, in addition to any other remedies available 
to the Federal Government, may take action authorized under the Drug-
Free Workplace Act.
    3. For grantees other than individuals, Alternate I applies.
    4. For grantees who are individuals, Alternate II applies.
    5. Workplaces under grants, for grantees other than individuals, 
need not be identified on the certification. If known, they may be 
identified in the grant application. If the grantee does not identify 
the workplaces at the time of application, or upon award, if there is no 
application, the grantee must keep the identity of the workplace(s) on 
file in its office and make the information available for Federal 
inspection. Failure to identify all known workplaces constitutes a 
violation of the grantee's drug-free workplace requirements.
    6. Workplace identifications must include the actual address of 
buildings (or parts of buildings) or other sites where work under the 
grant takes place. Categorical descriptions may be used (e.g., all 
vehicles of a mass transit authority or State highway department while 
in operation, State employees in each local unemployment office, 
performers in concert halls or radio studios).
    7. If the workplace identified to the agency changes during the 
performance of the grant, the grantee shall inform the agency of the 
change(s), if it previously identified the workplaces in question (see 
paragraph five).
    8. Definitions of terms in the Nonprocurement Suspension and 
Debarment common rule and Drug-Free Workplace common rule apply to this 
certification. Grantees' attention is called, in particular, to the 
following definitions from these rules:
    Controlled substance means a controlled substance in Schedules I 
through V of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 812) and as 
further defined by regulation (21 CFR 1308.11 through 1308.15);
    Conviction means a finding of guilt (including a plea of nolo 
contendere) or imposition of sentence, or both, by any judicial body 
charged with the responsibility to determine violations of the Federal 
or State criminal drug statutes;
    Criminal drug statute means a Federal or non-Federal criminal 
statute involving the manufacture, distribution, dispensing, use, or 
possession of any controlled substance;
    Employee means the employee of a grantee directly engaged in the 
performance of work under a grant, including: (i) All direct charge 
employees; (ii) All indirect charge employees unless their impact or 
involvement is insignificant to the performance of the grant; and, (iii) 
Temporary personnel and consultants who are directly engaged in the 
performance of work under the grant and who are on the grantee's 
payroll. This definition does not include workers not on the payroll of 
the grantee (e.g., volunteers, even if used to meet a matching 
requirement; consultants or independent contractors not on the grantee's 
payroll; or employees of subrecipients or subcontractors in covered 
workplaces).

        Certification Regarding Drug-Free Workplace Requirements

             Alternate I. (Grantees Other Than Individuals)

    A. The grantee certifies that it will or will continue to provide a 
drug-free workplace by:

    (c) Making it a requirement that each employee to be engaged in the 
performance of the grant be given a copy of the statement required by 
paragraph (a);
    (d) Notifying the employee in the statement required by paragraph 
(a) that, as a condition of employment under the grant, the employee

[[Page 412]]

    (2) Notify the employer in writing of his or her conviction for a 
violation of a criminal drug statute occurring in the workplace no later 
than five calendar days after such conviction;
    (e) Notifying the agency in writing, within ten calendar days after 
receiving notice under paragraph (d)(2) from an employee or otherwise 
receiving actual notice of such conviction. Employers of convicted 
employees must provide notice, including position title, to every grant

was working, unless the Federal agency has designated a central point 
for the receipt of such notices. Notice shall include the identification 
number(s) of each affected grant;
    (f) Taking one of the following actions, within 30 calendar days of 
receiving notice under paragraph (d)(2), with respect to any employee 
who is so convicted--

_______________________________________________________________________

Check {time}  if there are workplaces on file that are not identified 
here.

              Alternate II. (Grantees Who Are Individuals)

    (a) The grantee certifies that, as a condition of the grant, he or 
she will not engage in the unlawful manufacture, distribution, 
dispensing, possession, or use of a controlled substance in conducting 
any activity with the grant;
    (b) If convicted of a criminal drug offense resulting from a 
violation occurring during the conduct of any grant activity, he or she 
will report the conviction, in writing, within 10 calendar days of the 
conviction, to every grant officer or other designee, unless the Federal 
agency designates a central point for the receipt of such notices. When 
notice is made to such a central point, it shall include the 
identification number(s) of each affected grant.

form, if required, under paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Each person shall file a disclosure form at the end of each 
calendar quarter in which there occurs any event that requires 
disclosure or that materially affects the accuracy of the information

the accuracy of the information reported includes:
    (1) A cumulative increase of $25,000 or more in the amount paid or 
expected to be paid for influencing or attempting to influence a covered 
Federal action; or
    (2) A change in the person(s) or individual(s) influencing or

forms to the agency.
    (f) Any certification or disclosure form filed under paragraph (e)

erroneous representation is forwarded. Submitting an erroneous 
certification or disclosure constitutes a failure to file the required 
certification or disclosure, respectively. If a person fails to file a 
required certification or disclosure, the United States may pursue all 
available remedies, including those authorized by section 1352, title

<R05>
Sec. 146.200  Agency and legislative liaison.

    (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in 
Sec. 146.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable 
compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or 
receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if 
the payment is for agency and legislative liaison activities not 
directly related to a covered Federal action.

[[Page 416]]

    (b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, providing any 
information specifically requested by an agency or Congress is allowable 
at any time.
    (c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following 
agency and legislative liaison activities are allowable at any time only 
where they are not related to a specific solicitation for any covered 
Federal action:
    (1) Discussing with an agency (including individual demonstrations) 
the qualities and characteristics of the person's products or services, 
conditions or terms of sale, and service capabilities; and,
    (2) Technical discussions and other activities regarding the 
application or adaptation of the person's products or services for an 
agency's use.
    (d) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following 
agencies and legislative liaison activities are allowable only where 
they are prior to formal solicitation of any covered Federal action:
    (1) Providing any information not specifically requested but 
necessary for an agency to make an informed decision about initiation of 
a covered Federal action;
    (2) Technical discussions regarding the preparation of an 
unsolicited proposal prior to its official submission; and,
    (3) Capability presentations by persons seeking awards from an 
agency pursuant to the provisions of the Small Business Act, as amended 
by Public Law 95-507 and other subsequent amendments.
    (e) Only those activities expressly authorized by this section are 
allowable under this section.


<R05>
Sec. 146.205  Professional and technical services.

    (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in 
Sec. 146.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable 
compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or 
receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or 
an extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of a 
Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if payment is 
for professional or technical services rendered directly in the 
preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or 
application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative 
agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a 
condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or 
cooperative agreement.
    (b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, professional and 
technical services shall be limited to advice and analysis directly 
applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting 
of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is 
allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the 
performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered 
directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, 
communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such 
as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed 
accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide 
advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical 
expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and 
solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered 
Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to 
influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis 
directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's 
proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not 
allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing 
professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent 
to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior 
to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable 
under this section since the engineer is providing technical services 
but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a 
covered Federal action.
    (c) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for 
receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or 
regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by

[[Page 417]]

law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award 
documents.
    (d) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are 
allowable under this section.


<R05>
Sec. 146.210  Reporting.

    No reporting is required with respect to payments of reasonable 
compensation made to regularly employed officers or employees of a 
person.


<R04>
            Subpart C--Activities by Other Than Own Employees


<R05>
Sec. 146.300  Professional and technical services.

    (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in 
Sec. 146.100 (a), does not apply in the case of any reasonable payment 
to a person, other than an officer or employee of a person requesting or 
receiving a covered Federal action, if the payment is for professional 
or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, 
or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal 
contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting 
requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving 
that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.
    (b) The reporting requirements in Sec. 146.110 (a) and (b) regarding 
filing a disclosure form by each person, if required, shall not apply 
with respect to professional or technical services rendered directly in 
the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any commitment providing 
for the United States to insure or guarantee a loan.
    (c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, professional and 
technical services shall be limited to advice and analysis directly 
applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting 
or a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is 
allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the 
performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered 
directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, 
communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such 
as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed 
accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide 
advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical 
expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and 
solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered 
Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to

<R05>
Sec. 146.400  Penalties.

[[Page 418]]

more than $100,000 for each such failure.
    (c) A filing or amended filing on or after the date on which an 
administrative action for the imposition of a civil penalty is commenced 
does not prevent the imposition of such civil penalty for a failure 
occurring before that date. An administrative action is commenced with 
respect to a failure when an investigating official determines in 
writing to commence an investigation of an allegation of such failure.
    (d) In determining whether to impose a civil penalty, and the amount 
of any such penalty, by reason of a violation by any person, the agency 
shall consider the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the 
violation, the effect on the ability of such person to continue in 
business, any prior violations by such person, the degree of culpability 
of such person, the ability of the person to pay the penalty, and such 
other matters as may be appropriate.
    (e) First offenders under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section 
shall be subject to a civil penalty of $10,000, absent aggravating 
circumstances. Second and subsequent offenses by persons shall be 
subject to an appropriate civil penalty between $10,000 and $100,000, as 
determined by the agency head or his or her designee.
    (f) An imposition of a civil penalty under this section does not 
prevent the United States from seeking any other remedy that may apply 
to the same conduct that is the basis for the imposition of such civil 
penalty.


<R05>
Sec. 146.405  Penalty procedures.

    Agencies shall impose and collect civil penalties pursuant to the 
provisions of the Program Fraud and Civil Remedies Act, 31 U.S.C. 
sections 3803 (except subsection (c)), 3804, 3805, 3806, 3807, 3808, and

interest. The Secretary shall transmit a copy of each such written 
exemption to Congress immediately after making such a determination.
    (b) The Department of Defense may issue supplemental regulations to 
implement paragraph (a) of this section.

only to the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate, the 
Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of 
Representatives, and the Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and 
the House of Representatives in accordance with procedures agreed to by 
such committees. Such information shall not be available for public 
inspection.
    (d) Information that is classified under Executive Order 12356 or 
any successor order shall be reported only to the Committee on Foreign 
Relations of the Senate and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the

the effectiveness of, the requirements herein. The evaluation may 
include any recommended changes that may be necessary to strengthen or 
improve the requirements.
    (b) In the case of an agency that does not have an Inspector 
General, the agency official comparable to an Inspector General shall 
prepare and submit the annual report, or, if there is no such comparable 
official, the head of the agency shall prepare and submit the annual 
report.
    (c) The annual report shall be submitted at the same time the agency

                  Subject to Section 401(a) of the Act


<R05>
Sec. 301.1  Designation on the basis of unemployment.

    On the basis of labor force data on unemployment supplied by the

<R05>

<R05>
Sec. 301.4  Designation on the basis of American Indian lands.

    (a) EDA shall designate as Redevelopment Areas those American Indian 
reservations, American Indian trust land areas, and restricted American 
Indian-owned land areas, including Alaskan Native Villages, which 
manifest the greatest degree of economic distress.
    (1) American Indian reservations shall consist of land areas which 
by official Federal or State action or recognition have been reserved 
for the use and benefit of a specific American Indian tribe or tribes, 
and shall include those lands to which the Federal or State Government 
retains title and may include tribally-owned lands, lands allotted to 
individual tribal members, and interspersed land belonging to non-

held in trust by or under the authority of Federal or State Government 
for use and occupancy by American Indians.
    (3) Restricted American Indian-owned land areas shall consist of

appropriate evidence of economic underdevelopment.
    (c) EDA, upon consultation with the Secretary of Interior or an 
appropriate State agency, may designate uninhabited Federal or State 
American Indian reservations or trust or restricted American Indian-
owned land areas where such designation would permit assistance to 
American Indian tribes, with a direct beneficial effect on the economic 
well-being of American Indians.
    (d) When the determination of economic distress pertains to land 
areas that are not contiguous, it must be shown that there is a clear 
economic connection justifying the inclusion of the noncontiguous land 
areas that will contribute to a more effective economic development 
program for the area.

firm or industry; or
    (2) Job losses in more than a single firm or in more than in a 
single industry may be considered in the aggregate where:
    (i) There is a clear demonstrable economic connection between or 
among the firms or industries; or
    (ii) More than one firm or industry has been affected by a common 
disaster.
    (3) A major source of employment is when its loss, removal, 
curtailment, or closing has caused or can reasonably be expected to 
cause:

    (ii) An increase of 2 percentage points or more in the area's 
unemployment

[[Page 430]]

rate, based on the relationship of actual or expected additional 
unemployed to the number of persons in the area's labor force.
    (b) Where there is an actual or threatened closing of a major source 
of employment within 3 years after the date of the area's request 
provided that:
    (1) The rise in unemployment must be shown to be unusual or unique 
for the area, the industry, and the time of year; and
    (2) Such rise must have occurred or be reasonably expected to occur 
during a 1-year period within the qualifying span of 3 years before to 3 
years after the date of the request for designation.
    (c) The area's unemployment rate can reasonably be expected to 
exceed the national average by 50 percent or more, except for those job-
loss situations in which it is public knowledge that the jobs lost were 
or will be of a type in such great demand that the persons laid off were 
or will be readily reemployable.
    (d) Areas designated under this section are allowed a reasonable

elected officials and/or employees of a general purpose unit of local 
government who have been appointed to represent the government.
    (i) Where appointment of local government members is not otherwise

appointed to represent that government.
    (i) The district organization shall demonstrate that persons 
fulfilling this requirement represent the interests of groups listed in 
paragraphs (c)(1)(i) or (iii) of this section. Minority and low-income 
representatives who meet these criteria may be counted toward the 
fulfillment of the private citizen requirement.
    (ii) Except where these private citizens are also selected as 
minority/low-income representatives under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this 
section, these representatives shall be appointed by the governing 
bodies of the counties actively participating in the district 
organization or as otherwise provided in the district organizational 
charter and by-laws.
    (d) Staff support is provided as follows:
    (1) The district organization shall be assisted by a professional 
staff drawn from qualified persons in planning, economics, business 
administration, engineering and related disciplines.
    (2) EDA may provide planning grants to economic development

concerning ongoing and proposed district activities of the proposed 
district or EDD in accord with the following requirements:
    (1) The district organization shall conduct meetings open to the 
public at least once a year and shall also publish the date and agenda 
of the meeting at least four weeks in advance to allow the public a 
reasonable time to prepare to participate effectively in the meetings.
    (2) The district organization shall adopt a system of parliamentary 
procedures to assure that board members and others have access to and an 
effective opportunity to participate in the affairs of the proposed 
district or EDD.
    (3) Information should be provided sufficiently in advance of public 
decisions to give the public adequate opportunity to review and react to 
proposals. District organizations should seek to relate technical data 
and other material to the public so that they may understand the impact 
of public programs, available options and alternative decisions.

concurrence from the State must be received by EDA;
    (c) Is geographically and economically so related to the economic 
development district that the economic development center's economic 
growth may be expected to contribute significantly to the alleviation of 
distress in the redevelopment areas of the district;
    (d) Does not have a population in excess of 250,000 according to the 
last preceding Federal census;
    (e) May reasonably be expected to accelerate or maintain existing

than one leading economic development center.


<R05>
Sec. 302.12  Boundaries of economic development centers and boundary modifications.

    (a) An economic development center is administratively defined as a 
city or grouping of contiguous incorporated places. However, where 
justified, boundaries may be extended to include adjoining minor civil 
divisions or corridors of growth between centers.
    (b) EDA may modify either the boundaries of an economic development 
center or the number of economic development centers in a district after 
giving notice and opportunity for comment to the State or States 
affected, if such modification will contribute to a more effective 
program.

<R05>
Sec. 304.1  General selection process and evaluation criteria for programs under PWEDA.

    EDA has established a streamlined and uniform selection process 
based upon a short proposal and standardized application form with 
attachments as applicable to each particular program. Additional 
information if any, is set forth in program specific parts/sections. EDA 
applies uniform evaluation criteria to all programs, as well as 
evaluation criteria which are set forth in parts 305, 307 and 308 of 
this chapter.
    (a) The selection process is described as follows:
    (1) For projects to be funded under parts 305, 307 and 308 of this 
chapter proponents will submit forms to EDA during the selection process 
as follows:
    (i) There will be a brief proposal on the OMB approved form, number 
0610-0094, consisting of the face sheet (SF-424) and two additional 
pages, except for projects under part 307, subparts C and D, of this 
chapter for which proponents may include more than two pages if 
necessary to provide adequate information to EDA upon which to make an 
informed determination whether to invite a more comprehensive proposal 
and application, including for example, budget, scope of work and 
capability statements.
    (ii) There will be a standard application for all programs which 
will include an additional attachment for each program as appropriate.
    (2) For projects to be funded under part 307--Subparts A, B, E and F 
and parts 305 and 308 of this chapter, requirements are as follows:
    (i) Initial contact with EDA will generally be through contact with 
the appropriate Economic Development Representative (EDR) (see 
Sec. 300.4 of this chapter) who will provide assistance as needed in 
filling out the proposal as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section.
    (ii) Such proposals, whether received through contact with the 
appropriate Economic Development Representative (EDR) or Regional Office 
of EDA, shall have the opportunity to be formally reviewed by the 
appropriate Regional Office Project Review Committee (consisting of at 
least three EDA officials) (PRC). Generally, an EDR will evaluate

[[Page 441]]

proposals under paragraph (b) of this section before submitting them to 
the EDA Regional Office for such review.
    (iii) The results of these PRC meetings shall be communicated to the 
proponents in writing and in a timely manner, advising them that they 
are: being invited to submit a formal application; having their 
application returned because of specified deficiencies (resubmissions 
will be allowed when the deficiencies are cured) or being denied for 
specific reasons.
    (iv) An invitation to submit an application does not assure EDA 
funding.
    (v) Applications are generally to be submitted within 30 days after 
receipt of an invitation letter.
    (3) For projects to be funded under part 307--Subparts C and D of 
this chapter, requirements are as follows:
    (i) Initial contact by proponents for information and assistance 
concerning proposals will generally be with Washington, DC, at locations 
noted in Secs. 307.13 and 307.18 of this chapter.
    (ii) Generally, proposals will be reviewed for relevance and quality 
by three or more technically knowledgeable EDA officials.
    (iii) If the proposal is acceptable under paragraph (b) of this 
section, EDA may invite proponents to submit applications which must 
include a more detailed and comprehensive project narrative.
    (iv) An invitation to submit an application does not assure EDA 
funding.
    (v) Applications are generally to be submitted within 30 days after 
receipt of an invitation letter.
    (b) General evaluation criteria for projects to be funded under 
parts 305, 307 and 308 of this chapter in addition to criteria noted in 
such parts, are as follows: All proposals/applications will be screened 
for conformance to statutory and regulatory requirements, the relative 
severity of the economic problem of the area, the quality of the scope 
of work proposed to address the problem, the merits of the activity(ies) 
for which funding is requested, and the ability of the prospective 
applicant to carry out the proposed activity(ies) successfully. The NOFA 
may identify special areas of interest for the fiscal year of such NOFA.

<R04>
                           Subpart A--General


<R05>
Sec. 305.1  Purpose and scope.

    The purpose of the Public Works Program is to assist communities 
with the funding of public works and development facilities that 
contribute to the creation or retention of primarily private sector jobs 
and alleviation of unemployment and underemployment. Such assistance is 
designed to help communities achieve lasting improvement by stabilizing 
and diversifying local economies and by improving local living 
conditions and the economic development of the area. Alleviation of 
unemployment and underemployment among residents of the project area is 
a primary focus of this program.


<R05>
Sec. 305.2  Applicants.

    Eligible applicants under this program include:
    (a) States, or political subdivisions thereof;
    (b) American Indian tribes;
    (c) The Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall 
Islands, the Republic of Palau, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the 
Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa and the Commonwealth of the 
Northern Mariana Islands; and
    (d) A private or public non-profit organization or association 
representing any redevelopment area or part thereof, provided the EDA 
project is located within an eligible EDA area represented by such non-
profit organization or association.
    (e) When the applicant is not a State, American Indian tribe or 
other general-purpose governmental authority, the applicant must afford 
the appropriate local governmental authority of the area a minimum of 15 
days in which to review and comment on the proposed project. The 
applicant shall furnish with the application a copy of such comments, or 
a statement of the efforts made to obtain them together with an 
explanation of the actions taken to address any comments received.


<R05>
Sec. 305.3  Eligibility requirements.

    (a) Other than those areas designated under PWIP, applicant areas, 
including Special Impact Areas (SIAs) must have a current EDA approved 
Overall Economic Development Program (OEDP).
    (b) Political entities claiming eligibility under OEDPs developed by 
multicounty economic development organizations are expected to continue 
to participate actively in the organization.
    (c) Non-profit organizations or associations must meet the following 
requirements:
    (1) Such non-profit organizations or associations must represent a 
redevelopment area or part thereof, if EDA determines that such 
applicant is potentially capable of furthering the objectives of the 
economic development program of the area in which it is located;
    (2) To the extent possible, non-profit applicants are urged to seek 
the cooperation and support of units of local government; and
    (3) When deemed appropriate by EDA, have the local government as co-
applicant for EDA assistance. This ensures the financial stability and 
continuity of the project in the event that the non-profit entity finds 
itself in a position of not having the financial resources to 
administer, operate, and maintain the EDA assisted facility in a proper 
and efficient manner consistent with the provisions of part 314 of this 
chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 305.4  Project requirements.

    (a) Public works projects other than PWIP projects must meet the 
following requirements:
    (1) Be consistent with the EDA approved OEDP for the area in which 
it is or will be located, and have broad community support;
    (2) Improve opportunities for the successful establishment or 
expansion of industrial or commercial facilities in the area where such 
project will be located;
    (3) The project will not result in the increase of goods or services 
beyond the demand for such goods or services existing or to be created 
in the market area;
    (4) The project fulfills a pressing need of the area or part 
thereof, in which it is located;
    (5) There is adequate local matching share; and

[[Page 443]]

    (6) The project benefits the long-term unemployed and members of 
low-income families who are residents of the area to be served.
    (b) PWIP projects must create immediate useful work for the 
unemployed and underemployed residents in the project area.


<R05>
Sec. 305.5  Selection process.

    Projects will be selected in accordance with Sec. 304.1 of this 
chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 305.6  Evaluation criteria.

    In addition to and/or as an elaboration of the evaluation criteria 
set forth in part 304 of this chapter of this chapter and to the extent 
practicable, evaluations are made on the basis of whether the proposed 
project:
    (a) Assists in creating or retaining private sector jobs (primarily 
in the near term) and assists in the creation of additional long-term 
employment opportunities (provided the jobs have not been transferred 
from another commuting area of the United States) and will result in low 
costs-per-job in relation to total EDA costs, evidenced for example by:
    (1) Commitments to create such jobs;
    (2) Marketing; and
    (3) Financial capabilities of the applicant.
    (b) Is supported by significant private sector investment.
    (c) Maximizes the amount of local, state or other Federal funding 
that is available.
    (d) Is likely to be started and completed in a timely fashion.
    (e) If located in an EDC with a stable economy and little distress, 
an employment plan is required that explains how new employment 
opportunities for residents of nearby highly distressed redevelopment 
areas will be provided.
    (f) To the extent possible, factors that will be considered in the 
evaluation of PWIP projects include whether the proposed project:
    (1) Improves the economic or community environment in areas of 
severe economic distress;
    (2) Includes an acceptable plan for hiring the unemployed and 
underemployed from the project area to work on construction of the 
project;
    (3) Assists in providing long-term employment opportunities or other 
economic benefits for the unemployed and underemployed in the project 
area;
    (4) Primarily benefits low-income families by providing essential 
community services, or satisfying a pressing public need;
    (5) Involves construction which can be started (normally within 120 
days after affirmation of the award), and completed quickly (normally 
within one year) preferably without early construction start; or
    (6) Has significant labor intensity (i.e., the proportion of labor 
costs to the total project costs).


<R05>
Sec. 305.7  Award requirements.

    (a) Projects are expected to be completed in a timely manner 
consistent with the nature of the project. Normally, the maximum period 
for any financial assistance that is provided shall be not more than 5 
years from the end of the fiscal year of the award.
    (b) Matching Requirements are as follows:
    (1) EDA may provide direct grants not to exceed 50 percent of the 
estimated cost of the project;
    (2) Under certain circumstances supplementary grants to augment the 
direct grant may be provided up to a maximum of 80 percent of the 
eligible project costs, though waivers may be permitted in accordance 
with Section 101(c) of the Act. Supplementary grant assistance to 
finance over 50 percent of the project costs will be approved by EDA 
only for projects in areas of high distress. Decisions on such 
supplementary grant assistance will be based on the nature of the 
project, the amount of fair user charges or other revenues the project 
may reasonably be expected to generate, and the relative needs of the 
area;
    (3) Applicants are required to provide the local share from 
acceptable sources;
    (4) The local share need not be in hand at the time of application; 
however, the applicant must assure EDA that such share is committed and 
will be available at the time the award is accepted; and

[[Page 444]]

    (5) The local share must not be encumbered in any way that would 
preclude its use consistent with the requirements of the grant.

located in EDDs pursuant to section 403(j) of the Act shall be the same 
as the grant rates for the redevelopment areas for which such projects 
are determined to be a direct and substantial benefit.
    (d) Notwithstanding paragraph (c) of this section, an applicant 
shall be eligible for the highest applicable maximum grant rate in 
effect between the time EDA invites the application and the time the 
project is approved.
    (e) Where municipalities of over 25,000 population qualify for

    (a) For the purposes of this section, construction cost increases 
means those costs which the applicant incurs or will incur in completing 
the project according to the original designs and specifications beyond 
the project costs set forth in the grant agreement.
    (b) EDA may increase the amount of any grant made under the 
authority of Title I of the Act when the following conditions are met:
    (1) The project is being or will be constructed in accordance with 
the original designs and specifications or in accord with final plans 
and specifications which reflect the original intent and purpose;
    (2) The project's total cost has increased because of increases in 
costs based on the original designs and specifications (or based on 
final plans and specifications reflecting the original intent and 
purpose); and
    (3) The project has incurred construction cost increases after the 
grant was made but prior to completion of the project.

                      Subpart C--Other Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 305.11  Disbursements of funds for grants.

    (a) Though disbursements of funds for grants are generally made upon 
application for reimbursement, advances of funds are allowable at the 
discretion of EDA. Disbursements will be made when the following 
conditions have been met:
    (1) After execution of all contracts required for the completion of 
the project. This condition may be waived by EDA if the grantee can 
demonstrate that enforcement of the condition would place an undue 
burden on it;
    (2) For itemized and certified eligible costs incurred, as 
substantiated by such documentary evidence as EDA may require;
    (3) For the percentage of EDA participation, but in no event for 
more than the total sum stated in the financial assistance award 
accepted by the grantee;
    (4) Upon such evidence as EDA may require that grantee's 
proportionate share of funds is on deposit;
    (5) After a determination by EDA that all applicable conditions of 
the grant have been met; and
    (6) After meeting such other requirements as EDA shall establish.
    (b) Disbursements are generally made in installments, based upon 
grantee's actual rate of disbursement in accordance with the grant rate.


<R05>
Sec. 305.12  Variance in cost of grant projects.

    (a) If the total eligible costs are equal to or exceed the amount 
stated in the financial assistance award, disbursements will be the 
amount identified in the financial assistance award.
    (b) If the total eligible project costs are less than the amount 
stated in the financial assistance award, the disbursements will be 
determined by multiplying the total eligible project costs by the grant 
rate percentage.

[[Page 446]]

    (c) The grant rate percentage is determined by dividing the total 
estimated project costs stated in the financial assistance award into 
the amount of EDA funding provided in the grant. For example, if the 
financial assistance award states that EDA will provide $50,000 for a 
project estimated to cost $100,000, the grant rate is 50% ($50,000 
divided by $100,000). If the actual eligible project costs were 
$100,000, EDA would provide $50,000. If the actual eligible project 
costs were $120,000, EDA would still provide $50,000. If the actual 
eligible project costs were only $80,000, EDA would provide $40,000 (50% 
x $80,000).


<R05>
Sec. 305.13  Final inspection.

    A final inspection will be scheduled by the grantee, with EDA 
concurrence and/or participation, when the project has been completed 
and is functional and when all deficiencies have been corrected.

<R05>
Sec. 308.1  Purpose and scope.

    (a) The Economic Adjustment Program addresses the particular needs 
of

[[Page 452]]

areas experiencing changes in their economic situation which are 
causing, or threaten to cause, serious structural damage to the 
underlying economic base. Such changes may occur suddenly or over time, 
for example, as a result of industrial or corporate restructuring in 
response to technological advancements or changes in the marketplace, 
new Federal laws or requirements, reductions in defense expenditures, or 
depletion of natural resources or natural disasters.
    (b) Economic Adjustment grants are awarded for the purpose of 
enabling communities in such areas to meet the challenge of economic 
change more effectively through the development and implementation of 
strategies for inducing capital investment in production of the types of 
goods and/or services for which the community may have or be able to 
develop a comparative economic advantage, and which will lead to 
economic recovery and saving and/or creating permanent jobs.
    (c) Overall funding objectives of this program are to:
    (1) Provide impacted communities with the skills and knowledge 
needed to organize and carry out a strategic planning process focusing 
on increasing the productivity and competitiveness of a community's 
assets, such as for example, existing industries and business acumen, 
natural resources, or labor force skills;
    (2) Expand the capacity of public officials and development 
organizations to work more effectively with their business community to 
identify and address unmet needs of the types of firms identified in 
area strategies. Such needs include, for example, management assistance 
and information to help with modernization, financing, market research, 
and new product development;
    (3) Assist communities to overcome critical impediments to 
implementing their adjustment strategy. Such impediments include, for 
example, a lack of available financing for the businesses or weaknesses 
in economic infrastructure;
    (4) Enable communities to plan and coordinate:
    (i) The use of Federal, and/or other resources available to support 
economic recovery from Federal actions adversely affecting a major 
industrial sector;
    (ii) The economy of a discrete geographic region; or
    (iii) Recovery from natural disasters.
    (5) Encourage the development of innovative public/private 
approaches to economic restructuring and revitalization.


<R05>
Sec. 308.2  Use of economic adjustment grants.

    (a) Grants shall be used to develop or implement economic adjustment 
strategies. Strategy grants provide the resources for organizing and 
conducting a strategic planning process. Implementation grants support 
one or more activities identified in an adjustment strategy approved by 
EDA. Such activities include the following, which may be undertaken 
singly or in combination:
    (1) Infrastructure improvements, such as for example, acquisition, 
site preparation, construction, rehabilitation and/or equipping of 
eligible facilities;
    (2) Provision of business financing through establishment of locally 
administered revolving loan funds (RLFs);
    (3) Planning, including strategy development, updating or 
refinement;
    (4) Market or industry research and analysis;
    (5) Technical assistance, including organizational development such 
as business networking, restructuring or improving the delivery of 
business services, or for feasibility studies;
    (6) Public Services;
    (7) Training; and
    (8) Other activities as justified by the economic adjustment 
strategy which meet statutory and regulatory requirements.
    (b) Adjustment grants may be disbursed by the grantee through direct 
expenditures or through redistribution by them to public and private 
entities.
    (1) Redistribution in the form of grants may only be to units of 
government or to public or private non-profit organizations.

[[Page 453]]

    (2) Redistribution in the form of loans, loan guarantees or other 
appropriate assistance may be to public or private entities.


<R05>

<R05>
Sec. 308.4  Eligible areas.

    (a) General. The area(s) to be assisted by the applicant must be 
eligible on the basis of the criteria described below for establishing 
that it is experiencing either Long-Term Economic Deterioration (LTED) 
or a Sudden and Severe Economic Dislocation (SSED) or a Special Need.
    (b) LTED. The area must be experiencing at least one of three 
economic problems:
    (1) Very high unemployment;
    (2) Low per capita income; or
    (3) Chronic distress (i.e., failure to keep pace with national 
economic growth trends over the last 5 years). Priority consideration 
will be given to those areas with two or more of these indicators. 
Eligibility is generally determined statistically. Further information 
is available from EDA's regional offices and EDRs (see Sec. 300.4 of 
this chapter).
    (c) SSED. The area must show actual or threatened permanent job 
losses that exceed the following threshold criteria:
    (1) For areas not in Metropolitan Statistical Areas:
    (i) If the unemployment rate of the Labor Market Area exceeds the 
national average, the dislocation must amount to the lesser of 2 percent 
of the employed population, or 500 direct jobs; and
    (ii) If the unemployment rate of the Labor Market Area is equal to 
or less than the national average, the dislocation must amount to the 
lesser of 4 percent of the employed population, or 1,000 direct jobs.
    (2) For areas within Metropolitan Statistical Areas:
    (i) If the unemployment rate of the Metropolitan Statistical Area 
exceeds the national average, the dislocation must amount to the lesser 
of 0.5 percent of the employed population, or 4,000 direct jobs; and
    (ii) If the unemployment rate of the Metropolitan Statistical Area 
is equal to or less than the national average, the dislocation must 
amount to the lesser of 1 percent of the employed population or 8,000 
direct jobs.
    (3) In addition, 50 percent of the job loss threshold must result 
from the action of a single employer, or 80 percent of the job loss 
threshold must occur in a single standard industry classification (i.e., 
two digit SIC code).
    (4) Actual dislocations must have occurred within one year and 
threatened dislocations must be anticipated to occur within 2 years of 
the date EDA is contacted.
    (5) In the case of a Presidentially declared disaster, the area 
eligibility criteria findings are waived.
    (d) Special need. An area must be determined by EDA to require 
assistance for another kind of economic adjustment problem or problems.


<R05>
Sec. 308.5  Selection process.

    (a) Projects will be selected in accordance with Sec. 304.1 of this 
chapter.
    (b) Applicants for funding of a Revolving Loan Fund (RLF) are 
generally required to submit a RLF Plan in addition to the adjustment 
strategy for the area. Guidelines on RLFs are available

[[Page 454]]

from the Regional Offices. See the annual FY NOFA for the appropriate 
point of contact and address.

<R05>
Sec. 308.6  Evaluation factors.

    (a) General. EDA will use the evaluation criteria set forth in part 
304 of this chapter. To the extent practicable, EDA will use the 
evaluation factors set out in this section in the selection process:
    (b) Strategy grants. EDA will review strategy grant applications to 
determine whether:
    (1) The applicant organization has the necessary authority, mandate 
and capacity to lead and manage the planning process and implementation 
of the resulting strategy;
    (2) The planning process provides for the representation of public 
and private sector entities with a contribution to make to the 
development of the strategy and/or on which accomplishment of the 
strategic objectives will depend. These entities include public program 
and service providers, trade and business associations, educational and 
research institutions, and community development corporations, etc.; and
    (3) The proposed scope of work focuses on the specific economic 
problems to be addressed and provides for undertaking the appropriate 
research and analysis needed to formulate a realistic, market-based, 
adjustment strategy.
    (c) Implementation grants. EDA will review implementation grant 
applications to determine whether:
    (1) Strategies have been completed; provided however, that EDA may 
in some instances, consider funding a project prior to completion of the 
strategy/plan, if:
    (i) An appropriate community planning process is underway;
    (ii) Sufficient analysis has been done to show that the proposed 
project is economically viable and potentially consistent with the 
evolving strategy; and
    (iii) The proposed project has the support of the community.
    (2) Activities or projects proposed for funding are generally 
identifiable as integral and priority elements within an adjustment 
strategy for the eligible area(s) prepared or updated within the 
preceding 2 years;
    (3) The strategy addresses the following:
    (i) An appropriately designed and conducted planning process;
    (ii) An understanding of the economic problems being addressed;
    (iii) An analysis of the industry sectors and the firms within them 
that comprise the area's economic base, and of the particular strengths 
and weaknesses of the area that contribute to, or detract from, its 
current and potential economic competitiveness;
    (iv) Strategic objectives that flow from the economic analysis and 
conclusions and focus on stimulating investment in new and/or expanding 
economic activities that offer the best prospects for revitalization and 
growth;
    (v) Appropriate and necessary resources in the area and elsewhere 
which have been identified and are/will be coordinated to support 
implementation of the strategy; and
    (vi) The performance measures which the applicant will use to assess 
progress toward accomplishing its strategic objectives.
    (4) All individual activities or projects proposed for funding are 
consistent with one or more of the Economic Adjustment Program 
objectives stated in Sec. 308.1.
    (d) Revolving Loan Fund grants. For implementation grants proposing 
to capitalize or recapitalize a Revolving Loan Fund (RLF), EDA will also 
review how the application discusses:
    (1) The need for a new or expanded public financing tool to 
complement other business assistance programs and services available to 
firms and/or would-be entrepreneurs in industry sectors and/or locations 
targeted by the adjustment strategy;
    (2) The types of financing activities anticipated; and
    (3) The prospective capacity of the RLF's organization to work 
effectively with the business community and other financing providers, 
to function as an integral part of the overall economic adjustment 
effort and to manage the lending function.

[[Page 455]]


<R05>
Sec. 308.7  Award requirements.

    (a) Projects are expected to be completed in a timely manner 
consistent with the nature of the project. Normally, the maximum period 
for any financial assistance that is provided shall be not more than 5 
years from the end of the fiscal year of the award.
    (b) Title IX funds are awarded through grants generally not to 
exceed 75 percent of the project cost. EDA may waive all or part of the 
25 percent nonfederal share of economic adjustment assistance grants, 
because of the critical nature of the situation requiring economic 
adjustment assistance, or for other good cause. The local share must not 
be encumbered in any way that would preclude its use as required by the 
grant agreement. The local share for grants to establish or recapitalize 
a RLF must be in cash, and while the local share for grants for other 
activities may be cash or in-kind, priority consideration will be given 
to proposals with a cash local share.
    (c) Direct recipients of grant assistance shall submit a report to 
EDA each year that the assistance continues in accordance with the Act. 
The report shall include:
    (1) Whether planned activities are completed or their anticipated 
completion time;
    (2) The degree to which activities have achieved their planned goals 
as described in the plan; and
    (d) RLF grantees must submit semi-annual reports until graduated to 
annual report status.

Sec. 312.1  Purpose and scope.

    The purpose of this part is to set forth requirements governing the 
extension of assistance under section 304 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 3153). 
Funds obligated to a State shall be available for supplementing or 
making grants authorized under Titles I, III (other than planning grants 
authorized under sections 301(b) and 302), IV, and IX of the Act for 
projects within such States. The Assistant Secretary has notified the 
State of amounts available under section 304, if any, for basic and 
supplemental assistance under this part.


<R05>
Sec. 312.2  Selection and qualification of projects for supplementary assistance.

    The selection of projects to be assisted by the use of funds in 
supplementing grants made by EDA under Titles I and III (other than 
planning grants authorized under sections 301(b) and 302), IV, and IX of 
the Act shall be made by the States and communicated to EDA on forms 
prescribed by EDA. Eligibility of a project for assistance shall be 
determined by EDA incident to the evaluation of the application for the 
underlying basic grant assistance for such project.


<R05>
Sec. 312.3  Selection and qualification of projects for basic grant assistance.

    (a) In those cases where the States propose to use funds for basic 
grant assistance for projects meeting requirements for assistance under 
Titles I and III (other than planning grants authorized under sections 
301(b) and 302), IV, and IX of the Act, and for which funds have been 
determined to be unavailable by EDA under Titles I, III, IV, and IX, the 
States shall communicate the proposed use of the funds to EDA on forms 
prescribed by EDA. A proposal shall contain or be accompanied by the 
documentation or certification evidencing compliance with the 
requirements, conditions, and limitations as would be applicable to such 
project if it were

[[Page 456]]

being considered for funding under Titles I and III (other than planning 
grants authorized under sections 301(b) and 302), IV, and IX of the Act. 
Eligibility and compliance of a project for assistance shall be 
determined by EDA in the same manner as applicable to projects receiving 
only supplementary assistance under section 304 of the Act.
    (b) A proposal by a State for the use of funds for a basic grant 
shall be accompanied by evidence that the principal governing 
authorities for the area in which a project is to be located have 
approved the project.
    (c) Funds may not be used by a State as a grant to a private 
profitmaking entity.


<R05>
Sec. 312.4  Award requirements.

    States must make a contribution which is equal to at least 25 
percent of the funds being made available to a particular project from 
funds appropriated under section 304 of the Act. Participation in or 
contributions to a project by local subdivisions of a State or private 
individuals or organizations shall not be deemed contributions by the 
State as required by this section.


<R05>
Sec. 312.5  Construction management and disbursement.

    Projects assisted through the use of funds in supplementing EDA 
grants under Titles I and III (other than planning grants authorized 
under sections 301(b) and 302), IV, and IX of the Act or in providing 
basic grants shall be subject to the same procedures and requirements 
relating to post-approval compliances, construction management, and 
disbursement as applicable to projects funded under Titles I, III, IV, 
and IX of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 312.6  Conditions for disbursement of funds.

    (a) As a condition for the disbursement of funds, a State shall 
conform to the requirements of the Act and provide acceptable evidence 
of compliance with requirements conditions and limitations applicable to 
projects assisted under Titles I, III (other than planning grants 
authorized under section 301(b) and 302), IV, and IX of the Act. States 
will be promptly notified of proposals which do not meet requirements.
    (b) It shall also be a condition for the disbursement of funds for 
any project that the State must make a showing:
    (1) That such funds will be used in a manner consistent with the 
State planning process assisted under part 307 of this chapter if such a 
planning process has been established;
    (2) That such State is not receiving planning assistance under part 
307 but has an economic development planning process meeting the 
standards required for assistance under part 307 of this chapter and 
that the proposed use of funds is consistent with such planning process; 
or
    (3) That the project is clearly of such nature that EDA may conclude 
that its implementation would not impair the benefits intended to be 
derived from an orderly economic development planning process.

<R04>
                          Subpart A--In General


<R05>
Sec. 314.1  Federal interest, applicability.

    (a) All property that is acquired or improved with EDA grant 
assistance shall be held in trust by the recipient for the benefit of 
the project purposes under which the property was acquired or improved.
    (b) During the estimated useful life of the project, EDA retains an 
undivided equitable reversionary interest in property acquired or 
improved with EDA grant assistance.
    (c) EDA may approve the substitution of an eligible entity for a 
grantee. The original grantee remains responsible for the period it was 
the grantee, and the successor grantee holds the project property with 
the responsibilities of an original grantee under the award.
    (d) The requirements contained in this part apply solely to grant 
and cooperative agreement award projects.


<R05>
Sec. 314.2  Definitions.

    As used in this part 314 of this chapter:
    Dispose includes sell, lease, abandon, or use for a purpose or 
purposes not authorized under the grant award or this part.
    Estimated useful life means that period of years from the time of 
award, determined by EDA as the expected lifespan of the project.
    Grantee includes any recipient, subrecipient, awardee, or subawardee 
of grant assistance under the Public Works and Economic Development Act 
of 1965, or under Title II, Chapter 3 of the Trade Act of 1974, Title I 
of the Public Works Employment Act of 1976, the Public Works Employment 
Act of 1977, or the Community Emergency Drought Relief Act of 1977, and 
any EDA-approved successor to such recipient, subrecipient, awardee or 
subawardee.
    Owner includes fee owner, transferee, lessee, or optionee of real 
property upon which project facilities or improvements are or will be 
located, or real property improved under a project which has as its 
purpose that the property be sold.
    Personal Property means all property other than real property.
    Project means the activity and property acquired or improved for 
which a grant is awarded. When property is used in other programs as 
provided in Sec. 314.3(b), ``project'' includes such programs.
    Property includes all forms of property, real, personal (tangible 
and intangible), and mixed.
    Real property means any land, improved land, structures, 
appurtenances thereto, or other improvements, excluding movable 
machinery and equipment. Improved land also includes land which is 
improved by the construction of such project facilities as roads, 
sewers, and water lines which are not situated directly on the land but 
which contribute to the value of such land as a specific part of the 
project purpose.


<R05>
Sec. 314.3  Use of property.

    (a) The grantee or owner shall use any property acquired or improved 
in whole or in part with grant assistance only for the authorized 
purpose of the project as long as it is needed during the estimated 
useful life of the project and such property shall not be leased, sold, 
disposed of or encumbered without the written authorization of EDA.
    (b) In the event that EDA and the grantee determine that property 
acquired or improved in whole or in part with grant assistance is no 
longer needed for the original grant purpose, it may be used in other 
Federal grant programs, or programs that have purposes consistent with 
those authorized for support by EDA, if EDA approves such use.
    (c) When the authorized purpose of the EDA grant is to develop real 
property to be leased or sold, as determined by EDA, such sale or lease 
is permitted provided the sale is consistent with the authorized purpose 
of the grant and with applicable EDA requirements concerning, but not 
limited to, nondiscrimination and nonrelocation.
    (d) When acquiring replacement personal property of equal or greater 
value, the grantee may trade-in the property originally acquired or sell 
the original property and use the proceeds in the acquisition of the 
replacement property, provided that the replacement property shall be 
used for the

[[Page 458]]

project and be subject to the same requirements as the original 
property.


<R05>
Sec. 314.4  Unauthorized use.

    (a) Except as provided in Sec. 314.3 (b), (c) or (d), whenever, 
during the expected useful life of the project, any property acquired or 
improved in whole or in part with grant assistance is disposed of 
without the approval of EDA, or no longer used for the authorized 
purpose of the project, the Federal Government shall be compensated by 
the grantee for the Federal share of the value of the property; provided 
that for equipment and supplies, the standards of the Uniform 
Administrative Requirements for Grants at 15 CFR part 24 and OMB 
Circular A-110 or any supplements or successors thereto, as applicable, 
shall apply.
    (b) If property is disposed of without approval, EDA may assert its 
interest in the property to recover the Federal share of the value of 
the property for the Federal Government. EDA may pursue its rights under 
both paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, except that the total 
amount to be recovered shall not exceed the Federal share, plus costs 
and interest.


<R05>
Sec. 314.5  Federal share.

    (a) For purposes of this part 314, the Federal share of the value of 
property is that percentage of the current fair market value of the 
property attributable to the EDA participation in the project (after 
deducting actual and reasonable selling and fix-up expenses, if any, 
incurred to put the property into condition for sale).
    (b) Where the grantee's interest in property is a leasehold for a 
term of years less than the depreciable remaining life of the property, 
that factor shall be considered in determining the percentage of the 
Federal share.
    (c) If property is transferred from the grantee to another eligible 
entity, as provided in Sec. 314.1(c), the Federal Government shall be 
compensated the Federal share of any money paid by or on behalf of the 
successor grantee to or for the benefit of the original grantee, 
provided that EDA may first permit the recovery by the original grantee 
of an amount not exceeding its investment in the project nor exceeding 
that percentage of the value of the property that is not attributable to 
the EDA participation in the project.
    (d) When the Federal Government is compensated for the Federal share 
of the value of property acquired or improved in whole or in part with 
grant assistance, EDA has no further interest in the ownership, use or 
disposition of the property.


<R05>
Sec. 314.6  Encumbrances.

    (a) Except as provided in Sec. 314.6(c), grantee-owned property 
acquired or improved in whole or in part with grant assistance may not 
be used to secure a mortgage or deed of trust or otherwise be used as 
collateral or encumbered except to secure a grant or loan made by a 
State or Federal agency or other public body participating in the same 
project.
    (b) Encumbering such property other than as permitted in this 
section is an unauthorized use of the property requiring compensation to 
the Federal Government as provided in Secs. 314.4 and 314.5.
    (c) EDA may waive the provisions of Sec. 314.6(a) for good cause 
when EDA determines all of the following:
    (1) All proceeds from the grant/loan to be secured by the 
encumbrance on the property shall be available only to the grantee, and 
all proceeds from such secured grant/loan shall be used only on the 
project for which the EDA grant was awarded or on related activities of 
which the project is an essential part;
    (2) The lender/grantor would not provide funds without the security 
of a lien on the project property; and
    (3) There is a reasonable expectation that the borrower/grantee will 
not default on its obligation.
    (d) EDA may waive the provisions of Sec. 314.6(a) as to an 
encumbrance on property which is acquired and/or improved by an EDA 
grant when EDA determines that the encumbrance arises solely from the 
requirements of a pre-existing water or sewer facilities or other 
utility encumbrance which by its terms extends to additional property 
connected to such facilities. EDA's determination shall make reference 
to the specific requirements (for example, ``water system and all 
accessions or additions or improvements thereto'') which extend

[[Page 459]]

the terms of the pre-existing encumbrance to the property which is 
acquired and/or improved by the EDA grant.


<R04>
                        Subpart B--Real Property


<R05>
Sec. 314.7  Title.

    (a) The grantee must furnish evidence, satisfactory in form and 
substance to EDA, that title to real property required for a project 
(other than property of the United States) is vested in the grantee, and 
that such easements, rights-of-way, state permits, or long-term leases 
as are required for the project have been or will be obtained by the 
grantee within an acceptable time. EDA may determine that, in lieu of 
title, a long-term leasehold interest for a period not less than the 
estimated useful life of the project will be acceptable, but only if fee 
title is not obtainable and the lease provisions adequately safeguard 
EDA's interest in the project.
    (b) The grantee must disclose to EDA any liens, mortgages, other 
encumbrances, reservations, reversionary interests, or other 
restrictions on title or the grantee's interest in the property. No such 
encumbrance or restriction will be acceptable if, as determined by EDA, 
the encumbrance or restriction will interfere with the construction, 
use, operation or maintenance of the project during its estimated useful 
life.


<R05>
Sec. 314.8  Recorded statement.

    (a) For all projects involving the acquisition, construction or 
improvement of a building, as determined by EDA, the grantee shall 
execute a lien, covenant or other statement of EDA's interest in the 
property acquired or improved in whole or in part with the funds made 
available under the award. The statement shall specify in years the 
estimated useful life of the project and shall include, but not be 
limited to disposition, encumbrance, and compensation of Federal share 
requirements of this part 314. The statement shall be satisfactory in 
form and substance to EDA.
    (b) The statement of EDA's interest must be perfected and placed of 
record in the real property records of the jurisdiction in which the 
property is located, all in accordance with local law.
    (c) Facilities in which the EDA investment is only a small part of a 
large project, as determined by EDA, may be exempted from the 
requirements of this section.

                      Subpart C--Personal Property


<R05>
Sec. 314.9  Recorded statement.

    For all projects which EDA determines involve the acquisition or 
improvement of significant items of tangible personal property, 
including but not limited to ships, machinery, equipment, removable 
fixtures or structural components of buildings, EDA will require the 
grantee to execute a security interest or other statement of EDA's 
interest in the property, acceptable in form and substance to EDA, which

Sec. 314.10  Revolving loan funds.

    (a) With EDA's consent, grantees holding revolving loan fund (RLF) 
property (including but not limited to money, notes, and security 
interests) may sell such property or encumber such property as part of a 
securitization of the RLF portfolio in either case to generate money to 
be used for additional loans as part of the RLF project;
    (b) When a grantee determines that it is no longer necessary or 
desirable to operate an RLF, the RLF may be terminated; provided that, 
unless otherwise stated in the award, the Federal Government shall be 
compensated the Federal share of the value of the RLF property. The 
Federal share shall apply proportionate to the percentage of the 
capitalization of the RLF contributed by EDA to all RLF property 
including the present value of all outstanding loans; provided that the 
grantee may use for other economic development purposes with EDA's 
approval that portion of such RLF property which EDA determines is 
attributable to the payment of interest on RLF loans and not used by the 
grantee for administrative or other allowable expenses.

                      Subpart A--General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 315.1  Purpose and scope.

    The regulations in this part implement certain changes to 
responsibilities of the Secretary of Commerce under Chapter 3 of Title 
II of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2341 et. seq.) (Trade 
Act), concerning adjustment assistance for firms. The statutory 
authority and responsibilities of the Secretary of Commerce relating to 
adjustment assistance are delegated to EDA. EDA has the duties of 
certifying firms as eligible to apply for adjustment assistance, 
providing technical adjustment assistance to eligible recipients, and 
providing assistance to organizations representing trade injured 
industries.


<R05>

    Adjustment assistance is technical assistance provided to firms or 
industries under Chapter 3 of Title II of the Trade Act.
    Adjustment proposal means a certified firm's plan for improving its 
economic situation.
    Certified firm means a firm which has been determined by EDA to be 
eligible to apply for adjustment assistance.
    Confidential business information means information submitted to EDA 
or TAACs by firms that concerns or relates to trade secrets for 
commercial or financial purposes which is exempt from public disclosure 
under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4), 5 U.S.C. 552 b(c)(4) and 15 CFR part 4.

    Firm means an individual proprietorship, partnership, joint venture, 
association, corporation (including a development corporation), business 
trust, cooperative, trustee in bankruptcy or receiver under court decree 
and including fishing, agricultural entities and those which explore, 
drill or otherwise produce oil or natural gas. When a firm owns or 
controls other firms as described below, for purposes of receiving 
benefits under this part, the firm and such other firms may be 
considered a single firm when they produce like or directly competitive 
articles or are exerting essential economic control over one or more 
production facilities. Such other firms include:
    (1) Predecessor;
    (2) Successor;
    (3) Affiliate; or
    (4) Subsidiary.
    A group of workers threatened with total or partial separation means 
there is

[[Page 461]]

reasonable evidence that such total or partial separation is imminent;
    Like articles means articles which are substantially identical in 
their intrinsic characteristics.
    Partial separation means either:
    (1) A reduction in an employee's work hours to 80 percent or less of 
the employee's average weekly hours during the year of such reductions 
as compared to the preceding year; or
    (2) A reduction in the employee's weekly wage to 80 percent or less 
of his/her average weekly wage during the year of such reduction as 
compared to the preceding year.
    Person means individual, organization or group.

    (1) A petition for certification of eligibility to qualify for 
adjustment assistance;
    (2) Any supporting information submitted by the petitioner;

party receiving adjustment assistance or through which adjustment 
assistance is provided under the Trade Act.
    A significant number or proportion of workers means 5 percent of the 
firm's work force or 50 workers, whichever is less. An individual farmer 
is considered a significant number or proportion of workers.
    Substantial interest means a direct, material, economic interest in 
the certification or noncertification of the petitioner.
    Technical Assistance means assistance provided to firms or 
industries under Chapter 3 of Title II of the Trade Act.

<R05>
Sec. 315.3  Confidential business information.

    EDA will follow the procedures set forth in 15 CFR 4.7, and 
submitters should so designate any information they believe 
confidential.


<R05>
Sec. 315.4  Eligible applicants.

    (a) Trade Adjustment Assistance Centers (TAACs) are eligible 
applicants. A TAAC can be:

    (3) Non-profit organization.
    (b) Firms;
    (c) Organizations assisting or representing industries in which a 
substantial number of firms or workers have been certified as eligible 
to apply for adjustment assistance under sections 223 or 251 of the 
Trade Act including the following:
    (1) Existing agencies;
    (2) Private individuals;

    (8) Other non-profit industry organizations.


<R05>
Sec. 315.5  Selection process.

    (a) TAACs are selected in accordance with the following:
    (1) Currently funded TAACs are invited by EDA to submit either new 
or amended applications, provided they have performed in a satisfactory 
manner and complied with previous and/or current conditions in their 
cooperative agreements with EDA and contingent upon availability of 
funds. Such TAACs shall submit an application on a form approved by OMB, 
as well as a proposed budget, narrative scope of work, and such other 
information as requested by EDA. Acceptance of an application or amended 
application for a cooperative agreement does not assure funding by EDA; 
and
    (2) New TAACs will be invited to submit proposals, and if they are 
acceptable, EDA will invite an application on a form approved by OMB. An 
application will be accompanied by a narrative scope of work, proposed 
budget

[[Page 462]]

and such other information as requested by EDA. Acceptance of an 
application does not assure funding by EDA.
    (b) Firms are selected in accordance with the following:
    (1) Firms may apply for certification generally through a TAAC by 
filling out a petition for certification. The TAAC will provide 
technical assistance to firms wishing to fill out such petitions;
    (2) Once firms are certified in accordance with the procedures 
described in Secs. 315.9 and 315.10, an adjustment proposal is usually 
prepared with technical assistance from a party independent of the firm, 
usually the TAAC, and submitted to EDA;
    (3) Certified firms which have submitted acceptable adjustment 
proposals within the time limits described in Sec. 315.13 below, may 
begin implementation of such proposal, generally through the TAAC and 
often with Technical Assistance from the TAAC, by submitting a request 
to the TAAC to provide assistance in implementing an accepted adjustment 
proposal; and
    (4) EDA determines whether or not to provide assistance for 
adjustment proposals based upon Sec. 315.6(c)(2).
    (c) Organizations representing trade injured industries must meet 
with an EDA representative to discuss the industry problems, 
opportunities and assistance needs, and if invited by EDA may then 
submit an application as approved by OMB, as well as a scope of work and 
proposed budget.

[60 FR 49678, Sept. 26, 1995, as amended at 61 FR 7984, Mar. 1, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 315.6  Evaluation criteria.

    (a) Currently funded TAACs are generally evaluated based on the 
following:
    (1) How well they have performed under cooperative agreements with 
EDA and if they are in compliance with the terms and conditions of such 
cooperative agreements;
    (2) Proposed scope of work, budget and application or amended 
application; and
    (3) The availability of funds.
    (b) New TAACs are generally evaluated on the following:
    (1) Demonstrates competence in administering business assistance 
programs;
    (2) Background and experience of staff;
    (3) Proposed scope of work, budget and application; and
    (4) The availability of funding.
    (c) Firms are generally evaluated based on the following:
    (1) For certification, firms' petitions are selected strictly on the 
basis of conformance with requirements set forth in Sec. 315.9 below;
    (2) An adjustment proposal is evaluated on the basis of the 
following:
    (i) The proposal must be submitted to EDA within 2 years after the 
date of the certification of the firm; and
    (ii) The adjustment proposal must include a description of any 
technical assistance requested to implement such proposal including 
financial and other supporting documentation as EDA determines is 
necessary, based upon either:
    (A) An analysis of the firm's problems, strengths and weaknesses and 
an assessment of its prospects for recovery; or
    (B) If EDA so determines, an acceptable adjustment proposal can be 
prepared on the basis of other available information.
    (iii) The adjustment proposal must be evaluated to determine that 
it:
    (A) Is reasonably calculated to contribute materially to the 
economic adjustment of the firm, i.e., that such proposal will be a 
constructive aid to the firm in establishing a competitive position in 
the same or a different industry;
    (B) Gives adequate consideration to the interests of a sufficient 
number of separated workers of the firm, by providing for example that 
the firm will:
    (1) Give a rehiring preference to such workers;
    (2) Make efforts to find new work for a number of such workers; and
    (3) Assist such workers in obtaining benefits under available 
programs.
    (C) Demonstrates that the firm will make all reasonable efforts to 
use its own resources for economic development, though under certain 
circumstances, resources of related firm

[[Page 463]]

or major stockholders will also be considered.
    (d) Organizations representing trade injured industries must 
demonstrate that the industry is injured by increased imports and that 
the activities to be funded will yield some short-term actions that the 
industry itself (and individual firms) can and will take toward the 
restoration of the industry's international competitiveness.
    (1) The emphasis is on practical results that can be implemented in 
the near term, and long-term research and development activities are 
given low priority.
    (2) It is also expected that the industry will continue activities 
on its own without the need for continued Federal assistance.


<R05>
Sec. 315.7  Award requirements.

    (a) Award periods are as follows:
    (1) TAACs are generally funded for 12 months;
    (2) Firms are generally provided assistance over a 2-year period; 
and
    (3) Organizations representing trade injured industries are 
generally funded for 12 months.
    (b) Matching requirements are as follows:
    (1) There are no matching requirements for certification assistance 
provided by the TAACs to firms or for administrative expenses for the 
TAACs;
    (2) All adjustment proposals and implementation assistance must 
include not less than 25% nonfederal match, provided to the extent 
practicable, by firms being assisted; and
    (3) Contributions of at least 50% of the total project cash cost, in 
addition to appropriate in kind contribution, are expected from 
organizations representing trade injured industries.


<R04>
             Subpart B--Trade Adjustment Assistance Centers


<R05>
Sec. 315.8  Purpose and scope.

    (a) Trade Adjustment Assistance Centers (TAACs) are available to 
assist firms in all fifty states, the District of Columbia and the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico in obtaining adjustment assistance. TAACs 
provide technical assistance in accordance with this subpart either 
through their own staffs or by arrangements with outside consultants. 
Information concerning TAACs serving particular areas can be obtained 
from EDA. See the annual FY NOFA for the appropriate point of contact 
and address.
    (b) Prior to submitting a request for technical assistance to EDA, a 
firm should determine the extent to which the required technical 
assistance can be provided through a TAAC. EDA will provide technical 
assistance through TAACs whenever EDA determines that such assistance 
can be provided most effectively in this manner. Requests for technical 
assistance will normally be made through TAACs.
    (c) TAACs generally provide technical assistance to a firm by 
providing the following:
    (1) Assistance to a firm in preparing its petition for 
certification;
    (2) Assistance to a certified firm in diagnosing its strengths and 
weaknesses and developing an adjustment proposal for the firm; and
    (3) Assistance to a certified firm in the implementation of the 
adjustment proposal for the firm.

                    Subpart C--Certification of Firms


<R05>
Sec. 315.9  Certification requirements.

    A firm will be certified eligible to apply for adjustment assistance 
based upon the petition for certification if EDA determines, under 
section 251(c) of the Trade Act, that:
    (a) A significant number or proportion of workers in such firm have 
become totally or partially separated, or are threatened to become 
totally or partially separated.
    (b) Either sales or production, or both of the firm have decreased 
absolutely; or sales or production, or both of any article that 
accounted for not less than 25 percent of the total production or sales 
of the firm during the 12-month period preceding the most recent 12-
month period for which data are available have decreased absolutely; and
    (c) Increases of imports (absolute or relative to domestic 
production) of articles like or directly competitive with

[[Page 464]]

articles produced by such firm contributed importantly to such total or 
partial separation or threat thereof, and to such decline in sales or 
production; provided that imports will not be considered to have 
contributed importantly if other factors were so dominant, acting singly 
or in combination, that the worker separation or threat thereof, or 
decline in sales or production would have been essentially the same 
irrespective of the influence of imports.

deficiencies have been corrected and the resubmission will be treated as 
a new petition.
    (d) A notice of acceptance of a petition shall be published in the 
Federal Register.
    (e) An investigation shall be initiated by EDA to determine whether 
the petitioner meets requirements set forth in section 251(c) of the 
Trade Act and Sec. 315.9 above. The investigation can be terminated at 
any time for failure to meet such requirements. A report of this 
investigation shall become part of the record upon which a determination 
of the petitioner's eligibility to apply for adjustment assistance shall 
be made.
    (f) A petitioner may withdraw a petition for certification if a 
request for withdrawal is received by EDA before a certification 
determination or denial is made. Such firm may submit a new petition at

and Sec. 315.9.
    (g) Following acceptance, EDA shall decide what action to take on 
petitions for certification as follows:
    (1) Make a determination based on the record as soon as possible 
after all material has been submitted. In no event may the period exceed 
60 days from the date on which the petition was accepted; and
    (2) Either certify the petitioner eligible to apply for adjustment 
assistance or deny the petition, and in either event EDA shall promptly 
give notice of the action in writing to the petitioner. A notice to the 
petitioner or any parties requesting notice as specified in 
Sec. 315.10(d) of a denial of a petition shall specify the reasons upon 
which the denial is based. If a petition is denied, the petitioner shall 
not be entitled to resubmit its petition within one year from the date 
of the denial. At the time of the denial of a petition EDA may waive the 
1-year limitation for good cause.

hearing;
    (8) The presiding officer may exclude evidence which s/he deems 
improper or irrelevant. Formal rules of evidence shall not be 
applicable. Documentary material must be of a size consistent with ease

<R05>
Sec. 315.12  Termination of certification and procedure.

    (a) Whenever EDA determines that a certified firm no longer requires 
adjustment assistance or for other good cause, EDA will terminate the 
certification and promptly publish notice of such termination in the 
Federal Register. The termination will take effect on the date specified 
in the Notice.
    (b) EDA shall immediately notify the petitioner and shall state the 
reasons for such termination.


<R05>
Sec. 315.13  Loss of certification benefits.

    A firm may fail to obtain benefits of certification, regardless of 
whether its certification is terminated for any of the following 
reasons:
    (a) Failure to submit an acceptable adjustment proposal within 2 
years after date of certification. While approval of an adjustment 
proposal may occur after the expiration of such 2-year period, an 
acceptable adjustment proposal must be submitted before such expiration;
    (b) Failure to submit documentation necessary to start 
implementation or modify its request for adjustment assistance 
consistent with its adjustment proposal within 6 months after approval 
of the adjustment proposal and 2 years have elapsed since the date of 
certification. If the firm anticipates that a longer period will be 
required to submit documentation, such longer period should be indicated 
in its adjustment proposal. If the firm becomes unable to submit its 
documentation within the allowed time, it should notify EDA in writing 
of the reasons for the delay and submit a new schedule. EDA has the 
discretion to accept or refuse a new schedule;

<R05>
Sec. 316.2  Certification as to waste treatment.

    Whenever the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has established a 
permitting and enforcement system for the regulation and monitoring of 
the design and operation of wastewater treatment plants which is 
delegated to the states for certification, EDA under PWEDA will accept 
such state certifications in lieu of certification by EPA.


<R05>
Sec. 316.3  Excess capacity.

    (a) All projects funded by EDA under PWEDA are subject to section 
702 of PWEDA and EDA shall determine section 702 compliance based on the 
following:
    (1) A section 702 study;
    (2) A section 702 report; or
    (3) A section 702 exemption.
    (b) Definitions. For purposes of this section only:
    Capacity means the maximum amount of a product or service that can 
be supplied to the market area over a sustained period by existing 
enterprises through the use of present facilities and customary work 
schedules for the industry.
    Demand means the actual quantity of a product or service that users 
are willing to purchase for use in the market area served by the 
intended commercial or industrial beneficiary.
    Efficient capacity means that part of capacity derived from the use 
of contemporary structures, machinery and equipment, designs and 
technologies.
    Existing competitive enterprise means an established operation which 
either produces the same product or delivers the same service to all or 
a substantial part of the market area.
    Market Area means the geographic area within which products and/or 
services compete for purchase by customers.
    Primary Beneficiary means one or more firms within the same industry 
which may reasonably be expected to use 50 percent or more of the 
capacity of an EDA-financed facility(ies) in order to expand the supply 
of goods or services sold in competition with other producers or 
suppliers of such goods or services.
    (c) For certain types of EDA projects, a section 702 study of 
competitive impact will be used as a basis for a decision by EDA that 
such project would not violate section 702 of PWEDA. A section 702 study 
is required when either of the following situations exists:
    (1) Where a primary beneficiary is present; or
    (2) When EDA so determines.
    (d) The following procedures shall be followed to the extent 
necessary to provide EDA with sufficient information to prepare a 702 
study:
    (1) The primary beneficiary shall submit as part of the project 
selection process the following information with regard to each product 
or service affected by the project:
    (i) A detailed description;
    (ii) Current and projected amount and value of annual sales;
    (iii) Distribution channel(s) and geographic marketing area; and
    (iv) Name of other suppliers and amount presently available in the 
market area.
    (2) If the primary beneficiary has conducted or commissioned a 
market study supporting the proposed project, such market study shall be 
made available to EDA early in the project selection process for 
verification and possible use by EDA as a basis for the 702 study or 
report.
    (e) A section 702 report (a summary of supply/demand factors) will 
form an acceptable basis on which to make a section 702 compliance 
finding when the characteristics described in paragraph (c) (1) or (2) 
of this section are present and in addition, it is readily apparent that 
the resulting increase in output alleviates a shortage of goods or 
services in the market area.
    (f) EDA will make a blanket finding of compliance with section 702 
of PWEDA for those projects which have one or more of the following 
characteristics:
    (1) The project has no primary beneficiary;
    (2) The beneficiary's projected new or additional annual output is 
less than 1

[[Page 469]]

percent of the last recorded annual output in the market area;
    (3) The project will replace or restore capacity recently destroyed 
by flood, fire, wind, or other natural disaster;
    (4) The project will assure the retention of the physical capacity 
and/or employment;
    (5) The project will replace, rebuild or modernize, within the same 
labor market area, facilities displaced by official governmental action;
    (6) The project assures completion of a project previously assisted 
by EDA where further funding is required because of revised project cost 
estimates, rather than for additional productive capacity;
    (7) When the purpose of research or evaluation grants or cooperative 
agreements is to determine the causes of or to assist in the formulation 
of programs to address, or to provide personnel needed to conduct 
programs concerning unemployment, underemployment, underdevelopment, or 
chronic depression;
    (8) When the purpose of planning grants to state or local 
governments, or regional or area organizations is to fund administrative 
expenses of a planning process or for the preparation of economic 
development plans or programs;
    (9) When a technical assistance grant is not designed to assist a 
specific firm or group of firms or lead directly to expanded productive 
capacity or output of specific goods or services for sale in a 
designated market area; and
    (10) PWIP projects.

<R05>
Sec. 316.4  Nonrelocation.

    (a) General requirements for nonrelocation for funding under PWEDA 
are as follows:
    (1) EDA financial assistance will not be used to assist employers 
who transfer jobs from one commuting area to another. A commuting area 
(``area'') is that area defined by the distance people travel to work in 
the locality of the project receiving EDA financial assistance;
    (2) Every applicant for EDA financial assistance has an affirmative 
duty to inform EDA of any employer who will benefit from such assistance 
who will transfer jobs (not persons) in connection with the EDA grant;
    (3) EDA will determine compliance with this requirement prior to 
grant award based upon information provided by the applicant during the 
project selection process; and
    (4) Each applicant and identified primary beneficiary of EDA 
assistance, which for purposes of this section means an entity providing 
the economic justification for the project, must submit its 
certification of compliance with this section, and other applicable 
information as determined by EDA.
    (b) The nonrelocation requirements stated in paragraph (a) of this 
section shall not apply to businesses which:
    (1) Relocated to the area prior to the date of applicant's request 
for EDA assistance;
    (2) Have moved or will move into the area primarily for reasons 
which have no connection to the EDA assistance;
    (3) Will expand employment in the area where the project is to be 
located substantially beyond employment in the area in which the 
business had originally been located;
    (4) Are relocating from technologically obsolete facilities to be 
competitive;
    (5) Are expanding into the new area by adding a branch, affiliate, 
or subsidiary while maintaining employment levels in the old area or 
areas; or
    (6) Are determined by EDA to be exempt.

distribution of electrical energy; or
    (ii) For the production or transmission of natural, manufactured or 
mixed gas.

not be created, provided the following findings are made:
    (A) EDA determines that project financing is not available from 
private lenders or other Federal agencies on terms which, in the opinion 
of EDA, would permit completion and operation of the project; and
    (B) The Federal or state agency regulating such facility makes one 
of the following determinations:
    (1) There would not be any competition with existing public 
utilities under their jurisdiction in public rate charges; and
    (2) There would be such competition as described in paragraph 
(a)(2)(ii)(B)(1) of this section, but existing public utilities are 
unable or unwilling to meet the increase in demand for such energy.
    (b) Electrical facilities may also be funded if such funds would be 
used for:
    (1) An internal electrical system (system) on the consumer side of 
the distribution metering station, including for example, conductors, 
conduits, structures, switchgear, transformers and other appurtenances; 
provided such system meets the following requirements:
    (i) It is owned by the owner of all or a portion of the facility 
served by such system; and
    (ii) Electricity carried on such system will not be resold.

    (3) Facilities for replacement or expansion of existing public 
utilities when the area served will remain unchanged;
    (4) Otherwise eligible components of projects which generate

modification requests.
    (c) In the event that EDA determines it necessary or desirable to 
take actions to protect or further the interests of EDA in connection 
with loans or guarantees made or evidences of indebtedness purchased, 
EDA may:
    (1) Assign or sell at public or private sale, or otherwise dispose
