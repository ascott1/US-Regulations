                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1
    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, October 1, 1997), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.



[[Page vi]]


Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB 
control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These 
OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable 
recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication 
in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and 
parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

<R04>
     Subpart A--Approval of State Plans and Certification of Grants


<R05>
Sec. 201.2  General.

    The State plan is a comprehensive statement submitted by the State 
agency describing the nature and scope of its program and giving 
assurance that it will be administered in conformity with the specific 
requirements stipulated in the pertinent title of the Act, the 
regulations in subtitle A and this chapter of this title, and other 
applicable official issuances of the Department. The State plan contains 
all information necessary for the Administration to determine whether 
the plan can be approved, as a basis for Federal

[[Page 8]]

financial participation in the State program.

[35 FR 12180, July 29, 1970, as amended at 53 FR 36578, Sept. 21, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 201.3  Approval of State plans and amendments.

    The State plan consists of written documents furnished by the State 
to cover each of its programs under the Act: Old-age assistance (title 
I); aid and services to needy families with children (part A of title 
IV); aid to the blind (title X); aid to the permanently and totally 
disabled (title XIV); or aid to the aged, blind or disabled (title XVI). 
The State may submit the common material on more than one program as an 
integrated plan. However, it must identify the provisions pertinent to 
each title since a separate plan must be approved for each public 
assistance title. A plan submitted under title XVI encompasses, under a 
single plan, the programs otherwise covered by three separate plans 
under titles I, X, and XIV. After approval of the original plan by the 
Administration, all relevant changes, required by new statutes, rules, 
regulations, interpretations, and court decisions, are required to be 
submitted currently so that the Administration may determine whether the 
plan continues to meet Federal requirements and policies.
    (a) Submittal. State plans and revisions of the plans are submitted 
first to the State governor or his designee for review in accordance 
with Sec. 204.1 of this chapter, and then to the regional office. The 
States are encouraged to obtain consultation of the regional staff when 
a plan is in process of preparation or revision.
    (b) Review. Staff in the regional offices are responsible for review 
of State plans and amendments. They also initiate discussion with the 
State agency on clarification of significant aspects of the plan which 
come to their attention in the course of this review. State plan 
material on which the regional staff has questions concerning the 
application of Federal policy is referred with recommendations as 
required to the central office for technical assistance. Comments and 
suggestions, including those of consultants in specified areas, may be 
prepared by the central office for use by the regional staff in 
negotiations with the State agency.
    (c) Action. The Regional Administrator, exercised delegated 
authority to take affirmative action on State plans and amendments 
thereto on the basis of policy statements or precedents previously 
approved by the Administrator. The Administrator retains authority for 
determining that proposed plan material is not approvable, or that a 
previously approved plan no longer meets the requirements for approval, 
except that a final determination of disapproval may not be made without 
prior consultation and discussion by the Administrator with the 
Secretary. The Regional Administrator, or the Administrator formally 
notifies the State agency of the actions taken on State plans or 
revisions.
    (d) Basis for approval. Determinations as to whether State plans 
(including plan amendments and administrative practice under the plans) 
originally meet or continue to meet, the requirements for approval are 
based on relevant Federal statutes and regulations. Guidelines are 
furnished to assist in the interpretation of the regulations.
    (e) Prompt approval of State plans. Pursuant to section 1116 of the 
Act, the determination as to whether a State plan submitted for approval 
conforms to the requirements for approval under the Act and regulations 
issued pursuant thereto shall be made promptly and not later than the 
90th day following the date on which the plan submittal is received in 
the regional office, unless the Regional Administrator, has secured from 
the State agency a written agreement to extend that period.
    (f) Prompt approval of plan amendments. Any amendment of an approved 
State plan may, at the option of the State, be considered as a 
submission of a new State plan. If the State requests that such 
amendment be so considered the determination as to its conformity with 
the requirements for approval shall be made promptly and not later than 
the 90th day following the date on which such a request is received in 
the regional office with respect to an amendment that has been received 
in such office, unless the Regional Administrator, has secured from the 
State

[[Page 9]]

agency a written agreement to extend that period. In absence of request 
by a State that an amendment of an approved State plan shall be 
considered as a submission of a new State plan, the procedures under 
Sec. 201.6 (a) and (b) shall be applicable.
    (g) Effective date. The effective date of a new plan may not be 
earlier than the first day of the calendar quarter in which an 
approvable plan is submitted, and with respect to expenditures for 
assistance under such plan, may not be earlier than the first day on 
which the plan is in operation on a statewide basis. The same applies 
with respect to plan amendments that provide additional assistance or 
services to persons eligible under the approved plan or that make new 
groups eligible for assistance or services provided under the approved 
plan. For other plan amendments the effective date shall be as specified 
in other sections of this chapter.

[35 FR 12180, July 29, 1970, as amended at 39 FR 34542, Sept. 26, 1974; 
42 FR 43977, Sept. 1, 1977; 53 FR 36579, Sept. 21, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 201.4  Administrative review of certain administrative decisions.

    Pursuant to section 1116 of the Act, any State dissatisfied with a 
determination of the Administrator pursuant to Sec. 201.3 (e) or (f) 
with respect to any plan or amendment may, within 60 days after the date 
of receipt of notification of such determination, file a petition with 
the Regional Administrator, asking the Administrator for reconsideration 
of the issue of whether such plan or amendment conforms to the 
requirements for approval under the Act and pertinent Federal 
requirements. Within 30 days after receipt of such a petition, the 
Administrator shall notify the State of the time and place at which the 
hearing for the purpose of reconsidering such issue will be held. Such 
hearing shall be held not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days after 
the date notice of such hearing is furnished to the State, unless the 
Administrator and the State agree in writing on another time. For 
hearing procedures, see part 213 of this chapter. A determination 
affirming, modifying, or reversing the Administrator's original decision 
will be made within 60 days of the conclusion of the hearing. Action 
pursuant to an initial determination by the Administrator described in 
such Sec. 201.3 (e) or (f) that a plan or amendment is not approvable 
shall not be stayed pending the reconsideration, but in the event that 
the Administrator subsequently determines that his original decision was 
incorrect he shall certify restitution forthwith in a lump sum of any 
funds incorrectly withheld or otherwise denied.

[35 FR 12180, July 29, 1970, as amended at 42 FR 43977, Sept. 1, 1977; 
53 FR 36579, Sept. 21, 1988]

Sec. 201.5  Grants.

    To States with approved plans, grants are made each quarter for 
expenditures under the plan for assistance, services, training and 
administration. The determination as to the amount of a grant to be made 
to a State is based upon documents submitted by the State agency 
containing information required under the Act and such other pertinent 
facts, including title IV-A the appropriate Federal share of child 
support collections made by the State, as may be found necessary.
    (a) Form and manner of submittal. (1) Time and place: The estimates 
for public assistance grants for each quarterly period must be forwarded 
to the regional office 45 days prior to the period of the estimate. They 
include a certification of State funds available and a justification 
statement in support of the estimates. A statement of quarterly 
expenditures and any necessary supporting schedules must be forwarded to 
the Department of Health and Human Services, Family Support 
Administration, not later than 30 days after the end of the quarter.
    (2) Description of forms: ``State Agency Expenditure Projection--
Quarterly Projection by Program'' represents the State agency's estimate 
of the total amount and the Federal share of expenditures for 
assistance, services, training, and administration to be made during the 
quarter for each of the public assistance programs under the Act. From 
these estimates the State

[[Page 10]]

and Federal shares of the total expenditures are computed. The State's 
computed share of total estimated expenditures is the amount of State 
and local funds necessary for the quarter. The Federal share is the 
basis for the funds to be advanced for the quarter. The State agency 
must also certify, on this form or otherwise, the amount of State funds 
(exclusive of any balance of advances received from the Federal 
Government) actually on hand and available for expenditure; this 
certification must be signed by the executive officer of the State 
agency submitting the estimate or a person officially designated by him, 
or by a fiscal officer of the State if required by State law or 
regulation. (A form ``Certificate of Availability of State Funds for 
Assistance and Administration during Quarter'' is available for 
submitting this information, but its use is optional.) If the amount of 
State funds (or State and local funds if localities participate in the 
program), shown as available for expenditures is not sufficient to cover 
the State's proportionate share of the amount estimated to be expended, 
the certification must contain a statement showing the source from which 
the amount of the deficiency is expected to be derived and the time when 
this amount is expected to be made available.
    (3) The State agency must also submit a quarterly statement of 
expenditures for each of the public assistance programs under the Act. 
This is an accounting statement of the disposition of the Federal funds 
granted for past periods and provides the basis for making the 
adjustments necessary when the State's estimate for any prior quarter 
was greater or less than the amount the State actually expended in that 
quarter. The statement of expenditures also shows the share of the 
Federal Government in any recoupment, from whatever source, including 
for title IV-A the appropriate share of child support collections made 
by the State, of expenditures claimed in a prior period, and also in 
expenditures not properly subject to Federal financial participation 
which are acknowledged by the State agency, including the share of the 
Federal Government for uncashed and cancelled checks as described at 45 
CFR 201.67 and replacement checks as described at 45 CFR 201.70 in this 
part, or which have been revealed in the course of an audit.
    (b) Review. The State's estimates are analyzed by the regional 
office staff and are forwarded with recommendations as required to the 
central office. The central office reviews the State's estimate, other 
relevant information, and any adjustments to be made for prior periods, 
and computes the grant.
    (c) Grant award. The grant award computation form shows, by program, 
the amount of the estimate for the ensuing quarter, and the amounts by 
which the estimate is reduced or increased because of over- or under-
estimate for the prior quarter and for other adjustments. This form is 
transmitted to the State agency to draw the amount of the grant award, 
as needed, to meet the Federal share of disbursements. The draw is 
through a commercial bank and the Federal Reserve system against a 
continuing letter of credit certified to the Secretary of the Treasury 
in favor of the State payee. A copy of the grant award notice is sent to 
the State Central Information Reception Agency in accord with section 
201 of the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act of 1968.
    (d) Letter of credit payment system. The letter of credit system for 
payment of advances of Federal funds was established pursuant to 
Treasury Department regulations (Circular No. 1075), published in the 
Federal Register on July 11, 1967 (32 FR 10201). The HEW ``Instructions 
to Recipient Organizations for Use of Letter of Credit'' was transmitted 
to all grantees by memorandum from the Assistant Secretary-Comptroller 
on January 15, 1968.
    (e) General administrative requirements. With the following 
exceptions, the provisions of part 74 of this title, establishing 
uniform administrative requirements and cost principles, shall apply to 
all grants made to States under this part:

                             45 CFR Part 74

<R05>
Sec. 201.6  Withholding of payment; reduction of Federal financial participation in the costs of social services and training.

    (a) When withheld. Further payments to a State are withheld in whole 
or in part if the Administrator, after reasonable notice and opportunity 
for hearing to the State agency administering or supervising the 
administration of an approved plan, finds:
    (1) That the plan no longer complies with the provisions of section 
2, 402, 1002, 1402, or 1602 of the Act; or
    (2) That in the administration of the plan there is failure to 
comply substantially with any such provision.
    A question of noncompliance of a State plan may arise from an 
unapprovable change in the approved State plan, the failure of the State 
to change its approved plan to conform to a new Federal requirement for 
approval of State plans, or the failure of the State in practice to 
comply with a Federal requirement, whether or not its State plan has 
been amended to conform to such requirement.
    (b) When the rate of Federal financial participation is reduced. 
Under title I, X, XIV, or XVI (AABD) of the Act, Federal financial 
participation in the costs of social services and training approved at 
the rate of 75 per centum is reduced to 50 per centum if the 
Administrator, after reasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing to 
the State agency, finds:
    (1) That the plan provision under such title for prescribed services 
no longer complies with the Federal requirements with respect to such 
prescribed services; or
    (2) That in the administration of the plan there is a failure to 
comply substantially with such plan provision.
    (c) Information discussions. Hearings with respect to matters under 
paragraph (a) or (b) of this section are generally not called, however, 
until after reasonable effort has been made by the Administration to 
resolve the questions involved by conference and discussion with State 
officials. Formal notification of the date and place of hearing does not 
foreclose further negotiations with State officials.
    (d) Conduct of hearings. For hearing procedures, see part 213 of 
this chapter.
    (e) Notification of withholding. If the Administrator makes a 
finding of noncompliance with respect to a matter under paragraph (a) of 
this section, the State agency is notified that further payments will 
not be made to the State (or, in his discretion, that payments will be 
limited to categories under or parts of the plan not affected by such 
failure), until the Administrator is satisfied that there will no longer 
be any such failure to comply. Until he is so satisfied, no further 
payments will be made to the State (or will be limited to categories 
under or parts of the plan not affected by such failure).
    (f) Notification of reduction in the rate of Federal financial 
participation. If the Administrator makes a finding of noncompliance 
with respect to a matter under paragraph (b) of this section, the State 
agency is notified that further payments will be made to the State at 
the rate of 50 per centum of the costs of services and training, until 
the Administrator is satisfied that there will no longer be any failure 
to comply.

<R05>
Sec. 201.7  Judicial review.

    Any State dissatisfied with a final determination of the Secretary 
pursuant to Sec. 201.4 or Sec. 201.6(a) may, within 60 days after it has 
been notified of such determination, file with the U.S. Court of Appeals 
for the circuit in which such State is located a petition for review of 
such determination. After a copy of the petition is transmitted by the 
clerk of the court to the Secretary, the Secretary thereupon shall file 
in the court the record of proceedings upon which such determination was 
based as provided in section 2112 of title 28, United States Code. The 
court is bound by the Secretary's findings of fact, if supported by 
substantial evidence. The court has jurisdiction to affirm the 
Secretary's decision, or set it aside in whole or in part, or, for good 
cause, to

[[Page 12]]

remand the case for additional evidence. If the case is remanded, the 
Secretary may thereupon make new or modified findings of fact, and may 
modify his previous determination. The Secretary shall certify to the 
court the transcript and record of the further proceedings. The judgment 
of the court is subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United 
States upon certiorari or certification as provided in 28 U.S.C. 1254.

<R05>
Sec. 201.10  Review of State and local administration.

    (a) In order to provide a basis for determining that State agencies 
are adhering to Federal requirements and to the substantive legal and 
administrative provisions of their approved plans, the Administration 
conducts a review of State and local public assistance administration. 
This review includes analysis of procedures and policies of State and 
local agencies and examination of case records of individual recipients.
    (b) Each State agency is required to carry out a continuing quality 
control program primarily covering determination of eligibility in 
statistically selected samples of individual cases. The Service conducts 
a continuing observation of these State systems.
    (c) Adherence to other Federal requirements set forth in the 
pertinent titles of the Act and the regulations in this title is 
evaluated through review of selected case records and aspects of agency 
operations.

<R05>
Sec. 201.11  Personnel merit system review.

    A personnel merit system review is carried out by the Office of 
State Merit Systems of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for 
Administration of the Department. The purpose of the review is to 
evaluate the effectiveness of the State merit system relating to the 
public assistance programs and to determine whether there is compliance 
with Federal requirements in the administration of the merit system 
plan. See part 70 of this title.


<R05>
Sec. 201.12  Public assistance audits.

    (a) Annually, or at such frequencies as are considered necessary and 
appropriate, the operations of the State agency are audited by 
representatives of the Audit Agency of the Department. Such audits are 
made to determine whether the State agency is being operated in a manner 
that:
    (1) Encourages prudent use of program funds, and
    (2) Provides a reasonable degree of assurance that funds are being 
properly expended, and for the purposes for which appropriated and 
provided for under the related Act and State plan, including State laws 
and regulations.
    (b) Reports of these audits are released by the Audit Agency 
simultaneously to program officials of the Department, and to the 
cognizant State officials. These audit reports relate the opinion of the 
Audit Agency on the practices reviewed and the allowability of costs 
audited at the State agency. Final determinations as to actions required 
on all matters reported are made by cognizant officials of the 
Department.


<R05>
Sec. 201.13  Action on audit and review findings.

    (a) If the audit results in no exceptions, the State agency is 
advised by letter of this result. The general course for the disposition 
of proposed exceptions resulting from audits involves the submittal of 
details of these exceptions to the State agency which then has an 
opportunity to concur in the proposed exceptions or to assemble and 
submit additional facts for purposes of clearance. Provision is made for 
the State agency to appeal proposed audit exceptions in which it has not 
concurred and which have not been deleted on the basis of clearance 
material. After consideration of a State agency's appeal by the 
Administrator, the Administration advises the State agency of any 
expenditures in which the Federal Government may not participate and 
requests it to include the amount as adjustments in a subsequent 
statement of expenditures. Expenditures in which it is found the Federal 
Government may not participate and which are not properly adjusted 
through the State's claim will be deducted from

[[Page 13]]

subsequent grants made to the State agency.
    (b) If the Federal or State reviews reveal serious problems with 
respect to compliance with any Federal requirement, the State agency is 
required to correct its practice so that there will be no recurrence of 
the problem in the future.

Sec. 201.15  Deferral of claims for Federal financial participation.

    (a) Scope. Except as otherwise provided, this section applies to all 
claims for Federal financial participation submitted by States pursuant 
to titles I, IV, X, XIV, XVI (AABD), of the Social Security Act.
    (b) Definitions. (1) Deferral Action means the process of suspending 
payment with respect to a claim within the scope of paragraph (a) of 
this section, pending the receipt and analysis of further information 
relating to the allowability of the claim, under the procedures 
specified in this section.
    (2) Deferred claim means a claim within the scope of paragraph (a) 
of this section upon which a deferral action has been taken.
    (c) Procedures. (1) A claim or any portion of a claim for 
reimbursement for expenditures reported on the Quarterly Statement of 
Expenditures shall be deferred only when the Regional Administrator 
believes the claim or a specific portion of the claim is of questionable 
allowability. The deferral action will be taken within 60 days after 
receipt of a Quarterly Statement of Expenditures prepared in accordance 
with instructions issued by the Administration.
    (2) When deferral action is taken on a claim, the Regional 
Administrator or the Administrator will within 15 days send written 
notice to the State identifying the type and amount of the claim and the 
reason for deferral. In the written notice of the deferral action, the 
Regional Administrator or the Administrator will request the State to 
make available for inspection all documents and materials which the 
Regional office then believes necessary to determine the allowability of 
the claim.
    (3) Within 60 days of receipt of the notice of deferral action 
described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section the State shall make 
available to the Regional office, in readily reviewable form, all 
requested documents and materials, or when necessary, shall identify 
those documents and items of information which are not available. If the 
State requires additional time to make the documents and material 
available, it shall upon request be given an additional 60 days.
    (4) The Regional office will normally initiate the review within 30 
days of the date that materials become available for review.
    (5) If the Regional Administrator finds that the documents and 
materials are not in readily reviewable form or that supplemental 
information is required, he will promptly notify the State. The State 
will have 15 days from the date of notification to complete the action 
requested. If the Regional Commissioner or the Administrator finds that 
the documents necessary to determine the allowability of the claim are 
not made available within the allowed time limits, or that the documents 
are not made available in readily reviewable form, he shall promptly 
disallow the claim.
    (6) The Regional Administrator or the Administrator will have 90 
days after all documentation is available in readily reviewable form to 
determine the allowability of the deferred claim. If he is unable to 
complete the review

[[Page 16]]

within the time period the claim will be paid subject to a later 
determination of allowability.
    (7) It is the responsibility of the State agency to establish the 
allowability of a deferred claim.
    (8) The Regional Office or the Administrator will notify the State 
in writing of the decision on the allowability of the deferred claim.
    (9) If a deferred claim is disallowed, the Regional Administrator or 
the Administrator shall advise the State of its right to reconsideration 
pursuant to Sec. 201.14.
    (10) A decision to pay a deferred claim shall not preclude a 
subsequent disallowance as a result of an audit exception or financial 
management review. If a subsequent disallowance should occur, the State, 
upon request shall be granted reconsideration pursuant to Sec. 201.14.

Sec. 201.66  Repayment of Federal funds by installments.

    (a) Basic Conditions. When a State has been reimbursed Federal funds 
for expenditures claimed under titles I, IV-A, X, XIV, XVI (AABD) which 
are later determined to be unallowable for Federal financial 
participation, the State may make repayment of such Federal funds in 
installments provided:
    (1) The amount of the repayment exceeds 2\1/2\ percent of the 
estimated annual State share for the program in which the unallowable 
expenditure occurred as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section; and
    (2) The State has notified the Regional Administrator in writing of 
its intent to make installment repayments. Such notice must be given 
prior to the time repayment of the total was otherwise due.
    (b) Criteria governing installment repayments. (1) The number of 
quarters over which the repayment of the total unallowable expenditures 
will be made will be determined by the percentage the total of such 
repayment is of the estimated State share of the annual expenditures for 
the specific program against which the recovery is made, as follows:

                                                                        
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               Number of

If the State chooses to repay amounts representing higher percentages 
during the early quarters, any corresponding reduction in required 
minimum percentages would be applied first to the last scheduled 
payment, then to the next to the last payment, and so forth as 
necessary.
    (2) The latest State Agency Statement of Financial Plan for AFDC 
submitted by the State shall be used to estimate the State's share of 
annual expenditures for the specific program in which the unallowable 
expenditures occurred. That estimated share shall be the sum of the 
State's share of the estimates (as shown on the latest State Agency 
Statement of Financial Plan for AFDC) for four quarters, beginning with 
the quarter in which the first installment is to be paid.
    (3) In the case of a program terminated by law or by the State, the 
actual State share--rather than the estimate--shall be used for 
determining whether the amount of the repayment exceeds 2\1/2\% of the 
annual State share

[[Page 17]]

for the program. The annual State share in these cases will be 
determined using payments computable for Federal funding as reported for 
the program by the State on its Quarterly Statement of Expenditures 
reports submitted for the last four quarters preceding the date on which 
the program was terminated.
    (4) Repayment shall be accomplished through adjustment in the 
quarterly grants over the period covered by the repayment schedule.
    (5) The amount of the repayment for purpose of paragraphs (a) and 
(b) of this section may not include any amount previously approved for 
installment repayment.
    (6) The repayment schedule may be extended beyond 12 quarterly 
installments if the total repayment amount exceeds 100% of the estimated 
State share of annual expenditures. In these circumstances, the criteria 
in paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) or (3) of this section, as appropriate, 
shall be followed for repayment of the amount equal to 100% of the 
annual State share. The remaining amount of the repayment shall be in 
quarterly amounts not less than those for the 9th through 12th quarters.
    (7) The amount of a retroactive claim to be paid a State will be 
offset against any amounts to be, or already being, repaid by the State 
in installments, under the same title of the Social Security Act. Under 
this provision the State may choose to:
    (i) Suspend payments until the retroactive claim due the State has, 
in fact, been offset; or
    (ii) Continue payments until the reduced amount of its debt 
(remaining after the offset), has been paid in full. This second option 
would result in a shorter payment period. A retroactive claim for the 
purpose of this regulation is a claim applicable to any period ending 12 
months or more prior to the beginning of the quarter in which the 
payment is to be made by the Administration.

Sec. 201.67  Treatment of uncashed or cancelled checks.

    (a) Purpose. This section provides the rules to ensure that States 
refund the Federal portion of uncashed or cancelled (voided) checks 
under titles I, IV-A, X, XIV, and XVI (AABD).
    (b) Definitions. As used in this section--Check means a check or 
warrant that the State or local agency uses to make a payment.
    Cancelled (voided) check means a check issued by the State agency or 
local agency which prior to its being cashed is cancelled (voided) by 
State or local agency action, thus preventing disbursement of funds.
    Uncashed check means a check issued by the State agency or local 
agency which has not been cashed by the payee.
    (c) Refund of Federal financial participation (FFP) for uncashed 
checks--(1) General provisions. If a check remains uncashed beyond a 
period of 180 days from the date it was issued, i.e., the date of the 
check, it will no longer be regarded as an amount expended because no 
funds have actually been disbursed. If the State agency has claimed and 
received FFP for the amount of the uncashed check, it must refund the 
amount of FFP received.
    (2) Report of refund. At the end of each calendar quarter, the State 
agency must identify those checks which remain uncashed beyond a period 
of 180 days after issuance. The State agency must report on the 
Quarterly Statement of Expenditures for that quarter all FFP that it 
received for uncashed checks. Once reported on the Quarterly Statement 
of Expenditures for a quarter, an uncashed check is not to be reported 
on a subsequent Quarterly Statement of Expenditures. If an uncashed 
check is cashed after the refund is made, the State agency may submit a 
new claim for FFP.
    (d) Refund of FFP for cancelled (voided) checks--(1) General 
provisions. If the State agency has claimed and received FFP for the 
amount of a cancelled (voided) check, it must refund the amount of FFP 
received.
    (2) Report of refund. At the end of each calendar quarter, the State 
agency must identify those checks which were cancelled (voided). The 
State

[[Page 18]]

agency must report on the Quarterly Statement of Expenditures for that 
quarter all FFP received by the State agency for these checks. Once 
reported on the Quarterly Statement of Expenditures for a quarter, a 
cancelled (voided) check is not to be reported on a subsequent Quarterly 
Statement of Expenditures.

<R05>
Sec. 201.70  Treatment of replacement checks.

    (a) Purpose. This section provides the rules to ensure States do not 
claim Federal financial participation (FFP) for replacement checks under 
titles I, VI-A, X, XIV XVI (AABD) except under the circumstances 
specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (b) Definitions. As used in this section--
    ``Check'' means a check or warrant that the State or local agency 
uses to make a payment.
    ``Replacement check'' means a check issued by the State or local 
agency to replace an earlier check.
    (c) Claiming of FFP for replacement checks. The State agency may not 
claim FFP for the amount of a replacement check unless:
    (1) It makes no claim for FFP for the earlier check;
    (2) The earlier check has been cancelled (voided) and FFP refunded, 
where claimed, pursuant to 45 CFR 201.67(d); or
    (3) The earlier check has been cashed and FFP has been refunded.
    The State agency shall report the amount of the refund of FFP for 
the earlier check on the Quarterly Statement of Expenditures for the 
quarter no later than the quarter in which the replacement check is 
issued.

cause.
    (2) Although the request need not follow any prescribed form, it 
shall clearly identify the question or questions in dispute and contain 
a full statement of the grantee's position with respect to such question 
or questions, and the pertinent facts and reasons in support of such 
position. The grantee shall attach to his submission a copy of the

[39 FR 34542, Dec. 26, 1974, as amended at 53 FR 36579, Sept. 21, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 205.10  Hearings.

    (a) State plan requirements. A State plan under title I, IV-A, X, 
XIV, or XVI(AABD) of the Social Security Act shall provide for a system 
of hearings under which:
    (1) The single State agency responsible for the program shall be 
responsible for fulfillment of hearing provisions which shall provide 
for:
    (i) A hearing before the State agency, or
    (ii) An evidentiary hearing at the local level with a right of 
appeal to a State agency hearing. Where a State agency adopts a system 
of evidentiary hearings with an appeal to a State agency hearing, it 
may, in some political subdivisions, permit local evidentiary hearings, 
and in others, provide for a single hearing before the State agency. 
Under this requirement hearings shall meet the due process standards set 
forth in the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 
254 (1970) and the standards set forth in this section.
    (2) Hearing procedures shall be issued and publicized by the State 
agency. Such procedures shall provide for a face-to-face hearing or, at 
State option, a hearing by telephone when the applicant or recipient 
also agrees. Under this provision, the State shall assure that the 
applicant or recipient is afforded all rights as specified in this 
section, whether the hearing is face-to-face or by telephone;
    (3) Every applicant or recipient shall be informed in writing at the 
time of application and at the time of any action affecting his claim:

[[Page 21]]

    (i) Of his right to a hearing, as provided in paragraph (a)(5) of 
this section;
    (ii) Of the method by which he may obtain a hearing;
    (iii) That he may be represented by an authorized representative, 
such as legal counsel, relative, friend, or other spokesman, or he may 
represent himself.
    (4) In cases of intended action to discontinue, terminate, suspend 
or reduce assistance or to change the manner or form of payment to a 
protective, vendor, or two-party payment under Sec. 234.60:
    (i) The State or local agency shall give timely and adequate notice, 
except as provided for in paragraphs (a)(4) (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this 
section. Under this requirement:
    (A) Timely means that the notice is mailed at least 10 days before 
the date of action, that is, the date upon which the action would become 
effective;
    (B) Adequate means a written notice that includes a statement of 
what action the agency intends to take, the reasons for the intended 
agency action, the specific regulations supporting such action, 
explanation of the individual's right to request an evidentiary hearing 
(if provided) and a State agency hearing, the circumstances under which 
assistance is continued if a hearing is requested, and if the agency 
action is upheld, that such assistance must be repaid under title IV-A, 
and must also be repaid under titles I, X, XIV or XVI (AABD) if the 
State plan provides for recovery of such payments.
    (ii) The agency may dispense with timely notice but shall send 
adequate notice not later than the date of action when:
    (A) The agency has factual information confirming the death of a 
recipient or of the AFDC payee when there is no relative available to 
serve as new payee;
    (B) The agency receives a clear written statement signed by a 
recipient that he no longer wishes assistance, or that gives information 
which requires termination or reduction of assistance, and the recipient 
has indicated, in writing, that he understands that this must be the 
consequence of supplying such information;
    (C) The recipient has been admitted or committed to an institution, 
and further payments to that individual do not qualify for Federal 
financial participation under the State plan;
    (D) The recipient has been placed in skilled nursing care, 
intermediate care or long-term hospitalization;
    (E) The claimant's whereabouts are unknown and agency mail directed 
to him has been returned by the post office indicating no known 
forwarding address. The claimant's check must, however, be made 
available to him if his whereabouts become known during the payment 
period covered by a returned check;
    (F) A recipient has been accepted for assistance in a new 
jurisdiction and that fact has been established by the jurisdiction 
previously providing assistance;
    (G) An AFDC child is removed from the home as a result of a judicial 
determination, or voluntarily placed in foster care by his legal 
guardian;
    (H) For AFDC, the agency takes action because of information the 
recipient furnished in a monthly report or because the recipient has 
failed to submit a complete or a timely monthly report without good 
cause. (See Sec. 233.37);
    (I) A special allowance granted for a specific period is terminated 
and the recipient has been informed in writing at the time of initiation 
that the allowance shall automatically terminate at the end of the 
specified period;
    (J) The agency has made a presumption of mismanagement as a result 
of a recipient's nonpayment of rent and provides for post hearings in 
such circumstances;
    (K) An individual's payment is suspended or reduced for failure to 
meet a payment after performance obligation as set forth at 
Sec. 233.101(b)(2)(iv) (B) or (C) of this chapter. In addition to the 
contents set forth in paragraph (a)(4)(i)(B) of this section, the 
adequate notice must advise the individual of the right to have 
assistance immediately reinstated retroactive to the date of action at 
the previous month's level pending the hearing decision if he or she 
makes a request for a hearing

[[Page 22]]

and reinstatement within 10 days after the date of the notice.
    (iii) When changes in either State or Federal law require automatic 
grant adjustments for classes of recipients, timely notice of such grant 
adjustments shall be given which shall be ``adequate'' if it includes a 
statement of the intended action, the reasons for such intended action, 
a statement of the specific change in law requiring such action and a 
statement of the circumstances under which a hearing may be obtained and 
assistance continued.
    (iv) When the agency obtains facts indicating that assistance should 
be discontinued, suspended, terminated, or reduced because of the 
probable fraud of the recipient, and, where possible, such facts have 
been verified through collateral sources, notice of such grant 
adjustment shall be timely if mailed at least five (5) days before 
action would become effective.
    (5) An opportunity for a hearing shall be granted to any applicant 
who requests a hearing because his or her claim for financial assistance 
(including a request for supplemental payments under Secs. 233.23 and 
233.27) is denied, or is not acted upon with reasonable promptness, and 
to any recipient who is aggrieved by any agency action resulting in 
suspension, reduction, discontinuance, or termination of assistance, or 
determination that a protective, vendor, or two-party payment should be 
made or continued. A hearing need not be granted when either State or 
Federal law requires automatic grant adjustments for classes of 
recipients unless the reason for an individual appeal is incorrect grant 
computation.
    (i) A request for a hearing is defined as a clear expression by the 
claimant (or his authorized representative acting for him), to the 
effect that he wants the opportunity to present his case to higher 
authority. The State may require that such request be in written form in 
order to be effective;
    (ii) The freedom to make such a request shall not be limited or 
interfered with in any way. The agency may assist the claimant to submit 
and process his request;
    (iii) The claimant shall be provided reasonable time, not to exceed 
90 days, in which to appeal an agency action;
    (iv) Agencies may respond to a series of individual requests for 
hearing by conducting a single group hearing. Agencies may consolidate 
only cases in which the sole issue involved is one of State or Federal 
law or policy or changes in State or Federal law. In all group hearings, 
the policies governing hearings must be followed. Thus, each individual 
claimant shall be permitted to present his own case or be represented by 
his authorized representative;
    (v) The agency may deny or dismiss a request for a hearing where it 
has been withdrawn by the claimant in writing, where the sole issue is 
one of State or Federal law requiring automatic grant adjustments for 
classes of recipients, where a decision has been rendered after a WIN 
hearing before the manpower agency that a participant has, without good 
cause, refused to accept employment or participate in the WIN program, 
or has failed to request such a hearing after notice of intended action 
for such refusal, or where it is abandoned. Abandonment may be deemed to 
have occurred if the claimant, without good cause therefor, fails to 
appear by himself or by authorized representative at the hearing 
scheduled for such claimant.
    (6) If the recipient requests a hearing within the timely notice 
period:
    (i) Assistance shall not be suspended, reduced, discontinued or 
terminated (but is subject to recovery by the agency if its action is 
sustained), until a decision is rendered after a hearing, unless:
    (A) A determination is made at the hearing that the sole issue is 
one of State or Federal law or policy, or change in State or Federal law 
and not one of incorrect grant computation;
    (B) A change affecting the recipient's grant occurs while the 
hearing decision is pending and the recipient fails to request a hearing 
after notice of the change;
    (C) The recipient specifically requests that he or she not receive 
continued assistance pending a hearing decision; or
    (D) The agency has made a presumption of mismanagement as a result 
of a recipient's nonpayment of rent and

[[Page 23]]

provides for the opportunity for a hearing after the manner or form of 
payment has been changed for such cases in accordance with Sec. 234.60 
(a)(2) and (a)(11).
    (ii) The agency shall promptly inform the claimant in writing if 
assistance is to be discontinued pending the hearing decision; and
    (iii) In any case where the decision of an evidentiary hearing is 
adverse to the claimant, he shall be informed of and afforded the right 
to make a written request, within 15 days of the mailing of the 
notification of such adverse decision, for a State agency hearing and of 
his right to request a de novo hearing. Unless a de novo hearing is 
specifically requested by the appellant, the State agency hearing may 
consist of a review by the State agency hearing officer of the record of 
the evidentiary hearing to determine whether the decision of the 
evidentiary hearing officer was supported by substantial evidence in the 
record. Assistance shall not be continued after an adverse decision to 
the claimant at the evidentiary hearing.
    (7) A State may provide that a hearing request made after the date 
of action (but during a period not in excess of 10 days following such 
date) shall result in reinstatement of assistance to be continued until 
the hearing decision, unless (i) the recipient specifically requests 
that continued assistance not be paid pending the hearing decision; or 
(ii) at the hearing it is determined that the sole issue is one of State 
or Federal law or policy. In any case where action was taken without 
timely notice, if the recipient requests a hearing within 10 days of the 
mailing of the notice of the action, and the agency determines that the 
action resulted from other than the application of State or Federal law 
or policy or a change in State or Federal law, assistance shall be 
reinstated and continued until a decision is rendered after the hearing, 
unless the recipient specifically requests that continued assistance not 
be paid pending the hearing decision.
    (8) The hearing shall be conducted at a reasonable time, date, and 
place, and adequate preliminary written notice shall be given.
    (9) Hearings shall be conducted by an impartial official (officials) 
or designee of the agency. Under this requirement, the hearing official 
(officials) or designee shall not have been directly involved in the 
initial determination of the action in question.
    (10) When the hearing involves medical issues such as those 
concerning a diagnosis, an examining physician's report, or a medical 
review team's decision, a medical assessment other than that of the 
person or persons involved in making the original decision shall be 
obtained at agency expense and made part of the record if the hearing 
officer considers it necessary.
    (11) In respect to title IV-C, when the appeal has been taken on the 
basis of a disputed WIN registration requirement, exemption 
determination or finding of failure to appear for an appraisal 
interview, a representative of the local WIN manpower agency shall, 
where appropriate, participate in the conduct of the hearing.
    (12) The hearing shall include consideration of:
    (i) An agency action, or failure to act with reasonable promptness, 
on a claim for financial assistance, which includes undue delay in 
reaching a decision on eligibility or in making a payment, refusal to 
consider a request for or undue delay in making an adjustment in 
payment, and discontinuance, termination or reduction of such 
assistance;
    (ii) Agency decision regarding:
    (A) Eligibility for financial assistance in both initial and 
subsequent determinations,
    (B) Amount of financial assistance or change in payments,
    (C) The manner or form of payment, including restricted or 
protective payments, even though no Federal financial participation is 
claimed.
    (13) The claimant, or his representative, shall have adequate 
opportunity:
    (i) To examine the contents of his case file and all documents and 
records to be used by the agency at the hearing at a reasonable time 
before the date of the hearing as well as during the hearing;
    (ii) At his option, to present his case himself or with the aid of 
an authorized representative;
    (iii) To bring witnesses;

[[Page 24]]

    (iv) To establish all pertinent facts and circumstances;
    (v) To advance any arguments without undue interference;
    (vi) To question or refute any testimony or evidence, including 
opportunity to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses.
    (14) Recommendations or decisions of the hearing officer or panel 
shall be based exclusively on evidence and other material introduced at 
the hearing. The transcript or recording of testimony and exhibits, or 
an official report containing the substance of what transpired at the 
hearing, together with all papers and requests filed in the proceeding, 
and the recommendation or decision of the hearing officer or panel shall 
constitute the exclusive record and shall be available to the claimant 
at a place accessible to him or his representative at a reasonable time.
    (15) Decisions by the hearing authority shall:
    (i) In the event of an evidentiary hearing, consist of a memorandum 
decision summarizing the facts and identifying the regulations 
supporting the decision;
    (ii) In the event of a State agency de novo hearing, specify the 
reasons for the decision and identify the supporting evidence and 
regulations.

Under this requirement no persons who participated in the local decision 
being appealed shall participate in a final administrative decision on 
such a case.
    (16) Prompt, definitive, and final administrative action shall be 
taken within 90 days from the date of the request for a hearing.
    (17) The claimant shall be notified of the decision in writing and, 
to the extent it is available to him, of his right to appeal to State 
agency hearing or judicial review.
    (18) When the hearing decision is favorable to the claimant, or when 
the agency decides in favor of the claimant prior to the hearing, the 
agency shall promptly make corrective payments retroactively to the date 
the incorrect action was taken.
    (19) All State agency hearing decisions shall be accessible to the 
public (subject to provisions of safeguarding public assistance 
information).
    (b) Federal financial participation. Federal financial participation 
is available for the following items:
    (1) Payments of assistance continued pending a hearing decision.
    (2) Payments of assistance made to carry out hearing decisions, or 
to take corrective action after an appeal but prior to hearing, or to 
extend the benefit of a hearing decision or court order to others in the 
same situation as those directly affected by the decision or order. Such 
payments may be retroactive in accordance with applicable Federal 
policies on corrective payments.
    (3) Payments of assistance within the scope of Federally aided 
public assistance programs made in accordance with a court order.
    (4) Administrative costs incurred by the agency for:
    (i) Providing transportation for the claimant, his representative 
and witnesses to and from the place of the hearing;
    (ii) Meeting other expenditures incurred by the claimant in 
connection with the hearing;
    (iii) Carrying out the hearing procedures, including expenses of 
obtaining an additional medical assessment.

Sec. 205.32  Procedures for issuance of replacement checks.

    (a) State plan requirements. A State plan under title IV-A of the 
Social Security Act shall provide that (1) procedures are in effect to 
ensure that no undue delays occur in issuing a replacement check; and 
(2) when applicable, prior to the issuance of a replacement check, the 
State agency must:
    (i) Issue a stop payment order on the original AFDC check through 
appropriate banking procedures; and
    (ii) Require recipients to execute a signed statement attesting to 
the nonreceipt, loss, or theft of the original FDC check. However, if 
obtaining such a statement from the recipient will cause the issuance of 
the check to be unduly delayed, the statement may be obtained within a 
reasonable time after the check is issued.
    (b) State option. A State plan may provide that as a condition for 
issuance of a replacement check, a recipient is required to report a 
lost or stolen AFDC check to the police or other appropriate 
authorities. Under this provision, the State agency may require that the 
recipient verify that a report was made to the police or other 
appropriate authorities and, if so, the agency will establish procedures 
for such verification.

Sec. 205.37  Responsibilities of the Administration for Children and Families (ACF).

    (a) ACF shall not approve the initial and annually updated advance 
automatic data processing planning document unless the document, when 
implemented, will carry out the requirements of the law and the 
objectives of title IV-A (AFDC) Automated Application Processing and 
Information Retrieval System Guide. The initial advance automatic data 
processing planning document must include:
    (1) A requirements analysis, including consideration of the program 
mission, functions, organization, services, constraints and current 
support relating to such system;

[[Page 27]]

    (2) A description of the proposed statewide management system, 
including the description of information flows, input data formats, 
output reports and uses;
    (3) The security and interface requirements to be employed in such 
statewide management system;
    (4) A description of the projected resource requirements including 
staff and other needs; and the resources available or expected to be 
available to meet these requirements;
    (5) A cost benefit analysis of alternative systems designs, data 
processing services and equipment in terms of qualitative and 
quantitative measures. The alternative systems considered should include 
the advantages of the proposed system over the alternatives and should 
indicate the period of time the system will be operated to justify the 
funds invested. ACF certified systems that are already in place in other 
States must be included in the alternatives to be considered and 
evaluated;
    (6) A plan for distribution of costs, containing the basis for 
rates, both direct and indirect, to be in effect under such a statewide 
management system;
    (7) An implementation plan with charts of development events, 
testing description, proposed acceptance criteria, and backup and 
fallback procedures to handle possible failure of a system; and
    (8) Evidence that the State's system will be compatible with those 
of the FSA to facilitate the exchange of data between the State and 
Federal system.
    (b) ACF shall on a continuing basis, review, assess, and inspect the 
planning, design, and operation of, statewide management information 
systems, with a view to determining whether, and to what extent, these 
systems meet and continue to meet the requirements under these 
regulations.
    (c) If ACF finds that any statewide management information system 
referred to in Sec. 205.38 fails to comply substantially with criteria, 
requirements, and other undertakings prescribed by the approved advance 
automatic data processing planning document, approval of such document 
shall be suspended. The State will be given written notice of the 
suspension. The notice of suspension will state the reason for the 
suspension, whether the suspended system complies with the criteria for 
50 percent FFP under 45 CFR part 95, the actions required for future 
Federal funding, and the effective date of the suspension. The 
suspension shall be effective as of the date that the system failed to 
comply substantially with the approved APD. The suspension shall remain 
in effect until ACF makes a determination that such system complies with 
prescribed criteria, requirements, and other undertakings for future 
Federal funding. Should a State cease development of their approved 
system, either by voluntary withdrawal or as a result of Federal 
suspension, all Federal incentive funds invested to date that exceed the 
normal administrative FFP rate (50 percent) will be subject to 
recoupment.
    (d) ACF shall provide technical assistance to States as is deemed 
necessary to assist States to plan, design, develop, or install and 
provide for the security of the management information systems.
    (e) Approvals of the systems by ACF under the provisions of this 
section will be undertaken only as a result of State applications for 
increased matching. The requirements of 45 CFR part 95, subpart E and 
subpart F apply.

Sec. 205.38  Federal financial participation (FFP) for establishing a statewide mechanized system.

    (a) Effective July 1, 1981 through March 31, 1994, FFP is available 
at 90 percent of expenditures incurred for planning, design, development 
or installation of a statewide automated application processing and 
information retrieval system which are consistent with an approved ADP. 
(Beginning April 1, 1994 the match rate available for development of 
title IV-A automated systems is 50 percent.) The 90 percent FFP includes 
the purchase or rental of computer equipment and software directly 
required for and used in the operation of this system.
    (b) ACF will approve the system provided the following conditions 
are met--

[[Page 28]]

    (1) ACF determines that the system is likely to provide more 
efficient, economical, and effective administration of the AFDC program.
    (2) The system is compatible with the claims processing and 
information retrieval systems used in the administration of State plans 
approved under title XIX, and State programs where there is FFP under 
title XX.
    (3) The system meets the requirements referred to in Sec. 205.36.
    (4) The system meets criteria established in the title IV-A (AFDC) 
Automated Application Processing and Information Retrieval System Guide 
issued by ACF and which provides specific standard requirements for 
major functions, such as automated eligibility determination, grant 
computation, verification, referral, management control, compability, 
and data security.
    (5) The State agency certifies that--
    (i) The State will have all ownership rights in software or 
modifications thereof and associated documentation designed or developed 
with 90 percent FFP under this section, except that the Department of 
Health and Human Services reserves a royalty-free, nonexclusive, and 
irrevocable license to reproduce, publish, or otherwise use, and to 
authorize others to use for Federal government purposes, such software, 
modifications, and documentation;
    (ii) Methods and procedures for properly charging the cost of all 
systems whether acquired from public or private sources shall be in 
accordance with Federal regulations in part 74 of this title and the 
applicable ACF title IV-A (AFDC) Automated Application Processing and 
Information Retrieval System Guide;
    (iii) The complete system planned, designed, developed, installed, 
and hardware acquired, with FFP under these regulations will be used for 
a period of time which is consistent with the advance planning document 
as approved, or which ACF determines is sufficient to justify the 
Federal funds invested;
    (iv) Information in the system will be safeguarded in accordance 
with applicable Federal law; and
    (v) Access to the system in all of its aspects, including design, 
development, and operation, including work performed by any source, and 
including cost records of contractors and subcontractors, shall be made 
available to the Federal Government by the State at intervals deemed 
necessary by ACF to determine whether the conditions for approval are 
being met and to determine its efficiency, economy and effectiveness.
    (c) If ACF suspends approval, as described in Sec. 205.37, of the 
advance automated data processing planning document and/or system, FFP 
at the higher matching rate shall not be allowed for any costs incurred, 
until such time as the conditions for approval are met. Should the State 
fail to correct the deficiencies which led to the suspension within 90 
days of the date of notification of suspension or within a longer period 
of time agreed to by both the State and ACF, all Federal incentive funds 
invested to date that exceed the normal administrative FFP rate (50 
percent) will be disallowed.
    (d) Should a State voluntarily withdraw its approved APD and cease 
development of the approved system, all Federal incentive funds invested 
to date that exceed the normal administrative FFP rate (50 percent) will 
be disallowed.
    (e) Once a State is certified as having met the requirements 
referred to in Sec. 205.36 incentive funding will not be allowable for 
enhancements or other modifications unless these modifications are 
authorized by the Administation for Children and Families as a result of 
Federal legislative or regulatory change.

Sec. 205.41  Sampling plan and procedures.

    (a) Purpose. This section provides the sampling plan, sample size 
requirements, and procedures for the AFDC and Adult assistance programs.
    (b) Definitions. In addition to the definitions in Sec. 205.40(b), 
the following definitions apply to this section.
    (1) Completed active case review means a case has been subject to QC 
review and for which a finding of correctly paid, overpaid, underpaid or 
ineligible has been made.
    (2) Completed negative case action review means a negative case 
action that has been subject to QC review and for which a finding that 
the action to deny, terminate or suspend assistance is correct or 
incorrect has been made.
    (c) Plan approval and submittal dates. (1) The State shall submit to 
the Department for approval a QC sampling plan (or revisions to a 
current plan) that meets the requirements of this section at least 60 
calendar days before the beginning of the annual sample period in which 
it is to be implemented. The State is not required to resubmit a plan 
which is unchanged from a previous sample period.
    (2) Universe estimates (i.e., average monthly caseload and total 
number of negative case actions) and sample intervals for the annual 
period are required 30 calendar days prior to the selection of the 
October sample.
    (3) The reliability waiver statement for AFDC active cases, as 
described in

[[Page 31]]

paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, is required by the first day of 
the annual sample period.
    (4) The monthly list of selected sample cases, computer-generated 
random start and seed numbers, and reserve pool cases (if applicable) 
are to be submitted within 10 calendar days after the date of sample 
selection specified in the State sampling plan.
    (d) Plan requirements. The State shall have an approved sampling 
plan in effect for the full annual sample period that includes the 
following:
    (1) Population to be sampled;
    (2) List(s) from which the sample is selected, describing the 
following characteristics:
    (i) Sources;
    (ii) Components;
    (iii) Accuracy and completeness of the list(s) in relation to the 
population of interest. The list of active cases shall be an 
unduplicated list of all assistance units for which either a full or 
partial payment was made or authorized for the review month by the end 
of that month. The list of negative case actions shall be a list of all 
completed actions taken by the State to deny, terminate or suspend 
financial assistance for the review month, except for those assistance 
units that are on the active case list for the same review month;
    (iv) Form and structure of the list (e.g., all or part is automated; 
supplemental lists are added; code definitions are used);
    (v) Frequency of updating the list or its sources;
    (vi) Estimated proportion of cases for which a review may not be 
completed; and
    (vii) Methods of deleting listed-in-error cases from the list.
    (3) Sample size (the number to be completed). The AFDC and the Adult 
assistance sample sizes for the annual sample period shall be determined 
in accordance with the requirements in this section. The active case 
samples shall be based on the estimated average monthly caseload for the 
annual sample period. The negative case action samples shall be based on 
the estimated total number of negative case actions for the annual 
sample period.
    (i) AFDC active cases--standard sample size. The required standard 
sample sizes for AFDC completed active case reviews for specified 
estimated average monthly caseloads shall be as follows:

    (ii) AFDC active cases--minimum sample size. A State may choose to 
reduce its sample size for AFDC completed active case reviews below the 
standard size only before the beginning of the annual sample period. For 
each annual period where the State chooses to reduce its standard sample 
size, the State shall provide the Department with a statement (see 
Appendix to this section) as an addendum to the sampling plan, accepting 
the precision of the payment error rate produced by the reduced sample 
size and waiving the right to challenge the precision of the resulting 
AFDC (and Medicaid) error rates based on this reduction. The required 
minimum sample sizes for AFDC completed active case reviews for 
specified estimated average monthly caseloads shall be as follows:

Guam and the Virgin Islands.....................................     150
Puerto Rico.....................................................   (\1\)
                                                                        
\1\ 300+0.02625 (N-10,000), where N is the estimated average monthly    
  caseload.                                                             

    (v) Adult active cases--minimum sample size. The minimum annual 
sample sizes required for completed active Adult assistance case reviews 
shall be as follows:

                                                                        
                                                                        
                                                                        
Guam and the Virgin Islands.....................................      75
Puerto Rico.....................................................   (\1\)
                                                                        
\1\ 300+0.01125 (N-10,000), where N is the estimated average monthly    
  caseload.                                                             

    (vi) Adult negative case action sample size. The required annual 
sample size for completed Adult assistance negative case action reviews 
shall be the same as specified for AFDC negative case action cases in 
paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section.
    (4) Sample selection procedure. The procedure for sample selection 
shall conform to principles of probability sampling. Approximately one-
twelfth of the annual sample shall be selected each month. A separate 
sample shall be selected for active cases and negative case actions.
    (i) The active case sample shall be selected from a list of all 
active cases with payments made or authorized for the review month by 
the end of that month.
    (ii) The negative case action sample shall be selected from a 
combined list of denied applications and terminated and suspended cases. 
The list of denied applications shall consist of all actions taken to 
deny, or otherwise dispose of, applications during the review month. The 
list of terminations and suspensions shall consist of all actions in 
which the case first failed to appear on the regular payroll listing for 
the review month. Multiple actions (by the same applicant) denied in the 
same month are separate actions, and each shall be subject to sample 
selection.
    (iii) States shall select their samples using the systematic random 
sampling method or an alternative sampling method with equivalent 
precision. The alternative sampling method shall be approved by the 
appropriate Federal regional office before implementation, contingent on 
a full description of the method and documentation of an acceptable 
audit trail and ``proof of sampling''.
    (5) Option to drop or compete certain active cases. The State shall 
specify in its sampling plan whether it chooses to drop or complete an 
active sample case for which less than six months have elapsed since it 
was last selected and reviewed, regardless of annual sample period. If 
the State chooses to drop these duplicate cases, the sampling plan shall 
specify the exact method by which these cases are identified and 
dropped.
    (6) Procedure to correct for over- or undersampling. States shall 
evaluate their caseload estimates during the annual sample period to 
ensure that the required number of case reviews is completed. A change 
in the caseload estimate may require an adjustment to the sample size. 
Undersampling shall be corrected during the annual sampling period. 
Oversampling may be corrected at the State's option and, if exercised, 
shall be coordinated with the Federal regional office. When correcting 
for over- or undersampling, the State shall follow the procedures 
described in QC Manual, section 2.
    (e) Review of State sampling procedures. In order for the Department 
to carry out its responsibilities under Sec. 201.10 of this chapter, the 
State shall fully document and make available for review by the 
Department all sampling procedures, including construction and content 
of the universe and sample lists.

Sec. 205.42  Case review and management requirements.

    (a) Purpose. Except for paragraphs (g), (h) and (i) of this section, 
which apply only to AFDC, this section establishes the rules and 
procedures for the conduct of QC case reviews, completion of QC sample 
cases and the determination of whether an error exists in a sample case 
in the AFDC and Adult assistance programs.
    (b) Review basis. The review shall be conducted against permissible 
State practice, except as follows:
    (1)(i) Where a State plan provision(s) is approved incorrectly and 
is inconsistent with Federal law or regulations, the review shall be 
conducted against the approved State plan until either an amendment to 
remove the inconsistency is submitted or six months have elapsed since 
receipt by the State of a dated written notification from the Assistant 
Secretary for Children and Families, the Regional Administrator, or 
either's designee, of the inconsistency(ies), whichever occurs earlier. 
If the plan amendment is submitted within six months, the review shall 
be conducted against the submitted plan amendment. If the plan amendment 
is not approved by the Department or is not submitted within six months, 
sample cases selected for the review month immediately following the 
date that disapproval becomes final or the six-month period, whichever 
occurs earlier, shall be reviewed against applicable Federal law and 
regulations until the State has an amendment approved.
    (ii) Where a State implements a pending plan amendment which is 
subsequently disapproved by the Department, the review shall be 
conducted against the pending plan amendment until disapproval becomes 
final. Sample cases selected for the review month immediately following 
the date that disapproval becomes final shall be reviewed against the 
prior approved plan if it is consistent with Federal law and 
regulations. If the prior approved plan is inconsistent with Federal law 
and regulations, the review shall be conducted against applicable 
Federal law and regulations until the State has submitted and had 
approved a plan amendment. A final disapproval here, and at paragraph 
(b)(1)(i) of this section, means the decision issued by the Assistant 
Secretary for Children and Families if the State requests a hearing 
pursuant to part 201; otherwise a final disapproval means the decision 
issued by the Regional Administrator.
    (iii) If it is necessary for a State to enact a law in order to 
remove an inconsistency, the State must submit the proposed law change 
for enactment no later than the next scheduled legislative session 
immediately following written notification, pursuant to paragraph 
(b)(1)(i) of this section, and shall notify the Department. The 
Department shall establish in writing a reasonable period of time, on a 
case-by-case basis, for the State to enact the law and amend its State 
plan. The review shall continue to be conducted against the State's 
current plan during this time period.
    (2) Where the State makes payment in compliance with a court order, 
the review shall be conducted against the provisions of the court order.
    (c) Case review requirements. (1) The State shall review all cases 
selected in the active and negative case samples as prescribed in 
Sec. 205.41 of this part and reach a review finding as required on each 
case.
    (2) The review shall include: an examination and analysis of the 
case record; the conduct of a field investigation with a face-to-face 
interview in all cases in the active case sample (unless paragraph 
(c)(3) of this section applies) and, as necessary, in the negative case 
action sample; the verification and documentation of all required review 
elements through contacts with appropriate collateral sources of 
information; the securing of specified primary or secondary evidence; a 
determination of the correctness of the eligibility and payment 
decisions; and, where required, transmission of the coded findings to a 
designated host computer.
    (3) A face-to-face interview with a recipient shall not be required 
if the recipient lives in an isolated area not reachable by regularly 
scheduled commercial air service, other public transportation, or 
automobile. For these cases, the State shall document why the interview 
cannot be held in another location convenient to both parties.

[[Page 35]]

The State shall also make at least one attempt to contact the recipient 
to obtain statements regarding factors of eligibility and payment. If a 
case is exempted from a face-to-face interview under this section, the 
QC review shall be completed through the case file information and 
collateral contacts as provided by QC policy and procedures. Exceptions 
to the face-to-face interview requirements shall be determined on a 
case-by-case basis.
    (4) The State shall use the forms and schedules set forth in the QC 
Manuals and otherwise prescribed by the department to document all 
review findings. The State may substitute their own forms and review 
schedules if approved by the Department in advance.
    (d) Special provisions applicable to error determination. The 
following provisions modify what constitutes a payment error under 
permissible State practice.
    (1) Changes in circumstances. For purposes of this paragraph (d), a 
change in circumstances means a change occurring after the date of 
authorization of the initial payment which may affect the assistance 
unit's eligibility or payment amount. Multiple changes in circumstances 
shall be evaluated individually to assess their impact on the final 
payment error determination. A change in policy or the issuance of a 
hearing decision shall be considered a change in circumstances.
    (i) A change in circumstances shall not be counted as a payment 
error if the change occurred in the review month or the month 
immediately preceding the review month, or if the review month's payment 
continues unadjusted because a hearing was requested.
    (ii) A change in circumstances shall be counted as a payment error 
if the change was incorrectly reflected in the review month's payment, 
or if the change occurred in or before the second prior month to the 
review month and was not reflected in the review month's payment.
    (2) Other types of payment error not to be counted. The following 
types of payment error shall not be counted as errors.
    (i) Payment errors which result solely from failure on the part of 
the State to properly implement changes in Federal law or regulation for 
a period of six months after the effective date of the Federal 
legislation or implementing regulations, whichever is later;
    (ii) Payment errors which result solely from a State's reliance on, 
and correct use of, incorrect written factual information provided by 
the Department about matters of fact or from incorrect written 
statements of Federal policy by Department officials. ``Written factual 
information'' means hard copy documentation, such as a signed statement, 
a computer printout or data tape, and reports of specific data provided 
by the Department about a given individual (e.g., social security data). 
``Departmental officials'' means the Assistant Secretary for Children 
and Families (ACF), the ACF Regional Administrator, the ACF Assistant 
Regional Administrator for AFDC programs, or the Director of the Office 
of Family Assistance.
    (iii) Payment errors which result from a declaration by the 
President or the State Governor of a state of emergency or major 
disaster and which directly affects the State's ability to make correct 
payments, if adequate documentation of the event and its impact are 
provided. The information shall include: a copy of the declaration; a 
detailed explanation of the circumstances; identification of the 
affected jurisdictions; and the reason(s) why the State's ability to 
make correct payments has been or will be impaired;
    (iv) Payment errors which result solely from failure of the 
assistance unit to submit a monthly report;
    (v) Payment errors which result when a recipient--
    (A) Does not have a social security number, but has filed an 
application (as defined by the Social Security Administration) for a 
number within 30 calendar days after the date of application for 
assistance, or
    (B) Does not furnish a social security number upon receipt but has 
furnished a social security number through the Enumeration at Birth 
(EAB) project by the next redetermination of eligibility or within six 
months after the receipt of the social security number, whichever occurs 
earlier; and
    (vi) Payment errors which are inconsistent with fair hearing 
decisions

[[Page 36]]

under Sec. 205.10 of this part when the hearing decision meets the 
following criteria:
    (A) The decision is based only on the case circumstances that 
existed as of the QC review month;
    (B) The State defended the adverse action during the hearing 
process; and
    (C) The request for adjustment is made within eleven months after 
the end of the annual sample period to which the adjustment would apply, 
or the date of the last appeal decision by the Quality Control Review 
Panel, whichever occurs later.
    (e) Sample disposition and data submission time frames. (1) The 
State shall input review findings for disposed of active sample cases 
into the computer terminal provided by the Federal government and 
transmit the edited data to a designated host computer. For States that 
cannot transmit the data due to lack of equipment or a telecommunication 
linkage, the State shall submit the review findings in a format 
specified by the Department. The State shall submit the review findings 
for disposed of negative sample cases also in a format specified by the 
Department.
    (i) Review findings of both active and negative case samples shall 
be disposed of and submitted in accordance with the following time 
frames:
    (A) Seventy-five percent or all but 5 cases of the cases selected in 
both the active and negative case samples each month, within 75 calendar 
days after the end of each sample month;
    (B) Ninety-five percent or all but five cases of the cases selected 
in both the active and negative case samples each month, within 95 
calendar days after the end of each sample month; and
    (C) One hundred percent of the cases selected in both the active and 
negative case samples each month, within 120 calendar days after the end 
of each sample month;
    (ii) If the State does not submit 100 percent of the review findings 
of the cases selected in the active case sample each month within 120 
calendar days after the end of the sample month, and the Department 
finds there is insufficient justification for the delay, the Department 
may initiate action to establish the State's error rate under the 
procedures specified in paragraph (h) of this section.
    (2) The State shall submit the review findings for disposed of 
sample cases promptly (i.e., at least on a monthly basis).
    (f) Alternate disposition plan. (1) The State may submit an 
alternate disposition plan for the Department's approval if the State is 
unable to meet the requirements of paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, 
either as a result of circumstances of a permanent or recurring nature, 
or as a result of the occurrence of an unforeseen event during the 
annual sample period. Until the Department approves the alternate 
disposition plan, the State shall continue to comply with the 
requirements in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section. The alternate 
disposition plan may be approved when:
    (i)(A) The State's sample population is dispersed over such great 
distances that conducting the number of field interviews needed to meet 
the requirements of paragraph (e)(1)(i) is cost prohibitive; or
    (B) The State's usual weather conditions or geography make 
significant numbers of the sample population inaccessible or difficult 
to contact during certain times of the year, making it a hardship for 
the State to comply with the requirements of paragraph (e)(1)(i);
    (ii) The State's request contains evidence and data to justify the 
need for an alternate disposition plan, including a description of the 
State's population dispersal or inaccessibility, and the reason(s) why 
the State cannot comply with the requirements in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of 
this section;
    (iii) The request contains detail on the State's proposed 
disposition schedule for sample cases, including the annual sample 
period(s) to be covered, the revised disposition dates and percentages, 
and the revised schedule for the transmission of the edited review 
findings of the sample cases; and
    (iv) The request is submitted at least 60 calendar days before the 
beginning of the first annual sample period covered by the alternate 
disposition plan.
    (2) The Department may approve a temporary alternate disposition 
plan for a particular annual sample period based on unforeseen events 
and allow

[[Page 37]]

the State to submit the edited review findings of its sample cases at 
later dates than those specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, 
when:
    (i) Unforeseen events (e.g., floods, earthquakes, computer 
breakdowns, snow-storms and labor disputes) occur which prevent the 
State temporarily from meeting the requirements in paragraph (e) of this 
section; and
    (ii) The request contains a description of the circumstances of the 
unforeseen event, the period to be covered by the alternate disposition 
plan, the revised disposition dates and percentages, and the revised 
schedule for the transmission of the edited review findings of the 
sample cases.
    (g) Federal re-review of State sample cases. As part of the Federal 
monitoring of State QC programs, the Department conducts a re-review of 
a subsample of each State's AFDC active case sample.
    (1) The State shall provide the original or legible copies of the 
case record and State QC file for each subsample case, by mail or 
delivery service, within 10 calendar days after the State's receipt of a 
request for such information.
    (2) The information provided shall include records relating to 
public assistance, recipients and third parties, including information 
available under Sec. 205.55 of this part.
    (3) The Department may grant exceptions to these requirements in 
unusual circumstances.
    (4) The Department shall conduct reviews of a subsample of the 
State's completed active AFDC sample cases and, as necessary, of the 
State's negative case actions and shall dispose of and report subsample 
findings in accordance with the following time frames:
    (i) Seventy-five percent of the subsampled cases selected each month 
within 75 calendar days after the end of the month in which they are 
selected;
    (ii) Ninety-five percent of the subsampled cases selected each month 
within 95 calendar days after the end of the month in which they are 
selected; and
    (iii) One hundred percent of the subsampled cases selected each 
month within 120 calendar days after the end of the month in which they 
are selected.
    (h) Effects of failure to complete the sample. This paragraph 
provides the procedures that the Department shall follow if a State 
fails to complete a valid and reliable AFDC active case sample in 
accordance with prescribed QC procedures and deadlines which include 
obtaining and using information available under Sec. 205.55 of this 
part.
    (1) The Department shall notify the State of its failure to complete 
its sample and provide the State the opportunity to negotiate a solution 
for the completion of the sample.
    (2) When a State is unable to negotiate a solution or fails to carry 
out a negotiated solution, the Department shall, directly or through 
contractual or other such arrangement as appropriate, conduct the review 
and establish the fiscal year error rate for the State on the basis of 
the best data reasonably available to the Department, in accordance with 
statistical methods that would apply if the reviews were completed by 
the State.
    (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, total 
payments to a State under section 403(a)(3)(D) of the Act for the proper 
and efficient administration of the State plan shall be reduced by the 
costs incurred by the Federal government to complete the State's sample.
    (i) Difference resolution process. A ``difference'' is a 
disagreement between State and Federal review findings that affect the 
State's official AFDC payment error rate (i.e., a difference between a 
State review and a Federal re-review finding of a correct payment, 
overpayment, underpayment, or a payment to an ineligible case, or a 
Federal finding that the sample case should be dropped from the QC 
review). The process for resolving the difference shall be as follows:
    (1) The State shall be notified in writing of the disagreement and 
afforded an opportunity to request a review of the difference by the ACF 
Regional Administrator.
    (2) The State shall respond to the difference notification within 30 
calendar days after receipt of such notification

[[Page 38]]

agreeing, or indicating reasons for disagreeing, with the Federal 
finding. Responses postmarked, otherwise officially dated, or delivered 
by the 30th calendar day after the date of the receipt of the difference 
letter shall have met the deadline. If the deadline is a Saturday, 
Sunday, legal holiday, or an office closing, the deadline shall be 
extended to the next business day. If the State fails to respond within 
the 30-day deadline, the Federal finding shall be the final decision of 
the Department.
    (3) The Regional Administrator shall respond to the State within 21 
calendar days of receipt of the review request. The response shall 
either be a decision on the State's request, or an indication that the 
decision will be delayed pending further review of applicable laws, 
regulations, or policies.
    (4) If the State disagrees with the Regional Administrator's 
decision, it may seek review with the Quality Control Review Panel. The 
appeal request shall be postmarked, otherwise officially dated, or 
delivered to the Panel by the 30th calendar day after the receipt of the 
Regional Administrator's decision; otherwise the Regional 
Administrator's decision shall be the final decision of the Department. 
If the deadline is a Saturday, Sunday, legal holiday, or an office 
closing, the deadline shall be extended to the next business day. The 
State shall forward an informational copy of its appeal request to the 
Department's regional office concurrent with submittal of its request to 
the Review Panel. The State may submit to the Panel any documentation 
appropriate to substantiate its position as part of its appeal request. 
Extensions may be granted by the Panel for a State to submit 
documentation in support of its appeal where good cause is shown.
    (5) The Panel shall evaluate all of the pertinent evidence submitted 
and shall notify the State of its decision (within a target date of 45 
calendar days following the completion of the record as determined by 
the Panel). Unless the Secretary chooses to review an individual 
difference case, the decision of the Panel with respect to that case 
shall constitute the decision of the Secretary for establishing a 
State's payment error rate for the fiscal year.

Sec. 205.43  Determination of payment error rates and disallowances of Federal financial participation for erroneous payments.

    (a) Purpose. This section sets forth the rules and procedures for 
calculating State AFDC error rates and for disallowing Federal financial 
participation (FFP) to the States with erroneous payments in excess of 
the national standard for a fiscal year.
    (b) Definitions. In addition to the definitions in Secs. 205.40(b) 
and 205.41(b) of this part, the following definitions apply to this 
section.
    (1) Child support collection rate means the ratio of--
    (i) The sum of the number of AFDC cases reported by the State IV-D 
agency for each quarter in the fiscal year for which an assignment under 
section 402(a)(26) of the Act and a collection were made, to
    (ii) The sum of the number of AFDC cases with such assignments 
reported by the State IV-D agency for each quarter in the fiscal year.
    (2) National child support collection rate for a fiscal year means 
the ratio of the sum of the number of cases (excluding AFDC ``arrears-
only'' cases ) described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section reported 
by all States for quarters in the fiscal year, to the sum of the number 
of cases described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section reported by 
all States for quarters in the fiscal year.
    (3) National overpayment rate means the ratio of the total amount of 
erroneous assistance payments made by all States to the total amount of 
assistance paid by all States for the fiscal year. (This figure is 
equivalent to the ratio of the average monthly erroneous assistance 
payment per case for all States to the average monthly assistance 
payment per case for all States.) The rate shall be computed as the sum, 
over all States, of the product of each State's regressed overpayment 
rate and total amount of assistance payments divided by the sum of the 
total amount of assistance payments of all States for

[[Page 39]]

the fiscal year. The rate shall not be changed after disallowance 
notification to all States.
    (4) National negative case action error rate means the ratio of the 
total number of incorrect negative case actions taken.
    (5) National standard means the national overpayment rate for the 
fiscal year or four percent, whichever is larger.
    (6) National underpayment rate means the ratio of the total amount 
of assistance that should have been but was erroneously not paid for the 
fiscal year, to the total amount of assistance paid by all States. (This 
figure is equivalent to the ratio of the average monthly amount of 
assistance payment per case for all states that should have been but 
erroneously was not made, to the average monthly assistance payment per 
case for all States.) The rate shall be computed as the sum, over all 
States, of the product of each State's regressed underpayment rate and 
total amount of assistance payments divided by the sum of the total 
amount of assistance payments of all States for the fiscal year. The 
rate shall not be changed after disallowance notification to all States.
    (7) Negative case action error rate means the ratio of the total 
number of incorrect negative case actions taken by a State for the 
fiscal year, to the total number of negative case actions taken.
    (8) Overpayment rate means the ratio of the total amount of 
erroneous assistance payments made by a State for the fiscal year, to 
the total amount of assistance payments made. (This figure is equivalent 
to the ratio of the average monthly erroneous assistance payment per 
case to the average monthly assistance payment per case in a State for 
the fiscal year.) The rate shall be computed as the ratio of the State's 
regressed average monthly erroneous assistance payment per case to the 
State's average monthly assistance payment per case for the fiscal year. 
(For States that use disproportionate stratified sampling, the procedure 
shall be the same as the procedure in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, 
except ``stratum'' shall be substituted for ``State''.)
    (9) Underpayment rate means the ratio of the total amount of 
assistance payments that should have been but erroneously was not made 
by a State for the fiscal year, to the total amount of assistance 
payments made. (This figure is equivalent to the ratio of the average 
monthly assistance payment per case that should have been but 
erroneously was not made by a State to the State's average monthly 
assistance payment per case for the fiscal year.) The rate shall be 
computed as the ratio of the regressed average monthly assistance 
payment per case that should have been but erroneously was not made by a 
State to the State's average monthly assistance payment per case for the 
fiscal year. (For States that use disproportionate stratified sampling, 
the procedure shall be the same as the procedure in paragraph (b)(5) of 
this section, except ``stratum'' shall be substituted for ``State''.)
    (c) General. All error rates for a State shall be based on a double 
sampling methodology which includes a statistically valid State sample 
of cases selected each month during the fiscal year, followed by a 
statistically valid Federal subsample of cases selected from the State 
completed samples. The State error rate shall be the point estimate of 
the regression estimator as set forth in the QC Manual, section 2.
    (d) Error rate notification. The target date for the Department to 
notify each State of its overpayment and underpayment rates and the 
national overpayment and underpayment rates shall be one year after the 
end of the annual sample period or within 30 calendar days of the 
resolution by the Quality Control Review Panel of all differences, 
pursuant to Sec. 205.42(i)(5) of this part, whichever is later.
    (e) Determination of disallowances in Federal matching funds. If a 
State's overpayment rate for a fiscal year exceeds the national 
standard, Federal matching funds to the State shall be reduced. The 
procedure for determining the disallowance for a fiscal year shall be as 
follows:
    (1) State adjusted overpayment rate. A State with an underpayment 
rate below the national underpayment rate in a fiscal year shall have 
its overpayment rate reduced by the amount by

[[Page 40]]

which the national underpayment rate exceeds the State's underpayment 
rate.
    (i) A State shall use the underpayment reduction earned in a fiscal 
year one time only, either in the year in which it was earned, or in one 
of the following two years. Only one underpayment reduction shall be 
applied in any one year. A reduction earned in one year shall not be 
used to reduce an overpayment rate of a prior year.

    Example: The State was disallowance-liable in 1992 and 1993 and had 
earned reductions for low underpayments in 1991, 1992 and 1993. The 
State can apply either the 1991 or 1992 reduction to the 1992 
overpayment rate. If the 1991 reduction is applied to the 1992 error 
rate, the State can then apply either the 1992 or 1993 reduction to the 
1993 error rate. If, in 1992, the State applied the 1992 reduction, then 
either the 1991 or the 1993 reduction can be applied to the 1993 error 
rate. If, in 1993, however, the State applied the 1993 reduction, then 
the 1991 reduction can no longer be used since it was not used in the 
year it was earned or one of the following two years.

    (ii) At the request of a State, the Department shall apply the 
reduction, described in paragraph (e)(1)(i), in determining the State's 
overpayment rate for either of the two following years instead of in 
determining the State's error rate for the fiscal year to which the 
reduction would otherwise apply. The request shall be made in writing 
within 30 calendar days from the date of receipt of the notification 
described in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (2) Basic disallowance amount. If a State's overpayment rate for a 
fiscal year, adjusted as described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, 
exceeds the national standard for the fiscal year, the amount of the 
basic disallowance shall be the product of--
    (i) The Federal share of the State's total AFDC payments for the 
fiscal year;
    (ii) The difference between the State's adjusted overpayment rate 
and the national standard for the fiscal year; and
    (iii) The ratio of the amount obtained in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of 
this section to the national standard, or ``1'', whichever is smaller.
    (3) Reduction of the basic disallowance amount for overpayment 
recoveries. A State's basic disallowance amount for a fiscal year shall 
be reduced to reflect AFDC overpayment recoveries by the State. The 
amount of the reduction shall be the product of--
    (i) The Federal share of payments recovered in the fiscal year; and
    (ii) The ratio of the amount obtained in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of 
this section, to the State's adjusted overpayment rate.
    (4) Reduction for improvement in child support collections. If a 
State's child support collection rate is greater than the national child 
support collection rate for the fiscal year, or is greater than the 
average of the State's child support collection rates for the three 
preceding fiscal years, the State's disallowance amount shall be further 
reduced. The amount of the reduction shall be the product of--
    (i) The amount of the basic disallowance calculated in paragraph 
(e)(2) minus the amount of the reduction calculated in paragraph (e)(3) 
of this section, and
    (ii) The larger of--
    (A) The ratio of the difference between the State and the national 
child support collection rate, to the national child support collection 
rate for the fiscal year; or
    (B) The ratio of the difference between the State's child support 
collection rate for the fiscal year and the State's average child 
support collection rate for the preceding three fiscal years, to the 
State's average child support collection rate for the preceding three 
fiscal years.
    (5) Final disallowance amount. The amount of disallowance imposed on 
the State by the Secretary shall be the amount of the disallowance 
calculated in paragraph (e)(2) of this selection minus the sum of the 
amounts of reductions calculated in paragraphs (e) (3) and (e)(4) of 
this section.

    Example: All references are to paragraph (e) of this section.

1. State adjusted overpayment rate, paragraph--
    (e)(1)--8.0-(3.0-2.8)=7.8%
2. Basic disallowance amount, paragraph--

5. Final disallowance, pragraph--
    (e)(5)=$27,000--($1,155+$8,606)=$17,239

    (f) Disallowance notification and payment schedule. The Department 
shall notify the States with overpayment rates about the national 
standard of their imposed disallowances, with a target date of 60 
calendar days after the release of the error rates for the fiscal year.
    (1) A State subject to a disallowance shall pay the amount of its 
disallowance within 45 calendar days after the date of receipt of the 
notification, or negotiate an agreement with the Department to repay the 
disallowance with interest in calendar quarterly installments over a 
period not to exceed 30 months beginning not later than the first 
calendar quarter after the date of the receipt of the notification.
    (2) If a State fails to pay the amount of the imposed disallowance 
as specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the Department shall 
reduce the Federal matching funds otherwise payable to the State under 
the Social Security Act by amounts sufficient to recover the amount of 
disallowance with interest.
    (3) Interest on the unpaid amount of the State's disallowance shall 
accrue at the overpayment rate pursuant to section 408(i)(3)(A) of the 
Act beginning 45 calendar days after the date the State receives notice 
of the disallowance. If a subsequent appeal by the State is decided in 
the State's favor, the Department shall repay to the State all payments 
made, with interest from the date payment is received at the same 
accrued rate applicable to unpaid disallowances.
    (g) Administrative review of disallowances. A State may appeal the 
imposition of the disallowance to the Departmental Appeals Board in 
writing within 60 calendar days after the receipt of the notification 
described in paragraph (f) of this section. The Board shall consider the 
State's appeal in accordance with 45 CFR part 16.
    (1) The Board shall not review the decisions on difference cases 
made by the Panel or the Secretary but shall incorporate them by 
reference in its disallowance determination.
    (2) If the Board does not decide an appeal within 90 calendar days 
after the date on the State's notice of appeal, interest on the unpaid 
disallowance amount shall be suspended beginning with the 90th calendar 
day and ending on the date of the Board's final decision, except to the 
extent that the Board finds that the State caused or requested the 
delay.
    (h) Judicial review of disallowances. A State may appeal a decision 
by the Department Appeals Board, including a decision incorporated by 
the Board on a difference case, to the Federal district court within 90 
calendar days after the date of the decision by the Board. Court review 
shall be on the record established in the Departmental Appeals Board 
review and shall be in accordance with the standards of review 
prescribed by title 5 U.S.C. 706(2), subparagraphs (A) through (E).

Sec. 205.50  Safeguarding information for the financial assistance programs.

    (a) State plan requirements. A State plan for financial assistance 
under title IV-A of the Social Security Act, must provide that:
    (1) Pursuant to State statute which imposes legal sanctions:
    (i) The use or disclosure of information concerning applicants and 
recipients will be limited to purposes directly connected with:
    (A) The administration of the plan of the State approved under title 
IV-A, the plan or program of the State under title IV-B, IV-D, IV-E, or 
IV-F or under title I, X, XIV, XVI(AABD), XIX, XX, or the Supplemental 
Security Income (SSI) program established by title XVI. Such purposes

Sec. 205.56  Requirements governing the use of income and eligibility information.

    A State plan under title I, IV-A, X, XIV, or XVI (AABD) of the 
Social Security Act must provide that:
    (a) The State agency will use the information obtained under 
Sec. 205.55, in conjunction with other information, for:
    (1) Determining individuals' eligibility for assistance under the 
State plan and determining the amount of assistance. States wishing to 
exclude categories of information items from follow-up must submit for 
the Secretary's approval a follow-up plan describing the categories of 
information items which it proposes to exclude. For each category, the 
State must provide a reasonable justification that follow-up is not 
cost-effective. A formal cost-benefit analysis is not required. A State 
may exclude information items from the following data sources without 
written justification if followed up previously from another source: 
Unemployment compensation information received from the Internal Revenue 
Service, and earnings information received from the Social Security 
Administration. Information items in these categories which are not 
duplicative, but provide new leads, may not be excluded without written 
justification. A State may submit a follow-up plan or alter its plan at 
any time by notifying the Secretary and submitting the necessary 
justification. The Secretary will approve or disapprove categories of 
information items to be excluded under the plan within 60 days of its 
submission. Those categories approved by the Secretary will constitute 
an approved State follow-up plan for IEVS. For those information items 
not excluded from follow-up,
    (i) The State agency shall review and compare the information 
obtained from each data exchange against information contained in the 
case record to

[[Page 48]]

determine whether it affects the applicant's or the recipient's 
eligibility or the amount of assistance.
    (ii) The State agency shall verify that the information is accurate 
and applicable to case circumstances either through the applicant or 
recipient or through a third party, if such verification is determined 
appropriate based on agency experience or is required under paragraph 
(b) of this section.
    (iii) For applicants, if the information is received during the 
application period, the State agency shall use such information, to the 
extent possible, in making the eligibility determination.
    (iv) For individuals who are recipients when the information is 
received or for whom a decision could not be made prior to authorization 
of benefits, the State agency shall within forty-five (45) days of its 
receipt, initiate a notice of case action or an entry in the case record 
that no case action is necessary, except that: Completion of action may 
be delayed beyond forty-five (45) days on no more than twenty (20) 
percent of the information items targeted for follow-up, if:
    (A) The reason that the action cannot be completed within forty-five 
(45) days is the nonreceipt of requested third-party verification; and
    (B) Action is completed promptly, when third party verification is 
received or at the next time eligibility is redetermined, whichever is 
earlier. If action is completed when eligibility is redetermined and 
third party verification has not been received, the State agency shall 
make its decision based on information provided by the recipient and any 
other information in its possession.
    (v) The State agency shall use appropriate procedures to monitor the 
timeliness requirements specified in this subparagraph;
    (2) Investigations to determine whether recipients received 
assistance under the State plan to which they were not entitled; and
    (3) Criminal or civil prosecutions based on receipt of assistance 
under the State plan to which recipients were not entitled.
    (b)(1) State agencies shall not take any adverse action to 
terminate, deny, suspend or reduce benefits to an applicant or 
recipient, based on information produced by a Federal computer matching 
program that is subject to the requirements in the Computer Matching and 
Privacy Protection Act (CMPPA) unless (i) The information has been 
independently verified in accordance with the independent verification 
requirements set out in the State agency's written agreement as required 
by Sec. 205.58 or (ii) The independent verification requirement has been 
waived by the Department's Data Integrity Board.
    (2) The CMPPA defines a matching program as any computerized 
comparison of (i) Two or more automated systems of records or a system 
of records with non-Federal records for the purpose of (A) Establishing 
or verifying the eligibility of, or continuing compliance with statutory 
and regulatory requirements by, applicants for, recipients or 
beneficiaries of, participants in, or providers of services with respect 
to, cash or in-kind assistance or payments under Federal benefit 
programs, or (B) Recouping payments or delinquent debts under such 
Federal benefit programs, or (ii) Two or more automated Federal 
personnel or payroll system of records or a system of Federal personnel 
or payroll record with non-Federal records.
    (c) If the agency intends to reduce, suspend, terminate or deny 
benefits as a result of the actions taken pursuant to this section, the 
agency must provide notice and the opportunity for a fair hearing in 
accordance with Sec. 205.10(a).

    Authority:  Sections 402 and 1102 of the Social Security Act (42 
U.S.C. 602 and 1302) and Pub. L. No. 97-248, 96 Stat. 324, and Pub. L. 
No. 99-603, 100 Stat. 3359.


<R05>
Sec. 206.10  Application, determination of eligibility and furnishing of assistance.

    (a) State plan requirements. A State plan under title I, IV-A, X, 
XIV, or XVI(AABD), of that Social Security Act shall provide that:
    (1) Each individual wishing to do so shall have the opportunity to 
apply for assistance under the plan without delay. Under this 
requirement:
    (i) Each individual may apply under whichever of the State plan 
plans he chooses;
    (ii) The agency shall require a written application, signed under a 
penalty of perjury, on a form prescribed by the State agency, from the 
applicant himself, or his authorized representative, or, where the 
applicant is incompetent or incapacitated, someone acting responsibly 
for him. When an individual is required to be included in an existing 
assistance unit pursuant to paragraph

[[Page 54]]

(a)(1)(vii), such individual will be considered to be included in the 
application, as of the date he is required to be included in the 
assistance unit;
    (iii) An applicant may be assisted, if he so desires, by an 
individual(s) of his choice (who need not be a lawyer) in the various 
aspects of the application process and the redetermination of 
eligibility and may be accompanied by such individual(s) in contacts 
with the agency and when so accompanied may also be represented by them.
    (iv)--(v) [Reserved]
    (vi) Every recipient in a State which provides a supplemental 
payment under Sec. 233.27 of this chapter shall have an opportunity to 
request that payment without delay.
    (vii) For AFDC only, in order for the family to be eligible, an 
application with respect to a dependent child must also include, if 
living in the same household and otherwise eligible for assistance:
    (A) Any natural or adoptive parent, or stepparent (in the case of 
States with laws of general applicability); and
    (B) Any blood-related or adoptive brother or sister; Exception: 
needs and income of disqualified alien siblings, pursuant to 
Sec. 233.50(c), are not considered in determining the eligibility and 
payment of an otherwise eligible dependent child.
    (2)(i) Applicants shall be informed about the eligibility 
requirements and their rights and obligations under the program. Under 
this requirement individuals are given information in written form, and 
orally as appropriate, about coverage, conditions of eligibility, scope 
of the program, and related services available, and the rights and 
responsibilities of applicants for and recipients of assistance. 
Specifically developed bulletins or pamphlets explaining the rules 
regarding eligibility and appeals in simple, understandable terms are 
publicized and available in quantity.
    (ii) Procedures shall be adopted which are designed to assure that 
recipients make timely and accurate reports of any change in 
circumstances which may affect their eligibility or the amount of 
assistance.
    (iii) All applicants for and recipients of assistance shall be 
notified in writing at the time of application and on redetermination 
that eligibility and income information will be regularly requested from 
agencies specified in Sec. 205.55 and will be used to aid in determining 
their eligibility for assistance.
    (3) A decision shall be made promptly on applications, pursuant to 
reasonable State-established time standards not in excess of:
    (i) 45 days for OAA, AFDC, AB, AABD (for aged and blind); and
    (ii) 60 days for APTD, AABD (for disabled). Under this requirement, 
the applicant is informed of the agency's time standard in acting on 
applications which covers the time from date of application under the 
State plan to the date that the assistance check, or notification of 
denial of assistance or change of award is mailed to the applicant or 
recipient. The State's time standards apply except in unusual 
circumstances (e.g., where the agency cannot reach a decision because of 
failure or delay on the part of the applicant or an examining physician, 
or because of some administrative or other emergency that could not be 
controlled by the agency), in which instances the case record shows the 
cause for the delay. The agency's standards of promptness for acting on 
applications or redetermining eligibility shall not be used as a waiting 
period before granting aid, or as a basis for denial of an application 
or for terminating assistance.
    (4) Adequate notice shall be sent to applicants and recipients to 
indicate that assistance has been authorized (including the amount of 
financial assistance) or that it has been denied or terminated. Under 
this requirement, adequate notice means a written notice that contains a 
statement of the action taken, and the reasons for and specific 
regulations supporting such action, and an explanation of the 
individual's right to request a hearing.
    (5)(i) Financial assistance and medical care and services included 
in the plan shall be furnished promptly to eligible individuals without 
any delay attributable to the agency's administrative process, and shall 
be continued regularly to all eligible individuals until they are found 
to be ineligible. Under this requirement there must be

[[Page 55]]

arrangements to assist applicants and recipients in obtaining medical 
care and services in emergency situations on a 24-hour basis, 7 days a 
week.
    (ii) Assistance will not be denied, delayed, or discontinued pending 
receipt of income or other information requested under Sec. 205.55, if 
other evidence establishes the individual's eligibility for assistance.
    (6) Assistance shall begin as specified in the State plan, which:
    (i) For financial assistance.
    (A) Must be no later than:
    (1) The date of authorization of payment, or
    (2) Thirty days in OAA, AFDC, AB, and AABD (as to the aged and 
blind), and 60 days in APTD and AABD (as to the disabled), from the date 
of receipt of a signed and completed application form, whichever is 
earlier: Provided, That the individuals then met all the eligibility 
conditions, and
    (B) For purposes of Federal financial participation in OAA, AB, 
APTD, and AABD, may be as early as the first of the month in which an 
application has been received and the individual meets all the 
eligibility conditions; and
    (C) In AFDC, for purposes of Federal financial participation, may be 
as early as the date of application provided that the assistance unit 
meets all the eligibility conditions; and
    (D) In AFDC, States that pay for the month of application must 
prorate the payment for that month by multiplying the amount payable if 
payment were made for the entire month including special needs in 
accordance with Sec. 233.34 by the ratio of the days in the month 
including and following the date of application (or, at State option, 
the date of authorization of payment) to the total number of days in 
such month. The State plan may provide for using a standard 30-day month 
to determine the prorated amount.
    (7) In cases of proposed action to terminate, discontinue, suspend 
or reduce assistance, the agency shall give timely and adequate notice. 
Such notice shall comply with the provisions of Sec. 205.10 of this 
chapter.
    (8) Each decision regarding eligibility or ineligibility will be 
supported by facts in the applicant's or recipient's case record. Under 
this requirement each application is disposed of by a finding of 
eligibility or ineligibility unless:
    (i) The applicant voluntarily withdraws his application, and there 
is an entry in the case record that a notice has been sent to confirm 
the applicant's notification to the agency that he does not desire to 
pursue his application; or
    (ii) There is an entry in the case record that the application has 
been disposed of because the applicant died or could not be located.
    (9) Where an individual has been determined to be eligible, 
eligibility will be reconsidered or redetermined:
    (i) When required on the basis of information the agency has 
obtained previously about anticipated changes in the individual's 
situation;
    (ii) Promptly, after a report is obtained which indicates changes in 
the individual's circumstances that may affect the amount of assistance 
to which he is entitled or may make him ineligible; and
    (iii) Periodically, within agency established time standards, but 
not less frequently than every 12 months in OAA, AB, APTD, and AABD, on 
eligibility factors subject to change. For recipients of AFDC, all 
factors of eligibility will be redetermined at least every 6 months 
except in the case of monthly reporting cases or cases covered by an 
approved error-prone profiling system as specified in paragraph 
(a)(9)(iv) of this section. Under the AFDC program, at least one face-
to-face redetermination must be conducted in each case once in every 12 
months.
    (iv) In accordance with paragraph (a)(9)(iii) of this section, under 
an alternative redetermination plan based on error-prone profiling, 
which has been approved by the Secretary, and includes:
    (A) A description of the statistical methodology used to develop the 
error-prone profile system upon which the redetermination schedule is 
based;
    (B) The criteria to be used to vary the scope of review and to 
assign different types of cases; and
    (C) A detailed outline of the evaluation system, including 
provisions for necessary changes in the error-prone

[[Page 56]]

output, such as types of cases, types of errors, frequencies of 
redeterminations and corrective action.
    (10) Standards and methods for determination of eligibility shall be 
consistent with the objectives of the programs, and will respect the 
rights of individuals under the United States Constitution, the Social 
Security Act, title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and all other 
relevant provisions of Federal and State laws.
    (11) [Reserved]
    (12) The State agency shall establish and maintain methods by which 
it shall be kept currently informed about local agencies' adherence to 
the State plan provisions and to the State agency's procedural 
requirements for determining eligibility, and it shall take corrective 
action when necessary.
    (b) Definitions. For purposes of this section:
    (1) Applicant is a person who has, directly, or through his 
authorized representative, or where incompetent or incapacitated, 
through someone acting responsibly for him, made application for public 
assistance from the agency administering the program, and whose 
application has not been terminated.
    (2) Application is the action by which an individual indicates in 
writing to the agency administering public assistance (on a form 
prescribed by the State agency) his desire to receive assistance. The 
relative with whom a child is living or will live ordinarily makes 
application for the child for AFDC. An application is distinguished from 
an inquiry, which is simply a request for information about eligibility 
requirements for public assistance. Such inquiry may be followed by an 
application. When an individual is required to be included in an 
existing assistance unit pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(vii), such 
individual will be considered to be included in the application, as of 
the date he is required to be included in the assistance unit.
    (3) Date of Application is the date on which the action described in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section occurs.
    (4) Redetermination is a review of factors affecting AFDC 
eligibility and payment amount; e.g. continued absence, income 
(including child and spousal support), etc.
    (5) Assistance Unit is the group of individuals whose income, 
resources and needs are considered as a unit for purposes of determining 
eligibility and the amount of payment.

all available medical and other pertinent information concerning the 
individual.
    (c) Appropriate authority or person. For the purpose of paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section a medical officer of the Public Health Service or 
of another agency of the United States, or a medical practitioner 
legally authorized to provide care or treatment of mentally ill persons 
in the foreign country, is an ``appropriate authority or person,'' and 
shall be so identified in his execution of the certificate. If such a 
medical officer or practitioner is unavailable, an authorized official 
of the Department of State may serve as an ``appropriate authority or 
person,'' and shall, in the execution of the certificate, identify 
himself as serving as such person due to the unavailability of a 
suitable medical officer or practitioner.


<R05>
Sec. 211.4  Notification to legal guardian, spouse, next of kin, or interested persons.

    (a) Whenever an eligible person arrives in the United States from a 
foreign country, or when such person is

[[Page 58]]

transferred from one State to another, the Administrator shall, upon 
such arrival or transfer (or in advance thereof, if possible), provide 
for notification of his legal guardian, or in the absence of such a 
guardian, of his spouse or next of kin, or in the absence of any of 
these, of one or more interested persons, if known.
    (b) Whenever an eligible person is admitted to a hospital pursuant 
to the Act, the Administrator shall provide for immediate notification 
of his legal guardian, spouse, or next of kin, if known.


<R05>
Sec. 211.5  Action under State law; appointment of guardian.

    Whenever an eligible person is incapable of giving his consent to 
care and treatment in a hospital, either because of his mental condition 
or because he is a minor, the agency will take appropriate action under 
State law, including, if necessary, procuring the appointment of a legal 
guardian, to ensure the proper planning for and provision of such care 
and treatment.


<R05>
Sec. 211.6  Reception; temporary care, treatment, and assistance.

    (a) Reception. The agency will meet the eligible person at the port 
of entry or debarkation, will arrange for appropriate medical 
examination, and will plan with him, in cooperation with his legal 
guardian, or, in the absence of such a guardian, with other interested 
persons, if any, for needed temporary care and treatment.
    (b) Temporary care, treatment, and assistance. The agency will 
provide for temporary care, treatment, and assistance, as reasonably 
required for the health and welfare of the eligible person. Such care, 
treatment, and assistance may be provided in the form of hospitalization 
and other medical and remedial care (including services of necessary 
attendants), food and lodging, money, payments, transportation, or other 
goods and services. The agency will utilize the Public Health Service 
General Hospital nearest to the port of entry or debarkation or any 
other suitable public or private hospital, in providing hospitalization 
and medical care, including diagnostic service as needed, pending other 
appropriate arrangements for serving the eligible person.


<R05>
Sec. 211.7  Transfer and release of eligible person.

    (a) Transfer and release to relative. If at the time of arrival from 
a foreign country or any time during temporary or continuing care and 
treatment the Administrator finds that the best interests of the 
eligible person will be served thereby, and a relative, having been 
fully informed of his condition, agrees in writing to assume 
responsibility for his care and treatment, the Administrator shall 
transfer and release him to such relative. In determining whether his 
best interest will be served by such transfer and release, due weight 
shall be given to the relationship of the individuals involved, the 
financial ability of the relative to provide for such person, and the 
accessibility to necessary medical facilities.
    (b) Transfer and release to appropriate State authorities, or agency 
of the United States. If appropriate arrangements cannot be accomplished 
under paragraph (a) of this section, and if no other agency of the 
United States is responsible for the care and treatment of the eligible 
person, the Administrator shall endeavor to arrange with the appropriate 
State mental health authorities of the eligible person's State of 
residence or legal domicile, if any, for the assumption of 
responsibility for the care and treatment of the eligible person by such 
authorities and shall, upon the making of such arrangements in writing, 
transfer and release him to such authorities. If any other agency of the 
United States is responsible for the care and treatment of the eligible 
person, the Administrator shall make arrangements for his transfer and 
release to that agency.


<R05>
Sec. 211.8  Continuing hospitalization.

    (a) Authorization and arrangements. In the event that appropriate 
arrangements for an eligible person in need of continuing care and 
treatment in a hospital cannot be accomplished under Sec. 211.7, or 
until such arrangements can be made, care and treatment shall be 
provided by the Administrator in Saint Elizabeths Hospital in the 
District of Columbia, in an appropriate Public

[[Page 59]]

Health Service Hospital, or in such other suitable public or private 
hospital as the Administrator determines is in the best interests of 
such person.
    (b) Transfer to other hospital. At any time during continuing 
hospitalization, when the Administrator deems it to be in the interest 
of the eligible person or of the hospital affected, the Administrator 
shall authorize the transfer of such person from one hospital to another 
and, where necessary to that end, the Administrator shall authorize the 
initiation of judicial proceedings for the purpose of obtaining a 
commitment of such person to the Secretary.
    (c) Place of hospitalization. In determining the placement or 
transfer of an eligible person for purposes of hospitalization, due 
weight shall be given to such factors as the location of the eligible 
person's legal guardian or family, the character of his illness and the 
probable duration thereof, and the facilities of the hospital to provide 
care and treatment for the particular health needs of such person.


<R05>
Sec. 211.9  Examination and reexamination.

    Following admission of an eligible person to a hospital for 
temporary or continuing care and treatment, he shall be examined by 
qualified members of the medical staff as soon as practicable, but not 
later than the fifth day after his admission. Each such person shall be 
reexamined at least once within each six month period beginning with the 
month following the month in which he was first examined.


<R05>
Sec. 211.10  Termination of hospitalization.

    (a) Discharge or conditional release. If, following an examination, 
the head of the hospital finds that the eligible person hospitalized for 
mental illness (whether or not pursuant to a judicial commitment) is not 
in need of such hospitalization, he shall be discharged. In the case 
where hospitalization was pursuant to a judicial commitment, the head of 
the hospital may, in accordance with laws governing hospitalization for 
mental illness as may be in force and generally applicable in the State 
in which the hospital is located, conditionally release him if he finds 
that this is in his best interests.
    (b) Notification to committing court. In the case of any person 
hospitalized under Sec. 211.8 who has been judicially committed to the 
custody of the Secretary, the Secretary will notify the committing court 
in writing of the discharge or conditional release of such person under 
this section or of his transfer and release under Sec. 211.7.


<R05>
Sec. 211.11  Request for release from hospitalization.

    If an eligible person who is hospitalized pursuant to the Act, or 
his legal guardian, spouse, or adult next of kin, requests his release, 
such request shall be granted by the Administrator if his best interests 
will be served thereby, or by the head of the hospital if he is found 
not to be in need of hospitalization by reason of mental illness. The 
right of the administrator or the head of the hospital, to refuse such 
request and to detain him for care and treatment shall be determined in 
accordance with laws governing the detention, for care and treatment, of 
persons alleged to be mentally ill as may be in force and applicable 
generally in the State in which such hospital is located, but in no 
event shall the patient be detained more than forty-eight hours 
(excluding any period of time falling on a Sunday or a legal holiday 
observed by the courts of the State in which such hospital is located) 
after the receipt of such request unless within such time (a) judicial 
proceedings for such hospitalization are commenced or (b) a judicial 
extension of such time is obtained, for a period of not more than five 
days, for the commencement of such proceedings.


<R05>
Sec. 211.12  Federal payments.

    The arrangements made by the Administrator with an agency or 
hospital for carrying out the purposes of the Act shall provide for 
payments to such agency or hospital, either in advance or by way of 
reimbursement, of the costs of reception, temporary care, treatment, and 
assistance, continuing

[[Page 60]]

care and treatment, and transportation, pursuant to the Act, and 
payments for other expenditures necessarily and reasonably related to 
providing the same. Such arrangements shall include the methods and 
procedures for determining the amounts of the advances or 
reimbursements, and for remittance and adjustment thereof.


<R05>
Sec. 211.13  Financial responsibility of the eligible person; collections, compromise, or waiver of payment.

    (a) For temporary care and treatment. If an eligible person 
receiving temporary care, treatment, and assistance, pursuant to the 
Act, has financial resources available to pay all or part of the costs 
of such care, the Administrator shall require him to pay for such costs, 
either in advance or by way of reimbursement, unless in his judgment it 
would be inequitable or impracticable to require such payment.
    (b) For continuing care and treatment. Any eligible person receiving 
continuing care and treatment in a hospital, or his estate, shall be 
liable to pay or contribute toward the payment of the costs or charges 
therefor, to the same extent as such person would, if a resident of the 
District of Columbia, be liable to pay, under the laws of the District 
of Columbia, for his care and maintenance in a hospital for the mentally 
ill in that jurisdiction.
    (c) Collections, compromise, or waiver of payment. The Administrator 
may, in his discretion, where in his judgment substantial justice will 
be best served thereby or the probable recovery will not warrant the 
expense of collection, compromise, or waive the whole or any portion of, 
any claim for continuing care and treatment, and assistance, and in the 
process of arriving at such decision, the Administrator may make or 
cause to be made such investigations as may be necessary to determine 
the ability of the patient to pay or contribute toward the cost of his 
continuing care and treatment in a hospital.


<R05>
Sec. 211.14  Disclosure of information.

    (a) No disclosure of any information of a personal and private 
nature with respect to an individual obtained at any time by any person, 
organization, or institution in the course of discharging the duties of 
the Secretary under the Act shall be made except insofar:
    (1) As the individual or his legal guardian, if any (or, if he is a 
minor, his parent or legal guardian), shall consent;
    (2) As disclosure may be necessary to carry out any functions of the 
Secretary under the Act;
    (3) As disclosure may be directed by the order of a court of 
competent jurisdiction;
    (4) As disclosure may be necessary to carry out any functions of any 
agency of the United States which are related to the return of the 
individual from a foreign country, or his entry into the United States; 
or
    (5) As expressly authorized by the Administrator.
    (b) An agreement made with an agency or hospital for care, 
treatment, and assistance pursuant to the Act shall provide that no 
disclosure will be made of any information of a personal and private 
nature received by such agency or hospital in the course of discharging 
the duties under such agreement except as is provided therein, or is 
otherwise specifically authorized by the Administrator.
    (c) Nothing in this section shall preclude disclosure, upon proper 
inquiry, of information as to the presence of an eligible person in a 
hospital, or as to his general condition and progress.


<R05>
Sec. 211.15  Nondiscrimination.

    (a) No eligible person shall, on the ground of race, color, or 
national origin, be excluded from participation, be denied any benefits, 
or otherwise be subjected to discrimination of any nature or form in the 
provision of any benefits, under the Act.
    (b) The prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section precludes 
discrimination either in the selection of individuals to receive the 
benefits, in the scope of benefits, or in the manner of providing them. 
It extends to all facilities and services provided by the Administrator 
or an agency to an individual, and to the arrangements and the 
procedures under this part relating thereto, in connection with 
reception, temporary care, treatment, and assistance, and continuing 
hospitalization under the Act.

cost of other expenditures necessarily and reasonably related to 
providing the same. Such agreement shall include the cost of other 
expenditures necessarily and reasonably related to providing the same. 
Such agreement shall include the method for determining such costs, as 
well as the methods and procedures for determining the amounts of 
advances or reimbursement and for remittance and adjustment thereof.
    (b) To receive reimbursements, States, or other agencies, shall

by high school graduates, or by persons with little or no formal 
education.

for expenses incurred in the giving of services. Such payment does not 
reflect the value of the services rendered, or the amount of time given

cooperate as required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the 
State or local agency will:
    (1) Deny assistance to the caretaker relative without regard to 
other eligibility factors; and
    (2) Provide assistance to the eligible child in the form of 
protective payments as described in Sec. 234.60 of this chapter. Such 
assistance will be determined without regard to the needs of the 
caretaker relative.

Sec. 232.13  Cooperation in identifying and providing information to assist the State in pursuing third party liability for medical services.

    (a) The State plan must provide that as a condition of eligibility, 
each applicant for or recipient of AFDC will be required to cooperate 
(unless good cause for refusing to do so is determined to exist in 
accordance with Secs. 232.40 through 232.49) with the State in:
    (1) Identifying any third party who may be liable for care and 
services available under the State's title XIX State plan in behalf of 
the applicant or recipient or in behalf of any other family member 
(including parents and siblings as required under Sec. 206.10(a)(1)(vii) 
(A) and (B)) for whom the applicant or recipient is applying for or 
receiving assistance; and
    (2) Providing relevant information, consistent with rules issued by 
the Health Care Financing Administration at 42 CFR 433.138(b), to assist 
the State in pursuing any such potentially liable third party resources. 
Such information may include, but is not limited to, the name of the 
health insurance policy holder, his or her relationship to the applicant 
or recipient, the social security number of the policy holder, and the 
name and address of the insurance company and policy number.
    (b) The plan shall provide that if the applicant or recipient fails 
to cooperate as required by this section (unless good cause is 
determined to exist), the State or local agency shall:
    (1) Deny assistance to the applicant or recipient without regard to 
other eligibility factors; and
    (2) Provide assistance to the eligible child in the form of 
protective payments as described in Sec. 234.60 of this chapter. Such 
assistance will be determined without regard to the needs of the 
applicant or recipient.
    (c) Federal financial participation (FFP) is available for title IV-
A administrative costs associated with identifying and providing 
information about a potentially liable third party as part of the 
eligibility determination for the AFDC program. FFP is also available 
for IV-A administrative costs associated with determining good cause for 
failure to cooperate, and providing assistance in the form of protective 
payments.

Sec. 232.20  Treatment of child support collections made in the Child Support Enforcement Program as income and resources in the Title IV-A Program.

    (a) Definition. For purposes of this section, notwithstanding any 
other regulations in this chapter, support collections, monthly 
collections and support amounts for a month mean the assigned amount 
that the support enforcement agency collects from an absent parent or 
spouse on a monthly support obligation, less the disregarded sum under 
Sec. 302.51(b)(1).
    (b) The State plan must provide that in any case in which support 
payments are collected for a recipient of AFDC with respect to whom an 
assignment under Sec. 232.11 is effective:
    (1) Upon notification by the IV-D agency of the amount of a support 
collection, the IV-A agency will use such amount to review eligibility 
of the assistance unit under Sec. 206.10(a)(9)(ii). This use of these 
amounts so collected shall not be later than the second month after the 
month in which the IV-A agency received a report of the monthly 
collections from the IV-D agency. In determining whether a support 
collection made by the State's IV-D agency, which represents support 
amounts for a month as determined pursuant to Sec. 302.51(a) of this 
title, is sufficient to make the family ineligible for an assistance 
payment for the month to which the redetermination applies, the State 
will determine if such collection, when treated as if it were income, 
makes the family ineligible for an assistance payment. If such treatment 
makes the family ineligible, the IV-A agency will notify the family and 
the IV-D agency of the effective date of the family's ineligibility. The 
IV-D agency will treat the support collection that caused ineligibility 
in accordance with Sec. 302.32. If such treatment does not make the 
family ineligible for an assistance payment, the assistance payment will 
be calculated without regard to such collection except that, when 
required under Sec. 232.21 supplemental payments must be calculated and 
issued.
    (2) Any payment received pursuant to Sec. 302.51(b) (3) or (5) shall 
be treated as income in the month following the month to which the 
redetermination in paragraph (b)(1) of this section applies.
    (c) From any amounts of assistance payments which are reimbursed by 
support collections made by the IV-D agency, the IV-A agency shall pay 
the Federal government its share of the collections made, after the 
incentive payments, if any, have been made pursuant to Sec. 302.52 of 
chapter III of this title.
    (d) The State plan must provide that the IV-A agency, on behalf of 
the IV-D agency, will send to the family the sum disregarded under 
Sec. 302.51(b)(1) within 15 calendar days of the end of the month in 
which the support was initially received in the State.

Sec. 232.21  Computation of a supplemental payment when there is a support payment.

    (a) The purpose of this section is to provide for the computation of 
a supplemental payment under section 402(a)(28) of the Social Security 
Act. When used in this section--
    Countable income means the amount of the recipient's gross income 
that is used in the computation of the assistance payment after 
application of all disregards, including work-related expenses.
    Countable support payment means the support collected on the current 
month's support obligation less an amount not in excess of the first $50 
collected on that obligation. It also means the excess payments paid to 
the recipient by the IV-D agency under 45 CFR 302.51(b) (3) and (5).
    Disposable income means the sum of the assistance payment, and the 
countable income used in determining the amount of the payment.
    Arrearages means all collections of past due support exclusive of 
those made through the Federal and State income tax refund offset.

[[Page 74]]

    (b) The State plan must provide that, if the redetermination under 
Sec. 232.20 indicates that the support payment made on the current 
month's support obligation would not cause ineligibility, and the State 
permitted recipients during July 1975 to retain countable income without 
an equal reduction in their assistance payment, and it currently has 
such a policy in effect, a supplemental payment will be computed for the 
current month.
    (1) The supplemental payment for a month shall equal the maximum 
portion of the total support collected in that month which would not 
reduce the assistance payment if paid directly to the family. In 
determining this amount, the State agency will--
    (i) First consider income from sources other than the support 
collection; and
    (ii) Include in the amount of support collected the maximum amount 
of any arrearages paid which would not cause ineligibility if paid 
directly to the family.
    (2) The supplemental payment will be computed as follows:
    (i) The State IV-A agency determines the assistance payment which 
would result from treating as income to the family the largest amount of 
the month's child support collection, including arrearages, that will 
not cause ineligibility. Using that assistance payment, and using that 
amount of the support collection as countable income, disposable income 
is computed.
    (ii) The State agency then determines the amount of the assistance 
payment for which the family would be eligible if there were no support 
collection. Using that assistance payment, disposable income is again 
computed.
    (iii) The supplemental payment is the amount of disposable income as 
computed in step (i) less the amount of disposable income as computed in 
step (ii).
    (iv) Examples:

    Example 1.  The State computes the assistance payment by subtracting 
income from the need standard and pays the deficit or a maximum by 
family size, whichever is less: (All figures are assumed and do not 
include income from any other source.)
    Step (i): Treating countable support payment as income. Subtract a 
countable support payment of $100 from a need standard of $300. The 
deficit is $200. Assume the State's maximum for this family size is 
$150; therefore, the assistance payment would be $150. The assistance 
unit would have a $150 assistance payment and the $100 countable support 
payment for a total disposable income of $250.
    Step (ii): Not treating countable support payment as income. There 
is no income to subtract from the need standard. Thus the assistance 
payment would be the maximum of $150 for this family size, which would 
also be the disposable income.
    Step (iii): Taking the difference. The supplemental payment is the 
difference between the disposable income computed under steps (i) and 
(ii), $250 minus $150, or $100.
    Example 2. The State computes the assistance payment by subtracting 
income from a reduced need standard and pays the deficit or a maximum by 
family size, whichever is less. Assume a need standard of $400, a 
ratable reduction of 70%, and a maximum assistance payment of $200. Also 
assume a $500 total child support collection for the month, $200 of 
which is the current month's support obligation. The State's minimum 
payment is $5.
    Step (i): Treating countable support payments as income. Determine 
the largest part of the $500 child support collection which would not 
cause ineligibility if counted as income to the assistance unit. This 
would be $279 because the State's reduced need standard is $280 (70% of 
$400) and any amount of income over $279 would make the family 
ineligible. The deficit would be $1. The assistance unit would not 
receive an assistance payment, however, they would have the $279 support 
payment as disposable income. No assistance payment is made but the 
family remains eligible under Sec. 233.20(a)(3)(viii) (C) and (D).
    Step (ii): Not treating countable support payment as income. There 
is no income to subtract from the reduced need standard, thus the 
assistance payment would be the maximum of $200 for this family size, 
which would also be the disposable income.
    Step (iii): Taking the difference. The supplemental payment is the 
difference between the disposal incomes computed under steps (i) and 
(ii), $280 minus $200, or $80.

    (c) A supplemental payment under this section may either be added to 
the assistance payment for which the unit is otherwise eligible, to make 
a new total assistance payment for the month or be issued separately. In 
the examples in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section, the new total 
assistance payments would be $250 ($150 plus $100) in Example 1, and 
$280 ($200 plus $80) in Example 2.

Sec. 232.40  Claiming good cause for refusing to cooperate.

    (a) Opportunity to claim good cause. The plan shall provide that an 
applicant for, or recipient of, AFDC will have the opportunity to claim 
good cause for refusing to cooperate as required by Sec. 232.12 or 
Sec. 232.13.
    (b) Notice to applicant or recipient. (1) The plan shall provide 
that: (i) Prior to requiring cooperation under Sec. 232.12 or 
Sec. 232.13, the State or local agency will notify the applicant or 
recipient of the right to claim good cause as an exception to the 
cooperation requirement and of all the requirements applicable to a good 
cause determination;
    (ii) The notice will be in writing, with a copy furnished to the 
applicant or recipient; and
    (iii) The applicant or recipient and the caseworker will acknowledge 
that the applicant or recipient received the notice by signing and 
dating a copy of the notice, which will be placed in the case record.
    (2) The notice may be in two parts. If the State elects a two part 
notice:
    (i) The first notice shall: (A) Advise the applicant or recipient of 
the potential benefits the child may derive from the establishment of 
paternity, securing support, and identifying and providing information 
to assist the State in pursuing third party liability for medical 
services;
    (B) Advise the applicant or recipient that by law, cooperation in 
establishing paternity, securing support, and pursuing liability for 
medical services is a condition of eligibility for AFDC;
    (C) Advise the applicant or recipient of the sanctions provided by 
Secs. 232.12 and 232.13 for refusal to cooperate without good cause;
    (D) Advise the applicant or recipient that good cause for refusal to 
cooperate may be claimed; and that if the State or local agency 
determines, in accordance with this section, that there is good cause, 
the applicant or recipient will be excused from the cooperation 
requirement; and
    (E) Advise the applicant or recipient that upon request, or 
following a claim of good cause, the agency will provide further notice 
with additional details concerning good cause.
    (ii) The second notice, which will be provided promptly upon request 
of the applicant or recipient or following a claim of good cause, shall:
    (A) Indicate that the applicant or recipient must provide 
corroborative evidence of a good cause circumstance (as specified in 
Sec. 232.43 (b) and (f)) and must, when requested, furnish sufficient 
information to permit the State or local agency to investigate the 
circumstances;
    (B) Inform the applicant or recipient that upon request, the State 
or local agency will provide reasonable assistance in obtaining the 
corroborative evidence;
    (C) Inform the applicant or recipient that on the basis of the 
corroborative evidence supplied and the agency's investigation, if 
necessary, the State or local agency will determine whether cooperation 
would be against the best interests of the child for whom support or 
third party liability for medical services would be sought;
    (D) List the circumstances (as specified in Sec. 232.42) under which 
cooperation may be determined to be against the best interests of the 
child;
    (E) Inform the applicant or recipient that the State title IV-D 
agency and the State title XIX agency may review the State or local 
agency's findings and basis for a good cause determination and may 
participate in any hearings concerning the issue of good cause; and
    (F) As applicable (see Sec. 232.49), inform the applicant or 
recipient that either: The State title IV-D agency will not attempt to 
establish paternity and collect support and the State title XIX agency 
may not attempt to collect third party information or pursue third

[[Page 76]]

parties liable for medical services in those cases where the applicant 
or recipient is determined to have good cause for refusing to cooperate; 
or the State title IV-D agency may attempt to establish paternity and 
collect support and the State title XIX agency may pursue liable third 
parties in those cases where the State or local agency determines that 
this can be done without risk to the applicant or recipient if done 
without their participation.
    (3) The State or local agency may, at its option, provide a single 
combined notice that contains all of the elements in paragraphs (b)(2) 
(i) and (ii) of this section.
    (4) Appendix A to this part 232 is a suggested two part notice 
format that meets the requirements of this section.
    (c) Requirements upon applicant or recipient. (1) The plan shall 
provide that an applicant for, or recipient of, AFDC who refuses to 
cooperate and who claims to have good cause for refusing to cooperate 
has the burden of establishing the existence of a good cause 
circumstance. Such applicant or recipient will be required to:
    (i) Specify the circumstances (see Sec. 232.42) that the applicant 
or recipient believes provide sufficient good cause for not cooperating.
    (ii) Corroborate the good cause circumstances in accordance with 
Sec. 232.43; and
    (iii) If requested, provide sufficient information (such as the 
putative father or absent parent's name and address, if known) to permit 
an investigation pursuant to Sec. 232.43(g).
    (2) The plan shall provide that if the requirements of paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section are not met, the State or local agency shall on 
that basis determine that good cause does not exist.

Sec. 232.41  Determination of good cause for refusal to cooperate.

    The plan shall provide that:
    (a) For each applicant for or recipient of AFDC who claims to have 
good cause, the State or local agency will determine, in accordance with 
Secs. 232.40, 232.42 and 232.43, whether good cause exists.
    (b) The State or local agency's final determination that good cause 
does, or does not exist will:
    (1) Be in writing;
    (2) Contain the agency's findings and basis for determination; and
    (3) Be entered into the AFDC case record.
    (c) The State or local agency's determination of whether or not good 
cause exists will be made within a State established time standard that 
does not exceed 45 days from the day the good cause claim is made. The 
State or local agency may exceed this time standard only where the case 
record documents that the agency needs additional time because the 
information required to verify the claim cannot be obtained within the 
time standard or that the claimant did not provide corroborative 
evidence within the period required by Sec. 232.43(b).
    (d) If the State or local agency determines that good cause does not 
exist:
    (1) The applicant or recipient will be so notified and afforded an 
opportunity to cooperate, withdraw the application for assistance, or 
have the case closed; and
    (2) Continued refusal to cooperate will result in imposition of the 
sanctions provided in Sec. 232.12 or Sec. 232.13.

Sec. 232.42  Good cause circumstances.

    (a) Circumstances under which cooperation may be ``against the best 
interests of the child''. The plan shall provide that the State or local 
agency will determine that cooperation in establishing paternity, 
securing support or identifying and providing information to assist the 
State in pursuing any third party who may be liable to pay for medical 
services available under the State's title XIX plan is against the best 
interests of the child only if:
    (1) The applicant's or recipient's cooperation in establishing 
paternity, securing support, or identifying and providing information to 
assist the State in pursuing third parties potentially liable for 
medical services is reasonably anticipated to result in:
    (i) Physical harm to the child for whom support is to be sought;

[[Page 77]]

    (ii) Emotional harm to the child for whom support is to be sought;
    (iii) Physical harm to the parent or caretaker relative with whom 
the child is living which reduces such person's capacity to care for the 
child adequately;
    (iv) Emotional harm to the parent or caretaker relative with whom 
the child is living, of such nature or degree that it reduces such 
person's capacity to care for the child adequately; or
    (2) At least one of the following circumstances exists, and the 
State or local agency believes that because of the existence of that 
circumstance proceeding to establish paternity, secure support, or to 
identify and provide information to assist States in pursuing third 
party liability for medical services would be detrimental to the child 
for whom support would be sought.
    (i) The child for whom support is sought was conceived as a result 
of incest or forcible rape;
    (ii) Legal proceedings for the adoption of the child are pending 
before a court of competent jurisdiction; or
    (iii) The applicant or recipient is currently being assisted by a 
public or licensed private social agency to resolve the issue of whether 
to keep the child or relinquish him for adoption, and the discussions 
have not gone on for more than 3 months.
    (b) Physical harm and emotional harm defined. Physical harm and 
emotional harm must be of a serious nature in order to justify a finding 
of good cause under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. A finding of good 
cause for emotional harm may only be based upon a demonstration of an 
emotional impairment that substantially affects the individual's 
functioning.
    (c) Special considerations related to emotional harm. The plan shall 
provide that, for every good cause determination which is based in whole 
or part upon the anticipation of emotional harm to the child, the parent 
or the caretaker relative, as provided for in paragraphs (a)(1) (ii) and 
(iv) of this section, the State or local agency will consider the 
following:
    (1) The present emotional state of the individual subject to 
emotional harm;
    (2) The emotional health history of the individual subject to 
emotional harm;
    (3) Intensity and probable duration of the emotional impairment;
    (4) The degree of cooperation to be required; and
    (5) The extent of involvement of the child in the paternity 
establishment, support enforcement activity or collection of information 
to assist the State in the pursuit of third parties to be undertaken.

Sec. 232.43  Proof of good-cause claim.

    The plan shall provide that:
    (a) The State or local agency will make a good-cause determination 
based on the corroborative evidence supplied by the applicant or 
recipient only after it has examined the evidence and found that it 
actually verifies the good-cause claim.
    (b) The applicant or recipient who claims good cause must provide 
corroborative evidence within 20 days from the day the claim was made. 
In exceptional cases where the State or local agency determines the 
applicant or recipient requires additional time because of the 
difficulty of obtaining the corroborative evidence, the agency shall 
allow a reasonable additional period of time upon approval by 
supervisory personnel.
    (c) A good-cause claim may be corroborated with the following types 
of evidence:
    (1) Birth certificates or medical or law enforcement records which 
indicate that the child was conceived as the result of incest or 
forcible rape;
    (2) Court documents or other records which indicate that legal 
proceedings for adoption are pending before a court of competent 
jurisdiction;
    (3) Court, medical, criminal, child protective services, social 
services, psychological, or law enforcement records which indicate that 
the putative father or absent parent might inflict physical or emotional 
harm on the child or caretaker relative;
    (4) Medical records which indicate emotional health history and 
present emotional health status of the caretaker relative or the child 
for whom

[[Page 78]]

support would be sought; or, written statements from a mental health 
professional indicating a diagnosis or prognosis concerning the 
emotional health of the caretaker relative or the child for whom support 
would be sought;
    (5) A written statement from a public or licensed private social 
agency that the applicant or recipient is being assisted by the agency 
to resolve the issue of whether to keep the child or relinquish him for 
adoption; and
    (6) Sworn statements from individuals other than the applicant or 
recipient with knowledge of the circumstances which provide the basis 
for the good-cause claim.
    (d) If after examining the corroborative evidence submitted by the 
applicant or recipient, the State or local agency wishes to request 
additional corroborative evidence which is needed to permit a good-cause 
determination, the agency will:
    (1) Promptly notify the applicant or recipient that additional 
corroborative evidence is needed; and
    (2) Specify the type of document which is needed.
    (e) Upon request, the State or local agency will:
    (1) Advise the applicant or recipient how to obtain the necessary 
documents; and
    (2) Make a reasonable effort to obtain any specific documents which 
the applicant or recipient is not reasonably able to obtain without 
assistance.
    (f) Where a claim is based on the applicant's or recipient's 
anticipation of physical harm as specified and defined in Sec. 232.42 
(a) and (b), and corroborative evidence is not submitted in support of 
the claim:
    (1) The State or local agency will investigate the good-cause claim 
when the agency believes that:
    (i) The claim is credible without corroborative evidence; and
    (ii) Corroborative evidence is not available.
    (2) Good cause will be found if the claimant's statement and the 
investigation which is conducted satisfies the agency that the applicant 
or recipient has good cause for refusing to cooperate.
    (3) A determination that good cause exists will be reviewed and 
approved or disapproved by supervisory personnel and the agency's 
findings will be recorded in the case record.
    (g) The State or local agency may further verify the good-cause 
claim if the applicant's or recipient's statement of the claim required 
by Sec. 232.40(c)(1)(i), together with the corroborative evidence do not 
provide sufficient basis for making a determination. When the State or 
local agency determines that it is necessary, the agency may conduct an 
investigation of good-cause claims to determine that good cause does or 
does not exist.
    (h) If it conducts an investigation of a good-cause claim, the State 
or local agency will:
    (1) Contact the absent parent or putative father from whom support 
would be sought if such contact is determined to be necessary to 
establish the good-cause claim; and
    (2) Prior to making such necessary contact, notify the applicant or 
recipient to enable the applicant or recipient to:
    (i) Present additional corroborative evidence or information so that 
contact with the parent or putative father becomes unnecessary;
    (ii) Withdraw the application for assistance or have the case 
closed; or
    (iii) have the good-cause claim denied.

Sec. 232.49  Enforcement without the caretaker's cooperation.

    The State plan may provide that:

for medical services could proceed without risk of harm to the child or 
caretaker relative if the enforcement or collection activities did not 
involve their participation;
    (b) This determination will be in writing, contain the agency's 
findings and basis for determination, and be entered into the AFDC case

in pursuit of liable third parties, it will notify the applicant or 
recipient to enable such individual to withdraw his or her application 
for assistance or have the case closed; and
    (d) Prior to making this determination under this paragraph, the 
State or local agency will afford the IV-D agency or the title XIX 
agency an opportunity to review and comment on the findings and basis

        Appendix A to Part 232--Model Two-Part Good Cause Notice

    This suggested two-part notice format meets the notice requirements 
of Sec. 232.40(b)(2). The first notice should be provided prior to 
requiring the applicant's or recipient's cooperation. The second notice 
should be primarily provided if the applicant or recipient so requests 
or following a claim of good cause. Receipt of the notice will be 
acknowledged by the applicant's or recipient's and the worker's 
signature. The signed copy should be placed in the AFDC case record with 
one copy retained by the applicant or recipient.
    Before being used by a State, this model should be adapted by 
substituting the appropriate agencies' names.

  Notice of Requirement To Cooperate and Right To Claim Good Cause for 
Refusal To Cooperate in Identifying and Providing Information To Assist 
 States in Pursuit of Third Parties Liable for Medical Services, and in 
                       Child Support Enforcement.

                  Benefits of Child Support Enforcement

    Your cooperation in the child support enforcement process may be of 
value to you and your child because it might result in the following 
benefits:
    <bullet> Finding the absent parent;
    <bullet> Legally establishing your child's paternity;
    <bullet> The possibility that support payments might be higher than 
your welfare grant; and
    <bullet> The possibility that you and your children may obtain 
rights to future social security, veterans, or other government 
benefits.

[[Page 81]]

                      What is Meant by Cooperation?

    The law requires you to cooperate with the welfare, child support 
and Medicaid agencies to get any support (financial or medical) owed to 
you and any of the children for whom you want AFDC, unless you have good 
cause for not cooperating.
    In cooperating with the welfare, child support and Medicaid 
agencies, you may be asked to do one or more of the following things:
    <bullet> Name the parent of any child applying for or receiving 
AFDC, and give information you have to help find the parents;
    <bullet> Help determine legally who the father is if your child was 
born out of wedlock;
    <bullet> Give help to obtain money owed to you or the children 
receiving AFDC;
    <bullet> Pay the State any money which is given directly to you by 
the absent parent (you will continue to get your full AFDC grant from 
the State); and
    <bullet> Identify and provide information to assist the State in the 
pursuit of any third party who may be liable to pay for medical care and 
services.
    You may be required to come to the welfare office, child support 
office, court or the State Medicaid agency to sign papers or give 
necessary information.

                      What is Meant by Good Cause?

    You may have good cause not to cooperate in the State's efforts to 
collect child support and to provide information to assist the State in 
pursuing third party liability. You may be excused from cooperating if 
you believe that cooperation would not be in the best interest of your 
child, and if you can provide evidence to support this claim.

         If You Do Not Cooperate and You Do Not Have Good Cause

    <bullet> You will be ineligible for AFDC.
    <bullet> Your children will still be eligible for AFDC for their own 
needs. Your children's benefits will go to another person, called a 
``protective payee.''

                  How and When You May Claim Good Cause

    <bullet> If you want to claim good cause, you must tell a worker 
that you think that you have good cause. You can do this at any time you 
believe you have good cause not to cooperate.
    <bullet> If you claim ``good cause'' you must be given another 
notice. This second notice will explain the circumstances under which 
the Welfare Agency may find good cause, and the type of evidence or 
other information the Welfare Agency needs to decide your claim. You may 
also ask for this second notice to help you decide whether or not to 
claim good cause.
    I have read this notice concerning my right to claim good cause for 
refusing to cooperate.

 Second Notice of Right To Claim Good Cause for Refusal To Cooperate in 
Identifying and Providing Information to Assist the State in Pursuit of 
    Third Parties Liable for Medical Services, and in Child Support 
                               Enforcement

    You may claim to have good cause for refusing to cooperate if you 
believe that such cooperation would not be in the best interests of your 
child. The following are circumstances under which the Welfare Agency 
may determine that you have good cause for refusing to cooperate:
    <bullet> Cooperation is anticipated to result in serious physical or 
emotional harm to the child;
    <bullet> Cooperation is anticipated to result in physical or 
emotional harm to you which is so serious it reduces your ability to 
care for the child adequately;
    <bullet> The child was born after forcible rape or incest;
    <bullet> Court proceedings are going on for adoption of the child; 
or
    <bullet> You are working with an agency helping you to decide 
whether to place the child for adoption.

                           Proving Good Cause

    It is your responsibility to:
    <bullet> Provide the Welfare Agency with the evidence needed to 
determine whether you have good cause for refusing to cooperate (If your 
reason for claiming good cause is your fear of physical harm and it is 
impossible to obtain evidence, the Welfare Agency may still be able to 
make a good cause determination after an investigation of your claim).
    <bullet> Give the necessary evidence to the agency within 20 days 
after claiming good cause. The Welfare Agency will give you more time 
only if it determines that more than 20 days are required because of the 
difficulty in obtaining the evidence.
    The Welfare Agency may:
    <bullet> Decide your claim based on the evidence which you give to 
the agency, or
    <bullet> Decide to conduct an investigation to further verify your 
claim. If the Welfare Agency decides an investigation is needed, you may 
be required to give information, such as the absent parent's name and 
address, to help the investigation. The agency

[[Page 82]]

will not contact the absent parent without first telling you.

    Note:  If you are an applicant for assistance, you will not receive 
your share of the grant until you have given the agency the evidence 
needed to support your claim, and, if requested, the information needed 
to permit an investigation of your claim.

                     Examples of Acceptable Evidence

    The following are examples of acceptable kinds of evidence the 
Welfare Agency can use in determining if good cause exists.
    If you need help in getting a copy of any of the documents, ask the 
Welfare Agency. The Welfare Agency will give you reasonable assistance 
which is needed to help you obtain the necessary documents to support 
your claim.
    <bullet> Birth certificates, or medical or law enforcement records, 
which indicate that the child was conceived as the result of incest or 
forcible rape;
    <bullet> Court documents or other records which indicate that legal 
proceedings for adoption are pending in court;
    <bullet> Court, medical, criminal, child protective services, social 
services, psychological, or law enforcement records which indicate that 
the alleged or absent parent might inflict physical or emotional harm on 
you or the child;
    <bullet> Medical records which indicate emotional health history and 
present health status of you or the child for whom support would be 
sought; or written statements from a mental health professional 
indicating a diagnosis or prognosis concerning the emotional health of 
you or the child;
    <bullet> A written statement from a public or private agency 
confirming that you are being assisted in resolving the issue of whether 
to keep or give up the child for adoption; and
    <bullet> Sworn statements from individuals, including friends, 
neighbors, clergymen, social workers, and medical professionals who 
might have knowledge of the circumstances providing the basis of your 
good cause claim.

 Child Support Agency and Medicaid Agency Participation and Enforcement

    The Child Support Enforcement Agency or the Medicaid Agency may 
review the welfare agency's findings and the basis for a good cause 
determination in your case. If you request a hearing regarding this 
issue of good cause for refusing to cooperate, the Child Support 
Enforcement Agency or the Medicaid Agency may participate in that 
hearing.
    The Notice must include one of the following statements, as 
applicable depending on the State plan option chosen. See Sec. 232.49.
    Option 1. If you are found to have good cause for not cooperating, 
the Child Support Enforcement Agency may attempt to establish paternity 
or collect support and the State Medicaid Agency may attempt to collect 
third party information and pursue third parties potentially liable for 
medical services only if the welfare agency determines that this can be 
done without risk to you or your child. This will not be done without 
first telling you.
    Option 2. If you are found to have good cause for not cooperating, 
the Child Support Enforcement Agency will not attempt to establish 
paternity or collect support and, as appropriate, the State Medicaid 
Agency may not pursue third parties potentially liable for medical 
services.
    I have read this notice concerning my right to claim good cause for 
refusing to cooperate.

<R05>
Sec. 233.10  General provisions regarding coverage and eligibility.

    (a) State plan requirements. A State plan under title I, IV--A, X, 
XIV, or XVI, of the Social Security Act must:
    (1) Specify the groups of individuals, based on reasonable 
classifications, that will be included in the program, and all the 
conditions of eligibility that must be met by the individuals in the 
groups. The groups selected for inclusion in the plan and the 
eligibility conditions imposed must not exclude individuals or groups on 
an arbitrary or unreasonable basis, and must not result in inequitable 
treatment of individuals or groups in the light of the provisions and 
purposes of the public assistance titles of the Social Security Act. 
Under this requirement:
    (i) A State shall impose each condition of eligibility required by 
the Social Security Act; and
    (ii) A State may:
    (A) Provide more limited public assistance coverage than that 
provided by the Act only where the Social Security Act or its 
legislative history authorizes more limited coverage;
    (B) Impose conditions upon applicants for and recipients of public 
assistance which, if not satisfied, result in the denial or termination 
of public assistance, if such conditions assist the State in the 
efficient administration of its public assistance programs, or further 
an independent State welfare policy, and are not inconsistent with the 
provisions and purposes of the Social Security Act.
    (iii) There must be clarity as to what groups are included in the 
plan, and which are within, and which are outside, the scope of Federal 
financial participation.
    (iv) Eligibility conditions must be applied on a consistent and 
equitable basis throughout the State.
    (v) A plan under title XVI must have the same eligibility conditions 
and other requirements for the aged, blind, and disabled, except as 
otherwise specifically required or permitted by the Act.
    (vi) Eligibility conditions or agency procedures or methods must not 
preclude the opportunity for an individual to apply and obtain a 
determination of eligibility or ineligibility.
    (vii) Methods of determining eligibility must be consistent with the 
objective of assisting all eligible persons to qualify.
    (2) Provide that the State agency will establish methods for 
identifying the expenditures for assistance for any groups included in 
the plan for whom Federal financial participation in assistance may not 
be claimed.
    (3) In addition, a State plan under title IV-A, X, XIV, or XVI of 
the Act, must: Provided that no aid or assistance will be provided under 
the plan to an individual with respect to a period for which he is 
receiving aid or assistance under a State plan approved under any other 
of such titles or under title I of the Act.

[[Page 84]]

    (b) Federal financial participation. (1) The provisions which govern 
Federal financial participation in assistance payments are set forth in 
the Social Security Act, throughout this chapter, and in other policy 
issuances of the Secretary. Where indicated, State plan provisions are 
prerequisite to Federal financial participation with respect to the 
applicable group and payments. State plan provisions on need, the amount 
of assistance, and eligibility determine the limits of Federal financial 
participation. Federal financial participation is excluded from 
assistance payments in which the State refuses to participate because of 
the failure of a local authority to apply such State plan provisions.
    (2) The following is a summary statement regarding the groups for 
whom Federal financial participation is available. (More detailed 
information is given elsewhere.)
    (i) OAA--for needy individuals under the plan who are 65 years of 
age or older.
    (ii) AFDC--for:
    (a) Needy children under the plan who are:
    (1) Under the age of 18, or age 18 if a full-time student in a 
secondary school, or in the equivalent level of vocational or technical 
training, and reasonably expected to complete the program before 
reaching age 19;
    (2) Deprived of parental support or care by reason of the death, 
continued absence from the home, or physical or mental incapacity of a 
parent, or unemployment of a principal earner, and
    (3) Living in the home of a parent or of certain relatives specified 
in the Act.
    (b) The parent(s) of a dependent child, a caretaker relative (other 
than a parent) of a dependent child, and, in certain situations, a 
parent's spouse.
    (iii) AB--for needy individual's under the plan who are blind.
    (iv) APTD--for needy individuals under the plan who are 18 years of 
age or older and permanently and totally disabled.
    (v) AABD--for needy individuals under the plan who are aged, blind, 
or 18 years of age or older and permanently and totally disabled.
    (3) Federal financial participation is available in assistance 
payments made for the entire month in accordance with the State plan if 
the individual was eligible for a portion of the month, provided that 
the individual was eligible on the date that the payment was made; 
except that where it has been determined that the State agency had 
previously denied assistance to which the individual was entitled, 
Federal financial participation will be provided in any corrective 
payment regardless of whether the individual is eligible on the date 
that the corrective payment is made.
    (4) Federal financial participation is available in assistance 
payments which are continued in accordance with the State plan, for a 
temporary period during which the effects of an eligibility condition 
are being overcome, e.g., blindness in AB, disability in APTD, physical 
or mental incapacity, continued absence of a parent, or unemployment of 
a principal earner in AFDC.
    (5) Where changed circumstances or a hearing decision makes the 
individual ineligible for any assistance, or eligible for a smaller 
amount of assistance than was actually paid, Federal financial 
participation is available in excess payments to such individuals, for 
not more than one month following the month in which the circumstances 
changed or the hearing decision was rendered. Federal financial 
participation is available where assistance is required to be continued 
unadjusted because a hearing has been requested.

<R05>
Sec. 233.20  Need and amount of assistance.

    (a) Requirements for State Plans. A State Plan for OAA, AFDC, AB, 
APTD or AABD must, as specified below:
    (1) General. (i) Provide that the determination of need and amount 
of assistance for all applicants and recipients will be made on an 
objective and equitable basis and all types of income will be taken into 
consideration in the

[[Page 85]]

same way except where otherwise specifically authorized by Federal 
statute and
    (ii) Provide that the needs, income, and resources of individuals 
receiving SSI benefits under title XVI, individuals with respect to whom 
Federal foster care payments are made, individuals with respect to whom 
State or local foster care payments are made, individuals with respect 
to whom Federal adoption assistance payments are made, or individuals 
with respect to whom State or local adoption assistance payments are 
made, for the period for which such benefits or payments are received, 
shall not be included in determining the need and the amount of the 
assistance payment of an AFDC assistance unit; except that the needs, 
income, and resources of an individual with respect to whom Federal 
adoption assistance payments are made, or individuals with respect to 
whom State or local adoption assistance payments are made are included 
in determining the need and the amount of the assistance payment for an 
AFDC assistance unit of which the individual would otherwise be regarded 
as a member where the amount of the assistance payment that the unit 
would receive would not be reduced by including the needs, income, and 
resources of such individual. Under this requirement, ``individuals 
receiving SSI benefits under title XVI'' include individuals receiving 
mandatory or optional State supplementary payments under section 1616(a) 
of the Social Security Act or under section 212 of Public Law 93-66, and 
``individuals with respect to whom Federal foster care payments are 
made'' means a child with respect to whom Federal foster care 
maintenance payments under section 472(b) and defined in section 
475(4)(A) of title IV-E of the Social Security Act are made, and a child 
whose costs in a foster family home or child care institution are 
covered by the Federal foster care maintenance payments made with 
respect to his or her minor parent under sections 472(h) and 475(4)(B) 
of title IV-E. ``Individuals with respect to whom Federal adoption 
assistance payments are made'' means a child who receives payments made 
under an approved title IV-E plan based on an adoption assistance 
agreement between the State and the adoptive parents of a child with 
special needs, pursuant to sections 473 and 475(3) of the Social 
Security Act.
    (iii) For AFDC, when an individual who is required to be included in 
the assistance unit pursuant to Sec. 206.10(a)(1)(vii) is also required 
to be included in another assistance unit, those assistance units must 
be consolidated, and treated as one assistance unit for purposes of 
determining eligibility and the amount of payment.
    (iv) For AFDC, when a State learns of an individual who is required 
to be included in the assistance unit after the date he or she is 
required to be included in the unit, the State must redetermine the 
assistance unit's eligibility and payment amount, including the need, 
income, and resources of the individual. This redetermination must be 
retroactive to the date that the individual was required to be in the 
assistance unit either through birth/adoption or by becoming a member of 
the household. Any resulting overpayment must be recovered or corrective 
payment made pursuant to Sec. 233.20(a)(13).
    (v) In determining need and the amount of payment for AFDC, all 
income and resources of an individual required to be in the assistance 
unit, but subject to sanction under Sec. 250.34 or because of an 
intentional program violation under the optional fraud control program 
implementing section 416 of the Social Security Act, are considered 
available to the assistance unit to the same extent that they would be 
if the person were not subject to a sanction. However, the needs of the 
sanctioned individual(s) are not considered. In accord with 
Sec. 250.34(c), if a parent in an AFDC-UP case is sanctioned pursuant to 
Sec. 233.100(a)(5), the needs of the second parent are not taken into 
account in determining the family's need for assistance and the amount 
of the assistance payment unless the second parent is participating in 
the JOBS program. An individual required to be in an assistance unit 
pursuant to Sec. 206.10(a)(1)(vii) but who fails to cooperate in meeting 
a condition of his or her eligibility for assistance is a sanctioned 
individual whose needs, income,

[[Page 86]]

and resources are treated in the manner described above.
    (2) Standards of assistance. (i) Specify a statewide standard, 
expressed in money amounts, to be used in determining (a) the need of 
applicants and recipients and (b) the amount of the assistance payment.
    (ii) In the AFDC plan, provide that by July 1, 1969, the State's 
standard of assistance for the AFDC program will have been adjusted to 
reflect fully changes in living costs since such standards were 
established, and any maximums that the State imposes on the amount of 
aid paid to families will have been proportionately adjusted. In such 
adjustment a consolidation of the standard (i.e., combining of items) 
may not result in a reduction in the content of the standard. In the 
event the State is not able to meet need in full under the adjusted 
standard, the State may make ratable reductions in accordance with 
paragraph (a)(3)(viii) of this section. Nevertheless, if a State 
maintains a system of dollar maximums these maximums must be 
proportionately adjusted in relation to the updated standards.
    (iii) Provide that the standard will be uniformly applied throughout 
the State except as provided under Sec. 239.54.
    (iv) Include the method used in determining need and the amount of 
the assistance payment. For AFDC, the method must provide for rounding 
down to the next lower whole dollar when the result of determining the 
standard of need or the payment amount is not a whole dollar. Proration 
under Sec. 206.10(a)(6)(i)(D) to determine the amount of payment for the 
month of application must occur before rounding to determine the payment 
amount for that month.
    (v) If the State IV-A agency includes special need items in its 
standard:
    (A) Describe those that will be recognized and the circumstances 
under which they will be included, and
    (B) Provide that they will be considered for all applicants and 
recipients requiring them; except that:
    (1) Under AFDC, work expenses and child care (or care of 
incapacitated adults living in the same home and receiving AFDC) 
resulting from employment or participation in either a CWEP or an 
employment search program cannot be special needs, and
    (2) In a State which has a JOBS program under part 250, child care, 
transportation, work-related expenses, other work-related supportive 
services, and the costs of education (including tuition, books, and 
fees) resulting from participation in JOBS (including participation 
pursuant to Secs. 250.46, 250.47, and 250.48) or any other education or 
training activity cannot be special needs.
    (vi) If the State chooses to establish the need of the individual on 
a basis that recognizes, as essential to his well-being, the presence in 
the home of other needy individuals, (A) specify the persons whose needs 
will be included in the individual's need, and (B) provide that the 
decision as to whether any individual will be recognized as essential to 
the recipient's well-being shall rest with the recipient.
    (vii) [Reserved]
    (viii) Provide that the money amount of any need item included in 
the standard will not be prorated or otherwise reduced solely because of 
the presence in the household of a non-legally responsible individual; 
and the agency will not assume any contribution from such individual for 
the support of the assistance unit except as provided in paragraphs 
(a)(3)(xiv) and (a)(5) of this section and Sec. 233.51 of this part.
    (ix) For AFDC, provide that a State shall consider utility payments 
made in lieu of any direct rental payment to a landlord or public 
housing agency to be shelter costs for applicants or recipients living 
in housing assisted under the U.S. Housing Act of 1937, as amended, and 
section 236 of the National Housing Act. The amount considered as a 
shelter payment shall not exceed the total amount the applicant or 
recipient is expected to contribute for the cost of housing as 
determined by HUD. Utility payments means only those payments made 
directly to a utility company or supplier which are for gas, 
electricity, water, heating fuel, sewerage systems, and trash and 
garbage collection. Utility payments are made ``in lieu of any direct 
rental payment to a landlord or public housing agency'' when, and only 
when, the AFDC family pays its entire required

[[Page 87]]

contribution at HUD's direction to one or more utility companies and 
does not make any direct payment to the landlord or the public housing 
agency. Housing covered by ``the U.S. Housing Act of 1937, as amended, 
and section 236 of the National Housing Act'' means Department of 
Housing and Urban Development assisted housing which includes Indian and 
public housing, section 8 new and existing rental housing, and section 
236 rental housing.
    (3) Income and resources. (i) (A) OAA, AB, APTD, AABD, Specify the 
amount and types of real and personal property, including liquid assets, 
that may be reserved, i.e., retained to meet the current and future 
needs while assistance is received on a continuing basis. In addition to 
the home, personal effects, automobile and income producing property 
allowed by the agency, the amount of real and personal property, 
including liquid assets, that can be reserved for each individual 
recipient shall not be in excess of two thousand dollars. Policies may 
allow reasonable proportions of income from businesses or farms to be 
used to increase capital assets, so that income may be increased; and 
(B) in AFDC--The amount of real and personal property that can be 
reserved for each assistance unit shall not be in excess of one thousand 
dollars equity value (or such lesser amount as the State specifies in 
its State plan) excluding only:
    (1) The home which is the usual residence of the assistance unit;
    (2) One automobile, up to $1,500 of equity value or such lower limit 
as the State may specify in the State plan; (any excess equity value 
must be applied towards the general resource limit specified in the 
State plan);
    (3) One burial plot (as defined in the State plan) for each member 
of the assistance unit;
    (4) Bona fide funeral agreements (as defined and within limits 
specified in the State plan) up to a total of $1,500 in equity value or 
such lower limit as the State may specify in the State plan for each 
member of the assistance unit (any excess equity value must be applied 
towards the general resource limit specified in the State plan). This 
provision addresses only formal agreements for funeral and burial 
expenses such as burial contracts, burial trusts or other funeral 
arrangements (generally with licensed funeral directors) and does not 
apply to other assets (e.g., passbook bank accounts, simple set-aside of 
savings, and cash surrender value of life insurance policies);
    (5) Real property for a period of six consecutive months (or, at the 
option of the State, nine consecutive months) which the family is making 
a good faith effort (as defined in the State plan) to sell, subject to 
the following provisions. The family must sign an agreement to dispose 
of the property and to repay the amount of aid received during such 
period that would not have been paid had the property been sold at the 
beginning of such period, but not to exceed the amount of the net 
proceeds of the sale. The family has five working days from the date it 
realizes cash from the sale of the excess real property to repay the 
overpayment; failure to make repayment within this period results in the 
cash being considered to be an available resource. If the family becomes 
ineligible for AFDC for any other reason during the conditional payment 
period while making a good faith effort to sell the property, or fails 
to sell the property by the end of the period despite such a good faith 
effort, then the amount of the overpayment attributable to the real 
property will not be determined and recovery will not be begun until the 
property is, in fact, sold. However, if the property was intentionally 
sold at less than fair market value so that a good faith effort to sell 
it was not made, or if it is otherwise determined that a good faith 
effort to sell the property is not being made, the overpayment amount 
shall be computed using the fair market value determined at the 
beginning of the period. For applicants, the conditional payment period 
begins with the first payment month for which all otherwise applicable 
eligibility conditions are met and payment is authorized. For recipients 
who acquire property while receiving assistance, the period begins with 
the payment month in which the recipient receives the property; and
    (6) At State option, basic maintenance items essential to day-to-day 
living such as clothes, furniture and

[[Page 88]]

other similarly essential items of limited value.
    (ii) Provide that in determining need and the amount of the 
assistance payment, after all policies governing the reserves and 
allowances and disregard or setting aside of income and resources 
referred to in this section have been uniformly applied:
    (A) In determining need, all remaining income and resources shall be 
considered in relation to the State's need standard;
    (B) In determining financial eligibility and the amount of the 
assistance payment all remaining income (except unemployment 
compensation received by an unemployed principal earner) and, except for 
AFDC, all resources may be considered in relation to either the State's 
need standard or the State's payment standard. Unemployment compensation 
received by an unemployed principal earner shall be considered only by 
subtracting it from the amount of the assistance payment after the 
payment has been determined under the State's payment method;
    (C) States may have policies which provide for allocating an 
individual's income for his or her own support if the individual is not 
applying for or receiving assistance; for the support of other 
individuals living in the same household but not receiving assistance; 
and for the support of other individuals living in another household. 
Such other individuals are those who are or could be claimed by the 
individual as dependents for determining Federal personal income tax 
liability, or those he or she is legally obligated to support. No income 
may be allocated to meet the needs of an individual who has been 
sanctioned under Secs. 224.51, 232.11(a)(2), 232.12(d), 238.22 or 240.22 
or who is required to be included in the assistance unit and has failed 
to cooperate. The amount allocated for the individual and the other 
individuals who are living in the home must not exceed the State's need 
standard amount for a family group of the same composition. The amount 
allocated for individuals not living in the home must not exceed the 
amount actually paid.
    (D) Income after application of disregards, except as provided in 
paragraph (a)(3)(xiii) of this section, and resources available for 
current use shall be considered. To the extent not inconsistent with any 
other provision of this chapter, income and resources are considered 
available both when actually available and when the applicant or 
recipient has a legal interest in a liquidated sum and has the legal 
ability to make such sum available for support and maintenance.
    (E) For AFDC, income tax refunds, but such payments shall be 
considered as resources; and
    (F) When the AFDC assistance unit's income, after applying 
applicable disregards, exceeds the State need standard for the family 
because of receipt of nonrecurring earned or unearned lump sum income 
(including for AFDC, title II and other retroactive monthly benefits, 
and payments in the nature of a windfall, e.g., inheritances or lottery 
winnings, personal injury and worker compensation awards, to the extent 
it is not earmarked and used for the purpose for which it is paid, i.e., 
monies for back medical bills resulting from accidents or injury, 
funeral and burial costs, replacement or repair of resources, etc.), the 
family will be ineligible for aid for the full number of months derived 
by dividing the sum of the lump sum income and other income by the 
monthly need standard for a family of that size. Any income remaining 
from this calculation is income in the first month following the period 
of ineligibility. The period of ineligibility shall begin with the month 
of receipt of the nonrecurring income or, at State option, as late as 
the corresponding payment month. For purposes of applying the lump sum 
provision, family includes all persons whose needs are taken into 
account in determining eligibility and the amount of the assistance 
payment, and includes solely for determining the income and resources of 
a family an individual who must be in a family pursuant to 
Sec. 206.10(a)(1)(vii) but who does not meet a condition of his or her 
eligibility due to a failure to cooperate or is required by law to have 
his or her needs excluded from an assistance unit's AFDC grant 
calculation due to the failure to perform some action. A State may

[[Page 89]]

shorten the remaining period of ineligibility when: the standard of need 
increases and the amount the family would have received also changes 
(e.g., situations involving additions to the family unit during the 
period of ineligibility of persons who are otherwise eligible for 
assistance); the lump sum income or a portion thereof becomes 
unavailable to the family for a reason beyond the control of the family; 
or the family incurs and pays for medical expenses. If the State chooses 
to shorten the period of ineligibility, the State plan shall:
    (1) Identify which of the above situations are included;
    (2) In the case of situations involving an increase in the need 
standard and changes in the amount that should have been paid to the 
family, specify the types of circumstances which will be included;
    (3) In the case of situations involving the unavailability of the 
lump sum income, include a definition of unavailability, and specify 
what reasons will be considered beyond the control of the family; and
    (4) In the case of situations involving the payment of medical 
expenses, specify the types of medical expenses the State will allow to 
be offset against the lump sum income.


For purposes of this paragraph (a)(3): Automobile means a passenger car 
or other motor vehicle used to provide transportation of persons or 
goods. (In AFDC, in appropriate geographic areas, one alternate primary 
mode of transportation may be substituted for the automobile); Equity 
value means fair market value minus encumbrances (legal debts); Fair 
market value means the price an item of a particular make, model, size, 
material or condition will sell for on the open market in the geographic 
area involved (If a motor vehicle is especially equipped with apparatus 
for the handicapped, the apparatus shall not increase the value of the 
vehicle); Liquid assets are those properties in the form of cash or 
other financial instruments which are convertible to cash and include 
savings accounts, checking accounts, stocks, bonds, mutual fund shares, 
promissory notes, mortgages, cash value of insurance policies, and 
similar properties; Need standard means the money value assigned by the 
State to the basic and special needs it recognizes as essential for 
applicants and recipients; Payment standard means the amount from which 
non-exempt income is subtracted.

    (iii) States may prorate income received by individuals employed on 
a contractual basis over the period of the contract or may prorate 
intermittent income received quarterly, semiannually, or yearly over the 
period covered by the income. In OAA, AB, APTD and AABD, they may use 
the prorated amount to determine need under Sec. 233.23 and the amount 
of the assistance payment under Secs. 233.24 and 233.25. In AFDC, they 
may use the prorated amount to determine need under Sec. 233.33 and the 
amount of the assistance payment under Secs. 233.34 and 233.35.
    (iv) Provide that in determining the availability of income and 
resources, the following will not be included as income:
    (A) Except for AFDC, income equal to expenses reasonably 
attributable to the earning of income (including earnings from public 
service employment);
    (B) Grants, such as scholarships, obtained and used under conditions 
that preclude their use for current living costs;
    (C) Home produce of an applicant or recipient, utilized by him and 
his household for their own consumption;
    (D) For AFDC, any amounts paid by a State IV-A agency from State-
only funds to meet needs of children receiving AFDC, if the payments are 
made under a statutorily-established State program which has been 
continuously in effect since before January 1, 1979;
    (E) For AFDC, income tax refunds, but such payments shall be 
considered as resources; and
    (F) At State option, small nonrecurring gifts, such as those for 
Christmas, birthdays and graduations, not to exceed $30 per recipient in 
any quarter; and
    (G) For AFDC, the amount paid to the family by the IV-A agency under 
Sec. 232.20(d) or, in a State that treats direct support payments as 
income under Sec. 233.20(a)(3)(v)(B), the first $50 received by the 
assistance unit which represents a current monthly support obligation

[[Page 90]]

or a voluntary support payment. In no case shall the total amount 
disregarded exceed $50 per month per assistance unit.
    (v) Provide that agency policies will assure that:
    (A) In determining eligibility for an assistance payment, support 
payments assigned under Sec. 232.11 of this chapter will be treated in 
accordance with Sec. 232.20 and Sec. 232.21 of this chapter; and
    (B) In determining the amount of an assistance payment, assigned 
support payments retained in violation of Sec. 232.12(b)(4) of this 
chapter, will be counted as income to meet need unless the approved IV-A 
State plan provides that such support payments are subject to IV-D 
recovery under Secs. 302.31(a)(3) and 303.80 of this title or unless 
such payments are sufficient to render the family ineligible as provided 
at Sec. 232.20 of this chapter.
    (vi)(A) In family groups living together, income of the spouse is 
considered available for his spouse and income of a parent is considered 
available for children under 21, except as provided in paragraphs 
(a)(3)(xiv) and (a)(3)(xviii) of this section for AFDC. If an individual 
is a spouse or parent who is a recipient of SSI benefits under title 
XVI, an individual with respect to whom Federal foster care payments are 
made, an individual with respect to whom State or local foster care 
payments are made, an individual with respect to whom Federal adoption 
assistance payments are made, or an individual with respect to whom 
State or local adoption assistance payments are made, then, for the 
period for which such benefits or payments are received, his or her 
income and resources shall not be counted as income and resources 
available to the AFDC unit except that a child receiving adoption 
assistance payments will not be excluded if such exclusion would cause 
the AFDC benefits of the assistance unit of which the child would 
otherwise be considered a member to be reduced. For purposes of this 
exception, ``a recipient of SSI benefits under title XVI'' includes a 
spouse or parent receiving mandatory or optional State supplementary 
payments under section 1616(a) of the Social Security Act or under 
section 212 of Public Law 93-66 and an ``individual with respect to whom 
Federal foster care payments are made'' means a child with respect to 
whom Federal foster care maintenance payments are made under section 
472(b) and defined in section 475(4)(A) of the Act, and a child whose 
costs in a foster family home or child-care institution are covered by 
the foster care maintenance payments made with respect to his or her 
minor parent under sections 472(h) and 475(4)(B) of the Act. 
``Individuals with respect to whom Federal adoption assistance payments 
are made'' means a child who receives payments made under an approved 
title IV-E plan based on an adoption assistance agreement between the 
State and the adoptive parents of a child with special needs, pursuant 
to sections 473 and 475(3) of the Social Security Act.
    (B) Income of an alien parent, who is disqualified pursuant to 
Sec. 233.50(c) is considered available to the otherwise eligible child 
by applying the stepparent deeming formula at 45 CFR 233.20(a)(3)(xiv).
    (vii) If the State agency establishes policy under which assistance 
from other agencies and organizations will not be deducted in 
determining the amount of assistance to be paid, provide that no 
duplication shall exist between such other assistance and that provided 
by the public assistance agency. In such complementary program 
relationships, nonduplication shall be assured by provision that such 
aid will be considered in relation to: (a) The different purpose for 
which the other agency grants aid such as vocational rehabilitation; (b) 
the provision of goods and services that are not included in the 
statewide standard of the public assistance agency, e.g., a private 
agency might provide money for special training for a child or for 
medical care when the public assistance agency does not carry this 
responsibility; or housing and urban development payments might be 
provided to cover moving expenses that are not included in the 
assistance standard; or (c) the fact that public assistance funds are 
insufficient to meet the total amount of money determined to be needed 
in accordance with the statewide standard. In such instances, grants by 
other agencies in an amount sufficient to

[[Page 91]]

make it possible for the individual to have the amount of money 
determined to be needed, in accordance with the public assistance agency 
standard, will not constitute duplication.
    (viii) Provide that: (A) Payment will be based on the determination 
of the amount of assistance needed; (B) if full individual payments are 
precluded by maximums or insufficient funds, adjustments will be made by 
methods applied uniformly statewide; (C) in the case of AFDC no payment 
of aid shall be made to an assistance unit in any month in which the 
amount of aid prior to any adjustments is determined to be less than 
$10; and (D) an individual who is denied aid because of the limitation 
specified in (C) of this section, or because the payment amount is 
determined to be zero as a result of rounding the payment amount as 
required by Sec. 233.20(a)(2)(iv), shall be deemed a recipient of aid 
for all other purposes except participation in the Community Work 
Experience Program.
    (ix) Provide that the agency will establish and carry out policies 
with reference to applicants' and recipients' potential sources of 
income that can be developed to a state of availability.
    (x) Provide that the income and resources of individuals receiving 
SSI benefits under title XVI, individuals with respect to whom Federal 
foster care payments are made, individuals with respect to whom State or 
local foster care payments are made, individuals with respect to whom 
Federal adoption assistance payments are made, or individuals with 
respect to whom State or local adoption assistance payments are made, 
for the period for which such benefits or payments are received, shall 
not be counted as income and resources of an assistance unit applying 
for or receiving assistance under title IV-A; except that a child 
receiving adoption assistance payments will not be excluded if such 
exclusion would cause the AFDC benefits of the assistance unit of which 
the child would otherwise be considered a member to be reduced. Under 
this requirement, ``individuals receiving SSI benefits under title XVI'' 
include individuals receiving mandatory or optional State supplementary 
payments under section 1616(a) of the Social Security Act or under 
section 212 of Public Law 93-66 and, ``individuals with respect to whom 
Federal foster care payments are made'' means a child with respect to 
whom Federal foster care maintenance payments are made under section 
472(b) and defined in section 475(4)(A) of the Act, and a child whose 
costs in a foster family home or child-care institution are covered by 
foster care maintenance payments made with respect to his or her minor 
parent under sections 472(h) and 475(4)(B) of the Act. ``Individuals 
with respect to whom Federal adoption assistance payments are made'' 
means a child who receives payments made under an approved title IV-E 
plan based on an adoption assistance agreement between the State and the 
adoptive parents of a child with special needs, pursuant to sections 473 
and 475(3) of the Social Security Act.
    (xi) In the case of AFDC if the State chooses to count the value of 
the food stamp coupons as income, provide that the State plan shall:
    (A) Identify the amount for food included in its need and payment 
standards for an assistance unit of the same size and composition. 
(States which have a flat grant system must estimate the amount based on 
historical data or some other justifiable procedure.); and
    (B) Specify the amount of such food stamp coupons that it will count 
as income. Under this requirement, the amount of food stamp coupons 
which a State may count as income may not exceed the amount for food 
established in its payment standard for an assistance unit of the same 
size and composition.
    (xii) In the case of AFDC if the State chooses to count the value of 
the governmental rent or housing subsidies as income, provide that the 
State plan shall:
    (A) Identify the amount for shelter included in its need and payment 
standards for an assistance unit of the same size and composition. 
(States which have a flat grant system must estimate this amount based 
on historical data or some other justifiable procedure.); and
    (B) Specify the amount of such housing assistance that it will count 
as income. Under this requirement, the

[[Page 92]]

amount of such rent or housing subsidies which a State may count as 
income may not exceed the amount for shelter established in its payment 
standard for assistance unit of the same size and composition.
    (xiii) Under the AFDC plan, provide that no assistance unit is 
eligible for aid in any month in which the unit's income (other than the 
assistance payment) exceeds 185 percent of the State's need standard 
(including special needs) for a family of the same composition 
(including special needs), without application of the disregards in 
paragraph (a)(11)(i) (except to the extent provided for under paragraph 
(a)(3)(xix)), paragraph (a)(11)(ii) and paragraph (a)(11)(viii) of this 
section.
    (xiv) For AFDC, in States that do not have laws of general 
applicability holding the stepparent legally responsible to the same 
extent as the natural or adoptive parent, the State agency shall count 
as income to the assistance unit the income of the stepparent (i.e., one 
who is married, under State law, to the child's parent) of an AFDC child 
who is living in the household with the child after applying the 
following disregards (exception: if the stepparent is included in the 
assistance unit, the disregard under paragraph (a)(11) (i) and (ii) of 
this section apply instead:
    (A) The first $90 of the gross earned income of the stepparent;
    (B) An additional amount for the support of the stepparent and any 
other individuals who are living in the home, but whose needs are not 
taken into account in making the AFDC eligibility determinations except 
for sanctioned individuals or individuals who are required to be 
included in the assistance unit but have failed to cooperate and are or 
could be claimed by the stepparent as dependents for purposes of 
determining his or her Federal personal income tax liability. This 
disregarded amount shall equal the State's need standard amount for a 
family group of the same composition as the stepparent and those other 
individuals described in the preceding sentence;
    (C) Amounts actually paid by the stepparent to individuals not 
living in the home but who are or could be claimed by him or her as 
dependents for purposes of determining his or her Federal personal 
income tax liability; and
    (D) Payments by such stepparent of alimony or child support with 
respect to individuals not living in the household.
    (xv) For AFDC, provide for the consideration of the income and 
resources of an alien's sponsor who is an individual as provided in 
Sec. 233.51.
    (xvi) For AFDC, provide that in considering the availability of 
income and resources, support and maintenance assistance (including home 
energy assistance) will be taken into account in accordance with 
Sec. 233.53.
    (xvii) In the case of AFDC, if the State chooses to disregard 
monthly income of any dependent child when the income is derived from 
participation in a program under the JTPA, provide that the State plan 
shall:
    (A) Identify from which programs under the JTPA, income will be 
disregarded;
    (B) In the case of earned income, specify what amount will be 
disregarded, and the length of time the disregard will be applicable (up 
to six months per calendar year); and
    (C) In the case of unearned income, specify what amount will be 
disregarded, and the length of time per calendar year the disregard will 
be applicable if any such limit is chosen.
    (xviii) For AFDC, in the case of a dependent child whose parent is a 
minor under the age of 18 (without regard to school attendance), the 
State shall count as income to the assistance unit the income, after 
appropriate disregards, of such minor's own parent(s) living in the same 
household as the minor and dependent child. The disregards to be applied 
are the same as are applied to the income of a stepparent pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(3)(xiv) of this section. However, in applying the 
disregards, each employed parent will receive the benefit of the work 
expense disregard in paragraph (a)(3)(xiv)(A) of this section.
    (xix) In the case of AFDC, if the State chooses to disregard monthly 
earned income of dependent children who are full-time students in the 
determination of whether the family's income exceeds the limit under

[[Page 93]]

Sec. 233.20(a)(3)(xiii) of this section, provide that the State plan 
shall specify what amounts will be disregarded and the length of time 
the disregard will be applicable (up to six months per calendar year) 
except that earned income derived from participation in a program under 
the JTPA may only be disregarded under this paragraph, paragraph 
(a)(3)(xvii) or a combination of both paragraphs for a total of 6 months 
per calendar year.
    (xx) In the case of AFDC, if the State chooses to disregard in the 
determination of eligibility the monthly earned income of dependent 
children applying for AFDC who are full-time students, provide that the 
State plan shall:
    (A) Specify the amount that will be disregarded, and
    (B) Provide that the disregard shall only apply to the extent that 
the earned income is also disregarded pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(xix) 
of this section.
    (xxi) Provide that the principal of a bona fide loan will not be 
counted as income or resources in the determination of eligibility and 
the amount of assistance. Interest earned on a loan is counted as 
unearned income in the month received and as resources thereafter and 
purchases made with a loan are counted as resources. For purposes of 
this paragraph, a loan is considered bona fide when it meets objective 
and reasonable criteria included in the State plan.
    (4) Disregard of income in OAA, AFDC, AB, APTD, OR AABD. (i) For all 
programs except AFDC. If the State chooses to disregard income from all 
sources before applying other provisions for disregarding or setting 
aside income, specify the amount that is first to be disregarded, but 
not more than $7.50 per month, of any income of an individual, child or 
relative claiming assistance. All income must be included such as social 
security or other benefits, earnings, contributions from relatives, or 
other income the individual may have.
    (ii) Provide that in determining eligibility for public assistance 
and the amount of the assistance payment, the following will be 
disregarded as income and resources:
    (a) In OAA, AB, APTD, and AABD, the value of the coupon allotment 
under the Food Stamp Act of 1964 in excess of the amount paid for the 
coupons;
    (b) The value of the U.S. Department of Agriculture donated foods 
(surplus commodities);
    (c) Any payment received under title II of the Uniform Relocation 
Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970;
    (d) Grants or loans to any undergraduate student for educational 
purposes made or insured under any programs administered by the 
Secretary of Education except the programs under the Carl D. Perkins 
Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act (20 U.S.C. 2301 et 
seq.). Student financial assistance provided under the Carl D. Perkins 
Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act will be disregarded in 
accordance with paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(t) of this section.
    (e) Any funds distributed per capita to or held in trust for members 
of any Indian tribe under Public Law 92-254 or Pub. L. 94-540;
    (f) Any benefits received under title VII, Nutrition Program for the 
Elderly, of the Older Americans Act of 1965, as amended;
    (g) Payments for supporting services or reimbursement of out-of-
pocket expenses made to individual volunteers serving as foster 
grandparents, senior health aides, or senior companions, and to persons 
serving in the Service Corps of Retired Executives (SCORE) and Active 
Corps of Executives (ACE) and any other programs under titles II and 
III, pursuant to section 418 of Pub. L. 93-113;
    (h) Payments to applicants or recipients participating in the 
Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA) Program, except that this 
disregard will not be applied when the Director of ACTION determines 
that the value of all such payments, adjusted to reflect the number of 
hours such volunteers are serving, is equivalent to or greater than the 
minimum wage then in effect under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 
or the minimum wage under the laws of the States where the volunteers 
are serving, whichever is greater. (Section

[[Page 94]]

404(g) of Pub. L. 93-113, as amended by section 9 of Pub. L. 96-143);
    (i) The value of supplemental food assistance received under the 
Child Nutrition Act of 1966 as amended, and the special food service 
program for children under the National School Lunch Act, as amended 
(Pub. L. 92-433 and Pub. L. 93-150);
    (j) [Reserved]
    (k) Pursuant to section 15 of Public Law 100-241, any of the 
following distributions made to a household, an individual Native, or a 
descendant of a Native by a Native Corporation established pursuant to 
the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) (Pub. L. 92-203, as 
amended):
    (1) Cash distributions (including cash dividends on stock from a 
Native Corporation) received by an individual are never counted as 
income or resources to the extent that such cash does not, in the 
aggregate, exceed $2,000 in a year. Cash which, in the aggregate, is in 
excess of $2,000 in a year is not subject to the income and resources 
disregards in this paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(k)(1);
    (2) Stock (including stock issued or distributed by a Native 
Corporation as a dividend or distribution on stock);
    (3) A partnership interest;
    (4) Land or an interest in land (including land or an interest in 
land received from a Native Corporation as a dividend or distribution on 
stock); and
    (5) An interest in a settlement trust.
    (l) Benefits paid to eligible households under the Low Income Home 
Energy Assistance Act of 1981 pursuant to section 2605(f) of Pub. L. 97-

114 (89 Stat. 577, 25 U.S.C. 459e) receipts distributed to members of 
certain Indian tribes which are referred to in section 5 of Pub. L. 94-
114 (89 Stat. 577, 25 U.S.C. 459d).
    (n) Pursuant to section 7 of Public Law 93-134, as amended by 
section 4 of Public Law 97-458, Indian judgment funds that are held in 
trust by the Secretary of the Interior (including interest and 
investment income accrued while such funds are so held in trust), or 
distributed per capita to a household or member of an Indian tribe 
pursuant to a plan prepared by the Secretary of the Interior and not 
disapproved by a joint resolution of the Congress, and initial purchases 
made with such funds. This disregard does not apply to proceeds from the 
sale of initial purchases, subsequent purchases made with funds derived 
from the sale or conversion of the initial purchases, or to funds or 
initial purchases which are inherited or transferred.
    (o) Pursuant to section 2 of Public Law 98-64, all funds held in 
trust by the Secretary of the Interior for an Indian tribe (including 
interest and investment income accrued while such funds are so held in 
trust) and distributed per capita to a household or member of an Indian 
tribe, and initial purchases made with such funds. This disregard does 
not apply to proceeds from the sale of initial purchases, subsequent 
purchases made with funds derived from the sale or conversion of initial 
purchases, or to funds or initial purchases which are inherited or 
transferred.
    (p) Any student financial assistance provided under programs in 
title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, and under

Restitution Act).
    (r) Any Federal major disaster and emergency assistance provided 
under the Disaster Relief Act of 1974, as amended by Public Law 100-707 
(the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Amendments of 1988) and 
comparable disaster assistance provided by States, local governments and 
disaster assistance organizations.
    (s) Any payments made pursuant to the settlement in the In Re Agent 
Orange Product liability litigation, M.D.L. No. 381 (E.D.N.Y.).
    (t) Student financial assistance made available for the attendance 
costs defined in this paragraph under programs in the Carl D. Perkins 
Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act (20 U.S.C. 2301 et 
seq.). Attendance costs are: tuition and fees normally assessed a 
student carrying the same academic

[[Page 95]]

workload as determined by the institution, and including costs for 
rental or purchase of any equipment, materials, or supplies required of 
all students in the same course of study; and an allowance for books, 
supplies, transportation, dependent care and miscellaneous personal 
expenses for a student attending the institution on at least a half-time 
basis, as determined by the institution.
    (u) For AFDC, any payments made pursuant to section 6(h)(2) of 
Public Law 101-426, the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act.
    (iii) Provide that income and resources which are disregarded or set 
aside under this part will not be taken into consideration in 
determining the need of any other individual for assistance.
    (iv) For AFDC, any amounts determined to have been paid by a State 
from State-only funds to supplement or otherwise increase the amount of 
aid paid to an assistance unit as computed under Sec. 233.35 for a month 
in recognition of current or anticipated needs of the assistance unit 
for that same month shall not be counted as income--to the extent that 
the total of the State supplemental payment, the AFDC payment and actual 
income (i.e., the amount of income received during the payment month 
after subtracting from gross income the $75 work expense disregard (to 
recognize mandatory payroll deductions, transportation costs, and other 
work expenses), child care and other applicable disregards) received in 
that month are not in excess of what the State would have paid for that 
month to an assistance unit of the same size and composition with no 
income--in computing the assistance payment under Sec. 233.35 for the 
corresponding payment month.
    (5) Proration of shelter, utilities, and similar needs in AFDC. (i) 
Provide that the State agency may prorate allowances in the need and 
payment standards for shelter, utilities, and similar needs when the 
AFDC assistance unit lives together with other individuals as a 
household; except that, the State shall not prorate with respect to any 
person receiving SSI to whom the statutory one-third reduction (section 
1612(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Act) is applied, or prorate when a bona fide 
landlord-tenant relationship exists. If the State chooses to prorate 
under this paragraph, it must prorate both the need standard and payment 
standard.
    (ii) If the State agency elects to prorate allowances for shelter, 
utilities, and similar needs the State plan must:
    (A) Indicate which allowances will be prorated, and describe the 
procedure which will be used to prorate the allowances;
    (B) Provide that the allowances will be prorated on a reasonable 
basis; and
    (C) Specify the circumstances under which proration will occur, 
including a description of which individuals are considered to be living 
with an AFDC assistance unit as a household.
    (6) Disregard of earned income; definition. Provide that for 
purposes of disregarding earned income the agency policies will include:
    (i) A definition of earned income in accordance with the provisions 
of paragraphs (a)(6) (iii) through (ix) of this section; and
    (ii) Provision for disregarding earned income for the period during 
which it is earned, rather than when it is paid, in cases of lump-sum 
payment for services rendered over a period of more than 1 month.
    (iii) The term earned income encompasses income in cash or in kind 
earned by an individual through the receipt of wages, salary, 
commissions, or profit from activities in which he is engaged as a self-
employed individual or as an employee. For AFDC, earned income means 
gross earned income prior to any deductions for taxes or for any other 
purposes, except as provided in paragraph (a)(6)(v). Such earned income 
may be derived from his own employment, such as a business enterprise, 
or farming; or derived from wages or salary received as an employee. It 
includes earnings over a period of time for which settlement is made at 
one given time, as in the instance of sale of farm crops, livestock, or 
poultry. For OAA, AB, APTD and AABD only, in considering income from 
farm operation, the option available for reporting under OASDI, namely 
the cash receipts and disbursements method, i.e., a record of actual 
gross, of expenses, and of net, is an individual

[[Page 96]]

determination and is acceptable also for these assistance programs.
    (iv) With reference to commissions, wages, or salary, the term 
earned income means the total amount, irrespective of personal expenses, 
such as income-tax deductions, lunches, and transportation to and from 
work, and irrespective of expenses of employment which are not personal, 
such as the cost of tools, materials, special uniforms, or 
transportation to call on customers.
    (v) (A) For OAA, AB, APTD, and AABD, with respect to self-
employment, the term earned income means the total profit from business 
enterprise, farming, etc., resulting from a comparison of the gross 
income received with the business expenses, i.e., total cost of the 
production of the income. Personal expenses, such as income-tax 
payments, lunches, and transportation to and from work, are not 
classified as business expenses.
    (B) For AFDC, with respect to self-employment the term earned income 
means the total profit from business enterprise, farming, etc., 
resulting from a comparison of the gross receipts with the business 
expenses, i.e., expenses directly related to producing the goods or 
services and without which the goods or services could not be produced. 
However, items such as depreciation, personal business and entertainment 
expenses, personal transportation, purchase of capital equipment and 
payments on the principal of loans for capital assets or durable goods 
are not business expenses.
    (vi) The definition shall exclude the following from earned income: 
Returns from capital investment with respect to which the individual is 
not himself actively engaged, as in a business (for example, under most 
circumstances, dividends and interest would be excluded from earned 
income); benefits (not in the nature of wages, salary, or profit) 
accruing as compensation, or reward for service, or as compensation for 
lack of employment (for example, pensions and benefits, such as United 
Mine Workers' benefits or veterans' benefits).
    (vii) With regard to the degree of activity, earned income is income 
produced as a result of the performance of services by a recipient; in 
other words, income which the individual earns by his own efforts, 
including managerial responsibilities, would be properly classified as 
earned income, such as management of capital investment in real estate. 
Conversely, for example, in the instance of capital investment wherein 
the individual carries no specific responsibility, such as where rental 
properties are in the hands of rental agencies and the check is 
forwarded to the recipient, the income would not be classified as earned 
income.
    (viii) Reserves accumulated from earnings are given no different 
treatment than reserves accumulated from any other sources.
    (7) Disregard of earned income; method. (i) Provide that for other 
than AFDC, the following method will be used for disregarding earned 
income: The applicable amounts of earned income to be disregarded will 
be deducted from the gross amount of earned income, and all work 
expenses, personal and non-personal, will then be deducted. Only the net 
amount remaining will be applied in determining need and the amount of 
the assistance payment.
    (ii) In applying the $30 and one-third disregard under paragraph 
(a)(11)(i)(D) of this section to an applicant for AFDC, there will be a 
preliminary step to determine whether the assistance unit is eligible 
without applying the disregard to the individual's earned income, by 
comparing the applicant's gross earned income (less the disregards in 
paragraphs (a)(11)(i) (A), (B) and (C)) and all of the assistance unit's 
other income to the State need standard. This preliminary step does not 
apply if the individual has received AFDC in one of the four months 
prior to the month of application.
    (8) Disregard of earned income applicable only to OAA, APTD, or 
AABD. If the State chooses to disregard earned income, specify the 
amount to be disregarded of the first $80 per month of income that is 
earned by an aged or disabled individual claiming OAA, APTD, or AABD, 
who is not blind, but not more than $20 per month plus one-half of the 
next $60 of such earned income.
    (9) Disregard of income and resources applicable only to APTD or 
AABD. If the

[[Page 97]]

State chooses to disregard income (which may be additional to the income 
disregarded under paragraph (a)(8) of this section) or resources for a 
disabled individual to achieve the fulfillment of a plan of self-
support, provide that the amounts of additional income and resources 
will not exceed those found necessary for the period during which the 
individual is actually undergoing vocational rehabilitation, and specify 
the period, not in excess of 36 months, for which such amounts are to be 
disregarded.
    (10) Disregard of income and resources applicable only to AB or 
AABD. Provide that, in determining the need of individuals who are 
blind, (i) the first $85 per month of earned income of the individual 
plus one-half of earned income in excess of $85 per month will be 
disregarded; and (ii) if the individual has a plan for achieving self-
support, such additional income and resources as are necessary to 
fulfill such plan will be disregarded for a period not in excess of 12 
months. Such additional income and resources may be disregarded for an 
additional period not in excess of 24 months (for a total of 36 months), 
as specified in the State plan.
    (11) Disregard of income and resources applicable only to AFDC. (i) 
For purposes of eligibility determination, the State must disregard from 
the monthly earned income, i.e., earned income as defined in 
Sec. 233.20(a)(6)(iii), of each individual whose needs are included in 
the eligibility determination:
    (A) Disregard all of the monthly earned income of each child 
receiving AFDC if the child is a full-time student or is a part-time 
student who is not a full-time employee. A student is one who is 
attending a school, college, or university or a course of vocational or 
technical training designed to fit him or her for gainful employment and 
includes a participant in the Job Corps program under the Job Training 
Partnership Act (JTPA).
    (B) The first $90.
    (C) Where appropriate, an amount equal to $30 plus one-third of the 
earned income not already disregarded under paragraphs (a)(11)(i), 
(a)(11)(v) and (a)(11)(vi) of this section of an individual who received 
assistance in one of the four prior months.
    (D) An amount equal to the actual cost for the care of each 
dependent child or incapacitated adult living in the same home and 
receiving AFDC, but not to exceed $175 for each dependent child who is 
at least age two or each incapacitated adult, and not to exceed $200 for 
each dependent child who is under age two. For individuals not engaged 
in full-time employment or not employed throughout the month, the $175 
and $200 disregard limits may be applied, or the State agency may 
establish disregard limits less than $175 and $200.
    (E) Where appropriate, $30 of the earned income not already 
disregarded under paragraphs (a)(11) (i), (v), and (vi) of this section, 
in the case of an individual who reapplies for assistance within the 
eight-month period that he/she is eligible for the $30 disregard.
    (ii) For purposes of benefit calculation for individuals found 
eligible under paragraph (a)(11)(i) of this section, the following 
disregards must be made by the State:
    (A) Disregard all of the monthly earned income of each child 
receiving AFDC if the child is a full-time student or is a part-time 
student who is not a full-time employee. A student is one who is 
attending a school, college, or university or a course of vocational or 
technical training designed to fit him or her for gainful employment and 
includes a participant in the Job Corps program under the Job Training 
Partnership Act (JTPA).
    (B) Disregard from any other individual's earned income the amounts 
specified in paragraphs (a)(11)(i)(B) and (a)(11)(i)(D) of this section, 
and $30 plus one-third of the individual's earned income not already 
disregarded under paragraphs (a)(11)(ii) and (a)(11)(v) of this section. 
However, the State may not provide the one-third portion of the 
disregard to an individual after the fourth consecutive month (any month 
for which the unit loses the $30 plus one-third disregard because of a 
provision in paragraph (a)(11)(iii) of this section, shall be considered 
as one of these months) it has been applied to the individual's earned 
income and may not apply the $30 disregard after the eighth month 
following the fourth consecutive month (regardless of whether the $30

[[Page 98]]

disregard was actually applied in those months) unless twelve 
consecutive months have passed during which the individual is not a 
recipient of AFDC. If income from a recurring source resulted in 
suspension or termination due to an extra paycheck, the month of 
ineligibility does not interrupt the accumulation of consecutive months 
of the $30 plus one-third disregard, nor does it count as one of the 
consecutive months.
    (iii) The applicable earned income disregards in paragraphs (i) (B) 
and (C) and (ii)(B) of this paragraph do not apply to the earned income 
of the individual for the month in which one of the following conditions 
apply to him:
    (A) An individual terminated his employment or reduced his earned 
income without good cause (as specified in the State plan) within the 
period of 30 days preceding such month;
    (B) An individual refused without good cause (as specified in the 
State plan) within the period of 30 days preceding such month to accept 
employment in which he is able to engage which is offered through the 
public employment offices of the State, or is otherwise offered by an 
employer if the offer of such employer is determined by the State or 
local agency administering the State plan, after notification by him, to 
be a bona fide offer of employment;
    (C) An individual failed without good cause (as specified in the 
State plan) to make a timely report (as defined in Sec. 233.37(c)) of 
that income; or
    (D) The individual voluntarily requests assistance to be terminated 
for the primary purpose of avoiding receiving the $30 and one-third 
disregard for four consecutive months.
    (iv)  [Reserved]
    (v) The treatment of earned income and expenses under JOBS is as 
follows:
    (A) For earned income from regular employment or on-the-job 
training, as described at Sec. 250.61, the disregards in paragraphs 
(a)(11)(i) and (a)(11)(ii)(B) shall apply.
    (B) For earned income from a job under the work supplementation 
component, as described at Sec. 250.62, the disregards in paragraphs 
(a)(11)(i) and (a)(11)(ii)(B) shall apply unless the State IV-A agency 
in its State JOBS plan, has elected to provide otherwise under 
Sec. 250.62(j) and Sec. 250.62(k).
    (C) For all activities under JOBS and self-initiated education and 
training in non-JOBS areas, advance payment or reimbursement to the 
individual for child care, transportation, work-related expenses, or 
work-related supportive services is disregarded.
    (D) Payment or reimbursement of child care pursuant to part 255 for 
employed individuals who are not JOBS participants and one-time work-
related expenses for individuals who are not JOBS participants pursuant 
to part 255 are disregarded.
    (vi) At State option, disregard all or part of the monthly income of 
any dependent child applying for or receiving AFDC when the income is 
derived from a program carried out under the Job Training Partnership 
Act of 1982, except that in respect to earned income such disregard may 
not exceed six months per calendar year.
    (vii) At State option, disregard all or part of the monthly earned 
income of any dependent child applying for AFDC, if the child is a full-
time student, and that income has been disregarded for purposes of 
paragraph (a)(3)(xiii) of this section.
    (viii) Disregard as income the amount of any earned income tax 
credit payments received by an applicant or recipient. Disregard as 
resources, in the month of receipt and the following month, the amount 
of any earned income tax credit payments received by an applicant or 
recipient. ``Earned income tax credit payments'' include: Any advance 
earned income tax credit payment made to a family by an employer and any 
earned income tax credit payment made as a refund of Federal income 
taxes.
    (12) Recoupment of overpayments and correction of underpayments for 
programs other than AFDC. Specify uniform Statewide policies for:
    (i) Recoupment of overpayments of assistance, including certain 
overpayments resulting from assistance paid pending hearing decisions.
    (A) The State may not recoup any overpayment previously made to a 
recipient:

[[Page 99]]

    (1) Unless the recipient has income or resources exclusive of the 
current assistance payment currently available in the amount by which 
the agency proposes to reduce payments: except that,
    (2) Where such overpayments were occassioned or caused by the 
recipient's willful withholding of information concerning his income, 
resources or other circumstances which may affect the amount of payment, 
the State may recoup prior overpayments from current assistance grants 
irrespective of current income or resources.
    (B) Withholding of information which is subject to the provisions of 
paragraph (a)(12)(i)(A)(2) of this section includes the following:
    (1) Willful misstatements (either oral or written) made by a 
recipient in response to oral or written questions from the State agency 
concerning the recipient's income, resources or other circumstances 
which may affect the amount of payment. Such misstatements may include 
understatements of amounts of income or resources and omission of an 
entire category of income or resources;
    (2) A willful failure by the recipient to report changes in income, 
resources or other circumstances which may affect the amount of payment, 
if the State agency has clearly notified the recipient of an obligation 
to report such changes. The recipient shall be given such notification 
periodically at times (not less frequently than semi-annually) and by 
methods which the State agency determines will effectively bring such 
reporting requirements to the recipient's attention:
    (3) A willfull failure by the recipient (i) to report receipt of a 
payment which the recipient knew represented an erroneous overpayment, 
or (ii) to notify the State agency of receipt of a check which exceeded 
the prior check by at least the amount which the State agency had 
previously notified the recipient (pursuant to the provisions of 
paragraph (a)(12)(i)(A)(4) of this section) might represent an 
overpayment and constitute a sum to which the recipient would not be 
entitled. In making a determination pursuant to this paragraph 
(a)(12)(i)(B)(3), all relevant circumstances including the amount by 
which the erroneous payment exceeded the previous payment shall be 
considered.
    (C) Each periodic notification under paragraph (a)(12)(i)(B)(2) of 
this section shall:
    (1) Include a reminder that it is the recipient's continuing 
obligation to furnish to the State agency accurate and timely 
information concerning changes in income, resources, or other 
circumstances which may affect the amount of payment, within a 
reasonable specified period after such change. The recipient may also be 
notified that a failure to so notify the State agency within the 
designated time period may constitute a willful withholding of such 
information and permit the State agency to recover any overpayment 
occasioned or caused by the willful withholding;
    (2) Specifically and comprehensibly in simple phraseology indicate 
the type of information to be disclosed by the recipient. Examples shall 
be furnished of the most frequent types of newly acquired income or 
resources (e.g., inheritance, wages from a part-time job);
    (3) Require that, if there is any doubt whether a particular change 
in circumstances constitutes such reportable information, the recipient 
contact the State agency or a designated representative thereof within a 
reasonable specified period of time after such change in circumstances;
    (4) If the State plan provides for recoupment in the circumstances 
described in paragraph (a)(12)(i)(B)(3)(ii) of this section, notify the 
recipient that if the check received exceeds the prior check by a 
specified amount (which amount may not be less than that which a 
reasonable man should have known was erroneous), this increased check 
may constitute a sum to which the recipient is not entitled. In such 
instances, the notification may require that the recipient notify the 
State agency or a designated representative thereof prior to the 
negotiation of such check, so that corrective action may be taken; the 
State agency shall respond to such notification within 24 hours. The 
recipient may also be notified that a failure to so notify the State 
agency within the designated time period may constitute a willful

withholding of such information and permit the State agency to recover 
such overpayment.
    (D) The State agency shall require periodic formal acknowledgement 
by recipients (on a form utilized for this purpose) that the reporting 
obligations of this paragraph had been brought to the recipient's 
attention and that they were understood.
    (E) Any recoupment of overpayments made under circumstances other 
than those specified in paragraph (a)(12)(i)(B) of this section shall be 
limited to overpayments made during the 12 months preceding the month in 
which the overpayment was discovered.
    (F) Any recoupment of overpayments permitted by paragraph 
(a)(12)(i)(A)(2) of this section may be made from available income and 
resources (including disregarded, set-aside or reserved items) or from 
current assistance payment or from both. If recoupments are made from 
current assistance payments, the State shall, on a case-by-case basis, 
limit the proportion of such payments that may be deducted in each case, 
so as not to cause undue hardship to recipients.
    (G) The plan may provide for recoupment in all situations specified 
herein, or only in certain of the circumstances specified herein, and 
for waiver of the overpayment where the cost of collection would exceed 
the amount of the overpayment.
    (H) Election by the State not to recoup overpayments shall not waive 
the provisions of Secs. 205.40, and 205.41, or any other quality control 
requirement.
    (ii) Prompt correction of underpayments to current recipients, 
resulting from administrative error where the State plan provides for 
recoupment of overpayments. Under this requirement:
    (a) Retroactive corrective payment shall be made only for the 12 
months preceding the month in which the underpayment is discovered;
    (b) For purposes of determining continued eligibility and amount of 
assistance, such retroactive corrective payments shall not be considered 
as income or as a resource in the month paid nor in the next following 
month; and
    (c) No retroactive payment need be made where the administrative 
cost would exceed the amount of the payment.
    (13) Recovery of overpayments and correction of underpayments for 
AFDC.(i) Specify uniform Statewide policies for recovery of overpayments 
of assistance, including overpayments resulting from assistance paid 
pending hearing decisions. Overpayment means a financial assistance 
payment received by or for an assistance unit for the payment month 
which exceeds the amount for which that unit was eligible. (The agency 
may deny assistance for the corresponding payment month rather than 
recover if the assistance unit was ineligible for the budget month, the 
State becomes aware of the ineligibility when the monthly report is 
submitted, the recipient accurately reported the budget month's income 
and other circumstances, and the assistance unit will be eligible for 
the following payment month.)
    (A) The State must take all reasonable steps necessary to promptly 
correct any overpayment, except that, as set forth in the plan, a State 
may waive any overpayment which occurred because receipt of an earned 
income tax credit payment by a family during the period January 1, 1990, 
to December 31, 1990, caused ineligibility under the 185 percent gross 
income limitation in paragraph (a)(3)(xiii) of this section.
    (1) Any recovery of an overpayment to a current assistance unit, 
including a current assistance unit or recipient whose overpayment 
occurred during a prior period of eligibility, must be recovered through 
repayment (in part or in full) by the individual responsible for the 
overpayment or recovering the overpayment by reducing the amount of any 
aid payable to the assistance unit of which he or she is a member, or 
both.
    (2) If recovery is made from the grant, such recovery shall result 
in the assistance unit retaining, for any payment month, from the 
combined aid, income and liquid resources, (without application of 
section 402(a)(8) of the Act) not less than 90 percent of the amount 
payable under the State plan to a family of the same composition with no 
other income. Where a State chooses to recover at a rate less than

[[Page 101]]

the maximum, it must recover promptly.

    (B) The State shall recover an overpayment from (1) the assistance 
unit which was overpaid, or (2) any assistance unit of which a member of 
the overpaid assistance unit has subsequently become a member, or (3) 
any individual members of the overpaid assistance unit whether or not 
currently a recipient. If the State recovers from individuals who are no 
longer recipients, or from recipients who refuse to repay the 
overpayment from their income and resources, recovery shall be made by 
appropriate action under State law against the income or resources of 
those individuals.
    (C) If through recovery, the amount payable to the assistance unit 
is reduced to zero, members of the assistance unit are still considered 
recipients of AFDC.
    (D) In cases which have both an underpayment and an overpayment, the 
State may offset one against the other in correcting the payment.
    (E) Prompt recovery of an overpayment: A State must take one of the 
following three actions by the end of the quarter following the quarter 
in which the overpayment is first identified:
    (1) Recover the overpayment, (2) initiate action to locate and/or 
recover the overpayment from a former recipient, or (3) execute a 
monthly recovery agreement from a current recipient's grant or income/
resources.
    (ii) Specify uniform Statewide policies for prompt correction of any 
underpayments to current recipients and those who would be a current 
recipient if the error causing the underpayment had not occurred. 
Underpayment means a financial assistance payment received by or for an 
assistance unit for the payment month which is less than the amount for 
which the assistance unit was eligible, or failure by the State to issue 
a financial assistance payment for the payment month to an eligible 
assistance unit if such payment should have been issued. Under this 
requirement, for purposes of determining continued eligibility and 
amount of assistance, such retroactive corrective payments shall not be 
considered as income, or as a resource in the month paid nor in the next 
following month.
    (iii) Paragraph (a)(13) of this section is effective for incorrect 
payments which are identified subsequent to September 30, 1981.
    (iv) In locating former recipients who have outstanding overpayments 
the State should use appropriate data sources such as State unemployment 
insurance files, State Department of Revenue information from tax 
returns, State automobile registration, Bendex, and other files relating 
to current or former recipients.
    (v) The State must maintain information on the individual and total 
number and amount of overpayments identified and their disposition for 
current and former recipients.
    (vi) The State may elect not to attempt recovery of an overpayment 
from an individual no longer receiving aid where the overpayment amount 
is less than $35. Where the overpayment amount owed by an individual no 
longer receiving aid is $35 or more, the State can determine when it is 
no longer cost-effective to continue overpayment recovery efforts, 
provided it has made reasonable efforts to recover the overpayment from 
the individual. Reasonable efforts must include notification of the 
amount of and reason for the overpayment and that repayment is required. 
States must also maintain information regarding uncollected overpayments 
as provided under paragraph (a)(13)(v) of this section, to enable the 
State to recover those overpayments if the individual subsequently 
becomes a recipient. In cases involving fraud, States must make every 
effort to recover the overpayment, regardless of the amount.
    (14) For Medicaid eligibility only, beginning October 1, 1998, 
pursuant to section 402(a)(37) of the Act, an assistance unit will be 
deemed to be receiving AFDC, but only for the purposes of this 
paragraph, for a period of nine months after the last month the family 
actually received aid if the loss of AFDC eligibility was solely because 
a member of the unit was no longer eligible due to the 4 and 12 month 
time limitations to have the $30 and one-third or the $30 disregard in 
paragraph (a)(11)(ii)(B) applied to his or her

[[Page 102]]

earned income. At State option, an additional period of Medicaid 
coverage for up to six months may be provided when the assistance unit 
would be eligible during such additional period to receive AFDC if the 
$30 and one-third or the $30 disregards were applied to the assistance 
unit's earned income.
    (15) For Medicaid eligibility only, pursuant to section 406(h) of 
the Act:
    (i) Each dependent child and each relative with whom such a child is 
living (including the eligible spouse of such relative pursuant to 
section 237.50(b) of this chapter) who becomes ineligible for AFDC 
wholly or partly because of the initiation of or an increase in the 
amount of a child or spousal support collection under title IV-D will be 
deemed to be receiving AFDC, but only for purposes of this paragraph 
(a)(15), for a period of four consecutive calendar months beginning with 
the first month of AFDC ineligibility. To be eligible for extended 
Medicaid coverage pursuant to this paragraph (a)(15), each dependent 
child and relative must meet the following conditions:
    (A) The individual must have become ineligible for AFDC on or after 
August 16, 1984; and
    (B) The individual must have received AFDC in at least three of the 
six months immediately preceding the month in which the individual 
becomes ineligible for AFDC; and
    (C) The individual must have become ineligible for AFDC wholly or 
partly as a result of the initiation of or an increase in the amount of 
a child or spousal support collection under title IV-D.
    (ii)(A) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(15)(ii)(B) of this 
section, individuals who are eligible for extended Medicaid lose this 
coverage if they move to another State during the 4-month period. 
However, if they move back to and reestablish residence in the State in 
which they have extended coverage, they are eligible for any of the 
months remaining in the 4-month period in which they are residents of 
the State.
    (B) If a State has chosen in its State plan to provide Medicaid to 
non-residents, the State may continue to provide the 4-month extended 
benefits to individuals who have moved to another State.
    (iii) For purposes of paragraph (i) of this section:
    (A) The new collection or increased collection of child or spousal 
support results in the termination of AFDC eligibility when it actively 
causes or contributes to the termination. This occurs when:
    (1) the change in support collection in and of itself is sufficient 
to cause ineligibility. This rule applies even if the support collection 
must be added to other, stable income. It also applies even if other 
independent factors, alone or in combination with each other, might 
simultaneously cause ineligibility; or
    (2) The change in support contributes to ineligibility but does not 
by itself cause ineligibility. Ineligibility must result when the change 
in support is combined with other changes in income or changes in other 
circumstances and the other changes in income or circumstances cannot 
alone or in combination result in termination without the change in 
support.
    (B) In cases of increases in the amounts of both the support 
collections and earned income, eligibility under this section does not 
preclude eligibility under paragraph (a)(14) of this section or section 
1925 of the Social Security Act (which was added by section 303(a) of 
the Family Support Act of 1988 (42 U.S.C. 139r-6)). Extended periods 
result from both an increase in the amount of the support collection and 
from an increase in earned income must run concurrently.
    (b) Federal financial participation; General. (1) Federal 
participation will be available in financial assistance payments made on 
the basis that (after application of policies governing the allowable 
reserve, disregard or setting aside of income and resources), all income 
of the needy individual, together with the assistance payment, do not 
exceed the State's defined standard of assistance, and available 
resources of the needy individuals do not exceed the limits under the 
State plan.
    (2) Federal participation is available within the maximums specified 
in the Federal law, when the payments do not exceed the amount 
determined to be

[[Page 103]]

needed under the statewide standard, and are made in accordance with the 
State method for determining the amount of the payments, as specified in 
Sec. 233.31 for AFDC and in Secs. 233.24 and 233.25 for OAA, AB, APTD, 
and AABD.
    (3) Federal participation is available in financial assistance 
payments made on the basis of the need of the individual. This basis may 
include consideration of needy persons living in the same home with the 
recipient when such other persons are within the State's policy as 
essential to his well-being. Persons living in the home who are 
``essential to the well-being of the recipient,'' as specified in the 
State plan, will govern as the basis for Federal participation (see 
Guides and Recommendations). When the State includes persons living 
outside the home or persons not in need, Federal participation is not 
available for that portion of financial assistance payments attributable 
to such persons, and the State's claims must, therefore, identify the 
amounts of any such nonmatchable payments.
    (4) For all assistance programs except AFDC, Federal participation 
is available for supplemental payments in the retrospective budgeting 
system.
    (c) Federal financial participation in vendor payments for home 
repairs. With respect to expenditures made after December 31, 1967, 
expenditures to a maximum of $500 are subject to Federal financial 
participation at 50 percent for repairing the home owned by an 
individual who is receiving aid or assistance (other than Medical 
Assistance for the Aged) under a State plan for OAA, AFDC, AB, APTD, or 
AABD if:
    (1) Prior to making the expenditures the agency determined that: (i) 
The home is so defective that continued occupancy is unwarranted; (ii) 
unless repairs are made the recipient would need to move to rental 
quarters; and (iii) the rental cost of quarters for the recipient 
(including the spouse living with him in such home and any other 
individual whose needs were considered in determining the recipient's 
need) would exceed (over a period of 2 years) the repair costs needed to 
make such home habitable together with other costs attributable to 
continued occupancy of such home.
    (2) No expenditures for repair of such home were made previously 
pursuant to a determination as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section. This does not preclude more than one payment made at the time 
repairs are made pursuant to the determination, e.g., separate payments 
to the roofer, the electrician, and the plumber.
    (3) Expenditures for home repairs are authorized in writing by a 
responsible agency person, records show the eligible person in whose 
behalf the home repair expenditure was made, and there is sufficient 
evidence that the home repair was performed.

Sec. 233.21  Budgeting methods for OAA, AB, APTD, and AABD.

    (a) Requirements for State plans. A State plan for OAA, AB, APTD, 
and AABD shall specify if assistance payments shall be computed using a 
prospective budgeting system or a retrospective budgeting system. A 
State electing retrospective budgeting shall specify which options it 
selects and the State plan shall state that it shall meet the 
requirements in Secs. 233.21 through 233.29. Budgeting methods for AFDC 
are described in Secs. 233.31 through 233.37.
    (b) Definitions. The following definitions apply to Secs. 233.21 
through 233.29:

    (1) ``Prospective budgeting'' means that the agency shall compute 
the amount of assistance for a payment month based on its best estimate 
of income and circumstances which will exist in that month. This 
estimate shall be based on the agency's reasonable expectation and 
knowledge of current, past or future circumstances.
    (2) ``Retrospective budgeting'' means that the agency shall compute 
the amount of assistance for a payment

[[Page 104]]

month based on actual income or circumstances which existed in a 
previous month, the ``budget month''.
    (3) ``Budget month'' means the fiscal or calendar month from which 
the agency shall use income or circumstances of the family to compute 
the amount of assistance.
    (4) ``Payment month'' means the fiscal or calendar month for which 
an agency shall pay assistance. Payment is based upon income or 
circumstances in the budget month. In prospective budgeting, the budget 
month and the payment month are the same. In retrospective budgeting, 
the payment month follows the budget month and the payment month shall 
begin within 32 days after the end of the budget month.
    (5) ``Make an assistance payment.'' In the context of retrospective 
budgeting, to make an assistance payment means that the check shall be 
deposited in the U.S. mail, hand delivered to the recipient, or 
deposited with an intermediary organization, such as a bank.
    (6) ``Supplemental payment.'' In the context of retrospective 
budgeting, a supplemental payment is a payment which maintains a family 
during the time it takes for the monthly assistance payment to reflect a 
change in circumstances or income.

[44 FR 26082, May 4, 1979, as amended at 47 FR 5678, Feb. 5, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 233.22  Determining eligibility under prospective budgeting.

    In States which compute the amount of the assistance payment 
prospectively, the State plan shall provide that the State shall also 
determine all factors of eligibility prospectively. Thus, the State 
agency shall establish eligibility based on its best estimate of income 
and circumstances which will exist in the month for which the assistance 
payment is made.

[44 FR 26082, May 4, 1979]


<R05>
Sec. 233.23  When assistance shall be paid under retrospective budgeting.

    (a) A State which uses retrospective budgeting shall specify in its 
plan that it will make assistance payments within the following time 
limits to recipients who file a completed report on time, and to those 
who are not required to file a report. A State shall choose one of two 
time periods for making assistance payments. The State plan shall 
provide that payment must be made:
    (1) Within 25 days from the close of the budget month; or
    (2) Between 25 and 45 days from the close of the budget month.
    (b)(1) Where a State makes payments between 25 and 45 days from the 
close of the budget month, the State plan shall provide that the State 
will make supplemental payments as provided in Sec. 233.27.
    (2) If a State makes payments within 25 days from the close of the 
budget month, and also makes supplemental payments as provided in 
Sec. 233.27, the State plan shall so specify.
    (c) In States which issue two checks for each payment month, these 
time periods apply to the first check.

[44 FR 26083, May 4, 1979]


<R05>
Sec. 233.24  Retrospective budgeting; determining eligibility and computing the assistance payment in the initial one or two months.

    (a) States which make assistance payments within 25 days of the 
close of the budget month shall determine eligibility and compute the 
amount of the payment for all recipients prospectively for the initial 
month of assistance. These States may choose to determine eligibility 
and compute the payment prospectively for the second month, also.
    (b) States which make assistance payments between 25 and 45 days 
from the close of the budget month shall determine eligibility and 
compute the amount of the payment prospectively for the initial two 
months of assistance.
    (c) When a person who previously received assistance reapplies 
during the same month in which a termination became effective, 
eligibility shall be determined according to paragraph (a) or (b) of 
this section. However, the amount of the assistance payment for the 
month of the reapplication shall be computed retrospectively.

[44 FR 26083, May 4, 1979]

[[Page 105]]


<R05>
Sec. 233.25  Retrospective budgeting; computing the assistance payment after the initial one or two months.

    The State plan shall provide:
    (a) After the initial one or two payment months of assistance under 
Sec. 233.24, the amount of each subsequent month's payment shall be 
computed retrospectively, i.e., shall be based on earned and unearned 
income received in the corresponding budget month.
    (b) In these subsequent months, other factors of need which affect 
the amount of the assistance payment may also be based on circumstances 
in the corresponding budget month, or they may be based on circumstances 
in the payment month.
    (c) For the first month in which retrospective budgeting is used, a 
State shall not consider income received by the recipient before the 
date of application. When a person reapplies during the same month in 
which a termination became effective, the State may consider income 
received before the date of application.

[44 FR 26083, May 4, 1979]


<R05>
Sec. 233.26  Retrospective budgeting; determining eligibility after the initial one or two months.

    (a) Under retrospective budgeting, there are three options for 
determining eligibility. The State plan shall specify that eligibility, 
following the initial one or two months under Sec. 233.24, shall be 
determined by one of the following methods:
    (1) A State may consider all factors, including income 
retrospectively, i.e., only from the budget month. For example, if a 
change in circumstances occurs which affects eligibility, e.g., 
deprivation ceases, the change may be reported at the end of the budget 
month and assistance shall be terminated for the corresponding payment 
month. Thus, even if the agency could have terminated assistance earlier 
than the corresponding payment month, it shall not do so under 
retrospective determination of eligibility.
    (2) A State may consider all factors, including income, 
prospectively. For example, if deprivation ceases, and the family 
becomes ineligible, the agency shall immediately take steps to terminate 
assistance.
    (3) A State may use a combination of the options in paragraphs (a) 
and (b) of this section by considering factors related to earned and 
unearned income retrospectively and all other factors prospectively. For 
example, if a change in income makes the family ineligible, the agency 
shall wait until the corresponding payment month to terminate 
assistance. On the other hand, if a change of circumstances other than 
income makes the family ineligible, the agency shall immediately take 
steps to terminate assistance.

[44 FR 26083, May 4, 1979; 44 FR 29065, May 18, 1979, as amended at 47 
FR 47828, Oct. 28, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 233.27  Supplemental payments under retrospective budgeting.

    (a) General requirements. A State plan which provides for payments 
between 25 and 45 days from the close of a budget month, shall provide 
for supplemental payments to eligible recipients who request them. A 
State plan which provides for payments within 25 days may provide for 
supplemental payments:
    (1) The supplemental payment shall be paid for the month in which it 
was requested.
    (2) The recipient family is eligible for a supplemental payment if 
its income for the month is less than 80 percent of the amount the State 
would pay for a similar family with no income. However, this percentage 
of the amount the State would pay for a similar family with no income 
may be set between 80 and 100 percent, as specified in the State plan. 
The supplemental payment equals the difference between the family's 
income in the payment month and that percentage.
    (3) Supplemental payments shall be issued within 5 working days of 
request.
    (b) How income is treated. For purposes of supplemental payments, 
income includes that month's assistance payment and any income received 
or expected to be received by the recipient, but does not include work-
related expenses.
    (1) The amount used for the assistance payment shall be the monthly 
assistance payment without regard to

[[Page 106]]

any recoupments made for prior overpayments or adjustments for prior 
underpayments.
    (2) The agency may include as income cash in hand or available in 
bank accounts. It may also include as income any cash disregarded in 
determining need or the amount of the assistance payment, but not cash 
payments that are disregarded by Sec. 233.20(a)(4)(ii), paragraphs (c) 
on relocation assistance, (d) on educational grants or loans and (g) on 
payments for certain services.

[44 FR 26083, May 4, 1979, as amended at 51 FR 9205, Mar. 18, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 233.28  Monthly reporting.

    (a) State plans specifying retrospective budgeting shall require 
that recipients with earned income, other than income from self-
employment, report that income to the agency monthly. The State may 
require recipients with unearned income, no income, or income from self-
employment to report monthly. The agency shall provide a form for this 
purpose, which:
    (1) Is written in clear simple language;
    (2) Specifies the date by which the agency must receive the form and 
the consequences of a late or incomplete form, including whether the 
agency will delay or withhold payment if the form is not returned by the 
specified date;
    (3) Identifies an individual or agency unit the recipient should 
contact to receive prompt answers to questions about information 
requested on the form, and provides a telephone number for this purpose;
    (4) Includes a statement, to be signed by the recipient, that he or 
she understands that the information he or she provides may result in 
changes in assistance, including reduction or termination;
    (5) Advises the recipient if supplemental payments are available and 
the proper procedures for initiating a request; and
    (6) Advises the recipient of his or her right to a fair hearing on 
any decrease or termination of assistance or denial of a supplemental 
payment.
    (b) The agency shall specify the date by which it must receive the 
monthly report. This date shall be at least 5 days from the end of the 
budget month and shall also allow the recipient at least 5 days to 
complete the report.
    (c) The agency may consider a monthly report incomplete only if it 
is unsigned or omits information necessary to determine eligibility or 
compute the payment amount.
    (d) The agency shall provide a stamped, self-addressed envelope for 
returning the monthly report.
    (e) The agency shall make special provisions for persons who are 
illiterate or have other handicaps so that they cannot complete a 
monthly report form.

[44 FR 26083, May 4, 1979]


<R05>
Sec. 233.29  How monthly reports are treated and what notices are required.

    (a) What happens if a completed monthly report is received on time. 
When the agency receives a completed monthly report by the date 
specified in Sec. 233.28 it shall process the payment. The agency shall 
notify the recipient of any changes from the prior payment and the basis 
for its determinations. This notice must meet the requirements of 
Sec. 205.10(a)(4)(i)(B) of this chapter on adequate notice if the 
payment is being reduced or assistance is being terminated. This notice 
must be received by the recipient no later than his or her resulting 
payment or in lieu of the payment.
    (b) What happens if the completed monthly report is received before 
the extension deadline. (1) If the completed monthly report is not 
received by the date specified in Sec. 233.28, the agency shall send a 
notice to the recipient. This notice shall inform him or her that the 
monthly report is overdue or is not complete and that he or she has at 
least 10 additional days to file. It must inform the recipient that 
termination may result if that is the agency's policy, if the report is 
not filed within the extension period. This notice must reach the 
recipient at least 10 days before the expected payment. However, in 
States in which the date specified in Sec. 233.28 is within 10 days of 
the expected payment date, the notice must reach the recipient on or 
before the expected payment date.

[[Page 107]]

    (2) When the report is received within the extension period, the 
agency may delay payment to the recipient, as follows:
    (i) In a State that pays within 25 days of the budget month the 
payment may be delayed 10 days;
    (ii) In a State that pays within 25 to 45 days of the budget month, 
the payment may not be delayed beyond the 45th day.
    (c) What happens if a monthly report is not received by the end of 
the extension period. An agency may terminate assistance if it has not 
received a report or has received an incomplete report, and the 10 day 
extension period has expired. If the State decides to terminate 
assistance, it must send the recipient a notice which meets the 
requirements of Sec. 205.10(a)(4)(i)(B) on adequate notice.
    (d) How a recipient may delay an adverse action based on a monthly 
report. If a recipient's assistance is reduced or terminated based on 
information in the monthly report, and he or she requests a fair hearing 
within 10 days, the assistance payment shall be reinstated immediately 
at the previous month's level pending the hearing decision. The payment 
shall be made effective from the date assistance was reduced or 
terminated.

<R05>
Sec. 233.31  Budgeting methods for AFDC.

    (a) Requirements for State plans. A State plan for AFDC shall 
specify that all factors of eligibility shall be determined 
prospectively and the amount of the assistance for any month for all 
assistance units required to file a monthly report for the month 
designated as the budget month under the State's retrospective budgeting 
procedures shall be determined using retrospective budgeting as provided 
in Secs. 233.31-233.37 except as provided in Sec. 233.34. The State plan 
shall specify whether the State uses prospective or retrospective 
budgeting to determine the amount of the assistance payments for 
recipients not required to report monthly. Budgeting methods for OAA, 
AB, APTD, and AABD are described in Secs. 233.21-233.29.
    (b) Definitions. The following definitions apply to Secs. 233.31 
through 233.37:
    (1) ``Prospective budgeting'' means that the agency shall determine 
eligibility (and compute the amount of assistance for the first one or 
two months) based on its best estimate of income and circumstances which 
will exist in that month. This estimate shall be based on the agency's 
reasonable expectation and knowledge of current, past or future 
circumstances.
    (2) ``Retrospective budgeting'' means that the agency shall compute 
the amount of assistance for a payment month based on actual income or 
circumstances which existed in a previous month, the ``budget month.''
    (3) ``Budget month'' means the fiscal or calendar month from which 
the agency shall use income or circumstances of the family to compute 
the amount of assistance.
    (4) ``Payment month'' means the fiscal or calendar month for which 
an agency shall pay assistance. Payment is based upon income or 
circumstances in the budget month. In prospective budgeting, the budget 
month and the payment month are the same. In retrospective budgeting, 
the payment month follows the budget month.
    (5) ``Recent work history'' means the individual received earned 
income in any one of the two months prior to the budget month.

FR 30160, July 8, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 233.32  Payment and budget months (AFDC).

    A State shall specify in its plan for AFDC the time period covered 
by the payment (payment month) and the time period used to determine 
that payment (budget month) and whether it adopts (a) a one-month or 
two-month retrospective system; and (b) a one-month or two-month 
prospective system for the initial payment months. If a State elects to 
have a two-month retrospective system it must also elect a two-month 
prospective system.

[47 FR 5678, Feb. 5, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 233.33  Determining eligibility prospectively for all payment months (AFDC).

    (a) The State plan for AFDC shall provide that the State shall 
determine all factors of eligibility prospectively for all payment 
months. Thus, the State agency shall establish eligibility

[[Page 108]]

based on its best estimate of income and circumstances which will exist 
in the month for which the assistance payment is made.
    (b) When a IV-A agency receives an official report of a child 
support collection it shall consider that information as provided in 
Sec. 232.20(a) of this chapter. (Sec. 232.20(a) explains the treatment 
of child support collections.)

[47 FR 5678, Feb. 5, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 233.34  Computing the assistance payment in the initial one or two months (AFDC).

    A State shall compute the amount of the AFDC payment for the initial 
month of eligibility:
    (a) Prospectively (except as in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this 
section); or
    (b) Retrospectively if the applicant received assistance (or would 
have except for the prohibition on payments of less than $10) for the 
immediately preceding payment month (except where the State pays the 
second month after application prospectively); or
    (c) Retrospectively if:
    (1) Assistance had been suspended as defined in paragraph (d) of 
this section; and
    (2) The initial month follows the month of suspension; and
    (3) The family's circumstances for the initial month had not changed 
significantly from those reported in the corresponding budget month, 
e.g., loss of job.
    (d) A State may suspend, rather than terminate, assistance when:
    (1) The agency has knowledge of, or reason to believe that 
ineligibility would be only for one payment month; and
    (2) Ineligibility for that one payment month was caused by income or 
other circumstances in the corresponding budget month.
    (e) If the initial month is computed prospectively as in paragraph 
(a) of this section, the second month shall be prospective if the State 
elects a 2-month retrospective budgeting system.

[47 FR 5679, Feb. 5, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 233.35  Computing the assistance payment under retrospective budgeting after the initial one or two months (AFDC).

    The State plan for AFDC shall provide:
    (a) After the initial one or two payment months of assistance under 
Sec. 233.34, the amount of each subsequent month's payment shall be 
computed retrospectively, i.e., shall be based on income and other 
relevant circumstances in the corresponding budget month except as 
provided in Sec. 233.20(a)(3)(iii). In any month for which an individual 
will be determined eligible prospectively and will be added to an 
existing AFDC assistance unit, the State must meet the individual's 
needs to the same extent it would if the individual were an applicant 
for AFDC.
    (b) Except as provided in Sec. 233.34(b), for the first and second 
payment month for which retrospective budgeting is used, the State shall 
not count income from the budget month already considered for any 
payment month determined prospectively which is not of a continuous 
nature.

[47 FR 5679, Feb. 5, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 233.36  Monthly reporting (AFDC).

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a State 
plan for AFDC shall require the caretaker relative, or another person 
designated by the State, to submit, on behalf of each assistance unit 
whose members have earned income or recent work history, each assistance 
unit which has income deemed to it from individuals living with the unit 
who have earned income or a recent work history and, at State option, 
other assistance units, a completed report form to the agency monthly 
on:
    (1) Budget month income, family composition, and other circumstances 
relevant to the amount of the assistance payment; and
    (2) Any changes in income, resources, or other relevant 
circumstances affecting continued eligibility which the assistance unit 
expects to occur in the current month or in future months.

[[Page 109]]

    (3) The income of a parent or a legal guardian of a minor parent, a 
stepparent, or an alien sponsor, as well as the resources of an alien 
sponsor, where appropriate.
    (b) A State may exempt categories of recipients otherwise required 
to report monthly from reporting each month with prior approval by the 
Secretary if the State can demonstrate that not requiring these cases to 
file monthly reports is cost effective. The Secretary will grant waivers 
under this provision for a period up to one year, at the end of which 
time the State may request an extension of the waiver. A decision by the 
Secretary not to approve a request for an exemption is not appealable. 
The plan shall include criteria for assuring (1) that exempted cases are 
unlikely to incur changes in circumstances from month to month which 
would impact their eligibility or amount of assistance and (2) that the 
administrative cost of requiring those categories to report monthly will 
be greater than the program savings which would accrue.
    (c) States shall also direct recipients to report information as 
defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section to the agency as they become 
aware of expected changes rather than waiting to inform the State on the 
monthly report.

[47 FR 5679, Feb. 5, 1982 as amended at 49 FR 35602, Sept. 10, 1984; 57 
FR 30160, July 8, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 233.37  How monthly reports are treated and what notices are required (AFDC).

    (a) What happens if a completed monthly report is received on time. 
When the agency receives a completed monthly report as specified in 
Sec. 233.36, and if all eligibility conditions are met, it shall process 
the payment. The agency shall notify the recipient of any changes from 
the prior payment and the basis for its determinations. This notice must 
meet the requirements of Sec. 205.10(a)(4)(i)(B) of this chapter on 
adequate notice if the payment is being reduced or assistance is 
terminated as a result of information provided in the monthly report. 
The notice must be mailed to arrive no later than the resulting payment 
or in lieu of the payment. A recipient has 10 days from the date of the 
notice to request a hearing in order to receive reinstatement.
    (b) What happens if a completed monthly report is not received by 
the agency. An agency may terminate assistance if it has received no 
report or has received only an incomplete report as defined by the 
State. In this case, the agency must send the recipient a notice meeting 
the requirements of Sec. 205.10(a)(4)(i)(B) to arrive not later than the 
date it would have made payment if the agency had received a completed 
monthly report on time. If the recipient notifies the agency and files a 
completed report within 10 days of the date of this notice, the agency 
must accept the replacement form and make a payment based on the 
information on the form if the information indicates that the person is 
still eligible (without the applicable earned income disregards if the 
State agency determines no good cause exists for failing to file a 
timely report of earnings). If the recipient is found ineligible or 
eligible for an amount less than the prior month's payment, the State 
must promptly notify the recipient of his or her right to a fair hearing 
and his or her right to have assistance reinstated. A recipient has 10 
days from the date of the notice to request a hearing in order to 
receive reinstatement.
    (c) What happens if a completed monthly report is received but is 
not timely. States must specify in their plans a definition of 
timeliness related to the filing of a monthly report and the number of 
days an individual has to report changes in earnings which impact 
eligibility. States must inform recipients what constitutes timeliness 
and that no disregard of earnings as described in Sec. 233.20(a)(11) (i) 
and (ii)(B) ($30 and one-third, child care, and work expenses) will be 
applied to any earnings which are not reported in a timely manner 
without good cause. The State must provide recipients an opportunity to 
show good cause for not filing a timely report of earnings. If the State 
finds good cause, then applicable earned income disregards will be 
applied in determining payment. If the State does not find good cause, 
then applicable earned income disregards will not be applied. If the 
recipient is found ineligible or eligible for an amount less

[[Page 110]]

than the prior month's payment, the State must promptly notify the 
recipient of his or her right to a fair hearing and his or her right to 
have assistance reinstated. A recipient has 10 days from the date of the 
notice to request a hearing in order to receive reinstatement.

[47 FR 5679, Feb. 5, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 233.38  Waiver of monthly reporting and retrospective budgeting requirements; AFDC.

    (a) States may request waivers of the requirements at Secs. 233.31-
233.37 to promote compatibility with monthly reporting and budgeting 
requirements of the Food Stamp Act of 1977 as amended.
    (b) The Secretary will not approve requests for waivers unless the 
information documenting the need for the waiver shows that the waiver 
would simplify administration of both programs and would not result in a 
net cost to the Federal government. Approvals for waivers will be for 
periods up to one year, after which time the State may request an 
extension of the waiver.
    (c) Any decision by the Secretary not to approve a request for a 
waiver is not appealable.

[49 FR 35602, Sept. 10, 1984]


<R05>
Sec. 233.39  Age.

    (a) Condition for plan approval. A State plan under title I or XVI 
of the Social Security Act may not impose any age requirement of more 
than 65 years.
    (b) Federal financial participation. (1) Federal financial 
participation is available in financial assistance provided to otherwise 
eligible persons who were, for any portion of the month for which 
assistance is paid:
    (i) In OAA or AABD with respect to the aged, 65 years of age or 
over;
    (ii) In AFDC, under 18 years of age; or age 18 if a full-time 
student in a secondary school, or in the equivalent level of vocational 
or technical training, and reasonably expected to complete the program 
before reaching age 19.
    (iii) In AB or AABD with respect to the blind, any age;
    (iv) In APTD or AABD with respect to the disabled, 18 years of age 
or older.
    (2) Federal determination of whether an individual meets the age 
requirements of the Social Security Act will be made according to the 
common-law method (under which a specific age is attained the day before 
the anniversary of birth), unless the State plan specifies that the 
popular usage method (under which an age is attained on the anniversary 
of birth), is used.
    (3) The State agency may adopt an arbitrary date such as July 1 as 
the point from which age will be computed in all instances where the 
month of an individual's birth is not available, but the year can be 
established.

<R05>
Sec. 233.40  Residence.

    (a) Condition for plan approval. A State plan under title I, IV-A, 
X, XIV, or XVI of the Social Security Act may not impose any residence 
requirement which excludes any individual who is a resident of the State 
except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. For purposes of 
this section:
    (1) A resident of a State is one: (i) Who is living in the State 
voluntarily with the intention of making his or her home there and not 
for a temporary purpose. A child is a resident of the State in which he 
or she is living other than on a temporary basis. Residence may not 
depend upon the reason for which the individual entered the State, 
except insofar as it may bear upon whether the individual is there 
voluntarily or for a temporary purpose; or
    (ii) Who, is living in the State, is not receiving assistance from 
another State, and entered the State with a job commitment or seeking 
employment in the State (whether or not currently employed). Under this 
definition, the child is a resident of the State in which the caretaker 
is a resident.
    (2) Residence is retained until abandoned. Temporary absence from 
the State, with subsequent returns to the State, or intent to return 
when the purposes of the absence have been accomplished, does not 
interrupt continuity of residence.
    (b) Exception. A State plan under title I, X, XIV, or XVI need not 
include an

[[Page 111]]

individual who has been absent from the State for a period in excess of 
90 consecutive days (regardless of whether the individual has maintained 
his or her residence in the State during this period) until he or she 
has been present in the State for a period of 30 consecutive days (or a 
shorter period specified by the State) in the case of such individual 
who has maintained residence in the State during such period of absence 
or for a period of 90 consecutive days (or a shorter period as specified 
by the State) in the case of any other such individual. An individual 
thus excluded under any such plan may not, as a consequence of that 
exclusion, be excluded from assistance under the State's title XIX plan 
if otherwise eligible under the title XIX plan (see 42 CFR 436.403).

Sec. 233.50  Citizenship and alienage.

    A State plan under title I (OAA); title IV-A (AFDC); title X (AB); 
title XIV (APTD); and title XVI (AABD-disabled) of the Social Security 
Act shall provide that an otherwise eligible individual, dependent 
child, or a caretaker relative or any other person whose needs are 
considered in determining the need of the child or relative claiming 
aid, must be either:
    (a) A citizen, or
    (b) An alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence or otherwise 
permanently residing in the United States under color of law, including 
certain aliens lawfully present in the United States as a result of the 
application of the following provisions of the Immigration and 
Nationality Act:
    (1) Section 207(c), in effect after March 31, 1980--Aliens Admitted 
as Refugees.
    (2) Section 203(a)(7), in effect prior to April 1, 1980--Individuals 
who were Granted Status as Conditional Entrant Refugees.
    (3) Section 208--Aliens Granted Political Asylum by the Attorney 
General.
    (4) Section 212(d)(5)--Aliens Granted Temporary Parole Status by the 
Attorney General, or
    (c) An alien granted lawful temporary resident status pursuant to 
section 201, 302, or 303 of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 
1986 (Pub. L. 99-603) who must be either:
    (1) A Cuban and Haitian entrant as defined in paragraph (1) or 
(2)(A) of section 501(e) of Pub. L. 96-422, as in effect on April 1, 
1983, or
    (2) An adult assistance applicant for OAA, AB, APTD, or AABD, or
    (3) An applicant for AFDC who is not a Cuban and Haitian applicant 
under paragraph (c)(1) of this section who was adjusted to lawful 
temporary resident status more than five years prior to application.

All other aliens granted lawful temporary or permanent resident status, 
pursuant to sections 201, 302, or 303 of the Immigration Reform and 
Control Act of 1986, are disqualified for five years from the date 
lawful temporary resident status is granted.

Sec. 233.51  Eligibility of sponsored aliens.

    Definition: Sponsor is any person who, or any public or private 
agency or organization that, executed an affidavit(s) of support or 
similar agreement on behalf of an alien (who is not the child of the 
sponsor or the sponsor's spouse) as a condition of the alien's entry 
into the United States. Paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section apply 
only to aliens who are sponsored by individuals and who filed 
applications for the first time after September 30, 1981. Paragraphs (e) 
and (f) apply only to aliens sponsored by public or private agencies or 
organizations with respect to periods after October 1, 1984. A State 
plan under title IV-A of the Act shall provide that:
    (a) For a period of three years following entry for permanent 
residence into the United States, a sponsored alien who is not exempt 
under paragraph (g) of this section, shall provide the State agency with 
any information and documentation necessary to determine the income and 
resources of the sponsor and the sponsor's spouse (if applicable and if 
living with the sponsor) that can be deemed available to the alien, and 
obtain any cooperation necessary from the sponsor.
    (b) The income and resources of a sponsor and the sponsor's spouse 
shall be deemed to be the unearned income

[[Page 112]]

and resources of an alien for three years following the alien's entry 
into the United States:
    (1) Monthly income deemed available to the alien from the sponsor 
and the sponsor's spouse not receiving AFDC or SSI shall be:
    (i) The total monthly unearned and earned income of the sponsor and 
sponsor's spouse reduced by 20 percent (not to exceed $175) of the total 
of any amounts received by them in the month as wages or salary or as 
net earnings from self-employment.
    (ii) The amount described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section 
reduced by:
    (A) The cash needs standard under the plan in the alien's State of 
residence for a family of the same size and composition as the sponsor 
and those other people living in the same household as the sponsor who 
are or could be claimed by the sponsor as dependents to determine his or 
her Federal personal income tax liability but whose needs are not taken 
into account in making a determination under Sec. 233.20 of this 
chapter;
    (B) Any amounts actually paid by the sponsor or sponsor's spouse to 
people not living in the household who are or could be claimed by them 
as dependents to determine their Federal personal income tax liability; 
and
    (C) Actual payments of alimony or child support, with respect to 
individuals not living in the household.
    (2) Monthly resources deemed available to the alien from the sponsor 
and sponsor's spouse shall be the total amount of their resources 
determined as if they were applying for AFDC in the alien's State of 
residence, less $1500.
    (c) In any case where a person is the sponsor of two or more aliens, 
the income and resources of the sponsor and sponsor's spouse, to the 
extent they would be deemed the income and resources of any one of the 
aliens under the provisions of this section, shall be divided equally 
among the sponsored aliens.
    (d) Income and resources which are deemed to a sponsored alien shall 
not be considered in determining the need of other unsponsored members 
of the alien's family except to the extent the income or resources are 
actually available.
    (e) For a period of three years following entry for permanent 
residence into the United States, any alien who is not exempt under 
paragraph (g) of this section and has been sponsored by a public or 
private agency or organization, shall be ineligible for assistance 
unless the State agency determines (in accordance with paragraph (f)) 
that the sponsor no longer exists or has become unable to meet the 
alien's needs.
    (f) The State plan shall set forth the criteria the State agency 
will use in determining whether an agency or organization no longer 
exists or is unable to meet the alien's needs and the documentation the 
agency will require of the alien in making such determination. The 
sponsored alien shall provide the State agency with any information and 
documentation necessary for such determination and obtain any 
cooperation necessary from the sponsor.
    (g) The provisions of this section shall not apply to any alien who 
is:
    (1) Admitted as a conditional entrant refugee to the United States 
as a result of the application, of the provisions of section 203(a)(7) 
(in effect prior to April 1, 1980) of the Immigration and Nationality 
Act;
    (2) Admitted as a refugee to the United States as a result of the 
application of the provisions of section 207(c) (in effect after March 
31, 1980) of the Immigration and Nationality Act;
    (3) Paroled into the United States as a refugee under section 
212(d)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act;
    (4) Granted political asylum by the Attorney General under section 
208 of the Immigration and Nationality Act;
    (5) A Cuban or Haitian entrant, as defined in section 501(e) of the 
Refugee Education Assistance Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-422); or
    (6) The dependent child of the sponsor or sponsor's spouse.

    (h) The Secretary shall make information necessary to make a 
determination under this section and supplied under agreement with the 
Secretary of State and the Attorney General, available upon request to a 
concerned State Agency.

Sec. 233.52  Overpayment to aliens.

    A State Plan under title IV-A of the Social Security Act, shall 
provide that:
    (a) Any sponsor of an alien and the alien shall be jointly and 
severally liable for any overpayment of aid under the State plan made to 
the alien during the three years after the alien's entry into the United 
States due to the sponsor's failure to provide correct information under 
the provisions of Sec. 233.51, except as provided in paragraph (b) of 
this section.
    (b) When a sponsor is found to have good cause or to be without 
fault (as defined in the State plan) for not providing information to 
the agency, the sponsor will not be held liable for the overpayment and 
recovery will not be made from this sponsor.
    (c) An overpayment for which the alien or the sponsor and the alien 
are liable (as described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section) 
shall be repaid to the State or recovered in accordance with 
Sec. 233.20(a)(13). If the agency is unable to recover the overpayment 
through this method, funds to reimburse the agency for the overpayment 
shall be withheld from future payments to which the alien or the alien 
and the individual sponsor are entitled under:
    (1) Any State administered or supervised program established by the 
Social Security Act, or
    (2) Any federally administered cash benefit program established by 
the Social Security Act.

Sec. 233.53  Support and maintenance assistance (including home energy assistance) in AFDC.

    (a) General. At State option, certain support and maintenance 
assistance (including home energy assistance) may be excluded from 
income and resources.
    (b) Definitions. The following definitions are limited to the 
support and maintenance assistance provisions of this section.
    ``Appropriate State agency'' means the agency designated by the 
chief executive officer of the State to handle the State's 
responsibilities with respect to support and maintenance assistance 
under paragraph (c) of this section.
    ``Based on need'' means that the assistance is given to or on behalf 
of an applicant or recipient for the purpose of support and maintenance 
(including home energy) and meets the criteria established by the State 
for determining the need for such assistance.
    ``In kind assistance'' means assistance furnished in any form except 
direct cash payments to an applicant or recipient or direct payments to 
an applicant or recipient through other financial instruments which are 
convertible to cash.
    ``Private, nonprofit organization'' means a religious, charitable, 
educational, or other organization such as described in section 501(c) 
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. (Actual tax exempt certification 
by IRS is not necessary).
    ``Rate-of-return entity'' means an entity whose revenues are 
primarily received from the entity's charges to the public for goods or 
services, and such charges are based on rates regulated by a State or 
Federal governmental body.
    ``Support and maintenance assistance'' means any assistance designed 
to meet the expenses of day to day living. Support and maintenance 
assistance includes home energy assistance. Home energy assistance means 
any assistance related to meeting the cost of heating or cooling a home. 
Home energy assistance includes such items as payments for utility 
service or bulk fuels; assistance in kind such as portable heaters, 
fans, blankets, storm doors, or other items which help reduce the costs 
of heating and cooling such as conservation or weatherization materials 
and services; etc.
    (c) Requirements for State Plans. If a State elects to exclude from 
income and resources support and maintenance

[[Page 114]]

assistance, the State plan for AFDC must as specified below:
    (1) Provide that an appropriate State agency will certify that 
support and maintenance assistance is based on need (as defined in 
paragraph (b) of this section), and that such certification will be 
accepted for purposes of determining eligibility for and the amount of 
payments under the AFDC program.
    (2) Provide that in joint AFDC/SSI households, support and 
maintenance assistance furnished to the household which is not excluded 
under this paragraph will be prorated on a reasonable basis to determine 
the amount provided to the AFDC assistance unit. The State plan must 
describe the method that will be used to prorate the assistance in these 
circumstances.
    (3) Provide that the types and amount of support and maintenance 
assistance that are excluded when received by an AFDC applicant or 
recipient will also be excluded in determining the income and resources 
of a parent, stepparent, spouse or alien sponsor whose income is 
considered available to an AFDC applicant or recipient.
    (4) Provide that the State may exclude, from income and resources, 
support and maintenance assistance (as defined in paragraph (b) of this 
section) which the appropriate State agency certifies is based on need, 
if the assistance is furnished by:
    (i) A supplier of home heating gas or oil, regardless of whether the 
assistance is in cash or in kind; or
    (ii) A municipal utility providing home energy, regardless of 
whether the assistance is in cash or in kind; or
    (iii) A rate-of-return entity which provides home energy, regardless 
of whether the assistance is in cash or in kind; or
    (iv) A private nonprofit organization, but only if such assistance 
is in kind.
    (5) Provide that, if the State elects to exclude from income and 
resources any support and maintenance assistance, the State plan must:
    (i) Describe the criteria that will be used to determine the need 
for the assistance;
    (ii) Identify the types and amounts of assistance which will be 
excluded; and
    (iii) Provide that any limitations will be made on a reasonable 
basis.

Sec. 233.70  Blindness.

    (a) State plan requirements. A State plan under title X or XVI of 
the Social Security Act must:
    (1) Contain a definition of blindness in terms of ophthalmic 
measurement. The following definition is recommended: An individual is 
considered blind if he has central visual acuity of 20/200 or less in 
the better eye with correcting glasses or a field defect in which the 
peripheral field has contracted to such an extent that the widest 
diameter of visual field subtends an angular distance of no greater than 
20 deg..
    (2) Provide, in any instance in which a determination is to be made 
whether an individual is blind or continues to be blind as defined under 
the State plan, that there will be an initial examination or re-
examination performed by either a physician skilled in the diseases of 
the eye or by an optometrist, whichever the individual so selects.
    (i) No examination is necessary when both eyes are missing.
    (ii) Where an initial eye examination or re-examination is 
necessary, the physician or optometrist conducting such examination will 
submit to the State agency a report thereof, on such forms and in such 
manner, as may be prescribed for such purpose. A determination whether 
the individual meets the State's definition of blindness under the State 
plan will be based upon a review of such eye examination report as 
provided for in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, and other information 
or additional examination reports as the State deems necessary.
    (3) Provide that each initial eye examination report and any 
subsequent re-examination report will be reviewed

[[Page 116]]

by a State reviewing physician skilled in the diseases of the eye (e.g., 
an ophthalmologist or an eye, ear, nose and throat specialist). Such 
physician is responsible for making the agency's decision that the 
applicant or recipient does or does not meet the State's definition of 
blindness, and for determining if and when reexaminations are necessary 
in periodic reviews of eligibility, as required in 
Sec. 206.10(a)(9)(iii) of this chapter.
    (b) Federal financial participation--(1) Assistance payments. 
Federal financial participation is available in assistance provided to 
or in behalf of any otherwise eligible person who is blind under the 
State's title X or XVI plan. Blindness may be considered as continuing 
until a determination by the reviewing physician establishes the fact 
that the recipient's vision has improved beyond the State's definition 
of blindness set forth under its State title of X or XVI plan.
    (2) Administrative expenses. Federal financial participation is 
available in any expenditures incident to the eye examination necessary 
to determine whether an individual is blind.

<R05>
Sec. 233.80  Disability.

    (a) State plan requirements. A State plan under title XIV or XVI of 
the Social Security Act must:
    (1) Contain a definition of permanently and totally disabled, 
showing that:
    (i) ``Permanently'' is related to the duration of the impairment or 
combination of impairments; and
    (ii) ``Totally'' is related to the degree of disability.

The following definition is recommended:
    ``Permanently and totally disabled'' means that the individual has 
some permanent physical or mental impairment, disease, or loss, or 
combination thereof, this substantially precludes him from engaging in 
useful occupations within his competence, such as holding a job.

Under this definition:
    ``Permanently'' refers to a condition which is not likely to improve 
or which will continue throughout the lifetime of the individual; it may 
be a condition which is not likely to respond to any known therapeutic 
procedures, or a condition which is likely to remain static or to become 
worse unless certain therapeutic measures are carried out, where 
treatment is unavailable, inadvisable, or is refused by the individual 
on a reasonable basis; ``permanently'' does not rule out the possibility 
of vocational rehabilitation or even possible recovery in light of 
future medical advances or changed prognosis; in this sense the term 
refers to a condition which continues indefinitely, as distinct from one 
which is temporary or transient;
    ``Totally'' involves considerations in addition to those verified 
through the medical findings, such as age, training, skills, and work 
experience, and the probable functioning of the individual in his 
particular situation in light of his impairment; an individual's 
disability would usually be tested in relation to ability to engage in 
remunerative employment; the ability to keep house or to care for others 
would be the appropriate test for (and only for) individuals, such as 
housewives, who were engaged in this occupation prior to the disability 
and do not have a history of gainful employment; eligibility may 
continue, even after a period of rehabilitation and readjustment, if the 
individual's work capacity is still very considerably limited (in 
comparison with that of a normal person) in terms of such factors as the 
speed with which he can work, the amount he can produce in a given 
period of time, and the number of hours he is able to work.

    (2) Provide for the review of each medical report and social history 
by technically competent persons--not less than a physician and a social 
worker qualified by professional training and pertinent experience--
acting cooperatively, who are responsible for the agency's decision that 
the applicant does or does not meet the State's definition of permanent 
and total disability. Under this requirement:
    (i) The medical report must include a substantiated diagnosis, based 
either on existing medical evidence or upon current medical examination;
    (ii) The social history must contain sufficient information to make 
it possible to relate the medical findings to the activities of the 
``useful occupation'' and to determine whether the individual is totally 
disabled, and
    (iii) The review physician is responsible for setting dates for 
reexamination; the review team is responsible for reviewing 
reexamination reports in conjunction with the social data to determine 
whether disabled recipients whose health condition may improve

[[Page 117]]

continue to meet the State's definition of permanent and total 
disability.
    (3) Provide for cooperative arrangements with related programs, such 
as vocational rehabilitation services.
    (b) Federal financial participation--(1) Assistance payments. 
Federal financial participation is available in payments to or in behalf 
of any otherwise eligible individual who is permanently and totally 
disabled. Permanent and total disability may be considered as continuing 
until the review team establishes the fact that the recipient's 
disability is no longer within the State's definition of permanent and 
total disability.
    (2) Administrative expenses. Federal financial participation is 
available in any expenditures incident to the medical examinations 
necessary to determine whether an individual is permanently and totally 
disabled.

<R05>
Sec. 233.90  Factors specific to AFDC.

    (a) State plan requirements. A State plan under title IV-A of the 
Social Security Act shall provide that:
    (1) The determination whether a child has been deprived of parental 
support or care by reason of the death, continued absence from the home, 
or physical or mental incapacity of a parent, or (if the State plan 
includes such cases) the unemployment of his or her parent who is the 
principal earner will be made only in relation to the child's natural or 
adoptive parent, or in relation to the child's stepparent who is 
married, under State law, to the child's natural or adoptive parent and 
is legally obligated to support the child under State law of general 
applicability which requires stepparents to support stepchildren to the 
same extent that natural or adoptive parents are required to support 
their children. Under this requirement, the inclusion in the family, or 
the presence in the home, of a ``substitute parent'' or ``man-in-the-
house'' or any individual other than one described in this paragraph is 
not an acceptable basis for a finding of ineligibility or for assuming 
the availability of income by the State; and
    (2) Where it has reason to believe that a child receiving aid is in 
an unsuitable environment because of known or suspected instances of 
physical or mental injury, sexual abuse or exploitation, or negligent 
treatment or maltreatment of such child, under circumstances which 
indicate the child's health or welfare is threatened, the State or local 
agency will:
    (i) Bring such condition to the attention of a court, law-
enforcement agency, or other appropriate agency in the State, providing 
whatever data it has with respect to the situation;
    (ii) In reporting such conditions, use the same criteria as are used 
in the State for all other parents and children; and
    (iii) Cooperate with the court or other agency in planning and 
implementing action in the best interest of the child.
    (b) Conditions for plan approval. (1) A child may not be denied AFDC 
either initially or subsequently ``because of the conditions of the home 
in which the child resides'', or because the home is considered 
``unsuitable'', unless ``provision is otherwise made pursuant to a State 
statute for adequate care and assistance with respect to such child''. 
(Section 404(b) of the Social Security Act.)
    (2) An otherwise eligible child who is under the age of 18 years may 
not be denied AFDC, regardless of whether she attends school (unless she 
is required to participate in the JOBS program pursuant to Sec. 250.30 
and she is assigned to educational activities) or makes satisfactory 
grades.
    (3) A state may elect to include in its AFDC program children age 18 
who are full-time students in a secondary school, or in the equivalent 
level of vocational or technical training, and who may reasonably be 
expected to complete the program before reaching age 19.
    (4)(i) A child may not be denied AFDC either initially or 
subsequently because a parent or other caretaker relative fails to 
cooperate with the child support agency in performing any of the 
activities needed to:
    (A) Establish the paternity of a child born out of wedlock; or
    (B) Obtain support from a person having a legal duty to support the 
child.

[[Page 118]]

    (ii) Any parent or caretaker relative who fails to so cooperate 
shall be treated in accordance with Sec. 232.12 of this chapter.
    (5) [Reserved]
    (6) An otherwise eligible child may not be denied AFDC if a parent 
is mentally or physically incapacitated as defined in paragraph 
(c)(1)(iv) of this section.
    (c) Federal financial participation. (1) Federal financial 
participation under title IV-A of the Social Security Act in payments 
with respect to a ``dependent child,'' as defined in section 406(a) of 
the Act, is available within the following interpretations:
    (i) Needy child deprived by reason of. The phrase ``needy child * * 
* deprived * * * by reason of'' requires that both need and deprivation 
of parental support or care exist in the individual case. The phrase 
encompasses the situation of any child who is in need and otherwise 
eligible, and whose parent--father or mother--either has died, has a 
physical or mental incapacity, or is continually absent from the home. 
This interpretation is equally applicable whether the parent was the 
chief bread winner or devoted himself or herself primarily to the care 
of the child, and whether or not the parents were married to each other. 
The determination whether a child has been deprived of parental support 
or care is made in relation to the child's natural parent or, as 
appropriate, the adoptive parent or stepparent described in paragraph 
(a) of this section.
    (ii) Death of a parent. If either parent of a child is deceased, the 
child is deprived of parental support or care, and may, if he is in need 
and otherwise eligible, be included within the scope of the program.
    (iii) Continued absence of the parent from the home. Continued 
absence of the parent from the home constitutes the reason for 
deprivation of parental support or care when the parent is out of the 
home, the nature of the absence is such as either to interrupt or to 
terminate the parent's functioning as a provider of maintenance, 
physical care, or guidance for the child, and the known or indefinite 
duration of the absence precludes counting on the parent's performance 
of the function of planning for the present support or care of the 
child. If these conditions exist, the parent may be absent for any 
reason, and may have left only recently or some time previously; except 
that a parent whose absence is occasioned solely by reason of the 
performance of active duty in the uniformed services of the United 
States (as defined in section 101(3) of Title 37, United States code) is 
not considered absent from the home. A parent who is a convicted 
offender but is permitted to live at home while serving a court-imposed 
sentence by performing unpaid public work or unpaid community service 
during the workday is considered absent from the home.
    (iv) ``Physical or mental incapacity''. ``Physical or mental 
incapacity'' of a parent shall be deemed to exist when one parent has a 
physical or mental defect, illness, or impairment. The incapacity shall 
be supported by competent medical testimony and must be of such a 
debilitating nature as to reduce substantially or eliminate the parent's 
ability to support or care for the otherwise eligible child and be 
expected to last for a period of at least 30 days. In making the 
determination of ability to support, the agency shall take into account 
the limited employment opportunities of handicapped individuals.

A finding of eligibility for OASDI or SSI benefits, based on disability 
or blindness is acceptable proof of incapacity for AFDC purposes.
    (v) ``Living with [a specified relative] in a place of residence 
maintained * * * as his * * * own home''. (A) A child may be considered 
to meet the requirement of living with one of the relatives specified in 
the Act if his home is with a parent or a person in one of the following 
groups:
    (1) Any blood relative, including those of half-blood, and including 
first cousins, nephews, or nieces, and persons of preceding generations 
as denoted by prefixes of grand, great, or great-great.
    (2) Stepfather, stepmother, stepbrother, and stepsister.
    (3) Person who legally adopt a child or his parent as well as the 
natural and other legally adopted children of such persons, and other 
relatives of the

[[Page 119]]

adoptive parents in accordance with State law.
    (4) Spouses of any persons named in the above groups even after the 
marriage is terminated by death or divorce.
    (B) A home is the family setting maintained or in process of being 
established, as evidenced by assumption and continuation of 
responsibility for day to day care of the child by the relative with 
whom the child is living. A home exists so long as the relative 
exercises responsibility for the care and control of the child, even 
though either the child or the relative is temporarily absent from the 
customary family setting. Within this interpretation, the child is 
considered to be ``living with'' his relative even though:
    (1) He is under the jurisdiction of the court (e.g., receiving 
probation services or protective supervision); or
    (2) Legal custody is held by an agency that does not have physical 
possession of the child.
    (2) Federal financial participation is available in:
    (i) Initial payments made on behalf of a child who goes to live with 
a relative specified in section 406(a)(1) of the Social Security Act 
within 30 days of the receipt of the first payment, provided payments 
are not made for concurrent period for the same child in the home of 
another relative or as foster care under title IV-E;
    (ii) Payments made for the entire month in the course of which a 
child leaves the home of a specified relative, provided payments are not 
made for a concurrent period for the same child in the home of another 
relative or as foster care under title IV-E; and
    (iii) Payments made to persons acting for relatives specified in 
section 406(a)(1) of the Act in emergency situations that deprive the 
child of the care of the relative through whom he has been receiving 
aid, for a temporary period necessary to make and carry out plans for 
the child's continuing care and support.
    (iv) At State option, (A) payments with respect to a pregnant woman 
with no other children receiving assistance, and additionally, at State 
option, (B) payments for the purpose of meeting special needs occasioned 
by or resulting from pregnancy both for the pregnant woman with no other 
children as well as for the pregnant woman receiving AFDC. However, for 
both paragraphs (c)(2)(iv) (A) and (B) of this section it must be 
medically verified that the child is expected to be born in the month 
such payments are made or within the three-month period following such 
month of payment, and who, if such child had been born and was living 
with her in the month of payment, would be eligible for aid to families 
with dependent children. Federal financial participation is not 
available to meet the needs of the unborn child. (Refer to Medicaid 
regulations at 42 CFR 435.115 for Medicaid coverage of pregnant women.)
    (3) Federal financial participation (at the 50 percent rate) is 
available in any expenses incurred in establishing eligibility for AFDC, 
including expenses incident to obtaining necessary information to 
determine the existence of incapacity of a parent or pregnancy of a 
mother.

Sec. 233.100  Dependent children of unemployed parents.

    (a) Requirements for State Plans. If a State wishes to provide AFDC 
for children of unemployed parents, the State plan under title IV-A of 
the Social Security Act must:
    (1) Include a definition of an unemployed parent who is the 
principal earner which shall apply only to families determined to be 
needy in accordance with the provisions in Sec. 233.20. Such definition 
must include any such parent who:
    (i) Is employed less than 100 hours a month; or
    (ii) Exceeds that standard for a particular month, if the work is 
intermittent and the excess is of a temporary nature as evidenced by the 
fact that he or she was under the 100-hour standard for the prior 2 
months and is expected to be under the standard during the next month; 
except that at the option

[[Page 120]]

of the State, such definition need not include a principal earner who is 
unemployed because of participation in a labor dispute (other than a 
strike) or by reason of conduct or circumstances which result or would 
result in disqualification for unemployment compensation under the 
State's unemployment compensation law.
    (2) Include a definition of a dependent child which shall include 
any child of an unemployed parent (as defined by the State pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section) who would be, except for the fact that 
his parent is not dead, absent from the home, or incapacitated, a 
dependent child under the State's plan approved under section 402 of the 
Act.
    (3) Provide for payment of aid with respect to any dependent child 
(as defined by the State pursuant to paragraphs (a)(2) of this section) 
when the conditions set forth in paragraphs (a)(3) (i), (ii), (iii), and 
(vii) of this section are met:
    (i) His or her parent who is the principal earner has been 
unemployed for at least 30 days prior to the receipt of such aid.
    (ii) Such parent has not without good cause, within such 30-day 
period prior to the receipt of such aid, refused a bona fide offer of 
employment or training for employment. Before it is determined that such 
parent has refused a bona fide offer of employment or training for 
employment without good cause, the agency must make a determination that 
such an offer was actually made. (In the case of offers of employment 
made through the public employment or manpower agencies, the 
determination as to whether the offer was bona fide, or whether there 
was good cause to refuse it, will be made by that office or agency.) The 
parent must be given an opportunity to explain why such offer was not 
accepted. Questions with respect to the following factors must be 
resolved:
    (a) That there was a definite offer of employment at wages meeting 
any applicable minimum wage requirements and which are customary for 
such work in the community;
    (b) Any questions as to the parent's inability to engage in such 
employment for physical reasons or because he has no way to get to or 
from the particular job; and
    (c) Any questions of working conditions, such as risks to health, 
safety, or lack of worker's compensation protection.
    (iii) Such parent (a) has six or more quarters of work (as defined 
in paragraph (a)(3)(iv) of this section), within any 13-calendar-quarter 
period ending within 1 year prior to the application for such aid, or 
(b) within such 1-year period, received unemployment compensation under 
an unemployment compensation law of a State or of the United States, or 
was qualified under the terms of paragraph (a)(3)(v) of this section) 
for such compensation under the State's unemployment compensation law.
    (iv) A ``quarter of work'' with respect to any individual means a 
period (of 3 consecutive calendar months ending on March 31, June 30, 
September 30, or December 31) in which he or she received earned income 
of not less than $50 (or which is a ``quarter of coverage'' as defined 
in section 213(a)(2) of the Act), or in which he or she participated in 
a community work experience program under section 409 of the Act or the 
work incentive program established under title IV-C of the Act.
    (v) An individual shall be deemed ``qualified'' for unemployment 
compensation under the State's unemployment compensation law if he would 
have been eligible to receive such benefits upon filing application, or 
he performed work not covered by such law which, if it had been covered, 
would (together with any covered work he performed) have made him 
eligible to receive such benefits upon filing application.
    (vi)(A) The ``parent who is the principal earner'' means, in the 
case of any child, whichever parent, in a home in which both parents of 
such child are living, earned the greater amount of income in the 24-
month period the last month of which immediately precedes the month in 
which an application is filed for aid under this part on the basis of 
the unemployment of a parent. If the State cannot secure primary 
evidence of earnings for this period, the State shall designate the 
principal

[[Page 121]]

earner, using the best evidence available. The earnings of each parent 
are considered in determining the principal earner regardless of when 
their relationship began. The principal earner so defined remains the 
principal earner for each consecutive month for which the family 
receives such aid on the basis of such application. This requirement 
applies to both new applicants and current AFDC unemployed parent 
families who were eligible and receiving aid prior to October 1, 1981.
    (B) If both parents earned an identical amount of income (or earned 
no income) in such 24-month period, the State shall designate which 
parent shall be the principal earner.
    (vii) The parent who is the principal earner (unless exempt under 
Sec. 240.14) has met the requirements for participation in an employment 
search program under part 240 of this chapter.
    (4) Provide for entering into cooperative arrangements with the 
State agency responsible for administering or supervising the 
administration of vocational education to assure maximum utilization of 
available public vocational education services and facilities in the 
State to encourage the retraining of individuals capable of being 
retrained.
    (5) Provide for the denial of such aid to any such dependent child 
or the relative specified in section 406(a)(1) of the Act with whom such 
child is living,
    (i) If and for so long as such child's parent, unless exempt under 
Sec. 224.20, is not currently registered for the work incentive program 
or if exempt under Sec. 224.20(b)(6), is not currently registered with a 
public employment office in the State, except that in a State with an 
approved JOBS plan under Sec. 250.20, such child's parent, unless exempt

Sec. 233.101  Dependent children of unemployed parents.

    (a) Requirements for State Plans. Effective October 1, 1990 (for 
Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, and the Virgin Islands, October 1, 
1992), a State plan must provide for payment of AFDC for children of 
unemployed parents. A State plan under title IV-A for payment of such 
aid must:
    (1) Include a definition of an unemployed parent who is the 
principal earner which shall apply only to families determined to be 
needy in accordance with the provisions in Sec. 233.20 of this part. 
Such definition must include any such parent who:
    (i) Is employed less than 100 hours a month; or
    (ii) Exceeds that standard for a particular month, if the work is 
intermittent and the excess is of a temporary nature as evidenced by the 
fact that he or she was under the 100-hour standard for the prior 2 
months and is expected to be under the standard during the next month; 
except that at the option of the State, such definition need not include 
a principal earner who is unemployed because of participation in a labor 
dispute (other than a strike) or by reason of conduct or circumstances 
which result or would result in disqualification for unemployment 
compensation under the State's unemployment compensation law.
    (2) Include a definition of a dependent child which shall include 
any child of an unemployed parent (as defined by the State pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section) who would be, except for the fact that 
his parent is not dead, absent from the home, or incapacitated, a 
dependent child under the

[[Page 123]]

State's plan approved under section 402 of the Act.
    (3) Provide for payment of aid with respect to any dependent child 
(as defined by the State pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section) 
when the conditions set forth in paragraphs (a)(3)(i), (a)(3)(ii), and 
(a)(3)(iii) of this section are met.
    (i) His or her parent who is the principal earner has been 
unemployed for at least 30 days prior to the receipt of such aid;
    (ii) Such parent has not without good cause, within such 30-day 
period prior to the receipt of such aid, refused a bona fide offer of 
employment or training for employment. Before it is determined that such 
parent has refused a bona fide offer of employment or training for 
employment without good cause, the agency must make a determination that 
such offer was actually made. (In the case of offers of employment made 
through the public employment or manpower agencies, the determination as 
to whether the offer was bona fide, or whether there was good cause to 
refuse it, shall be made by the title IV-A agency. The IV-A agency may 
accept the recommendations of such agencies.) The parent must be given 
an opportunity to explain why such offer was not accepted. Questions 
with respect to the following factors must be resolved:
    (A) That there was a definite offer of employment at wages meeting 
any applicable minimum wage requirements and which are customary for 
such work in the community;
    (B) Any questions as to the parent's inability to engage in such 
employment for physical reasons or because he has no way to get to or 
from the particular job; and
    (C) Any questions of working conditions, such as risks to health, 
safety, or lack of worker's compensation protection.
    (iii) Such parent:
    (A) Has six or more quarters of work (as defined in paragraph 
(a)(3)(iv) of this section), within any 13-calendar-quarter period 
ending within one year prior to the application for such aid, or
    (B) Within such 1-year period, received unemployment compensation 
under an unemployment compensation law of a State or of the United 
States, or was qualified under the terms of paragraph (a)(3)(v) of this 
section for such compensation under the State's unemployment 
compensation law.
    (iv) A ``quarter of work'' with respect to any individual means a 
period (of 3 consecutive calendar months ending on March 31, June 30, 
September 30, or December 31):
    (A) In which an individual received earned income of not less than 
$50 (or which is a ``quarter of coverage'' as defined in section 
213(a)(2) of the Social Security Act) or participated in a program under 
part 250 of this chapter; or
    (B) At State option (as specified in the plan), in one or more 
subdivisions of the State, in which he or she attended, full-time, an 
elementary school, a secondary school, or a vocational or technical 
training course that is designed to prepare the individual for gainful 
employment, or in which the individual participated in an educational or 
training program established under the Job Training Partnership Act, 
provided that an individual may qualify for no more than four quarters 
of work under this paragraph for purposes of the requirement set forth 
in paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(A) of this section; and
    (C) A calendar quarter ending before October 1990 in which an 
individual participated in CWEP under section 409 of the Social Security 
Act or the WIN program established under title IV-C of the Social 
Security Act (as in effect for a State immediately before the effective 
date of that State's JOBS program).
    (v) An individual shall be deemed ``qualified'' for unemployment 
compensation under the State's unemployment compensation law if he or 
she would have been eligible to receive such benefits upon filing an 
application, or he performed work not covered by such law, which, if it 
had been covered, would (together with any covered work he performed) 
have made him eligible to receive such benefits upon filing an 
application.
    (vi)(A) The ``parent who is the principal earner'' means, in the 
case of any child, whichever parent, in a home in which both parents of 
such child are living, earned the greater amount of

[[Page 124]]

income in the 24-month period the last month of which immediately 
precedes the month in which an application is filed for aid under this 
part on the basis of the unemployment of a parent. If the State cannot 
secure primary evidence of earnings for this period, the State shall 
designate the principal earner, using the best evidence available. The 
earnings of each parent are considered in determining the principal 
earner regardless of when their relationship began. The principal earner 
so defined remains the principal earner for each consecutive month for 
which the family receives such aid on the basis of such application. 
This requirement applies to both new applicants and current AFDC 
unemployed parent families who were eligible and receiving aid prior to 
October 1, 1981.
    (B) If both parents earned an identical amount of income (or earned 
no income) in such 24-month period, the State shall designate which 
parent shall be the principal earner.
    (4) Provide for entering into cooperative arrangements with the 
State agency responsible for administering or supervising the 
administration of vocational education to assure maximum utilization of 
available public vocational education services and facilities in the 
State to encourage the retraining of individuals capable of being 
retrained.
    (5) Provide that the needs of the child's parent(s) shall not be 
taken into account in determining the needs and amount of assistance of 
the child's family:
    (i) If and for so long as such child's parent(s), unless exempt 
under Sec. 250.30(b) of this chapter, is not currently participating (or 
available for participation) in a program under part 250 of this chapter 
or, if they are exempt under Sec. 250.30(b)(5) of this chapter (or 
because a JOBS program has not been established in the subdivision where 
they reside or they reside in a JOBS subdivision but there is no 
appropriate JOBS activity in which they can participate), are not 
registered with a public employment office in the State, and
    (ii) With respect to any week for which such child's parent 
qualifies for unemployment compensation under an unemployment 
compensation law of the State or of the United States but refuses to 
apply for or accept such unemployment compensation.
    (6) Provide that medical assistance will be furnished under the 
State's approved plan under title XIX during any month in which an 
otherwise eligible individual is denied assistance solely by reason of 
the time limitation provided under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
    (b) State Plan Options. A State plan under title IV-A may:
    (1) Require the principal earner or both parents to participate in 
an activity in the JOBS program under part 250 of this chapter, subject 
to the limitations and conditions of part 250 of this chapter, provided 
that the participation of each parent in all required activities under 
the JOBS program does not exceed 40 hours per week, per parent.
    (2) Provide cash assistance after the performance of assigned 
program activities by parents required to participate in an activity in 
the JOBS program under part 250 of this chapter (as provided in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section) so long as the State:
    (i) Makes assistance payments at regular intervals at least monthly,
    (ii) Prescribes a set of criteria which defines goals or standards 
for each assigned activity in the JOBS program which must be completed 
by the participant prior to payment, and
    (iii) Prior to, or concurrent with, assignment to an activity, 
notifies the participant of the prescribed goals or standards and that 
payment for a period will be withheld unless performance of each 
assigned activity for that period is completed.
    (3) Provide for a State to operate a payment after performance 
system under which a family is issued an assistance payment after the 
applicable family member has successfully completed her obligation to 
participate in JOBS for a specific period. If the applicable family 
member fails without good cause to satisfy the obligation, the State 
may:
    (i) Impose a sanction in accordance with the JOBS program rules at 
Secs. 250.34, 250.35 and 250.36 of this chapter;

[[Page 125]]

    (ii) Reduce the family's assistance payment to which the specific 
period applies by the amount of the payment attributable to the family 
member for that period or do not make the payment to the family; or
    (iii) Reduce the family's assistance payment to which the specific 
period applies (or the amount of the payment attributable to the family 
member for that period) in proportion to the number of required hours 
that were not completed.

For States that elect to implement paragraphs (b)(3) (ii) or (iii) of 
this section, the fair hearing requirements set forth at 
Sec. 205.10(a)(4)(ii)(K) of this chapter apply.

    (4) Limit the number of months that a family may receive AFDC-UP 
under this section when the following conditions are met:
    (i) The State did not have on September 26, 1988, an approved AFDC-
UP program under section 407 of the Social Security Act.
    (ii) The family received such aid (on the basis of the unemployment 
of the parent who is the principal earner) in at least 6 of the 
preceding 12 months.
    (iii) The State has in effect a program (described in the plan) for 
providing education, training, and employment services to assist parents 
in preparing for and obtaining employment throughout the year. Such a 
program may include education, training and employment activities under 
the JOBS program which are provided in part 250 of this chapter or under 
a State-designed program which provides:
    (A) Education and instruction for individuals who have not graduated 
from a secondary school or obtained an equivalent degree,
    (B) Training whereby an individual acquires market-oriented skills 
necessary for self-support, and
    (C) Employment services which seek to place individuals in jobs.
    (iv) The State must guarantee child care necessary for an individual 
to participate in an approved, State-designed, non-JOBS program. The 
regulations at part 255 of this chapter apply to such care.
    (v) The State has the option of providing necessary supportive 
services associated with an individual's participation in a State-
designed, non-JOBS program. Federal financial participation is available 
under sections 403 (k) and (l) of the Social Security Act. The 
regulations at part 255 of this chapter apply to such supportive 
services.
    (vi) The State must inform an AFDC-UP family at the time of 
application that AFDC-UP cash assistance will terminate due to a time 
limitation, that any family with a child who is (or becomes) deprived 
due to the death, continued absence, or incapacity of a parent may 
receive cash assistance under the AFDC program during the time 
limitation for AFDC-UP, and that a program of training, education, and 
employment services is available to prepare the family to become self-
supporting.
    (vii) Prior to termination due to a time limitation, the State must 
notify an AFDC-UP recipient family of the earliest month that it may 
receive AFDC-UP cash assistance again. This notification may be included 
in the notice of proposed action which is required pursuant to 
Sec. 205.10(a)(4) of this chapter. To receive assistance again, the 
family must make a new application.
    (viii) In establishing eligibility upon re-application following 
months of nonpayment due to the time limitation, an otherwise eligible 
family that does not receive aid in a month solely by reason of the 
option to limit assistance under this paragraph shall be deemed, for 
purposes of determining the period under paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(A) of 
this section, to be receiving AFDC-UP cash assistance in that month. 
This provision also applies if, at the time of the family's original 
application for assistance, eligibility was established based on the 
provisions of paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(B) of this section, but eligibility 
could have been established based on the provisions of paragraph 
(a)(3)(iii)(A) of this section.
    (c) Federal Financial Participation. (1) Federal financial 
participation is available for payments authorized in accordance with 
the State plan approved under section 402 of the Act as aid to families 
with dependent children with respect to a child:
    (i) Who meets the requirements of section 406(a)(2) of the Act;

[[Page 126]]

    (ii) Who is living with any of the relatives specified in section 
406(a)(1) of the Act in a place of residence maintained by one or more 
of such relatives as his (or their) own home;
    (iii) Who has been deprived of parental support or care by reason of 
the fact that his or her parent who is the principal earner is employed 
less than 100 hours a month; or exceeds that standard for a particular 
month if his or her work is intermittent and the excess is of a 
temporary nature as evidenced by the fact that he or she was under the 
100-hour standard for 2 prior months and is expected to be under the 
standard during the next month;
    (iv) Whose parent who is the principal earner:
    (A) Has six or more quarters of work (as defined in paragraph 
(a)(3)(iv) of this section) within any 13-calendar-quarter period ending 
within 1 year prior to the application for such aid,
    (B) Within such 1-year period, received unemployment compensation 
under an unemployment compensation law of a State or of the United 
States, or was qualified (under the terms of paragraph (a)(3)(v) of this 
section) for such compensation under the State's unemployment 
compensation law; and
    (v) Whose parent who is the principal earner:
    (A) Is currently participating in or available to participate in an 
activity in the JOBS program under part 250 of this chapter, unless 
exempt, or is registered with the public employment office in the State 
if exempt from the JOBS program under Sec. 250.30(b)(5) of this chapter; 
and
    (B) Has not refused to apply for or accept unemployment compensation 
with respect to any week for which such child's parent qualifies for 
unemployment compensation under an unemployment compensation law of the 
State or of the United States.
    (2) The State may not include in its claim for Federal financial 
participation payments made as aid under the plan with respect to a 
child who meets the conditions set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section, where such payments were made:
    (i) For any part of the 30-day period specified in paragraph 
(a)(3)(i) of this section;
    (ii) For such 30-day period if during that period the parent refused 
without good cause a bona fide offer of employment or training for 
employment;
    (iii) For any period beginning with the 31st day after the receipt 
of aid, if and for as long as no action is taken during the period to 
undertake appropriate steps directed toward the participation of the 
parent who is the principal earner in a program under part 250 of this 
chapter;
    (iv) To the extent that such payments are made to meet the need of 
an individual who is subject to a sanction imposed, under part 250 of 
this chapter (for failure to meet the requirements for participation in 
the JOBS program).
    (3) Federal financial participation is available for child care and 
supportive services expenditures associated with participation in an 
approved State-designed program (as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of 
this section) under titles IV-A and IV-F of the Act respectively. 
However, Federal financial participation is not available for any other 
costs, program or administrative, associated with State-designed 
programs.
    (d) For all States (other than Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, 
and the Virgin Islands) the provisions of this section are in effect 
through September 30, 1998. For Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, and 
the Virgin Islands, the provisions of this section are in effect from 
October 1, 1992, through September 30, 1998.

Sec. 233.106  Denial of AFDC benefits to strikers.

    (a) Condition for plan approval. A State plan under title IV-A of 
the Social Security Act must:
    (1) Provide that participation in a strike shall not constitute good 
cause to leave, or to refuse to seek or accept, employment.
    (2)(i) Provide for the denial of AFDC benefits to any family for any 
month in which any caretaker relative with whom the child is living is, 
on the last day of such month, participating in a strike; and
    (ii) Provide that no individual's needs shall be included in 
determining the

[[Page 127]]

National Labor Relations Board definition (29 U.S.C. 142(2)) or another 
definition of the term that is currently in State law.

<R05>
Sec. 233.107  Restriction in payment to households headed by a minor parent.

    (a) State plan requirements. A State in its title IV-A State plan 
may provide that a minor parent and the dependent child in his or her 
care must reside in the household of a parent, legal guardian, or other 
adult relative, or in an adult-supervised supportive living arrangement 
in order to receive, AFDC unless:
    (1) The minor parent has no living parent or legal guardian whose 
whereabouts is known;
    (2) No living parent or legal guardian of the minor parent allows 
the minor parent to live in his or her home;
    (3) The minor parent lived apart from his or her own parent or legal 
guardian for a period of at least one year before either the birth of 
the dependent child or the parent's having made application for AFDC;
    (4) The physical or emotional health or safety of the minor parent 
or dependent child would be jeopardized if they resided in the same 
residence with the minor parent's parent or legal guardian;
    (5) There is otherwise good cause for the minor parent and dependent 
child to receive assistance while living apart from the minor parent's 
parent, legal guardian, or other adult relative, or an adult-supervised 
supportive living arrangement.
    (b) Allegations. If a minor parent makes allegations supporting the 
conclusion that paragraph (a)(4) of this section applies, the State 
agency shall determine whether it is justified.
    (c) Good Cause. The circumstances justifying a determination of good 
cause must be set forth in the State plan.
    (d) Protective Payments. When a minor parent and his or her 
dependent child are required to live with the minor parent's parent, 
legal guardian, or other adult relative, or in an adult-supervised 
supportive living arrangement, then AFDC is paid (where possible) in the 
form of a protective payment.
    (e) Definitions: For purposes of this section:
    (1) A minor parent is an individual who (i) is under the age of 18, 
(ii) has never been married, and (iii) is either the natural parent of a 
dependent child living in the same household or eligible for assistance 
paid under the State plan to a pregnant woman as provided in 
Sec. 233.90(c)(2)(iv) of this part.
    (2) A household of a parent, legal guardian, or other adult 
relatives means the place of residence of (i) a natural or adoptive 
parent or a stepparent, or (ii) a legal guardian as defined by the 
State, or (iii) another individual who is age 18 or over and related to 
the minor parent as specified in Sec. 233.90(c)(1)(v) of this part 
provided that the residence is maintained as a home for the minor parent 
and child as provided in Sec. 233.90(c)(1)(v)(B) of this part.
    (3) An adult-supervised supportive living arrangement means a 
private family setting or other living arrangement (not including a 
public institution), which, as determined by the State, is maintained as 
a family setting, as evidenced by the assumption of responsibility for 
the care and control of the minor parent and dependent child or the 
provision of supportive services, such as counseling, guidance, or 
supervision. For example, foster homes and maternity homes are ``adult-
supervised supportive living arrangements.''
    (f) Notice Requirements. Minor applicants shall be informed about 
the eligibility requirements and their rights and obligations consistent 
with the provisions at Sec. 206.10(a)(2)(i). For example, a State may 
wish to: (1) Advise the minor of the possible exemptions and 
specifically ask whether one or more of these exemptions is applicable; 
and (2)

[[Page 128]]

assist the minor in attaining the necessary verifications if one or more 
of these exemptions is alleged.

A, of the Social Security Act, providing for emergency assistance to 
needy families with children must:
    (1) Specify the eligibility conditions imposed for the receipt of 
emergency assistance. These conditions may be more liberal than those

providing payments, medical care, and other remedial care.
    (4) Specify which of the following services will be provided: 
Information, referral, counseling, securing family shelter, child care, 
legal services, and any other services that meet needs attributable to 
the emergency or unusual crisis situations.
    (5) Provide that emergency assistance will be given forthwith.
    (b) Federal financial participation. Beginning with the effective 
date of approval of the amendment to the State plan for AFDC which 
provides for emergency assistance to needy families with children 
pursuant to section 406(e) of the Act:
    (1) Federal financial participation is available for emergency 
assistance to or on behalf of a needy child under the age of 21 and any 
other member of the household in which he is living if:
    (i) Such child is (or, within 6 months prior to the month in which 
such assistance is requested, has been) living with any of the relatives 
specified in section 406(a)(1) of the Act in a place of residence 
maintained by one or more of such relatives as his or their own home,
    (ii) Such child is without resources immediately accessible to meet 
his needs,
    (iii) The emergency assistance is necessary to avoid destitution of 
such child or to provide living arrangements for him in a home, and
    (iv) His destitution or need for living arrangements did not arise 
because he or such relative refused without good cause to accept 
employment or training for employment.
    (2) The rate of Federal financial participation in expenditures 
during a quarter as emergency assistance in accordance with the 
provisions of an approved State plan is 50 percent of the total amount 
of such expenditures which are (i) in the form of money payments, 
payments in kind, or such other payments as the State agency specifies, 
including loans and vendor payments, or medical or remedial care 
recognized under State law, with respect to or on behalf of individuals 
described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section; (ii) for administration, 
including costs incurred in determining eligibility, in the payment 
process, and for other related administrative activities; and (iii) for 
the following services provided to individuals described in paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section, directly by staff of the agency, or by purchase 
from other sources: Information, referral, counseling, securing family 
shelter, child care, legal services, and any other services that meet 
needs attributable to the emergency or unusual crisis situations.
    (3) Federal matching is available only for emergency assistance 
which the State authorizes during one period of 30 consecutive days in 
any 12 consecutive months, including payments which are to meet needs 
which arose

[[Page 129]]

before such 30-day period or are for such needs as rent which extend 
beyond the 30-day period. Another condition for Federal participation is 
that the State has a reasonable method of determining the value of goods 
in kind or services provided for emergency assistance.

Sec. 233.145  Expiration of medical assistance programs under titles I, IV-A, X, XIV and XVI of the Social Security Act.

    (a) Under the provisions of section 121(b) of Pub. L. 89-97, enacted 
July 30, 1965, no payment may be made to any State under title I, IV-A, 
X, XIV or XVI of the Social Security Act for aid or assistance in the 
form of medical or any other type of remedial care for any period after 
December 31, 1969. However, these provisions do not affect the 
availability of Federal financial participation in the cost of medical 
or remedial care furnished under title IV-A of the Act (pursuant to 
sections 403(a)(5) and 406(e) ) of the Act, as emergency assistance to 
needy families with children (see Sec. 233.120 of this part), subject to 
the provisions of paragraph (c) <SUP>1</SUP> of this section. Federal 
financial participation in vendor payments for medical care and services 
is not otherwise available except under title XIX of the Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <SUP>1</SUP>  See notice published Aug. 29, 1973 (38 FR 23337).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Under the provisions of section 4(c) of Pub. L. 92-223, enacted 
December 28, 1971, and the provisions of section 292 of Pub. L. 92-603, 
enacted October 30, 1972:
    (1) In the case of any State which on January 1, 1972, had in effect 
a State plan approved under title XIX of the Social Security Act, 
section 1121 of the Act authorizing payments under title I, X, XIV, or 
XVI of the Act for assistance in the form of institutional services in 
intermediate care facilities is rescinded; and
    (2) In the case of any State which on January 1, 1972, did not have 
in effect a State plan approved under title XIX of the Act, Federal 
financial participation is available in assistance in the form of 
institutional services in intermediate care facilities pursuant to 
section 1121 of the Act and under the provisions of Sec. 234.130 of this 
chapter until the first day of the first month after January 1, 1972, 
that the State has in effect a State plan approved under title XIX.
    (c)(1) Under the provisions of section 249D of Pub. L. 92-603, 
enacted October 30, 1972, Federal matching is not available for any 
portion of any payment by any State under titles I, IV-A, X, XIV, or XVI 
of the Social Security Act for or on account of any medical or any other 
type of remedial care provided by an institution to any individual as an 
inpatient thereof, in the case of any State which has a plan approved 
under title XIX of such Act, if such care is (or could be provided, 
under a State plan approved under title XIX of such Act, by an 
institution certified under such title XIX. The effective date of this 
proposed provision will be the date of publication of the final 
regulation in the Federal Register.
    (2) For purposes of this paragraph,
    (i) An institution (see Sec. 233.60(b)(1) of this chapter) is 
considered to provide medical or remedial care if it provides any care 
or service beyond room and board because of the physical or mental 
condition (or both) of its inpatients;
    (ii) An inpatient is an individual who is living in an institution 
which provides medical or remedial care and who is receiving care or 
service beyond room and board because of his physical or mental 
condition (or both).
    (iii) Federal financial participation is not available for any 
portion of the payment for care of an inpatient. It is immaterial 
whether such payment is made as a vendor payment or as a money payment 
or other cash assistance payment. It is also immaterial whether the 
payment is divided into components, such as separate amounts or payments 
for room and board, and for care or services beyond room and board, or 
whether the payment is considered to meet ``basic'' needs or ``special'' 
needs. If, however, a money payment (or protective payment) is made to 
an individual who is living in an institution, and such payment does not 
exceed a reasonable rate for room, board and laundry for individuals not

[[Page 130]]

living in their own homes, and no additional payment is made for such 
individual's care in the institution, Federal financial participation is 
available in the money payment (or protective payment) since the 
individual may spend the funds at his discretion and obtain room and 
board at the place of his choice.
    (iv) Federal financial participation is available in cash assistance 
payments to meet the needs of an inpatient for specific medical 
services, such as dental care or prescription drugs, which generally are 
not delivered in an institutional setting and in fact are not provided 
by the institution to the inpatient, provided that such services are not 
available to the individual under the State's approved title XIX plan.

Social Security Act to eligible families and individuals. Money payments 
are payments in cash, checks, or warrants immediately redeemable at par,

<R05>
Sec. 234.60  Protective, vendor and two-party payments for dependent children.

    (a) State plan requirements. (1) If a State plan for AFDC under 
title IV-A of the Social Security Act provides for protective, vendor 
and two-party payments for cases other than failure to participate in 
the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training (JOBS) Program under 
Sec. 250.34(d), or failure by the caretaker relative to meet the 
eligibility requirements of Sec. 232.11, 232.12, or 232.13 of this 
chapter. It must meet the requirements in paragraphs (a) (2) through 
(11) of this section. In addition, the plan may provide for protective, 
vendor, and two-party payments at the request of recipients as provided 
in paragraph (a)(14) of this section.
    (2)(i) Methods will be in effect to identify children whose 
relatives have demonstrated such an inability to manage funds that 
payments to the relative have not been or are not currently used in the 
best interest of the child. This means that the relative has misused 
funds to such an extent that allowing him or her to manage the AFDC 
grant is a threat to the health or safety of the child.
    (ii) States will establish criteria to determine if mismanagement 
exists. Under this provision, States may elect to use as one criterion a 
presumption of mismanagement based on a recipient's nonpayment of rent.
    (iii) Under State agency procedures, the recipient shall be notified 
whenever a creditor requests a protective, vendor, or two-party payment 
for mismangement on the basis of non-payment of bills.
    (iv) The recipient shall be notified by the agency of a decision not 
to use a protective, vendor, or two-party payment if such payment has 
been requested by a creditor.
    (v) A statement of the specific reasons that demonstrate the need 
for making protective, vendor, and two-party payments must be placed in 
the file of the child involved.
    (3) Criteria will be established to identify the circumstances under 
which protective, vendor, or two-party payments will be made in whole or 
in part to:

[[Page 131]]

    (i) Another individual who is interested in or concerned with the 
welfare of the child or relative; or
    (ii) A person or persons furnishing food, living accommodations or 
other goods, services, or items to or for the child, relative, or 
essential person.
    (4) Procedures will be established for making protective, vendor, or 
two-party payments. Under this provision, part of the payment may be 
made to the family and part may be made to a protective payee or to a 
vendor, or part may be made in the form of two-party payments, i.e., 
checks which are drawn jointly to the order of the recipient and the 
person furnishing goods, services, or items and negotiable only upon 
endorsement by both the recipient and the other person.
    (5)--(6) [Reserved]
    (7) Standards will be established for selection:
    (i) Of protective payees, who are interested in or concerned with 
the recepient's welfare, to act for the recipient in receiving and 
managing assistance, with the selection of a protective payee being made 
by the recipient, or with his participation and consent, to the extent 
possible. If it is in the best interest of the recipient for a staff 
member of a private agency, of the public welfare department, or of any 
other appropriate organization to serve as a protective payee, such 
selection will be made preferably from the staff of an agency or that 
part of the agency providing protective services for families; and the 
public welfare department will employ such additional staff as may be 
necessary to provide protective payees. The selection will not include: 
The executive head of the agency administering public assistance; the 
person determining financial eligibility for the family; special 
investigative or resource staff; or staff handling fiscal processes 
related to the recipient; or landlords, grocers, or other vendors of 
goods, services, or items dealing directly with the recipient.
    (ii) Of such persons providing goods, services, or items with the 
selection of such persons being made by the recipient, or with his 
participation and consent, to the extent possible.
    (8) The agency will undertake and continue special efforts to 
develop greater ability on the part of the relative to manage funds in 
such manner as to protect the welfare of the family.
    (9) Review will be made as frequently as indicated by the 
individual's circumstances, and at least once every 12 months, of:
    (i) The need for protective, vendor, and two-party payments; and
    (ii) The way in which a protective payee's responsibilities are 
carried out.
    (10) Provision will be made for termination of protective payments, 
or payments to a person furnishing goods or services, as follows:
    (i) When relatives are considered able to manage funds in the best 
interest of the child, there will be a return to money payment status.
    (ii) When it appears that need for protective, vendor, or two-party 
payments will continue or is likely to continue beyond 2 years because 
all efforts have not resulted in sufficiently improved use of assistance 
in behalf of the child, judicial appointment of a guardian or other 
legal representative will be sought and such payments will terminate 
when the appointment has been made.
    (11)(i) Opportunity for a fair hearing pursuant to Sec. 205.10 will 
be given to any individual claiming assistance in relation to the 
determination:
    (A) That a protective, vendor, and two-party payment should be made 
or continued.
    (B) As to the payee selected.
    (ii) In cases where the agency has elected the option to presume 
mismanagement based on a recipient's nonpayment of rent pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(2)(ii), the agency may also elect the option to provide 
the opportunity for a fair hearing pursuant to Sec. 205.10 either before 
or after the manner or form of payment has been changed for these cases.
    (12) In cases where an individual is sanctioned for failure to 
participate in WIN, employment search, CWEP, or JOBS, the State plan 
must provide that when protective or vendor payments are made pursuant 
to Sec. 224.52(a)(1), Sec. 238.22, Sec. 240.22(a)(1), Sec. 240.22(b)(1) 
and Sec. 250.34(d) of this chapter, only paragraphs (a)(7), (a)(9)(ii), 
and (a)(11)(i) and (ii) of this section will

[[Page 132]]

be applicable. Under these circumstances, when protective payments are 
made, the entire payment will be made to the protective payee; and when 
vendor payments are made, at least the greater part of the payment will 
be through this method. However, if after making all reasonable efforts, 
the State agency is unable to locate an appropriate individual to whom 
protective payments can be made, the State may continue to make payments 
on behalf of the remaining members of the assistance unit to the 
sanctioned caretaker relative. Provision will be made for termination of 
protective payments, or payments to a person furnishing goods or 
services, with return to money payment status when adults who refused 
training, employment, or participation in employment search without good 
cause either accept training, employment, or employment search or agree 
to do so. In the case of continuing refusal of the relative to 
participate, payments will be continued for the children in the home in 
accordance with this paragraph.
    (13) For cases in which a caretaker relative fails to meet the 
eligibility requirements of Secs. 232.11, 232.12, or 232.13 of this 
chapter by failing to assign rights to support or cooperate in 
determining paternity, securing support, or identifying and providing 
information to assist the State in pursuing third party liability for 
medical services, the State plan must provide that only the requirements 
of paragraphs (a)(7) and (9)(ii) of this section will be applicable. For 
such cases, the entire amount of the assistance payment will be in the 
form of protective or vendor payments. These protective or vendor 
payments will be terminated, with return to money payment status, only 
upon compliance by the caretaker relative with the eligibility 
requirements of Secs. 232.11, 232.12, and 232.13 of this chapter. 
However, if after making reasonable efforts, the State agency is unable 
to locate an appropriate individual to whom protective payments can be 
made, the State may continue to make payments to the sanctioned 
caretaker relative on behalf of the remaining members of the assistance 
unit.
    (14) If the plan provides for protective, vendor, or two-party 
payments:
    (i) The State may use any combination of protective, vendor, or two-
party payments (at the request of the recipient),
    (ii) The request must be in writing from the recipient to whom 
payment would otherwise be made in an unrestricted manner and must be 
recorded or retained in the case file, and
    (iii) The restriction will be discontinued promptly upon the written 
request of the recipient who initiated it.
    (b) Federal financial participation. Federal financial participation 
is available in payments which otherwise qualify as money payments with 
respect to an eligible dependent child, but which are made as 
protective, vendor or two-party payments under this section. Payrolls 
must identify protective, vendor, or two-party payments either by use of 
a separate payroll for these cases or by using a special identifying 
code or symbol on the regular payroll. The payment must be supported by 
an authorization of award through amendment of an existing authorization 
document for each case or by preparation of a separate authorization 
document. In either instance, the authorization document must be a 
formal agency record signed by a responsible agency official, showing 
the name of each eligible child and relative, the amount of payment 
authorized and the name of the protective, vendor or two-party payee.

<R05>
Sec. 234.70  Protective payments for the aged, blind, or disabled.

    (a) State plan requirements. If a State plan for OAA, AB, APTD, or 
AABD under the Social Security Act includes provisions for protective 
payments, the State plan must provide that:
    (1) Methods will be in effect to determine that needy individuals 
have, by reason of physical or mental condition, such inability to 
manage funds that making payment to them would be contrary to their 
welfare; such methods to include medical or psychological

[[Page 133]]

evaluations, or other reports of physical or mental conditions including 
observation of gross conditions such as extensive paralysis, serious 
mental retardation, continued disorientation, or severe memory loss.
    (2) There will be responsibility to assure referral to social 
services for appropriate action to protect recipients where problems and 
needs for services and care of the recipients are manifestly beyond the 
ability of the protective payee to handle. (See paragraph (a)(5) of this 
section.)
    (3) Standards will be established for selection of protective payees 
who are interested in or concerned with the individual's welfare, to act 
for the individual in receiving and managing assistance, with the 
selection of a protective payee being made by the individual, or with 
his participation and consent, to the extent possible. If it is in the 
best interest of the individual for a staff member of a private agency, 
of the public welfare department, or of any other appropriate 
organization to serve as a protective payee, such selection will be made 
preferably from the staff of an agency or that part of the agency 
providing protective services for families or for the disabled or aged 
group of which the recipient is a member; and such staff of the public 
welfare department will be utilized only to the extent that the 
department has adequate staff for this purpose. The selection will not 
include: The executive head of the agency administering public 
assistance; the person determining financial eligibility for the 
individual; special investigative or resource staff, or staff handling 
fiscal processes related to the recipient; or landlords, grocers, or 
other vendors of goods or services dealing directly with the recipient--
such as the proprietor, administrator or fiscal agent of a nursing home, 
or social care, medical or nonmedical institution, except for the 
superintendent of a public institution for mental diseases or a public 
institution for the mentally retarded, or the designee of such 
superintendent, when no other suitable protective payee can be found and 
there are appropriate staff available to assist the superintendent in 
carrying out the protective payment function.
    (4) Protective payments will be made only in cases in which the 
assistance payment, with other available income, meets all the needs of 
the individual, using the State's standards for assistance for the 
pertinent program, not standards for protective payment cases only.
    (5) The agency will undertake and continue special efforts to 
protect the welfare of such individuals and to improve, to the extent 
possible, their capacity for self-care and to manage funds.
    (6) Reconsideration of the need for protective payments and the way 
in which a protective payee's responsibilities are carried out will be 
as frequent as indicated by the individual's circumstances and at least 
every 6 months.
    (7) Provision will be made for appropriate termination of protective 
payments as follows:
    (i) When individuals are considered able to manage funds in their 
best interest, there will be a return to money payment status.
    (ii) When a judicial appointment of a guardian or other legal 
representative appears to serve the best interest of the individual, 
such appointment will be sought and the protective payment will 
terminate when the appointment has been made.
    (8) Opportunity for a fair hearing will be given to any individual 
claiming assistance in relation to the determination that a protective 
payment should be made or continued, and in relation to the payee 
selected.
    (b) Federal financial participation. Federal financial participation 
is available for payments, which otherwise qualify as money payments 
with respect to a needy individual, but which are made to a protective 
payee under paragraph (a)(3) of this section. The payment must be 
supported by an authorization of award through amendment of an existing 
authorization document for such case or by preparation of a separate 
authorization document. In either instance, the authorization document 
must be a formal agency record signed by a responsible agency official 
showing the name of each eligible individual, the amount of payment

[[Page 134]]

authorized and the name of the protective payee. Payrolls must identify 
protective payment cases either by use of a separate payroll for these 
cases or by using a special identifying code or symbol on the regular 
payroll.

    At the option of a State, if its plan approved under title I, X, 
XIV, or XVI of the Social Security Act so provides, Federal financial 
participation under such title is available in rent payments made 
directly to a public housing agency on behalf of a recipient or a group 
or groups of recipients of OAA, AB, APTD, or AABD. Such Federal 
financial participation is available in rent payments only to the extent 
that they do not exceed the amount included for rent under the State's 
standard of assistance or the amount of rent due under applicable law, 
whichever is less.

Sec. 234.130  Assistance in the form of institutional services in intermediate care facilities.

    (a) Applicability and State plan requirements. A State which, on 
January 1, 1972, did not have in effect a State plan approved under 
title XIX of the Social Security Act may provide assistance under title 
I, X, XIV, or XVI of the Act in the form of institutional services in 
intermediate care facilities as authorized under title XI of the Act, 
until the first day of the first month (occurring after January 1, 1972) 
that such State does have in effect a State plan approved under title 
XIX of the Act. In any State which may provide such assistance as 
authorized under title XI of the Act, a State plan under title I, X, 
XIV, or XVI of the Act which includes such assistance must:
    (1) Provide that such benefits will be provided only to individuals 
who:
    (i) Are entitled (or would, if not receiving institutional services 
in intermediate care facilities, be entitled) to receive assistance, 
under the State plan, in the form of money payments; and
    (ii) Because of their physical or mental condition (or both) require 
living accommodations and care which, as a practical matter, can be made 
available to them only through institutional facilities; and
    (iii) Do not have such an illness, disease, injury, or other 
condition as to require the degree of care and treatment which a 
hospital or skilled nursing home (as that term is employed in title XIX) 
is designed to provide.
    (2) Provide that, in determining financial eligibility for benefits 
in the form of institutional services in intermediate care facilities, 
available income will be applied, first for personal

[[Page 135]]

and incidental needs including clothing, and that any remaining income 
will be applied to the costs of care in the intermediate care facility.
    (3) Provide methods of administration that include:
    (i) Placing of responsibility, within the State agency, with one or 
more staff members with sufficient staff time exclusive of other duties 
to direct and guide the agency's activities with respect to services in 
intermediate care facilities, including arrangements for consultation 
and working relationships with the State standard-setting authority and 
State agencies responsible for mental health and for mental retardation;
    (ii) In relation to authorization of benefits, provisions for 
evaluation by a physician of the individual's physical and mental 
condition and the kinds and amounts of care he requires; evaluation by 
the agency worker of the resources available in the home, family and 
community; and participation by the recipient in determining where he is 
to receive care, except that in the case of services being provided in a 
Christian Science Sanatorium, certification by a qualified Christian 
Science practitioner that the individual meets the requirements 
specified in paragraphs (a)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section may be 
substituted for the evaluation by a physician;
    (iii) Provisions for redetermination at least semiannually that the 
individual is properly a recipient of intermediate care.
    (4) Provide for regular, periodic review and reevaluation no less 
often than annually (by or on behalf of the State agency administering 
the plan and in addition to the activities described in paragraph (a)(3) 
of this section) of recipients in intermediate care facilities to 
determine whether their current physical and mental conditions are such 
as to indicate continued placement in the intermediate care facility, 
whether the services actually rendered are adequate and responsive to 
the conditions and needs identified, and whether a change to other 
living arrangements, or other institutional facilities (including 
skilled nursing homes) is indicated. Such reviews must be followed by 
appropriate action on the part of the State agency administering the 
plan. They must be conducted by or under the supervision of a physician 
with participation by a registered professional nurse and other 
appropriate medical and social service personnel not employed by or 
having a financial interest in the facility, except that, in the case of 
recipients who have elected care in a Christian Science sanatorium, 
review by a physician or other medical personnel is not required.
    (5) Provide that all services with respect to social and related 
problems which the agency makes available to applicants and recipients 
of assistance under the plan will be equally available to all applicants 
for and recipients of benefits in the form of institutional services in 
intermediate care facilities.
    (6) Specify the types of facilities, however described, that will 
qualify under the State plan for participation as intermediate care 
facilities, and provide for availability to the Department of Health and 
Human Services, upon request of (i) copies of the State's requirements 
for licensing of such facilities, (ii) any requirements imposed by the 
State in addition to licensing and to definition of intermediate care 
facilities, and (iii) a description of the manner in which such 
requirements are applied and enforced including copies of agreements or 
contracts, if any, with the licensing authority for this purpose.
    (7) Provide for and describe methods of determining amounts of 
vendor payments to intermediate care facilities which systematically 
relate amounts of the payment to the kinds, levels, and quantities of 
services provided to the recipients by the institutions and to the cost 
of providing such services.
    (b) Other requirements. Except when inconsistent with purposes of 
section 1121 of the Act or contrary to any provision therein, any 
modification, pursuant thereto, of an approved State plan shall be 
subject to the same conditions, limitations, rights, and obligations as 
obtained with respect to such approved State plan. Included specifically 
among such conditions and limitations are the provisions of titles I, X, 
XIV, and XVI relating to payments to or care in behalf of any individual 
who

[[Page 136]]

is an inmate of a public institution (except as a patient in a medical 
institution).
    (c) Federal financial participation. (1) Federal financial 
participation is available under section 1121 of the Act in vendor 
payments for institutional services provided to individuals who are 
eligible under the respective State plan and who are residents in 
intermediate care facilities. The rate of participation is the same as 
for money payments under the respective title or, if the State so 
elects, at the rate of the Federal medical assistance percentage as 
defined in section 1905(b) of the Act. Such Federal financial 
participation ends on the date specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section, or 12 months after the date when the State first has in effect 
a State plan approved under title XIX of the Act, whichever is later.
    (2) For the period from January 1, 1972, to the date on which a 
determination is made under the provisions of 42 CFR 449.33 as to a 
facility's eligibility to receive payments for intermediate care 
facility services under the medical assistance program, title XIX of the 
Act, but not later than 12 months following the effective date of these 
regulations, Federal financial participation in payments for such 
services under title XIX is governed by the provisions of this section, 
applied to State plans under title XIX.
    (d) Definition of terms. For purposes of section 1121 of the Social 
Security Act, the following definitions apply:
    (1) Institutional services. The term, institutional services, means 
those items and services provided by or under the auspices of the 
institution which contribute to the health, comfort, and well-being of 
the residents thereof; except that the term, institutional services, 
does not include allowances for clothing and incidental expenses for 
which money payments to recipients are made under the plan, nor does it 
include medical care, in a form identifiable as such and separable from 
the routine services of the facility, for which vendor payments may be 
made under a State plan approved under title XIX.
    (2) Distinct part of an institution. A distinct part of an 
institution is defined as a part which meets the definition of an 
intermediate care facility and the following conditions:
    (i) Identifiable unit. The distinct part of the institution is an 
entire unit such as an entire ward or contiguous wards, wing, floor, or 
building. It consists of all beds and related facilities in the unit and 
houses all residents, except as hereafter provided, for whom payment is 
being made for intermediate care. It is clearly identified and is 
approved, in writing, by the agency applying the definition of 
intermediate care facility herein.
    (ii) Staff. Appropriate personnel are assigned and work regularly in 
the unit. Immediate supervision of staff is provided in the unit at all 
time by qualified personnel.
    (iii) Shared facilities and services. The distinct part may share 
such central services and facilities as management services, building 
maintenance and laundry, with other units.
    (iv) Transfers between distinct parts. In a facility having distinct 
parts devoted to skilled nursing home care and intermediate care, which 
facility has been determined by the appropriate State agency to be 
organized and staffed to provide services according to individual needs 
throughout the institution, nothing herein shall be construed to require 
transfer of an individual within the institution when in the opinion of 
the individual's physician such transfer might be harmful to the 
physical or mental health of the individual.
    (3) Intermediate care facility. An intermediate care facility is an 
institution or a distinct part thereof which:
    (i) Is licensed, under State law to provide the residents thereof, 
on a regular basis, the range or level of care and services as defined 
in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, which is suitable to the needs of 
individuals who:
    (a) Because of their physical or mental limitations or both, require 
living accommodations and care which, as a practical matter, can be made 
available to them only through institutional facilities, and
    (b) Do not have such an illness, disease, injury, or other condition 
as to require the degree of care and treatment which a hospital or 
skilled nursing home (as that term is employed in title XIX is designed 
to provide:

[[Page 137]]

    (ii) Does not provide the degree of care required to be provided by 
a skilled nursing home furnishing services under a State plan approved 
under title XIX:
    (iii) Meets such standards of safety and sanitation as are 
applicable to nursing homes under State law; and
    (iv) Regularly provides a level of care and service beyond board and 
room.

The term intermediate care facility also includes a Christian Science 
sanatorium operated, or listed and certified, by the First Church of 
Christ, Scientist, Boston, Mass.

or other appropriate facilities;
    (c) The resident, his next of kin, and the responsible agency if 
any, are consulted in advance of the discharge of any resident, and 
casework services or other means are utilized to assure that adequate 
arrangements exist for meeting his needs through other resources.
    (ii) Personal care and protective services. The types and amounts of 
protection and personal service needed by each resident of the facility 
are a matter of record and are known to all staff members having 
personal contact with the resident. At least the following services are 
provided.

have been determined by their physicians not to be in need of such 
supervision and whose need for such supervision is reviewed as 
indicated, and at least quarterly;
    (b) Continuing supervision by a physician who sees the resident as

accommodations with no more than four residents occupying a room, with 
individual storage facilities for clothing and personal articles, and 
with lounge, recreation and dining areas provided apart from sleeping 
quarters.
    (ix) Administration and management. The direction and management of 
the facility are such as to assure that the services required by the 
residents are so organized and administered that they are, in fact, 
available to the residents on a regular basis and that this is

made no later than the close of the second year of the grant. The 
evaluation shall be conducted by representatives from the educational 
institution and the State agency to determine whether conditions and 
objectives described in the grant are being met. If the educational

Sec. 235.110  Fraud.

    State plan requirements: A State plan under title I, IV-A, X, XIV, 
or XVI of the Social Security Act must provide:
    (a) That the State agency will establish and maintain:
    (1) Methods and criteria for identifying situations in which a 
question of fraud in the program may exist, and
    (2) Procedures developed in cooperation with the State's legal 
authorities for referring to law enforcement officials situations in 
which there is valid reason to suspect that fraud has been practiced.

[[Page 143]]


The definition of fraud for purposes of this section will be determined 
in accordance with State law.
    (b) For methods of investigation of situations which there is a 
question of fraud, that do not infringe on the legal rights of persons 
involved and are consistent with the principles recognized as affording 
due process of law.
    (c) For the designation of official position(s) responsible for 
referral of situations involving suspected fraud to the proper 
authorities.

<R05>
Sec. 235.111  Pre-eligibility fraud detection measures.

    (a) State plan requirement. A State plan under title IV, part A of 
the Social Security Act must contain a description of the verification 
measures to detect fraudulent applications for AFDC prior to the 
establishment of eligibility for such aid.
    (b) Definition. For purposes of this section, verification measures 
are actions taken by a State agency (including actions taken by fraud 
personnel assigned to the initial application unit to investigate 
applicants suspected of committing fraud):
    (1) To confirm information provided by an applicant to support his 
or her eligibility for AFDC; and
    (2) To confirm information provided by an applicant that is relevant 
in determining the amount of the assistance payment.

Such actions involve the examination of supporting documentation in the 
applicant's possession and obtaining additional information, when 
necessary, from appropriate third party sources; also included are any 
periodic support activities taken by the State agency to enhance these 
actions. Examples of such measures include but are not limited to: 
Automated data matches to establish the accuracy of statements on the 
application; use of error prone profiles; home visists or collateral 
contacts; credit bureau inquiries; training on investigative 
interviewing techniques.
    (c) Annual evaluation. A State agency shall make a written 
evaluation for each Federal fiscal year of the effectiveness of its 
verification measures, submit a copy of the evaluation to the FSA 
Regional Office by February 15 of the following Federal fiscal year, and 
submit any appropriate amendments to its title IV-A State plan. The 
evaluation must include an assessment of verification measures such as 
home visits, credit bureau inquiries, data matches with entitlement 
programs, in addition to those included in the State's Income and 
Eligibility Verification System (IEVS), or other similar measures 
implemented by States. Information and data gathered in connection with 
a corrective action plan prepared pursuant to 45 CFR 205.40 may be 
utilized in preparing this evaluation.
    (d) Federal financial participation. Verification measures to detect 
fraudulent applications will be matched as administrative costs at a 50 
percent rate.

<R05>
Sec. 235.112  Optional AFDC Fraud Control Program.

    (a) Scope. A State agency under title IV-A may elect to establish 
and operate a fraud control program pursuant to section 416 of the Act. 
A State agency electing this optional program is required to proceed 
against any individual member of a family regardless of AFDC payment 
status who it believes to have committed an intentional program 
violation as described in paragraph (b) of this section through a State 
administrative hearing or by referring the matter to the appropriate 
authorities for civil or criminal action in a State or Federal court. In 
proceeding against such an individual, the State agency must coordinate 
its actions with any corresponding actions being taken under the Food 
Stamp program where the factual issue arise from the same or related 
circumstances.
    (b) Definition of intentional program violation. An intentional 
program violation is an action by an individual, for the purpose of 
establishing or maintaining the family's eligibility for AFDC or for 
increasing or preventing a reduction in the amount of the grant, which 
is intentionally:
    (1) A false or misleading statement or misrepresentation, 
concealment, or withholding of facts, or

[[Page 144]]

    (2) Any act intended to mislead, misrepresent, conceal, or withhold 
facts or propound a falsity.
    (c) Disqualification penalties. (1) An individual who, on the basis 
of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or otherwise, is found to have 
committed an intentional program violation by a State administrative 
disqualification hearing pursuant to this section or by a State or 
Federal court will be treated in the following manner. The State agency 
shall not take the individual's needs into account when determining the 
assistance unit's need and amount of the assistance. Any resources and 
income of the disqualified individual will be considered available to 
the assistance unit. The individual's needs will not be taken into 
account for 6 months upon the first occasion of any such offense; 12 
months upon the second occasion of any such offense; and permanently 
upon the third or a subsequent occasion of any such offense.
    (2) Duration of the penalty. Any period for which a disqualification 
penalty is imposed shall remain in effect, without possibility of an 
administrative stay, unless and until the finding upon which the penalty 
was based is subsequently reversed by a court of appropriate 
jurisdiction but in no event shall the duration of the period for which 
such penalty is imposed be subject to review.
    (3) Applicability of the penalty. A disqualification penalty imposed 
on an individual by one IV-A State agency may be used determining the 
appropriate disqualification penalty for the individual by another IV-A 
State agency. Where an individual with a prior violation(s) moves from 
one State to another and has been found to have committed an intentional 
program violation(s), the State agency may impose the penalty based on 
the number of such violations committed in other States. A State may 
establish interstate agreements with other States to share appropriate 
information.
    In cases where a disqualification penalty and other sanctions or 
penalties apply:
    (i) The disqualification penalties in this section shall be in 
addition to, and cannot be substituted for, any other sanctions or 
penalties which may be imposed by law for the same offenses; and
    (ii) The disqualification penalties imposed under this optional 
program only affect the individual concerned and cannot substitute for 
other sanctions under the AFDC program (e.g., failure to participate in 
JOBS or to cooperate in obtaining child support).
    (d) Notice requirements. The State agency must provide all 
applicants with a written notice of the disqualification penalties for 
fraud under this section at the time of application. Individuals who are 
recipients on the date of approval of the State plan amendment 
implementing this optional program must be provided a written notice no 
later than the next redetermination for AFDC.
    (e) State plan requirements and budget information. A State agency 
electing this optional program must operate such program in full 
compliance with section 416 of the Social Security Act and submit to the 
Department (with such revisions as may from time to time be necessary):
    (1) A description of its fraud control program, and
    (2) An initial budget estimate for the program.
    (f) Federal financial participation--(1) Allowable costs. Federal 
financial participation (FFP) is authorized at the 50 percent 
reimbursement rate to a State agency with an approved plan to establish 
and operate a fraud control program pursuant to section 416 of the 
Social Security Act. All costs must adhere to cost principles found at 
OMB Circular No. A-87 (available from the Executive Office of the 
President, Publications Unit, room 2200, New Executive Office Building, 
725 17th Street NW., Washington, DC 20503) and to cost allocation 
provisions found at Sec. 205.150 of this chapter.
    (2) Cost allocation. Where common activities or efforts are 
undertaken in support of both the AFDC and Food Stamp programs, the cost 
allocation plan pursuant to Sec. 205.150 of this chapter must provide 
for a distribution of these costs to both programs.

<R05>
Sec. 235.113  Disqualification hearing procedures under optional AFDC fraud control.

    (a) Pre-hearing investigation requirement. The State IV-A agency 
that had elected to establish and operate a fraud control program 
pursuant to section 416 of the Act must conduct an investigation of an 
allegation that an individual committed an intentional program 
violation.
    (b) Disqualification hearings. (1) The State agency may consolidate 
an individual's fair hearing governed by Sec. 205.10 with a 
disqualification hearing based on the same or related circumstances 
provided that the individual receives prior notice of the consolidation. 
Additionally, the State agency may designate the same hearing officer to 
preside at a consolidated hearing.
    (2) The State agency may provide administration disqualification 
hearings at the local level in some or all of its subdivisions with a 
right to appeal to a State agency level de novo hearing.
    (3)(i) The State agency shall provide a written notice to the 
individual alleged to have committed the program violation at least 30 
days prior to the date of the disqualification hearing.
    (ii) The advance written notice to the individual shall include the 
following items:
    (A) The date, time and location of the hearing;
    (B) The charge(s) against the individual;
    (C) A summary of the evidence, and how and where the evidence can be 
examined;
    (D) A warning that the individual's failure to appear without good 
cause will result in a decision by the hearing officer based solely on 
the information provided by the State agency at the hearing;
    (E) A statement that the individual may request a postponement of 
the hearing provided that such request is made to the State agency at 
least 10 days in advance of the scheduled hearing;
    (F) A statement that the individual will have 10 days from the date 
of the scheduled hearing to present to the State agency good cause for 
failure to appear in order to receive a new hearing;
    (G) A description of the penalties that can result from a 
determination that the individual has committed an intentional program 
violation and a statement of which penalty is applicable to the 
individual;
    (H) A statement that the hearing does not preclude the State 
government from prosecuting the individual for an intentional program 
violation in a civil or criminal court action, or from collecting and 
overpayment;
    (I) A listing of individuals or organizations that provide free 
legal representation to individuals alleged to have committed 
intentional program violations;
    (J) An explanation that the individual may waive his or her right to 
appear at an administrative disqualification hearing as provided in 
paragraph (c) below; and
    (K) A statement of the accused individual's right to remain silent 
concerning the charge(s) and that anything said or signed by the 
individual concerning the charge(s) may be used against him or her in a 
court of law.
    (4) The State agency will require the hearing officer to postpone 
the scheduled hearing at the individual's request provided that the 
request for postponement is made at least 10 days in advance of the date 
of the scheduled disqualification hearing. However, the hearing shall 
not be postponed for more than a total of 30 days, and the State agency 
may limit the number of postponements to one.
    (5) A hearing shall be conducted by an impartial official of the 
agency who has not had previous involvement in the case.
    (6) Medical assessments shall be obtained at agency expense and made 
part of the record if the hearing officer considers it necessary.
    (7) The individual, or his representative, shall have adequate 
opportunity to:
    (i) Examine the contents of his case file, and all documents and 
records to be used by the agency at the hearing, at a reasonable time 
before the date of the hearing, and during the hearing;
    (ii) Present his case himself or with the aid of an authorized 
representative;
    (iii) Bring witnesses;

[[Page 146]]

    (iv) Establish all pertinent facts and circumstances;
    (v) Advance any arguments without undue influence; and
    (vi) Question or refute any testimony or evidence, including the 
opportunity to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses.
    (8) Decisions made by the hearing officer shall be based exclusively 
on evidence and other material introduced at the hearing. The transcript 
or recording of testimony, exhibits, or official reports introduced at 
the hearing, together with all papers and requests filed in the 
proceeding, and the decision of the hearing officer shall be made 
available to the individual or to his or her representative at a 
reasonable time and place.
    (9) Decisions by the hearing officer shall:
    (i) In the event of an evidentiary hearing, consist of a decision 
memorandum summarizing the facts and identifying the regulations 
supporting the decision;
    (ii) In the event of a State agency de novo hearing, specify the 
reasons for the decision and identify the supporting evidence and 
regulations; and
    (iii) Be made within 90 days of the date of the notice.
    (10) The State agency may not disqualify an individual until the 
hearing officer finds that the individual has committed an intentional 
program violation. This does not mean, however, that the State agency is 
precluded from discontinuing, terminating, suspending, or reducing 
assistance, or changing the manner or form of payment to a protective, 
vendor, or two-party payment for other reasons. For example, in a State 
that requires monthly reporting, the State agency may have facts which 
substantiate that the unit failed to report a change in circumstances 
even though the State agency has not yet demonstrated that the failure 
to report was an intentional program violation.
    (11) If the hearing officer finds that the individual committed an 
intentional program violation, the State agency shall provide a written 
notice to the individual prior to disqualification. The notice shall 
inform the individual of the decision and the reason for the decision. 
In addition, the notice shall inform the individual of the period of 
disqualification (which shall begin no later than the first day of the 
second month which follows the date of notice), and the amount of 
payment the unit will receive during the disqualification period, and in 
cases of an individual's disqualification resulting from a prior receipt 
of assistance, the disqualification will be postponed until after a 
reapplication for AFDC assistance is approved.
    (12) If a hearing officer at a local level disqualification hearing 
determines that an individual committed an intentional program 
violation, the notice of the local level hearing decision shall, in 
addition to the items described in paragraph (b)(11) of this section, 
inform the individual of the right to appeal the decision to the State 
agency within 15 days of the date of the notice.
    (c) Waiver of the administrative disqualification hearing. (1) Each 
State agency may establish procedures to allow an accused individual to 
waive his or her right to appear at an administrative disqualification 
hearing.
    (2) For State agencies that elect the option of allowing individuals 
to waive their rights to appear at an administrative disqualification 
hearing, the following procedures are required:
    (i) The advance notice in paragraph (b)(3) of this section must 
include a statement that the individual may waive the right to appear at 
an administrative disqualification hearing.
    (ii) This statement shall include, at a minimum:
    (A) The date that the signed waiver must be received by the State 
agency and a signature block for the accused individual, along with a 
statement that the caretaker relative must also sign the waiver if the 
accused individual is not the caretaker relative, with an appropriately 
designated signature block;
    (B) A statement of the accused individual's right to remain silent 
concerning the charge(s) and that anything said or signed by the 
individual concerning the charge(s) may be used against him or her in a 
court of law;

[[Page 147]]

    (C) The fact that waiver of the individual's right to appear at a 
disqualification hearing may result in a disqualification penalty and a 
reduction in the assistance payment for the appropriate period even if 
the accused individual does not admit to the facts as presented by the 
State agency; and
    (D) An opportunity for the accused individual to specify whether or 
not he or she admits to the facts as presented by the State agency.
    (3) When the individual waives his or her right to appear at a 
disqualification hearing, the disqualification and appropriate reduction 
of assistance shall result regardless of whether the individual admits 
or denies the charges. The State agency shall send a written notice 
informing the individual of the period of disqualification (which shall 
begin no later than the first day of the second month which follows the 
date of notice), and the amount of payment the unit will receive during 
the disqualification period. If an individual whose case has been 
terminated waives his disqualification hearing rights, the 
disqualification period shall be postponed until after a reapplication 
for AFDC assistance is approved.
    (d) Court actions on consent agreements. (1) Each State agency may 
establish procedures to allow an accused individual to sign an agreement 
confirmed by a court in which he or she admits committing an intentional 
program violation.
    (2) State agencies that allow an individual to sign such an 
agreement shall follow these procedures:
    (i) The State agency shall enter into an agreement with its Attorney 
General's Office or, where necessary, with county prosecutors which 
provides for advance written notification to the accused individual of 
the consequences of signing such an agreement. The written notification 
shall include, at a minimum:
    (A) A statement for the accused individual to sign that he or she 
understands the consequences of signing the agreement, along with a 
statement that the caretaker relative must also sign the agreement if 
the accused individual is not the caretaker relative;
    (B) A statement that signing the agreement will result in a 
reduction in payment for the appropriate period; and
    (C) A statement of which disqualification period will be imposed as 
a result of the accused individual signing the agreement.
    (ii) After the court confirms the agreement, the State agency shall 
provide a written notice to the individual which specifies the period of 
disqualification (which shall begin no later than the first day of the 
second month which follows the date of notice), and the amount of 
payment the unit will receive during the disqualification period. 
However, if the court specifies the date for initiating the 
disqualification period, the State agency shall disqualify the accused 
individual in accordance with the court order. If an individual whose 
case has been terminated signs a consent agreement, the disqualification 
period shall be postponed until after a reapplication for AFDC 
assistance is approved.

PART 237--FISCAL ADMINISTRATION OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS--Table of Contents

<R05>


    Authority:  Section 1102 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 
1302); 49 Stat. 647, as amended.


<R05>
Sec. 237.50  Recipient count, Federal financial participation.

    Pursuant to the formulas in sections 3, 403, 1003, 1118, 1121, 1403, 
and 1603 of the Social Security Act, it is necessary to identify 
expenditures that may be included in claims for Federal financial 
participation. The quarterly statement of expenditures and recoveries 
which is required for OAA, AFDC, AB, APTD, and AABD must include, as a 
part of the basis for computing the amount of Federal participation in 
such expenditures, the number of eligible recipients each month. 
However, where the State is making claims under section 1118 of the Act 
or under optional provisions for Federal sharing specified in such 
paragraphs no recipient count is involved. Vendor payments for medical 
care may not be considered if the State has a plan approved under title 
XIX of

[[Page 148]]

the Act. The procedures for determining recipient count are set forth in 
paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section.
    (a) Adult assistance categories. For each adult assistance category, 
under title I, X, XIV, or XVI, of the Act, the recipient count for any 
month may include:

    (1) Eligible recipients who receive money payments or in whose 
behalf protective payments are made for that month:

Provided, That such payments are not excluded from Federal financial 
participation under the provisions of Sec. 233.145(c) of this chapter; 
plus
    (2) Other eligible recipients in whose behalf payments are made for 
institutional services in intermediate care facilities for that month, 
but only in a State which does not have in effect a plan approved under 
Title XIX of the Act. (See Sec. 233.145(b)(2) of this chapter.)

    (b) AFDC category. For the AFDC category under title IV, part A, of 
the Act:
    (1) The recipient count for any month includes:
    (i) Eligible recipients in families which receive a money payment, 
plus
    (ii) Eligible recipients in families not otherwise counted on whose 
behalf protective or nonmedical vendor assistance payments are made for 
such month in accordance with the vendor payment provisions at 
Sec. 234.60, provided that such payments are not excluded from Federal 
financial participation under the provisions of Sec. 233.145(c) of this 
chapter.
    (2) For the purpose of this provision, recipients means, if 
otherwise eligible:
    (i) Children;
    (ii) In a home with no parent who is the caretaker relative, an 
otherwise eligible relative of specified degree;
    (iii) Parent(s);
    (iv) The spouse of such parent, in the case of AFDC eligibility due 
to incapacity or unemployment;
    (3) As used in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, the term 
parent means the natural or adoptive parent, or the stepparent who is 
married to the child's natural or adoptive parent and is legally 
obligated to support the child under a State law of general 
applicability which requires stepparents to support stepchildren to the 
same extent that natural or adoptive parents are required to support 
their children; and the term ``spouse'' as used in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) 
of this section means an individual who is the husband or wife of the 
child's own parent, as defined above, by reason of a legal marriage as 
defined under State law.
    (4) Where there are two or more dependent children living in a place 
of residence with two other persons and each of such other persons is a 
relative who has responsibility for the care and control of one or more 
of the dependent children, there may be two AFDC families (assistance 
units), if neither family includes a parent or sibling included in the 
other family pursuant to Sec. 206.10 (a)(1)(vii).
    (c) Essential person. An essential person or other ineligible person 
who is living with the eligible person may not be counted as a 
recipient.

<R04>
                   Subpart A--Purpose and Definitions


<R05>
Sec. 250.0  Purpose.

    (a) The purpose of the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training 
(JOBS) program under titles IV-A and IV-F of the Social Security Act is 
to assure that needy families with children obtain the education, 
training and employment that will help avoid long-term welfare 
dependence. To accomplish this purpose, the JOBS program is intended to;
    (1) Encourage, assist, and require applicants for and recipients of 
AFDC to fulfill their responsibilities to support their children by 
preparing for, accepting, and retaining employment;
    (2) Provide individuals with the opportunity to acquire the 
education and skills necessary to qualify for employment;
    (3) Provide necessary supportive services, including transitional 
child care and medical assistance, so that individuals can participate 
in JOBS and accept employment;
    (4) Promote coordination of services at all levels of government in 
order to make a wide range of services available, especially for 
individuals at risk of long-term welfare dependency, and to maximize the 
use of existing resources; and
    (5) Emphasize accountability for both participants and service 
providers.
    (b) This part provides that a State IV-A agency, as a condition of 
participation in the AFDC program, must operate a JOBS program. In 
addition, these regulations require that States provide child care and 
other supportive services for participants in the JOBS program, as well 
as certain other individuals, pursuant to parts 255 and 256. This part 
contains the policies, rules and regulations pertaining to the Job 
Opportunities and Basic Skills Training (JOBS) program.

[[Page 150]]

    (c) This part is applicable to States with approved JOBS programs 
pursuant to Sec. 250.20, and to all States as of October 1, 1990.


<R05>
Sec. 250.1  Definitions.

    Except to the extent otherwise specified in this section, terms used 
in part 250 shall have the same meaning otherwise applicable to the Aid 
to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program.

    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2), JOBS activities which 
involve decision-making with regard to individual participants may be 
performed by an entity other than the State IV-A agency according to the 
policies, rules, and regulations of the State IV-A agency. In doing so, 
such entity must not have the authority to review, change, or disapprove 
any administrative decision of the State IV-A agency, or otherwise 
substitute its judgment for that of the State IV-A agency as to the

Sec. 250.11  Requirement for a statewide program.

    (a) Not later than October 1, 1992 the State must make the JOBS 
program available on a statewide basis. This means that the JOBS 
program, including all components described in Sec. 250.44 and two of 
the components in Sec. 250.45, must be available in each political 
subdivision of the State, unless the State determines that it is not 
feasible to do so.
    (b) Although all required and at least two optional components, as 
described in Secs. 250.44 and 250.45, must be included in a State JOBS 
program, the components need not be operated in the same manner in each 
political subdivision, nor must the State operate the same optional 
components, as listed in Sec. 250.45, in each political subdivision.
    (c)(1) If the State IV-A agency concludes that a statewide program 
is not feasible, appropriate justification must be submitted to the 
Secretary for review and approval as part of its JOBS plan, unless the 
following criteria are met:
    (i) A minimal JOBS program is available in a number of political 
subdivisions in which 95 percent of the State's adult recipients reside; 
and
    (ii) A complete JOBS program is available in all Metropolitan 
Statistical Areas in the State, and in a number of political 
subdivisions in which 75 percent of the State's adult recipients reside.
    (iii) A minimal program includes high school or equivalent 
education, as specified in Sec. 250.44, one optional component from 
among those specified at Sec. 250.45, and information and referral to 
available non-JOBS employment services. A complete program includes all 
mandatory components as well as any two optional components.
    (iv) In determining the percentages of adult recipients residing in 
political subdivisions of a State, for purposes of this section, adult 
members of Indian Tribes and Alaska Native organizations who reside 
within the service area of a Tribal JOBS program, pursuant to 
Sec. 250.90, will not be counted.
    (2) The justification must include the following:
    (i) The number of adult recipients that would be excluded and a 
comparison of:
    (A) The estimated average annual unit cost per participant were the 
JOBS program extended to excluded areas with
    (B) The estimated average annual unit cost per JOBS participant in 
the included areas;
    (ii) A description of the local economic conditions that make 
operation of the program in such areas infeasible; and
    (iii) Whether the State expects to expend all of its limit of 
entitlement, pursuant to Sec. 250.70, for the period covered by the JOBS 
plan.


<R05>
Sec. 250.12  Coordination and consultation.

    State IV-A agencies are required to assure coordination of JOBS 
program services, including child care and supportive services pursuant 
to Sec. 255.3(h) of the regulations, with related services provided by 
other agencies.
    (a) The Governor shall assure that JOBS program activities are 
coordinated with programs under the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) 
and with any other relevant employment, training, and education programs 
available within the State. At a minimum, this means that the 
appropriate job training and preparation components of the State JOBS 
plan shall be consistent with the coordination criteria specified in the 
Governor's coordination and special services plan required under section 
121 of the JTPA.

[[Page 153]]

    (b) In developing the JOBS plan and carrying out the JOBS program, 
including the supportive services provisions, the State IV-A agency must 
consult and coordinate with other providers, including those specified 
in paragraph (c) of this section, to identify existing resources to 
prevent duplication of services, assure that other program services are 
available to enable participants to achieve self-sufficiency, and assure 
that costs for these other services for which welfare recipients have 
been eligible are not incurred by the JOBS program pursuant to 
Sec. 250.72.
    (c) At a minimum, the State IV-A agency must consult and coordinate 
with:
    (1) The State agency responsible for JTPA;
    (2) The State agency responsible for the Employment Service;
    (3) The State education agency for programs under the Adult 
Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1201 et seq.) and Carl D. Perkins Vocational 
Education Act (20 U.S.C. 2301 et seq.);
    (4) The State agencies responsible for child care activities as 
described in Sec. 255.3(h); and
    (5) The State agencies responsible for public housing.
    (d) The State IV-A agency and local welfare agencies, as 
appropriate, must consult with the private industry councils (as 
established under section 102 of the JTPA):
    (1) On the development of arrangements and contracts under JOBS, as 
described in Sec. 250.13, and under the JTPA; and
    (2) To identify and obtain advice on the types of jobs available, or 
likely to become available, in the area. The State IV-A agency must 
ensure that JOBS provides training for the types of jobs which are, or 
are likely to become, available in the area, and that resources are not 
expended on training for jobs that are not likely to become available.
    (e) The State IV-A agency must exchange information with an eligible 
Indian Tribe or Alaska Native organization which submitted an 
application to the Department by April 13, 1989 to operate a separate 
JOBS program under Sec. 250.91.
    (1) This information includes available data on adult Tribal or 
Alaska Native organization AFDC recipients necessary to determine a 
Tribe or organization's JOBS funding level and designated service area, 
as appropriate, as described in Sec. 250.93(b). State and Tribal and 
Alaska Native organization representatives receiving such AFDC recipient 
data must follow comparable standards of confidentiality as described in 
Sec. 250.93(b).
    (2) Since the State IV-A agency maintains responsibility for 
providing basic AFDC program services, such as eligibility 
notifications, and child care funds or services to participants in a 
Tribal JOBS program, the State and such grantee must coordinate 
interrelated activities as described in Sec. 250.94(a) and part 255.


<R05>
Sec. 250.13  Contracting authority.

    The State IV-A agency shall carry out the JOBS program directly or 
through arrangements or under contracts with administrative entities 
under section 4(2) of the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA), with 
State and local educational agencies, and with other public agencies, 
Indian Tribes or Alaska Native organizations or private organizations 
(including community-based organizations as defined in section 4(5) of 
the JTPA).
    (a) Arrangements and contracts entered into under this section may 
cover any service or activity (including outreach, information and 
referral) to be made available under the JOBS program. Such contracted 
service or activity must be consistent with the requirements under 
Sec. 250.10 and must not otherwise be available on a nonreimbursable 
basis, as specified in Sec. 250.72(c).
    (b) The State IV-A agency must consult with the private industry 
councils on the development of arrangements and contracts under JOBS 
pursuant to Sec. 250.12.
    (c) In selecting service providers, the State IV-A agency must take 
into account appropriate factors which may include past performance in 
providing similar services, demonstrated effectiveness, fiscal 
accountability, cost efficiency, ability to meet performance standards, 
and such other factors as

[[Page 154]]

the State IV-A agency may determine to be appropriate.
    (d) For purposes of claiming FFP, the State IV-A agency must 
segregate costs by the applicable matching rates, as defined at 
Sec. 250.73(b)(1), in any arrangement or contract entered into under 
this section.
    (e) Services contracted under JOBS are subject to the requirements 
of part 92, excluding the provisions at Sec. 92.30(d)(4).

<R04>
     Subpart D--Participation Requirements, Exemptions and Sanctions


<R05>
Sec. 250.30  Requirements for individual participation and exemptions.

    A State JOBS plan must provide that:
    (a) Where State resources otherwise permit, all recipients of AFDC 
who live in a subdivision covered by a JOBS program and for whom the 
State IV-A agency has guaranteed child care in accordance with part 255 
shall be required to participate in JOBS except as provided under 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) An individual shall be considered exempt and not be required to 
participate if she:
    (1) Is a child who--
    (i) Is under age 16, or
    (ii) Attends, full-time, an elementary, secondary, vocational or 
technical school (except that such school attendance as a required JOBS 
activity for a child who loses this exemption will not requalify the 
child for the exemption);
    (2) Is ill, when determined by the State on the basis of medical 
evidence or another sound basis that the illness or injury is serious 
enough to temporarily prevent entry into employment or training;
    (3) Is incapacitated, when verified by the State that a physical or 
mental impairment, determined by a physician or a licensed or certified 
psychologist, prevents the individual from engaging in employment or 
training under JOBS. This may include a period of recuperation after 
childbirth if prescribed by a woman's physician;
    (4) Is 60 years of age or older;
    (5) Resides in a subdivision of the State where the JOBS program is 
available, but in a location which is so remote from a JOBS program or 
activity that effective participation is precluded. The individual shall 
be considered remote if a round trip of more than 2 hours by reasonably 
available public or private transportation, exclusive of time necessary 
to transport children to and from a child care facility, would be 
required for a normal work or training day. However, if normal round 
trip commuting time in the area is more than 2 hours, then the round 
trip commuting time shall not exceed the generally accepted community 
standards;
    (6) Is needed in the home because another member of the household 
requires the individual's presence due to illness or incapacity as 
determined by a physician or a licensed or certified psychologist, and 
no other appropriate member of the household is available to provide the 
needed care;
    (7) Is working 30 or more hours a week. The State IV-A agency may 
establish minimum standards in its JOBS plan for work that qualifies an 
individual for this exemption;
    (8) Is pregnant, and it has been medically verified that the child 
is expected to be born in the month in which participation would be 
required or within the following six-month period;
    (9)(i) Subject to paragraph (b)(9)(iv), is the parent or other 
relative of a child under 3 years of age (or an age less than 3 but not 
less than 1, if the State plan so provides) who is personally providing 
care for the child; or
    (ii) Subject to paragraph (b)(9)(iv), is the parent or other 
relative personally providing care for a child under 6 years of age, 
unless the State IV-A agency assures that child care will be guaranteed 
and that participation in the program by the parent or relative will not 
be required for more than 20 hours per week.
    (iii) Only one parent or other relative in a case may be exempt 
under paragraph (b)(9)(i) or paragraph (b)(9)(ii) of this section.
    (iv) In the case of a family eligible for AFDC by reason of the 
unemployment of the parent who is the principal earner, only one parent 
may be exempt under paragraph (b)(9)(i) or paragraph (b)(9)(ii) of this 
section. The State IV-A agency may:
    (A) Limit the exemptions in paragraph (b)(9)(i) and paragraph 
(b)(9)(ii)

[[Page 159]]

of this section to the parent who is not the principal earner;
    (B) Make the exemptions in paragraph (b)(9)(i) and paragraph 
(b)(9)(ii) of this section inapplicable to both parents and require 
their participation in the program if child care in accordance with part 
255 is guaranteed with respect to the family; or
    (10) Is a full-time volunteer serving under the Volunteers In 
Service To America (VISTA) program, pursuant to title I of the Domestic 
Volunteer Service Act of 1973;
    (c)(1) The State IV-A agency shall reevaluate any exemption at such 
time as the condition is expected to terminate but no less frequently 
than at each redetermination of AFDC eligibility;
    (2) The State IV-A agency shall promptly notify the recipient and 
any appropriate service providers of any change in the recipient's 
exemption status.


<R05>
Sec. 250.31  Volunteers.

    The State IV-A agency must provide that applicants for and 
recipients of AFDC who are exempt under Sec. 250.30 from participation 
in the program or who are not otherwise required by the State IV-A 
agency to participate will be allowed to do so on a voluntary basis to 
the extent that the program is available in the applicable political 
subdivision and State resources otherwise permit.
    (a) The State IV-A agency shall give first consideration to 
applicants for or recipients of AFDC who volunteer to participate in 
determining the priority of participation within the target populations 
described at Sec. 250.1.
    (b) When an individual who volunteers to participate stops 
participating in the program without good cause as defined at 
Sec. 250.35,
    (1) If she has been determined to be exempt pursuant to Sec. 250.30, 
she shall not be given priority to participate so long as other 
individuals are actively seeking to participate.
    (2) If she has been determined not to be exempt pursuant to 
Sec. 250.30, she shall be subject to sanction as described at 
Sec. 250.34.


<R05>
Sec. 250.32  Participation requirements for education.

    (a) To the extent that the program is available in the political 
subdivision involved and State resources otherwise permit, in the case 
of a custodial parent who is not yet 20 years of age, has not completed 
a high school education (or its equivalent) and is not exempt from 
participation under Sec. 250.30(b), the State shall require such a 
parent to participate in educational activities as described in 
Sec. 250.44(a)(1). For purposes of this section, custodial parent means 
the parent who lives with the child, including custodial parents who 
would otherwise be exempt under Sec. 250.30(b)(9) because of the age of 
the youngest child.
    (1) The State IV-A agency may require full-time participation (as 
defined by the educational provider) in educational activities directed 
toward the attainment of a high school diploma or its equivalent. This 
includes individuals who would otherwise only have to participate on a 
part-time basis because their youngest child is under 6 years of age.
    (2) The State IV-A agency may excuse a custodial parent who is under 
age 18 from the school attendance requirement if such parent is 
determined to be beyond the State's compulsory attendance requirements 
and if the State's JOBS plan contains criteria for making this 
determination. The State's criteria must:
    (i) Provide that each determination is based upon an individual 
assessment of the parent rather than upon the application of categorical 
exemptions;
    (ii) Not rely solely upon grade completion; and
    (iii) Provide for participation in another educational activity as 
defined under Sec. 250.44(a) or in skills training activities under 
Sec. 250.44(b) that are combined with education.
    (3) The State IV-A agency may require a custodial parent who is age 
18 or 19, and required to participate in JOBS under this section, to 
participate in training or work activities (subject to the 20-hour limit 
in Sec. 250.30(b)(9)(ii)) instead of educational activities described at 
Sec. 250.44(a) if one of the following conditions is met:

[[Page 160]]

    (i) Such parent fails to make good progress in successfully 
completing educational activities, or
    (ii) Prior to any assignment of the individual to such educational 
activities it is determined, based on an educational assessment and the 
employment goal established in the individual's employability plan, that 
participation in educational activities is inappropriate for such 
parent.
    (b) If a State IV-A agency requires an individual who has attained 
the age of 20 years and has not earned a high school diploma (or its 
equivalent) to participate in JOBS, the State agency shall include 
educational activities consistent with her employment goals as a 
component in the individual's employability plan. Any other services or 
activities may not be permitted to interfere with her participation in 
appropriate educational activities under Sec. 250.44. However, a State 
IV-A agency may elect not to require an individual to participate in 
educational activities if:
    (1) The individual demonstrates a basic literacy level; or
    (2) The long-term employment goal of the individual, as identified 
by the State IV-A agency in her employability plan, does not require a 
high school diploma (or equivalent).


<R05>
Sec. 250.33  Participation requirements for unemployed parents.

    (a) The State IV-A agency shall require that at least one parent, in 
any family eligible for AFDC by reason of the unemployment of the parent 
who is the principal earner, participate for a total of at least l6 
hours a week in a work supplementation program, a community work 
experience program, or other work experience program, on-the-job 
training, or a State-designed work program described in the State JOBS 
plan and approved by the Secretary. A State-designed work program may 
not substitute education or training activities for the work 
requirement.
    (b) In the case of a parent under age 25 who has not completed high 
school or an equivalent course of education, the State IV-A agency may 
require the individual to participate in educational activities as 
defined at Sec. 250.44(a) in lieu of one or more of the programs 
specified in paragraph (a). An individual meets the participation 
requirements of this section if he or she is making satisfactory 
progress as defined at Sec. 250.1.
    (c) An individual participating in a community work experience 
program under Sec. 250.63 shall be considered to have met the 
participation requirement in paragraph (a) if the individual 
participates for the maximum number of hours in any month calculated in 
accordance with Sec. 250.63(d)(1).


<R05>
Sec. 250.34  Sanctions.

    (a)(1) When an AFDC recipient who is required to participate in the 
JOBS program, including those individuals required to participate 
because the State IV-A agency exercised its option under 
Sec. 250.30(b)(9)(iii), fails to comply (i.e., fails without good cause 
to participate in the program, refuses without good cause to accept 
employment, or terminates employment or reduces earnings without good 
cause), the sanctions in paragraph (c) of this section shall apply 
during the following periods:
    (i) For the first such failure to comply, until the failure to 
comply ceases;
    (ii) For the second such failure to comply, until the failure to 
comply ceases, or 3 months, whichever is longer; and
    (iii) For any subsequent failure to comply, until the failure to 
comply ceases, or 6 months, whichever is longer.
    (2) Failure to participate in the program includes failure to meet 
State IV-A agency requirements for orientation, assessment, 
employability development planning, or case management.
    (b) For the purpose of determining that an individual's failure to 
comply has ceased, a State IV-A agency may require the individual to 
participate in the activity to which she was previously assigned or an 
activity designed by the State to lead to full participation for a 
period of up to two weeks before terminating the sanction. During such 
participation, the individual shall be eligible for child care and 
support services which the State determines are necessary for 
participation. If she successfully participates in such

[[Page 161]]

activities, the sanction will be considered to have terminated as of the 
day she agreed to participate. If no such activity is available, the 
sanction will terminate on the day she agrees to participate.
    (c) During the sanction period:
    (1) The State IV-A agency will not take into account the 
individual's needs in determining the family's need for assistance and 
the amount of the assistance payment.
    (2) If the individual is a parent whose family is eligible in 
accordance with Sec. 233.100, the State IV-A agency will not take into 
account the needs of the second parent in determining the family's need 
for assistance and the amount of the assistance payment unless the 
second parent is participating in the JOBS program.
    (3) If the individual is the only dependent child, the State IV-A 
agency will not take into account the individual's needs in determining 
the family's need for assistance and the amount of the assistance 
payment.
    (d) If such individual is a parent or other caretaker relative, 
payments for the remaining members of the assistance unit will be in the 
form of protective or vendor payments in accordance with 
Sec. 234.60(a)(12). However, if after making reasonable efforts the 
State IV-A agency is unable to locate an appropriate individual to whom 
protective payments can be made, the State may continue to make payments 
on behalf of the remaining members of the assistance unit to the 
sanctioned caretaker relative.
    (e) The State IV-A agency will promptly remind in writing any 
individual whose failure or refusal has continued for 3 months of the 
individual's option to end the sanction. The notice shall advise that:
    (1) She may immediately terminate the first or second sanction by 
participating in the program or accepting employment; and
    (2) She may terminate any subsequent sanction after six months have 
elapsed by participating in the program or accepting employment.


<R05>
Sec. 250.35  Good cause.

    For the purposes of Sec. 250.34(a), good cause for failure to 
participate in the program or refusal to accept employment shall be 
found if:
    (a) The individual is the parent or other relative personally 
providing care for a child under age 6 and the employment would require 
such individual to work more than 20 hours per week;
    (b) Child care (or day care for any incapacitated individual living 
in the same home as a dependent child) is necessary for an individual to 
participate or continue participation in the program or accept 
employment and such care is not available and the State agency fails to 
provide such care;
    (c)(1) The employment would result in the family of the participant 
experiencing a net loss of cash income. A participant may not claim good 
cause under this paragraph if the State IV-A agency assures that the 
family will not experience a net loss of cash income by making a 
supplemental payment;
    (2) Net loss of cash income results if the family's gross income 
less necessary work-related expenses is less than the cash assistance 
the individual was receiving at the time the offer of employment is 
made. Gross income includes, but is not limited to, earnings, unearned 
income and cash assistance; or
    (d) The individual meets other grounds for good cause set forth by 
the State IV-A agency in its JOBS plan. At a minimum, the State must 
describe what circumstances beyond the household's control will 
constitute ``good cause.''


<R05>
Sec. 250.36  Conciliation and fair hearings.

    (a) Each State IV-A agency shall establish a conciliation procedure 
to resolve disputes related to an individual's participation in the JOBS 
Program.
    (b) Once conciliation ends and the notice of adverse action has been 
issued, the individual may contest the proposed sanction. If she 
contests and loses, or does not contest, then a sanction will be imposed 
for the appropriate time period.
    (c) If a dispute is not resolved through conciliation, the State 
shall provide the individual with an opportunity for a hearing. The 
hearing process may follow the provisions of

[[Page 162]]

Sec. 205.10. Alternatively, the hearing process may be established for 
the JOBS program. However, assistance may not be suspended, reduced, 
discontinued, or terminated as a result of a dispute involving an 
individual's participation in JOBS unless the hearing meets the due 
process standards set forth by the U.S. Supreme Court in Goldberg v. 
Kelly, 397 U.S. 254 (1970).


<R04>
     Subpart E--Operation of State JOBS Programs/Program Components


<R05>
Sec. 250.40  Providing program information to AFDC applicants and recipients.

    (a) The State IV-A agency must at the time of application or 
redetermination inform all AFDC applicants and recipients, in writing 
and orally as appropriate, of the availability of the program activities 
and the supportive services for which they are eligible, and agency and 
participant responsibilities, including:
    (1) Education, employment, and training opportunities available 
under the JOBS plan;
    (2) Supportive services, including, but not limited to, child care 
during participation, transitional child care, health coverage 
transition options pursuant to section 1925 of the Act, and 
transportation and other work-related supportive services provided under 
the JOBS plan;
    (3) The obligations of the State IV-A agency including the program 
and supportive services to be provided, as described in paragraphs (a) 
(1) and (2) of this section;
    (4) The rights, responsibilities, and obligations of participants in 
the program, including but not limited to, the grounds for exemptions 
from participation and the consequences for refusing or failing to 
participate (including the effect on volunteers as described in 
Sec. 250.31);
    (5)(i) The types and locations of child care services reasonably 
accessible to participants in the program. Such information may be 
provided directly or through arrangement with others such as the 
appropriate human services or resource and referral agency;
    (ii) The assistance that is available to help participants select 
appropriate child care services; and
    (iii) The assistance available, on request, to help participants 
obtain child care services.
    (b) The agency must also inform applicants and recipients of their 
responsibility to cooperate in establishing paternity and enforcing 
child support obligations, as described in part 232, and must assist 
individuals in obtaining the paternity establishment and child support 
services for which they may be eligible.
    (c)(1) After the State IV-A agency gives an AFDC applicant the 
information described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the 
State IV-A agency must notify the individual, in writing, within one 
month of the determination of eligibility, of the opportunity to 
indicate her desire to participate in the program and provide a clear 
description of how to enter the program.
    (2) After the State IV-A agency gives an AFDC recipient the 
information described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the 
State IV-A agency must notify the individual, in writing, within one 
month of providing that information, of the opportunity to indicate her 
desire to participate in the program, and provide a clear description of 
how to enter the program.
    (3) The notification provision in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of 
this section does not prohibit the State IV-A agency from requiring non-
exempt recipients, or applicants in the case of job search, to 
participate in the JOBS program prior to the one-month notice.
    (4) If a non-exempt individual indicates a preference not to 
participate, in response to such notification under paragraphs (c)(1) or 
(c)(2) of this section, such a preference does not prevent the State IV-
A agency from otherwise requiring participation in JOBS.


<R05>
Sec. 250.41  Initial assessment and employability plan.

    (a)(1) Within a reasonable time period prior to participation the 
State IV-A agency must make an initial assessment of employability based 
on:
    (i) The individual's educational, child care, and other supportive 
services needs;

[[Page 163]]

    (ii) The individual's proficiencies, skills deficiencies, and prior 
work experience;
    (iii) A review of the family circumstances, which may include the 
needs of any child of the individual; and
    (iv) Other factors that the State IV-A agency determines are 
relevant in developing the employability plan, as described in paragraph 
(b) of this section.
    (2) The State IV-A agency may conduct the initial assessment through 
various methods such as interviews, testing, counseling and self-
assessment instruments.
    (b) On the basis of the assessment described in paragraph (a) of 
this section, the State IV-A agency must develop an employability plan

    (1) The employability plan must:
    (i) Contain an employment goal for the participant;
    (ii) Describe the services to be provided by the State IV-A agency, 
including child care and other supportive services pursuant to part 255;
    (iii) Describe the JOBS activities, as provided in subpart E of this 
part, that will be undertaken by the participant to achieve the 
employment goal; and
    (iv) Describe any other needs of the family, pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(1)(iii), that might be met by JOBS, such as participation by a child 
in drug education or in life skills planning sessions.
    (2) The employability plan shall take into account:
    (i) Available program resources;
    (ii) The participant's supportive services needs;
    (iii) The participant's skills level and aptitudes;
    (iv) Local employment opportunities; and
    (v) To the maximum extent possible the preferences of the 
participant.
    (3) The employability plan shall not be considered a contract.
    (4) Final approval of the plan rests with the State IV-A agency.


<R05>
Sec. 250.42  Agency-participant agreement.

    (a) Following the initial assessment and the development of the 
employability plan as described in Sec. 250.41, the State IV-A agency 
may require the participant (or the adult caretaker in the family of 
which the participant is a member) to negotiate and enter into an 
agreement with the State IV-A agency.
    (1) Such agreement should indicate at a minimum:
    (i) The purpose of the agreement;
    (ii) The participant's obligations under the program;
    (iii) The length of participation in the program, including the 
number of hours of participation per week; and
    (iv) The educational, training and employment activities, and the 
supportive services, including child care, to be provided by the agency 
during the period of participation.
    (2) If the State IV-A agency elects this option, it must give the 
participant such assistance as she may need to review and understand the 
agreement.
    (3) This agreement may be considered a contract between the State 
IV-A agency and the JOBS participant, pursuant to applicable State laws 
and regulations.
    (b) If the State IV-A agency elects to use agreements or contracts, 
it does not have to use them in all political subdivisions having JOBS 
programs. The State IV-A agency, however, must apply this provision to 
participants on an equitable basis.


<R05>
Sec. 250.43  Case management.

    (a) The State IV-A agency may assign a case manager to a participant 
and the participant's family. The decision to assign a case manager may 
be made on a case-by-case basis.
    (b) The case manager must be responsible for assisting the family to 
obtain any services that may be needed to assure effective participation 
in the program.


<R05>
Sec. 250.44  Mandatory components.

    A State's JOBS program must include the following four services and 
activities. The State IV-A agency need not make each service or activity 
a discrete offering, but may combine several into a single program 
activity,

[[Page 164]]

provided that the State IV-A agency can adequately distinguish the 
principal components for the purpose of Federal reporting requirements. 
The required services and activities are:
    (a) Any educational activity below the postsecondary level that the 
State IV-A agency determines to be appropriate to the participant's 
employment goal. Such activities may be combined with training that the 
State IV-A agency determines is needed in relation to the participant's 
employability plan. The educational activities that must be made 
available include, but are not limited to:
    (1) High school education or education designed to prepare a person 
to qualify for a high school equivalency certificate;
    (2) Basic and remedial education that will provide an individual 
with a basic literacy level, equivalent to at least grade 8.9; and
    (3) Education in English proficiency for an individual who is not 
sufficiently competent to understand, speak, read, or write the English 
language to allow employment commensurate with her employment goal;
    (b) Job skills training, which includes vocational training for a 
participant in technical job skills and equivalent knowledge and 
abilities in a specific occupational area;
    (c) Job readiness activities that help prepare participants for work 
by assuring that participants are familiar with general workplace 
expectations and exhibit work behavior and attitudes necessary to 
compete successfully in the labor market; and
    (d) Job development and job placement activity by the agency, in 
soliciting a public or private employer's unsubsidized job opening or in 
discovering such job openings, and the marketing of participants, and 
securing job interviews for participants.


<R05>
Sec. 250.45  Optional components.

    A State JOBS program must include, but is not limited to, at least 
two of the following four components:
    (a) Group and individual job search, as described in Sec. 250.60;
    (b) On-the-job training, as described in Sec. 250.61;
    (c) Work supplementation, as described in Sec. 250.62; and
    (d) Community work experience program, or other approved work

    A State's JOBS program may include referral of a participant to 
postsecondary education, as determined necessary to meet any individual 
goals that are directly related to obtaining useful employment in a 
recognized occupation, within limits established by the State IV-A 
agency and reflected in the State JOBS plan. In accordance with 
Sec. 233.20(a)(2)(v), the costs of such education, including tuition, 
books and fees, do not qualify for FFP as special needs.


<R05>
Sec. 250.47  Other education, training, and employment activities.

    (a) A State's JOBS program may include education, training, and 
employment activities other than those described in Secs. 250.44 through 
250.46, but which are included in the approved State JOBS plan.
    (b) In no event will a State program of public service employment be 
approved under JOBS. Public service employment is fully-subsidized 
employment in a public agency.


<R05>
Sec. 250.48  Self-initiated education or training.

    (a) The State IV-A agency may allow a parent or other caretaker 
relative or any dependent child in the family who is attending in good 
standing an institution of higher education (as defined in section 
481(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965), or a school or other entity 
offering a course of vocational or technical training, at the time she 
would otherwise commence participation in the JOBS program, to continue 
to attend. Vocational or technical training leads to useful employment 
in a recognized occupation. It includes postsecondary education, as 
defined in Sec. 250.1, that results in other than a baccalaureate or 
advanced degree, and such training offered by other entities such as 
public secondary schools and public and private entities that offer 
adult vocational education.

[[Page 165]]

    (1) Self-initiated activity qualifies as ``self-initiated education 
or training'' under this paragraph if:
    (i) The participant is attending at least half-time as defined by 
the institution;
    (ii) The participant is making satisfactory progress in such 
institution, school, or course;
    (iii) The course of study is consistent with the individual's 
employment goal; and
    (iv) The participant meets the State's criteria for determining the 
appropriateness of the self-initiated education or training.
    (2)(i) The State IV-A agency must conduct an assessment and develop 
an employability plan, as provided at Sec. 250.41, so that the State IV-
A agency may determine the appropriateness of the education or training 
in accordance with the criteria it has established.
    (ii) If the State IV-A agency approves the self-initiated education 
or training, any other JOBS activities in which such individual 
participates may not be permitted to interfere with the education or 
training activity. However, an individual may be required to accept 
employment after a review of her employability plan, if the State IV-A 
agency has informed her at the time it first approves the self-initiated 
activity that it could perform such a review and reassignment.
    (3) The costs of self-initiated education or training under this 
paragraph shall not constitute federally reimbursable expenses under 
JOBS.
    (4) A State IV-A agency may restrict postsecondary education or 
training in its State JOBS plan.
    (5) The costs of child care, transportation, and other supportive 
services necessary for approved self-initiated education or training 
under this paragraph are eligible for Federal reimbursement pursuant to 
Sec. 255.4.
    (b) If an individual in a JOBS area is enrolled in a self-initiated 
activity that does not meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this 
section, the State may approve such activity as a JOBS activity 
according to the regulations and State criteria applicable to JOBS 
component activities covered under Secs. 250.44 through 250.47. 
Eligibility for child care, transportation and other supportive services 
shall be in accordance with Sec. 255.2.

<R04>
          Subpart G--Optional Components of State JOBS Programs


<R05>
Sec. 250.60  Job search program.

    (a) A State IV-A agency may operate a job search program as a 
component of its JOBS program. A job search program may serve 
participants in either group or individual job-seeking activities.
    (1) Individual job search includes the provision of counseling, job-
seeking skills training, information dissemination and support on a one-
to-one basis.
    (2) Group job search includes the provision of counseling and 
training in a group setting where applicants or recipients are taught 
job-seeking skills, and may include a phone bank from which participants 
contact potential employers.
    (b) In addition to non-exempt recipients, a State IV-A agency may 
require an individual applying for AFDC to participate in a job search 
component unless she is exempt under Sec. 250.30(b).
    (c) A State IV-A agency may require an individual to participate in 
a job search component from the date she files an application for aid 
for an initial period of up to eight consecutive weeks. Following this 
initial period (which may extend beyond the date when eligibility is 
determined), the State IV-A agency may require additional participation 
in a job search component not in excess of eight weeks (or its 
equivalent) in any period of 12 consecutive months. The first such 
period of 12 consecutive months shall begin at any time following the 
close of the initial period.
    (1) A State IV-A agency may not delay the processing of an 
individual's application for aid because of her participation in job 
search.
    (2) In no event may an individual be required to participate in job 
search for more than 3 weeks before the State IV-A agency conducts an 
assessment as provided at Sec. 250.41. If the State IV-A agency 
determines based on the assessment that another JOBS activity is more 
appropriate, or is required by

[[Page 166]]

part 250, the State IV-A agency shall terminate the job search 
requirement.
    (d) Additional job search activities beyond those required in 
paragraph (c) may be required only as part of another educational, 
training, or employment component designed to improve the individual's 
employment prospects.
    (e) Job search by an individual under this section shall in no event 
be treated, for any purpose, as an activity under JOBS if the individual 
has participated in such job search for 4 months (or its equivalent) out 
of the preceding 12 months.


<R05>
Sec. 250.61  On-the-job training.

    (a) A State IV-A agency may operate an on-the-job training (OJT) 
program as a component of its JOBS program. Under OJT a participant is 
hired by a private or public employer and while engaged in productive 
work receives training that provides knowledge or skills essential to 
the full and adequate performance of that job. The State IV-A agency or 
its agent shall enter into a contract with the OJT employer to reimburse 
the employer for providing training and additional supervision to the 
participant.
    (b) Payments to an employer for on-the-job training shall not exceed 
an average of 50 percent of the wages paid by the employer to the 
participant during the period of such training.
    (c) A participant in OJT shall be compensated by the employer at the 
same rates, including benefits and periodic increases, as similarly 
situated employees or trainees and in accordance with applicable law, 
but in no event less than the higher of the Federal minimum wage or 
applicable State or local minimum wage law.
    (d) Wages paid to participants in OJT will be considered to be 
earned income for purposes of any provision.
    (e) If a participant in OJT becomes ineligible for AFDC pursuant to 
the rules applicable to earned income at Sec. 233.20, or pursuant to the 
100-hour rule at Sec. 233.100 in the case of a principal earner in an 
unemployed parent case, she shall remain a JOBS participant for the 
duration of the OJT and shall be eligible for supportive services under 
part 255 available to other JOBS participants similarly situated.
    (f) If the individual would have been eligible for transitional 
child care pursuant to part 256 at the time the ineligibility for AFDC 
occurred, she shall be eligible for transitional child care after the 
OJT ends for the number of months that remain in the 12-month period 
following the month in which she became ineligible for AFDC after OJT 
ended. As an alternative, the State IV-A agency may treat all child care 
provided after an individual in an OJT job loses eligibility for AFDC as 
transitional child care if the individual meets the requirements at part 
256.
    (g) The State IV-A agency must develop qualitative measures for 
making good or satisfactory progress, pursuant to Sec. 250.1, in order 
for OJT to qualify as a component activity under JOBS.


<R05>
Sec. 250.62  Work supplementation program.

    (a) A State IV-A agency may operate a work supplementation program 
as a component of its JOBS program. Under the work supplementation 
program, a State IV-A agency may use AFDC funds to develop and subsidize 
jobs for AFDC recipients as an alternative to aid.
    (b) A ``supplemented job'' is a job provided under this section to 
an eligible individual by the State or local agency administering the 
State IV-A plan or by any other employer for which all or part of the 
wages are paid by such State or local IV-A agency.
    (1) The State IV-A agency may use whatever means it determines 
appropriate to provide or to subsidize jobs for participants.
    (2) The State IV-A agency may provide or subsidize any type of job. 
It may determine the length of time the position is to be provided or 
subsidized, the amount of wages to be paid to the recipient, the amount 
of subsidy to be provided by the State or local IV-A agency, and the 
conditions of participation, except that no participant may be assigned 
to fill any established, unfilled position vacancy in accordance with 
section 484 of the Act.
    (c)(1) An eligible individual is an individual who is in a category 
which the State IV-A agency determines should be eligible to participate 
in the work supplementation program, and who

[[Page 167]]

would, at the time of placement in the supplemented job, be eligible for 
AFDC if the State IV-A agency did not have a work supplementation 
program in effect. For the purpose of this section, time of placement is 
defined as the date on which the State IV-A agency and the employer 
reach agreement on the terms of the placement and the specific 
individual to be placed.
    (2) The State may establish a work supplementation program as either 
a mandatory or voluntary program.
    (d) A State or local IV-A agency administering the State plan is not 
required to provide employee status to any eligible individual to whom 
it provides a job position or with respect to whom it subsidizes all or 
part of the wages paid to such individual by another entity under this 
program, nor is it required to provide that eligible individuals filling 
job positions provided by other entities under such program be provided 
employee status by such entity during the first 13 weeks in which they 
fill such position.
    (e) Participants in supplemented jobs will be paid wages which shall 
be considered to be earned income for purposes of any provision of law.
    (f) The State IV-A agency may elect to calculate the amount of an 
eligible individual's residual (direct AFDC) grant, if any, at the time 
of placement in the supplemented job and base the amount of the residual 
grant (the AFDC grant minus earnings and other countable income) for the 
duration of the individual's participation in the supplemented job (in 
whole or part) on that calculation. Such a policy is known as ``freezing 
the grant.'' If the individual becomes otherwise ineligible for AFDC 
benefits, the State IV-A agency may allow the individual to continue in 
the supplemented job and divert the AFDC grant to the wage pool, but the 
State IV-A agency shall not pay a residual grant to the individual.
    (g) At State option, individuals who hold supplemented jobs may be 
exempt from the retrospective budgeting requirements at part 233 and 
monthly reporting, and the amount of the aid which is payable to the 
family of any such individual for any month, or which would be so 
payable but for the individual's participation in a supplemented job, 
shall be determined on the basis of the income and other relevant 
circumstances in that month.
    (h) If an individual in a supplemented job would have been eligible 
for transitional child care pursuant to part 256 at the time the 
ineligibility for AFDC occurred, she shall be eligible for transitional 
child care after her supplemented job ends for the number of months that 
remain in the 12-month period following the month in which she became 
ineligible. In the alternative, the State IV-A agency may treat all 
child care provided after an individual in a supplemented job loses 
eligibility for AFDC as transitional child care if the individual meets 
the requirements at part 256.
    (i) A State IV-A agency may adjust the standard of need under the 
State IV-A plan as the State determines to be necessary and appropriate 
to carry out a work supplementation program. Such changes in the need 
standard may be made notwithstanding Sec. 233.20.
    (1) The standard of need in effect in those subdivisions of the 
State in which such program is in operation may be different from the 
need standard in effect in subdivisions in which such program is not 
available.
    (2) The standard of need for categories of recipients of aid may 
vary among such categories as the State IV-A agency determines to be 
appropriate on the basis of ability to participate in the work 
supplementation program.
    (3) A State IV-A agency may make further adjustments in the amount 
of aid paid under the title IV-A plan to different categories of 
recipients in order to offset increases in benefits from other 
government-provided, needs-related programs as the State IV-A agency 
deems necessary and appropriate to further the purpose of the work 
supplementation program.
    (j) A State IV-A agency may reduce or eliminate the amount of earned 
income to be disregarded from participation in a supplemented job.
    (k) Notwithstanding the time limitations on the $30 and one-third 
and the $30 disregard in Sec. 233.20(a)(11), a State IV-A agency may 
allow a participant employed in a supplemented job to receive the $30 
and one-third or the $30

[[Page 168]]

disregards for one or more of the first nine months of such employment.
    (l) Payments by the State IV-A agency to individuals or to entities 
providing jobs for recipients under the work supplementation program 
shall be expenditures incurred by the State IV-A agency for AFDC and 
shall not exceed the amount that would otherwise be payable under the 
title IV-A plan if the family of each individual employed in the program 
had received the maximum amount of aid payable to such a family with no 
income for a period of either 9 months or the length of the individual's 
employment in the program, whichever is less. (This amount is determined 
without regard to any adjustments made under paragraphs (i), (j), and 
(k), and for each month of participation, may be based upon the maximum 
amount that would otherwise have been payable for a month at the time of 
placement in the program).
    (m) A State IV-A agency may determine the amounts to be reserved and 
used for providing and subsidizing jobs under this section by using a 
sampling methodology. The State IV-A agency must describe its sampling 
methodology in its JOBS plan.


<R05>
Sec. 250.63  Community work experience program.

    (a) A State IV-A agency may operate a community work experience 
program (CWEP) as a component of its JOBS program. The purpose of CWEP 
is to improve the employability of individuals not otherwise able to 
obtain employment by providing work experience and training to assist 
them to move promptly into regular public or private employment.
    (b) The State IV-A agency shall provide coordination among a 
community work experience program, any program of job search, and the 
other employment-related activities under the JOBS program to insure 
that job placement will have priority over participation in CWEP, and 
that individuals eligible to participate in more than one program under 
JOBS are not denied AFDC on the grounds of failure to participate in one 
such program if they are actively and satisfactorily participating in 
another. The State IV-A agency may provide that part-time participation 
in more than one such program may be required where appropriate.
    (c) Community work experience programs shall be limited to projects 
which serve a useful public purpose in fields such as health, social 
service, environmental protection, education, urban and rural 
development and redevelopment, welfare, recreation, public facilities, 
public safety, and day care.
    (d)(1) The maximum number of hours that an individual may be 
required to work or undergo training (or both) in CWEP is the number of 
hours which would result from dividing the family's monthly grant amount 
by the greater of the Federal or the applicable State minimum wage.
    (2) The portion of a recipient's aid for which the State is 
reimbursed by a child support collection (except for the $50 pass-
through) shall be excluded in determining the maximum number of hours 
that she is required to work.
    (e) Nothing contained in this section shall be construed as 
authorizing the payment of AFDC as compensation for work performed, nor 
shall a participant be entitled to a salary or to any work or training 
expense provided under any other provision of law by reason of her 
participation in a CWEP program.
    (f) To the extent possible, a State IV-A agency shall take into 
account the prior training, experience and skills of a recipient in 
making appropriate work assignments.
    (1) After each six months of an individual's participation in a 
community work experience program and at the conclusion of each 
assignment under such a program the State IV-A agency must provide a 
reassessment and revision, as appropriate, of the individual's 
employability plan.
    (2) After an individual has been assigned to a position for a total 
of nine months, such individual may not be required to continue in that 
assignment unless the maximum number of hours of participation is no 
greater than the family's grant divided by the highest of:
    (i) The Federal minimum wage; or
    (ii) The applicable State minimum wage; or

[[Page 169]]

    (iii) The rate of pay for individuals employed in the same or 
similar occupations by the same employer at the same site.

The portion of a recipient's aid for which the State is reimbursed by a 
child support collection (not including the $50 pass-through) shall 
continue to be excluded in determining the number of hours that such 
individual may be required to work.
    (g) Participants in CWEP may perform work in the public interest 
(which otherwise meets the requirements of this section) for a Federal 
office or agency with its consent, and, notwithstanding 31 U.S.C. 1342, 
or any other provision of law, such agency may accept such services, but 
such participants shall not be considered to be Federal employees for 
any purpose.
    (h) Nothing in this section or in any State plan approved under 
Sec. 250.20 shall be construed to prevent a State IV-A agency from 
operating (on such terms and conditions and in such cases as the State 
IV-A agency may find to be necessary or appropriate) a community work 
experience program.
    (i) CWEP participants must not fill established, unfilled position 
vacancies in accordance with section 484 of the Act.
    (j) FFP is not available for:
    (1) Capital expenditures, depreciation or use allowances in 
connection with a CWEP;
    (2) The cost of making or acquiring materials or equipment in 
connection with participation in a project; or
    (3) The cost of supervision of participants.
    (k) The State IV-A agency may offer any other work experience 
program which is described in the JOBS plan and approved by the 
Secretary.
    (1) The program narrative for such a program should include a 
description of the potential sponsors, the type of activities, the hours 
or length of participation required, target group(s), and how the 
program is different from CWEP.
    (2) The limitations on FFP for CWEP in paragraph (j) apply to all 
State work experience programs.
    (3) Any other work experience program must meet the general program 
standards at section 484 of the Act.

                           Subpart H--Funding


<R05>
Sec. 250.70  JOBS allocation entitlement.

    (a) Federal matching for JOBS program expenditures is limited to a 
national total equal to the amounts established for each fiscal year in 
section 403(k)(3) of the Act.
    (b) A State IV-A agency with an approved JOBS plan shall be entitled 
to payments from this annual limit. The maximum annual payment for a 
State will be the sum of two amounts:
    (1) An amount equal to the State's WIN or WIN Demonstration 
allotment for fiscal year 1987; and
    (2) An amount allocated from the balance of the annual national 
limitation on the basis of each State's relative average monthly number 
of adult recipients as defined at Sec. 250.1.
    (c) In accordance with Sec. 92.23, JOBS funds allocated to a State 
IV-A agency for a given Federal fiscal year are for use during that 
fiscal year and must be obligated by the State no later than the end of 
the fiscal year. Carry forward of an unobligated balance of Federal 
funds to a succeeding Federal fiscal year is not permitted. An 
unobligated Federal fund balance at the close of a Federal fiscal year 
will be returned to the Federal government through the issuance of a 
negative grant award by the Department following receipt of the final 
quarterly expenditure report for the fiscal year.
    (d) A State must liquidate all obligations incurred under the title 
IV-F grant awards not later than one year after the end of the fiscal 
year for which the funds were awarded and obligated. The Federal share 
of unliquidated obligations will be returned to the Federal government.


<R05>
Sec. 250.71  Allotment of JOBS limit of entitlement.

    (a) For a State IV-A agency that implements JOBS in a quarter of a 
fiscal year prior to October 1, 1990, the State's allotment from its 
JOBS limit of entitlement for that period will be proportional to the 
number of such quarters that JOBS is operational in that State in that 
fiscal year.
    (b) An Indian Tribe or Alaska Native organization which receives the 
Secretary's approval to conduct a JOBS

[[Page 170]]

program shall receive a direct payment for operation of its JOBS 
program, without the requirement for a non-Federal share, pursuant to 
Sec. 250.93.
    (1) The amount of any such direct payment will be deducted from the 
amount of the State's allotment, and will be proportional to the Tribe's 
or organization's proportion of the State's adult AFDC recipient 
population, as established pursuant to Sec. 250.93.
    (2) The remaining allocation to a State IV-A agency shall be subject 
to the regulations governing FFP at Sec. 250.73.
    (c) The following rules apply to Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin 
Islands and American Samoa which are subject to the provisions of 
section 1108 of the Act:
    (1) The limitations on payments contained in section 1108 do not 
apply to a State's annual limit of entitlement for the JOBS program as 
described in Sec. 250.70(b).
    (2) The availability of FFP for child care under part 255 and the 
related appropriate FFP rates are described at Sec. 255.4(b)(2) and 
Sec. 255.4(g).
    (3) The availability of FFP for transitional child care under part 
256 and the related appropriate FFP rates are described at 
Sec. 256.4(b).


<R05>
Sec. 250.72  Maintenance of effort.

    (a) Federal JOBS funds shall not be used to supplant non-Federal 
funds for services and activities that promote the purposes of the JOBS 
program.
    (b) States must spend no less than the total of State and local 
expenditures incurred in fiscal year 1986 for training, employment and 
education programs which had a defined purpose of preventing welfare 
dependency or potential welfare dependency. This requirement includes 
State and local funds expended for title IV-A and title IV-C work 
programs, including expenditures on those programs which were unmatched, 
and other State and local funds expended for this purpose, with or 
without benefit of Federal matching funds. This requirement also applies 
to expenditures for supportive services, including child care, expended 
for this purpose. In determining that State and local fiscal year 
expenditures are no less than fiscal year 1986 expenditures, States may 
use total aggregate expenditures.
    (c) State IV-A agency contracts and arrangements may be made for 
services only to the extent that they are not otherwise available on a 
non-reimbursable basis. ``Not otherwise available'' here means that if 
the services are available to AFDC applicants and recipients by a 
provider, the provider must maintain that level of service before the 
State IV-A agency may contract for additional services of the same sort 
from that provider.
    (d) Any State IV-A agency arrangement or contract must contain a 
certification from the provider that the services being contracted for 
are not otherwise available from that provider on a non-reimbursable 
basis. Services provided on a ``non-reimbursable basis'' are those 
services that a State makes available to most eligible residents or to 
the low income population, including AFDC applicants and recipients.
    (e) A State IV-A agency directly providing JOBS component services 
must certify in the State JOBS plan that such services are not otherwise 
available on a non-reimbursable basis.


<R05>
Sec. 250.73  Matching rates.

    (a) From a State IV-A agency's total annual limit of entitlement, 
FFP is available at a rate of 90 percent for expenditures up to an 
amount equal to the State's WIN or WIN Demonstration allotment for 
fiscal year 1987. The State's match for this amount may be in cash or in 
kind fairly evaluated.
    (b)(1) FFP will be available for the balance of a State IV-A 
agency's limit of entitlement as follows:
    (i) At the higher of the State's Medicaid matching rate or 60 
percent for: personnel costs (salaries and benefits) for full-time staff 
working full-time in any capacity in the JOBS program; and all direct 
costs associated with providing JOBS program services to individuals, 
including assessment, development of the employability plan, case 
management, and JOBS component activities.
    (ii) At 50 percent for: indirect personnel costs which are excluded 
from JOBS matching at the FMAP rate (or 60%); non-personal services 
costs associated with these indirect personnel

[[Page 171]]

costs, including space, travel, utilities, equipment, and supplies; the 
costs of such items as JOBS program planning, monitoring, letting 
contracts, systems, title IV-F fair hearing activities, and other 
indirect costs of providing JOBS services and activities; and for 
transportation, work-related expenses, and work-related supportive 
services as provided under the requirements of part 255.
    (2) A State's match for these amounts must be in cash, not in kind.
    (c) The costs of services and activities purchased under contract by 
the State or local IV-A agency must be segregated according to the 
requirements of the FMAP rate with a floor of 60 percent and the 
requirements for 50 percent matching.
    (d) A State's share of JOBS expenditures may include public and 
private funds.
    (1) Public funds may be considered as the State's share in claiming 
FFP when the funds are:
    (i) Appropriated directly to the State or local agency, or 
transferred from another public agency (including Indian tribes) to the 
State or local agency and under its administrative control;
    (ii) Not used to match other Federal funds; and
    (iii) Not Federal funds, or are Federal funds authorized by Federal 
law to be used to match other Federal funds.
    (2) Funds donated from private sources may be considered as the 
State's share in claiming FFP when the funds are:
    (i) Transferred to the State or local agency and under its 
administrative control;
    (ii) Donated without any restriction which would require their use 
for assisting a particular individual or at particular facilities or 
institutions;
    (iii) Do not revert to the donor's facility or use.
    (e) If included in a State's JOBS and Supportive Services plans, FFP 
is available for JOBS activities and services provided for certain 
periods to an individual who has been a JOBS participant but who loses 
eligibility for AFDC. These activities and periods are:
    (1) Case management activities and supportive services for up to 90 
days from the date the individual loses eligibility for AFDC; and
    (2) JOBS component activities for the duration of the activity if 
funds for the activity are obligated or expended before the individual 
loses eligibility for AFDC.


<R05>
Sec. 250.74  Reduced matching rate.

    (a)(1) FFP for a State IV-A agency shall be 50 percent (rather than 
the rates described in Sec. 250.73) in any fiscal year in which that 
State spends less than 55 percent of the State's JOBS expenditures on 
applicants and recipients who are members of the State's target 
populations as defined in Sec. 250.1.
    (2) If any State IV-A agency demonstrates to the satisfaction of the 
Secretary that the characteristics of the caseload in that State make it 
infeasible to meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(1), and that the 
State is targeting an approved set of long-term or potential long-term 
recipients, the match rate in Sec. 250.73 shall be applied.
    (3) A State IV-A agency need not require or allow participation of 
an individual in the program if, as a result of such participation, the 
amount payable to the State for quarters in a fiscal year with respect 
to the program would be reduced pursuant to paragraph (a)(1).
    (b)(1) FFP for a State IV-A agency shall be 50 percent (rather than 
the rates described in Sec. 250.73) in any fiscal year for the State's 
JOBS expenditures if the State's participation rate (determined under 
paragraph (b)(2)) for the preceding fiscal year does not equal or 
exceed:
    (i) 7 percent if the preceding fiscal year is 1990;
    (ii) 7 percent if such year is 1991, however, no reduction in FFP 
shall be made in 1991 for any failure to meet the participation rate 
specified in (b)(1)(i);
    (iii) 11 percent if such year is 1992;
    (iv) 11 percent if such year is 1993;
    (v) 15 percent if such year is 1994; and
    (vi) 20 percent if such year is 1995.
    (2) The State IV-A agency's participation rate for a fiscal year 
shall be the average of its participation rates for computation periods 
in such fiscal year. The computation periods shall be:
    (i) The fiscal year, in the case of fiscal year 1990;

[[Page 172]]

    (ii) The first six months, and the seventh through twelfth months, 
in the case of fiscal year 1991;
    (iii) The first three months, the fourth through sixth months, the 
seventh through ninth months, and the tenth through twelfth months, in 
the case of fiscal years 1992 and 1993; and
    (iv) Each month, in the case of fiscal years 1994 and 1995.
    (3) The State IV-A agency's participation rate for a computation 
period shall be the number, expressed as a percentage, equal to:
    (i) The average monthly number of individuals required or allowed by 
the State to participate in the program, who have participated (as 
defined in Sec. 250.78) in such program in months in the computation 
period, plus the number of individuals required or allowed by the State 
to participate in such program, who have so participated in that month 
in such period for which the number of such participants is the 
greatest; divided by
    (ii) Twice the average monthly number of individuals required to 
participate in such period (other than individuals described in 
paragraphs (b)(9)(i) and (b)(9)(iv) of Sec. 250.30 with respect to whom 
the State IV-A agency has exercised its option to require their 
participation and individuals sanctioned under Sec. 250.34).
    (4) In determining the average monthly number of individuals 
required to participate as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii), the 
following individuals shall be excluded:
    (i) Those who are determined exempt in accordance with exemption 
criterion in Sec. 250.30(b);
    (ii) Those who on a case-by-case basis have been determined to have 
good cause for not participating;
    (iii) Those who reside in an area of the State in which the JOBS 
program is not operated; and
    (iv) Those who have been sanctioned.
    (5) If the Secretary determines that the State IV-A agency has 
failed to achieve the participation rate for any fiscal year, if the 
Secretary may waive, in whole or in part, the reduction in the payment 
rate otherwise required by paragraph (b)(1) if he finds that:
    (i) The State is in conformity with section 402(a)(19) and part F of 
the Act;
    (ii) The State has made a good faith effort to achieve the 
applicable participation rate for such fiscal year; and
    (iii) The State has submitted a proposal which is likely to achieve 
the applicable participation rate for the current fiscal year and the 
subsequent fiscal years (if any) specified therein.
    (c)(1) FFP for a State IV-A agency shall be 50 percent beginning in 
fiscal year 1995 for the State's JOBS expenditures (rather than the 
rates described in Sec. 250.73) if the percentage of UP cases meeting 
the participation requirements in Sec. 250.33, for the preceding fiscal 
year does not equal or exceed:
    (i) 40 percent in the case of the average of each month in fiscal 
year 1994;
    (ii) 50 percent in the case of the average of each month in fiscal 
year 1995;
    (iii) 60 percent in the case of the average of each month in fiscal 
year 1996; and
    (iv) 75 percent in the case of the average of each month in each of 
the fiscal years 1997 and 1998.
    (2) The percentage of participants for any month in a fiscal year 
for this purpose shall equal the average of:
    (i) The number of individuals described in Sec. 250.33 who have met 
the requirement therein; divided by
    (ii) The total number of principal earners (but excluding those in 
families who have been recipients of aid for 2 months or less if, during 
the period that the family received aid, at least one parent engaged in 
intensive job search as defined in Sec. 250.1).
    (3) If the Secretary determines that the State IV-A agency has 
failed to achieve the participation rate for any fiscal year specified 
above, the Secretary may waive, in whole or in part, the reduction in 
the payment rate otherwise required by paragraph (c)(1) if he finds 
that:
    (i) The State is in conformity with section 402(a)(19) and part F of 
the Act;
    (ii) The State has made a good faith effort to achieve the 
applicable participation rate and has been unable to do so because of 
economic conditions in the State, including significant numbers of 
recipients living in remote locations or isolated rural areas where the 
availability of work sites is severely

[[Page 173]]

limited, or because of rapid and substantial increases in the caseload 
that cannot reasonably be planned for; and
    (iii) The State has submitted a proposal which is likely to achieve 
the applicable participation rate for the current fiscal year and the 
subsequent fiscal years (if any) specified therein.


<R05>
Sec. 250.75  Activities excluded from FFP.

    (a) The costs of education or training activities (such as tuition, 
books, fees, room and board) that the State IV-A agency determines may 
constitute participation under the provisions of Sec. 250.48(a) shall 
not constitute federally reimbursable expenses for purposes of the JOBS 
program.
    (b) No funds shall be used for construction.
    (c) No funds shall be used to assist, promote, or deter union 
organizing.


<R05>
Sec. 250.76  Financial reports, records, statements and audits.

JOBS program: Part 92, ``Uniform administrative requirements for grants 
and cooperative agreements to State and local governments;'' Part 16, 
``Procedures of the Departmental Appeals Board;'' Part 30, ``Claims 
collection;'' Part 75, ``Informal grant appeals procedures;'' Part 95, 
``General administration-grant programs;'' and Part 201, ``Grants to 
States for public assistance programs.''
    (b) Financial reporting of JOBS program expenditures are generally 
subject to the requirements of the existing regulations at Sec. 201.5 
and Sec. 92.41, as appropriate.
    (c) Financial records and accounts shall be made available for audit 
purposes to the Secretary or any authorized representative.
    (d) JOBS program funds and activities shall be audited in conformity 
with the requirements of Secs. 92.26 and 74.62(a).
    (e) FFP improperly claimed under the JOBS program is subject to 
disallowance. If a State IV-A agency disagrees with a decision to 
disallow FFP, it can appeal within 30 days of the date of the 
disallowance decision. The procedures for appeal of AFDC disallowances 
apply, including review of the Departmental Appeals Board, in accordance 
with part 16 of the Department's regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 250.77  Costs matchable as AFDC payments.

    (a) Costs incurred by the State IV-A agency for supplemental AFDC 
payments shall be treated as title IV-A costs with respect to which 
sections 403(a)(1) or 403(a)(2) of the Act apply, when such payments are 
made in order that a recipient's family shall not experience a net loss 
of cash income from the recipient having been required by the State to 
accept a job.
    (b) Payments to employers under work supplementation as described at 
Sec. 250.62(l) shall be expenditures incurred by the State IV-A agency 
for AFDC.
    (c) States may claim as AFDC administrative expenditures those costs 
related to JOBS orientation, determination of mandatory status, and 
referral to the JOBS program when such activities are conducted by a 
title IV-A eligibility or income maintenance worker. When these same 
activities are conducted by JOBS staff, these costs must be claimed 
under title IV-F.


<R05>
Sec. 250.78  Definition of participation for enhanced FFP.

    (a) For the purpose of determining a State's participation rate 
under Sec. 250.74(b), the average monthly number of individuals who have 
participated will be the largest number of applicants and recipients 
whose combined and averaged weekly hours of participation in the 
activities specified in paragraph (b)(1) equals or exceeds 20 hours per 
week.
    (b) For the purpose of paragraph (a),
    (1) Activities include:
    (i) Assessment and employability plan development, but only for one 
month for each such individual for each period on AFDC;
    (ii) Any component specified in the State JOBS plan, with the 
exception of job development and job placement;
    (iii) Any approved self-initiated education or training pursuant to 
Sec. 250.48(a);
    (iv) Job entry, in the following manner. For the month in which the 
job entry occurs, an individual will be considered to be participating 
for the number of hours of work. Hours of work

[[Page 174]]

will then be included with hours of component activity in the month of 
the job entry in determining the average weekly activity level for the 
individual. Hours of work in the following month will be counted, 
provided the individual retains employment throughout the month. 
However, job entries will only be considered for:
    (A) Individuals who were participating in a JOBS component or 
activity during the month of the job entry, or the preceding calendar 
month, or;
    (B) Individuals who received job development and placement services 
during the month of job entry, or the preceding calendar month.
    (2) The number of hours counted for an individual will not include 
time spent commuting to or from the assignment or to or from a child 
care provider;
    (3) Individuals, other than those in high school, will not be 
considered to be participating in an educational activity during the 
period between school years. An individual enrolled and in attendance in 
high school during the last semester of the school year will be 
considered to be participating at her average weekly attendance level 
for the previous school year during the period between school years if 
she is expected to return to high school for the next school year. 
Individuals in all educational activities will be considered to be 
participating for the assigned hours during shorter, scheduled school 
breaks;
    (4) An individual will be considered to have satisfactorily 
participated if she attended an activity for at least 75 percent of the 
monthly hours scheduled. All hours of scheduled activity will be counted 
if the individual has satisfactorily participated. Neither hours of 
scheduled activity nor hours of participation will be counted if an 
individual has not satisfactorily participated.


<R04>
             Subpart I--Uniform Data Collection Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 250.80  Uniform data collection requirements.

    (a) A State IV-A agency must provide to the Department a sample of 
monthly unaggregated case record data containing such data and 
identifiers as are specified in Sec. 250.82, and such additional data as 
the Secretary may from time to time specify in an Action Transmittal or 
in reporting instructions.
    (1) The sample must be provided in formats specified by the 
Department. Data must be submitted electronically on an on-going basis 
by means of disk, tape or electronic connection, with all cases 
submitted no later than 45 days after the end of the month in which the 
sample is drawn.
    (2) Each record of the sample must contain an identifier that is not 
the Social Security number, and that protects the privacy of the 
individual pursuant to the requirements of Sec. 205.50.
    (3) The sample must be large enough to provide a precision of plus 
or minus two percentage points for an 0.2 attribute (p=20% or 0.2) at a 
95 percent confidence level. Submission of 100 percent of unaggregated 
JOBS case records is also acceptable.
    (4) The sample shall be drawn from the population of individuals 
scheduled to participate in a component, actively engaged in assessment 
or employability planning in the month, or who had a job entry in the 
sample month or the month previous to the sample month.
    (5) For each record in the sample, the State must verify that the 
individual satisfactorily participated in the sample month, as defined 
in Sec. 250.78, except that for individuals who entered employment, the 
State must verify only that the individual was employed at the end of 
the sample month.
    (b) For the purpose of determining participation rates, a State IV-A 
agency must report, for each month, on a quarterly basis, the aggregate 
number of individuals required to participate as specified in 
Sec. 250.74(b)(3)(ii).
    (c)(1) For the purpose of calculating whether a State spent 55 
percent of its title IV-F funds on target groups pursuant to 
Sec. 250.74(a), and determining the amounts spent per family by 
component and activity, each year a State IV-A agency may, instead of a 
cost-tracking system that identifies all funds spent on each individual, 
develop and submit to the Secretary a table of

[[Page 175]]

the previous Federal fiscal year's average total JOBS cost per 
participant per month of participation.
    (2) The average total cost data in the table must separately state:
    (i) For pre-component activity: assessment and related testing, 
employability development planning, and associated administrative and 
case management costs;
    (ii) For each component: component costs, and associated 
administrative and case management costs;
    (d) A State IV-A agency must submit any other information that the 
Secretary determines necessary.
    (e) Until October 1, 1991, or until sample based reporting is 
implemented, whichever is later, the State must submit such interim 
aggregate hardcopy reports as are required by the Secretary.


<R05>
Sec. 250.81  State data systems options.

    (a) A State IV-A agency may integrate its JOBs Automated System 
(JAS) with an existing or planned title IV-A system. A State IV-A agency 
may also use a stand-alone system. Either option must be a client-based 
information system capable of:
    (1) Producing at a minimum all data elements required in 
Sec. 250.82; and
    (2) Accepting referrals and exchanging data electronically with the 
title IV-A automated system and, the title IV-D automated system unless 
this exchange is otherwise met through the interface with the IV-A 
system.
    (b)(1) Title IV-A funding is available for planning, design, 
development and implementation of the JOBS interface between title IV-A 
and title IV-F requirements. The interface of an automated JOBS program 
with the title IV-A system, for verification of eligibility and 
reconciliation of data, includes planning, design, development and 
implementation of title IV-A systems to:
    (i) Manage information on eligibility factors and target group 
membership;
    (ii) Effect notifications and referrals including non-cooperation;
    (iii) Check records of applicants and recipients on a periodic basis 
with other agencies to verify continued eligibility; and
    (iv) Notify appropriate officials when a recipient ceases to be 
eligible.
    (2) If the JAS interfaces with an existing or planned FAMIS-type 
system and all FAMIS requirements are met, title IV-A FFP at 90 percent 
is available. Otherwise interface expenditures are matched at 50 percent 
under title IV-A.
    (c) JOBS funding is available at a 50 percent administrative rate 
for the acquisition and development of the remainder of the JAS, subject 
to the requirements of Sec. 205.35 through Sec. 205.38. This excludes 
the JOBS interface with the title IV-A system, but includes all other 
input, maintenance and reporting of those data elements required in 
Sec. 250.82 that cannot be obtained from the title IV-A system through 
the JOBS interface. A cost allocation plan must be approved to share the 
cost among all Federal and State programs benefiting from the State's 
JAS.
    (d) Administrative funding under either title IV-A or title IV-F for 
systems design, development, and implementation must comply with the 
requirements of Sec. 95.601, et seq.

[54 FR 42245, Oct. 13, 1989, as amended at 57 FR 47002, Oct. 14, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 250.82  Required case record data.

    (a) The State IV-A agency must maintain an individual case record

individual who is:
    (i) Actively engaged in assessment or employability planning during 
the month; or
    (ii) Assigned to a component, including self-initiated education or 
training pursuant to Sec. 250.48(a).
    (2) To the extent the State IV-A agency's JAS can access the 
required data in the required form from other systems, duplicate entry 
is to be avoided.
    (b) The minimum data required are:
    (1) Case identifier other than Social Security Number, but the State 
must maintain in its files a link between the identifier and the SSN;
    (2) Date of birth;
    (3) Program status and exemption code;
    (4) Youngest child's date of birth;
    (5) Date of most recent AFDC opening;

[[Page 176]]

    (6) Number of months within the most recent 60 months of receipt of 
AFDC;
    (7) Education level (highest grade completed) and date completed;
    (8) Literacy level, but only when the State elects to determine a 
literacy level;
    (9) Target group codes to identify which of the target groups 
specified in Sec. 250.1 an individual was a member of, if any, at the 
time of entry into JOBS, and the date of entry;
    (10) Identifier for a person not exempt, because the State elected 
to reduce the age of youngest child exemption to less than age three, or 
because the State elected to require participation of the second parent 
in a UP case where the second parent would otherwise be exempt for 
meeting the requirements of Sec. 250.30(b)(9);
    (11) Assignment status: scheduled hours, and beginning and ending 
dates, for each of the following that apply:
    (i) Assessment and employability development planning;
    (ii) Each JOBS component, including separate identification for 
self-initiated education or training, pursuant to Sec. 250.48(a);
    (iii) Job status, including date of job entry;
    (12) Identifier indicating that the individual satisfactorily 
participated in the JOBS program, as defined at Sec. 250.78, during the 
month, but only for sampled cases described in Sec. 250.80;
    (13) Amount of supportive services, other than child care, paid 
during the month;
    (14) Amount of child care payment for the month;
    (15) Type of child care;
    (16) Such additional data as the Secretary may from time to time 
specify in an Action Transmittal or in reporting instructions.

Subpart J--Operation of JOBS Programs by Indian Tribes and Alaska Native 
                              Organizations


<R05>
Sec. 250.90  Scope and purpose.

    The purpose of an Indian Tribe or Alaska Native organization JOBS 
program is to assure that Tribal (refers to both an Indian Tribe and 
Alaska Native organization) members receiving AFDC obtain the education, 
training and employment services they need to avoid long-term 
dependency. Tribal grantees are subject to all the regulations under 
part 250, unless otherwise indicated in this subpart, and regulations 
under parts 255, 74, and 92, which include general funding and 
disallowance and termination provisions for Federal programs.


<R05>
Sec. 250.91  Eligible Indian Tribe and Alaska Native organization grantees.

    Funds shall be allotted to operate a JOBS program pursuant to 
Sec. 250.71 to groups meeting the following eligibility standards:
    (a) An Indian Tribe, defined as any Tribe, band, nation, or other 
organized group or community of Indians which:
    (1) Is federally recognized as eligible for the special programs and 
services provided by the United States Government to Indians because of 
their status as Indians; and
    (2) Has a reservation, which means Indian reservation, public domain 
Indian allotment, or former Indian reservation in Oklahoma.
    (b) A consortium or Tribal organization representing more than one 
Tribe if each participating member Tribe meets the eligibility 
requirements for JOBS as defined in paragraph (a) of this section and if 
such consortium or organization meets the following criteria:
    (1) All the participating members must be in geographic proximity to 
one another. However, a consortium may operate in more than one State;
    (2) The consortium must demonstrate that it has the managerial, 
technical or administrative staff with the ability to properly 
administer government funds, manage a JOBS program, and comply with the 
provisions of the Statute and of the regulations;
    (3) The consortium must submit with its JOBS application a 
resolution from each participating Tribe authorizing the consortium to 
receive JOBS funds on behalf of each Tribe in its JOBS program.
    (c) An Alaska Native organization including any Alaska Native 
village, or regional or village corporation eligible to operate a 
Federal program under

[[Page 177]]

Public Law 93-638 (Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance 
Act, 25 U.S.C. 450) or such group's designee. The boundaries of an 
Alaska Native organization are those of the geographical region, 
established pursuant to section 7(a) of the Alaska Native Claims 
Settlement Act, (85 Stat. 688) within which the Alaska Native 
organization is located.


<R05>
Sec. 250.92  Selection criteria for eligible Alaska Native organizations.

    (a) The Secretary may approve only one application from an Alaska 
Native organization for each of the 12 geographical regions established 
pursuant to section 7(a) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. The 
Department shall designate the Alaska Native grantee for each geographic 
region based on the following criteria:
    (1) Previous experience in operating an effective employment and 
training program serving Indians and Native Alaskans;
    (2) The number and kinds of activities of similar magnitude and 
complexity that the applicant has successfully completed; and
    (3) The ability to provide services effectively to all eligible 
Native Alaskans residing in the region.
    (b) In order to be approved an Alaska Native application must 
promote the efficient and nonduplicative administration of the JOBS 
program in the State of Alaska.


<R05>
Sec. 250.93  Funding formula.

    (a) A Tribal grantee's share of program funds will be calculated 
annually pursuant to Sec. 250.71 and will be based on the following 
ratio:
    (1) The number of adult members of the Indian Tribe receiving AFDC 
who live in the designated service area compared to the total number of 
adult AFDC recipients in the State. The designated service area must 
include the reservation but can not extend to areas or communities which 
are not designated by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs as ``near 
reservation'' as defined at 25 CFR 20.1(r). Tribal grantees may exclude 
a portion of the reservation which is remote from that part of the 
reservation where JOBS services are provided; or
    (2) The number of adult Alaska Natives receiving AFDC who reside 
within the boundaries of the region which the organization represents to 
the total number of adult AFDC recipients in the State of Alaska.
    (3) Tribal member means a person who is enrolled in, or certified as 
meeting the membership requirements by the designated official of, that 
Indian Tribe or Alaska Native organization.
    (b)(1) The State IV-A agency and the Indian Tribe or Alaska Native 
organization must exchange available information on adult Tribal AFDC 
recipients needed to determine the eligible Tribal population and to 
define the designated service area, if other than the reservation or 
trust lands. State and Tribal representatives receiving such AFDC 
recipient data must follow standards of confidentiality to assure that 
recipient and Tribal privacy is protected pursuant to Sec. 205.50.
    (2) If sufficient data on adult AFDC recipient members of a Tribe or 
of an Alaska Native organization are not available, the State IV-A 
agency and the Tribe or organization may enter into an agreement 
covering a mutually agreed upon estimated figure of the eligible Tribal 
population or covering the designated service area.
    (3) If the State IV-A agency and the Tribe or organization cannot 
agree on the number of Tribal adult AFDC recipients or designated 
service area, the Secretary, in consultation with the Tribe or 
organization and State, will make the final determination of Tribal 
funding.
    (c) A Tribal grantee is not required to match Federal funds.
    (d) States with Tribal JOBS programs in operation or a pending 
application may require applicants and recipients living in the 
designated service area to provide Tribal membership status as a 
condition of eligibility for AFDC under the following conditions:
    (1) The information is necessary either to determine the number of 
adult members of an Indian Tribe or Alaska Native organization who 
receive AFDC, or to help determine whether such individual is to be 
served by a State or Tribal JOBS program;

[[Page 178]]

    (2) Upon requesting information about Tribal status, the State must 
explain the reason for its request for the information (e.g., to 
determine which JOBS program will serve the individual), and refer the 
individual to the appropriate Tribal JOBS program for further 
information;
    (3) Such information is only requested in those areas in which there 
is a Tribal JOBS program or an application pending and where a State 
JOBS program is also in operation; and
    (4) Information requested must relate only to membership in those 
Tribes or Alaska Native organizations operating or expected to operate a 
JOBS program in the area.


<R05>
Sec. 250.94  Program administration, implementation and operations.

    (a) The Tribal grantee must designate a Tribal agency or department 
to administer the Tribal JOBS program.
    (1) The designated agency or department will be responsible for the 
administration of the Tribal JOBS program including the requirements 
under 402(a)(19) and part F of the Act.
    (2) The responsibility for the administration of JOBS, pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section, includes functional areas such as 
exemption and priority determinations (Sec. 250.30), orientation and 
referrals (Sec. 250.40), assessment and the development of the 
employability plan (Sec. 250.41), JOBS activities (Sec. 250.44 and 
Sec. 250.94(e)), dispute resolution and hearings (Sec. 250.36). Certain 
other related functions are retained by the State IV-A agency. These 
include the administration of provisions on child care (part 255) and 
transitional child care services (part 256).
    (3) The designated agency or department may not delegate or contract 
out any functions which involve agency discretion, except as provided 
for in Sec. 250.10 of the regulations.
    (b) The Tribe or organization that submitted an application by April 
13, 1989, may begin operating its JOBS program as of the first day of 
any quarter between July 1, 1989 and October 1, 1990, independent of the 
State's JOBS implementation date. If the Tribe or organization elects to 
begin operating its program before the State, during this interim time 
period:
    (1) The Tribe or organization must guarantee necessary child care 
(without additional title IV-A funding for child care pursuant to part 
255) if it requires an individual to participate in its JOBS program.
    (2) If the Tribe or organization cannot guarantee necessary child 
care as described in paragraph (b)(1), it cannot require an individual 
to participate in its JOBS program but may operate an entirely voluntary 
program.
    (c) The Tribe or organization may not begin its JOBS program prior 
to approval of the Secretary. Final documentation for the application 
(meaning supplemental materials submitted after the initial April 13, 
1989 application) must be sent to the Department at least 45 days prior 
to implementation of the Tribal program. This will allow sufficient time 
for the Department's review and approval.
    (d)(1) Tribes or organizations shall not be subject to the specific 
requirements of Sec. 250.12 of the regulations, but must coordinate 
program services with appropriate agencies as follows:
    (i) The Tribal application with final documentation must be 
submitted to the State IV-A agency for its review and comment at least 
30 days before submittal to the Secretary. The Tribe or organization 
shall consider comments made by the State IV-A agency in its application 
submitted to the Secretary.
    (ii) The application with final documentation must also be made 
available to Tribal members for review and comment at least 30 days 
prior to submittal to the Secretary. The Tribe or organization must 
certify in its application that such public participation has taken 
place.
    (2) To operate a JOBS program, the Tribe or organization must 
coordinate with the State IV-A agency to ensure that interrelated 
program functions are effectively performed. These functions include 
State responsibilities--such as providing to the Tribal grantee 
eligibility notifications and the necessary child care funds or services 
for Tribal participation--and Tribal responsibilities--such as notifying 
the

[[Page 179]]

State IV-A agency when Tribal members fail to participate without good 
cause.
    (3) A Tribe or organization must consult and coordinate with other 
providers including those specified in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, 
to identify existing resources, prevent duplication of services, and 
ensure that the maximum level of services is available to enable 
participants to achieve self-sufficiency.
    (4) At a minimum, the Tribal grantee must consult and coordinate 
with:
    (i) The Tribal agency responsible for JTPA, if applicable;
    (ii) The Tribal agency responsible for other employment and training 
services, including those offered under the Bureau of Indian Affairs;
    (iii) The Tribal agency responsible for education, including any 
programs under the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Department of Interior, 
or under the Office of Indian Education of the Department of Education.
    (5) The Tribal grantee must consult with existing formal advisory 
councils, such as private industry councils, on the development of 
arrangements and contracts under JOBS, as described in Sec. 250.12(d).
    (6) The Tribal grantee must consult with private industry councils 
and Tribal Employment Rights Offices, as appropriate, to identify, and 
obtain advice on, the types of jobs available or likely to become 
available within a reasonable commuting distance from the Tribe's 
designated service area or the organization's boundaries. The Tribe or 
organization must ensure that JOBS provides training for the types of 
jobs which are, or are likely to become, available in or near its 
designated service area or organization's boundaries and that resources 
are not expended on training for jobs that are not likely to become 
available.
    (e) Tribal programs are subject to the requirements of Sec. 250.44 
but are not subject to the requirements of Sec. 250.45.
    (1) A Tribal JOBS program must include all the mandatory components 
at Sec. 250.44 unless the Tribe or organization can justify that such 
activities are inappropriate. A Tribe's or organization's application 
must describe the types of activities and methods of delivery for each 
of the mandatory components.
    (2) Tribal programs are not subject to the provisions at Sec. 250.45 
but must include at least one of the following components unless a Tribe 
or organization can justify that such activities are inappropriate:
    (i) Group and individual job search, as described in Sec. 250.60;
    (ii) On-the-job training, as described in Sec. 250.61;
    (iii) Community work experience program, as described in 
Sec. 250.63, or a work experience program as approved by the Secretary;
    (iv) Work supplementation program, as described in Sec. 250.62;
    (v) Alternative education, training and employment activities which 
are not described in Sec. 250.60, Sec. 250.61, Sec. 250.62 or 
Sec. 250.63, as approved by the Secretary.
    (A) Innovative approaches with the private sector are encouraged if 
they are consistent with the purpose of JOBS to assist AFDC recipients 
to avoid long-term dependency.
    (B) JOBS funds may not be used for public service employment or for 
allowances other than for those required for supportive services as 
described in part 255.
    (3) Because the amount of the IV-A payment is an integral part of 
determining participation in work supplementation and community work 
experience programs, a Tribe or organization may operate these programs 
only if adequate agreements with the State IV-A agency are implemented. 
The agreements should cover operational procedures and the exchange of 
information, including grant levels and child support calculations for 
community work experience participants and earnings for work 
supplementation participants.


<R05>
Sec. 250.95  Supportive services.

    (a) The Tribal grantee must provide, pay for, or reimburse necessary 
supportive services (other than child care) pursuant to part 255, 
including transportation and other work-related expenses, that the Tribe 
or organization determines are necessary to enable an individual to 
participate in JOBS.

[[Page 180]]

    (b) The State IV-A agency is responsible for guaranteeing child care 
for Tribal JOBS participants according to the provisions specified under 
part 255.
    (c) If the Tribe or organization is using child care funds or 
services provided by the State pursuant to paragraph (b) of this 
section, it must ensure, based on a method which is mutually acceptable 
to the State IV-A agency and Tribal grantee, that necessary child care 
is available when requiring an individual to participate in its program.
    (d) If the Tribe or organization does not choose to use State funds 
or services for child care, it must provide (without additional title 
IV-A funding for child care) these funds or services in order to 
guarantee necessary child care when requiring an individual to 
participate.
    (e) Once the State has implemented its JOBS program, the Tribe or 
organization, in order to require an individual to participate, must 
guarantee necessary child care either through the State IV-A agency, 
pursuant to paragraphs (b) and (c), or directly, pursuant to paragraph 
(d) of this section; but it may not operate an entirely voluntary JOBS 
program.


<R05>
Sec. 250.96  Waiver authority.

    The Secretary may waive any JOBS requirements set forth under 
section 402(a)(19) and part F of the Act that he determines

<R05>
Sec. 251.0  Purpose.

    (a) The purpose of this part 251 is to set forth the conditions 
generally applicable when assigning participants to program activities 
(i.e., work, education or training) under the Jobs Opportunity and Basic 
Skills Training (JOBS) program. This part contains the following:
    (1) The conditions that the State agency shall assure when assigning 
participants to any program activity;
    (2) Appropriate workers' compensation and tort claims protections 
that must be provided to participants;
    (3) Provisions to assure that work assignments shall not result in 
displacements;
    (4) A grievance procedure for resolving displacement complaints by 
regular employees;
    (5) A grievance procedure under the State fair hearing process with 
respect to on-the-job working conditions, workers' compensation, and 
wage rates in the case of individuals participating in community work 
experience programs (CWEP); and
    (6) Procedures for appealing State decisions on displacement 
complaints and certain other complaints to the Department of Labor.
    (b) The provisions of this part apply to any work-related programs 
and activities under JOBS and under any other work-related programs and 
activities authorized in connection with the Aid to Families with 
Dependent Children (AFDC) program under section 1115 of the Social 
Security Act.


<R05>
Sec. 251.1  Program activity conditions.

    (a) Program activity. The State agency shall assure that:
    (1) The program activity shall be related to the capability of the 
participant to perform the task on a regular basis, including physical 
capacity, skills, experience, family responsibilities and place of 
residence.
    (2) The total daily commuting time to and from home to the program 
activity site to which the participant is assigned shall not normally 
exceed 2 hours, not including the transporting of a child to and from 
child care. If a longer commuting distance and time is generally 
accepted in the community, then the round trip commuting time shall not 
exceed the generally accepted community standards without the 
participant's consent.
    (3) No participant shall be required, without his or her consent, to 
remain away from his or her home overnight.
    (4) The conditions of participation shall be reasonable, taking into 
account in each case the proficiency of the participant and the child 
care and other supportive service needs of the participant.
    (5) Training shall be appropriate. For training to be appropriate, 
the nature of the training shall, to the extent practicable, meet local 
employers' requirements (including their occupational needs) so that the 
participant will be in a competitive position within the local labor 
market. The training must also be likely to lead to employment which 
will meet the provisions in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this 
section.
    (b) Health and safety standards. Participants are subject to the 
same health and safety standards established under State and Federal law 
that otherwise apply to other individuals in similar activities who are 
not JOBS participants.

[[Page 183]]

    (c) Non-discrimination. All participants will have such rights as 
are available under any applicable Federal, State or local law 
prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, sex, national origin, 
religion, age or handicapping condition. Individuals alleging 
discrimination may choose to have their complaints processed as a JOBS 
program dispute pursuant to Sec. 250.36, as a violation of other 
applicable State and local laws prohibiting discrimination, or as a 
violation of 45 CFR parts 80, 84 and 91.


<R05>
Sec. 251.2  Workers' compensation and tort claims protections.

    (a) Each participant covered by a workers' compensation statute or 
system shall be assured of workers' compensation including medical, 
accident and income maintenance insurance at the same level and to the 
same extent as that available to others who are similarly employed.
    (b) Those participants in work assignments such as work 
supplementation and CWEP not covered by an applicable workers' 
compensation statute shall be provided with medical and accident 
protection for on-site injury at the same level and to the same extent 
as that required under the applicable State's workers' compensation 
statute for covered employment. Income maintenance coverage is not 
required for these participants.
    (c) For the purpose of this section, medical insurance means that 
the employer must provide for the participant's medical care due to 
injury arising from, and in the course of, the participant's activity; 
accident insurance means tort claims protection; and income maintenance 
insurance means the monetary workers' compensation allowance.


<R05>
Sec. 251.3  Displacement.

    The State agency shall assure that CWEP, other work experience, on-
the-job training (OJT), and work supplementation assignments:
    (a) Shall not result in the displacement of any currently employed 
worker or position, including partial displacement, such as a reduction 
in hours of non-overtime work, wages, or employment benefits;
    (b) Shall not impair existing contracts for services or collective 
bargaining agreements;
    (c) Shall not result in the employment or assignment of a 
participant or the filling of a position when any other person is on 
layoff from the same or a substantially equivalent job within the same 
organizational unit, or when an employer has terminated any regular 
employee or otherwise reduced its workforce with the effect of filling 
the vacancy so created by hiring a participant whose wages are 
subsidized under this program;
    (d) Shall not infringe in any way upon promotional opportunities of 
any currently employed individual; and
    (e) Shall not result in the filling of any established unfilled 
position vacancy by a participant assigned under Sec. 250.62 (work 
supplementation program) or Sec. 250.63 (CWEP) of the JOBS program.


<R05>
Sec. 251.4  Grievances by regular employees.

    (a) The State shall establish and maintain a grievance procedure for 
resolving complaints by regular employees or their representatives that 
the work assignment of an individual violates any of the prohibitions 
described in Sec. 251.3.
    (b) Such grievance procedure shall include an opportunity for 
informal resolution.
    (c) If no informal resolution can be reached within the specified 
time period as established by the State as part of its grievance 
procedure, the dissatisfied party may file a request for a hearing with 
the State.
    (d) The State's hearing portion of the grievance procedure shall 
provide the following: A written notice of the date, time and place of 
the hearing; a hearing on the record; an opportunity to present 
evidence, bring witnesses, cross-examine witnesses; representation by 
counsel; and a written decision.
    (e) The State's grievance procedure, pursuant to the provisions in 
paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, shall not exceed 90 days 
from the date of the complaint, by which time the

for himself or herself, as verified by the State based upon a 
determination by a physician or a licensed or certified psychologist; or 
under court supervision (and for a child who would be a dependent child 
except for the receipt of benefits under Supplemental Security Income 
under title XVI or foster care under title IV-E), to the extent that 
such child care is necessary to permit an AFDC eligible family member 
to--
    (1) Accept employment or remain employed; or
    (2) Participate in an approved education or training activity under 
JOBS (including self-initiated education or training pursuant to 
Sec. 250.48(a)), or in approved education or training consistent with 
criteria in the State's Supportive Services plan for approval of 
education or training in non-JOBS areas.
    (b) The guarantee under paragraph (a) also applies to Tribal members 
who are subject to participation requirements under subpart J of part 
250, consistent with the requirement in paragraph (f).
    (c)(1) The State IV-A agency must provide, pay for, or reimburse 
transportation and other work-related expenses (including work-related 
supportive services) which it determines are necessary to enable an 
individual to participate in approved JOBS activities under part 250, 
including self-initiated education or training pursuant to 
Sec. 250.48(a)).
    (2)(i) The State agency may provide, pay for, or reimburse 
transportation and other work-related expenses (including work-related 
supportive services) which it determines are necessary to enable a 
recipient to participate in approved education or training in non-JOBS 
areas;
    (ii) Approval of education and training for necessary supportive 
services in non-JOBS areas must be consistent with criteria established 
in the Supportive Services plan.
    (3)(i) The State agency may provide, pay for, or reimburse one-time,

JOBS program or, in non-JOBS areas, through procedures established in 
accordance with Sec. 255.1(d)(2).
    (d) The State IV-A agency may provide for child care and other 
necessary supportive services for an individual who is waiting to enter 
an approved education, training, or JOBS component or employment:
    (1) For a period not to exceed two weeks; or
    (2) For a period not to exceed one month where child care (or other

activity is scheduled to begin within that period.
    (e) The State IV-A agency must provide child care and supportive 
services necessary:
    (1) For applicants to participate in job search pursuant to 
Sec. 250.60; and
    (2) For applicants and recipients to participate in other approved

    (f) The State IV-A agency must make child care services available to 
applicants and recipients who are participating in a JOBS program 
operated by an Indian Tribe or Alaska Native organization, pursuant to 
Secs. 250.94 and 250.95. Child care services, which are also appropriate 
in meeting any special needs of Tribal participants, must be made 
available on an equitable basis. To the extent it is appropriate, the

[[Page 188]]

same range of reimbursement methods must be available to Tribal JOBS 
participants as are available to participants in the State JOBS program.
    (g)(1) The State IV-A agency must inform families requesting child 
care under this part of their rights and responsibilities.
    (2) The State IV-A agency must respond to a request for child care 
under this part within a reasonable period of time.
    (h) AFDC applicants and recipients are entitled to hearings under 
the provisions of Secs. 205.10 or 250.36, as appropriate, on issues 
concerning the appropriateness of, denial of, prompt issuance of, or 
intended actions to discontinue, terminate, suspend or reduce assistance 
under this part. However:
    (1) Changes in the manner of payment are not subject to timely 
notice requirements unless they result in a discontinuation, suspension, 
reduction, or termination of benefits, or they force a change in child 
care arrangements; and
    (2) The provisions of Sec. 205.10(a)(6) regarding aid paid pending a 
hearing do not apply.


<R05>
Sec. 255.3  Methods of providing child care and other supportive services.

    (a) The State IV-A agency may use any of the following methods for 
guaranteeing the availability of child care:
    (1) Providing the care directly;
    (2) Arranging the care through providers by use of purchase of 
service contracts or vouchers;
    (3) Providing cash or vouchers in advance to the caretaker relative 
in the family;
    (4) Reimbursing the caretaker relative in the family;
    (5) Arranging with other agencies and community volunteer groups for 
non-reimbursed care;
    (6) Using the child care disregard as provided in 
Sec. 233.20(a)(11)(i); or
    (7) Adopting such other arrangements as the State IV-A agency deems 
appropriate.
    (b) In arranging for child care, the State IV-A agency must take 
into account the individual needs of the child, including the reasonable 
accessibility of the care to the child's home and school, or caretaker's 
place of employment or training (based on normally accepted standards in 
the community or State), and the appropriateness of the care to the age 
and special needs of the child.
    (c) If more than one type of child care is available, e.g., center, 
group family care, family day care or in-home care, the caretaker 
relative must be provided an opportunity to choose the arrangement. The 
State IV-A agency may select the method of payment under paragraph (a).
    (d)(1) An individual required to participate under part 250 may 
refuse available appropriate child care as determined by the State IV-A 
agency, if she can arrange other child care or can show that such 
refusal will not prevent or interfere with participation in approved 
education or training activities (including JOBS) or employment.
    (2) The State IV-A agency must establish at least one method by 
which self-arranged child care can be paid.
    (e)(1) If a State IV-A agency chooses to meet the cost of child care 
through a method other than use of the child care disregard at 
Sec. 233.20(a)(11)(i), the State IV-A agency must then determine AFDC 
eligibility and payment amount without this disregard, except for 
families described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
    (2) In the case of a family which was receiving AFDC on October 13, 
1988, based on application of the child care disregard at 
Sec. 233.20(a)(11)(i) or through the provision of special needs, if such 
a family would be disadvantaged as a result of meeting the cost of child 
care through another method which does directly affect AFDC eligibility, 
the State must determine the family's AFDC eligibility and payment 
(including child care needs), as if the method of provision which was 
applicable on October 13, 1988, is still in effect.
    (f)(1) For cases subject to retrospective budgeting, the State IV-A 
agency has the option to meet the cost of child care directly for the 
first one or two months of employment and then to apply the child care 
disregard at Sec. 233.20(a)(11)(i) to offset income received in those 
initial one or two months in determining the AFDC payment for the 
corresponding payment

[[Page 189]]

months. The State IV-A agency's payment shall not be counted as income 
or resources for any month. Under these circumstances, a State IV-A 
agency may not apply the disregard to income used to determine the 
amount of the payment for the month(s) following the month in which 
child care ceases.
    (2) The State IV-A agency, at its option, may provide a supplemental 
payment to a family when the amount available through the disregard is 
less than the amount that would be available if another method were 
used.
    (g) The State IV-A agency may assure the availability of necessary 
transportation and other work-related expenses (including other work-
related supportive services) through direct provision, or payment, or 
reimbursement of costs consistent with its Supportive Services plan.
    (h) Each State IV-A agency must coordinate:
    (1) Its child care activities with existing child care resource and 
referral agencies and with early childhood education programs in the 
State, including Head Start programs, preschool programs funded under 
Chapter 1 of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981, 
and school and nonprofit child care programs (including community-based 
organizations receiving funds designated for preschool programs for 
handicapped children); and
    (2) Its supportive services with related services provided by other 
agencies.


<R05>
Sec. 255.4  Allowable costs and matching rates.

    (a) FFP is available for the actual cost of child care up to a 
statewide limit established by the State IV-A agency in its State 
Supportive Services plan, but not for more than the applicable local 
market rate.
    (1) In setting the statewide limit:
    (i) The State IV-A agency may choose the amount of the child care 
disregard at Sec. 233.20(a)(11)(i), or some higher amount(s); and
    (ii) The State agency may specify a higher statewide limit for 
children with special needs.
    (2) The applicable local market rates must be determined:
    (i) Based on representative samples of child care providers or 
slots;
    (ii) For all political subdivisions or for alternative areas which 
represent reasonable local child care markets based upon their 
geographic proximity or common characteristics; and
    (iii) Based on the 75th percentile cost of such types of care in the 
local areas. (However, where there are only one or two providers of a 
type of care in a local market area, the rate may be set at the 100th 
percentile.)
    (3) Local market rates must:
    (i) Be established for center care, group family care, family day 
care, and in-home care;
    (ii) Differentiate among care for children with special needs, 
infants, toddlers, pre-school and school-age children, where applicable;
    (iii) Differentiate between full-time and part-time care, if 
applicable; and
    (iv) Consider reductions in the cost of care for additional children 
in the same family.
    (b)(1) Except for Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, and 
American Samoa, in the case of amounts expended for child care, FFP 
shall be at the Federal medical assistance program (Medicaid) rate and 
is included in the title IV-A general program entitlement.
    (2) For Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, and American Samoa, 
the rate is 75 percent and is included in the JOBS limit of entitlement.
    (c) FFP is available only if:
    (1) The entity providing the care allows parental access; and
    (2) The care meets applicable standards of State and local law, and/
or Tribal law, where applicable.
    (i) Applicable standards are licensing or regulatory requirements 
which apply to a category of care in the State, local area, or Indian 
reservation regardless of the source of payment for the care, except as 
provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.
    (ii) At State option, the State may deny payment under this part for 
care that does not meet requirements designed to protect the health and 
safety of children that are applicable to child care providers under 
other Federal or State programs in the following areas (as described in 
the State's Supportive Services plan):

[[Page 190]]

    (A) The prevention and control of infectious diseases (including 
immunization);
    (B) Building and physical premises safety; and
    (C) Minimum health and safety training appropriate to the provider 
setting.
    (iii) Requirements applied pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this 
section must not exclude or have the effect of excluding any categories 
of child care providers.
    (d) In the case of amounts expended for transportation and other 
work-related expenses and supportive services for eligible individuals, 
FFP shall be at the rate of 50 percent and is subject to the annual 
limit of entitlement, pursuant to Sec. 250.73(b)(1).
    (e) The State IV-A agency is not permitted to provide payment for 
child care or any other supportive service or work-related expense as an 
AFDC special need pursuant to Sec. 233.20(a)(2)(v)(B)(2).
    (f) FFP is not available for:
    (1) Recruitment or training of child care providers, resource 
development, or licensing activities; or
    (2) Payments made for care provided by parents, legal guardians, or 
members of the assistance unit (including essential persons).
    (g) The matching rate for child care administrative costs under this 
part is 50 percent and, except for Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin 
Islands, and American Samoa, the amount is outside the funding 
limitation for JOBS.
    (h) The State IV-A agency must take reasonable precautions to guard 
against fraud and abuse in the funding of child care costs, consistent 
with requirements at Sec. 235.110.
    (i)(1) Federal matching funds improperly claimed for child care 
services or administration are subject to disallowance under part 201. 
If the State IV-A agency disagrees with the decision to disallow FFP, it 
can appeal under existing title IV-A procedures, including review of the 
Departmental Appeals Board in accordance with part 16 of these 
regulations.
    (2) Financial reporting of child care expenditures is generally 
subject to the requirements of the existing regulations at Sec. 201.5.
    (3) Child care expenditures are generally subject to the 
requirements of part 201, including the provisions at Sec. 201.5(e) 
(regarding the applicability of most of the requirements of part 74 to 
the administration of grants to States), the provisions at subpart B 
(regarding review and audits), and the provisions of Sec. 201.67 
(regarding treatment of uncashed or cancelled checks).
    (j)(1) The State must take all reasonable steps necessary to 
promptly correct any overpayment to a recipient or a service provider 
under this section (or part 256). An overpayment to a family or provider 
currently receiving child care payments or benefits must be recovered 
through repayment (in part or in full) by the family or provider 
responsible for the overpayment or by recovering the overpayment through 
a reduction in the amount payable to the family or provider.
    (2) State IV-A agencies need not attempt recovery of overpayments 
from providers if obligated to make the full payment under contract; 
however, FFP may not be claimed for such overpayments.
    (3) In recovering overpayments from a recipient family, the State 
shall provide that the family retains, for any month, a reasonable 
amount of funds.
    (4) Recoupment of child care overpayments may be made only from 
child care benefits; and recoupment of supportive services overpayments 
may be made only from supportive services benefits. Any recoveries of 
child care or supportive services overpayments may be made from AFDC 
benefit payments only upon a voluntary request of the recipient family.
    (5) Overpayments to individuals may be recovered from the family 
unit which was overpaid, from individuals who were members of the family 
when overpaid, or from families which include members of a previously 
overpaid family. In cases of former recipients or recipients who refuse 
to repay, recovery shall be made by appropriate action under State law 
against the income and resources of the overpaid individual or family.
    (6) Underpayments and overpayments may be offset against each other 
in correcting incorrect payments.

[[Page 191]]

    (7) Recovery must be attempted in all cases of fraud, in all cases 
involving current recipients, and in all cases where the overpayment 
amount would equal or exceed the costs of recovery.
    (8) States must collect and maintain information on the collection 
of overpayments and make appropriate adjustments for Federal matching, 
consistent with requirements established by the Secretary.

Sec. 255.5  Child care standards.

    (a) The State IV-A agency must establish procedures to ensure that 
center-based child care will be subject to State and local (and/or 
Tribal, where applicable) requirements designed to ensure basic health 
and safety (including fire safety) protections.
    (b) The State must also endeavor to develop guidelines for family 
day care if it has not already done so.
    (c) Upon request of the Secretary, the State IV-A agency must make 
available information on applicable standards of State and local law, 
including the requirements specified in paragraph (a) of this section

shall be separately stated with respect to families who have earnings 
and those who do not, and with respect to families who are receiving aid 
under the State IV-A plan and those who are not.

[[Page 192]]

(and for a child who would be a dependent child except for the receipt 
of benefits under Supplemental Security Income under title XVI or foster 
care under title IV-E), to the extent that such care is necessary to 
permit a member of an AFDC family to accept or retain employment.
    (b) A family is eligible for transitional child care provided the 
following conditions are met:
    (1) The family must have ceased to be eligible for AFDC as a result 
of increased hours of, or increased income from, employment or the loss 
of income disregards due to the time limitations at Sec. 233.20(a)(11);

included in paragraph (b)(1), and continues for a period of 12 
consecutive months. Families may begin to receive child care in any 
month during the 12-month eligibility period.
    (d) The family is not eligible for child care under this part for 
any remaining portion of the 12-month period if the caretaker relative:
    (1) Terminates employment without good cause, as defined in

    (e)(1) If the caretaker relative loses a job with good cause, and 
then finds another job, the family can qualify for the remaining portion 
of the 12-month eligibility period.
    (2) If the family re-establishes eligibility for AFDC during this 
period, it could qualify for a new 12-month eligibility period if it met

<R05>
Sec. 256.3  Fee requirement.

    (c) A State IV-A agency may vary the period of collection for 
different fee levels.
    (d) The State IV-A agency may establish whether fees are paid to the 
providers or the State agency. In cases where the family's contribution 
is paid to the State IV-A agency, such contribution is subject to the 
program income requirements in Sec. 74.42(c), subpart F. Claims for 
Federal matching funds for child care expenditures shall be adjusted to 
reflect collection of fees under this part.
    (e) Individuals who fail to cooperate in paying required fees will, 
subject to appropriate notice and hearings requirements, lose 
eligibility for benefits under this part for so long as back fees are 
owed, unless satisfactory arrangements are made to make full payment.


<R05>
Sec. 256.4  Other provisions.

    (a) The State IV-A agency, in providing transitional child care, 
must meet the requirements in Secs. 255.3(a) paragraphs (1)-(5) and (7),

child care services. States must assure that the amount of funding from 
other sources for each subsequent period is maintained at the level of 
effort established for the base period.
    (2) The base period is a twelve-month period (e.g., the State fiscal 
year) which includes the month one year prior to the first month for 
which the State has either an approved interim application or approved 
final plan for the At-Risk Child Care program. Subsequent periods are 
each twelvemonth period following the preceding period. States may 
establish base period(s) and associated levels of effort on:
    (i) A level of government basis (e.g., Federal or State); or

<R05>
Sec. 301.12  Submittal of State plan for Governor's review.

    The State plan must be submitted to the State Governor for his 
review and comments, and the State plan must provide that the Governor 
will be given opportunity to review State plan amendments and long-range 
program planning projections or other periodic reports thereon. This 
requirement does not apply to periodic statistical or budget and other 
fiscal reports. Under this requirement, the Office of the Governor will 
be afforded a specified period in which to review the material. Any 
comments made will be transmitted to the Office with the documents.

(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 
0960-0253)

<R05>
Sec. 301.13  Approval of State plans and amendments.

    The State plan consists of written documents furnished by the State 
to cover its Child Support Enforcement program under title IV-D of the 
Act. After approval of the original plan by the Office, all relevant 
changes, required by new statutes, rules, regulations, interpretations, 
and court decisions, are required to be submitted currently so that the 
Office may determine whether the plan continues to meet Federal 
requirements and policies.
    (a) Submittal. State plans and revisions of the plans are submitted 
first to the State governor or his designee for review in accordance 
with Sec. 301.12, and then to the regional office. The States are 
encouraged to obtain consultation of the regional staff when a plan is 
in process of preparation or revision.
    (b) Review. The Office of Child Support Enforcement in the regional 
offices is responsible for review of State plans and amendments. It also 
initiates discussion with the IV-D agency on clarification of 
significant aspects of the plan which come to its attention in the 
course of this review. State plan material on which the regional staff 
has questions concerning the application of Federal policy is referred 
with recommendations as required to the Office of Child Support 
Enforcement in the central office for technical assistance. Comments and 
suggestions, including those of consultants in specified areas, may be 
prepared by the central office for use by the regional staff in 
negotiations with the IV-D agency.
    (c) Action. The Regional Office exercises delegated authority to 
take affirmative action on the State plan and amendments thereto on the 
basis of policy statements or precedents previously approved by the 
Director. The Director retains authority for determining that proposed 
plan material is not approvable, or that a previously approved plan no 
longer meets the requirements for approval, except that a final 
determination of disapproval may not be made without prior consultation 
and discussion by the Director with the Secretary. The Regional Office 
or the Director formally notifies the IV-D agency of the actions taken 
on the State plan or revisions thereto.
    (d) Basis for approval. Determinations as to whether the State plan 
(including plan amendments and administrative practice under the plan) 
originally meets or continues to meet the requirements for approval are 
based on relevant Federal statutes and regulations. Guidelines are 
furnished to assist in the interpretation of the regulations.
    (e) Prompt approval of the State plan. The determination as to 
whether the State plan submitted for approval conforms to the 
requirements for approval under the Act and regulations issued pursuant 
thereto shall be made promptly and not later than the 90th day following 
the date on which the plan submittal is received in the regional office, 
unless the Regional Office has secured from the IV-D agency a written 
agreement to extend that period.

[[Page 205]]

    (f) Prompt approval of plan amendments. Any amendment of an approved 
State plan may, at the option of the State, be considered as a 
submission of a new State plan. If the State requests that such 
amendments be so considered, the determination as to its conformity with 
the requirements for approval shall be made promptly and not later than 
the 90th day following the date on which such a request is received in 
the Regional Office with respect to an amendment that has been received 
in such office, unless the Regional Commissioner has secured from the 
State agency a written agreement to extend that period.
    (g) Effective date. The effective date of a new plan may not be 
earlier than the first day of the calendar quarter in which an 
approvable plan is submitted.

0960-0253)

<R05>
Sec. 301.14  Administrative review of certain administrative decisions.

    Any State dissatisfied with a determination of the Director pursuant 
to Sec. 301.13 (e) or (f) with respect to any plan or amendment may, 
within 60 days after the date of receipt of notification of such 
determination, file a petition with the Regional Office asking the 
Director for reconsideration of the issue of whether such plan or 
amendment conforms to the requirements for approval under the Act and 
pertinent Federal requirements. Within 30 days after receipt of such a 
petition, the Director shall notify the State of the time and place at 
which the hearing for the purpose of reconsidering such issue will be 
held. Such hearing shall be held not less than 30 days nor more than 60 
days after the date notice of such hearing is furnished to the State, 
unless the Director and the State agree in writing on another time. The 
hearing procedures contained in 45 CFR part 213 applicable to Sec. 201.4 
of this title shall apply to reconsiderations brought under this 
section. A determination affirming, modifying, or reversing the 
Director's original decision will be made within 60 days of the 
conclusion of the hearing. Action pursuant to an initial determination 
by the Director described in such Sec. 301.1 (e) or (f) that a plan or 
amendment is not approvable shall not be stayed pending the 
reconsideration, but in the event that the Director subsequently 
determines that his original decision was incorrect he shall certify 
restitution forthwith in a lump sum of any funds incorrectly withheld or 
otherwise denied.


<R05>
Sec. 301.15  Grants.

    To States with approved plans, a grant is made each quarter for 
expenditures under the plan for the administration of the Child Support 
Enforcement program. The determination as to the amount of a grant to be 
made to a State is based upon documents submitted by the IV-D agency 
containing information required under the Act and such other pertinent 
facts as may be found necessary.
    (a) Form and manner of submittal--
    (1) Time and place. An estimate for a grant for each quarterly 
period must be forwarded to the Regional Office 45 days prior to the 
period of the estimate. It includes a certification of State funds and a 
justification statement in support of the estimate. A statement of 
quarterly expenditures and any necessary supporting schedules must be 
forwarded to the Department of Health and Human Services, Administration 
for Children and Families, Office of Program Support, Division of 
Formula, Entitlement and Block Grants, 370 L'Enfant Promenade, S.W., 
Washington, DC 20447, not later than 30 days after the end of the 
quarter.
    (2) Description of forms. ``State Agency Expenditure Projection--
Quarterly Projection by Program'' represents the IV-D agency's estimate 
of the total amount and the Federal share of expenditures for the 
administration of the title IV-D program for the quarter. From this 
estimate the State and Federal shares of the total expenditures are 
computed. The State's computed share of total estimated expenditures is 
the amount of State and local funds necessary for the quarter. The 
Federal share is the basis for the funds to be advanced for the quarter. 
The agency

[[Page 206]]

must also certify, on this form or otherwise, the amount of State funds 
(exclusive of any balance of advances received from the Federal 
Government) actually on hand and available for expenditure; this 
certification must be signed by the executive officer of the IV-D agency 
submitting the estimate or a person officially designated by him, or by 
a fiscal officer of the State if required by State law or regulation. (A 
form ``Certificate of Availability of State Funds for Assistance and 
Administration during Quarter'' is available for submitting this 
information, but its use is optional.) If the amount of State funds (or 
State and local funds if localities participate in the program), shown 
as available for expenditures is not sufficient to cover the State's 
proportionate share of the amount estimated to be expended, the 
certification must contain a statement showing the source from which the 
amount of the deficiency is expected to be derived and the time when 
this amount is expected to be made available.
    (3) The IV-D agency must also submit a quarterly statement of 
expenditures for the title IV-D program. This is an accounting statement 
of the disposition of the Federal funds granted for past periods and 
provides the basis for making the adjustments necessary when the State's 
estimate for any prior quarter was greater or less than the amount the 
State actually expended in that quarter. The statement of expenditures 
also shows the share of the Federal Government in any recoupment, from 
whatever source, of expenditures claimed in any prior period, and also 
in expenditures not properly subject to Federal financial participation 
which are acknowledged by the IV-D agency or have been revealed in the 
course of an audit.
    (b) Review. The State's estimate is analyzed by the regional office 
and is forwarded with recommendations as required to the central office. 
The central office reviews the State's estimate, other relevant 
information, and any adjustments to be made for prior periods, and 
computes the grant.
    (c) Grant award. The grant award computation form shows the amount 
of the estimate for the ensuing quarter, and the amounts by which the 
estimate is reduced or increased because of over- or under-estimate for 
the prior quarter and for other adjustments. This form is transmitted to 
the IV-D agency to draw the amount of the grant award as needed, to meet 
the Federal share of disbursements. The draw is through a commercial 
bank and the Federal Reserve system against a continuing letter of 
credit certified to the Secretary of the Treasury in favor of the State 
payee. A notice of the amount of the grant award is sent to the State 
Central Information Reception Agency in accord with section 201 of the 
Intergovernmental Cooperation Act of 1968.
    (d) Letter of credit payment system. The letter of credit system for 
payment of advances of Federal funds was established pursuant to 
Treasury Department regulations. (Circular No. 1075), published in the 
Federal Register on July 11, 1967 (32 FR 10201). The HHS ``Instructions 
to Recipient Organizations for Use of Letter of Credit'' was transmitted 
to all grantees by memorandum from the Assistant Secretary-Comptroller 
on January 15, 1968.
    (e) General administrative requirements. With the following 
exceptions, the provisions of part 74 of this title, establishing 
uniform administrative requirements and cost principles, shall apply to 
all grants made to States under this part:

                             45 CFR Part 74

45 CFR 74.23 Cost Sharing or Matching.
45 CFR 74.52 Financial Reporting.

<R05>
Sec. 301.16  Withholding of advance funds for not reporting.

    (a) No advance for any quarter will be made unless full and complete 
reports on expenditures and collections, as required by Secs. 301.15 and 
302.15 of this chapter, respectively, have been submitted to the Office 
by the IV-D agency for all quarters with the exception of the two 
quarters immediately preceding the quarter for which the advance is to 
be made.

[[Page 207]]

    (b) For purposes of this section, a report is full and complete if:
    (1) All line items of information are reported in accordance with 
OCSE instructions; and
    (2) The report contains all applicable information available to the 
State and appropriate for inclusion in the report for the quarter being 
reported and prior quarters.

    (2) Employees of a court or law enforcement official performing 
under a cooperative agreement with the IV-D agency.
    (3) Employees of any private or governmental entity from which the 
IV-D agency purchases services.
    (c) Bond. The bond will be for an amount which the State IV-D agency

from employee dishonesty.
    (d) Self-bonding System. A State or political subdivision may comply 
with the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section:
    (1) By means of a self-bonding system established under State law 
or,
    (2) In the case of a political subdivision, by means of a self-
bonding system approved by the State IV-D agency.

Sec. 302.20  Separation of cash handling and accounting functions.

    The State plan shall provide that the following requirements and 
criteria to separate the cash handling and accounting functions are in 
effect.
    (a) IV-D responsibility. The IV-D agency will maintain methods of 
administration designed to assure that persons responsible for handling 
cash receipts of support do not participate in accounting or operating 
functions which would permit them to conceal in the accounting records 
the misuse of support receipts. Such methods of administration shall 
follow generally recognized accounting standards.
    (b) Scope. The requirement in paragraph (a) of this section applies 
to persons who participate in the collection, accounting or operating 
functions which include:
    (1) IV-D agency employees and employees of any other State or local 
agency to which IV-D functions have been delegated.
    (2) Employees of a court or law enforcement official performing 
under a cooperative agreement with the IV-D agency.
    (3) Employees of any private or governmental entity from which the 
IV-D agency purchases services.

[[Page 210]]

    (c) Exception. The Regional Office may grant a waiver to sparsely 
populated geographical areas, where the requirements in paragraph (a) of 
this section would necessitate the hiring of unreasonable numbers of 
additional staff. The IV-D agency must document such administrative 
infeasibility and provide an alternative system of controls that 
reasonably insures that support collections will not be misused.

<R05>
Sec. 302.30  Publicizing the availability of support enforcement services.

    Effective October 1, 1985, the State plan shall provide that the 
State will publicize regularly and frequently the availability of 
support enforcement services under the plan through public service 
announcements. Publicity must include information on any application 
fees which may be imposed for such services and a telephone number or 
postal address where further information may be obtained.

Sec. 302.31  Establishing paternity and securing support.

    The State plan shall provide that:
    (a) The IV-D agency will undertake:
    (1) In the case of a child born out of wedlock with respect to whom 
an assignment as defined in Sec. 301.1 of this chapter is effective, to 
establish the paternity of such child; and
    (2) In the case of any individual with respect to whom an assignment 
as defined in Sec. 301.1 of this chapter is effective, to secure support 
for a child or children from any person who is legally liable for such 
support, using State laws and reciprocal arrangements adopted with other 
States when appropriate. Effective October 1, 1985, this includes 
securing support for a spouse or former spouse who is living with the 
child or children, but only if a support obligation has been established 
for that spouse and the child support obligation is being enforced under 
the title IV-D State plan.
    (3) When assigned support payments are received and retained by an 
AFDC recipient, to proceed as follows:
    (i) In States that implement the IV-A State plan requirements to 
count retained support payments as income under 45 CFR 233.20(a)(3)(v), 
the IV-D agency shall notify the IV-A agency whenever it discovers that 
directly received payments are being, or have been, retained; or
    (ii) In States that do not implement the IV-A State plan 
requirements to count retained support payments as income to meet need, 
the IV-D agency shall recover the retained support payments. This 
recovery by the IV-D agency shall be carried out in accordance with the 
standards for program operations provided in Sec. 303.80 of this 
chapter.
    (4) When assigned medical support payments are received and retained 
by a non-AFDC Medicaid recipient, the IV-D agency shall notify the 
Medicaid agency whenever it discovers that directly received medical 
support payments are being, or have been, retained.
    (b) Upon receiving notice from the IV-A, IV-E or Medicaid agency 
that there has been a claim of good cause for failure to cooperate, the 
IV-D agency will suspend all activities to establish paternity or secure 
support until notified of a final determination by the appropriate 
agency.
    (c) The IV-D agency will not undertake to establish paternity or 
secure support in any case for which it has received notice from the IV-
A, IV-E or Medicaid agency that there has been a finding of good cause 
unless there has been a determination by the IV-A, IV-E or Medicaid 
agency, as appropriate, that support enforcement may proceed without the 
participation of the caretaker or other relative. If there has been such 
a determination, the IV-D agency will undertake to establish paternity 
or secure support but may not

[[Page 211]]

involve the caretaker or other relative in such undertaking.

Sec. 302.32  Collection and distribution of support payments by the IV-D agency.

    The State plan shall provide that:
    (a) In any case in which support payments are collected for a 
recipient of aid under the State's title IV-A plan with respect to whom 
an assignment under Sec. 232.11 is effective, such payments shall be 
made to the IV-D agency and shall not be paid directly to the family.
    (b) The IV-D agency must inform the State's IV-A agency of the 
amount of the collection which represents payment on the required 
support obligation for the month as determined in Sec. 302.51(a) within 
10 working days of the end of the month in which the support is received 
by the IV-D agency responsible for final distribution. Upon being 
informed of this amount, the IV-A agency will determine if such amount 
is sufficient to make the family ineligible for an assistance payment 
pursuant to the State's IV-A plan (See Sec. 232.20 of Chapter II of this 
title.) If such amount is sufficient to make the family ineligible for 
an assistance payment, the IV-A agency will notify the IV-D agency and 
the IV-D agency will distribute the amount collected pursuant to 
Sec. 302.51 of this part. The IV-D agency will notify the family that it 
will continue to provide services pursuant to Sec. 302.33 of this part.
    (c) If the IV-A agency determines that the amount of the collection 
which represents payment on the required support obligation for the 
month does not make the family ineligible for an assistance payment, or 
if a hearing is requested pursuant to Sec. 205.10 of this title, the IV-
A agency will notify the IV-D agency of such fact and the IV-D agency 
will distribute such amount pursuant to Sec. 302.51 of this part.
    (d) To the extent any amount collected in a month includes payment 
on required support obligations for past months, that portion of such 
amount will be distributed by the IV-D agency pursuant to Sec. 302.51(b) 
(4) and (5) of this part.
    (e) Support collected in a month after any month in which the 
support collected makes the family ineligible for an assistance payment 
(pursuant to Sec. 232.20 of this title) but prior to or in the month in 
which the family receives its last assistance payment, shall be used to 
reimburse the State for any assistance paid in such months with any 
excess being paid to the family. This provision will not apply when a 
hearing is requested pursuant to Sec. 205.10 of this title. In these 
cases, when the hearing results in a determination that the family was 
ineligible for an assistance payment, the IV-D agency will determine the 
amount by which the entire support collection for a month that the 
family would have received pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section 
exceeds the amount the family actually received for a month as an 
assistance payment and pursuant to Sec. 302.51. Such excess shall be 
paid to the family. If the family is determined to be eligible, 
distribution will continue to be made pursuant to Sec. 302.51.
    (f) Timeframes for distribution of support payments. (1) In 
interstate IV-D cases, amounts collected by the responding State on 
behalf of the initiating State must be forwarded to the initiating State 
within 15 calendar days of the initial point of receipt in the 
responding State, in accordance with Sec. 303.7(c)(7)(iv).
    (2) Amounts collected by the IV-D agency on behalf of recipients of 
aid under the State's title IV-A or IV-E plan for whom an assignment 
under Sec. 232.11 of this title or section 471(a)(17) of the Act is 
effective shall be distributed as follows:
    (i) When the IV-D agency sends payments to the family under 
Sec. 302.51(b)(1) of this part, the IV-D agency must send payments to 
the family within 15 calendar days of the end of the month in which the 
support was initially received in the State.
    (ii) Except as specified under paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of this section:
    (A) When the IV-D agency sends collections to the family under 
Sec. 302.51(b) (3) and (5) of this part, the IV-D agency

[[Page 212]]

must send collections to the family within 15 calendar days of the end 
of the month in which the support was initially received in the State.
    (B) When the IV-D agency sends collections to the family for the 
month after the month the family becomes ineligible for AFDC, the IV-D 
agency must send collections to the family within 15 calendar days of 
the date in which the support was initially received in the State.
    (iii) Except as specified under paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of this 
section, when the IV-D agency sends collections to the IV-E foster care 
agency under Sec. 302.52(b)-(2) and (4) of this part, the IV-D agency 
must send collections to the IV-E agency within 15 calendar days of the 
end of the month in which the support was initially received in the 
State.
    (iv) Collections as a result of Federal or State income tax refund 
offset paid to the family under Sec. 302.51(b)(5) of this part, or 
distributed in title IV-E foster care cases under Sec. 302.52(b)(4) of 
this part, must be sent to the AFDC family or IV-E agency, as 
appropriate, within 30 calendar days of the date of initial receipt by 
the IV-D agency, unless State law requires a post-offset appeal process 
and an appeal is filed timely, in which case the IV-D agency must send 
any payment to the AFDC family or IV-E agency within 15 calendar days of 
the date the appeal is resolved.
    (3) Amounts collected on behalf of individuals receiving services 
under Sec. 302.33 of this part shall be distributed as follows:
    (i) Amounts collected which represent payment on the current support 
obligation shall be sent to the family within 15 calendar days of the 
date of initial receipt in the State.
    (ii) Except as specified in paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of this section, 
if the amount collected is more than the amount required to be 
distributed in paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section, the State may at its 
discretion either send such amounts to the family to satisfy past-due 
support within 15 calendar days of the date of initial receipt in the 
State or retain such amounts as have been assigned to satisfy assistance 
paid to the family which has not been reimbursed.
    (iii) Collections due the family under Sec. 302.51(b)(5) as a result 
of Federal or State income tax refund offset must be sent to the family 
within 30 calendar days of the date of receipt in the IV-D agency, 
except:
    (A) If State law requires a post-offset appeal process and an appeal 
is timely filed, in which case the IV-D agency must send any payment to 
the family within 15 calendar days of the date the appeal is resolved; 
or
    (B) As provided in Sec. 303.72(h)(5) of this chapter.

Sec. 302.33  Services to individuals not receiving AFDC or title IV-E foster care assistance.

    (a) Availability of Services. (1) The State plan must provide that 
the services established under the plan shall be made available to any 
individual who:
    (i) Files an application for the services with the IV-D agency. In 
an interstate case, only the initiating State may require an application 
under this section; or
    (ii) Is a non-AFDC Medicaid recipient; or
    (iii) Has been receiving IV-D services and is no longer eligible for 
assistance under the AFDC, IV-E foster care, and Medicaid program.
    (2) The State may not require an application, other request for 
services or an application fee from any individual who is eligible to 
receive services under paragraphs (a)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section. 
If an individual receiving services under paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this 
section refuses services in response to a notice under paragraph (a)(4) 
of this section, and subsequently requests services, that individual 
must file an application and pay an application fee.
    (3) The State may not charge fees or recover costs from any 
individual who is eligible to receive services under paragraph 
(a)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (4) Whenever a family is no longer eligible for assistance under the 
State's AFDC, IV-E foster care, and Medicaid

[[Page 213]]

programs, the IV-D agency must notify the family, within five working 
days of the notification of ineligibility, that IV-D services will be 
continued unless the IV-D agency is notified to the contrary by the 
family. The notice must inform the family of the consequences of 
continuing to receive IV-D services, including the available services 
and the State's fees, cost recovery and distribution policies.
    (5) The State must provide all appropriate IV-D services, in 
addition to IV-D services related to securing medical support, to all 
individuals who are eligible to receive services under paragraph 
(a)(1)(ii) of this section unless the individual notifies the State that 
only IV-D services related to securing medical support are wanted.
    (b) Definitions. For purposes of this section:
    Applicant's income means the disposable income available for the 
applicant's use under State law.
    (c) Application fee. (1) Beginning October 1, 1985, the State plan 
must provide that an application fee will be charged for each individual 
who applies for services under this section. Under this paragraph:
    (i) The State shall collect the application fee from the individual 
applying for IV-D services or pay the application fee out of State 
funds.
    (ii) The State may recover the application fee from the absent 
parent who owes a support obligation to a non-AFDC family on whose 
behalf the IV-D agency is providing services and repay it to the 
applicant or itself.
    (iii) State funds used to pay an application fee are not program 
expenditures under the State plan but are program income under 
Sec. 304.50 of this chapter.
    (iv) Any application fee charged must be uniformly applied on a 
statewide basis and must be:
    (A) A flat dollar amount not to exceed $25 (or such higher or lower 
amount as the Secretary may determine to be appropriate for any fiscal 
year to reflect increases or decreases in administrative costs); or
    (B) An amount based on a fee schedule not to exceed the flat dollar 
amount specified in paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(A) of this section. The fee 
schedule must be based on the applicant's income.
    (v) The State may allow the jurisdiction that collects support for 
the State under this part to retain any application fee collected under 
this section.
    (2) In an interstate case, the application fee is charged by the 
State where the individual applies for services under this section.
    (d) Recovery of costs. (1) The State may elect in its State plan to 
recover any costs incurred in excess of any fees collected to cover 
administrative costs under the IV-D State plan. A State which elects to 
recover costs shall collect on a case by case basis either excess actual 
or standardized costs:
    (i) From the individual who owes a support obligation to a non-AFDC 
family on whose behalf the IV-D agency is providing services under this 
section; or
    (ii) From the individual who is receiving IV-D services under 
paragraph (a)(1) (i) or (iii) of this section, either directly or from 
the support collected on behalf of the individual, but only if the State 
has in effect a procedure for informing all individuals authorized 
within the State to establish an obligation for support that the State 
will recover costs from the individual receiving IV-D services under 
paragraphs (a)(1) (i) and (iii) of this section.
    (2) A State that recovers standardized costs under paragraph (d)(1) 
of this section shall develop a written methodology to determine 
standardized costs which are as close to actual costs as is possible. 
This methodology must be made available to any individual upon request.
    (3) The IV-D agency shall not treat any amount collected from the 
individual as a recovery of costs under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this 
section except amounts which exceed the current support owed by the 
individual under the obligation.
    (4) If a State elects to recover costs under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of 
this section, the IV-D agency may attempt to seek reimbursement from the 
individual who owes a support obligation for any costs paid by the 
individual who is receiving IV-D services and pay all amounts reimbursed 
to the individual who is receiving IV-D services.

[[Page 214]]

    (5) If a State elects to recover costs under this section, the IV-D 
agency must notify, consistent with the option selected, either the 
individual who is receiving IV-D services under paragraphs (a)(1) (i) or 
(iii) of this section, or the individual who owes a support obligation 
that such recovery will be made. In an interstate case, the IV-D agency 
where the case originated must notify the individual receiving IV-D 
services of the States that recover costs.
    (6) The IV-D agency must notify the IV-D agencies in all other 
States if it recovers costs from the individual receiving IV-D services.

collected, except as provided under paragraphs (a)(3) of this section, 
shall be treated first as payment on the required support obligation for 
the month in which the support was collected and if any amounts are 
collected which are in excess of such amount, these excess amounts shall 
be treated as amounts which represents payment on the required support 
obligation for previous months.
    (2) In AFDC and title IV-E foster care cases in which conversion to 
a monthly amount is necessary because support is ordered to be paid 
other than monthly, the IV-D agency may round off the converted amount 
to whole dollar amounts for the purpose of distribution under this 
section and Sec. 302.52 of this part.
    (3) Amounts collected through Federal and State income tax refund

withholding and received by the IV-D agency on or after January 1, 1989, 
the date of collection for distribution purposes in all IV-D cases must 
be the date the wages or other income are withheld to meet the support 
obligation. If the employer fails to report the date of withholding, the 
IV-D agency must reconstruct that date by contacting the employer or 
comparing actual amounts collected with the pay schedule specified in 
the court or administrative order.
    (5) Except with respect to those collections addressed under 
paragraph (a) (3) and (4) of this section:
    (i) Effective June 9, 1988, the date of collection for distribution 
purposes in all IV-D cases shall be the date on which the payment is 
received by the IV-D agency or the legal entity of any State or 
political subdivision actually making the collection, whichever is 
earliest; and
    (ii) Effective January 1, 1989, a State may use on a statewide basis 
either the definition of the date of collection in paragraph (a)(5)(i) 
of this section or the date the payment is mailed, as evidenced by a 
legible U.S. Postal Service postmark or a legibly dated receipt from a 
commercial carrier, as the date of collection in all IV-D cases.
    (b) The amounts collected as support by the IV-D agency pursuant to 
the State plan for children and the parents of such children who are 
current recipients of aid under the State's title IV-A plan and for whom 
an assignment under Sec. 232.11 of this title is effective shall be 
distributed as follows:
    (1) Of such amounts as are collected periodically which represent 
monthly support payments, the first $50 of any payments for a month 
received in that month, and the first $50 of payments for each prior 
month received in that month which were made by the absent parent in the 
month when due, shall be paid to the family. This payment may not be 
used in determining the amount paid, if any, to the family in paragraph 
(b)(3) of this section. If the amount collected includes payment on the 
required support obligation for a previous month or months, the family 
shall only receive the first $50 of the amount which represents the 
required support obligation for the month in which the support was 
collected. If amounts are collected for one family which represent 
support payments from two or more absent parents, only the first $50 of 
the amount collected which represents the total required support 
obligation for the month in which the support was collected shall be 
paid to the family under this paragraph. No payment shall be made to a 
family under this paragraph for a month in which there is no child 
support collection.
    (2) Any amount that is collected in a month which represents payment 
on the required support obligation for that month and is in excess of 
the amount paid to the family under paragraph (b)(1) of this section 
shall be retained by the State to reimburse, in whole or in part, the 
assistance payment for the month in which the support was collected or 
the next month. Of the amount retained by the State as reimbursement for 
that month's assistance payment, the IV-D agency shall determine the 
Federal Government's share of the amount so retained so the IV-A agency 
may reimburse the Federal Government to the extent of its participation 
in the financing of the assistance payment. From the Federal 
government's share, the State IV-D agency or political subdivision of 
the State pursuant to the title IV-D State plan shall deduct and pay the 
incentive payment, if any, prescribed in Sec. 304.12.
    (3) If the amount collected is in excess of the amount required to 
be distributed under paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section, the 
family shall be paid such excess up to the difference between the 
assistance payment for the month in which the amount of the collection 
was used to redetermine eligibility for an assistance payment under the 
State's title IV-A plan (see Sec. 302.32) and the court ordered amount 
for that month. If such court ordered amount is less than such 
assistance payment, no amount shall be paid to the family under this 
paragraph. In cases in which there is no court order, the family shall 
not be paid any amount under this paragraph.

[[Page 217]]

    (4) If the amount collected is in excess of the amounts required to 
be distributed under paragraphs (b) (1) through (3) of this section, any 
such excess shall be retained by the State as reimbursement for past 
assistance payments made to the family for which the State has not been 
reimbursed. The State may apply the amount retained to any sequence of 
months for which it has not yet been reimbursed. Of the amount retained 
by the State as reimbursement of past assistance payments, the IV-D 
agency shall determine the Federal Government's share of the amounts so 
retained so the IV-A agency may reimburse the Federal Government to the 
extent of its participation in the financing of the assistance payments. 
From the Federal government's share, the State IV-D agency or political 
subdivision of the State pursuant to the title IV-D State plan shall 
deduct and pay the incentive payment, if any, prescribed in Sec. 304.12. 
If past assistance payments are greater than the total support 
obligation owed, the maximum amount the State may retain as 
reimbursement for such assistance payments is the amount of such 
obligation, unless amounts are collected which represent the required 
support obligation for periods prior to the first month in which the 
family received assistance under the State's title IV-A plan, in which 
case such amounts may be retained by the State to reimburse the 
difference between such support obligation and such assistance payments.
    (5) If the amount collected is in excess of the amounts required to 
be distributed under paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section, such 
excess shall be paid to the family.
    (c) If an amount collected as support represents payment on the 
required support obligation for future months, the amount shall be 
applied to such future months. However, no such amounts shall be applied 
to future months unless amounts have been collected which fully satisfy 
the support obligation assigned under section 402(a)(26) of the Act for 
the current month and all past months.
    (d) Any amount paid under paragraph (b) (1), (3) or (5) of this 
section shall be identified as not being an assistance payment.
    (e)(1) The amounts collected by the IV-D agency which represent 
specific dollar amounts designated in the support order for medical 
purposes that have been assigned to the State under 42 CFR 433.146 shall 
be forwarded to the Medicaid agency for distribution under 42 CFR 
433.154.
    (2) When a family ceases receiving assistance under the State's 
title XIX plan, the assignment of medical support rights under section 
1912 of the Act terminates, except for the amount of any unpaid medical 
support obligation that has accrued under such assignment. The IV-D 
agency shall attempt to collect any unpaid specific dollar amounts 
designated in the support order for medical purposes. Under this 
requirement, any medical support collection made by the IV-D agency 
under this paragraph shall be forwarded to the Medicaid agency for 
distribution under 42 CFR 433.154.
    (f) When a family ceases receiving assistance under the State's 
title IV-A plan, the assignment of support rights under Sec. 232.11 of 
this title terminates, except with respect to the amount of any unpaid 
support obligation that has accrued under such assignment. From this 
accrued amount, the IV-D agency shall attempt to collect such unpaid 
obligation. Under this requirement:
    (1) Such collections shall be used to reimburse any amounts of past 
assistance which have not been reimbursed under paragraph (b)(4) of this 
section;
    (2) Of the amount collected, the IV-D agency shall determine the 
Federal Government's share of the collection so the IV-A agency may 
reimburse the Federal Government to the extent of its participation in 
the financing of the assistance payments. From the Federal Government's 
share the State IV-D agency or political subdivision of the State 
pursuant to the title IV-D State plan shall deduct and pay the incentive 
payment, if any, prescribed in Sec. 304.12;
    (3) Only amounts collected pursuant to this paragraph which exceed 
the amount of unreimbursed past assistance shall be paid to the family;
    (4) For those cases in which collections are authorized under

[[Page 218]]

Sec. 302.33(a)(1)(iii), priority shall be given to collection of current 
support.

Sec. 302.52  Distribution of support collected in Title IV-E foster care maintenance cases.

    Effective October 1, 1984, the State plan shall provide as follows:
    (a) For purposes of distribution under this section, amounts 
collected in foster care maintenance cases shall be treated in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 302.51(a) of this part.
    (b) The amounts collected as support by the IV-D agency under the 
State plan on behalf of children for whom the State is making foster 
care maintenance payments under the title IV-E State plan and for whom 
an assignment under section 471(a)(17) of the Act is effective shall be 
distributed as follows:
    (1) Any amount that is collected in a month which represents payment 
on the required support obligation for that month shall be retained by 
the State to reimburse itself for foster care maintenance payments. Of 
that amount retained by the State as reimbursement for that month's 
foster care maintenance payment, the State IV-D agency shall determine 
the Federal government's share so that the State may reimburse the 
Federal government to the extent of its participation in financing of 
the foster care maintenance payment.
    (2) If the amount collected is in excess of the monthly amount of 
the foster care maintenance payment but not more than the monthly 
support obligation, the State must pay the excess to the State agency 
responsible for supervising the child's placement and care under section 
472(a)(2) of the Act. The State agency must use the money in the manner 
it determines will serve the best interests of the child including:
    (i) Setting aside amounts for the child's future needs; or
    (ii) Making all or part of the amount available to the person 
responsible for meeting the child's daily needs to be used for the 
child's benefit.
    (3) If the amount collected exceeds the amount required to be 
distributed under paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section, but not 
the total unreimbursed foster care maintenance payments provided under 
title IV-E or unreimbursed assistance payments provided under title IV-
A, the State shall retain the excess to reimburse itself for these 
payments. If past assistance or foster care maintenance payments are 
greater than the total support obligation owed, the maximum amount the 
State may retain as reimbursement for such payments is the amount of 
such obligation. If amounts are collected which represent the required 
support obligation for periods prior to the first month in which the 
family received assistance under the State's title IV-A plan or foster 
care maintenance payments under the State's title IV-E plan, such 
amounts may be retained by the State to reimburse the difference between 
such support obligation and such payments. Of the amounts retained by 
the State, the State IV-D agency shall determine the Federal 
government's share of the amount so that the State may reimburse the 
Federal government to the extent of its participation in financing the 
assistance payments and foster care maintenance payments.
    (4) Any balance shall be paid to the State agency responsible for 
supervising the child's placement and care and shall be used to serve 
the best interests of the child as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section.
    (5) If an amount collected as support represents payment on the 
required support obligation for future months, the amount shall be 
applied to those future months. However, no amounts shall be applied to 
future months unless amounts have been collected which fully satisfy the 
support obligation assigned under Sec. 232.11 of this title and section 
471(a)(17) of the Act for the current month and all past months.
    (c) When a State ceases making foster care maintenance payments 
under

[[Page 219]]

the State's title IV-E State plan, the assignment of support rights 
under section 471(a)(17) of the Act terminates except for the amount of 
any unpaid support that has accrued under the assignment. The IV-D 
agency shall attempt to collect such unpaid support. Under this 
requirement, any collection made by the State under this paragraph must 
be distributed in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

Sec. 302.54  Notice of collection of assigned support.

    (a) Effective January 1, 1993, the State plan shall provide that the 
State has in effect procedures for issuing notices of collections as 
follows:
    (1) The IV-D agency must provide a monthly notice of the amount of 
support payments collected for each month to individuals who have 
assigned rights to support under Sec. 232.11 of this title, unless no 
collection is made in the month, the assignment is no longer in effect 
and there are no longer any assigned arrearages, or the conditions in 
paragraph (c) of this section are met.
    (2) The monthly notice must list separately payments collected from 
each absent parent when more than one absent parent owes support to the 
family and must indicate the amount of current support collected, the 
amount of arrearages collected and the amount of support collected which 
was paid to the family.
    (b)(1) The Office may grant a waiver to permit a State to provide 
quarterly, rather than monthly, notices, if the State:
    (i) Until September 30, 1997, does not have an automated system that 
performs child support enforcement activities consistent with 
Sec. 302.85 or has an automated system that is unable to generate 
monthly notices; or
    (ii) Uses a toll-free automated voice response system which provides 
the information required under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (2) A quarterly notice must be provided in accordance with 
conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and such notice 
must contain the information set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this

Sec. 302.56  Guidelines for setting child support awards.

    (a) Effective October 13, 1989, as a condition of approval of its 
State plan, the State shall establish one set of guidelines by law or by 
judicial or administrative action for setting and modifying child 
support award amounts within the State.
    (b) The State shall have procedures for making the guidelines 
available to all persons in the State whose duty it is to set child 
support award amounts.
    (c) The guidelines established under paragraph (a) of this section 
must at a minimum:
    (1) Take into consideration all earnings and income of the absent 
parent;
    (2) Be based on specific descriptive and numeric criteria and result 
in a computation of the support obligation; and

[[Page 220]]

    (3) Provide for the child(ren)'s health care needs, through health 
insurance coverage or other means.
    (d) The State must include a copy of the guidelines in its State 
plan.
    (e) The State must review, and revise, if appropriate, the 
guidelines established under paragraph (a) of this section at least once 
every four years to ensure that their application results in the 
determination of appropriate child support award amounts.
    (f) Effective October 13, 1989, the State must provide that there 
shall be a rebuttable presumption, in any judicial or administrative 
proceeding for the award of child support, that the amount of the award 
which would result from the application of the guidelines established 
under paragraph (a) of this section is the correct amount of child 
support to be awarded.
    (g) A written finding or specific finding on the record of a 
judicial or administrative proceeding for the award of child support 
that the application of the guidelines established under paragraph (a) 
of this section would be unjust or inappropriate in a particular case 
shall be sufficient to rebut the presumption in that case, as determined 
under criteria established by the State. Such criteria must take into 
consideration the best interests of the child. Findings that rebut the 
guidelines shall state the amount of support that would have been 
required under the guidelines and include a justification of why the 
order varies from the guidelines.
    (h) As part of the review of a State's guidelines required under 
paragraph (e) of this section, a State must consider economic data on 
the cost of raising children and analyze case data, gathered through 
sampling or other methods, on the application of, and deviations from, 
the guidelines. The analysis of the data must be used in the State's 
review of the guidelines to ensure that deviations from the guidelines 
are limited.

Sec. 302.65  Withholding of unemployment compensation.

    The State plan shall provide that the requirements of this section 
are met.
    (a) Definitions. When used in this section:
    Legal process means a writ, order, summons or other similar process 
in the nature of a garnishment, which is

[[Page 221]]

issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or by an authorized official 
pursuant to an order of such court or pursuant to State or local law.
    State employment security agency or SESA means the State agency 
charged with the administration of the State unemployment compensation 
laws in accordance with title III of the Act.
    Unemployment compensation means any compensation payable under State 
unemployment compensation law (including amounts payable in accordance 
with agreements under any Federal unemployment compensation law). It 
includes extended benefits, unemployment compensation for Federal 
employees, unemployment compensation for ex-servicemen, trade 
readjustment allowances, disaster unemployment assistance, and payments 
under the Redwood National Park Expansion Act.
    (b) Agreement. The State IV-D agency shall enter into a written 
agreement with the SESA in its State for the purpose of withholding 
unemployment compensation from individuals with unmet support 
obligations being enforced by the IV-D agency. The IV-D agency shall 
agree only to a withholding program that it expects to be cost-effective 
and to reimbursement for the SESA's actual, incremental costs of 
providing services to the IV-D agency.
    (c) Functions to be performed by the IV-D agency. The IV-D agency 
shall:
    (1) Determine periodically from information provided by the SESA 
under section 508 of the Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1976 
whether individuals applying for or receiving unemployment compensation 
owe support obligations that are being enforced by the IV-D agency.
    (2) Enforce unmet support obligations by arranging for the 
withholding of unemployment compensation based on a voluntary agreement 
with the individual who owes the support, or in appropriate cases which 
meet the case selection criteria established under paragraph (c)(3), 
through legal process pursuant to State or local law. If a voluntary 
agreement is obtained, the IV-D agency must give the SESA a copy of the 
voluntary agreement.
    (3) Establish and use written criteria for selecting cases to pursue 
via the withholding of unemployment compensation for support purposes. 
These criteria must be designed to insure maximum case selection and 
minimal discretion in the selection process.
    (4) Provide a receipt at least annually to an individual who 
requests a receipt for the support paid via the withholding of 
unemployment compensation, if receipts are not provided through other 
means.
    (5) Maintain direct contact with the SESA in its State:
    (i) By processing cases through the SESA in its own State or through 
IV-D agencies in other States; and
    (ii) By receiving all amounts withheld by the SESA in its own State 
and forwarding any amounts withheld on behalf of IV-D agencies in other 
States to those agencies.
    (6) Reimburse the administrative costs incurred by the SESA that are 
actual, incremental costs attributable to the process of withholding 
unemployment compensation for support purposes insofar as these costs 
have been agreed upon by the SESA and the IV-D agency.
    (7) Review and document, at least annually, program operations, 
including case selection critieria established under paragraph (c)(3), 
and costs of the withholding process versus the amounts collected and, 
as necessary, modify procedures and renegotiate the services provided by 
the SESA to improve program and cost effectiveness.

withholding so that a portion of the absent parent's wages may be 
withheld, in accordance with the requirements set forth in Sec. 303.100 
of this chapter;
    (2) Expedited processes to establish paternity and to establish and 
enforce child support orders having the same force and effect as those 
established

[[Page 222]]

through full judicial process, in accordance with the requirements set 
forth in Sec. 303.101 of this chapter;
    (3) Procedures for obtaining overdue support from State income tax 
refunds on behalf of individuals receiving IV-D services, in accordance 
with the requirements set forth in Sec. 303.102 of this chapter;
    (4) Procedures for the imposition of liens against the real and 
personal property of absent parents who owe overdue support, in 
accordance with the requirements set forth in Sec. 303.103 of this 
chapter;
    (5)(i) Procedures for the establishment of paternity for any child 
at least to the child's 18th birthday, including any child for whom 
paternity has not yet been established and any child for whom a 
paternity action was previously dismissed under a statute of limitations 
of less than 18 years; and
    (ii) Effective November 1, 1989, procedures under which the State is 
required (except in cases where the individual involved has been found 
under Secs. 232.40 through 232.49 of this title or 42 CFR 433.147 to 
have good cause for refusing to cooperate or if, in accordance with 
Sec. 303.5(b) of this chapter the IV-D agency has determined that it 
would not be in the best interest of the child to establish paternity in 
a case involving incest or forcible rape, or in any case in which legal 
proceedings for adoption are pending) to require the child and all other 
parties in a contested paternity case to submit to genetic tests upon 
the request of any such party, in accordance with Sec. 303.5 (d) and (e) 
of this chapter.
    (iii) Procedures for a simple civil process for voluntarily 
acknowledging paternity under which the State must provide that the 
rights and responsibilities of acknowledging paternity are explained, 
and ensure that due process safeguards are afforded. Such procedures 
must include:
    (A) A hospital-based program in accordance with Sec. 303.5(g) for 
the voluntary acknowledgment of paternity during the period immediately 
before or after the birth of a child to an unmarried mother, and a 
requirement that all public and private birthing hospitals participate 
in the hospital-based program defined in Sec. 303.5(g)(2); and
    (B) A process for voluntarily acknowledging paternity outside of 
hospitals.
    (iv) Procedures under which the voluntary acknowledgment of 
paternity creates a rebuttable or, at the option of the State, 
conclusive presumption of paternity, and under which such voluntary 
acknowledgment is admissible as evidence of paternity;
    (v) Procedures which provide that any objection to genetic testing 
results must be made in writing within a specified number of days before 
any hearing at which such results may be introduced into evidence; and 
if no objection is made, a written report of the test results is 
admissible as evidence of paternity without the need for foundation 
testimony or other proof of authenticity or accuracy;
    (vi) Procedures which create a rebuttable or, at the option of the 
State, conclusive presumption of paternity upon genetic testing results 
indicating a threshold probability of the alleged father being the 
father of the child;
    (vii) Procedures under which a voluntary acknowledgment must be 
recognized as a basis for seeking a support order without requiring any 
further proceedings to establish paternity; and
    (viii) Procedures requiring a default order to be entered in a 
paternity case upon a showing that process was served on the defendant 
in accordance with State law, that the defendant failed to respond to 
service in accordance with State procedures, and any additional showing 
required by State law.
    (6) Procedures which require that an absent parent give security, 
post a bond, or give some other guarantee to secure payment of support, 
in accordance with the procedures set forth in Sec. 303.104 of this 
chapter;
    (7) Procedures for making information regarding the amount of 
overdue support owed by an absent parent available to consumer reporting 
agencies, in accordance with Sec. 303.105 of this chapter;
    (8) Procedures under which all child support orders which are issued 
or modified in the State will include provision for withholding from 
wages, in order to assure that withholding as a

[[Page 223]]

means of collecting child support is available if arrearages occur 
without the necessity of filing an application for services under 
Sec. 302.33 of this part, in accordance with Sec. 303.100(i) of this 
chapter;
    (9) Procedures which require that any payment or installment of 
support under any child support order, whether ordered through the State 
judicial system or through the expedited processes required by paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section, is (on and after the date it is due):
    (i) A judgment by operation of law, with the full force, effect, and 
attributes of a judgment of the State, including the ability to be 
enforced;
    (ii) Entitled as a judgment to full faith and credit in such State 
and in any other State; and
    (iii) Not subject to retroactive modification by such State or by 
any other State, except as provided in Sec. 303.106(b).
    (10) Procedures for the review and adjustment of child support 
orders:
    (i) Effective on October 13, 1990 until October 12, 1993, in 
accordance with the requirements of Sec. 303.8 (a) and (b) of this 
chapter; and
    (ii) Effective October 13, 1993, or an earlier date the State may 
select, in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 303.8 (a) and (c) 
through (f) of this chapter.
    (11) Procedures under which the State must give full faith and 
credit to a determination of paternity made by any other State, whether 
established through voluntary acknowledgment or through administrative 
or judicial processes.
    (b) A State need not apply a procedure required under paragraphs (a) 
(3), (4), (6) and (7) of this section in an individual case if the State 
determines that it is not appropriate using guidelines generally 
available to the public which take into account the payment record of 
the absent parent, the availability of other remedies, and other 
relevant considerations. The guidelines may not determine a majority of 
cases in which no other remedy is being used to be inappropriate.
    (c) State laws enacted under this section must give States 
sufficient authority to comply with the requirements of Secs. 303.100 
through 303.105 of this chapter.
    (d)(1) Exemption. A State may apply for an exemption from any of the 
requirements of paragraph (a) of this section by the submittal of a 
request for exemption to the appropriate Regional Office.
    (2) Basis for granting exemption. The Secretary will grant a State, 
or political subdivision in the case of paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section, an exemption from any of the requirements of paragraph (a) of 
this section for a period not to exceed three years if the State 
demonstrates that compliance would not increase the effectiveness and 
efficiency of its Child Support Enforcement program. Demonstration of 
the program's efficiency and effectiveness must be shown by actual, or, 
if actual is not available, estimated data pertaining to caseloads, 
processing times, administrative costs, and average support collections 
or such other actual or estimated data as the Office may request. The 
State must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the 
program's effectiveness would not improve by using these procedures. 
Disapproval of a request for exemption is not subject to appeal.
    (3) Review of exemption. The exemption is subject to continuing 
review by the Secretary and may be terminated upon a change in 
circumstances or reduced effectiveness in the State or political 
subdivision, if the State cannot demonstrate that the changed 
circumstances continue to warrant an exemption in accordance with this 
section.
    (4) Request for extension. The State must request an extension of 
the exemption by submitting current data in accordance with paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section 90 days prior to the end of the exemption period 
granted under paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
    (5) When an exemption is revoked or an extension is denied. If the 
Secretary revokes an exemption or does not grant an extension of an 
exemption, the State must enact the appropriate laws and procedures to 
implement the mandatory practice by the beginning of the fourth month 
after the end of the first regular, special, budget or other session of 
the State's legislature which ends after the date the exemption is 
revoked or the extension is denied. If no

[[Page 224]]

State law is necessary, the State must establish and be using the 
procedure by the beginning of the fourth month after the date the 
exemption is revoked.

waiver if a

[[Page 225]]

State demonstrates that it has an alternative approach to APD 
requirements or an alternative system configuration, as defined in

part 305 of this chapter, to be in substantial compliance with all other 
requirements of this chapter; and either:
    (i) The waiver request meets the criteria set forth in section 
1115(c)(1), (2) and (3) of the Act; or

Sec. 303.3  Location of absent parents.

    (a) Definition. Location means information concerning the physical 
whereabouts of the absent parent, or the absent parent's employer(s),

and necessary to take the next appropriate action in a case.
    (b) For all cases referred to the IV-D agency or applying for 
services under Sec. 302.33 of this chapter, the IV-D agency must attempt 
to locate all absent parents or sources of income and/or assets when 
location is necessary to take necessary action. Under this standard, the 
IV-D agency must:
    (1) Use appropriate location sources such as the Federal PLS; 
interstate location networks; local officials and employees 
administering public assistance, general assistance, medical assistance, 
food stamps and social services (whether such individuals are employed 
by the State or a political subdivision); relatives and friends of the 
absent parent; current or past employers; the local telephone company; 
the U.S. Postal Service; financial references; unions; fraternal 
organizations; and police, parole, and probation records if appropriate; 
and State agencies and departments, as authorized by State law, 
including those departments which maintain records of public assistance,

licenses, vehicle registration, and criminal records;
    (2) Establish working relationships with all appropriate agencies in 
order to utilize locate resources effectively;
    (3) Within no more than 75 calendar days of determining that 
location is necessary, access all appropriate location sources, 
including transmitting appropriate cases to the Federal PLS, and ensure 
that location information is sufficient to take the next appropriate 
action in a case;
    (4) Refer appropriate cases to the IV-D agency of any other State, 
in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 303.7 of this part. The IV-D 
agency of such other State shall follow the procedures in paragraphs 
(b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section for such cases, as necessary, 
except that the responding State is not required to access the Federal 
PLS under paragraph (b)(3) of this section;
    (5) Repeat location attempts in cases in which previous attempts to 
locate absent parents or sources of income and/or assets have failed, 
but adequate identifying and other information exists to meet 
requirements for submittal for location, either quarterly or immediately 
upon receipt of new information which may aid in location, whichever 
occurs sooner. Quarterly attempts may be limited to automated sources 
but must include accessing State employment security files. Repeated 
attempts because of new information which may aid in location must meet

[[Page 227]]

the requirements of paragraph (b)(3) of this section; and
    (c) The State must establish guidelines defining diligent efforts to 
serve process. These guidelines must include periodically repeating 
service of process attempts in cases in which previous attempts to serve 
process have failed, but adequate identifying and other information 
exists to attempt service of process.

    (d) Within 90 calendar days of locating the alleged father or 
noncustodial parent, regardless of whether paternity has been 
established, establish an order for support or complete service of 
process necessary to commence proceedings to establish a support order 
and, if necessary, paternity (or document unsuccessful attempts to serve 
process, in accordance with the State's guidelines defining diligent 
efforts under Sec. 303.3(c)).
    (e) If the court or administrative authority dismisses a petition 
for a support order without prejudice, the IV-D agency must, at the time 
of dismissal, examine the reasons for dismissal and determine when it 
would be appropriate to seek an order in the future, and seek a support 
order at that time.
    (f) Seek a support order based on a voluntary acknowledgment in 
accordance with Sec. 302.70(a)(5)(vii).

<R05>
Sec. 303.5  Establishment of paternity.

    (a) For all cases referred to the IV-D agency or applying for 
services under Sec. 302.33 of this chapter in which paternity has not 
been established, the IV-D agency must, as appropriate:
    (1) Provide an alleged father the opportunity to voluntarily 
acknowledge paternity in accordance with Sec. 302.70(a)(5)(iii); and
    (2) Attempt to establish paternity by legal process established 
under State law.
    (b) The IV-D agency need not attempt to establish paternity in any 
case involving incest or forcible rape, or in any case in which legal 
proceedings for adoption are pending, if, in the opinion of the IV-D 
agency, it would not be in the best interests of the child to establish 
paternity.
    (c) The IV-D agency must identify and use through competitive 
procurement laboratories which perform, at reasonable cost, legally and 
medically acceptable genetic tests which tend to identify the father or 
exclude the alleged father. The IV-D agency must make available a list 
of such laboratories to appropriate courts and law enforcement 
officials, and to the public upon request.
    (d)(1) Upon the request of any party in a contested paternity case, 
the IV-D agency, if the agency lacks the authority to order such tests, 
shall petition the court or administrative authority to require all 
parties to submit to genetic tests unless, in the case of an individual 
receiving aid under the State's title IV-A or XIX plan, there has been a 
determination of good cause for refusal to cooperate under Secs. 232.40 
through 232.49 of this title or 42 CFR 433.147, respectively, or if, in 
accordance with Sec. 303.5(b), the IV-D agency has determined that it 
would not be in the best interest of the child to establish paternity in 
a case involving incest or forcible rape, or in any case in which legal 
proceedings for adoption are pending.
    (2) A contested paternity case is any legal action in which the 
issue of paternity may be raised under State law and one party denies 
paternity.
    (e)(1) The IV-D agency may charge any individual who is not a 
recipient of aid under the State's title IV-A or XIX

[[Page 228]]

plan a reasonable fee for performing genetic tests.
    (2) Any fee charged must be reasonable so as not to discourage those 
in need of paternity establishment services from seeking them and may 
not exceed the actual costs of the genetic tests.
    (3) If paternity is established and genetic tests were performed, 
the IV-D agency must attempt to obtain a judgment for the costs of the 
genetic tests from the party who denied paternity or, at State option, 
from each party so long as the total amount requested does not exceed 
the actual costs of the genetic tests.
    (4) The IV-D agency must use any amount collected under paragraphs 
(e) (1) and (3) of this section that exceeds the costs of performing 
genetic tests to reimburse any fee paid under paragraph (e)(1) of this 
chapter.
    (f) The IV-D agency must seek entry of a default order by the court 
or administrative authority in a paternity case by showing that process 
has been served on the defendant in accordance with State law, that the 
defendant has failed to respond to service in accordance with State 
procedures, and any additional showing required by State law, in 
accordance with Sec. 302.70(a)(5)(viii).
    (g) Hospital-based program.
    (1) The State must establish, in cooperation with hospitals, a 
hospital-based program in every public and private birthing hospital. 
These programs must be operational in birthing hospitals statewide no 
later than January 1, 1995 (unless Federal law governing the effective 
date gives the State additional time).
    (2) During the period immediately before or after the birth of a 
child to an unmarried woman in the hospital, a hospital-based program 
must, at a minimum:
    (i) Provide to both the mother and alleged father, if he is present 
in the hospital:
    (A) Written materials about paternity establishment,
    (B) the forms necessary to voluntarily acknowledge paternity,
    (C) a written description of the rights and responsibilities of 
acknowledging paternity, and
    (D) the opportunity to speak with staff, either by telephone or in 
person, who are trained to clarify information and answer questions 
about paternity establishment;
    (ii) Provide the mother and alleged father, if he is present, the 
opportunity to voluntarily acknowledge paternity in the hospital;
    (iii) Afford due process safeguards; and
    (iv) Forward completed acknowledgments or copies to the entity 
designated under Sec. 303.5(g)(8).
    (3) A hospital-based program need not provide services specified in 
paragraph (g)(2) of this section in cases where the mother or alleged 
father is a minor or a legal action is already pending, if the provision 
of such services is precluded by State law.
    (4) The State must require that a voluntary acknowledgment obtained 
through a hospital-based program be signed by both parents, and that the 
parents' signatures be authenticated by a notary or witness(es).
    (5) The State must provide to all public and private birthing 
hospitals in the State:
    (i) written materials about paternity establishment,
    (ii) forms necessary to voluntarily acknowledge paternity, and
    (iii) copies of a written description of the rights and 
responsibilities of acknowledging paternity.
    (6) The State must provide training, guidance, and written 
instructions regarding voluntary acknowledgment of paternity, as 
necessary to operate the hospital-based program.
    (7) The State must assess each birthing hospital's program on at 
least an annual basis.
    (8) The State must designate an entity to which hospital-based 
programs must forward completed voluntary acknowledgments or copies in 
accordance with Sec. 303.5(g)(2)(iv). Under State procedures, this 
entity must be responsible for promptly recording identifying 
information about the acknowledgments with a statewide database, and the 
IV-D agency must have timely access to whatever identifying information 
and documentation it needs to determine in accordance with Sec. 303.5(h) 
if an acknowledgment has been recorded and

[[Page 229]]

to seek a support order on the basis of a recorded acknowledgment in 
accordance with Sec. 303.4(f).
    (h) In IV-D cases needing paternity establishment, the IV-D agency 
must determine if identifying information about a voluntary 
acknowledgment has been recorded in the statewide database in accordance 
with Sec. 303.5(g)(8).

Sec. 303.6  Enforcement of support obligations.

    For all cases referred to the IV-D agency or applying for services 
under Sec. 302.33 in which the obligation to support and the amount of 
the obligation have been established, the IV-D agency must maintain and 
use an effective system for:
    (a) Monitoring compliance with the support obligation;
    (b) Identifying on the date the parent fails to make payments in an 
amount equal to the support payable for one month, or on an earlier date 
in accordance with State law, those cases in which there is a failure to 
comply with the support obligation; and
    (c) Enforcing the obligation by:
    (1) Initiating income withholding, in accordance with Sec. 303.100;
    (2) Taking any appropriate enforcement action (except income 
withholding and Federal and State income tax refund offset) unless 
service of process is necessary, within no more than 30 calendar days of 
identifying a delinquency or other support-related non-compliance with 
the order or the location of the absent parent, whichever occurs later. 
If service of process is necessary prior to taking an enforcement 
action, service must be completed (or unsuccessful attempts to serve 
process must be documented in accordance with the State's guidelines 
defining diligent efforts under Sec. 303.3(c)), and enforcement action 
taken if process is served, within no later than 60 calendar days of 
identifying a delinquency or other support-related non-compliance with 
the order, or the location of the absent parent, whichever occurs later;
    (3) Submitting once a year all cases which meet the certification 
requirements under Sec. 303.102 of this part and State guidelines 
developed under Sec. 302.70(b) of this title for State income tax refund 
offset, and which meet the certification requirements under Sec. 303.72 
of this part for Federal income tax refund offset; and
    (4) In cases in which enforcement attempts have been unsuccessful, 
at the time an attempt to enforce fails, examining the reason the 
enforcement attempt failed and determining when it would be appropriate 
to take an enforcement action in the future, and taking an enforcement 
action in accordance with the requirements of this section at that time.

    (4) The central registry must respond to inquiries from other States 
within 5 working days of receipt of the request for a case status 
review.
    (b) Initiating State IV-D agency responsibilities. The IV-D agency 
must:
    (1) If the State has a long-arm statute which allows paternity 
establishment, use the authority to establish paternity whenever

    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, within 
20 calendar days of determining that the absent parent is in another 
State, and, if appropriate, receipt of any necessary information needed

    (4) Within 75 calendar days of receipt of an Interstate Child 
Support Enforcement Transmittal Form, a URESA Action Request Form or 
other alternative State form and documentation from its interstate 
central registry, the IV-D agency must:
    (i) Provide location services in accordance with Sec. 303.3 of this 
part if the request is for location services or the form or 
documentation does not include adequate location information on the 
absent parent;
    (ii) If unable to proceed with the case because of inadequate 
documentation, notify the IV-D agency in the initiating State of the 
necessary additions or corrections to the form or documentation.
    (iii) If the documentation received with a case is inadequate and 
cannot be remedied by the responding IV-D agency without the assistance 
of the initiating State, the IV-D agency must process the interstate IV-
D case to the extent possible pending necessary action by the initiating 
State.

[[Page 231]]

    (5) Within 10 working days of locating the absent parent in a 
different jurisdiction within the State, the IV-D agency must forward 
the form and documentation to the appropriate jurisdiction and notify 
the initiating State and central registry of its action.
    (6) Within 10 working days of locating the absent parent in a 
different State, the IV-D agency must--
    (i) Return the form and documentation, including the new location,

of collection as defined under Sec. 302.51(a) of this chapter or that 
the payments were made through State income tax refund offset, and 
include the responding State's identifying code as defined in the 
Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS) issued by

not exceed the actual costs of the genetic tests, and, if costs of 
genetic testing are recovered, must reimburse the initiating State.
    (4) Each IV-D agency may recover its costs of providing services in 
interstate non-AFDC cases in accordance with Sec. 302.33(d) of this 
chapter.
    (5) The IV-D agency in the responding State must identify any fees

Sec. 303.8  Review and adjustment of child support orders.

    (a) Definitions. For purposes of this section:
    (1) Adjustment applies only to the child support provisions of the 
order, and means:
    (i) An upward or downward change in the amount of child support 
based upon an application of State guidelines for setting and adjusting 
child support awards; and/or
    (ii) Provision for the child's health care needs, through health 
insurance coverage or other means.
    (2) Parent includes any custodial parent or non-custodial parent (or 
for purposes of requesting a review, any other person or entity who may 
have standing to request an adjustment to the child support order).
    (3) Review means an objective evaluation, conducted through a 
proceeding before a court, quasi-judicial process, or administrative 
body or agency, of information necessary for application of the State's 
guidelines for support to determine:
    (i) The appropriate support award amount; and
    (ii) The need to provide for the child's health care needs in the 
order through health insurance coverage or other means.
    (b) Plan for review and adjustment. (1) Effective on October 13, 
1990, the State must have a written and publicly available plan 
indicating how and when child support orders in effect in the State will 
be periodically reviewed and adjusted.
    (2) During the period from October 13, 1990 through October 12, 
1993, the State must, for orders being enforced under this chapter:
    (i) Determine whether such orders should be reviewed, using the plan 
specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section;
    (ii) Initiate a review, in accordance with the plan, at the request 
of either parent subject to the order or of a IV-D agency;
    (iii) Notify each parent subject to a child support order of any 
review of the order at least 30 calendar days before commencement of the 
review;
    (iv) Adjust the order when the review determines that there should 
be a change in the child support award amount, or that health insurance 
should be required, as indicated by the review in accordance with the 
State's guidelines for support described in Sec. 302.56 of this chapter.
    (v) Following any review, notify each parent subject to a child 
support order in effect in the State, of:
    (A) Any adjustment or a determination that there should be no change 
in the order; and
    (B) Each parent's right to initiate proceedings to challenge the 
adjustment or determination, either through pre-decision review, appeal, 
or administrative review, within at least 30 calendar days after the 
date of the notice.

    (c) Review of child support orders. Effective October 13, 1993 or an 
earlier date the State may select, the State must, when providing 
services under this chapter:
    (1) Have in effect and use a process for review and adjustment of 
child support orders in effect in the State, including a process for 
challenging a proposed adjustment or determination.
    (2) Notify each parent subject to a child support order in the State 
of the right to request a review of the order, and the appropriate place 
and manner in which the request should be made.
    (3) Periodically publicize the right to request a review as part of 
its support enforcement services as required under Sec. 302.30 of this 
chapter and include notice of this right as part of information on IV-D 
services under Sec. 303.2(a)(2) of this part.
    (4) Review child support orders at 36-month intervals after 
establishment of the order or the most recent review, unless:
    (i) In a case in which there is an assignment as defined in 
Sec. 301.1 of this chapter, the State determines, in accordance with 
Sec. 303.8(c)(5) of this section, that a review would not be in the best 
interests of the child and neither parent has requested a review; or
    (ii) In a case in which there is no such assignment of support 
rights to the State, neither parent has requested a review; or
    (iii) In a case in which medical support rights are assigned under 
42 CFR 433.146, but child support rights are not assigned to the State 
under Sec. 232.11 of

[[Page 233]]

this title or Sec. 471(a)(17) of the Act, the order requires the 
provision of health insurance coverage, and neither parent has requested 
a review; or
    (5) Determine that a review of the child support order would not be 
in the best interests of a child if there has been a finding of good 
cause as set forth at Secs. 302.31(c) and 232.40 through 232.49 of this 
title or under 42 CFR 433.147(c), and the State or local IV-A, XIX, or 
IV-E agency has determined that support enforcement may not proceed 
without risk of harm to the child or caretaker relative.
    (6) Notify or serve process upon each parent subject to a child 
support order in effect in the State of:
    (i) Any review of such order at least 30 calendar days before 
commencement of the review, and
    (ii) Any information necessary to conduct the review that each 
parent must provide and the date by which such information must be 
provided.
    (7) Following any review, notify each parent subject to the child 
support order of:
    (i) A proposed adjustment or a determination that there should be no 
adjustment in the order; and
    (ii) Each parent's right to initiate proceedings to challenge the 
proposed adjustment or other determination, not less than 30 calendar 
days after the notice.
    (8) Adjust the order, or determine that there should be no 
adjustment, as appropriate, in accordance with the State's guidelines 
for setting child support awards and paragraph (d) of this section.
    (d) Basis for seeking adjustment. (1) Inconsistency between the 
existent child support award amount and the amount of child support 
which results from application of the State guidelines must be an 
adequate basis, under State law, for petitioning for an adjustment of an 
order in a IV-D case, unless:
    (i) the inconsistency does not meet a reasonable quantitative 
standard established by the State, in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) 
of this section or
    (ii) the inconsistency is due to the fact that the amount of the 
current child support award resulted from a rebuttal of the guideline 
amount and there has not been a change in the circumstances which 
resulted in the rebuttal of the guideline amount.
    (2) The State may establish a reasonable quantitative standard based 
upon either a fixed dollar amount or percentage, or both, as a basis for 
determining whether an inconsistency between the existent child support 
award amount and the amount of support which results from application of 
the guidelines is adequate grounds for petitioning for adjustment of the 
order.
    (3) The need to provide for the child's health care needs in the 
order, through health insurance or other means, must be an adequate 
basis under State law to petition for adjustment of an order to provide 
for the children's health care needs, regardless of whether an 
adjustment in the amount of child support is necessary. In no event 
shall the eligibility for or receipt of Medicaid be considered to meet 
the need to provide for the child's health care needs in the order.
    (e) Timeframes for review and adjustment. (1) In any case in which 
support rights are assigned to the State under Sec. 301.1 of this part, 
the State must determine, within 15 calendar days of October 13, 1993 or 
the date the child support order is 36 months old, whichever date occurs 
later, whether a review should be conducted, as required under paragraph 
(c)(4) of this section. Subsequent determinations about whether to 
conduct a review must be made in accordance with paragraph (c)(4) of 
this section, at 36-month intervals based upon the date the child 
support order was adjusted or the date an order was entered determining 
that the child support order should not be adjusted, or, in any case in 
which a petition or motion for adjustment was not filed following a 
review, the date upon which the post-review challenge period ended.
    (2) Within 15 calendar days of receipt of a request for a review, 
the State must determine whether a review should be conducted, as 
required under paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
    (3) Within 180 calendar days of determining that a review should be 
conducted or locating the non-requesting parent, whichever occurs later, 
a State must:
    (i) Send the notice or serve process required under paragraph (c)(6) 
of this

[[Page 234]]

section that a review will be conducted;
    (ii) Conduct a review of the order;
    (iii) Send the notice of the proposed adjustment or determination 
that there should be no adjustment as required under paragraph (c)(7) of 
this section; and
    (iv) Adjust the order or determine that the order should not be 
adjusted in accordance with paragraph (c)(8) of this section.
    (f) Interstate review and adjustment. Effective October 13, 1993, or 
such earlier date the State may select:
    (1) Initiating State responsibilities. The State in which a request 
for review is made, or in which there is an assignment of rights to 
support, as defined under Sec. 301.1 of this part, must:
    (i) In any case in which support rights are assigned to the State 
under Sec. 301.1, determine, within 15 calendar days of October 13, 
1993, or the date the child support order is 36 months old, whichever 
date occurs later, whether a review should be conducted, as required 
under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, and in which State a review and 
adjustment will be sought. Subsequent determinations about whether to 
conduct a review must be made in accordance with paragraph (c)(4) of 
this section, at 36-month intervals based upon the date the child 
support order was adjusted or the date an order was entered determining 
that the child support order should not be adjusted, or, in any case in 
which a petition or motion for adjustment was not filed following a 
review, the date upon which the post-review challenge period ended.
    (ii) Within 15 calendar days of receipt of a request for a review, 
determine whether a review should be conducted, as required under 
paragraph (c)(4) of this section, and in which State a review and 
adjustment will be sought.
    (iii) If the State determines under paragraph (f)(1)(i) or paragraph 
(f)(1)(ii) of this section that it should review a child support order 
in effect in the State, the State shall, within the 180-calendar-day 
timeframe for review and adjustment of child support orders set forth in 
paragraph (e)(2) of this section, send the notice that a review will be 
conducted to each parent, conduct a review, provide notice to the 
parties of the right to challenge the proposed adjustment or other 
determination, and adjust the order or determine that the order should 
not be adjusted, in accordance with paragraphs (c) (6) through (8) of 
this section.
    (iv) If the State determines under paragraph (f)(1)(i) or paragraph 
(f)(1)(ii) of this section to request a review of a child support order 
in another State, send a request for review to that State within 20 
calendar days of receipt of sufficient information to conduct the review 
and provide that State with sufficient information on the requestor to 
act on the request, in accordance with the requirements of 
Sec. 303.7(b)(6) of this part.
    (v) If the request for review is the first contact between the 
initiating and responding States in the case, send the request for 
review to the interstate central registry in the responding State. 
However, if the initiating State has previously referred the case to a 
responding State for action and determines under paragraph (f)(1)(i) or 
paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section that the child support order should 
be reviewed in that responding State, the request for review may be sent 
directly to the appropriate agency in the responding State for 
processing.
    (vi) Send, to the parent in the initiating State, a copy of any 
notice issued by a responding State in connection with the review and 
adjustment of an order, within 5 working days of receipt of such notice 
in the initiating State.
    (2) Responding State responsibilities. (i) Within 15 calendar days 
of receipt of a request for a review of a child support order in the 
responding State, the appropriate processing agency in the responding 
State must determine whether a review should be conducted, in accordance 
with paragraph (c)(4) of this section and the responding State's 
procedures for review and adjustment of child support orders.
    (ii) Within 180 calendar days of determining that a review should be 
conducted or locating the non-requesting parent, whichever occurs later, 
the responding State must send the notice that a review will be 
conducted to each parent, conduct a review, adjust the order or 
determine that the order should not be adjusted, and provide the

[[Page 235]]

notice of the adjustment or determination and the right to challenge the 
adjustment or determination in accordance with paragraphs (c) (6) 
through (8) of this section.
    (iii) The State may meet the notice requirements of Sec. 303.7(c)(8) 
of this part by sending the notices of the review required under 
paragraphs (c)(6) and (c)(7) of this section to the parent in the 
initiating State through the IV-D agency in the initiating State.
    (3) Applicable laws and procedures. The applicable laws and 
procedures for review and adjustment of child support orders, including 
the State guidelines for setting child support awards, established in 
accordance with Sec. 302.56 of this chapter, are those of the State in 
which the review and adjustment, or determination that there be no 
adjustment, take place.

Sec. 303.10  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 303.11  Case closure criteria.

    (a) The IV-D agency shall establish a system for case closure.
    (b) In order to be eligible for closure, the case must meet at least 
one of the following criteria:
    (1) In the case of a child who has reached the age of majority, 
there is no longer a current support order and arrearages are under $500 
or unenforceable under State law;
    (2) In the case of a child who has not reached the age of majority, 
there is no longer a current support order and arrearages are under $500 
or unenforceable under State law;
    (3) The absent parent or putative father is deceased and no further 
action, including a levy against the estate, can be taken;
    (4) Paternity cannot be established because:
    (i) The child is at least 18 years old and action to establish 
paternity is barred by a statute of limitations which meets the 
requirements of Sec. 302.70(a)(5) of this chapter;
    (ii) A genetic test or a court or administrative process has 
excluded the putative father and no other putative father can be 
identified; or
    (iii) In accordance with Sec. 303.5(b) of this part, the IV-D agency 
has determined that it would not be in the best interests of the child 
to establish paternity in a case involving incest or forcible rape, or 
in any case where legal proceedings for adoption are pending;
    (5) The absent parent's location is unknown, and the State has made 
regular attempts using multiple sources to locate the absent parent over 
a three-year period, all of which have been unsuccessful;
    (6) The absent parent cannot pay support for the duration of the 
child's minority because the parent has been institutionalized in a 
psychiatric facility, is incarcerated with no chance for parole, or has 
a medically-verified total and permanent disability with no evidence of 
support potential. The State must also determine that no income or 
assets are available to the absent parent which could be levied or 
attached for support;
    (7) The absent parent is a citizen of, and lives in, a foreign 
country, does not work for the Federal government or a company with 
headquarters or offices in the United States, and has no reachable 
domestic income or assets; and the State has been unable to establish 
reciprocity with the country;
    (8) The IV-D agency has provided location-only services as requested 
under Sec. 302.35(c)(3) of this chapter;
    (9) The non-AFDC custodial parent requests closure of a case and 
there is no assignment to the State of medical support under 42 CFR 
433.146 or of arrearages which accrued under a support order;
    (10) There has been a finding of good cause as set forth at 
Sec. 302.31(c) and either Secs. 232.40 through 232.49 of this chapter or 
42 CFR 433.147 and the State or local IV-A, IV-E, or Medicaid agency has 
determined that support enforcement may not proceed without risk of harm 
to the child or caretaker relative;
    (11) In a non-AFDC case receiving services under Sec. 302.33(a)(1) 
(i) or (iii), the IV-D agency is unable to contact the custodial parent 
within a 30 calendar day period despite attempts by both phone and at 
least one certified letter; or

[[Page 236]]

    (12) In a non-AFDC case receiving services under Sec. 302.33(a)(1) 
(i) or (iii), the IV-D agency documents the circumstances of the 
custodial parent's noncooperation and an action by the custodial parent 
is essential for the next step in providing IV-D services.
    (c) In cases meeting the criteria in paragraphs (b) (1) through (7) 
and (11) and (12) of this section, the State must notify the custodial 
parent in writing 60 calendar days prior to closure of the case of the 
State's intent to close the case. The case must be kept open if the 
custodial parent supplies information in response to the notice which 
could lead to the establishment of paternity or a support order or

    (a) Past-due support qualifying for offset. Past-due support as 
defined in Sec. 301.1 of this chapter qualifies for offset if:
    (1) There has been an assignment of the support rights under 
Sec. 232.11 of this title or section 471(a)(17) of the Act to the State 
making the request for offset or the IV-D agency is providing services 
under Sec. 302.33 of this chapter.
    (2) For support which has been assigned to the State under 
Sec. 232.11 of this title or section 471(a)(17) of the Act:
    (i) The amount of the support is not less than $150; and
    (ii) The support has been delinquent for three months or longer.
    (3) For support owed in cases where the IV-D agency is providing IV-
D services under Sec. 302.33 of this chapter:
    (i) The support is owed to or on behalf of a qualified child, or a 
qualified child and the parent with whom the child is living if the same 
support order includes support for the child and the parent.
    (ii) The amount of support is not less than $500;
    (iii) At State option, the amount has accrued since the State IV-D 
agency began to enforce the support order; and
    (iv) The State has checked its records to determine if an AFDC or 
foster care maintenance assigned arrearage exists with respect to the 
non-AFDC individual or family.
    (4) The IV-D agency has in its records:
    (i) A copy of the order and any modifications upon which the amount 
referred is based which specify the date of issuance and amount of 
support;
    (ii) A copy of the payment record, or, if there is no payment 
record, an affidavit signed by the custodial parent attesting to the 
amount of support owed; and
    (iii) In non-AFDC cases, the custodial parent's current address.
    (5) Before submittal, the State IV-D agency has verified the 
accuracy of the name and social security number of the absent parent and 
the accuracy of the past-due support amount. If the State IV-D agency 
has verified this information previously, it need not reverify it.
    (6) A notification of liability for past-due support has been 
received by the Secretary of the Treasury as prescribed by paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section.
    (b) Notification to OCSE of liability for past-due support. (1) A 
State IV-D agency shall submit a notification (or notifications) of 
liability for past-due support on a magnetic tape to the Office by the 
submittal date specified by the Office in instructions.
    (2) The notification of liability for past-due support shall contain 
with respect to each delinquency:
    (i) The name of the taxpayer who owes the past-due support;
    (ii) The social security number of that taxpayer;
    (iii) The amount of past-due support owed;
    (iv) The State codes as contained in the Federal Information 
Processing Standards (FIPS) publication of the National Bureau of 
Standards and also promulgated by the General Services Administration in 
Worldwide Geographical Location Codes; and
    (v) Whether the past-due support is due an individual who applied 
for services under Sec. 302.33 of this chapter.
    (3) The notification of liability for past-due support may contain 
with respect to each delinquency the taxpayer's IV-D case number and 
FIPS code for the local IV-D agency where the case originated.
    (c) Review of requests by the Office. (1) The Deputy Director will 
review each

[[Page 244]]

request to determine whether it meets the requirements of this section.
    (2) If a request meets all requirements, the Deputy Director will 
transmit the request to the Secretary of the Treasury and will notify 
the State IV-D agency in writing of the transmittal.
    (3) If a request does not meet all requirements, the Deputy Director 
will attempt to correct the request in consultation with the State IV-D 
agency.
    (4) If a request cannot be corrected through consultation, the 
Deputy Director will return it to the State IV-D agency with a written 
explanation of why the request could not be transmitted to the Secretary 
of the Treasury.
    (d) Notification of changes in case status. (1) The State referring 
past-due support of offset must, in interstate situations, notify any 
other State involved in enforcing the support order when it submits an 
interstate case for offset and when it receives the offset amount from 
the IRS.
    (2) The State IV-D agency shall within time frames established by 
the Office in instructions, notify the Deputy Director in writing of any 
deletion of an amount referred for collection by Federal tax refund 
offset or any decrease in the amount if the decrease is significant 
according to guidelines developed by the State. The notification shall 
contain the information specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (e) Notices of offset--(1) Advance. The State IV-D agency, or the 
Office, if the State requests and the Office agrees, shall send a 
written advance notice to inform an absent parent that the amount of his 
or her past-due support will be referred to the IRS for collection by 
Federal tax refund offset. The notice must inform absent parents:
    (i) Of their right to contest the State's determination that past-
due support is owed or the amount of past-due support;
    (ii) Of their right to an administrative review by the submitting 
State or at the absent parent's request the State with the order upon 
which the referral for offset is based;
    (iii) Of the procedures and timeframe for contacting the IV-D agency 
in the submitting State to request administrative review; and
    (iv) That, in the case of a joint return, the IRS will notify the 
absent parent's spouse at the time of offset regarding the steps to take 
to protect the share of the refund which may be payable to that spouse. 
If the IV-D agency sends the notice, it must meet the conditions 
specified by the Office in instructions.
    (2) At offset. The IRS will notify the absent parent that the offset 
has been made. The IRS will also notify any individual who filed a joint 
return with the absent parent of the steps to take in order to secure a 
proper share of the refund.
    (f) Procedures for contesting in intrastate cases. (1) Upon receipt 
of a complaint from an absent parent in response to the advance notice 
required in paragraph (e)(1) of this section or concerning a tax refund 
which has already been offset, the IV-D agency must send a notice to the 
absent parent and, in non-AFDC cases the custodial parent, of the time 
and place of the administrative review of the complaint and conduct the 
review to determine the validity of the complaint.
    (2) If the complaint concerns a joint tax refund that has not yet 
been offset, the IV-D agency must inform the absent parent that the IRS 
will notify the absent parent's spouse at the time of offset regarding 
the steps to take to secure his or her proper share of the refund. If 
the complaint concerns a joint tax refund which has already been offset, 
the IV-D agency must refer the absent parent to the IRS.
    (3) If the administrative review results in a deletion of, or 
decrease in, the amount referred for offset, the IV-D agency must notify 
OCSE in writing within time frames established by the Office and include 
the information specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (4) If, as a result of the administrative review, an amount which 
has already been offset is found to have exceeded the amount of past-due 
support owed, the IV-D agency must take steps to refund the excess 
amount to the absent parent promptly.
    (g) Procedures for contesting in interstate cases. (1) If the absent 
parent requests an administrative review in the submitting State, the 
IV-D agency

[[Page 245]]

must meet the requirements in paragraph (f) of this section.
    (2) If the complaint cannot be resolved by the submitting State and 
the absent parent requests an administrative review in the State with 
the order upon which the referral for offset is based, the submitting 
State must notify the State with the order of the request for an 
administrative review and provide that State with all necessary 
information, including the information listed under paragraph (a)(4) of 
this section, within 10 days of the absent parent's request for an 
administrative review.
    (3) The State with the order must send a notice to the absent parent 
and, in non-AFDC cases the custodial parent, of the time and place of 
the administrative review, conduct the review and make a decision within 
45 days of receipt of the notice and information from the submitting 
State.
    (4) If the administrative review results in a deletion of, or 
decrease in, the amount referred for offset, the State with the order 
must notify the Office in writing within time frames established by the 
Office and include the information specified in paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (5) Upon resolution of a complaint after an offset has been made, 
the State with the order must notify the submitting State of its 
decision promptly.
    (6) When an administrative review is conducted in the State with the 
order, the submitting State is bound by the decision made by the State 
with the order.
    (7) Based on the decision of the State with the order, the IV-D 
agency in the submitting State must take steps to refund any excess 
amount to the absent parent promptly.
    (8) In computing incentives under Sec. 304.12 of this part, if the 
case is referred to the State with the order for an administrative 
review, the collections made as a result of Federal tax refund offset 
will be treated as having been collected in full by both the submitting 
State and the State with the order.
    (h) Distribution of collections. (1) Collections received by the IV-
D agency as a result of refund offset to satisfy AFDC or non-AFDC past-
due support shall be distributed as past-due support as required under 
Sec. 302.51(b) (4) and (5) and (e) of this chapter.
    (2) Collections received by the IV-D agency in foster care 
maintenance cases shall be distributed as past-due support under 
Sec. 302.52(b) (3) and (4) of this chapter.
    (3) The IV-D agency must inform individuals receiving services under 
Sec. 302.33 of this chapter in advance that amounts offset will be 
applied first to satisfy any past-due support which has been assigned to 
the State under Sec. 232.11 of this title, 42 CFR 433.146, or section 
471(a)(17) of the Act and submitted for Federal tax refund offset.
    (4) If the amount collected is in excess of the amounts required to 
be distributed under Sec. 302.51 (b) (4) and (5) and (e) or 
Sec. 302.52(b) (3) and (4) of this chapter, the IV-D agency must repay 
the excess to the absent parent whose refund was offset or to the 
parties filing a joint return within a reasonable period in accordance 
with State law.
    (5) In cases where the Secretary of the Treasury, through OCSE, 
notifies the State that an offset is being made to satisfy non-AFDC 
past-due support from a refund based on a joint return, the State may 
delay distribution until notified that the unobligated spouse's proper 
share of the refund has been paid or for a period not to exceed six 
months from notification of offset, whichever is earlier.
    (6) Collections from offset may be applied only against the past-due 
support which was specified in the advance notice described in paragraph 
(e)(1) of this section.
    (i) Payment of fee. (1) A refund offset fee, in such amount as the 
Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Health and Human Services 
have agreed to be sufficient to reimburse the IRS for the full cost of 
the offset procedure, shall be deducted from the offset amount and 
credited to the IRS appropriations which bore all or part of the costs 
involved in making the collection. The full amount offset must be 
credited against the obligor's payment record. The fee which the 
Secretary of the Treasury may impose with respect to non-AFDC submittals 
shall not exceed $25 per submittal.

[[Page 246]]

    (2) The State IV-D agency may charge an individual who is receiving 
services under Sec. 302.33(a)(1) (i) or (iii) of this chapter a fee not 
to exceed $25 for submitting past-due support for Federal tax refund 
offset. The State must inform the individual in advance of the amount of 
any fee charged.
    (3) Any State which requests the Office to send the advance written 
notice under paragraph (e)(1) of this section will be charged a fee, in 
an amount established by the Office in instructions, for printing and 
mailing of pre-offset notices. This fee shall be credited to the Health 
and Human Services appropriations which bore all or part of the costs 
involved in making the collection.
    (j) Each State involved in a referral of past-due support for offset 
must comply with instructions issued by the Office.

Sec. 303.73  Applications to use the courts of the United States to enforce court orders.

    The IV-D agency may apply to the Secretary for permission to use a 
United States district court to enforce a support order of a court of 
competent jurisdiction against an absent parent who is present in 
another State if the IV7-D agency can furnish evidence in accordance 
with instructions issued by the office.

Sec. 303.80  Recovery of direct payments.

    (a) Definition. Direct payment means an assigned support payment 
from an absent parent which is received directly by an AFDC recipient.
    (b) Direct payments that must be recovered by the IV-D agency. In 
States that place the responsibility for recovery of direct payments 
with the IV-D agency under the State plan option at 
Sec. 302.31(a)(3)(ii) of this chapter, the IV-D agency must recover all 
such payments. The only exception is a direct payment retained by the 
recipient during the period when the sanction for failure to cooperate 
is in effect, as provided at 45 CFR 232.12(d).
    (c) What the IV-D agency must do prior to establishing a repayment 
agreement with an AFDC recipient. Before establishing a repayment 
agreement with an AFDC recipient, the IV-D agency must:
    (1) Document that the recipient has, in fact, received and retained 
direct payments, and the amounts;
    (2) Provide written notice of intent to recover the payments to the 
recipient that includes the following:
    (i) An explanation of the recipient's responsibility to cooperate by 
turning over direct payments as a condition of eligibility for AFDC, and 
the sanction for failure to cooperate as provided at Sec. 232.12(d) of 
this title;
    (ii) A detailed list of the direct payments which have been retained 
by the recipient, as documented by the IV-D agency, including the dates 
and amounts of these payments as well as a description of any 
documentary evidence (such as photocopies of the checks) which the IV-D 
agency possesses;
    (iii) A proposal for a repayment plan between the recipient and the 
IV-D agency;
    (iv) An explanation that repaying retained direct payments to the 
IV-D agency according to a signed repayment plan which meets the 
conditions of paragraph (d) below is a condition of cooperation under 
Sec. 232.12(b)(4) of this title.
    (3) Provide the recipient with an opportunity for an informal 
meeting to clarify the recipient's responsibilities and to resolve any 
differences regarding repayment of the directly received support by the 
recipient.
    (d) Requirements of the repayment agreement. The repayment agreement 
between the IV-D agency and the recipient who has received and retained 
direct payments must be reasonably related to:
    (1) The recipient's income and resources including the AFDC grant; 
and
    (2) The total amount of retained support.
    (e) Referrals to the IV-A agency for a determination of failure to 
cooperate. The IV-D agency must refer a case to the

[[Page 247]]

IV-A agency with evidence of failure to cooperate if:
    (1) The recipient refuses to sign a repayment agreement; or
    (2) The recipient enters into a repayment agreement but subsequently 
fails to make a payment under the terms of the agreement.
    (f) Subsequent notification to the IV-A agency as required. If the 
IV-D agency has referred a case to the IV-A agency with evidence of 
failure to cooperate for either of the reasons in paragraph (e) of this 
section the IV-D agency must notify the IV-A agency when either of the 
following changes in circumstances occurs:
    (1) The recipient who refused to enter into a repayment agreement 
consents to do so and signs the agreement; or
    (2) The recipient who defaulted on an agreement begins making 
regularly scheduled payments according to the agreement. Under this 
paragraph, a regularly scheduled payment is a payment made in the 
current month for the amount specified in the initial repayment 
agreement between the IV-D agency and the recipient. The resumption of 
regularly scheduled payments cannot be interpreted to mean payment of 
amounts which were not paid during the period of default, nor amounts 
which could be categorized as balloon payments or which would be due as 
a result of an acceleration clause. To recover amounts due from any 
period of default, the IV-D agency must extend the duration of the 
repayment agreement.

<R05>
Sec. 303.100  Procedures for wage or income withholding.

    (a) General withholding requirements. (1) The State must ensure that 
in the case of each absent parent against whom a support order is or has 
been issued or modified in the State, and is being enforced under the 
State plan, so much of his or her wages must be withheld, in accordance 
with this section, as is necessary to comply with the order.
    (2) In addition to the amount to be withheld to pay the current 
month's obligation, the amount to be withheld must include an amount to 
be applied toward liquidation of overdue support.
    (3) The total amount to be withheld under paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2) 
and, if applicable, (f)(1)(iii) of this section may not exceed the 
maximum amount permitted under section 303(b) of the Consumer Credit 
Protection Act (15 U.S.C. 1673(b)).
    (4) In the case of a support order being enforced under the State 
plan, the withholding must occur without the need for any amendment to 
the support order involved or any other action by the court or entity 
that issued it other than that required or permitted under this section.
    (5) If there is more than one notice for withholding against a 
single absent parent, the State must allocate amounts available for 
withholding giving priority to current support up to the limits imposed 
under section 303(b) of the Consumer Credit Protection Act (15 U.S.C. 
1673(b)). The State must establish procedures for allocation of support 
among families, but in no case shall the allocation result in a 
withholding for one of the support obligations not being implemented.
    (6) The withholding must be carried out in full compliance with all 
procedural due process requirements of the State.
    (7) The State must have procedures for promptly terminating 
withholding:
    (i) In all cases, when there is no longer a current order for 
support and all arrearages have been satisfied; or,
    (ii) At State option, when the absent parent requests termination 
and withholding has not been terminated previously and subsequently 
initiated, and the absent parent meets the conditions for an alternative 
arrangement set forth under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
    (8) The State must have procedures for promptly refunding to absent 
parents amounts which have been improperly withheld.
    (9) The State may extend its withholding to include withholding from 
forms of income other than wages.
    (10) Support orders issued or modified in IV-D cases must include a 
provision requiring the absent parent to keep the IV-D agency informed 
of the name and address of his or her current employer,

[[Page 248]]

whether the absent parent has access to health insurance coverage at 
reasonable cost and, if so, the health insurance policy information.
    (b) Immediate withholding on IV-D cases. (1) In the case of a 
support order being enforced under this part that is issued or modified 
on or after November 1, 1990, the wages of an absent parent shall be 
subject to withholding, regardless of whether support payments by such 
parent are in arrears, on the effective date of the order, except that 
such wages shall not be subject to withholding under this paragraph in 
any case where:
    (i) Either the absent or custodial parent demonstrates, and the 
court or administrative authority finds, that there is good cause not to 
require immediate withholding; or (ii) A written agreement is reached 
between the absent and custodial parent, and, at State option, the State 
in IV-D cases in which there is an assignment of support rights to the 
State, which provides for an alternative arrangement.
    (2) For the purposes of this paragraph, any finding that there is 
good cause not to require immediate withholding must be based on at 
least:
    (i) A written determination that, and explanation by the court or 
administrative authority of why, implementing immediate wage withholding 
would not be in the best interests of the child; and
    (ii) Proof of timely payment of previously ordered support in cases 
involving the modification of support orders.
    (3) For purposes of this paragraph, ``written agreement'' means a 
written alternative arrangement signed by both the custodial and absent 
parent, and, at State option, by the State in IV-D cases in which there 
is an assignment of support rights to the State, and reviewed and 
entered in the record by the court or administrative authority.
    (c) Initiated withholding in IV-D cases. In the case of wages not 
subject to immediate withholding under paragraph (b) of this section, 
including cases subject to a finding of good cause or to a written 
agreement:
    (1) The wages or the absent parent shall become subject to the 
withholding on the date on which the payments which the absent parent 
has failed to make under a support order are at least equal to the 
support payable for one month or, if earlier, and without regard to 
whether there is an arrearage, the earliest of:
    (i) The date on which the absent parent requests that withholding 
begin;
    (ii) The date on which the custodial parent requests that 
withholding begin, if the State determines, in accordance with such 
procedures and standards as it may establish, that the request should be 
approved; or
    (iii) Such earlier date as State law or procedure may provide.
    (2) The State must send the advance notice required under paragraph 
(d) of this section to the absent parent within 15 calendar days of the 
appropriate date under paragraph (c)(1) of this section if the absent 
parent's address is known on that date, or, if the absent parent's 
address is not known on that date, within 15 calendar days of locating 
the absent parent.
    (3) The only basis for contesting a withholding under this paragraph 
is a mistake of fact, which for purposes of this paragraph means an 
error in the amount of current or overdue support or in the identity of 
the alleged absent parent.
    (d) Advance notice to the absent parent in cases of initiated 
withholding. (1) On the date specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section, the State must send advance notice to the absent parent 
regarding the initiated withholding. The notice must inform the absent 
parent:
    (i) Of the amount of overdue support that is owed, if any, and the 
amount of wages that will be withheld;
    (ii) That the provision for withholding applies to any current or 
subsequent employer or period of employment;
    (iii) Of the procedures available for contesting the withholding and 
that the only basis for contesting the withholding is a mistake of fact;
    (iv) Of the period within which the absent parent must contact the 
State in order to contest the withholding and that failure to contact 
the State within the specified time limit will result in the State 
notifying the employer to begin withholding; and

[[Page 249]]

    (v) Of the actions the State will take if the individual contests 
the withholding, including the procedures established under paragraph 
(e) of this section.
    (2)(i) The requirement for advance notice to the absent parent under 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section and for State procedures when the 
absent parent contests the withholding in response to the advance notice 
under paragraph (e) of this section do not apply in the case of any 
State which had a withholding system in effect on August 16, 1984 if the 
system provided on that date, and continues to provide, any other 
procedures as may be necessary to meet the procedural due process 
requirements of State law.
    (ii) Any State in which paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section applies 
must meet all other requirements of this section and must send notice to 
the employer under paragraph (f) of this section within 15 calendar days 
of the appropriate date specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section if 
the employer's address is known on that date, or, if the employer's 
address is not known on that date, within 15 calendar days of locating 
the employer's address.
    (e) State procedures when the absent parent contests initiated 
withholding in response to the advance notice. The State must establish 
procedures for use when an absent parent contests the withholding. 
Within 45 calendar days of sending advance notice to the absent parent 
under paragraph (d) of this section, the State must:
    (1) Provide the absent parent an opportunity to present his or her 
case to the State;
    (2) Determine if the withholding shall occur based on an evaluation 
of the facts, including the absent parent's statement of his or her 
case;
    (3) Notify the absent parent whether or not the withholding is to 
occur and, if it is to occur, include in the notice the time frames 
within which the withholding will begin and the information given to the 
employer in the notice required under paragraph (f) of this section; and
    (4) If withholding is to occur, send the notice required under 
paragraph (f) of this section.
    (f) Notice to the employer for immediate and initiated withholding. 
(1) To initiate withholding, the State must send the absent parent's 
employer a notice which includes the following:
    (i) The amount to be withheld from the absent parent's wages, and a 
statement that the amount actually withheld for support and other 
purposes, including the fee specified under paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of 
this section, may not be in excess of the maximum amounts permitted 
under section 303(b) of the Consumer Credit Protection Act (15 U.S.C. 
1673(b));
    (ii) That the employer must send the amount to the State (or to such 
other individual or entity as the State may direct) within 10 working 
days of the date the absent parent is paid, and must report to the State 
(or to such other individual or entity as the State may direct) the date 
on which the amount was withheld from the absent parent's wages;
    (iii) That, in addition to the amount withheld for support, the 
employer may deduct a fee established by the State for administrative 
costs incurred for each withholding, if the State permits a fee to be 
deducted;
    (iv) That the withholding is binding upon the employer until further 
notice by the State;
    (v) That the employer is subject to a fine to be determined under 
State law for discharging an absent parent from employment, refusing to 
employ, or taking disciplinary action against any absent parent because 
of the withholding;
    (vi) That, if the employer fails to withhold wages in accordance 
with the provisions of the notice, the employer is liable for the 
accumulated amount the employer should have withheld from the absent 
parent's wages;
    (vii) That the withholding under this section shall have priority 
over any other legal process under State law against the same wages;
    (viii) That the employer may combine withheld amounts from absent 
parents' wages in a single payment to each appropriate agency requesting 
withholding and separately identify the portion of the single payment 
which is attributable to each individual absent parent;

[[Page 250]]

    (ix) That the employer must implement withholding no later than the 
first pay period that occurs after 14 working days following the date 
the notice was mailed; and
    (x) That the employer must notify the State promptly when the absent 
parent terminates employment and provide the absent parent's last known 
address and the name and address of the absent parent's new employer, if 
known.
    (2) In the case of an immediate wage withholding under paragraph (b) 
of this section, the State must issue the notice to the employer 
specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section within 15 calendar days of 
the date the support order is entered if the employer's address is known 
on that date, or, if the address is unknown on that date, within 15 
calendar days of locating the employer's address.
    (3) In the case of initiated withholding, if the absent parent fails 
to contact the State to contest withholding within the period specified 
in the advance notice in accordance with the requirements of paragraph 
(d)(1)(iv) of this section, the State must send the notice to the 
employer required under paragraph (f)(1) of this section within 15 
calendar days of the end of the contact period if the employer's address 
is known on that date, or, if the address is unknown on that date, 
within 15 calendar days of locating the employer's address.
    (4) If the absent parent changes employment within the State when a 
withholding is in effect, the State must notify the absent parent's new 
employer, in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of 
this section, that the withholding is binding on the new employer.
    (g) Administration of withholding. (1) The State must designate a 
public agency to administer withholding in accordance with procedures 
specified by the State for keeping adequate records to document, track, 
and monitor support payments.
    (2)(i) The State may designate public or private entities to 
administer withholding on a State or local basis under the supervision 
of the State withholding agency if the entity or entities are publicly 
accountable and follow the procedures specified by the State; and (ii) 
the State may designate only one entity to administer withholding in 
each jurisdiction.
    (3) Effective October 1, 1997, the State must be capable of 
receiving withheld amounts and accounting information which are 
electronically transmitted by the employer to the State.
    (4) Amounts withheld must be distributed in accordance with section 
457 of the Act and Secs. 302.32, 302.51 and 302.52 of this chapter.
    (5) The State must reduce its IV-D expenditures by any interest 
earned by the State's designee on withheld amounts.
    (h) Interstate withholding. (1) The State law must provide for 
procedures to extend the State's withholding system so that the system 
will include withholding from income or wages derived within the State 
in cases where the applicable support orders were issued in other 
States. A State may require registration of orders from other States for 
purposes of enforcement through withholding only if registration is for 
the sole purpose of obtaining jurisdiction for enforcement of the order; 
does not confer jurisdiction on the court or agency for any other 
purpose (such as modification of the underlying or original support 
order or resolution of custody or visitation disputes); and does not 
delay implementation of withholding beyond the timeframes established in 
paragraph (h)(5) of this section.
    (2) The State law must require employers to comply with a 
withholding notice issued by the State.
    (3) Within 20 calendar days of a determination that withholding is 
required in a particular case, and, if appropriate, receipt of any 
information necessary to carry out withholding, the initiating State 
must notify the IV-D agency of the State in which the absent parent is 
employed to implement interstate withholding. The notice must contain 
all information necessary to carry out the withholding, including the 
amount requested to be withheld, a copy of the support order and a 
statement of arrearages, if appropriate. If necessary, the State where 
the support order is entered must provide the information necessary to 
carry out the

[[Page 251]]

withholding within 30 calendar days of receipt of a request for 
information by the initiating State.
    (4) The State in which the absent parent is employed must implement 
withholding in accordance with paragraph (h)(5) of this section upon 
receipt of the notice required in paragraph (h)(3) of this section.
    (5) The State in which the absent parent is employed must:
    (i) Within 15 calendar days of location of the absent parent and his 
or her employer, send notice to the absent parent, if appropriate, in 
accordance with the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section;
    (ii) Provide the absent parent with an opportunity to contest the 
withholding, if appropriate, in accordance with paragraph (e) of this 
section;
    (iii) Send notice to the employer in accordance with the 
requirements of paragraph (f) of this section; and
    (iv) Notify the State in which the custodial parent is receiving 
services when the absent parent is no longer employed in the State and 
provide the name and address of the absent parent and new employer, if 
known.
    (6) The withholding must be carried out in full compliance with all 
procedural due process requirements of the State in which the absent 
parent is employed.
    (7) Except with respect to when withholding must be implemented 
which is controlled by the State where the support order was entered, 
the law and procedures of the State in which the absent parent is 
employed shall apply.
    (i) Provision for withholding in all child support orders. Child 
support orders issued or modified in the State between October 1, 1985, 
and January 1, 1994, or modified on or after January 1, 1994, must have 
a provision for withholding of wages, in order to ensure that 
withholding as a means of support is available if arrearages occur 
without the necessity of filing an application for IV-D services. This 
requirement does not alter the requirement governing all IV-D cases in 
paragraph (a)(4) of this section that enforcement under the State plan 
must proceed without the need for a withholding provision in the order.

Sec. 303.101  Expedited processes.

    (a) Definition. Expedited processes means administrative or 
expedited judicial processes or both which increase effectiveness and 
meet processing times specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (b) Basic requirement. (1) The State must have in effect and use, in 
interstate and intrastate cases, expedited processes as specified under 
this section to establish paternity and to establish and enforce support 
orders.
    (2) Under expedited processes:
    (i) In IV-D cases needing support order establishment, regardless of 
whether paternity has been established, action to establish support 
orders must be completed from the date of service of process to the time 
of disposition within the following timeframes: (A) 75 percent in 6 
months; and (B) 90 percent in 12 months.
    (ii) In IV-D cases where a support order has been established, 
actions to enforce the support order must be taken within the timeframes 
specified in Secs. 303.6(c)(2) and 303.100;
    (iii) For purposes of the timeframe at Sec. 303.101(b)(2)(i), in 
cases where the IV-D agency uses long-arm jurisdiction and disposition 
occurs within 12 months of service of process on the alleged father or 
noncustodial parent, the case may be counted as a success within the 6 
month tier of the timeframe, regardless of when disposition occurs in 
the 12 month period following service of process.
    (iv) Disposition, as used in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (iii) of this 
section, means the date on which a support order is officially 
established and/or recorded or the action is dismissed.
    (c) Safeguards. Under expedited processes:
    (1) Paternities and orders established by means other than full 
judicial process must have the same force and effect under State law as 
paternities and orders established by full judicial process within the 
State;
    (2) The due process rights of the parties involved must be 
protected;
    (3) The parties must be provided a copy of the voluntary 
acknowledgment of paternity, paternity determination, and/or support 
order;

[[Page 252]]

    (4) There must be written procedures for ensuring the qualification 
of presiding officers;
    (5) Recommendations of presiding officers may be ratified by a 
judge; and
    (6) Action taken may be reviewed under the State's generally 
applicable judicial procedures.
    (d) Functions. The functions performed by presiding officers under 
expedited processes must include at minimum:
    (1) Taking testimony and establishing a record;
    (2) Evaluating evidence and making recommendations or decisions to 
establish paternity and to establish and enforce orders;
    (3) Accepting voluntary acknowledgment of paternity or support 
liability and stipulated agreements setting the amount of support to be 
paid;
    (4) Entering default orders upon a showing that process has been 
served on the defendant in accordance with State law, that the defendant 
failed to respond to service in accordance with State procedures, and 
any additional showing required by State law; and
    (5) Ordering genetic tests in contested paternity cases in 
accordance with Sec. 303.5(d)(1).
    (e) Exemption for political subdivisions. A State may request an 
exemption from any of the requirements of this section for a political 
subdivision on the basis of the effectiveness and timeliness of 
paternity establishment, support order issuance or enforcement within 
the political subdivision in accordance with the provisions of 
Sec. 302.70(d) of this chapter.

Sec. 303.102  Collection of overdue support by State income tax refund offset.

    (a) Overdue support qualifying for offset. Overdue support qualifies 
for State income tax refund offset if:
    (1) There has been an assignment of the support obligation under 
Sec. 232.11 of this title or section 471(a)(17) of the Act or the IV-D 
agency is providing services under Sec. 302.33 of this chapter, and
    (2) The State does not determine, using guidelines it must develop 
which are generally available to the public, that the case is 
inappropriate for application of this procedure.
    (b) Accuracy of amounts referred for offset. The IV-D agency must 
establish procedures to ensure that:
    (1) Amounts referred for offset have been verified and are accurate; 
and
    (2) The appropriate State office or agency is notified of any 
significant reductions in (including an elimination of) an amount 
referred for collection by State income tax refund offset.
    (c) Notice to custodial parent. The IV-D agency must inform 
individuals receiving services under Sec. 302.33 of this chapter, in 
advance:
    (1) That, for cases in which medical support rights have been 
assigned under 42 CFR 433.146, and amounts are collected which represent 
specific dollar amounts designated in the support order for medical 
purposes, amounts offset will be distributed under Sec. 302.51(e) of 
this chapter; and
    (2) If amounts offset will be applied first to satisfy any past-due 
support which has been assigned to the State under Sec. 232.11 of this 
title or section 471(a)(17) of the Act.
    (d) Advance notice to absent parent. The State must send a written 
advance notice to inform the absent parent of the referral for State 
income tax refund offset and of the opportunity to contest the referral.
    (e) Procedures for contesting offset and for reimbursing excess 
amounts offset. (1) The State must establish procedures, which are in 
full compliance with the State's procedural due process requirements, 
for an absent parent to use to contest the referral of overdue support 
for State income tax refund offset.
    (2) If the offset amount is found to be in error or to exceed the 
amount of overdue support, the State IV-D agency must take steps to 
refund the excess amount in accordance with procedures that include a 
mechanism for promptly reimbursing the absent parent.
    (3) The State must establish procedures for ensuring that in the 
event of a joint return, the absent parent's spouse can apply for a 
share of the refund, if appropriate, in accordance with State law.

[[Page 253]]

    (f) Fee for certain cases. The State IV-D agency may charge an 
individual who is receiving services under Sec. 302.33(a)(1) (i) or 
(iii) of this chapter a reasonable fee to cover the cost of collecting 
past-due support using State tax refund offset. The State must inform 
the individual in advance of the amount of any fee charged.
    (g) Distribution of collections. (1) A State must distribute 
collections received as a result of State income tax refund offset: (i) 
For an AFDC case, under Sec. 302.51 (b) (4) and (5) and (e) of this 
chapter;
    (ii) For a foster care maintenance case, under Sec. 302.52(b) (3) 
and (4) of this chapter; and
    (iii) For a non-AFDC case, except as specified in paragraph 
(g)(1)(iv) of this section, by paying offset amounts to the family first 
or using them first to reimburse the State, depending on the State's 
method for distributing arrearage collections in non-AFDC cases.
    (iv) For cases in which medical support rights have been assigned 
under 42 CFR 433.146, and amounts are collected which represent specific 
dollar amounts designated in the support order for medical purposes, 
under Sec. 302.51(e) of this chapter.
    (2) If the amount collected is in excess of the amounts required to 
be distributed under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the IV-D agency 
must repay the excess to the absent parent whose State income tax refund 
was offset within a reasonable period in accordance with State law.
    (3) The State must credit amounts offset on individual payment 
records.
    (h) Information to the IV-D agency. The State agency responsible for 
processing the State tax refund offset must notify the State IV-D agency 
of the absent parent's home address and social security number or 
numbers. The State IV-D agency must provide this information to any 
other State involved in enforcing the support order.

    (b) For cases in which the amount overdue support exceeds $1,000, 
the IV-D agency must have in effect procedures to make information 
available to consumer reporting agencies upon their request regarding 
the amount of overdue support owed by an absent parent. The procedures 
must include use of guidelines that are generally available to the 
public to determine whether application of this procedure is 
inappropriate in a particular case. In cases in which the overdue 
support is less than $1,000, these procedures are at the option of the 
State.

<R05>
Sec. 304.12  Incentive payments.

    (a) Definitions. For the purposes of this section: AFDC collections 
means support collections satisfying an assigned support obligation 
under Sec. 232.11 of this title or section 471(a)(17) of the Act, 
including collections treated in accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of 
this section.
    Non-AFDC collections means support collections, on behalf of 
individuals receiving services under this title, satisfying a support 
obligation which has not been assigned under Sec. 232.11 of this title 
or section 471(a)(17) of the Act, including collections treated in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section .
    Total IV-D administrative costs means total IV-D administrative 
expenditures claimed by a State in a specified fiscal year adjusted in 
accordance with paragraphs (b)(4)(iii), (b)(4)(iv) and (b)(4)(v) of this 
section.
    (b) Incentive payments to States. Effective October 1, 1985, the 
Office shall compute incentive payments for States for a fiscal year in 
recognition of AFDC collections and of non-AFDC collections.
    (1) A portion of a State's incentive payment shall be computed as a 
percentage of the State's AFDC collections, and a portion of the 
incentive payment shall be computed as a percentage of its non-AFDC 
collections. The percentages are determined separately for AFDC and non-
AFDC portions of the incentive. The percentages are based on the ratio 
of the State's AFDC collections to the State's total administrative 
costs and the State's non-AFDC collections to the State's total 
administrative costs in accordance with the following schedule:

                                                                        
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                              Percent of
                                                              collection
  Ratio of collections to total IV-D administrative costs     paid as an
                                                              incentive 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Less than 1.4..............................................          6.0
At least 1.4...............................................          6.5
At least 1.6...............................................          7.0
At least 1.8...............................................          7.5
At least 2.0...............................................          8.0
At least 2.2...............................................          8.5
At least 2.4...............................................          9.0
At least 2.6...............................................          9.5
At least 2.8...............................................         10.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) The ratios of the State's AFDC and non-AFDC collections to total 
IV-D administrative costs will be truncated at one decimal place.
    (3) The portion of the incentive payment paid to a State for a 
fiscal year in recognition of its non-AFDC collections is limited to the 
percentage of

[[Page 256]]

the portion of the incentive payment paid for that fiscal year in 
recognition of its AFDC collections, as follows:
    (i) 100 percent in fiscal years 1986 and 1987;
    (ii) 105 percent in fiscal year 1988;
    (iii) 110 percent in fiscal year 1989; and
    (iv) 115 percent in fiscal year 1990 and thereafter.
    (4) In calculating the amount of incentive payments, the following 
conditions apply:
    (i) Only those AFDC and non-AFDC collections distributed and 
expenditures claimed by the State in the fiscal year shall be used to 
determine the incentive payment payable for that fiscal year;
    (ii) Support collected by one State on behalf of individuals 
receiving IV-D services in another State shall be treated as having been 
collected in full by each State;
    (iii) Fees paid by individuals, recovered costs, and program income 
such as interest earned on collections shall be deducted from total IV-D 
administrative costs;
    (iv) At the option of the State, laboratory costs incurred in 
determining paternity may be excluded from total IV-D administrative 
costs; and
    (v) Effective January 1, 1990, amounts expended by the State in 
carrying out a special project under section 455(e) of the Act shall not 
be included in the State's total IV-D administrative costs.
    (vi) Costs of demonstration projects for evaluating model procedures 
for reviewing child support awards under section 103(e) of Public Law 
100-485 shall not be included in the State's total IV-D administrative 
costs.
    (c) Payment of incentives. (1) The Office will estimate the total 
incentive payment that each State will receive for the upcoming fiscal 
year.
    (2) Each State will include one-quarter of the estimated total 
payment in its quarterly collection report which will reduce the amount 
that would otherwise be paid to the Federal government to reimburse its 
share of assistance payments under Secs. 302.51 and 302.52 of this 
chapter.
    (3) Following the end of a fiscal year, the Office will calculate 
the actual incentive payment the State should have received based on the 
reports submitted for that fiscal year. If adjustments to the estimate 
made under paragraph (c)(1) of this section are necessary, the State's 
IV-A grant award will be reduced or increased because of over- or under-
estimates for prior quarters and for other adjustments.
    (4) For FY 1985, the Office will calculate a State's incentive 
payment based on AFDC collections retained by the State and paid to the 
family under Sec. 302.51(b)(1) of this chapter.
    (5) For FY 1986 and 1987, a State will receive the higher of the

    (a) From the amounts of support collected by the State and retained 
as reimbursement for AFDC payments, the State shall reimburse the 
Federal government to the extent of its participation in the financing 
of the AFDC payment. In computing the Federal share of support 
collections, the State has two options:
    (1) The State may use the AFDC FFP rate applicable to the period in 
which the assistance payment was made as follows:
    (i) If the State uses the Federal medical assistance percentage 
under section 1118 of the Act, this percentage shall be used in 
computing the Federal share of collections.
    (ii) If the State uses the computations in section 403(a) of the 
Act, the Federal share of collections shall be computed using the rate 
of Federal participation in the financing of:
    (A) The individual assistance payment; or
    (B) All of the assistance payments in the same month; or
    (2) The State may use the current rate of AFDC FFP as follows:

[[Page 261]]

    (i) If the State uses the Federal medical assistance percentage 
under section 1118 of the Act, the percentage applicable at the time of 
distribution shall be used in computing the Federal share of 
collections.
    (ii) If the State uses the computations in section 403(a) of the 
Act, the average rate of Federal participation in the financing of 
assistance payments during the immediately preceding quarter shall be 
used in computing the Federal share of collections.
    (b) If an incentive payment is made to a jurisdiction under 
Sec. 304.12 of this chapter for the enforcement and collection of

If the State chooses to repay amounts representing higher percentages 
during the early quarters, any corresponding reduction in required 
minimum percentages would be applied first to the last scheduled 
payment, then to the next to the last payment, and so forth as 
necessary.
    (2) The latest OCSE-OA-25 submitted by the State shall be used to 
estimatethe State's share of annual expenditures for the IV-D program. 
That estimated share shall be the sum of the State's share of the 
estimates (as shown on the latest OSCE-OA-25) for four quarters, 
beginning with the quarter in which the first installment is to be paid.
    (3) In case of termination of the program, the actual State share--
rather than the estimate--shall be used for determining whether the 
amount of the repayment exceeds 2\1/2\ percent of the annual State share 
for the IV-D program. The annual State share in these cases will be 
determined using payments computable for Federal funding as reported for 
the program by the State on its Quarterly Statement of Expenditures 
(SRA-OA-41) reports submitted for the last four quarters preceding the 
date on which the program was terminated.
    (4) Repayment shall be accomplished through adjustment in the 
quarterly grants over the period covered by the repayment schedule.
    (5) The amount of the repayment for purpose of paragraphs (a) and 
(b) of this section may not include any amount previously approved for 
installment repayment.
    (6) The repayment schedule may be extended beyond 12 quarterly 
installments if the total repayment amount exceeds 100% of the estimated 
State share of annual expenditures.

In these circumstances, the criteria in paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) or 
(3) of this section, as appropriate, shall be followed for repayment of 
the amount equal to 100% of the annual State share. The remaining amount 
of the repayment shall be in quarterly amounts not less than those for 
the 9th through 12th quarters.
    (7) The amount of a retroactive claim to be paid a State will be 
offset against any amounts to be, or already being, repaid by the State 
in installments, under the same title of the Social Security Act. Under 
this provision the State may choose to:
    (i) Suspend payments until the retroactive claim due the State has, 
in fact, been offset; or
    (ii) Continue payments until the reduced amount of its debt 
(remaining after the offset), has been paid in full. This second option 
would result in a shorter payment period.

A retroactive claim for the purpose of this regulation is a claim 
applicable to any period ending 12 months or more prior to the beginning 
of the quarter in which the payment is to be made by the Service.

    This part implements the requirements in sections 452(a)(4) and 
403(h) of the Act for an audit, at least once every three years, of the 
effectiveness of State Child Support Enforcement programs under title 
IV-D and for a possible reduction in Federal reimbursement for a State's 
title IV-A program pursuant to sections 403(h) and 404(d) of the Act. 
Sections 305.10 through 305.13 describe the audit. Section 305.20 sets 
forth audit criteria and subcriteria the Office will use to determine 
program effectiveness and defines an effective program for purposes of 
an audit. Section 305.98 sets forth the performance indicators the 
Office will use to determine State IV-D program effectiveness. Section 
305.99 provides for the issuance of a notice and corrective action 
period if a State is found by the Secretary not to have an effective IV-
D program. Section 305.100 provides for the imposition of a penalty if a 
State is found by the Secretary not to have had an effective program and 
to have failed to take corrective action and achieve substantial 
compliance within the period prescribed by the Secretary.

Sec. 305.10  Timing and scope of audit.

    (a) The Office will conduct an audit in accordance with sections 
452(a)(4) and 403(h) of the Act, at least once every three years, to 
evaluate the effectiveness of each State's program in carrying out the 
purposes of title IV-D of the Act and to determine that the program 
meets the title IV-D requirements. The audit of each State's program 
will be a comprehensive review using the criteria prescribed in 
Secs. 305.20 and 305.98 of this part.
    (b) The Office will conduct an annual comprehensive audit in the 
case of a State that is being penalized. For a State operating under a 
corrective action plan, the review at the end of the corrective action 
period will cover only the criteria specified in the notice of non-
compliance as prescribed in Sec. 305.99 of this part.
    (c) During the course of the audit, the Office will:
    (1) Make a critical investigation of the State's IV-D program 
through inspection, inquiries, observation, and confirmation; and
    (2) Use the audit standards promulgated by the Comptroller General 
of the United States in ``Government Auditing Standards.''

Sec. 305.12  State comments.

    (a) Prior to the start of the actual audit, the Office will hold an 
audit entrance conference with the IV-D agency. At that conference, the 
Office will explain how the audit will be performed and make any 
necessary arrangements.
    (b) Prior to concluding the audit fieldwork, the Office will afford 
the State IV-D agency an opportunity for an audit exit conference at 
which time preliminary audit findings will be discussed and the IV-D 
agency may present any additional matter it believes should be 
considered in the audit findings.
    (c) At the conclusion of the audit fieldwork, the Office will 
prepare and send to the IV-D agency a copy of its interim report on the 
results of the audit. Within 45 days from the date the report was sent 
by certified mail, the IV-D agency may submit written comments on any 
part of the report which the IV-D agency believes to be in error. The 
Office will incorporate such comments, if any, into the final audit 
report.

Sec. 305.98  Performance indicators and audit criteria.

    (a) Beginning with the fiscal year 1986 audit period, the Office 
will use the following performance indicators in determining whether 
each State has an effective IV-D program.
    (1) AFDC IV-D collections divided by total IV-D expenditures (less 
laboratory cost incurred in determining paternity at State option);
    (2) Non-AFDC IV-D collections divided by total IV-D expenditures 
(less laboratory costs incurred in determining paternity at State 
option); and
    (3) AFDC IV-D collections divided by IV-A assistance payments (Less 
payments to unemployed parents).
    (b) Beginning with the fiscal year 1988 audit period, the Office 
will use the performance indicators prescribed in paragraph (a) of this 
section and the following performance indicators in determining whether 
each State has an effective IV-D program.
    (1) AFDC IV-D collections on support due (for a fiscal year) divided 
by total AFDC support due (for the same fiscal year);
    (2) Non-AFDC IV-D collections on support due (for a fiscal year) 
divided by total non-AFDC support due (for the same fiscal year);
    (3) AFDC IV-D collections on support due (for prior periods) divided 
by total AFDC support due (for the same periods); and
    (4) Non-AFDC IV-D collection on support due (for prior periods) 
divided by total non-AFDC support due (for the same periods).
    (c) The Office shall use the following procedures and audit criteria 
to measure State performance.
    (1) The ratio for each of the performance indicators in paragraph 
(a) of this section will be evaluated on the basis of the scores in the 
tables in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section. The tables 
show the scores the States will receive for different levels of 
performance.
    (i) Dollar of AFDC IV-D collections per dollar of total IV-D 
expenditures (less laboratory costs incurred in determining paternity at 
State option).

    (2) To be found to meet the audit criteria, a State's total score 
must equal or exceed 70.

    Examples. A State achieves levels of performance of $1.22, $1.35 and 
6.5 percent on the performance indicators in paragraph (a) of this 
section. The State would receive individual scores of 24, 48 and 20 on 
these performance indicators. The State would be found to meet the audit 
criteria because the total score is 92.

[[Page 267]]

    A State achieves levels of performance of $.65, $.65 and 2.5 percent 
on the performance indicators in paragraph (a) of this section. The 
State would receive individual scores of 14, 28 and 5 on these 
performance indicators. The State would be found not to meet the audit 
criteria because the total score is 47.
    A State achieves levels of performance of $.92, $.96 and 4.2 percent 
on the performance indicators in paragraph (a) of this section. The 
State would receive individual scores of 20, 40 and 10 on these 
performance indicators. The State would be found to meet the audit 
criteria because the total score is 70.

    (d) The scoring system provided in paragraph (c) of this section 
will be described and updated whenever OCSE determines that it is 
necessary and appropriate by the Office in regulations.

Sec. 305.99  Notice and corrective action period.

    (a) If a State is found by the Secretary on the basis of the results 
of the audit described in this part not to comply substantially with the 
requirements of title IV-D of the Act, as implemented by chapter III of 
this title, the Office will notify the State in writing of such finding.
    (b) The notice will:
    (1) Cite the State for noncompliance, list the unmet audit criteria, 
apply a penalty and give reasons for the Secretary's finding;
    (2) Identify any audit criteria listed in Sec. 305.20(a)(3) of this 
part that the State met only marginally [that is, in 75 to 80 percent of 
cases reviewed for criteria in Sec. 305.20(a)(3)];
    (3) Specify that the penalty may be suspended if the State meets the 
conditions specified in paragraph (c) of this section; and
    (4) Specify the conditions that result in terminating the suspension 
of the penalty as specified in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (c) The penalty will be suspended for a period not to exceed one 
year from the date of the notice if the following conditions are met:
    (1) Within 60 days of the date of the notice, the State submits a 
corrective action plan to the appropriate Regional Office which contains 
a corrective action period not to exceed one year from the date of the 
notice and which contains steps necessary to achieve substantial 
compliance with the requirements of title IV-D of the Act;
    (2) The corrective action plan and any amendment are:
    (i) Approved by the Secretary within 30 days of receipt of the 
corrective action plan; or
    (ii) Approved automatically because the Secretary took no action 
within the period specified in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section; and
    (3) The Secretary finds that the corrective action plan (or any 
amendment to it approved by the Secretary) is being fully implemented by 
the State and that the State is progressing to achieve substantial 
compliance with the unmet criteria cited in the notice.
    (d) The suspension of the penalty will continue until such time as 
the Secretary determines that:
    (1) The State has achieved substantial compliance with the unmet 
criteria cited in the notice and maintained substantial compliance with 
any marginally-met criteria cited in the notice;
    (2) During the corrective action period, the State is not 
implementing its corrective action plan; or
    (3) The State has implemented its corrective action plan but has 
failed to achieve substantial compliance with the unmet criteria cited 
in the notice and maintain substantial compliance with any marginally-
met criteria cited in the notice. For State plan-related criteria, this 
determination will be made as of the first full three-month period after 
the corrective action period. For performance indicator-related 
criteria, this determination will be made as of the first full four 
quarters following the end of the corrective action period.
    (e) A corrective action plan disapproved under paragraph (c) of this 
section is not subject to appeal.
    (f) Only one corrective action period is provided to a State in 
relation to a

Sec. 307.1  Definitions.

    (a) Alternative approach to APD requirements means that the State 
has developed an APD that does not meet all conditions for APD approval 
in Sec. 307.15(b) resulting in the need for a waiver under Sec. 307.5.
    (b) Alternative system means the separate manual and/or automated 
processes that perform one or more of the required functions separately 
from the base system and that interfaces with the base system to ensure 
that the State can meet all requirements for purposes of the audit 
prescribed in section 403(h) of the Act. These separate processes may 
involve geographic areas, such as counties; administrative 
jurisdictions, such as courts; or separate means by which the State 
meets particular program requirements, e.g., collection of support for 
non-AFDC cases.
    (c) Alternative system configuration means an alternative to a 
comprehensive computerized support enforcement system. It includes a 
base system with electronic linkages to an alternative system(s), which 
is not part of the State's computerized support enforcement project 
(i.e., not the State's sole system effort), but which is necessary to 
meet the functional requirements of the statewide, comprehensive 
computerized support enforcement system under Sec. 307.10.
    (d) Base system means the hardware, operational software, 
applications software and electronic linkages in an alternative system 
configuration which allow the State to monitor, account for and control 
all support enforcement services and activities under the State plan.
    (e) Certification means approval of an operational computerized 
support enforcement system based on a determination that the system has 
an efficient and effective design and is comprehensive, except where a 
waiver applies.
    (f) Comprehensive means that a computerized support enforcement 
system meets the requirements prescribed in Sec. 307.10 of this part, as 
further defined in the OCSE guideline entitled ``Automated Systems for 
Child Support Enforcement: A Guide for States.''
    (g) Computerized support enforcement system means a comprehensive, 
statewide system or an alternative system configuration which 
encompasses all political subdivisions within the State and which 
effectively and efficiently;
    (1) Introduces, processes, accounts for and monitors data used by 
the Child Support Enforcement program in carrying out activities under 
the State plan; and
    (2) Produces utilization and management information about support 
enforcement services as required by the State IV-D agency and Federal 
government for program administration and audit purposes.
    (h) Planning means: (1) The preliminary project activity to 
determine the requirements necessitating the project, the activities to 
be undertaken, and

[[Page 270]]

the resources required to complete the project;
    (2) The preparation of an APD;
    (3) The preparation of a detailed project plan describing when and 
how the computer system will be designed or transferred and adapted; and
    (4) The preparation of a detailed implementation plan describing 
specific training, testing, and conversion plans to install the computer 
system.
    (i) The following terms are defined at 45 CFR part 95, subpart F, in 
Sec. 95.605:

``Advance Planning Document'';

<R05>
Sec. 307.5  Mandatory computerized support enforcement systems.

    (a) Basic requirement. By October 1, 1997, each State must have in 
effect an operational computerized support enforcement system, which is 
certified.
    (b) APD requirements. By October 1, 1991, each State must submit an 
APD or APD update that meets the conditions set forth in Sec. 307.15 for 
review and approval by the Secretary.
    (c) Waiver option. A State may apply for a waiver of any functional 
requirement in Sec. 307.10 by presenting a plan for an alternative 
system configuration, or a waiver of any conditions for APD approval in 
Sec. 307.15(b) by presenting an alternative approach. Waiver requests 
must be submitted and approved as part of the State's APD or APD update.
    (d) Conditions for waiver. The Secretary may grant a State a waiver 
if:
    (1) The State demonstrates that it has an alternative approach to 
the APD requirements or an alternative system configuration that enables 
the State, in accordance with part 305 of this chapter, to be in 
substantial compliance with the other requirements of this chapter; and 
either:
    (2) The waiver request meets the criteria set forth in section 
1115(c) (1), (2) and (3) of the Act; or
    (3) The State provides written assurance that steps will be taken to 
otherwise improve the State's Child Support Enforcement program.
    (e) APD submittal requirements for alternative system configuration. 
APDs submitted by States which include requests for waiver for an 
alternative system configuration must, in addition to meeting conditions 
of Sec. 307.15(b):
    (1) Describe the State's base system;
    (2) Include a detailed description of the separate automated or 
manual processes the State plans to use and how they will interface with 
the base system;
    (3) Provide documentation that the alternative system configuration 
will enable the State to be in substantial compliance with title IV-D of 
the Act in accordance with section 403(h) of the Act and implementing 
regulations. In addition, if the State is subject to a Notice under 
Sec. 305.99 of this part that it did not substantially comply with one 
or more of the requirements of title IV-D of the Act, at the time a 
waiver request is submitted, the State must:
    (i) Demonstrate that the deficiency is not related to or caused by 
the performance of the system; or
    (ii) Specify the corrective action taken to modify the system if the 
system contributed to the deficiency.
    (f) APD submittal requirements for alternative approach. APDs 
submitted by States which include requests for waiver of conditions for 
APD approval in Sec. 307.15(b) must demonstrate why meeting the 
conditions is unnecessary or inappropriate.
    (g) Review of waiver requests. (1) The Office will review waiver 
requests to assure that all necessary information is provided, that all 
processes provide for effective and efficient program operation, and 
that the conditions for waiver in paragraph (d) of this section are met.
    (2) When a waiver is approved, it becomes part of the State's 
approved APD. A waiver is subject to the APD suspension provisions in 
Sec. 307.40.

[[Page 271]]

    (3) When a waiver is disapproved, the APD will be disapproved. The 
APD disapproval is a final administrative decision and is not subject to 
administrative appeal.
    (h) FFP limitations. (1) The provisions of Secs. 307.30 and 307.35 
apply to requests for FFP for costs of computerized support enforcement 
systems.
    (2) FFP for alternative system configurations is further limited as 
follows:
    (i) FFP is available at the enhanced matching rate for development 
of the base system and for hardware, operational system software, and 
electronic linkages with the separate components of an alternative 
system configuration.
    (ii) FFP is available at the applicable matching rate for minor 
alterations to the separate automated or manual processes that are part 
of an alternative system configuration and for operating costs including 
hardware, operational software and applications software of a 
computerized support enforcement system.
    (iii) FFP is not available for developing new systems or making 
major changes and enhancements to separate automated or manual processes 
so that alternative system configurations meet conditions for waiver.

administrative costs (``CMA grants''), for the following purposes: Cash 
assistance provided by a State or local public agency under the program 
of aid to families with dependent children (AFDC) under part A of title 
IV of the Social Security Act, under the adult assistance programs 
(AABD, AB, APTD, or OAA) in the territories, or under section 412(e) of 
the Immigration and Nationality Act; foster care maintenance provided 
under part E of title IV of the Social Security Act; State supplementary 
payments under section 1616(a) of the Social Security Act or section 212 
of the Pub. L. 93-66; medical assistance under title XIX of the Social

circumstances within the State; and
    (2) Grants for social services, as set forth in this part. ORR will 
compute the amount of the quarterly awards based on documents submitted 
by the State agency in accordance with this section and such other 
pertinent facts as the Director may find necessary.
    (b) Form and manner of State application for grant award--(1) CMA 
grants. For quarterly grants for cash assistance, medical assistance, 
and related administrative costs, including assistance and services to 
unaccompanied minors (``CMA grants''), a State must submit to the 
Director, or designee, yearly estimates for reimbursable costs for the 
fiscal year, identified by type of expense, and a justification

refugee social services, a State must submit to the Director, or 
designee, an annual plan developed on the basis of local consultative 
process on a form and at a time prescribed by the Director.
    (3) Quarterly adjustments. If a State revises its estimates required 
in paragraph (b)(1), it must submit to the Director, or designee, the 
revisions, accompanied by a justification statement, no later than 30 
days prior to the beginning of the quarter in which the revision or 
adjustment applies.
    (c) Financial status report. A State must submit to the Director, or 
designee, a financial status report described in Sec. 74.73(a) of this 
title, no later than 30 days after the end of each quarter. Final 
financial reports must

[[Page 284]]

be submitted in accordance with the requirements described in 
Sec. 400.210.
    (d) Review. ORR will determine whether the State's description of 
services, estimates, other relevant information, and any adjustments to 
be made for prior periods meet the requirements under this part, and 
will compute the quarterly award.
    (e) Grant award. (1) ORR will transmit to the State the grant award 
form showing, by type of assistance, the amount of the award.
    (2) The State may draw funds, under the Department's Payment 
Management System (PMS), as needed, to meet the Federal share of

[60 FR 33602, June 28, 1995]

     Criteria for Appropriate Employability Services and Employment


<R05>
Sec. 400.81  Criteria for appropriate employability services and employment.

    The State agency or its designee must determine if employability 
services and employment are appropriate in accordance with the following 
criteria:
    (a) The services or employment must meet the following criteria, or, 
if approved by the Director, the comparable criteria applied by the 
State in an alternative program for AFDC recipients:
    (1) All assignments must be within the scope of the individual's 
employability plan. The plan may be modified to reflect changed services 
or employment conditions.
    (2) The services or employment must be related to the capability of 
the individual to perform the task on a regular basis. Any claim of 
adverse effect on physical or mental health must be based on adequate 
medical testimony from a physician or licensed or certified psychologist 
indicating that participation would impair the individual's physical or 
mental health.
    (3) The total daily commuting time to and from home to the service 
or employment site must not normally exceed 2 hours, not including the 
transporting of a child to and from a child care facility, unless a 
longer commuting distance or time is generally accepted in the 
community, in which case the round trip commuting time must not exceed 
the generally accepted community standards.
    (4) When child care is required, the care must meet the standards 
normally required by the State in its work and training programs for 
AFDC recipients.
    (5) The service or work site to which the individual is assigned 
must not be in violation of applicable Federal, State, or local health 
and safety standards.
    (6) Assignments must not be made which are discriminatory in terms 
of age, sex, race, creed, color, or national origin.
    (7) Appropriate work may be temporary, permanent, full-time, part-
time, or seasonal work if such work meets the other standards of this 
section.
    (8) The wage shall meet or exceed the Federal or State minimum wage 
law, whichever is applicable, or if such laws are not applicable, the 
wage shall not be substantially less favorable than the wage normally 
paid for similar work in that labor market.
    (9) The daily hours of work and the weekly hours of work shall not 
exceed those customary to the occupation. And
    (10) No individual may be required to accept employment if:
    (i) The position offered is vacant due to a strike, lockout, or 
other bona fide labor dispute; or
    (ii) The individual would be required to work for an employer 
contrary to the conditions of his existing membership in the union 
governing that occupation. However, employment not governed by the rules 
of a union in which he or she has membership may be deemed appropriate.
    (11) In addition to meeting the other criteria of this paragraph, 
the quality of training must meet local employers' requirements so that 
the individual will be in a competitive position within the local labor 
market. The training must also be likely to lead to employment which 
will meet the appropriate work criteria.
    (b) If an individual is a professional in need of professional 
refresher training and other recertification services in order to 
qualify to practice his or her profession in the United States, the 
training may consist of full-time attendance in a college or 
professional training program, provided that such training: Is approved 
as part of the individual's employability plan by the State agency, or 
its designee; does not exceed one year's duration (including any time 
enrolled in such program in the United States prior to the refugee's 
application for assistance); is specifically intended to assist the 
professional in becoming relicensed in his or

[[Page 293]]

her profession; and, if completed, can realistically be expected to 
result in such relicensing.
    (c) A job offered, if determined appropriate under the requirements 
of this subpart, is required to be accepted by the refugee without 
regard to whether such job would interrupt a program of services planned 
or in progress unless:
    (1) The refugee is currently participating in a program in progress 
of on-the-job training (as described in Sec. 400.154(c)) or vocational 
training (as described in Sec. 400.154(e)) which meets the requirements 
of this part and which is being carried out as part of an approved 
employability plan; or
    (2) The refugee is enrolled full-time in a professional 
recertification program which meets the requirements of paragraph (b) of 
this section.

    Failure or Refusal to Accept Employability Services or Employment


<R05>
Sec. 400.82  Failure or refusal to accept employability services or employment.

    (a) Voluntary registrant. When a voluntary registrant--i.e., a 
recipient of refugee cash assistance who is exempt from registration 
under Sec. 400.76 of this part--has failed or refused to participate in 
appropriate employability services, or to accept an appropriate offer of 
employment, the State agency, or its designee, may deregister the 
individual for up to 90 days from the date of determination that such 
failure or refusal has occurred, but the individual's cash assistance 
may not be affected.
    (b) Mandatory registrant--(1) Termination of assistance. When, 
without good cause, a mandatory registrant--i.e., an employable 
recipient of refugee cash assistance who is not exempt from registration 
under Sec. 400.76 of this part--has failed or refused to meet the 
requirements of Sec. 400.75(a) or has voluntarily quit a job, the State 
must terminate assistance, in accordance with paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) 
of this section.
    (2) Notice of intended termination. (i) In cases of proposed action 
to terminate, discontinue, suspend, or reduce assistance, the State 
agency must give timely and adequate notice, following the same 
procedures as those used in its AFDC program under Sec. 206.10(a)(7) of 
this title.
    (ii) The written notice must include--
    (A) An explanation of the reason for the action and the consequences 
of such failure or refusal; and
    (B) Notice of the registrant's right to a hearing under Sec. 400.83 
of this part.
    (3) Sanctions. (i) If the sanctioned individual is the only member 
of the filing unit, the assitance shall be terminated. If the filing 
unit includes other members, the State shall not take into account the 
sanctioned individual's needs in determining the filing unit's need for 
assistance.
    (ii) The sanction applied in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section 
shall remain in effect for 3 payment months for the first such failure 
and 6 payment months for any subsequent such failure.

<R05>
Sec. 400.83  Conciliation and fair hearings.

    (a) A conciliation period prior to the imposition of sanctions must 
be provided for in accordance with the following time-limitations: The 
conciliation effort shall begin as soon as possible, but no later than 
10 days following the date of failure or refusal to participate, and may 
continue for a period not to exceed 30 days. Either the State or the 
recipient may terminate this period sooner when either believes that the 
dispute cannot be resolved by conciliation.
    (b) The State must provide an applicant for or recipient of refugee 
cash assistance an opportunity for a hearing, using the same procedures 
and standards set forth in Sec. 205.10(a) of this title, to contest a 
determination concerning employability, or failure or refusal to carry 
out job search or to accept an appropriate offer of employability 
services or employment, resulting in denial or termination of 
assistance.

interpretations thereof by the Director) prior to the effective date of 
this definition may continue to be so classified until such status is

after the minor arrives at the location of resettlement.
    (b) In establishing legal responsibility, including legal custody 
and/or guardianship under State law, as appropriate, the minor's natural 
parents should not be contacted in their native country since contact 
could be dangerous to the parents.
    (c) Unaccompanied minors are not generally eligible for adoption 
since family reunification is the objective of the program. In certain 
rare cases, adoption may be permitted pursuant to adoption laws in the 
State of resettlement, provided a court finds that: (1) Adoption would 
be in the best interest of the child; and (2) there is termination of 
parental rights (for example, in situations where the parents are dead

    (a) A State may provide care and services to an unaccompanied minor 
directly or through arrangements with a public or private child welfare 
agency approved or licensed under State law.

or private nonprofit child welfare agency, it must retain oversight 
responsibility for the appropriateness of the unaccompanied minor's 
care.

Sec. 400.118  Case planning.

    (a) A State, or its designee under Sec. 400.117, must develop and

services provided to, each unaccompanied minor, to ensure that the child 
is placed in a foster home or other setting approved by the legally 
responsible agency and in accordance with the child's need for care

[[Page 298]]

and for social, health, and educational services.
    (b) Case planning for unaccompanied minors must, at a minimum, 
address the following elements:
    (1) Family reunification;

emphasis upon English language instruction and occupational as well as 
cultural training as necessary to facilitate the child's social 
integration and to prepare the child for independent living and economic 
self-sufficiency.
    (6) Preservation of the child's ethnic and religious heritage.
    (c) A State, or its designee under section 400.117 of this part, 
must review the continuing appropriateness of each unaccompanied minor's 
living arrangement and services no less frequently than every 6 months.

(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 
0960-0418)


<R05>
Sec. 400.119  Interstate movement.

    After the initial placement of an unaccompanied minor, the same 
procedures that govern the movement of nonrefugee foster cases to other 
States apply to the movement of unaccompanied minors to other States.


<R05>
Sec. 400.120  Reporting requirements.

    A State must submit to ORR, on forms prescribed by the Director, the

placement in the State;
    (b) A progress report every 12 months beginning with 12 months from

[60 FR 33604, June 28, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 400.211  Methodology to be used to determine time-eligibility of refugees.

    (a) The time-eligibility period for refugee cash assistance and 
refugee medical assistance will be determined by the Director each year, 
based on appropriated funds available for the fiscal year. The Director 
will make a determination of the eligibility period each year as soon as 
possible after funds are appropriated for the refugee program, and also 
at subsequent points during the fiscal year, only if necessary, based on 
updated information on refugee flows and State reports on receipt of 
assistance and expenditures. The method to be used to determine the RCA/
RMA eligibility period will include the following steps and will be 
applied to various RCA/RMA time-eligibility periods in order to 
determine the time-eligibility period which will provide the most number 
of months without incurring a shortfall in funds for the fiscal year.
    (1) The time-eligibility population for the projected fiscal year 
will be estimated on the basis of the refugee admissions ceiling 
established by the President for that fiscal year and the anticipated 
arrival of other persons eligible for refugee assistance, to the extent 
that data on these persons are available. The anticipated pattern of 
refugee flow for the projected fiscal year will be estimated based on 
the best available historical and current refugee flow information that 
will most accurately forecast the refugee flow for the projected fiscal 
year. These arrival figures will then be used to determine the time-
eligible population for a given duration of RCA/RMA benefits.
    (2) The average annual member of RCA and RMA recipients will be 
determined by multiplying the estimated time-eligible population 
established in paragraph (a)(1) of this section by the estimated RCA and 
RMA participation rates. The RMA participation rate will take into 
account both RCA recipients, who are also eligible for RMA, and RMA-only 
recipients. Recipient data from quarterly performance reports submitted 
by States for the most recent 4 quarters for which reports are available 
will be used to determine the

[[Page 304]]

appropriate participation rates for various RCA/RMA time-eligibility 
periods.
    (3) The average annual per recipient cost for RCA and RMA will be 
estimated separately, based on estimated per recipient costs for the 
most recent fiscal year, using available data, and inflated for the 
projected fiscal year using projected increases in per capita AFDC cash 
assistance costs for RCA and per capita AFDC Medicaid costs for RMA.
    (4) The expected average number of RCA recipients will be multiplied 
by the expected RCA per recipient cost to derive estimated RCA costs. 
The expected average annual number of RMA recipients will be multiplied 
by the expected RMA per recipient cost to derive estimated RMA costs.
    (5) State administrative costs for the projected fiscal year for all 
States in the aggregate will be estimated based on total actual 
allowable expenditures for State administration for the most recent 
fiscal year. The variable portion of administrative costs will be 
adjusted for changes in program participation and inflated by the 
Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all items as estimated by the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB). The fixed portion of administrative costs 
will be adjusted by the CPI inflator only.
    (6) The total estimated costs for the projected fiscal year will 
equal the combined estimated costs for RCA, RMA, and State 
administration as calculated in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this 
section.
    (b) If, as the Director determines, the period of eligibility needs 
to be changed from the eligibility period in effect at the time, the 
Director will publish a final notice in the Federal Register, announcing 
the new period of eligibility for refugee cash assistance and refugee 
medical assistance and the effective date for impleting the new 
eligibility period. States will be given as much notice as available 
funds will allow without resulting in a further reduction in the 
eligibility period. At a minimum, States will be given 30 days' notice.

Sec. 400.220  Counting time-eligibility of refugees.

    A State may calculate the time-eligibility of a refugee under this 
part in either of the following ways:
    (a) On the basis of calendar months, in which case the month of 
arrival in the United States must count as the first month; or
    (b) On the basis of the actual date of arrival, in which case each 
month will be counted from that specific date.

<R05>
Sec. 400.300  Waivers.

    If a State wishes to apply for a waiver of a requirement of this 
part, the Director may waive such requirement with respect to such 
State, unless required by statute, if the Director determines that such 
waiver will advance the purposes of this part and is appropriate and 
consistent with Federal refugee policy objectives. To the fullest extent 
practicable, the Director will approve or disapprove an application for 
a waiver within 130 days of receipt of such application. The Director 
shall provide timely written notice of the reasons for denial to States 
whose applications are disapproved.

Sec. 400.301  Withdrawal from the refugee program.

    (a) In the event that a State decides to cease participation in the 
refugee program, the State must provide 120 days advance notice to the 
Director before withdrawing from the program.
    (b) To participate in the refugee program, a State is expected to 
operate all components of the refugee program, including refugee cash 
and medical assistance, social services, preventive health, and an 
unaccompanied minors

program if appropriate. A State is also expected to play a coordinating 
role in the provision of assistance and services in accordance with 
Sec. 400.5(b). In the event that a State wishes to retain responsibility 
for only part of the refugee program, it must obtain prior approval from 
the Director of ORR. Such approval will be granted only under 
extraordinary circumstances and if it is in the best interest of the 
Government.
    (c) When a State withdraws from all or part of the refugee program, 
the Director may authorize a replacement designee or designees to 
administer the provision of assistance and services, as appropriate, to 
refugees in that State. A replacement designee must adhere to the same 
regulations under this part that apply to a State-administered program, 
with the exception of the following provisions: 45 CFR 400.5(d), 400.7, 
400.55(b)(2), 400.56(a)(1), 400.56(a)(2), 400.56(b)(2)(i), 400.94(a), 
400.94(b), 400.94(c), and subpart L. Certain provisions are excepted 
because they apply only to States and become moot when a State withdraws 
from participation in the refugee program and is replaced by another 
entity. States would continue to be responsible for administering the 
other excepted provisions because these provisions refer to the 
administration of other State-run public assistance programs.

<R05>
Sec. 400.310  Basis and scope.

    This subpart sets forth requirements concerning formula allocation 
grants to States under section 412(c)(2) of the Act for targeted 
assistance.


<R05>
Sec. 400.311  Definitions.

    For purposes of this subpart--
    ``Targeted assistance grants'' means formula allocation funding to 
States for assistance to counties and similar areas in the States where, 
because of factors such as unusually large refugee populations 
(including secondary migration), high refugee concentrations, and high 
use of public assistance by refugees, there exists and can be 
demonstrated a specific need for supplementation of available resources 
for services to refugees.

to apply for targeted assistance services and determine the eligibility 
of each applicant.

                     Funding and Service Priorities


<R05>
Sec. 400.313  Use of funds.

    A State must use its targeted assistance funds primarily for 
employability services designed to enable refugees to obtain jobs with 
less than one year's participation in the targeted assistance program in 
order to achieve economic self-sufficiency as soon as possible. Targeted 
assistance services may continue to be provided after a refugee has 
entered a job to help the refugee retain employment or move to a better 
job. Targeted assistance funds may not be used for long-term training 
programs such as vocational training that last for more than a year or 
educational programs that are not intended to lead to employment within 
a year.


<R05>
Sec. 400.314  Priority in provision of services.

    A State must plan its targeted assistance program and allocate its 
targeted assistance funds in such a manner that services are provided to 
refugees in the following order of priority, except in certain 
individual extreme circumstances:
    (a) Cash assistance recipients, particularly long-term recipients;
    (b) Unemployed refugees who are not receiving cash assistance; and
    (c) Employed refugees in need of services to retain employment or to 
attain economic independence.


<R05>
Sec. 400.315  General eligibility requirements.

    (a) For purposes of determining eligibility of refugees for services 
under this subpart, the same standards and criteria shall be applied as 
are applied in the determination of eligibility for

[[Page 306]]

refugee social services under Secs. 400.150 and 400.152(a).
    (b) A State may not provide services under this subpart, except for 
referral and interpreter services, to refugees who have been in the 
United States for more than 60 months, except that refugees who are 
receiving employability services, as defined in Sec. 400.316, as of 
September 30, 1995, as part of an employability plan, may continue to 
receive those services through September 30, 1996, or until the services 
are completed, whichever occurs first, regardless of their length of 
residence in the U.S.


<R05>
Sec. 400.316  Scope of targeted assistance services.

    A State may provide the same scope of services under this subpart as 
may be provided to refugees under Secs. 400.154 and 400.155, with the 
exception of Sec. 400.155(h).


<R05>
Sec. 400.317  Service requirements.

    In providing targeted assistance services to refugees, a State must 
adhere to the same requirements as are applied to the provision of 
refugee social services under Sec. 400.156.


<R05>
Sec. 400.318  Eligible grantees.

    Eligible grantees are those agencies of State governments which are 
responsible for the refugee program under 45 CFR 400.5 in States 
containing counties which qualify for targeted assistance awards. The 
use of targeted assistance funds for services to Cuban and Haitian 
entrants is limited to States which have an approved State plan under 
the Cuban/Haitian Entrant Program (CHEP).


<R05>
Sec. 400.319  Allocation of funds.

    (a) A State with more than one qualifying targeted assistance county 
may allocate its targeted assistance funds differently from the formula 
allocations for counties presented in the ORR targeted assistance notice 
in a fiscal year only on the basis of its population of refugees who 
arrived in the U.S. during the most recent 5-year period. A State may 
use welfare data as an additional factor in the allocation of targeted 
assistance funds if it so chooses; however, a State may not assign a 
greater weight to welfare data than it has assigned to population data 
in its allocation formula.
    (b) A State must assure that not less than 95 percent of the total 
award to the State is made available to the qualified county or 
counties, except in those cases where the qualified county or counties 
have agreed to let the State administer the targeted assistance program 
in the county's stead.

eligible legalized aliens meeting the conditions in (e)(2) of this 
section, are enrolled in elementary or secondary public or non-public 
schools in that local educational agency's jurisdiction in that fiscal 
year or if such eligible legalized aliens represent at least 3 percent

funds received by the local educational agency with respect to such 
eligible legalized aliens pursuant to section 606 of the Emergency 
Immigrant Education Act.
    (f) Funds provided under this part may not be used to provide 
assistance under the programs of financial assistance from which 
eligible legalized aliens are barred by section 245A(h)(1), 210(f), or 
210A(d)(6) of the INA. However, such funds may be used for the State and 
local share of the costs of providing such assistance to eligible 
legalized aliens who are excepted from the bar by section 245A(h) (2) or 
(3), 210(f), or 210A(d)(6) of the INA, provided that such individuals 
are otherwise eligible for benefits under such programs, and that the 
costs of providing those benefits are otherwise allowable under the Act, 
this regulation, and the State's approved application.

pay costs inurred by any public or private entity or any individual, in

the adjustment of status of aliens to that of lawful temporary or 
permanent residence. This prohibition includes assisting an alien to 
appeal INS decisions or representation of an alien before any 
administrative or judicial body.
    (j) Funds under this part shall not be used to investigate or

made to it under this part for FY 1989 and succeeding fiscal years. The 
maximum amount that a State may use for this purpose from a fiscal 
year's allotment is the greater of 1% of its allotment for that fiscal 
year or $100,000.
    (l) A State may use funds to make payments for employment

    (n)(1) Except as provided for in paragraph (n)(2) of this section, a 
State may use SLIAG funds alloted to it for a fiscal year to reimburse 
or pay only those SLIAG-related costs for employment discrimination 
education and outreach activities which occurred after approval by the 
Department of an application or amendment describing those activities, 
as required by Sec. 402.41(d).
    (2) Costs incurred in FY 1990 prior to approval by the Department of 
an application or amendment containing the information required by 
Sec. 402.41(d), but after December 18, 1989, for reproduction and 
dissemination of public information material certified by the Office of 
the Special Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair Employment Practices, 
Department of Justice (hereafter, ``Office of the Special Counsel''), 
pursuant to paragraph (o) of this section may be reimbursed with funds 
allotted under this part.
    (o)(1) With respect to employment discrimination education and

Office of the Special Counsel that information contained in such 
materials relating to the discrimination provision of the Act is legally 
accurate and that those materials include reference to the Office of the 
Special Counsel as a source of information and referral for complaints 
of discrimination based on citizenship status or national origin. 
Information regarding the Office of the Special Counsel shall include 
its address and telephone number, including the toll-free number and

to FY 1988 SLIAG funds.

[56 FR 19808, Apr. 30, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 402.21  Fiscal control.

    (a) Fiscal control and accounting procedures must be sufficient to 
permit preparation of reports required by the Act, this regulation, and 
other applicable statutes and regulations.
    (b) States must have accounting procedures in place which allow 
funds provided under this part to be traced from drawdown to allowable 
SLIAG-related costs. Allowability of the amount and purpose of 
expenditures must be established for each recipient of SLIAG funds. 
States must demonstrate that SLIAG-related costs, as defined in this 
part, incurred in SLIAG-reimbursable activities, equal or exceed the 
amount of SLIAG funds expended with respect to costs incurred in those 
activities. Documentation of the method of accounting and appropriate 
supporting information must be available for audit purposes and for 
Federal program reviews. To establish allowability of expenditures, 
States may use methods prescribed in (c) of this section. Alternatively, 
the State may use any other reliable method of cost calculation, subject 
to Federal review.

[[Page 314]]

    (c)(1) For public assistance, States may establish allowability by 
accounting for actual expenditures made to or on behalf of identifiable 
eligible legalized aliens who qualify for and receive assistance and/or 
services from the recipient, or by use of a statistically valid sampling 
of a recipient's public assistance caseload.
    (2) For public health assistance, States may establish allowability 
by accounting for actual expenditures made to or on behalf of 
identifiable eligible legalized aliens, or applicants for lawful 
temporary resident status under sections 210, 210A, or 245A of the INA, 
who qualify for and receive such assistance and/or services, by use of a 
statistically valid sampling of clients in the public health system of 
the State or local government, or by using the ratio of eligible 
legalized aliens in a service population to all members of the relevant 
service population.
    (3) For educational services, States must be able to demonstrate 
that:
    (i) Funds provided under this part were used to provide educational 
services, as defined in this part, to eligible legalized aliens, as 
defined in this part; and,
    (ii) Payments to local educational agencies or other providers of 
educational services, as described in section 204(c)(3)(C) of the Act, 
did not exceed the amounts described in Sec. 402.11(e) of this part.
    (4) With respect to Phase II outreach, as defined in this part, a 
State must demonstrate that the costs of activities that provide 
information directly to specific individuals are attributable only to 
lawful temporary residents under sections 210, 210A, or 245A of the INA, 
and applicants for such status whose applications were pending with the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service at the time information is 
provided. For Phase II outreach activities that do not involve the 
provision of information directly to specific individuals, States must 
demonstrate that such activities are targeted predominantly to or 
intended primarily for lawful temporary residents under sections 210, 
210A, or 245A of the INA or applicants for such status whose 
applications are pending with the Immigration and Naturalization Service 
at the time information is provided. The State must demonstrate that the 
amount of any fiscal year's allotment used for this purpose did not 
exceed the amount described in Sec. 402.11(k) and was consistent with 
the limitations of Sec. 402.11(i).
    (5) With respect to employment discrimination education and 
outreach, as defined in this part, the State must demonstrate that funds 
were expended only for activities described in the State's approved 
application pursuant to Sec. 402.41(d) and the limitations of 
Sec. 402.11 (i), (n), and (o) and that the amount of any fiscal year's 
allotment used for this purpose did not exceed the amount described in 
Sec. 402.11(1).
    (6)(i) For program administrative costs, as defined in this part, a 
State may establish allowability by use of the proportion of eligible 
legalized aliens provided assistance and/or services allowable under 
this part by a recipient, as defined in this part, relative to all 
persons provided such assistance and/or services; by use of the 
proportion of program or service costs actually incurred in providing 
assistance and/or services allowable under this part by a recipient, 
relative to all costs of providing the same assistance and/or services 
allowable under this part by the recipient; or by use of such other 
basis as will document that administrative costs incurred in providing 
such assistance and/or services and reimbursed under this part are 
allowable, allocable to SLIAG, and reasonable.
    (ii) Consistent with section 604 of the Emergency Immigrant 
Education Act, of the amount paid to a State educational agency for 
educational services, only 1.5 percent may be used for administrative 
costs incurred by the State educational agency in carrying out its 
function under this part.

Sec. 402.30  Basis of awards.

    The Secretary will award funds in a fiscal year under Sec. 402.31 or 
Sec. 402.33 to States with approved applications for that fiscal year in 
accordance with the apportionment of funds from the Office of Management 
and Budget. The Secretary will award funds under Sec. 402.34 to States 
whose annual reports submitted pursuant to Sec. 402.51 establish that 
their allowable SLIAG-related costs exceed the total of their 
allotments, as determined under Sec. 402.31 and Sec. 402.33. The grant 
award constitutes the authority to draw and expend funds for the 
purposes set forth in the Act and this regulation.

<R05>
Sec. 402.31  Determination of allocations.

    (a) Allocation formula. Allocations will be computed according to a 
formula using the following factors and weights:
    (1) 50 percent based on the State's eligible legalized alien 
population, with 49 percent based upon the number of eligible legalized 
aliens in a State relative to the number of such aliens in all States, 
and 1 percent to States which have higher-than-average ratios of 
eligible legalized aliens to total population relative to the average 
for all States, based on the proportional number of such aliens; and
    (2) 50 percent based on the ratio of SLIAG-related costs in a State 
to the total of all such costs in all States.
    (b) Calculation of allocations. (1) Each time the Department 
calculates State allocations, it will use the best data then available 
to the Secretary on the distribution of eligible legalized aliens by 
State.
    (2) For all years except fiscal years 1993 and 1994, the Department 
will determine each State's SLIAG-related costs to be included in the 
computation of its allocation for a fiscal year by adding to the sum of 
SLIAG-related costs reported for all previous fiscal years by that 
State, pursuant to Sec. 402.51(e) (1) and (2), the total amount of 
estimated SLIAG-related costs included in the State's approved 
application for that fiscal year, pursuant to Sec. 402.41(c) (1) and 
(2). For fiscal years 1993 and 1994, the Department will add to the 
amount of estimated SLIAG-related costs included in the State's approved 
applications for fiscal years 1993 and 1994, respectively, the sum of 
SLIAG-related costs for all previous years ending with FY 1991 (for FY 
1993 applications) or FY 1992 (for FY 1994 applications), and the first 
and second

[[Page 316]]

quarters of FY 1992 (for FY 1993 applications) or FY 1993 (for FY 1994 
applications), pursuant to Sec. 402.52(e)(4). In the event that a State 
has not submitted an approved report for a fiscal year, the Department 
will include no costs for that fiscal year in its calculation.

Sec. 402.32  Determination of state allotments.

    Except as noted below, a State's allotment is the difference between 
the amount determined under Sec. 402.31(b) of this regulation and the 
cumulative amount previously allotted to the State. In the event that 
the amount determined under Sec. 402.31(b) is less than the cumulative 
amount previously allotted to a State, that State's allotment will be 
zero. The allotments of the remaining States would be calculated by 
multiplying the difference between the amount determined under 
Sec. 402.31(b) of this regulation and the cumulative amount previously 
allotted to the State by the ratio of the amount of funds available for 
grants to States to the sum of the differences between the amounts 
determined under Sec. 402.31(b) and the amounts previously awarded to 
those States.

designated allocation amount because it indicated in its application 
that it does not intend to use, in the fiscal year for which the 
application is made or in any succeeding fiscal year before FY 1995, the 
full amount of its allocation, funds which would otherwise have been 
allotted to the State in that fiscal year shall be allotted among the 
remaining States submitting timely approved applications in proportion 
to the amount that otherwise would have been allotted to such State in 
that fiscal year.

awarded to States under Sec. 402.31 and Sec. 402.33 of this part, will 
be allocated to States with unreimbursed SLIAG-related costs, as defined 
in this part.
    (b) To determine the allocations, the ratio of each State's 
unreimbursed SLIAG-related costs to the total of all such costs in all 
States will be calculated. The ratio for each State with unreimbursed 
SLIAG-related costs will be multiplied by total unexpended funds to 
determine the allocation for each State. The amount allotted to a State 
will be the amount of the State's allocation under this section or the 
amount of the State's unreimbursed SLIAG-related costs, whichever is 
less.

    (b) Contain information on the number of eligible legalized aliens 
residing in the State. A State may either (1) adopt as its official 
State-level estimate the estimate of the State's number of eligible 
legalized aliens provided by the Department, or (2) provide its own 
estimate, including detailed information on the method and data used in 
deriving the estimate. If a State has previously provided this 
information to the Department, it need not be included in the 
application unless the information has changed.
    (c) Contain an estimate of likely SLIAG-related costs for the fiscal 
year for which application is being made for each program or activity in 
which SLIAG-related costs will be incurred. Programs and activities must 
be identified by the purposes listed in Sec. 402.10(a). Such estimates 
for FY 1988 should include, as a discrete subset, costs incurred in FY 
1987, pursuant to Sec. 402.12.
    (d) Contain the following information pertaining to the estimates 
required by paragraph (c) of this section (the application must include 
sufficient detail to permit assessment by the Department of the

or the text of any material intended for distribution to the public to 
be produced or disseminated with SLIAG funds, if available at the time 
the application is submitted.
    (2) Descriptions of the methodologies used to determine SLIAG-
related cost. This description is to include (i) the methodology used in 
determining the proportion (or actual number) of eligible legalized 
aliens who are likely to participate in or benefit from the program or 
service, and (ii) a description of how a unit or other measure of the 
cost of providing services or benefits was calculated, or, if the 
estimate is based on actual cost data, a description of how the data 
were obtained. For SLIAG administrative costs, Phase II outreach, and 
employment discrimination education and outreach, the descriptions must 
instead include the basis for the estimate of SLIAG-related costs, as

    (b) The Department will assess the reasonableness of each State's 
estimates of SLIAG-related costs, as required by Sec. 402.41(c) (1) and 
(2), based on the following:
    (1) Are the activities for which estimates are included in the 
application allowable under the Act and this part?

the activities for which estimates of SLIAG-related costs are included 
in the application and other assumptions underlying the cost estimates 
based on reliable empirical data?
    (3) To what extent are the estimates based on actual costs incurred? 
Are actual costs based on methodologies described in this part or other 
methodologies likely to result in valid measures of SLIAG-related costs?
    (4) Do current estimates appear to be consistent with past 
estimates, known actual costs pursuant to Sec. 402.41(c)(2), and current 
INS eligible legalized alien population data?
    (5) Are revised estimates a result (all or in part) of changes in

has been approved or (2) its application has been disapproved, together 
with the reasons for disapproval.
    (d)(1) The Department will forward to the Office of Special Counsel

Sec. 402.45  Amendments to applications.

    (a)(1) If, during the course of a fiscal year, a State adds a 
program or activity for which it intends to claim reimbursement or make 
payment in that fiscal year, it must submit an amendment (containing 
appropriate information pursuant to Sec. 402.41(c)) to its approved 
application for that fiscal year prior to the due date for reports 
required by Sec. 402.51 of this part.
    (2) If a State plans to initiate employment discrimination education 
and outreach activities not described in its application pursuant to 
Sec. 402.41(d), it must submit an application amendment, which shall be 
reviewed in accordance with procedures described in Sec. 402.41(d) of 
this part. The Department's approval of such an amendment is a 
prerequisite for the initiation of such new activities, except as 
provided for in Sec. 402.11(n) (2).
    (b) Except as provided for in Sec. 402.11(k) and (n), a State may 
use SLIAG funds received for a fiscal year to reimburse or pay SLIAG 
related costs for programs or activities described in paragraph (a) of 
this section retroactive to the date the activity began, but no earlier 
than the first day of the fiscal year and only to the extent described 
in Sec. 402.10(d), except that funds received in FY 1992, if any, may be 
used for costs incurred on or after October 1, 1989. Costs incurred 
prior to October 1, 1987, are allowable only to the extent described in 
Sec. 402.12.

<R05>
Sec. 402.50  Recordkeeping.

    A State must provide for the maintenance of such records as are 
necessary:
    (a) To meet the requirements of the Act and Department regulations 
relating to retention of and access to records.
    (b) To allow the State to provide to the Department (1) an accurate 
description of its activities undertaken with SLIAG funds, and (2) a 
complete record of the purposes for which SLIAG funds were spent, and of 
the recipients of such funds; and
    (c) To allow the Department and auditors of the State to determine 
the extent to which SLIAG funds were expended consistent with the Act 
and this regulation.


<R05>
Sec. 402.51  Reporting.

    (a)(1) After the end of each Federal fiscal year through FY 1994 for

containing the information identified in (c) and (e) of this section. 
The reports are due no later than 90 days after the end of a Federal

submit a report containing the information identified in paragraph (e) 
of this section. The report is due no later than December 29, 1994.
    (b)(1) Failure to submit the annual report required in (a) of this 
section by the deadline, without prior written permission from the 
Secretary, constitutes a basis for withholding of SLIAG funds.
    (2) Failure by a State to submit the required information prior to 
the calculation of allocations pursuant to Subpart D will result in the 
Secretary's including no SLIAG-related costs for the fiscal year for 
that State in the calculation of State allocations.
    (c) A State's annual report must provide information on the status 
of each fiscal year's funds, as of September 30, for the fiscal year for 
funds received under Sec. 402.31 and Sec. 402.33, including:
    (1) Identification of the amount obligated and the amount expended 
by the State grantee agency;
    (2) Identification of any amount remaining unobligated at the end of 
the fiscal year which the State intends to carry over to succeeding 
fiscal years; and,
    (3) Identification of any amount remaining unobligated at the end of 
the fiscal year which the State does not desire to carry over to the 
succeeding fiscal year.
    (d) A State must use SF-269 in its reporting under paragraph (c) of 
this section, but it may determine the format

[[Page 320]]

of its annual report content under paragraph (e) of this section.
    (e)(1) For all years except fiscal years 1992 and 1993, a State's 
annual report must also provide the actual SLIAG-related costs incurred 
during the fiscal year. The report must provide, for each program or 
activity identified in the State's application, the amount of SLIAG-
related costs, as defined in this part, incurred in that program or 
activity, identified as public assistance, public health assistance, 
educational services, Phase II outreach, employment discrimination 
education and outreach, and SLIAG administrative costs, as defined in 
this part, the amount of SLIAG funds obligated for that program or 
activity, and the time period for which the funds were obligated.
    (2) The report must contain a description of the methodology used to 
determine actual SLIAG-related costs, if different from the description 
provided in the State's application pursuant to Sec. 402.41 (d) (2) of 
this part.
    (3) Federal and State costs of providing assistance under a State 
plan approved under title XIX of the Social Security Act to aliens whose 
status has been adjusted under sections 245A and 210A of the INA by 
virtue of the exceptions to the bar to Medicaid eligibility (sections 
245A (h) (2) and (3) of the INA) must be shown separately in States' 
reports.
    (4) For fiscal years 1992 and 1993, a State must report actual 
SLIAG-related costs, pursuant to paragraphs (e) (1), (2) and (3) of this 
section, for the first and second quarters, along with its application
