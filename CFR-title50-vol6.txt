                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, October 1, 2007), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in 11 separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

                         Subpart A_Introduction


<R05>
Sec. 18.1  Purpose of regulations.

    The regulations contained in this part implement the Marine Mammal 
Protection Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1361-1407), which among other things, 
restricts the taking, possession, transportation, selling, offering for 
sale, and importing of marine mammals.


<R05>
Sec. 18.2  Scope of regulations.

    (a) This part 18 applies solely to marine mammals and marine mammal 
products as defined in Sec. 18.3. For regulations under the Act with 
respect to cetacea (whales and porpoises), pinnipedia, other than walrus 
(seals and sea lions), see 50 CFR part 216.
    (b) The provisions in this part are in addition to, and are not in 
lieu of, other regulations of this subchapter B which may require a 
permit or prescribe additional restrictions or conditions for the 
importation, exportation, and interstate transportation of wildlife. 
(See also part 13 of this subchapter.)


<R05>
Sec. 18.3  Definitions.

    In addition to definitions contained in section 3 of the Act and in 
part 10 of this subchapter, and unless the context requires otherwise, 
in this part 18:
    Act means the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, 86 Stat. 1027, 
16 U.S.C. 1361-1407; Pub. L. 92-522.
    Alaskan Native means a person defined in the Alaska Native Claims 
Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. section 1603(b) (85 Stat. 588)) as a citizen 
of the United States who is of one-fourth degree or more Alaska Indian 
(including Tsimshian Indians enrolled or not enrolled in the Metlaktla 
Indian Community), Eskimo, or Aleut blood, or combination thereof. The 
term includes any Native, as so defined, either or both of whose 
adoptive parents are not Natives. It also includes, in the absence of 
proof of a minimum blood quantum, any citizen of the United States who 
is regarded as an Alaska Native by the Native village or town of which 
he claims to be a member and whose father or mother is (or, if deceased, 
was) regarded as Native by any Native village or Native town. Any 
citizen enrolled by the Secretary pursuant to section 5 of the Alaska 
Native Claims Settlement Act shall be conclusively presumed to be an 
Alaskan Native for purposes of this part.
    Authentic native articles of handicrafts and clothing means items 
made by an Indian, Aleut, or Eskimo that (a) are composed wholly or in 
some significant respect of natural materials and (b) are significantly 
altered from their natural form and are produced, decorated, or 
fashioned in the exercise of traditional native handicrafts without the 
use of pantographs, multiple carvers, or similar mass-copying devices. 
Improved methods of production utilizing modern implements such as 
sewing machines or modern techniques at a tannery registered pursuant to 
Sec. 18.23(c) may be used so long as no large-scale mass-production 
industry results. Traditional native handicrafts include, but are not 
limited to, weaving, carving, stitching, sewing, lacing, beading, 
drawing, and painting. The formation of traditional native groups, such 
as cooperatives, is permitted so long as no large-scale mass production 
results.
    Commercial fishing operation means the lawful harvesting of fish 
from the marine environment for profit as part of an on-going business 
enterprise. Such term shall not include sport fishing activities whether 
or not carried out by charter boat or otherwise, and whether or not the 
fish so caught are subsequently sold.
    Endangered species means a species of marine mammal listed as 
``endangered'' pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, 87 Stat. 
884, Pub. L. 93-205 (see part 17 of this subchapter).
    Incidental catch means the taking of a marine mammal (a) because it 
is directly interfering with commercial fishing operations, or (b) as a 
consequence of the steps used to secure the fish in connection with 
commercial fishing operations: Provided, however, That a marine mammal 
so taken must immediately be returned to the sea with a minimum of 
injury; and Provided, further, That the taking of a marine mammal which 
otherwise meets the requirements of this definition shall not be 
considered as incidental catch of that mammal if it is used subsequently 
to assist in commercial fishing operations.

[[Page 7]]

    Marine mammal means any specimen of the following species, whether 
alive or dead, and any part thereof, including but not limited to, any 
raw, dressed, or dyed fur or skin:

applications, including an appropriate apportionment of overhead and 
administrative expenses of the Department of Interior.
    (e) Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this section, 
whenever, under the Act, the Secretary determines any species or stock 
of marine mammals to be depleted, he may prescribe regulations pursuant 
to section 103 of the Act upon the taking of such marine mammals by any 
Indian, Aleut, or Eskimo and, after promulgation of such regulations, 
all takings of such marine mammals by such person shall conform to such 
regulations.
    (f) Marking, tagging, and reporting. (1) In addition to definitions 
contained in the Act, 50 CFR 18.3, and 50 CFR 18.27, in this paragraph 
(f):
    (i) The term ``marking and tagging'' of marine mammals as specified 
in section 109(i) of the Act refers to the actual physical attachment of 
an approved band or other such marking device or technique to the raw or 
unhandicrafted (including unmarked tanned skins) skin and skull of polar 
bears, the tusks of walruses, and the skin and skull of sea otters; and
    (ii) The term ``reporting'' means the collection by Service 
personnel or the Service's authorized local representatives of 
biological data, harvest data, and other information regarding the 
effect of taking of marine mammals on populations, the collection of 
which the Service determines to be necessary for management purposes. 
Reporting will be done on forms provided by the Service upon 
presentation for marking, tagging, and reporting purposes of the marine 
mammal(s) or specified raw or unhandicrafted parts thereof.
    (2) Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this section, but 
subject to the provisions and conditions contained in this paragraph, no 
polar bear, walrus, or sea otter, or any parts thereof, taken or 
collected by an Alaskan Native for subsistence purposes or for purposes 
of creating and selling authentic Native articles of handicrafts and 
clothing may be possessed, transported within, or exported from Alaska 
unless the animal(s), or specified parts thereof, have been reported to, 
and properly marked and tagged by, Service personnel or the Service's 
authorized local representative; except:
    (i) An Alaskan Native that harvested or participated in the harvest 
of a polar bear, sea otter, or walrus and who possesses the animal, or 
any parts thereof, may possess the unmarked, untagged, and unreported 
animal(s), or parts thereof, for a period of time not to exceed 30 days 
from the time of taking for the purpose of transporting the specified 
parts to Service personnel or the Service's local authorized 
representative for marking, tagging, and reporting;
    (ii) Alaskan Natives and registered agents/tanneries may possess the 
specified unmarked or untagged raw, unhandicrafted, or tanned parts 
thereof for a period of time not to exceed 180 days from the effective 
date of this rulemaking for the purpose of transporting to Service 
personnel or the Service's local authorized representative for marking 
and tagging if the specified parts thereof were taken or possessed 
between December 21, 1972, and the effective date of this regulation. 
There is no reporting requirement for marine mammals, or specified parts 
thereof, covered by this paragraph.
    (3) Those unmarked, untagged, and unreported specified parts of 
polar bear, walrus, and sea otter, that must be presented to Service 
personnel or an authorized Service representative for

[[Page 12]]

marking, tagging, and reporting are as follows:
    (i) Polar bear--skin and skull.
    (ii) Walrus--tusks.
    (iii) Sea otter--skin and skull.
    (4) The locations where Service personnel or the Service's 
authorized local representative will be available for marking, tagging, 
and reporting purposes will be announced annually by the Alaska Regional 
Director. Local persons authorized to act as representatives for 
marking, tagging, and reporting purposes in the absence of Service 
personnel will also be announced annually by the Alaska Regional 
Director.
    (5) Marks and tags will be attached or applied to the skins, skulls, 
and tusks of the marine mammal(s) in such a manner as to maximize their 
longevity and minimize their adverse effects to the appearance of the 
specified parts that might result due to hindering the tanning or 
handicrafting of skins, or the handicrafting of tusks or skulls. If the 
tag or mark comes off of the specified part the person in possession of 
the part shall have 30 days to present the part and broken tag or other 
marking device to the Service or the Service's authorized local 
representative for remarking or retagging purposes.
    (6) Marks and tags for skins, skulls, and tusks will be provided by 
the Service. They will be numbered for accountability and of such 
design, construction, and material so as to maximize their durability 
and longevity on the specified parts.
    (7) Data collected pursuant to this paragraph will be reported on 
forms provided by the Service and maintained in the Service's Regional 
Office, Anchorage, Alaska. The Service will summarize the data annually 
and make it publicly available. The data will also be included in the 
Service's annual report to Congress as set forth in section 103(f) of 
the Act.
    (8) All items of research (e.g., radio collars, satellite 
transmitters, tags, etc.) that were attached to animals taken by Alaskan 
Natives must be returned to Service personnel or an authorized Service 
representative at the time the animal, or specified unhandicrafted parts 
thereof, are presented for marking, tagging, and reporting. No penalty 
will be imposed under the Act for a violation of this paragraph.

Sec. 18.24  Taking incidental to commercial fishing operations.

    Persons may take marine mammals incidental to commercial fishing 
operations until October 21, 1974: Provided, That such taking is by 
means of equipment and techniques prescribed in regulations issued by 
the Secretary of Commerce. However, any marine mammal taken as an 
incidental catch may not be retained. It shall be the immediate goal 
that the incidental kill or incidental serious injury of marine mammals 
permitted in the course of commercial fishing operations be reduced to 
insignificant levels approaching a zero mortality and serious injury 
rate.


<R05>
Sec. 18.25  Exempted marine mammals or marine mammal products.

    (a) The provisions of the Act and these regulations shall not apply:

<R05>
Sec. 18.27  Regulations governing small takes of marine mammals 

incidental to specified activities.

    (a) Purpose of regulations. The regulations in this section 
implement Section 101(a)(5) of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, 
as amended, 16 U.S.C. 1371(a)(5), which provides a mechanism for 
allowing, upon request, during periods of not more than five consecutive 
years each, the incidental, but not intentional, taking of small numbers 
of marine mammals by U.S. citizens who engage in a specified activity 
(other than commercial fishing) within a specified geographical region.
    (b) Scope of regulations. The taking of small numbers of marine 
mammals under section 101(a)(5) of the Marine Mammal Protection Act may 
be allowed only if the Director of the Fish and Wildlife Service (1) 
finds, based on the best scientific evidence available, that the total 
taking during the specified time period will have a negligible impact on 
the species or stock and will not have an unmitigable adverse impact on 
the availability of the species or stock for subsistence uses; (2) 
prescribes regulations setting forth permissible methods of taking and 
other means of effecting the least practicable adverse impact on the 
species and its habitat and on the availability of the species for 
subsistence uses, paying particular attention to rookeries, mating 
grounds, and areas of similar significance; and (3) prescribes 
regulations pertaining to the monitoring and reporting of such taking.
    Note: The information collection requirement contained in this Sec. 
18.27 has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 
U.S.C. 3501 et seq. and assigned clearance No. 1018-0070. The 
information is being collected to describe the activity proposed and 
estimate the cumulative impacts of potential takings by all persons 
conducting the activity. The information will be used to evaluate the 
application and determine whether to issue Specific Regulations and, 
subsequently, Letters of Authorization. Response is required to obtain a 
benefit.
    The public reporting burden from this requirement is estimated to 
vary from 2 to 200 hours per response with an average of 10 hours per 
response including time for reviewing instructions, gathering and 
maintaining data, and completing and reviewing applications for specific 
regulations and Letters of Authorization. Direct comments regarding the 
burden estimate or any other aspect of this requirement to the 
Information Collection Clearance Officer, U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service, Department of the Interior, Mail Stop--220 ARLSQ, 18th and C 
Streets NW., Washington, DC 20240, and the Office of Management and 
Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project (Clearance No. 1018-0070), 
Washington, DC 20503.
    (c) Definitions. In addition to definitions contained in the Act and 
in 50 CFR 18.3 and unless the context otherwise requires, in this 
section:
    Citizens of the United States and U.S. citizens mean individual U.S. 
citizens or any corporation or similar entity if it is organized under 
the laws of the United States or any governmental unit defined in 16 
U.S.C. 1362(13). U.S. Federal, State and local government

[[Page 15]]

agencies shall also constitute citizens of the United States for 
purposes of this section.
    Incidental, but not intentional, taking means takings which are 
infrequent, unavoidable, or accidental. It does not mean that the taking 
must be unexpected. (Complete definition of take is contained in 50 CFR 
18.3.)
    Negligible impact is an impact resulting from the specified activity 
that cannot be reasonably expected to, and is not reasonably likely to, 
adversely affect the species or stock through effects on annual rates of 
recruitment or survival.
    Small numbers means a portion of a marine mammal species or stock 
whose taking would have a negligible impact on that species or stock.
    Specified activity means any activity, other than commercial 
fishing, which takes place in a specified geographical region and 
potentially involves the taking of small numbers of marine mammals. The 
specified activity and specified geographical region should be 
identified so that the anticipated effects on marine mammals will be 
substantially similar.
    Specified geographical region means an area within which a specified 
activity is conducted and which has similar biogeographic 
characteristics.
    Unmitigable adverse impact means an impact resulting from the 
specified activity (1) that is likely to reduce the availability of the 
species to a level insufficient for a harvest to meet subsistence needs 
by (i) causing the marine mammals to abandon or avoid hunting areas, 
(ii) directly displacing subsistence users, or (iii) placing physical 
barriers between the marine mammals and the subsistence hunters; and (2) 
that cannot be sufficiently mitigated by other measures to increase the 
availability of marine mammals to allow subsistence needs to be met.
    (d) Submission of requests. (1) In order for the Fish and Wildlife 
Service to consider allowing the taking by U.S citizens of small numbers 
of marine mammals incidental to a specified activity, a written request 
must be submitted to the Director, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 
Department of the Interior, Washington, DC 20240. Requests shall include 
the following information on the activity as a whole, which includes, 
but is not limited to, an assessment of total impacts by all persons 
conducting the activity:
    (i) A description of the specific activity or class of activities 
that can be expected to result in incidental taking of marine mammals;
    (ii) The dates and duration of such activity and the specific 
geographical region where it will occur;
    (iii) Based upon the best available scientific information;
    (A) An estimate of the species and numbers of marine mammals likely 
to be taken by age, sex, and reproductive conditions, and the type of 
taking (e.g., disturbance by sound, injury or death resulting from 
collision, etc.) and the number of times such taking is likely to occur;
    (B) A description of the status, distribution, and seasonal 
distribution (when applicable) of the affected species or stocks likely 
to be affected by such activities;
    (C) The anticipated impact of the activity upon the species or 
stocks;
    (D) The anticipated impact of the activity on the availability of 
the species or stocks for subsistence uses;
    (iv) The anticipated impact of the activity upon the habitat of the 
marine mammal populations and the likelihood of restoration of the 
affected habitat;
    (v) The anticipated impact of the loss or modification of the 
habitat on the marine mammal population involved;
    (vi) The availability and feasibility (economic and technological) 
of equipment, methods, and manner of conducting such activity or other 
means of effecting the least practicable adverse impact upon the 
affected species or stocks, their habitat, and, where relevant, on their 
availability for subsistence uses, paying particular attention to 
rookeries, mating grounds, and areas of similar significance. (The 
applicant and those conducting the specified activity and the affected 
subsistence users are encouraged to develop mutually agreeable 
mitigating measures that will meet the needs of subsistence users.);
    (vii) Suggested means of accomplishing the necessary monitoring and 
reporting which will result in increased

[[Page 16]]

knowledge of the species through an analysis of the level of taking or 
impacts and suggested means of minimizing burdens by coordinating such 
reporting requirements with other schemes already applicable to persons 
conducting such activity; and
    (viii) Suggested means of learning of, encouraging, and coordinating 
research opportunities, plans and activities relating to reducing such 
incidental taking from such specified activities, and evaluating its 
effects.
    (2) The Director shall determine the adequacy and completeness of a 
request, and if found to be adequate, will invite information, 
suggestions, and comments on the preliminary finding of negligible 
impact and on the proposed specific regulations through notice in the 
Federal Register, newspapers of general circulation, and appropriate 
electronic media in the coastal areas that may be affected by such 
activity. All information and suggestions will be considered by the Fish 
and Wildlife Service in developing final findings and effective specific 
regulations.
    (3) The Director shall evaluate each request to determine, based on 
the best available scientific evidence, whether the total taking will 
have a negligible impact on the species or stock and, where appropriate, 
will not have an unmitigable adverse impact on the availability of such 
species or stock for subsistence uses. If the Director finds that 
mitigating measures would render the impact of the specified activity 
negligible when it would not otherwise satisfy that requirement, the 
Director may make a finding of negligible impact subject to such 
mitigating measures being successfully implemented. Any preliminary 
findings of ``negligible impact'' and ``no unmitigable adverse impact'' 
shall be proposed for public comment along with the proposed specific 
regulations.
    (4) If the Director cannot make a finding that the total taking will 
have a negligible impact in the species or stock or will not have an 
unmitigable adverse impact on the availability of such species or stock 
for subsistence uses, the Director shall publish in the Federal Register 
the negative finding along with the basis for denying the request.
    (e) Specific regulations. (1) Specific regulations will be 
established for each allowed activity which set forth (i) permissible 
methods of taking, (ii) means of effecting the least practicable adverse 
impact on the species and its habitat and on the availability of the 
species for subsistence uses, and (iii) requirements for monitoring and 
reporting.
    (2) Regulations will be established based on the best available 
scientific information. As new information is developed, through 
monitoring, reporting, or research, the regulations may be modified, in 
whole or part, after notice and opportunity for public review.
    (f) Letters of Authorization. (1) A Letter of Authorization, which 
may be issued only to U.S. citizens, is required to conduct activities 
pursuant to any specific regulations established. Requests for Letters 
of Authorization shall be submitted to the Director, U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service, Department of the Interior, Washington, DC 20240. The 
information to be submitted in a request may be obtained by writing the 
Director. Once specific regulations are effective, the Service will to 
the maximum extent possible, process subsequent applications for Letters 
of Authorization within 30 days after receipt of the application by the 
Service.
    (2) Issuance of a Letter of Authorization will be based on a 
determination that the level of taking will be consistent with the 
findings made for the total taking allowable under the specific 
regulations.
    (3) Notice of issuance of all Letters of Authorization will be 
published in the Federal Register within 30 days of issuance.
    (4) Letters of Authorization will specify the period of validity and 
any additional terms and conditions appropriate for the specific 
request.
    (5) Letters of Authorization shall be withdrawn or suspended, either 
on an individual or class basis, as appropriate, if, after notice and 
opportunity for public comment, the Director determines: (i) The 
regulations prescribed are not being substantially complied with, or 
(ii) the taking allowed is having, or may have, more

[[Page 17]]

than a negligible impact on the species or stock, or where relevant, an 
unmitigable adverse impact on the availability of the species or stock 
for subsistence uses.
    (6) The requirement for notice and opportunity for public review in 
paragraph (f)(5) of this section shall not apply if the Director 
determines that an emergency exists which poses a significant risk to 
the well-being of the species or stocks of marine mammals concerned.
    (7) A violation of any of the terms and conditions of a Letter of 
Authorization or of the specific regulations may subject the Holder and/
or any individual who is operating under the authority of the Holder's 
Letter of Authorization to penalties provided in the Marine Mammal 
Protection Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1361-1407).

[[Page 18]]

the NWT, that the bear was not taken while part of a family group.
    (b) Definitions. In addition to the definitions in this paragraph, 
the definitions in 50 CFR 10.12, 18.3, and 23.3 apply to this section.
    (1) Sport-hunted trophy means a mount, rug or other display item 
composed of the hide, hair, skull, teeth, baculum, bones, and claws of 
the specimen which was taken by the applicant or decedent during a sport 
hunt for personal, noncommercial use and does not include any internal 
organ of the animal, including the gall bladder. Articles made from the 
specimen, such as finished or unfinished, worked, manufactured, or 
handicraft items for use as clothing, curio, ornamentation, jewelry, or 
as a utilitarian item are not considered trophy items.
    (2) Management agreement means a written agreement between parties 
that share management responsibilities for a polar bear population which 
describes what portion of the harvestable quota will be allocated to 
each party and other measures which may be taken for the conservation of 
the population, such as harvest seasons, sex ratio of the harvest, and 
protection of females and cubs.
    (c) Procedures for issuance of permits and modification, suspension 
or revocation of permits. We, the Service, shall suspend, modify or 
revoke permits issued under this section:
    (1) In accordance with regulations contained in Sec. 18.33; and
    (2) If, in consultation with the appropriate authority in Canada, we 
determine that the sustainability of Canada's polar bear populations is 
being adversely affected or that sport hunting may be having a 
detrimental effect on maintaining polar bear populations throughout 
their range.
    (d) Issuance criteria. In deciding whether to issue an import permit 
for a sport-hunted trophy, we must determine in addition to the general 
criteria in part 13 of this subchapter whether:
    (1) You previously imported the specimen into the United States 
without a permit;
    (2) The specimen meets the definition of a sport-hunted trophy in 
paragraph (b) of this section;
    (3) You legally harvested the polar bear in Canada;
    (4) Canada has a monitored and enforced sport-hunting program 
consistent with the purposes of the 1973 International Agreement on the 
Conservation of Polar Bears;
    (5) Canada has a sport-hunting program, based on scientifically 
sound quotas, ensuring the maintenance of the affected population at a 
sustainable level; and
    (6) The export and subsequent import:
    (i) Are consistent with the provisions of the Convention on 
International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora 
(CITES) and other international agreements and conventions; and
    (ii) Are not likely to contribute to illegal trade in bear parts, 
including for bears taken after April 30, 1994, that the gall bladder 
and its contents were destroyed.
    (e) Additional permit conditions. Your permit to import a sport-
hunted trophy of a polar bear taken in Canada is subject to the permit 
conditions outlined in Sec. 18.31(d) and the following additional 
permit conditions:
    (1) You, the permittee, may not import internal organs of the polar 
bear, including the gall bladder;
    (2) After import you may not alter or use the trophy in a manner 
inconsistent with the definition of a sport-hunted polar bear trophy as 
given in Sec. 18.30(b);
    (3) You may not import a sport-hunted trophy if the polar bear at 
the time you or the decedent took it was:
    (i) A nursing bear or a female with nursing young (i.e., part of a 
family group);
    (ii) A pregnant female; or
    (iii) A bear moving into a den or in a den;
    (4) You must present to Service personnel at the time of import a 
valid CITES document from the country of export or re-export;
    (5) You must comply with the following import procedures:
    (i) Import the sport-hunted trophy through a designated port for 
wildlife imports (see Sec. 14.12 of this subchapter) during regular 
business hours, except for full mount trophies that have been

of this section prior to being cleared (see Sec. 14.52 of this 
subchapter);
    (6) You must import all parts of a single trophy at the same time;
    (7) The following tagging/marking procedures apply:
    (i) Service personnel must affix a permanently locking tag that 
contains a unique serial number and the common name ``polar bear'' to 
the hide which must remain fixed indefinitely to the hide as proof of 
legal import; and
    (ii) Service personnel must permanently mark upon import the parts 
of the trophy other than the hide, such as the skull and bones, with the 
hide tag number; and
    (8) If the tag comes off the hide, you must within 30 days:
    (i) Contact the nearest Service office at a designated port or a Law 
Enforcement office as given in Sec. 10.22 of this subchapter to 
schedule a time to present the trophy for retagging;
    (ii) Provide as proof that the trophy had been tagged and legally 
imported a copy of the:
    (A) Canceled CITES export permit or re-export certificate;
    (B) Canceled U.S. import permit issued under this section; or
    (C) Cleared wildlife declaration form (3-177); and
    (iii) Present either the broken tag, or if the tag was lost, a 
signed written explanation of how and when the tag was lost.
    (f) Duration of permits. The permit will be valid for no more than 
one year from the date of issuance.
    (g) Fees. (1) You must pay the standard permit processing fee as 
given in Sec. 13.11(4) when filing an application.
    (2) You must pay the issuance fee of $1,000 when we notify you the 
application is approved. We cannot issue an import permit until you pay 
this fee. We will use the issuance fee to develop and implement 
cooperative research and management programs for the conservation of 
polar bears in Alaska and Russia under section 113(d) of the Marine 
Mammal Protection Act.
    (h) Scientific review. (1) We will undertake a scientific review of 
the impact of permits issued under this section on the polar bear 
populations in Canada within 2 years of March 20, 1997.
    (i) The review will provide an opportunity for public comment and 
include a response to the public comment in the final report; and
    (ii) We will not issue permits under this section if we determine, 
based upon scientific review, that the issuance of permits under this 
section is having a significant adverse impact on the polar bear 
populations in Canada; and
    (2) After the initial review, we may review whether the issuance of 
permits under this section is having a significant adverse impact on the 
polar bear populations in Canada annually in light of the best 
scientific information available. The review must be completed no later 
than January 31 in any year a review is undertaken.
    (i) Findings. Polar bear sport-hunted trophies may only be imported 
after issuance of an import permit, and in accordance with the following 
findings and conditions:
    (1) We have determined that the Northwest Territories and Nunavut 
Territory, Canada, have a monitored and enforced sport-hunting program 
that meets issuance criteria of paragraphs (d) (4) and (5) of this 
section for the following populations: Southern Beaufort Sea, Northern 
Beaufort Sea, Viscount Melville Sound (subject to the lifting of the 
moratorium in this population), Western Hudson Bay, M'Clintock Channel 
(only for polar bears lawfully taken on or before May 31, 2000), 
Lancaster Sound, and Norwegian Bay, and that:
    (i) For the Southern Beaufort Sea population, no bears are taken 
west of the equidistant line of the Beaufort Sea;
    (ii) For all populations, females with cubs, cubs, or polar bears 
moving into denning areas or already in dens are protected from taking 
by hunting activities; and

[[Page 20]]

    (iii) For all populations, management agreements among all 
management entities with scientifically sound quotas are in place; and
    (2) Any sport-hunted trophy taken in the Northwest Territories, 
Canada, between December 21, 1972, and April 30, 1994, may be issued an 
import permit when:
    (i) From an approved population listed in paragraph (i)(1); and
    (ii) The issuance criteria of paragraph (d) (1), (2), (3), and (6) 
of this section are met.

    The Director may, upon receipt of an application and in accordance 
with the issuance criteria of this section, issue a permit authorizing 
the taking and importation of marine mammals for scientific research 
purposes or for public display.
    (a) Application procedure. Applications for permits to take and 
import marine mammals for scientific research purposes or for public 
display shall be submitted to the Director. Each such application must 
contain the general information and certification required by Sec. 
13.12(a) of this subchapter plus the following additional information:
    (1) A statement of the purpose, date, location and manner of the 
taking or importation;
    (2) A description of the marine mammal or the marine mammal products 
to be taken or imported, including the species or subspecies involved; 
the population stock, when known, the number of specimens or products 
(or the weight thereof, where appropriate); and the anticipated age, 
size, sex, and condition (i.e., whether pregnant or nursing) of the 
animals involved;
    (3) If the marine mammal is to be taken and transported alive, a 
complete description of the manner of transportation, care and 
maintenance, including the type, size, and construction of the container 
or artificial environment; arrangements for feeding and sanitation; a 
statement of the applicant's qualifications and previous experience in 
caring for and handling captive marine mammals and a like statement as 
to the qualifications of any common carrier or agent to be employed to 
transport the animal; and a written certification of a licensed 
veterinarian knowledgeable in the field of marine mammals that he has 
personally reviewed the arrangements for transporting and maintaining 
the animals and that in his opinion they are adequate to provide for the 
well-being of the animal;
    (4) If the application is for a scientific research permit, a 
detailed description of the scientific research project or program in 
which the marine mammal or marine mammal product is to be used including 
a copy of the research proposal relating to such program or project and 
the names and addresses of the sponsor or cooperating institution and 
the scientists involved;
    (5) If the application is for a scientific research permit, and if 
the marine mammal proposed to be taken or imported is listed as an 
endangered or threatened species or has been designated by the Secretary 
as depleted, a detailed justification of the need for such a marine 
mammal, including a discussion of possible alternatives, whether or not 
under the control of the applicant; and
    (6) If the application is for a public display permit, a detailed 
description of the proposed use to which the marine mammal or marine 
mammal product is to be put, including the manner, location, and times 
of display, whether such display is for profit, an estimate of the 
numbers and types of persons who it is anticipated will benefit for such 
display, and whether and to what extent the display is connected with 
educational or scientific programs. There shall also be included a 
complete description of the enterprise seeking the display permit and 
its educational, and scientific qualifications, if any.
    (b) Review by Marine Mammal Commission. Upon receipt of an 
application the Director shall forward the application to the Marine 
Mammal Commission together with a request for the recommendations of the 
Commission and the Committee of Scientific Advisors on Marine Mammals. 
In order to comply with the time limits provided in

[[Page 21]]

these regulations, the Director shall request that such recommendation 
be submitted within 30 days of receipt of the application by the 
Commission. If the Commission or the Committee, as the case may be, does 
not respond within 30 days from the receipt of such application by the 
Commission, the Director shall advise the Commission in writing that 
failure to respond within 45 days from original receipt of the 
application (or such longer time as the Director may establish) shall be 
considered as a recommendation from the Commission and the Committee 
that the permit be issued. The Director may also consult with any other 
person, institution or agency concerning the application.
    (c) Issuance criteria. Permits applied for under this section shall 
be issued, suspended, modified and revoked pursuant to regulations 
contained in Sec. 18.33. In determining whether to issue a scientific 
research permit, the Director shall consider whether the proposed taking 
or importation will be consistent with the policies and purposes of the 
Act; and whether the granting of the permit is required to further a 
bona fide and necessary or desirable scientific purpose, taking into 
account the benefits anticipated to be derived from the scientific 
research contemplated and the effect of the purposed taking or 
importation on the population stock and the marine ecosystem. In 
determining whether to issue a public display permit, the Director shall 
consider whether the proposed taking or importation will be consistent 
with the policies and purposes of the Act; whether a substantial public 
benefit will be gained from the display contemplated, taking into 
account the manner of the display and the anticipated audience on the 
one hand, and the effect of the proposed taking or importation on the 
population stocks of the marine mammal in question and the marine 
ecosystem on the other; and the applicant's qualifications for the 
proper care and maintenance of the marine mammal or the marine mammal 
product, and the adequacy of his facilities.
    (d) Additional permit conditions. In addition to the general 
conditions set forth in part 13 of this subchapter B, permits issued 
under this section shall be subject to the following conditions:
    (1) Any permit issued under these regulations must be in the 
possession of the person to whom it is issued (or an agent of such 
person) during:
    (i) The time of the authorized taking or importation;
    (ii) The period of any transit of such person or agent which is 
incidental to such taking or importation; and
    (iii) Any other time while any marine mammal taken or imported under 
such permit is in the possession of such person or agent.
    (2) A duplicate copy of the issued permit must be physically 
attached to the container, package, enclosure, or other means of 
containment, in which the marine mammal is placed for purposes of 
storage, transit, supervision, or care.
    (e) Tenure of permits. The tenure of permits for scientific research 
or public display shall be designated on the face of the permit.

    (a) The presiding officer may, in his discretion, provide for oral 
argument by parties at the end of the hearing. Such argument, when 
permitted, may be limited by the presiding officer to the extent 
necessary for the expeditious disposition of the proceeding.

[[Page 28]]

    (b) The presiding officer shall announce at the hearing a reasonable 
period of time within which any party may file with the presiding 
officer proposed findings and conclusions and written arguments or 
briefs, which are based upon the record and citing where practicable the 
relevant page or pages of the transcript. If a party filing a brief 
desires the presiding officer to reconsider any objection made by such 
party to a ruling of the presiding officer, he shall specifically 
identify such rulings by reference to the pertinent pages of the 
transcript and shall state his arguments thereon as a part of the brief.
    (c) Oral or written arguments shall be limited to issues arising 
from direct testimony on the record.

<R05>
Sec. 18.124  How do I obtain a Letter of Authorization?

    (a) You must be a U.S. citizen as defined in Sec. 18.27(c).
    (b) If you are conducting an oil and gas exploration, development, 
or production activity in the specified geographic region described in 
Sec. 18.122 that may cause the taking of polar bear or Pacific walrus 
in execution of those activities and you want nonlethal incidental take 
authorization under this rule, you must apply for a Letter of 
Authorization for each exploration activity or a Letter of Authorization 
for activities in each development or production area. You must submit 
the application for authorization to our Alaska Regional Director (see 
50 CFR 2.2 for address) at least 90 days prior to the start of the 
proposed activity.
    (c) Your application for a Letter of Authorization must include the 
following information:
    (1) A description of the activity, the dates and duration of the 
activity, the specific location, and the estimated area affected by that 
activity, i.e., a Plan of Operation.
    (2) A site-specific plan to monitor the effects of the activity on 
the behavior of polar bear and Pacific walrus that may be present during 
the ongoing activities. Your monitoring program must document the 
effects to these marine mammals and estimate the actual level and type 
of take. The monitoring requirements will vary depending on

[[Page 31]]

the activity, the location, and the time of year.
    (3) A site-specific polar bear awareness and interaction plan.
    (4) A Plan of Cooperation to mitigate potential conflicts between 
the proposed activity and subsistence hunting, where relevant. This Plan 
of Cooperation must identify measures to minimize adverse effects on the 
availability of polar bear and Pacific walrus for subsistence uses if 
the activity takes place in or near a traditional subsistence hunting 
area. Some of these measures may include, but are not limited to, 
mitigation measures described in Sec. 18.128.


<R05>
Sec. 18.125  What criteria does the Service use to evaluate Letter 

of Authorization requests?

    (a) We will evaluate each request for a Letter of Authorization 
based on the specific activity and the specific geographic location. We 
will determine whether the level of activity identified in the request 
exceeds that analyzed by us in making a finding of negligible impact on 
the species and a finding of no unmitigable adverse impact on the 
availability of the species for take for subsistence uses. If the level 
of activity is greater, we will reevaluate our findings to determine if 
those findings continue to be appropriate based on the greater level of 
activity that you have requested. Depending on the results of the 
evaluation, we may grant the authorization, add further conditions, or 
deny the authorization.
    (b) In accordance with Sec. 18.27(f)(5), we will make decisions 
concerning withdrawals of Letters of Authorization, either on an 
individual or class basis, only after notice and opportunity for public 
comment.
    (c) The requirement for notice and public comment in paragraph (b) 
of this section will not apply should we determine that an emergency 
exists that poses a significant risk to the well-being of the species or 
stock of polar bear or Pacific walrus.


<R05>
Sec. 18.126  What does a Letter of Authorization allow?

    (a) Your Letter of Authorization may allow the nonlethal incidental, 
but not intentional, take of polar bear and Pacific walrus when you are 
carrying out one or more of the following activities:
    (1) Conducting geological and geophysical surveys and associated 
activities;
    (2) Drilling exploratory wells and associated activities;
    (3) Developing oil fields and associated activities;
    (4) Drilling production wells and performing production support 
operations;
    (5) Conducting environmental monitoring activities associated with 
exploration, development, and production activities to determine 
specific impacts of each activity;
    (6) Conducting restoration, remediation, demobilization programs, 
and associated activities.
    (b) You must use methods and conduct activities identified in your 
Letter of Authorization in a manner that minimizes to the greatest 
extent practicable adverse impacts on polar bear and Pacific walrus, 
their habitat, and on the availability of these marine mammals for 
subsistence uses.
    (c) Each Letter of Authorization will identify conditions or methods 
that are specific to the activity and location.


<R05>
Sec. 18.127  What activities are prohibited?

    (a) Intentional take and lethal incidental take of polar bear or 
Pacific walrus; and
    (b) Any take that fails to comply with this part or with the terms 
and conditions of your Letter of Authorization.


<R05>
Sec. 18.128  What are the mitigation, monitoring, and reporting

requirements?

    (a) We require holders of Letters of Authorization to cooperate with 
us and other designated Federal, State, and local agencies to monitor 
the impacts of oil and gas exploration, development, and production 
activities on polar bear and Pacific walrus.
    (b) Holders of Letters of Authorization must designate a qualified 
individual or individuals to observe, record, and report on the effects 
of their activities on polar bear and Pacific walrus.

[[Page 32]]

    (c) All holders of Letters of Authorization are required to have an 
approved polar bear and/or walrus interaction plan on file with the 
Service and on-site, and polar bear awareness training will also be 
required of certain personnel. Interaction plans must include:
    (1) The type of activity and, where and when the activity will 
occur, i.e., a Plan of Operation;
    (2) A food and waste management plan;
    (3) Personnel training materials and procedures;
    (4) Site at-risk locations and situations;
    (5) Walrus/bear observation and reporting procedures; and
    (6) Bear/walrus avoidance and encounter procedures.
    (d) All applicants for a Letter of Authorization must contact 
affected subsistence communities to discuss potential conflicts caused 
by location, timing, and methods of proposed operations and submit to us 
a record of communication that documents these discussions. If 
appropriate, the applicant for a Letter of Authorization must also 
submit to us a Plan of Cooperation that ensures that activities will not 
interfere with subsistence hunting and that adverse effects on the 
availability of polar bear or Pacific walrus are minimized.
    (e) Mitigation measures that may be required on a case-by-case basis 
include:
    (1) The use of trained marine mammal monitors associated with marine 
activities. We may require a monitor on the site of the activity or on 
board drill ships, drill rigs, aircraft, icebreakers, or other support 
vessels or vehicles to monitor the impacts of Industry's activity on 
polar bear and Pacific walrus.
    (2) The use of den habitat map developed by the USGS. A map of 
potential coastal polar bear denning habitat can be found at: http://
www.absc.usgs.gov/research/sis--summaries/polar--bears--sis/mapping--
dens.htm. This measure ensures that the location of potential polar bear 
dens is considered when conducting activities in the coastal areas of 
the Beaufort Sea.
    (3) The use of Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) imagery, polar bear 
scent-trained dogs, or both to determine the presence or absence of 
polar bear dens in area of the activity.
    (4) Restricting the timing of the activity to limit disturbance 
around dens.
    (5) Requiring a 1-mile exclusion buffer surrounding known dens. If 
known occupied dens are located within an operator's area of activity, 
we will require a 1-mile exclusion buffer around the den to limit 
disturbance or require that the operator conduct activities after the 
female bears emerge from their dens. We will review these requirements 
for extenuating circumstances on a case-by-case basis.
    (f) For exploratory and development activities, holders of a Letter 
of Authorization must submit a report to our Alaska Regional Director 
(Attn: Marine Mammals Management Office) within 90 days after completion 
of activities. For production activities, holders of a Letter of 
Authorization must submit a report to our Alaska Regional Director 
(Attn: Marine Mammals Management Office) by January 15 for the preceding 
year's activities. Reports must include, at a minimum, the following 
information:
    (1) Dates and times of activity;
    (2) Dates and locations of polar bear or Pacific walrus activity as 
related to the monitoring activity; and
    (3) Results of the monitoring activities required under subsection 
(g) of this section, including an estimated level of take.
    (g) Monitoring requirements include, but are not limited to:
    (1) For all activities, all sightings of polar bears and walrus must 
be recorded. To the extent possible, the monitor will record group size, 
age, sex, reaction, duration of interaction, and closest approach to 
Industry activity.
    (2) Activities within the coast of the geographic region may 
incorporate daily polar bear watch logs.
    (3) Polar bear monitors will be required under the monitoring plan 
if polar bears are known to frequent the area or known polar bear dens 
are present in the area. Monitors will act as an early detection system 
in regards to proximate bear activity to Industry facilities.

[[Page 33]]

    (4) Offshore sites may require systematic monitoring protocols for 
polar bears and walrus due to their nearshore locations. Systematic 
monitoring may be implemented to statistically monitor observation 
trends of walrus or polar bears in the nearshore areas where they 
usually occur.


<R05>
Sec. 18.129  What are the information collection requirements?

    (a) The Office of Management and Budget has approved the collection 
of information contained in this subpart and assigned control number 
1018-0070. You must respond to this information collection request to 
obtain a benefit pursuant to section 101(a)(5) of the Marine Mammal 
Protection Act (MMPA). We will use the information to (1) evaluate the 
application and determine whether or not to issue specific Letters of 
Authorization and (2) monitor impacts of activities conducted under the 
Letters of Authorization.
    (b) You should direct comments regarding the burden estimate or any 
other aspect of this requirement to the Information Collection Clearance 
Officer, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Department of the Interior, 
Mail Stop 222 ARLSQ, 1849 C Street, NW., Washington, DC 20240.

Sec. 20.20  Migratory Bird Harvest Information Program.

    (a) Information collection requirements. The collections of 
information contained in Sec. 20.20 have been approved by the Office of 
Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. and assigned 
clearance number 1018-0015. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a 
person is not required to respond to a collection of information unless 
it displays a currently valid OMB control number. The information will 
be used to provide a sampling frame for the national Migratory Bird 
Harvest Survey. Response is required from licensed hunters to obtain the 
benefit of hunting migratory game birds. Public reporting burden for 
this information is estimated to average 2 minutes per response for 
3,300,000 respondents, including the time for reviewing instructions, 
searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data 
needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Thus 
the total annual reporting and record-keeping burden for this collection 
is estimated to be 112,000 hours. Send comments regarding this burden 
estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, 
including suggestions for reducing the burden, to the Service 
Information Collection Clearance Officer, ms-224 ARLSQ, Fish and 
Wildlife Service, Washington, DC 20240, or the Office of Management and 
Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project 1018-0015, Washington, DC 20503.
    (b) General provisions. Each person hunting migratory game birds in 
any State except Hawaii must have identified himself or herself as a 
migratory bird hunter and given his or her name, address, and date of 
birth to the respective State hunting licensing authority and must have 
on his or her person evidence, provided by that State, of compliance 
with this requirement.
    (c) Tribal exemptions. Nothing in paragraph (b) of this section 
shall apply to tribal members on Federal Indian Reservations or to 
tribal members hunting on ceded lands.
    (d) State exemptions. Nothing in paragraph (b) of this section shall 
apply to those hunters who are exempt from State-licensing requirements 
in the State in which they are hunting.
    (e) State responsibilities. The State hunting licensing authority 
will ask each licensed migratory bird hunter in the respective State to 
report approximately how many ducks, geese, doves, and woodcock he or 
she bagged the previous year, whether he or she hunted coots, snipe, 
rails, and/or gallinules the previous year, and, in States that have 
band-tailed pigeon hunting seasons, whether he or she intends to hunt 
band-tailed pigeons during the current year.

exceed three shells. However, this restriction does not apply during:
    (1) A light-goose-only season (greater and lesser snow geese and 
Ross' geese) when all other waterfowl and crane hunting seasons, 
excluding falconry, are closed while hunting light geese in Central and 
Mississippi Flyway portions of Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Illinois,

low floating device, having a depression affording the hunter a means of 
concealment beneath the surface of the water;
    (d) From or by means, aid, or use of any motor vehicle, motor-driven 
land conveyance, or aircraft of any kind, except that paraplegics and 
persons missing one or both legs may take from any stationary motor 
vehicle or stationary motor-driven land conveyance;
    (e) From or by means of any motorboat or other craft having a motor 
attached, or any sailboat, unless the motor has been completely shut off 
and/or the sails furled, and its progress therefrom has ceased: 
Provided, That a craft under power may be used to retrieve dead or 
crippled birds; however, crippled birds may not be shot from such craft 
under power except in the seaduck area as permitted in subpart K of this 
part;
    (f) By the use or aid of live birds as decoys; although not limited 
to, it shall be a violation of this paragraph for any person to take 
migratory waterfowl on an area where tame or captive live ducks or geese 
are present unless such birds are and have been for a period of 10 
consecutive days prior to such taking, confined within an enclosure 
which substantially reduces the audibility of their calls and totally 
conceals such birds from the sight of wild migratory waterfowl;
    (g) By the use or aid of recorded or electrically amplified bird 
calls or sounds, or recorded or electrically amplified imitations of 
bird calls or sounds. However, this restriction does not apply during:
    (1) A light-goose-only season (greater and lesser snow geese and

approved in the annual regulatory schedule in subpart K of this part.
    (h) By means or aid of any motordriven land, water, or air 
conveyance, or any sailboat used for the purpose of or resulting in the 
concentrating, driving, rallying, or stirring up of any migratory bird;
    (i) By the aid of baiting, or on or over any baited area, where a 
person knows or reasonably should know that the area is or has been 
baited. However, nothing in this paragraph prohibits:

    (ii) From a blind or other place of concealment camouflaged with 
natural vegetation;
    (iii) From a blind or other place of concealment camouflaged with 
vegetation from agricultural crops, as long as such camouflaging does 
not result in the exposing, depositing, distributing or scattering of 
grain or other feed; or
    (iv) Standing or flooded standing agricultural crops where grain is 
inadvertently scattered solely as a result of a hunter entering or 
exiting a hunting area, placing decoys, or retrieving downed birds.
    (2) The taking of any migratory game bird, except waterfowl, coots 
and cranes, on or over lands or areas that are not otherwise baited 
areas, and where grain or other feed has been distributed or scattered

     Subpart K_Annual Seasons, Limits, and Shooting Hours Schedules


<R05>
Sec. 20.100  General provisions.

    (a) The taking, possession, transportation, and other uses of 
migratory game birds by hunters is generally prohibited unless it is 
specifically provided for under regulations developed in accordance with 
the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Consequently, hunting is prohibited 
unless regulatory schedules are established for seasons, daily bag and 
possession limits, and shooting (or hawking) hours. Migratory game bird 
population levels, including production and habitat conditions, vary 
annually. These conditions differ over North America, and within the 
United States, by flyways, States, and frequently areas within States. 
Thus, it is necessary to make annual adjustments in the schedules to 
limit the harvests of migratory game birds to permissible levels.
    (b) The development of these schedules involves annual data 
gathering programs to determine migratory game bird population status 
and trends, evaluations of habitat conditions, harvest information, and 
other factors having a bearing on the anticipated size of the fall 
flights of these birds. The proposed hunting schedules are announced 
early in the spring, and following consideration of additional 
information as it becomes available, as well as public comment, they are 
modified and published as supplemental proposals. These are also open to 
public comment. Public hearings are held for the purpose of providing 
additional opportunity for public participation in the rulemaking 
process.

reopening the hunting season for such birds will not result in a 
diminution of the abundance of birds to any greater extent than that 
contemplated for the original hunting season, the hunting season for the 
birds so affected may, subject to all other provisions of this 
subchapter, be extended or reopened by the Secretary upon request of the

crows. Such State statutes or regulations may set forth the method of 
taking, the bag and possession limits, the dates and duration of the 
hunting season, and such other regulations as may be deemed appropriate, 
subject to the following limitations for each State:
    (1) Crows shall not be hunted from aircraft;
    (2) The hunting season or seasons on crows shall not exceed a total 
of 124 days during a calendar year;
    (3) Hunting shall not be permitted during the peak crow nesting 
period within a State; and
    (4) Crows may only be taken by firearms, bow and arrow, and 
falconry.

Sec. 20.134  Nontoxic shot.

    (a) Approval. (1) The information collection requirements contained 
in Sec. 20.134 have been approved by the Office of Management and 
Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. and assigned clearance number 1018-
0067. The information is being collected to provide a basis for which 
the Director, Fish and Wildlife Service, can conduct a methodical and 
objective review to approve/disapprove nontoxic shot status sought by an 
applicant. The information will be used for toxicity assessment of 
candidate shot submitted for approval by applicant. Response is required 
to obtain a benefit.
    (2) The Director, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, shall determine 
that a specific type of shot material is acceptable for the purposes of 
50 CFR 20.21(j), if after a review of applications and supporting data 
submitted in accordance with this section, together with all other 
relevant evidence, including public comment, it is concluded that the 
spent shot material does not impose a significant danger to migratory 
birds and other wildlife or their habitats.
    (b) Application and review--Tiered strategy for approval of nontoxic 
shot and shot coating. (1) All applications for approval under this 
section must be submitted with supporting documentation to the Director 
in accordance with the following procedures and must include at a 
minimum the supporting materials and information covered by Tier 1 in 
the tiered approval system as follows:
    (2) Tier 1. (i)(A) Applicant provides statements of use, chemical 
characterization, production variability, volume of use of candidate 
material and shot sample as listed in paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(A)(1) through 
(5), (b)(2)(i)(B)(1) through (5), and (b)(2)(i)(C)(1) through (3) of 
this section. The candidate shot or shot coating may be chemically 
analyzed by the Service or an independent laboratory to compare the 
results with the applicant's descriptions of shot composition and 
composition variability. Rejection of the application will occur if it 
is incomplete or if the composition of the candidate material, upon 
analysis, varies significantly from that described by the applicant.
    (1) Statement of proposed use, i.e., purpose and types.
    (2) Description of the chemical composition of the intact material.
    (i) Chemical names, Chemical Abstracts Service numbers (if 
available), and structures.
    (ii) Chemical characterization for organics and organometallics for 
coating and core [e.g., empirical formula, melting point, molecular 
weight, solubility, specific gravity, partition coefficients, hydrolysis 
half-life, leaching rate (in water and soil), degradation half-life, 
vapor pressure, stability and other relevant characteristics].
    (iii) Composition and weight of shot material.
    (iv) Thickness, quantity (e.g., mg/shot), and chemical composition 
of shot coating.
    (3) Statement of the expected variability of shot during production.
    (4) Estimate of yearly volume of candidate shot and/or coated shot 
expected for use in hunting migratory birds in the U.S.
    (5) Five pounds of the candidate shot and/or coated shot, as 
applicable, in size equivalent to United States standard size No. 4 
(0.13 inches in diameter).
    (B) Applicant provides information on the toxicological effects of 
the shot or shot coating as follows:
    (1) A summary of the acute and chronic mammalian toxicity data of 
the shot or shot coating ranking its toxicity (e.g., LD50<5 mg/kg = 
super toxic, 5-50 mg/kg = extremely toxic, 50-500 mg/kg = very toxic, 
500-5,000 mg/kg = moderately toxic, 5,000-15,000 = slightly toxic, 
<ls-thn-eq>15,000 mg/kg = practically nontoxic) with citations.
    (2) A summary of known acute, chronic, and reproductive 
toxicological data of the chemicals comprising the shot or shot coating 
with respect to birds, particularly waterfowl (include LD50 or LC50 
data, and sublethal effects) with citations.
    (3) A narrative description, with citations to relevant data, 
predicting the toxic effect in waterfowl of complete erosion and 
absorption of one shot or coated shot in a 24-hour period. Define the 
nature of toxic effect (e.g., mortality, impaired reproduction, 
substantial weight loss, disorientation and

[[Page 49]]

other relevant associated clinical observations).
    (4) A statement, with supporting rationale and citations to relevant 
data, that there is or is not any reasonable basis for concern for shot 
or coated shot ingestion by fish, amphibians, reptiles or mammals. If 
there is some recognized impact on fish, amphibians, reptiles, or 
mammals, the Service may require additional study.
    (5) Summarize the toxicity data of chemicals comprising the shot or 
shot coating to aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates, fish, amphibians, 
reptiles, and mammals.
    (C) Applicant provides information on the environmental fate and 
transport, if any, of the shot or shot coating as follows:
    (1) A statement of the alteration of the shot or shot coating, 
chemically or physically, upon firing. The statement must describe any 
alterations.
    (2) An estimate of the environmental half-life of the organic or 
organometallic component of the shot or shot coating, and a description 
of the chemical form of the breakdown products.
    (3) Information on the Estimated Environmental Concentration (EEC) 
assuming 69,000 shot per hectare (Bellrose 1959; Pain 1990) for:
    (i) A terrestrial ecosystem, assuming complete dissolution of 
material in 5 cm of soil. What would be the EEC and would that EEC 
exceed existing clean soil standards? (Environmental Protection Agency 
[EPA] standards for the Use of Disposal of Sewage Sludge; 40 CFR Part 
503). How does the estimated EEC relate to the toxicity threshold for 
plants, invertebrates, fish and wildlife?
    (ii) An aquatic ecosystem, assuming complete dissolution of the shot 
or shot coating in 1 cubic foot of water. What is the estimated EEC, and 
how does it compare to the EPA Water Quality Criteria and toxicity 
thresholds in plants, invertebrates, fish and wildlife?
    (D) Service evaluation of an application. (1) In reviewing the 
submission, the Service will use an exceedence of 1 LD50/square foot as 
the level of concern (U.S.E.P.A. 1992) as a criteria in the risk 
assessment.
    (2) In cooperation with the applicant, the Service will conduct a 
risk assessment using the Quotient Method (Environmental Protection 
Agency 1986): Risk = EEC/Toxicological Level of Concern Compare EEC in 
ppm to an effect level (e.g., LD50 in ppm. If Q < 0.1 = No Adverse 
Effects; If 0.1 <= Q <= 10.0 = Possible Adverse Effects; If Q 
<ls-thn-eq> 10.0 = Probable Adverse Effects.
    (3) Upon receipt of the Tier 1 application, the Director will review 
it to determine if the submission is complete. If complete, the 
applicant is notified within 30 days of receipt that a thorough review 
of the application will commence. A Notice of Application will appear in 
the Federal Register announcing the initiation of review of a Tier 1 
application. Complete review of a Tier 1 application will occur within 
60 days of the date the Notice of Application is published in the 
Federal Register.
    (E) If, after review of the Tier 1 data, the Service does not 
conclude that the shot or shot coating does not impose a significant 
danger to migratory birds, other wildlife, and their habitats, the 
applicant is advised to proceed with the additional testing described 
for Tier 2, Tier 3, or both. A Notice of Review will inform the public 
that Tier 1 test results are inconclusive, and Tier 2, Tier 3, or both 
testing are required before further consideration.
    (F) If review of the Tier 1 data results in a preliminary 
determination that the candidate material does not impose a significant 
danger to migratory birds, other wildlife, and their habitats, the 
Director will publish in the Federal Register a proposed rule stating 
the Service's intention to approve this shot or shot coating based on 
the toxicological report and toxicity studies. The rulemaking will 
include a description of the chemical composition of the candidate shot 
or shot coating, and a synopsis of findings under the standards required 
for Tier 1. If, at the end of the comment period, the Service finds no 
technical or scientific basis upon which to alter its conclusion, the 
candidate material will be approved by the publication of a final rule 
in the Federal Register. If, after receiving public comment, the Service

[[Page 50]]

determines that all available information does not establish that the 
shot and/or shot coating does not impose a significant danger to 
migratory birds, other wildlife, and their habitats, Tier 2, Tier 3, or 
both testing will be required and a Notice of Review will appear in the 
Federal Register. If only one of these two Tier tests are required, the 
Service will explain in the notice why the other is not required. If the 
applicant chooses not to proceed, the determination denying approval 
will appear in the Federal Register.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (3) Tier 2. (i) If Tier 2 testing is required, the applicant must 
submit a plan that addresses paragraph (b)(3)(ii) requirements. The 
Director will review the Tier 2 testing plan submitted by the applicant 
within 30 days of receipt. The Director may decline to approve the plan, 
or any part of it, if deficient in any manner with regard to timing, 
format or content. The Director shall apprise the applicant regarding 
what parts, if any, of the submitted testing procedures to disregard and 
any modifications to incorporate into the Tier 2 testing plan in order 
to gain plan approval. All testing procedures will be in compliance with 
the Good Laboratory Practices Standards (40 CFR part 160) except where 
they conflict with the regulations in this section or with a provision 
of an approved plan. The Director, or authorized representative, may 
elect to inspect the applicant's laboratory facilities and may decline 
to approve the plan and further consideration of the candidate shot if 
the facility does not meet the Good Laboratory Practices Standards. 
After the plan is accepted, Tier 2 testing will commence. Required 
analyses and reports, in accordance with the regulations in this 
section, must be sent to the Director. The applicant will ensure that 
copies of all the raw data and statistical analyses accompany the 
laboratory reports and final comprehensive report of this test.
    (ii) Evaluation of the candidate shot or shot coating will first be 
in a standardized test under in vitro conditions (see paragraph be in a 
standardized test under in vitro conditions (see paragraph 
(b)(3)(ii)(A)) that will assess its erosion and any release of 
components into a liquid medium in an environment simulating in vivo 
conditions of a waterfowl gizzard. Erosion characteristics are to be 
compared with those of lead shot and steel shot of comparable size. 
Following the erosion rate testing, the applicant must conduct a 30-day 
acute toxicity test in mallards, and a test to determine the candidate 
shot and/or shot coating effects on selected invertebrates and fish and 
include the results in the report for the Director.
    (A) In vitro erosion rate test. Conduct a standardized in vitro test 
to determine erosion rate of the candidate shot or shot coating using 
the guidelines in Kimball and Munir (1971), unless otherwise provided by 
the Service.
    (1) Typical test materials: Atomic absorption spectrophotometer; 
Drilled aluminum block to support test tubes; Thermostatically 
controlled stirring hot plate; Small Teflon <SUP>[reg]</SUP>-coated 
magnets; Hydrochloric acid (pH 2.0) and pepsin; Capped test tubes; and 
Lead, steel and candidate shot/coated shot.
    (2) Typical test procedures. Add hydrochloric acid and pepsin to 
each capped test tube at a volume and concentration that will erode a 
single No. 4 lead shot at a rate of 5 mg/day. Place three test tubes, 
each containing either lead shot, steel shot or candidate shot and/or 
coated shot, in an aluminum block on the stirring hot plate. Add a 
Teflon <SUP>[reg]</SUP> coated magnet to each test tube and set the hot 
plate at 42 degrees centigrade and 500 revolutions per minute. Determine 
the erosion of shot or coated shot daily for 14 consecutive days by 
weighing the shot and analyzing the digestion solution with an atomic 
absorption spectrophotometer. Replicate the 14-day procedure five times.
    (3) Typical test analyses. Compare erosion rates of the three types 
of shot by appropriate analysis of variance and regression procedures. 
The statistical analysis will determine whether the rate of erosion of 
the shot and/or shot coating is significantly greater or less than that 
of lead and steel. This determination is important to any subsequent 
toxicity testing.
    (B) Acute toxicity test--Tier 2 (Short-term, 30-day acute toxicity 
test using a commercially available duck food.). Over a 30-day period, 
conduct a short-term

[[Page 51]]

acute toxicity test that complies with the guidelines described as 
follows or as otherwise provided by the Service:
    (1) Typical test materials: 30 male and 30 female hand-reared 
mallards approximately 6 to 8 months old (mallards must have plumage and 
body conformation that resemble wild mallards); 60 elevated outdoor pens 
equipped with feeders and waterers; Laboratory equipped to perform 
fluoroscopy, required blood and tissue assays, and necropsies; 
Commercial duck maintenance mash; and Lead, steel and candidate shot.
    (2) Typical test procedures. House mallards individually in pens and 
give ad libitum access to food and water. After 3 weeks, randomly assign 
to 3 groups (10 males and 10 females/group), dose with eight pellets of 
either No. 4 lead shot (positive control), steel shot (negative 
control), or the candidate shot or coated shot. Fluoroscope birds at 1 
week after dosage to check for shot retention. Observe birds daily for 
signs of intoxication and mortality over a 30-day period. Determine body 
weight at the time of dosing, and at days 15 and 30 of the test. On days 
15 and 30, collect blood by venipuncture, determine hematocrit, 
hemoglobin concentration and other specified blood chemistries. 
Sacrifice all survivors on day 30. Remove the liver and other 
appropriate organs from the sacrificed birds and from birds that died 
prior to sacrifice on day 30 for histopathological analysis. Analyze the 
organs for lead and compounds contained in the candidate shot or coated 
shot. Necropsy all birds to determine any pathological conditions.
    (3) Typical test analyses. Analyze mortality among the specified 
groups with appropriate chi-square statistical procedures. Analyze 
physiological data and tissue contaminant data by analysis of variance 
or other appropriate statistical procedures to include the factors of 
shot type and sex. Compare sacrificed birds and birds that died prior to 
sacrifice whenever sample sizes are adequate for meaningful comparison.
    (C) Daphnid and fish early-life toxicity tests. Determine the 
toxicity of the compounds that comprise the shot or shot coating (at 
conditions maximizing solubility without adversely affecting controls) 
to selected invertebrates and fish. These methods are subject to the 
environmental effects test regulations developed under the authority of 
the Toxic Substances Control Act (15 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.), as follows:
    (1) The first test, the Daphnid Acute Toxicity Test (conducted in 
accordance with 40 CFR 797.1300), is a guideline for use in developing 
data on the acute toxicity of chemical substances. This guideline 
prescribes an acute toxicity test in which Daphnid exposure to a 
chemical in static and flow-through systems, with the agencies assessing 
the hazard the compound(s) may present to an aquatic environment.
    (2) The second test is the Daphnid Chronic Toxicity Test (conducted 
in accordance with 40 CFR 797.1330). This gathers data on the chronic 
toxicity of chemical substances in which Daphnids (Daphnia spp.) are 
exposed to a chemical in a renewal or flow-through system. The data from 
this test are again used to assess the hazard that the compound(s) may 
present to an aquatic environment.
    (3) A third test, Fish Early Life Stage Toxicity Test (conducted in 
accordance with 40 CFR Section 797.1600), assesses the adverse effects 
of chemical substances to fish in the early stages of their growth and 
development. Data from this test are used to determine the hazard the 
compound(s) may present to an aquatic environment.
    (iii) After the Tier 2 testing, the applicant will report the 
results to the Director. If, after review of the Tier 2 data, the 
Service determines that the information does not establish that the shot 
or shot coating does not impose a significant danger to migratory birds, 
other wildlife, and their habitats, the applicant is advised to proceed 
with the additional testing in Tier 3. A Notice of Review advises the 
public that, in conjunction with Tier 1 data, Tier 2 test results are 
inconclusive and Tier 3 testing is required for continued consideration.
    (iv) If review of the Tier 2 test data results in a preliminary 
determination that the candidate shot or shot coating does not impose a 
significant danger to migratory birds, other wildlife, and

[[Page 52]]

their habitats, the Director will publish in the Federal Register a 
proposed rule stating the Service's intention to approve this shot and/
or coating and why Tier 3 testing is unnecessary. The rulemaking will 
include a description of chemical composition of the shot or shot 
coating, and a synopsis of findings under the standards required at Tier 
2. If, at the end of the comment period, the Service finds no technical 
or scientific basis upon which to deny approval, the candidate shot or 
shot coating approval is published as a final rule in the Federal 
Register. If, as a result of the comment period, the Service determines 
that the information does not establish that the shot and/or shot 
coating does not impose a significant danger to migratory birds, other 
wildlife, and their habitats, Tier 3 testing will be required and a 
Notice of Review published in the Federal Register. If the applicant 
chooses not to proceed, the determination denying approval of the 
candidate shot or shot coating will appear in the Federal Register.
    (4) Tier 3. (i) If the Director determines that the Tier 1 or Tier 2 
information is inconclusive, the Director will notify the applicant to 
submit a Tier 3 testing plan for conducting further testing as outlined 
in paragraphs (b)(4)(i) (A) and (B) of this section. Review, by the 
Director, of the Tier 3 testing plan submitted by the applicant will 
occur within 30 days of receipt. The Director may decline to approve the 
plan, or any part of it, if deficient in any manner with regard to 
timing, format or content. The Director shall apprise the applicant 
regarding what parts, if any, of the submitted testing procedure to 
disregard and any modifications to incorporate into the Tier 3 plan in 
order to gain plan approval. All testing procedures should be in 
compliance with the Good Laboratory Practices Standards (40 CFR part 
160), except where they conflict with the regulations in this section or 
with a provision of an approved plan. The Director, or authorized 
representative, may elect to inspect the applicant's laboratory 
facilities and may decline to approve the plan and further consideration 
of the candidate shot and/or shot coating if the facility is not in 
compliance with the Good Laboratory Practices Standards. After 
acceptance of the plan, Tier 3 testing will commence. Required analyses 
and reports must be sent to the Director. The applicant will ensure that 
copies of all the raw data and statistical analyses accompany the 
laboratory reports and final comprehensive report of this test.
    (A) Chronic toxicity test--Tier 3 (Long-term toxicity test under 
depressed temperature conditions using a nutritionally-deficient diet). 
Conduct a chronic exposure test under adverse conditions that complies 
with the general guidelines described as follows unless otherwise 
provided by the Service:
    (1) Typical test materials: 36 male and 36 female hand-reared 
mallards approximately 6 to 8 months old (Mallards must have plumage and 
body conformation that resembles wild mallards); 72 elevated outdoor 
pens equipped with feeders and waterers; Laboratory equipped to perform 
fluoroscopy, required blood and tissue assays, and necropsies; Whole 
kernel corn; and Lead, steel, and candidate shot or coated shot.
    (2) Typical test procedures. (i) Conduct this test at a location 
where the mean monthly low temperature during December through March is 
between 20 and 40 degrees Fahrenheit (-6.6 and 4.4 degrees centigrade, 
respectively). Assign individual mallards to elevated outdoor pens 
during the first week of December and acclimate to an ad libitum diet of 
whole kernel corn for 2 weeks. Randomly assign birds to 5 groups (lead 
group of 4 males and 4 females, 4 other groups of 8 males and 8 females/
group). Dose the lead group (positive control) with one size No. 4 
pellet of lead shot. Dose one group (8 males and 8 females) with eight 
size No. 4 pellets of steel shot (negative control) and dose the 3 other 
groups (8 males and 8 females/group) with one, four and eight size No. 4 
pellets of candidate shot or coated shot.
    (ii) Weigh and fluoroscope birds weekly. Weigh all recovered shot to 
measure erosion. Determine blood parameters given in the 30-day acute 
toxicity test. Provide body weight and blood parameter measurements on 
samples drawn at 24 hours after dosage and at the end of days 30 and 60. 
At the

[[Page 53]]

end of 60 days, sacrifice all survivors. Remove the liver and other 
appropriate organs from sacrificed birds and birds dying prior to 
sacrifice on day 60 for histopathological analysis. Analyze organs for 
lead and other metals potentially contained in the candidate shot or 
shot coating. Necropsy all birds that died prior to sacrifice to 
determine pathological conditions associated with death.
    (3) Typical test analyses. Analyze mortality among the specified 
groups with appropriate chi-square statistical procedures. Any effects 
on the previously mentioned physiological parameters caused by the shot 
or shot coating must be significantly less than those caused by lead 
shot and must not be significantly greater than those caused by steel 
shot. Analyze physiological data and tissue contaminant data by analysis 
of variance or appropriate statistical procedures to include the factors 
of shot type, dose and sex. Compare sacrificed birds and birds that died 
prior to sacrifice whenever sample sizes are adequate for a meaningful 
comparison.
    (B) Chronic dosage study--Tier 3 (Moderately long-term study that 
includes reproductive assessment). Conduct chronic exposure reproduction 
trial with the general guidelines described as follows unless otherwise 
provided by the Service:
    (1) Typical test materials: 44 male and 44 female hand-reared first 
year mallards (Mallards must have plumage and body conformation that 
resemble wild mallards); Pens suitable for quarantine and acclimation 
and for reasonably holding 5-10 ducks each; 44 elevated, pens equipped 
with feeders, waterers and nest boxes; Laboratory equipped to perform 
fluoroscopy, required blood and tissue assays, and necropsies; Whole 
kernel corn, and commercial duck maintenance and breeder mash; and Lead, 
steel and candidate shot or coated shot.
    (2) Typical test procedures. (i) Randomly assign mallards to 3 
groups (Lead group = 4 males and 4 females; steel group = 20 males and 
20 females; candidate shot/coated shot group = 20 males and 20 females) 
in December and hold in same-sex groups until mid-January (dates apply 
to outdoor test facility only and will reflect where in the U.S. tests 
are conducted). Tests conducted in the southern U.S. will need to be 
completed in low temperature units. After a 3-week acclimation period 
with ducks receiving commercial maintenance mash, provide birds with an 
ad libitum diet of corn for 60 days and then pair birds (one pair/pen) 
and provide commercial breeder mash. Dosing of the 3 groups with one 
pellet of No. 4 lead shot (positive control); eight pellets of No. 4 
steel shot (negative control); and eight pellets of No. 4 candidate shot 
or coated shot will occur after the acclimation period (day 0) and 
redosed after 30, 60, and 90 days. Few, if any, of the lead-dosed birds 
(positive control) should survive and reproduce.
    (ii) Fluoroscope birds 1 week after dosage to check for shot 
retention. Weigh males and females the day of initial dosing (day 0), at 
each subsequent dosing, and at death. Measure blood parameters 
identified in the 30-Day Acute Toxicity Test in this test using samples 
drawn at time of weighing. Note the date of first egg and the mean 
number of days per egg laid. Conclude laying after 21 normal, uncracked 
eggs are laid or after 150 days. Sacrifice adults after completion of 
laying period. Remove the liver and other appropriate organs from 
sacrificed birds and from other birds that died prior to sacrifice for 
histopathological analysis. Analyze organs and the 11th egg for 
compounds contained in the shot or shot coating. Necropsy all birds to 
determine any pathological conditions. Check nests daily to collect 
eggs. Discard any eggs laid before pairing. Artificially incubate eggs 
and calculate the percent shell thickness, percent eggs cracked, percent 
fertility (as determined by candling), and percent hatch of fertile eggs 
for each female. Provide ducklings with starter mash after hatching. 
Sacrifice all ducklings at 14 days of age. Measure survival to day 14 
and weight of the ducklings at hatching and sacrifice. Measure blood 
parameters identified in the 30-Day Acute Toxicity Test using samples 
drawn at sacrificing.
    (3) Typical test analyses. (i) Any mortality, reproductive 
inhibition or effects on the physiological parameters

[[Page 54]]

in paragraph (b)(4) by the shot or shot coating must not be 
significantly greater than those caused by steel shot. Percentage data 
is subject to an arcsine, square root transformation prior to 
statistical analyses. Physiological and reproductive data is analyzed by 
one-tailed t-tests ([alpha]=0.05), or other appropriate statistical 
procedures by the applicant.
    (ii) After conclusion of Tier 3 testing, the applicant must report 
the results to the Director. If after review of the Tier 3 data 
(completion 60 days after receipt of material) the Service determines 
that all of the information gathered and submitted in accordance with 
Tiers 1, 2, and 3, as applicable, does not establish that the shot or 
shot coating does not impose a significant danger to migratory birds, 
other wildlife, and their habitats, the applicant will have the option 
of repeating the tests that the Director deems are inconclusive. If the 
applicant chooses not to repeat the tests, approval of the candidate 
shot or shot coating is denied. A Notice of Review will inform the 
public that Tier 3 results are inconclusive, the applicant's decision 
not to repeat Tier 3 testing, and the Service's subsequent denial of the 
shot or shot coating.
    (iii) If review of either the initial or repeated Tier 3 test data 
results in a preliminary determination that the shot or shot coating 
does not impose a significant danger to migratory birds, other wildlife 
and their habitats, the Director will publish in the Federal Register a 
proposed rule stating the Service's intention to approve this shot or 
shot coating and providing the public with the opportunity to comment. 
The rulemaking will include a description of the chemical composition of 
the shot or shot coating and a synopsis of findings under the standards 
required by Tier 3. If at the end of the comment period, the Service 
concludes that the shot or shot coating does not impose a significant 
danger to migratory birds, other wildlife, or their habitats, the shot 
or shot coating will be approved as nontoxic with publication of a final 
rule in the Federal Register.
    (5) Residual lead levels. The Service's maximum environmentally 
acceptable level of lead in shot is trace amounts or <1 percent. Any 
shot manufactured with lead levels equal to or exceeding 1 percent are 
considered toxic and, therefore, illegal.
    (6) Field detection device. Before approval of any shot for use in 
migratory game bird hunting, a noninvasive field testing device must be 
available for enforcement officers to determine the shot material in a 
given shell in the field.

                         Subpart A_Introduction


<R05>
Sec. 21.1  Purpose of regulations.

    The regulations contained in this part supplement the general permit 
regulations of part 13 of this subchapter with respect to permits for 
the taking, possession, transporation, sale, purchase, barter, 
importation, exportation, and banding or marking of migratory birds. 
This part also provides certain exceptions to permit requirements for 
public, scientific, or educational institutions, and establishes 
depredation orders which provide limited exceptions to the Migratory 
Bird Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. 703-712).

[54 FR 38150, Sept. 14, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 21.2  Scope of regulations.

    (a) Migratory birds, their parts, nests, or eggs, lawfully acquired 
prior to the effective date of Federal protection under the Migratory 
Bird Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. 703-712) may be possessed or transported 
without a permit, but may not be imported, exported, purchased, sold, 
bartered, or offered for purchase, sale or barter, and all shipments of 
such birds must be marked as provided by part 14 of this subchapter: 
Provide, no exemption from any statute or regulation shall accrue to any 
offspring of such migratory birds.
    (b) This part, except for Sec. 21.12(a), (c), and (d) (general 
permit exceptions); Sec. 21.22 (banding or marking); Sec. 21.29 
(Federal falconry standards); and Sec. 21.31 (rehabilitation), does not 
apply to the bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) or the golden eagle 
(Aquila chrysaetos), for which regulations are provided in part 22 of 
this subchapter.
    (c) The provisions of this part are in addition to, and are not in 
lieu of other regulations of this subchapter B which may require a 
permit or prescribe additional restrictions or conditions for the 
importation, exportation, and interstate transportation of wildlife (see 
also part 13).

[39 FR 1178, Jan. 4, 1974, as amended at 46 FR 42680, Aug. 24, 1981; 68 
FR 61137, Oct. 27, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 21.3  Definitions.

    In addition to definitions contained in part 10 of this chapter, and 
unless the context requires otherwise, as used in this part:
    Armed Forces means the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast 
Guard, and the National Guard of any State.
    Bred in captivity or captive-bred refers to raptors, including eggs, 
hatched in captivity from parents that mated or otherwise transferred 
gametes in captivity.
    Captivity means that a live raptor is held in a controlled 
environment that is intensively manipulated by man for the purpose of 
producing raptors of selected species, and that has boundaries designed 
to prevent raptors, eggs or gametes of the selected species from 
entering or leaving the controlled environment. General characteristics 
of captivity may include, but are not limited to, artificial housing, 
waste removal, health care, protection from predators, and artificially 
supplied food.
    Conservation measures, as used in Sec. 21.15, means project design 
or mitigation activities that are reasonable from a scientific, 
technological, and economic standpoint, and are necessary to avoid, 
minimize, or mitigate the take of migratory birds or other adverse 
impacts. Conservation measures should be implemented in a reasonable 
period of time.
    Falconry means the sport of taking quarry by means of a trained 
raptor.
    Military readiness activity, as defined in Pub. L. 107-314, Sec. 
315(f), 116 Stat. 2458

[[Page 57]]

(Dec. 2, 2002) [Pub. L. Sec. 319 (c)(1)], includes all training and 
operations of the Armed Forces that relate to combat, and the adequate 
and realistic testing of military equipment, vehicles, weapons, and 
sensors for proper operation and suitability for combat use. It does not 
include (a) routine operation of installation operating support 
functions, such as: administrative offices; military exchanges; 
commissaries; water treatment facilities; storage facilities; schools; 
housing; motor pools; laundries; morale, welfare, and recreation 
activities; shops; and mess halls, (b) operation of industrial 
activities, or (c) construction or demolition of facilities listed 
above.
    Population, as used in Sec. 21.15, means a group of distinct, 
coexisting, conspecific individuals, whose breeding site fidelity, 
migration routes, and wintering areas are temporally and spatially 
stable, sufficiently distinct geographically (at some time of the year), 
and adequately described so that the population can be effectively 
monitored to discern changes in its status.
    Raptor means a live migratory bird of the Order Falconiformes or the 
Order Strigiformes, other than a bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) 
or a golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos).
    Resident Canada geese means Canada geese that nest within the lower 
48 States and the District of Columbia in the months of March, April, 
May, or June, or reside within the lower 48 States and the District of 
Columbia in the months of April, May, June, July, or August.
    Secretary of Defense means the Secretary of Defense or any other 
national defense official who has been nominated by the President and 
confirmed by the Senate.
    Service or we means the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Department 
of the Interior.
    Significant adverse effect on a population, as used in Sec. 21.15, 
means an effect that could, within a reasonable period of time, diminish 
the capacity of a population of migratory bird species to sustain itself 
at a biologically viable level. A population is ``biologically viable'' 
when its ability to maintain its genetic diversity, to reproduce, and to 
function effectively in its native ecosystem is not significantly 
harmed. This effect may be characterized by increased risk to the 
population from actions that cause direct mortality or a reduction in 
fecundity. Assessment of impacts should take into account yearly 
variations and migratory movements of the impacted species. Due to the 
significant variability in potential military readiness activities and 
the species that may be impacted, determinations of significant 
measurable decline will be made on a case-by-case basis.

Sec. 21.4  Information collection requirements.

    (a) The Office of Management and Budget approved the information 
collection requirements contained in this part 21 under 44 U.S.C. 3507 
and assigned OMB Control Number 1018-0022. The Service may not conduct 
or sponsor, and you are not required to respond to, a collection of 
information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. We 
are collecting this information to provide information necessary to 
evaluate permit applications. We will use this information to review 
permit applications and make decisions, according to criteria 
established in the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, 16 U.S.C. 703-712 and its 
regulations, on the issuance, suspension, revocation, or denial of 
permits. You must respond to obtain or retain a permit.
    (b) We estimate the public reporting burden for these reporting 
requirements to vary from 15 minutes to 4 hours per response, with an 
average of 0.803 hours per response, including time for reviewing 
instructions, gathering and maintaining data, and completing and 
reviewing the forms. Direct comments regarding the burden estimate or 
any other aspect of these reporting requirements to the Service 
Information Collection Control Officer, MS-222 ARLSQ, U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service, Washington, DC 20240, or the Office of Management and 
Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project (1018-0022), Washington, DC 20603.

    No person may take, possess, import, export, transport, sell, 
purchase, barter, or offer for sale, purchase, or barter, any migratory 
bird, or the parts, nests, or eggs of such bird except as may be 
permitted under the terms of a valid permit issued pursuant to the 
provisions of this part and part 13 of this chapter, or as permitted by 
regulations in this part, or part 20 of this subchapter (the hunting 
regulations), or part 92 of subchapter G of this chapter (the Alaska 
subsistence harvest regulations). Birds taken or possessed under this 
part in ``included areas'' of Alaska as defined in Sec. 92.5(a) are 
subject to this part and not to part 92 of subchapter G of this chapter.

[68 FR 43027, July 21, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 21.12  General exceptions to permit requirements.

    The following exceptions to the permit requirement are allowed.
    (a) Employees of the Department of the Interior authorized to 
enforce the provisions of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of July 3, 1918, 
as amended (40 Stat. 755; 16 U.S.C. 703-711), may, without a permit, 
take or otherwise acquire, hold in custody, transport, and dispose of 
migratory birds or their parts, nests, or eggs as necessary in 
performing their official duties.
    (b) State game departments, municipal game farms or parks, and 
public museums, public zoological parks, accredited institutional 
members of the American Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums 
(AAZPA) and public scientific or educational institutions may acquire by 
gift or purchase, possess, transport, and by gift or sale dispose of 
lawfully acquired migratory birds or their progeny, parts, nests, or 
eggs without a permit: Provided, That such birds may be acquired only 
from persons authorized by this paragraph or by a permit issued pursuant 
to this part to possess and dispose of such birds, or from Federal or 
State game authorities by the gift of seized, condemned, r sick or 
injured birds. Any such birds, acquired without a permit, and any 
progeny therefrom may be disposed of only to persons authorized by this 
paragraph to acquire such birds without a permit. Any person exercising 
a privilege granted by this paragraph must keep accurate records of such 
operations showing the species and number of birds acquired, possessed, 
and disposed of; the names and addresses of the persons from whom such 
birds were acquired or to whom such birds were donated or sold; and the 
dates of such transactions. Records shall be maintained or reproducible 
in English on a calendar year basis and shall be retained for a period 
of five (5) years following the end of the calendar year covered by the 
records.
    (c) Employees of Federal, State, and local wildlife and land 
management agencies; employees of Federal, State, and local public 
health agencies; and laboratories under contract to such agencies may in 
the course of official business collect, possess, transport, and dispose 
of sick or dead migratory birds or their parts for analysis to confirm 
the presence of infectious disease. Nothing in this paragraph authorizes 
the take of uninjured or healthy birds without prior authorization from 
the Service. Additionally, nothing in this paragraph authorizes the 
taking, collection, or possession of migratory birds when circumstances 
indicate reasonable probability that death, injury, or disability was 
caused by factors other than infectious disease and/or natural toxins. 
These factors may include, but are not limited to, oil or chemical 
contamination, electrocution, shooting, or pesticides. If the cause of 
death of a bird is determined to be other than natural causes or 
disease, Service law enforcement officials must be contacted without 
delay.
    (d) Licensed veterinarians are not required to obtain a Federal 
migratory bird permit to temporarily possess, stabilize, or euthanize 
sick and injured migratory birds. However, a veterinarian without a 
migratory bird rehabilitation permit must transfer any such bird to a 
federally permitted migratory bird rehabilitator within 24 hours after 
the bird's condition is stabilized, unless the bird is euthanized. If a 
veterinarian is unable to locate a permitted rehabilitator within that 
time,

[[Page 59]]

the veterinarian must contact his or her Regional Migratory Bird Permit 
Office for assistance in locating a permitted migratory bird 
rehabilitator and/or to obtain authorization to continue to hold the 
bird. In addition, veterinarians must:
    (1) Notify the local U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Ecological 
Services Office immediately upon receiving a threatened or endangered 
migratory bird species. Contact information for Ecological Services 
offices can be located on the Internet at http://offices.fws.gov;
    (2) Euthanize migratory birds as required by Sec. 21.31(e)(4)(iii) 
and Sec. 21.31(e)(4)(iv), and dispose of dead migratory birds in 
accordance with Sec. 21.31(e)(4)(vi); and
    (3) Keep records for 5 years of all migratory birds that die while 
in their care, including those they euthanize. The records must include: 
the species of bird, the type of injury, the date of acquisition, the 
date of death, and whether the bird was euthanized.

    (d) When so marked, such live birds may be killed, in any number, at 
any time or place, by any means except shooting. Such birds may be 
killed by shooting only in accordance with all applicable hunting 
regulations governing the taking of mallard ducks from the wild: 
Provided, That such birds may be killed by shooting, in any number, at 
any time, within the confines of any premises operated as a shooting 
preserve under State license, permit, or authorization; or they may be 
shot, in any number, at any time or place, by any person for bona fide 
dog training or field trial purposes: Provided further, That the 
provisions:
    (1) The hunting regulations (part 20 of this subchapter), with the 
exception of Sec. 20.108 (Nontoxic shot zones), and
    (2) The Migratory Bird Hunting Stamp Act (duck stamp requirement) 
shall not apply to shooting preserve operations as provided for in this 
paragraph, or to bona fide dog training or field trial operations.
    (e) At all times during possession, transportation, and storage 
until the raw carcasses of such birds are finally processed immediately 
prior to cooking, smoking, or canning, the marked foot or wing must 
remain attached to each carcass: Provided, That persons, who operate 
game farms or shooting preserves under a State license, permit, or 
authorization for such activities, may remove the marked foot or wing 
when either the number of his State license, permit, or authorization 
has first been legibly stamped in ink on the back of each carcass and on 
the container in which each carcass is maintained, or each carcass is 
identified by

[[Page 60]]

a State band on leg or wing pursuant to requirements of his State 
license, permit, or authorization. When properly marked, such carcasses 
may be disposed of to, or acquired from, any person and possessed and 
transported in any number at any time or place.

<R05>
Sec. 21.15  Authorization of take incidental to military readiness 

activities.

    (a) Take authorization and monitoring. (1) Except to the extent 
authorization is withdrawn or suspended pursuant to paragraph (b) of 
this section, the Armed Forces may take migratory birds incidental to 
military readiness activities provided that, for those ongoing or 
proposed activities that the Armed Forces determine may result in a 
significant adverse effect on a population of a migratory bird species, 
the Armed Forces must confer and cooperate with the Service to develop 
and implement appropriate conservation measures to minimize or mitigate 
such significant adverse effects.
    (2) When conservation measures implemented under paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section require monitoring, the Armed Forces must retain records of 
any monitoring data for five years from the date the Armed Forces 
commence their action. During Integrated Natural Resource Management 
Plan reviews, the Armed Forces will also report to the Service migratory 
bird conservation measures implemented and the effectiveness of the 
conservation measures in avoiding, minimizing, or mitigating take of 
migratory birds.

[[Page 61]]

    (b) Suspension or Withdrawal of take authorization. (1) If the 
Secretary determines, after seeking the views of the Secretary of 
Defense and consulting with the Secretary of State, that incidental take 
of migratory birds during a specific military readiness activity likely 
would not be compatible with one or more of the migratory bird treaties, 
the Secretary will suspend authorization of the take associated with 
that activity.
    (2) The Secretary may propose to withdraw, and may withdraw in 
accordance with the procedures provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this 
section the authorization for any take incidental to a specific military 
readiness activity if the Secretary determines that a proposed military 
readiness activity is likely to result in a significant adverse effect 
on the population of a migratory bird species and one or more of the 
following circumstances exists:
    (i) The Armed Forces have not implemented conservation measures 
that:
    (A) Are directly related to protecting the migratory bird species 
affected by the proposed military readiness activity;
    (B) Would significantly reduce take of the migratory bird species 
affected by the military readiness activity;
    (C) Are economically feasible; and
    (D) Do not limit the effectiveness of the military readiness 
activity;
    (ii) The Armed Forces fail to conduct mutually agreed upon 
monitoring to determine the effects of a military readiness activity on 
migratory bird species and/or the efficacy of the conservation measures 
implemented by the Armed Forces; or
    (iii) The Armed Forces have not provided reasonably available 
information that the Secretary has determined is necessary to evaluate 
whether withdrawal of take authorization for the specific military 
readiness activity is appropriate.
    (3) When the Secretary proposes to withdraw authorization with 
respect to a specific military readiness activity, the Secretary will 
first provide written notice to the Secretary of Defense. Any such 
notice will include the basis for the Secretary's determination that 
withdrawal is warranted in accordance with the criteria contained in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and will identify any conservation 
measures or other measures that would, if implemented by the Armed 
Forces, permit the Secretary to cancel the proposed withdrawal of 
authorization.
    (4) Within 15 days of receipt of the notice specified in paragraph 
(b)(3) of this section, the Secretary of Defense may notify the 
Secretary in writing of the Armed Forces' objections, if any, to the 
proposed withdrawal, specifying the reasons therefore. The Secretary 
will give due consideration to any objections raised by the Armed 
Forces. If the Secretary continues to believe that withdrawal is 
appropriate, he or she will provide written notice to the Secretary of 
Defense of the rationale for withdrawal and response to any objections 
to the withdrawal. If objections to the withdrawal remain, the 
withdrawal will not become effective until the Secretary of Defense has 
had the opportunity to meet with the Secretary within 30 days of the 
original notice from the Secretary proposing withdrawal. A final 
determination regarding whether authorization will be withdrawn will 
occur within 45 days of the original notice.
    (5) Any authorized take incidental to a military readiness activity 
subject to a proposed withdrawal of authorization will continue to be 
authorized by this regulation until the Secretary makes a final 
determination on the withdrawal.
    (6) The Secretary may, at his or her discretion, cancel a suspension 
or withdrawal of authorization at any time. A suspension may be 
cancelled in the event new information is provided that the proposed 
activity would be compatible with the migratory bird treaties. A 
proposed withdrawal may be cancelled if the Armed Forces modify the

Sec. 21.26  Special Canada goose permit.

    (a) What is the special Canada goose permit and what is its purpose? 
The special Canada goose permit is a permit issued by us to a State 
wildlife agency authorizing certain resident Canada goose management and 
control activities that are normally prohibited. We will only issue such 
a permit when it will contribute to human health and safety, protect 
personal property, or allow resolution or prevention of injury to people 
or property. The management and control activities conducted under the 
permit are intended to relieve or prevent injurious situations only. No 
person should construe the permit as opening, reopening, or extending 
any hunting season contrary to any regulations established under Section 
3 of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.
    (b) Who may receive a permit? Only State wildlife agencies (State) 
are eligible to receive a permit to undertake the various goose 
management and control activities. Additionally, only employees or 
designated agents of a permitted State wildlife agency may undertake 
activities for injurious resident Canada geese in accordance with the 
conditions specified in the permit, conditions contained in 50 CFR part 
13, and conditions specified in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (c) How does a State apply for a permit? Any State wildlife agency 
wishing to obtain a permit must submit an application to the appropriate 
Regional Director (see Sec. 13.11(b) of this subchapter) containing the 
general information and certification required by Sec. 13.12(a) of this 
subchapter plus the following information:
    (1) A detailed statement showing that the goose management and 
control activities will either provide for human health and safety, 
protect personal property, or allow resolution of other injury to people 
or property;
    (2) An estimate of the size of the resident Canada goose breeding 
population in the State;
    (3) The requested annual take of resident Canada geese, including 
eggs and nests;
    (4) A statement indicating that the State will inform and brief all 
employees and designated agents of the requirements of these regulations 
and permit conditions.
    (d) What are the conditions of the permit? The special Canada goose 
permits are subject to the general conditions in 50 CFR part 13, the 
conditions elsewhere in this section, and, unless otherwise specifically 
authorized on the permit, the conditions outlined below:
    (1) What are the limitations on management and control activities? 
(i) Take of resident Canada geese as a management tool under this 
section may not exceed the number authorized by the permit. States 
should utilize non-lethal goose management tools to the extent they deem 
appropriate in an effort to minimize lethal take.
    (ii) Methods of take for the control of injurious resident Canada 
geese are at the State's discretion. Methods include, but are not 
limited to, firearms, alpha-chloralose, traps, egg and nest manipulation 
and other damage control techniques consistent with accepted wildlife 
damage-management programs.
    (2) When may a State conduct management and control activities? 
States and their employees and agents may conduct management and control 
activities, including the take of resident

[[Page 67]]

Canada geese, under this section between March 11 and August 31. In 
California, Oregon and Washington, in areas where the threatened 
Aleutian Canada goose (B. c. leucoperia) has been present during the 
previous 10 years, lethal control activities are restricted to May 1 
through August 31, inclusive.
    (3) How must the States dispose or utilize geese taken under this 
permit? States and their employees and agents may possess, transport, 
and otherwise dispose of Canada geese taken under this section. States 
must utilize such birds by donation to public museums or public 
institutions for scientific or educational purposes, by processing them 
for human consumption and distributing them free of charge to charitable 
organizations, or by burying or incinerating them. States, their 
employees, and designated agents may not sell, offer for sale, barter, 
or ship for the purpose of sale or barter any Canada geese taken under 
this section, nor their plumage or eggs.
    (4) How does the permit relate to existing State law? No person 
conducting management and control activities under this section should 
construe the permit to authorize the killing of injurious resident 
Canada geese contrary to any State law or regulation, nor on any Federal 
land without specific authorization by the responsible management 
agency. No person may exercise the privileges granted under this section 
unless they possess any permits required for such activities by any 
State or Federal land manager.
    (5) When conducting management and control activities, are there any 
special inspection requirements? Any State employee or designated agent 
authorized to carry out management and control activities must have a 
copy of the permit and designation in their possession when carrying out 
any activities. The State must also require the property owner or 
occupant on whose premises the State is conducting activities to allow, 
at all reasonable times, including during actual operations, free and 
unrestricted access to any Service special agent or refuge officer, 
State wildlife or deputy wildlife agent, warden, protector, or other 
wildlife law enforcement officer (wildlife officer) on the premises 
where they are, or were, conducting activities. Furthermore, any State 
employee or designated agent conducting such activities must promptly 
furnish whatever information is required concerning such activities to 
any such wildlife officer.
    (6) What are the reporting requirements of the permit? Any State 
employee or designated agent exercising the privileges granted by this 
section must keep records of all activities carried out under the 
authority of this permit, including the number of Canada geese killed 
and their disposition. The State must submit an annual report detailing 
activities, including the time, numbers and location of birds, eggs, and 
nests taken and non-lethal techniques utilized, before December 31 of 
each year. The State should submit the annual report to the appropriate 
Assistant Regional Director--Refuges and Wildlife (see Sec. 10.22 of 
this subchapter).
    (7) What are the limitations of the special permit? The following 
limitations apply:
    (i) Nothing in this section applies to any Federal land within a 
State's boundaries without written permission of the Federal Agency with 
jurisdiction.
    (ii) States may not undertake any actions under any permit issued 
under this section if the activities adversely affect other migratory 
birds or species designated as endangered or threatened under the 
authority of the Endangered Species Act.
    (iii) We will only issue permits to State wildlife agencies in the 
conterminous United States.
    (iv) States may designate agents who must operate under the 
conditions of the permit.
    (v) How long is the special permit valid? A special Canada goose 
permit issued or renewed under this section expires on the date 
designated on the face of the permit unless it is amended or revoked or 
such time that we determine that the State's population of resident 
Canada geese no longer poses a threat to human health or safety, 
personal property, or injury to other interests. In all cases, the term 
of the permit may not exceed five (5) years from the date of issuance or 
renewal.

[[Page 68]]

    (vi) Can we revoke the special permit? We reserve the right to 
suspend or revoke any permit, as specified in Sec. Sec. 13.27 and 13.28 
of this subchapter.
    (e) What are the OMB information collection requirements of the 
permit program? OMB has approved the information collection requirements 
of the permit and assigned clearance number 1018-0099. Federal agencies 
may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, 
a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB 
control number. We will use the information collection requirements to 
administer this program and in the issuance and monitoring of these 
special permits. We will require the information from State wildlife 
agencies responsible for migratory bird management in order to obtain a 
special Canada goose permit, and to determine if the applicant meets all 
the permit issuance criteria, and to protect migratory birds. We 
estimate the public reporting burden for this collection of information 
to average 8 hours per response for 45 respondents (States), including 
the time for reviewing instructions, gathering and maintaining data 
needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. 
Thus, we estimate the total annual reporting and record-keeping for this 
collection to be 360 hours. States may send comments regarding this 
burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, 
including suggestions for reducing the burden, to the Service 
Information Collection Clearance Officer, Fish and Wildlife Service, ms 
224-ARLSQ, 1849 C Street N.W., Washington, DC 20240, or the Office of 
Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project 1018-0099, 
Washington, DC 20503.

Sec. 21.29  Federal falconry standards.

    (a) Before you can practice falconry in any State. You cannot take, 
possess, transport, sell, purchase, barter, or offer to sell, purchase, 
or barter any raptor for falconry purposes, in any State unless the 
State allows the practice of falconry, and the State has submitted 
copies of its laws and regulations governing the practice of falconry to 
us (Director), and we have determined that they meet or exceed the 
Federal falconry standards established in this section. If you are a 
Federal falconry permittee, you can possess and transport for falconry 
purposes a lawfully possessed raptor through States that do not allow 
falconry or meet Federal falconry standards so long as the raptors 
remain in transit in interstate commerce. The States that are in 
compliance with Federal falconry standards are listed in paragraph (k) 
of this section.
    (b) More restrictive State laws. Nothing in this section shall be 
construed to prevent a State from making and enforcing laws or 
regulations not inconsistent with the standards contained in any 
convention between the United States and any foreign country for the 
protection of raptors or with the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and which 
shall give further protection to raptors.
    (c) What is the process for Federal approval of a State program? Any 
State that wishes to allow the practice of falconry must submit to the 
Director of the Service a copy of the laws and regulations that govern 
the practice of falconry in the State. If we determine that they meet or 
exceed the Federal standards, which are established by this section, we 
will publish a notice in the Federal Register adding the State to the 
list of approved States in paragraph (k) of this section. Any State that 
was listed in paragraph (k) prior to September 14, 1989, is considered 
to be in compliance with our standards.
    (d) Permit. State laws or regulations shall provide that a valid 
State falconry permit from either that State or another State meeting 
Federal falconry standards and listed in paragraph (k) of this section 
is required before any person may take, possess, or transport a raptor 
for falconry purposes or practice falconry in that State.
    (e) Classes of permits. States may have any number of classes of 
falconry permits provided the standards are not less restrictive than 
the following:
    (1) Apprentice (or equivalent) class. (i) Permittee shall be at 
least 14 years old;
    (ii) A sponsor who is a holder of a General or Master Falconry 
Permit or equivalent class is required for the first two years in which 
an apprentice permit is held, regardless of the age of the permittee. A 
sponsor may not have more than three apprentices at any one time;
    (iii) Permittee shall not possess more than one raptor and may not 
obtain more than one raptor for replacement during any 12-month period; 
and
    (iv) Permittee shall possess only the following raptors which must 
be taken from the wild: an American kestrel (Falco sparverius), a red-
tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), a red-shouldered hawk (Buteo lineatus), 
or, in Alaska only, a goshawk (Accipiter gentilis).
    (2) General (or equivalent) class. (i) A permittee shall be at least 
18 years old;
    (ii) A permittee shall have at least two years experience in the 
practice of falconry at the apprentice level or its equivalent;
    (iii) A permittee may not possess more than two raptors and may not 
obtain more than two raptors for replacement birds during any 12-month 
period; and
    (iv) A permittee may not take, transport, or possess any golden 
eagle or any species listed as threatened or endangered in part 17 of 
this subchapter.
    (3) Master (or equivalent) class. (i) An applicant shall have at 
least five years experience in the practice of falconry at the general 
class level or its equivalent.
    (ii) A permittee may not possess more than three raptors and may not

[[Page 72]]

obtain more than two raptors taken from the wild for replacement birds 
during any 12-month period;
    (iii) A permittee may not take any species listed as endangered in 
part 17 of this chapter, but may transport or possess such species in 
accordance with part 17 of this chapter.
    (iv) A permittee may not take, transport, or possess any golden 
eagle for falconry purposes unless authorized in writing under Sec. 
22.24 of this subchapter;
    (v) A permittee may not take, in any twelve (12) month period, as 
part of the three-bird limitation, more than one raptor listed as 
threatened in part 17 of this chapter, and then only in accordance with 
part 17 of this chapter.
    (f) Examination. State laws or regulations shall provide that before 
any State falconry permit is issued the applicant shall be required to 
answer correctly at least 80 percent of the questions on a supervised 
examination provided or approved by the Service and administered by the 
State, relating to basic biology, care, and handling of raptors, 
literature, laws, regulations or other appropriate subject matter.
    (g) Facilities and equipment. Statelaws or regulations shall provide 
that before a State falconry permit is issued the applicant's raptor 
housing facilities and falconry equipment shall be inspected and 
certified by a representative of the State wildlife department as 
meeting the following standards:
    (1) Facilities. The primary consideration for raptor housing 
facilities whether indoors (mews) or outdoors (weathering area) is 
protection from the environment, predators, or undue disturbance. The 
applicant shall have the following facilities, except that depending 
upon climatic conditions, the issuing authority may require only one of 
the facilities described below.
    (i) Indoor facilities (mews) shall be large enough to allow easy 
access for caring for the raptors housed in the facility. If more than 
one raptor is to be kept in the mews, the raptors shall be tethered or 
separated by partitions and the area for each bird shall be large enough 
to allow the bird to fully extend its wings. There shall be at least one 
window, protected on the inside by vertical bars, spaced narrower than 
the width of the bird's body, and a secure door that can be easily 
closed. The floor of the mews shall permit easy cleaning and shall be 
well drained. Adequate perches shall be provided.
    (ii) Outdoor facilities (weathering area) shall be fenced and 
covered with netting or wire, or roofed to protect the birds from 
disturbance and attack by predators except that perches more than 6\1/2\ 
feet high need not be covered or roofed. The enclosed area shall be 
large enough to insure the birds cannot strike the fence when flying 
from the perch. Protection from excessive sun, wind, and inclement 
weather shall be provided for each bird. Adequate perches shall be 
provided.
    (2) Equipment. The following items shall be in the possession of the 
applicant before he can obtain a permit or license:
    (i) Jesses--At least 1 pair of Alymeri jesses or similar type 
constructed of pliable, high-quality leather or suitable synthetic 
material to be used when any raptor is flown free. (Traditional 1-piece 
jesses may be used on raptors when not being flown.);
    (ii) Leashes and swivels--At least 1 flexible, weather-resistant 
leash and 1 strong swivel of acceptable falconry design;
    (iii) Bath container--At least 1 suitable container, 2 to 6 inches 
deep and wider than the length of the raptor, for drinking and bathing 
for each raptor;
    (iv) Outdoor perches--At least 1 weathering area perch of an 
acceptable design shall be provided for each raptor; and
    (v) Weighing device--A reliable scale or balance suitable for 
weighing the raptor(s) held and graduated to increments of not more than 
\1/2\ ounce (15 gram) shall be provided.
    (3) Maintenance. All facilities and equipment shall be kept at or 
above the preceding standards at all times.
    (4) Transportation; temporary holding. A raptor may be transported 
or held in temporary facilities which shall be provided with an adequate 
perch and protected from extreme temperatures and excessive disturbance, 
for a period not to exceed 30 days.
    (h) Marking. All peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus), gyrfalcon 
(Falco rusticolus), and Harris hawk (Parabuteo

[[Page 73]]

unicinctus) possessed for falconry purposes must be marked in accordance 
with the following provisions:
    (1) Any peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), gyrfalcon (Falco 
rusticolus), or Harris hawk (Parabuteo unicinctus), except a captive 
bred raptor lawfully marked by a numbered, seamless band issued by the 
Service, must be banded with a permanent, non-reusable, numbered band 
issued by the Service.
    (2) Any peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), gyrfalcon (Falco 
rusticolus), or Harris hawk (Parabuteo unicinctus) possessed for 
falconry purposes must be banded at all times in accordance with these 
standards. Loss or removal of any band must be reported to the issuing 
office within five (5) working days of the loss and must be replaced 
with a permanent, non-reusable, numbered band supplied by the Service.
    (i) Taking restrictions. State laws or regulations shall provide the 
following restrictions on the taking of raptors from the wild:
    (1) Young birds not yet capable of flight (eyasses) may only be 
taken by a General or Master Falconer during the period specified by the 
State and no more than two eyasses may be taken by the same permittee 
during the specified period.
    (2) First-year (passage) birds may be taken only during the period 
specified by the State;
    (3) In no case shall the total of all periods of taking of eyasses 
or passage birds exceed 180 days during a calendar year, except that a 
marked raptor may be retrapped at any time; and
    (4) Only American kestrels (Falcosparverius) and great-horned owls 
(Bubo virginianus) may be taken when over one year old, except that any 
raptor other than endangered or threatened species taken under a 
depredation (or special purpose) permit may be used for falconry by 
General and Master falconers.
    (j) Other restrictions. State laws or regulations shall provide the 
following restrictions or conditions:
    (1) A person who possesses a lawfully acquired raptor before the 
enactment of these regulations and who fails to meet the permit 
requirements shall be allowed to retain the raptors. All such birds 
shall be identified with markers supplied by the Service and cannot be 
replaced if death, loss, release, or escape occurs.
    (2) If you possessed raptors before January 15, 1976, the date these 
regulations were enacted, and you had more than the number allowed under 
your permit, you may retain the extra raptors. However, each of those 
birds must be identified with markers we supplied, and you cannot 
replace any birds, nor can you obtain any additional raptors, until the 
number in your possession is at least one fewer than the total number 
authorized by the class of permit you hold.
    (3) A falconry permit holder shall obtain written authorization from 
the appropriate State wildlife department before any species not 
indigenous to that State is intentionally released to the wild, at which 
time the marker from the released bird shall be removed and surrendered 
to the State wildlife department. The marker from an intentionally 
released bird which is indigenous to that State shall also be removed 
and surrendered to the State wildlife department. A standard Federal 
bird band shall be attached to such birds by the State or Service-
authorized Federal bird bander whenever possible.
    (4) A raptor possessed under authority of a falconry permit may be 
temporarily held by a person other than the permittee only if that 
person is otherwise authorized to possess raptors, and only if the 
raptor is accompanied at all times by the properly completed form 3-186A 
(Migratory Bird Acquisition/Disposition Report) designating the 
permittee as the possessor of record and by a signed, dated statement 
from the permittee authorizing the temporary possession.
    (5) Feathers that are molted or those feathers from birds held in 
captivity that die, may be retained and exchanged by permittees only for 
imping purposes.
    (k) States meeting Federal falconry standards. We have determined 
that the following States meet or exceed the minimum Federal falconry 
standards established in this section for regulating the taking, 
possession, and transportation of raptors for the purpose of falconry.

Sec. 21.30  Raptor propagation permits.

    (a) Permit requirement. A raptor propagation permit is required 
before any person may take, possess, transport, import, purchase, 
barter, or offer to sell, purchase, or barter any raptor, raptor egg, or 
raptor semen for propagation purposes.
    (b) Application procedures. Submit application for raptor 
propagation permits to the appropriate Regional Director (Attention: 
Migratory bird permit office). You can find addresses for the Regional 
Directors in 50 CFR 2.2. Each application must contain the general 
information and certification required in Sec. 13.12(a) of this 
subchapter, and the following additional information:
    (1) A statement indicating the purpose(s) for which a raptor 
propagation permit is sought and, where applicable, the scientific or 
educational objectives of the applicant;
    (2) A statement indicating whether the applicant has been issued a 
State permit authorizing raptor propagation (include name of State, 
permit number, and expiration date);
    (3) A statement fully describing the nature and extent of the 
applicant's experience with raptor propagation or handling raptors;
    (4) A description of each raptor the applicant possesses or will 
acquire for propagation purposes to include the species, age (if known), 
sex (if known), date of acquisition, source, and raptor marker number;
    (5) A description of each raptor the applicant possesses for 
purposes other than raptor propagation to include the species, age (if 
known), sex (if known), date of acquisition, source, raptor marker 
number, and purpose for which it is possessed;
    (6) A description and photographs of the facilities and equipment to 
be used by the applicant including the dimensions of any structures 
intended for housing the birds;
    (7) A statement indicating whether the applicant requests authority 
to take raptors or raptor eggs from the wild.
    (c) Issuance criteria. Upon receiving an application completed in 
accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, the Director will decide 
whether a permit should be issued. In making this decision, the Director 
shall consider, in addition to the general criteria in Sec. 13.21(b) of 
this chapter, the following factors:
    (1) Whether an applicant's raptor propagation facilities are 
adequate for the number and species of raptors to be held under the 
permit.
    (2) Whether propagation is authorized by the State in which the 
propagation will occur, and if authorized, whether the applicant has any 
required State propagation permit.
    (3) Whether the applicant is at least 18 years old with a minimum of 
2 years experience handling raptors, and if the applicant requests 
authority to propagate endangered or threatened species, whether the 
applicant is at least 23 years old with a minimum of 7 years experience 
handling raptors.
    (4) If the applicant requests authority to take raptors or raptor 
eggs from the wild:
    (i) Whether issuance of the permit would have a significant effect 
on any wild population of raptors;
    (ii) Whether suitable captive stock is available; and
    (iii) Whether wild stock is needed to enhance the genetic 
variability of captive stock.

[[Page 75]]

    (d) Additional permit conditions. In addition to the general 
conditions found in part 13 of this chapter, raptor propagation permits 
are subject to the following additional conditions:
    (1) Facilities. Any tethered raptor possessed under this permit must 
be maintained in accordance with the Federal falconry standards for 
``facilities and equipment'' described in Sec. 21.29(g), unless a 
specific exception in writing is obtained. For untethered raptors, the 
breeding facilities must be soundly constructed and entirely enclosed 
with wood, wire netting, or other suitable material which provides a 
safe, health, environment. The design of such facilities and ancillary 
equipment must:
    (i) Minimize the risk of injury by providing protection from 
predators, disturbances that would likely cause harm, extreme weather 
conditions, and collision with interior or perimeter construction 
materials and equipment such as support poles, windows, wire netting, 
perches, or lights;
    (ii) Enhance sanitation by providing a well-drained floor, fresh air 
ventilation, source of light, fresh water for bathing and drinking, 
access for cleaning, and interior construction materials suitable for 
thorough cleaning or disinfection; and
    (iii) Enhance the welfare and breeding success of the raptors by 
providing suitable perches, nesting and feeding sites, and observation 
ports or inspection windows during times when disturbance is felt to be 
undesirable.
    (2) Incubation of eggs. Each permittee must notify the Director in 
writing within 5 days from the day the first egg is laid by any raptor 
held under a raptor propagation permit, but notice is not required more 
often than once every 60 days.
    (3) Marking requirement. Unless otherwise specifically exempted, 
every raptor possessed for propagation, including all progeny produced 
pursuant to the permitted activity, must be banded in accordance with 
the following provisions:
    (i) Except for captive-bred raptors lawfully marked with a seamless, 
numbered band provided by the Service, any raptor possessed for 
propagation purposes shall be banded with a permanent, non-reusable, 
numbered band issued by the Service.
    (ii) Unless specifically exempted by the conditions of the raptor 
propagation permit, each captive-bred raptor produced under authority of 
a raptor propagation permit shall be banded within two (2) weeks of 
hatching with a numbered, seamless band provided by the Service, placed 
on the raptor's leg (metatarsus). In marking captive-bred raptors, 
permittees:
    (A) Shall use a band with an opening (inside diameter) which is 
small enough to prevent its removal when the raptor is fully grown 
without causing serious injury to the raptor or damaging the bands 
integrity or one-piece construction;
    (B) May band a raptor with more than one size band when the 
potential diameter of the raptor's leg at maturity cannot be determined 
at the time of banding;
    (C) Shall remove all but one band from any raptor with more than one 
band before the raptor is five (5) weeks of age and return all bands 
removed to the issuing office.
    (iii) No raptor taken from the wild, produced from an egg taken from 
the wild, or produced from an egg from any source other than bred in 
captivity under authority of a raptor propagation permit may be banded 
with a numbered seamless band issued by the Service.
    (iv) No permittee under this section may band any raptor with any 
band issued or authorized by the Service unless that raptor is lawfully 
possessed by the permittee.
    (4) Taking Raptors or Raptor Eggs from the Wild. Any permit 
authorizing the permittee to take raptors or raptor eggs from the wild 
for propagation purposes is subject to the following additional 
restrictions:
    (i) The State or foreign country in which the raptors or raptor eggs 
are taken must authorize the permittee in writing to take raptors or 
raptor eggs from the wild for propagation purposes;
    (ii) No raptor listed in Sec. 17.11 of this chapter as 
``endangered'' or ``threatened'' may be taken from the wild without 
first obtaining the proper permit under part 17 of this chapter; and

[[Page 76]]

    (iii) No raptor or raptor egg may be taken from the wild except in 
accordance with State law.
    (5) Transfer, purchase, sale, or barter of raptors, raptor eggs, or 
raptor semen. (i) A permittee may transfer any lawfully possessed 
raptor, raptor egg, or raptor semen to another permittee or transfer any 
raptor to a falconer who holds a valid State falconry permit if no money 
or other consideration is involved.
    (ii) A permittee may transfer, purchase, sell, or barter any raptor 
which is banded with a numbered seamless marker provided or authorized 
by the Service, subject to the following conditions:
    (A) When the permittee purchases from, sells to, or barters with any 
person in the U.S., that person must be authorized under this part to 
purchase, sell, or barter captive-bred raptors;
    (B) When the permittee purchases from or barters with any person in 
a foreign country, that person must be authorized by the competent 
wildlife management authority of the foreign country in which the 
transaction occurs to sell or barter captive-bred raptors; and
    (C) When the permittee transfers to, sells to or barters with any 
person in a foreign country, that person must be authorized to possess, 
purchase or barter captive-bred raptors by the competent wildlife 
management authority of his/her country of residence or domicile and the 
same wildlife management authority must certify in writing that the 
recipient is an experienced falconer or raptor propagator who is 
required to maintain any raptors in his/her possession under conditions 
that are comparable to the conditions under which a permittee must 
maintain raptors under Sec. 21.29 or Sec. 21.30. No certification is 
required if the competent wildlife management authority itself is the 
recipient of captive-bred raptors for conservation purposes.
    (iii) No raptor may be traded, transferred, purchased, sold, or 
bartered until it is two weeks old and only after it is properly banded 
with a nonreuseable marker provided or authorized by the Service, unless 
it is transferred, sold, or bartered to a State or Federal wildlife 
management agency for conservation purposes.
    (iv) A permittee may purchase, sell, or barter semen collected from 
any captive-bred raptor.
    (v) A permittee may not purchase, sell or barter any raptor eggs, 
any raptors taken from the wild, any raptor semen collected from the 
wild, or any raptors hatched from eggs taken from the wild.
    (6) Use of Service form 3-186A. No permittee may take, purchase, 
receive, or otherwise acquire, sell, trade, barter, transfer, or 
otherwise dispose of any raptor unless such permittee submits a form 3-
186A (Migratory Bird Acquisition/Disposition Report), completed in 
accordance with the instructions on the form, to the issuing office 
within five (5) calendar days of any such transfer. Provided, that a 
permittee does not have to submit a form 3-186A (Migratory Bird 
Acquisition/Disposition Report) to report the acquisition raptors 
hatched from eggs produced as a result of the permittee's propagation 
activities as long as these raptors remain in the possession of the 
permittee.
    (7) Documentation of lawful possession. No raptor may be possessed 
under authority of a raptor propagation permit unless the permittee has 
a properly completed form 3-186A (Migratory Bird Acquisition/Disposition 
Report) for each bird possessed, except as provided in paragraph (d)(5) 
of this section.
    (8) Temporary possession. A raptor possessed under authority of a 
raptor propagation permit may be temporarily held by a person other than 
the permittee only if that person is otherwise authorized to possess 
raptors, and only if the raptor is accompanied at all times by the 
properly completed form 3-186A (Migratory Bird Acquisition/Disposition 
Report) designating the permittee as the possessor of record and by a 
signed, dated statement from the permittee authorizing the temporary 
possession.
    (9) Sale, purchase, barter. A permittee may not sell, purchase, 
barter, or offer to sell, purchase, or barter any raptor unless the 
raptor is marked on the metatarsus by a seamless, numbered band supplied 
by the Service.

[[Page 77]]

    (10) Transfer to another. A permittee may not receive or otherwise 
acquire from, may not transfer or otherwise dispose of to, and may not 
loan to or temporarily place with another person any raptor unless that 
person is authorized to acquire, possess, and dispose of such raptors 
under a valid permit issued pursuant to this part and part 13 or as 
permitted by regulations in this part.
    (11) Use in falconry. A permittee may use a raptor possessed for 
propagation in the sport of falconry only if such use is designated in 
both the propagation permit and the permittee's falconry permit.
    (12) Interspecific hybridization. Hybridization between species 
(interspecific hybridization) is authorized only if each raptor produced 
by interspecific hybridization is either imprinted on humans (hand-
raised in isolation from the sight of other raptors from two weeks of 
age until it is fully feathered) or surgically sterilized.
    (13) Possession of dead raptors, non-viable eggs, nests, and 
feathers. (i) Upon the death of any raptor held under permit, a 
permittee must remove the marker and immediately return it to the 
Director. The carcass must be destroyed immediately, unless the 
permittee requests authorization from the Director to retain possession 
of it. A permittee who has obtained written authorization from the 
Director to retain possession of the carcass may transfer it to any 
other person authorized by the Service to possess it, provided no money 
or other consideration is involved.
    (ii) A permittee may possess addled or blown eggs, nests, and 
feathers from raptors held under permit and may transfer any of these 
items to any other person authorized by the Service to possess them 
provided no money or other consideration is involved.
    (14) Intentional release to the wild. (i) A permittee must obtain 
written authorization from the Director and the Director of the wildlife 
conservation department of the State in which release to the wild is 
proposed before intentionally releasing any raptor to the wild. The 
raptor marker must be removed from each bird and immediately returned to 
the Director. A Federal bird band must be attached to each raptor by a 
person designated by the Director before its release.
    (ii) No raptor produced by interspecific hybridization may be 
intentionally released to the wild.

Sec. 21.31  Rehabilitation permits.

    (a) What is the permit requirement? Except as provided in Sec. 
21.12, a rehabilitation permit is required to take, temporarily possess, 
or transport any migratory bird for rehabilitation purposes. However, 
any person who finds a sick, injured, or orphaned migratory bird may, 
without a permit, take possession of the bird in order to immediately 
transport it to a permitted rehabilitator.
    (b) What are the general permit provisions? (1) The permit 
authorizes you to:
    (i) Take from the wild or receive from another person sick, injured, 
or orphaned migratory birds and to possess them and provide 
rehabilitative care for them for up to 180 days;
    (ii) Transport such birds to a suitable habitat for release, to 
another permitted rehabilitator's facilities, or to a veterinarian;
    (iii) Transfer, release, or euthanize such birds;
    (iv) Transfer or otherwise dispose of dead specimens; and
    (v) Receive, stabilize, and transfer within 48 hours types of 
migratory bird species not authorized by your permit, in cases of 
emergency. If a rehabilitator authorized to care for the bird is not 
available within that timeframe, you must contact the issuing office for 
authorization to retain the bird until it can be transferred.
    (2) The permit does not authorize the use of migratory birds for 
educational purposes.
    (c) How do I apply for a migratory bird rehabilitation permit? You 
must apply to the appropriate Regional Director--Attention Migratory 
Bird Permit Office. You can find addresses for the appropriate Regional 
Directors in Sec. 2.2 of subchapter A of this chapter. Your application 
package must consist of the following:
    (1) A completed application (Form 3-200-10b);

[[Page 79]]

    (2) A copy of your State rehabilitation permit, license, or other 
authorization, if one is required in your State; and
    (3) A check or money order made payable to the ``U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service'' in the amount of the application fee for permits 
issued under this section listed in Sec. 13.11 of this chapter.
    (d) What criteria will the Service consider before issuing a permit? 
(1) Upon receiving an application completed in accordance with paragraph 
(c) of this section, the Regional Director will decide whether to issue 
you a permit based on the general criteria of Sec. 13.21 of this 
chapter and whether you meet the following requirements:
    (i) You must be at least 18 years of age with at least 100 hours of 
hands-on experience, gained over the course of at least 1 whole year, 
rehabilitating the types of migratory birds you intend to rehabilitate 
(e.g., waterbirds, raptors), or comparable experience. Up to 20 hours of 
the 100-hour time requirement may be fulfilled by participation in 
migratory bird rehabilitation seminars and courses.
    (ii) Your facilities must be adequate to properly care for the 
type(s) of migratory bird species you intend to rehabilitate, or you 
must have a working relationship with a person or organization with such 
facilities.
    (iii) You must have an agreement with a licensed veterinarian to 
provide medical care for the birds you intend to rehabilitate, unless 
you are a licensed veterinarian.
    (iv) You must have a State permit, license, or other authorization 
to rehabilitate migratory birds if such authorization required by your 
State.
    (2) In issuing a permit, the Regional Director may place 
restrictions on the types of migratory bird species you are authorized 
to rehabilitate, based on your experience and facilities as well as on 
the specific physical requirements and behavioral traits of particular 
species.
    (e) What are the standard conditions for this permit? In addition to 
the general permit conditions set forth in part 13 of this chapter, 
rehabilitation permits are subject to the following conditions:
    (1) Facilities. You must conduct the activities authorized by this 
permit in appropriate facilities that are approved and identified on the 
face of your permit. In evaluating whether caging dimensions are 
adequate, the Service will use as a guideline the standards developed by 
the National Wildlife Rehabilitators Association and the International 
Wildlife Rehabilitation Council (Minimum Standards for Wildlife 
Rehabilitation, 2000).\1\ The Regional Migratory Bird Permit Office will 
authorize variation from the standards where doing so is reasonable and 
necessary to accommodate a particular rehabilitator's circumstances, 
unless a determination is made that such variation will jeopardize 
migratory birds. However, except as provided by paragraph (f)(2)(i) of 
this section, all facilities must adhere to the following criteria:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Copies may be obtained by contacting either the National 
Wildlife Rehabilitators Association: 14 North 7th Avenue, St. Cloud MN 
56303-4766, http://www.nwawildlife.org/default.asp; or the International 
Wildlife Rehabilitation Council: 829 Bancroft Way, Berkeley, CA 94710, 
http://www.iwrc-online.org.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (i) Rehabilitation facilities for migratory birds must be secure and 
provide protection from predators, domestic animals, undue human 
disturbance, sun, wind, and inclement weather.
    (ii) Caging must be made of a material that will not entangle or 
cause injury to the type of birds that will be housed within.
    (iii) Enclosures must be kept clean, well-ventilated, and hygienic.
    (iv) Birds must not be overcrowded, and must be provided enough 
perches, if applicable.
    (v) Birds must be housed only with compatible migratory bird 
species.
    (vi) Birds may not be displayed to the public unless you use video 
equipment, barriers, or other methods to reduce noise and exposure to 
humans to levels the birds would normally encounter in their habitat. 
You may not use any equipment for this purpose that causes stress or 
harm, or impedes the rehabilitation of any bird.
    (2) Dietary requirements. You must provide the birds in your care 
with a

[[Page 80]]

diet that is appropriate and nutritionally approximates the natural diet 
consumed by the species in the wild, with consideration for the age and 
health of the individual bird.
    (3) Subpermittees. Except as provided by paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of 
this section, anyone who will be performing activities that require 
permit authorization under paragraph (b)(1) of this section when you or 
a subpermittee are not present, including any individual who transports 
birds to or from your facility on a regular basis, must either possess 
his or her own Federal rehabilitation permit, or be authorized as your 
subpermittee by being named in writing to your issuing Migratory Bird 
Permit Office. Subpermittees must be at least 18 years of age and 
possess sufficient experience to tend the species in their care. 
Subpermittees authorized to care for migratory birds at a site other 
than your facility must have facilities adequate to house the species in 
their care, based on the criteria of paragraph (e)(1) of this section. 
All such facilities must be approved by the issuing office. As the 
primary permittee, you are legally responsible for ensuring that your 
subpermittees, staff, and volunteers adhere to the terms of your permit 
when conducting migratory bird rehabilitation activities.
    (4) Disposition of birds under your care. (i) You must take every 
precaution to avoid imprinting or habituating birds in your care to 
humans. If a bird becomes imprinted to humans while under your care, you 
will be required to transfer the bird as directed by the issuing office.
    (ii) You may not retain migratory birds longer than 180 days without 
additional authorization from your Regional Migratory Bird Permit 
Office. You must release all recuperated birds to suitable habitat as 
soon as seasonal conditions allow, following recovery of the bird. If 
the appropriate season for release is outside the 180-day timeframe, you 
must seek authorization from the Service to hold the bird until the 
appropriate season. Before releasing a threatened or endangered 
migratory bird, you must coordinate with your issuing Migratory Bird 
Permit Office.
    (iii) You must euthanize any bird that cannot feed itself, perch 
upright, or ambulate without inflicting additional injuries to itself 
where medical and/or rehabilitative care will not reverse such 
conditions. You must euthanize any bird that is completely blind, and 
any bird that has sustained injuries that would require amputation of a 
leg, a foot, or a wing at the elbow or above (humero-ulnar joint) rather 
than performing such surgery, unless:
    (A) A licensed veterinarian submits a written recommendation that 
the bird should be kept alive, including an analysis of why the bird is 
not expected to experience the injuries and/or ailments that typically 
occur in birds with these injuries and a commitment (from the 
veterinarian) to provide medical care for the bird for the duration of 
its life, including complete examinations at least once a year;
    (B) A placement is available for the bird with a person or facility 
authorized to possess it, where it will receive the veterinary care 
described in paragraph (e)(4)(iii)(A) of this section; and
    (C) The issuing office specifically authorizes continued possession, 
medical treatment, and rehabilitative care of the bird.
    (iv) You must obtain authorization from your issuing Migratory Bird 
Permit Office before euthanizing endangered and threatened migratory 
bird species. In rare cases, the Service may designate a disposition 
other than euthanasia for those birds. If Service personnel are not 
available, you may euthanize endangered and threatened migratory birds 
without Service authorization when prompt euthanasia is warranted by 
humane consideration for the welfare of the bird.
    (v) You may place nonreleasable live birds that are suitable for use 
in educational programs, foster parenting, research projects, or other 
permitted activities with persons permitted or otherwise authorized to 
possess such birds, with prior approval from your issuing Migratory Bird 
Permit Office.
    (vi)(A) You may donate dead birds and parts thereof, except 
threatened and endangered species, and bald and golden eagles, to 
persons authorized by

[[Page 81]]

permit to possess migratory bird specimens or exempted from permit 
requirements under Sec. 21.12.
    (B) You must obtain approval from your issuing office before 
disposing of or transferring any live or dead endangered or threatened 
migratory bird specimen, parts, or feathers.
    (C) You must send all dead bald and golden eagles, and their parts 
and feathers to: National Eagle Repository, Building 128, Rocky Mountain 
Arsenal, Commerce City, CO 80022. If your State requires you to notify 
State wildlife officers of a dead bald or golden eagle before sending 
the eagle to the Repository you must comply with State regulations. 
States may assume temporary possession of the carcasses for purposes of 
necropsy.
    (D) Unless specifically required to do otherwise by the Service, you 
must promptly destroy all other dead specimens by such means as are 
necessary to prevent any exposure of the specimens to animals in the 
wild.
    (vii) With authorization from your issuing Migratory Bird Permit 
Office, you may hold a nonreleasable bird longer than 180 days for the 
purpose of fostering juveniles during their rehabilitation. You may also 
use birds you possess under an educational permit to foster juveniles.
    (viii) You may possess a reasonable number of feathers for imping 
purposes, based on the numbers and species of birds for which you 
regularly provide care.
    (ix) You may draw blood and take other medical samples for purposes 
of the diagnosis and recovery of birds under your care, or for transfer 
to authorized facilities conducting research pertaining to a contagious 
disease or other public health hazard.
    (x) You may conduct necropsies on dead specimens in your possession, 
except that you must obtain approval from your Regional Migratory Bird 
Permit Office before conducting necropsies on threatened or endangered 
species.
    (xi) This permit does not confer ownership of any migratory bird. 
All birds held under this permit remain under the stewardship of the 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
    (5) Notification to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. (i) You must 
notify your issuing Migratory Bird Permit Office within 24 hours of 
acquiring a threatened or endangered migratory bird species, or bald or 
golden eagle, whether live or dead. You may be required to transfer 
these birds to another facility designated by the Service.
    (ii) You must immediately notify the local U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service Law Enforcement Office if you have reason to believe a bird has 
been poisoned, electrocuted, shot, or otherwise subjected to criminal 
activity. Contact information for your local Service Law Enforcement 
office is listed on your permit, or you can obtain it on the Internet at 
http://offices.fws.gov.
    (iii) If the sickness, injury, or death of any bird is due or likely 
due to avian virus, or other contagious disease or public health hazard, 
you must notify and comply with the instructions given by the State or 
local authority that is responsible for tracking the suspected disease 
or hazard in your location, if that agency is currently collecting such 
information from the public.
    (6) You must maintain a working relationship with a licensed 
veterinarian. If your working relationship with your original 
cooperating veterinarian is dissolved, you must establish an agreement 
within 30 days with another licensed veterinarian to provide medical 
services to the birds in your care, and furnish a copy of this agreement 
to the issuing office.
    (7) Recordkeeping. You must maintain complete and accurate records 
of all migratory birds that you receive, including for each bird the 
date received, type of injury or illness, disposition, and date of 
disposition. You must retain these records for 5 years following the end 
of the calendar year covered by the records.
    (8) Annual report. You must submit an annual report that includes 
the information required by paragraph (e)(7) for the preceding calendar 
year to your issuing Migratory Bird Permit Office by the date required 
on your permit. You may complete Service Form 3-202-4, or submit your 
annual report from a database you maintain, provided your

[[Page 82]]

report contains all, and only, the information required by Form 3-202-4.
    (9) At the discretion of the Regional Director, we may stipulate on 
the face of your permit additional conditions compatible with the permit 
conditions set forth in this section, to place limits on numbers and/or 
types of birds you may possess under your permit, to stipulate 
authorized location(s) for your rehabilitation activities, or otherwise 
specify permitted activities, based on your experience and facilities.
    (f) How does this permit apply to oil and hazardous waste spills? 
Prior to entering the location of an oil or hazardous material spill, 
you must obtain authorization from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
Field Response Coordinator or other designated Service representative 
and obtain permission from the On-Scene Coordinator. All activities 
within the location of the spill are subject to the authority of the On-
Scene Coordinator. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is responsible for 
the disposition of all migratory birds, dead or alive.
    (1) Permit provisions in oil or hazardous material spills. (i) In 
addition to the rehabilitation permit provisions set forth in paragraph 
(b) of this section, when under the authority of the designated U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service representative this permit further authorizes 
you to temporarily possess healthy, unaffected birds for the purpose of 
removing them from imminent danger.
    (ii) This permit does not authorize salvage of dead migratory birds. 
When dead migratory birds are discovered, a Service law enforcement 
officer must be notified immediately in order to coordinate the handling 
and collection of evidence. Contact information for your local Service 
Law Enforcement office is listed on your permit and on the Internet at 
http://offices.fws.gov. The designated Service representative will have 
direct control and responsibility over all live migratory birds, and 
will coordinate the collection, storage, and handling of any dead 
migratory birds with the Service's Division of Law Enforcement.
    (iii) You must notify your issuing Migratory Bird Permit Office of 
any migratory birds in your possession within 24 hours of removing such 
birds from the area.
    (2) Conditions specific to oil and hazardous waste spills--(i) 
Facilities. Facilities used at the scene of oil or hazardous waste 
spills may be temporary and/or mobile, and may provide less space and 
protection from noise and disturbance than facilities authorized under 
paragraph (e)(1) of this section. Such facilities should conform as 
closely as possible with the facility specifications contained in the 
Service policy titled Best Practices for Migratory Bird Care During Oil 
Spill Response.\2\

    \2\ You can obtain copies of this document by writing to the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service, Division of Environmental Quality, 4401 North 
Fairfax Drive, MS 322, Arlington, VA, 22203.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) Subpermittees. In cases of oil and hazardous waste spills, 
persons who assist with cleaning or treating migratory birds at the on-
scene facility will not be required to have a rehabilitation permit or 
be a subpermittee; however, volunteers must be trained in rescue 
protocol for migratory birds affected by oil and hazardous waste spills. 
A permit (or subpermittee designation) is required to perform extended 
rehabilitation of such birds, after initial cleaning and treating, at a 
subsequent location.
    (g) Will I also need a permit from the State in which I live? If 
your State requires a license, permit, or other authorization to 
rehabilitate migratory birds, your Federal migratory bird rehabilitation 
permit will not be valid if you do not also possess and adhere to the 
terms of the required State authorization, in addition to the Federal 
permit. Nothing in this section prevents a State from making and 
enforcing laws or regulations consistent with this section that are more 
restrictive or give further protection to migratory birds.
    (h) How long is a migratory bird rehabilitation permit valid? Your 
rehabilitation permit will expire on the date designated on the face of 
the permit unless amended or revoked. No rehabilitation permit will have 
a term exceeding 5 years.
    (i) Will I need to apply for a new permit under this section if I 
already have a special purpose permit to rehabilitate migratory birds, 
issued under Sec. 21.27 (Special

[[Page 83]]

purpose permits)? (1) If you had a valid Special Purpose--Migratory Bird 
Rehabilitation Permit issued under Sec. 21.27 on November 26, 2003, 
your permit will remain valid until the expiration date listed on its 
face. If you renew your permit, it will be issued under this section.
    (2) If your original permit authorization predates permit 
application procedures requiring submission of photographs and diagrams 
for approval of your facilities, and your facilities have never been 
approved by the migratory bird permit office on the basis of such 
photographs and diagrams, you must submit photographs and diagrams of 
your facilities as part of your renewal application. If those facilities 
do not meet the criteria set forth under this section, your permit may 
be renewed for only 1 year. We will re-evaluate your facilities when you 
seek renewal in a year. If you have made the improvements necessary to 
bring your facilities into compliance with paragraph (e)(1) of this 
section, and the other criteria within this section for permit issuance 
are met, your permit may be renewed for up to the full 5-year tenure.
    (3) If your facilities have already been approved on the basis of 
photographs and diagrams, and authorized under a valid Sec. 21.27 
special purpose permit, then they are preapproved to be authorized under 
your new permit issued under this section, unless those facilities have 
materially diminished in size or quality from what was authorized when 
you last renewed your permit, or unless you wish to expand the 
authorizations granted by your permit (e.g., the number or types of 
birds you rehabilitate). Regulations governing permit renewal are set 
forth in Sec. 13.22 of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 21.47  Depredation order for double-crested cormorants at 

aquaculture facilities.

    (a) What is the purpose of this depredation order? The purpose of 
this depredation order is to help reduce depredation of aquacultural 
stock by double-crested cormorants at private fish farms and State and 
Federal fish hatcheries.
    (b) In what areas can this depredation order be implemented? This 
depredation order applies to commercial freshwater aquaculture 
facilities and to State and Federal fish hatcheries in the States of 
Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, 
Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, and 
Texas.
    (c) What does this depredation order allow and who can participate? 
(1) This depredation order authorizes landowners, operators, and tenants 
(or their employees or agents) actually engaged in the commercial, 
Federal, or State production of freshwater aquaculture stocks to take, 
without a Federal permit, double-crested cormorants when they are found 
committing or about to commit depredations to aquaculture stocks. This 
authority is applicable only during daylight hours and only within the 
boundaries of freshwater commercial aquaculture facilities or State and 
Federal hatcheries.
    (2) This depredation order authorizes employees of the Wildlife 
Services program of the U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant 
Health Inspection Service to take double-crested cormorants, with 
appropriate landowner permission, at roost sites in the vicinity of 
aquaculture facilities, at any time, day or night, during the months of 
October, November, December, January, February, March, and April.
    (3) Authorized employees of the Wildlife Services program of the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection 
Service may designate agents to carry out control, provided these 
individuals act under the conditions of the order.
    (d) What are the terms and conditions of this order? (1) Persons 
operating under paragraph (c)(1) of this section may only do so in 
conjunction with an established nonlethal harassment program as 
certified by officials of the Wildlife Services program of the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. 
Wildlife Services directive 2.330 outlines this certification process.
    (2) Double-crested cormorants may be taken only by shooting with 
firearms, including rifles. Persons using

[[Page 87]]

shotguns are required to use nontoxic shot as listed in 50 CFR 20.21(j).
    (3) Persons operating under this depredation order may use decoys, 
taped calls, or other devices to lure within gun range birds committing 
or about to commit depredations.
    (4) Persons operating under this depredation order must obtain 
appropriate landowner permission before implementing activities 
authorized by the order.
    (5) Double-crested cormorants may not be killed contrary to the laws 
or regulations of any State, and none of the privileges of this section 
may be exercised unless the person possesses the appropriate State or 
other permits, if required.
    (6) Persons operating under this depredation order must properly 
dispose of double-crested cormorants killed in control efforts:
    (i) Individuals may donate birds killed under authority of this 
order to museums or other such scientific and educational institutions 
for the purposes of scientific or educational exhibition;
    (ii) Individuals may also bury or incinerate birds taken; and
    (iii) Individuals may not allow birds taken under this order, or 
their plumage, to be sold, offered for sale, bartered, or shipped for 
purpose of sale or barter.
    (7) Nothing in this depredation order authorizes the take of any 
migratory bird species other than double-crested cormorants. Two look-
alike species co-occur with double-crested cormorants in the 
southeastern States: the anhinga, which occurs across the southeastern 
United States, and the neotropic cormorant, which is found in varying 
numbers in Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma. Both species can be mistaken 
for double-crested cormorants, but take of these two species is not 
authorized under this depredation order. Persons operating under this 
order must immediately report the take of a migratory bird species other 
than double-crested cormorants to the appropriate Service Regional 
Migratory Bird Permit Office.
    (8) Nothing in this depredation order authorizes the take of any 
species protected by the Endangered Species Act. Persons operating under 
this order must immediately report the take of species protected under 
the Endangered Species Act to the Service.
    (i) To protect wood storks and bald eagles, the following 
conservation measures must be observed within any geographic area where 
Endangered Species Act protection applies to these species: All control 
activities are allowed if the activities occur more than 1,500 feet from 
active wood stork nesting colonies, more than 1,000 feet from active 
wood stork roost sites, and more than 750 feet from feeding wood storks, 
and if they occur more than 750 feet from active bald eagle nests.
    (ii) At their discretion, landowners, operators, and tenants may 
contact the Regional Migratory Bird Permit Office to request 
modification of the measures listed in paragraph (d)(8)(i) of this 
section. Such modification can occur only if the Regional Director 
determines, on the basis of coordination between the Regional Migratory 
Bird Permit Office and the Endangered Species Field Office, that wood 
storks and bald eagles will not be adversely affected.
    (iii) If adverse effects are anticipated from the control activities 
in a geographical area where Endangered Species Act protection applies 
to wood storks or bald eagles, either during the intra-Service 
coordination discussions described above or at any other time, the 
Regional Migratory Bird Permit Office will initiate consultation with 
the Endangered Species Field Offices.
    (9) Persons operating under this depredation order must:
    (i) Keep a log recording the date, number, and location of all birds 
killed each year under this authorization;
    (ii) Maintain this log for a period of 3 years (and maintain records 
for 3 previous years of takings at all times thereafter); and
    (iii) Each year, provide the previous year's log to the appropriate 
Service Regional Migratory Bird Permit Office. Regional Office addresses 
are found in Sec. 2.2 of subchapter A of this chapter.
    (10) We reserve the right to suspend or revoke the authority of any 
Agency or individual granted by this order if we find that the specified 
purpose, terms, and conditions have not been

[[Page 88]]

adhered to by that Agency or individual or if the long-term 
sustainability of double-crested cormorant populations is threatened by 
that Agency's or individual's action(s). The criteria and procedures for 
suspension, revocation, reconsideration, and appeal are outlined in 
Sec. Sec. 13.27 through 13.29 of this subchapter. For the purposes of 
this section, ``issuing officer'' means the Regional Director and 
``permit'' means the authority to act under this depredation order. For 
purposes of Sec. 13.29(e), appeals shall be made to the Director.
    (e) Does this section contain information collection requirements? 
Yes, the information collection requirements in this section are 
approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under OMB control 
number 1018-0121. Federal agencies may not conduct or sponsor, and you 
are not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    (f) When does this depredation order expire? This depredation order 
will automatically expire on April 30, 2009, unless revoked or extended 
prior to that date.

<R05>
Sec. 21.48  Depredation order for double-crested cormorants to protect

public resources.

    (a) What is the purpose of this depredation order? The purpose of 
this depredation order is to reduce the occurrence and/or minimize the 
risk of adverse impacts to public resources (fish, wildlife, plants, and 
their habitats) caused by double-crested cormorants.
    (b) In what areas can this depredation order be implemented? This 
depredation order applies to all lands and freshwaters in the States of 
Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, 
Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, New 
York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, 
Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.
    (c) What does this depredation order allow and who can participate? 
(1) This depredation order authorizes State fish and wildlife agencies, 
Federally recognized Tribes, and State Directors of the Wildlife 
Services program of the U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant 
Health Inspection Service (collectively termed ``Agencies'') to prevent 
depredations on the public resources of fish (including hatchery stock 
at Federal, State, and Tribal facilities), wildlife, plants, and their 
habitats by taking without a permit double-crested cormorants found 
committing or about to commit, such depredations.
    (2) Agencies may designate agents to carry out control, provided 
those individuals act under the conditions of the order.
    (3) Federally recognized Tribes and their agents may carry out 
control only on reservation lands or ceded lands within their 
jurisdiction.
    (d) What are the terms and conditions of this order? (1) Persons 
operating under this order should first utilize nonlethal control 
methods such as harassment and exclusion devices when these are 
considered effective and practicable and not harmful to other nesting 
birds by the responsible Agency.
    (2) Double-crested cormorants may be taken only by means of egg 
oiling, egg and nest destruction, cervical dislocation, firearms, and 
CO<INF>2</INF> asphyxiation. Persons using shotguns must use nontoxic 
shot, as listed in 50 CFR 20.21(j). Persons using egg oiling must use 
100 percent corn oil, a substance exempted from regulation by the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency under the Federal Insecticide, 
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act.
    (3) Persons operating under this depredation order may use decoys, 
taped calls, or other devices to lure within gun range birds committing 
or about to commit depredation of public resources.
    (4) Persons operating under this depredation order must obtain 
appropriate landowner permission before implementing activities 
authorized by the order.
    (5) Persons operating under this depredation order may not take 
double-crested cormorants contrary to the laws or regulations of any 
State, and none of the privileges of this section may be exercised 
unless the person possesses the appropriate State or other permits, if 
required.

[[Page 89]]

    (6) Persons operating under this depredation order must properly 
dispose of double-crested cormorants killed in control efforts:
    (i) Individuals may donate birds killed under authority of this 
order to museums or other such scientific and educational institutions 
for the purposes of scientific or educational exhibition;
    (ii) Individuals may also bury or incinerate birds taken; and
    (iii) Individuals may not allow birds taken under this order, or 
their plumage, to be sold, offered for sale, bartered, or shipped for 
purpose of sale or barter.
    (7) Nothing in this depredation order authorizes the take of any 
migratory bird species other than double-crested cormorants. Two look-
alike species co-occur with double-crested cormorants in the 
southeastern States: the anhinga, which occurs across the southeastern 
United States, and the neotropic cormorant, which is found in varying 
numbers in Texas, Louisiana, Kansas, and Oklahoma. Both species can be 
mistaken for double-crested cormorants, but take of these two species is 
not authorized under this depredation order. Persons operating under 
this order must immediately report the take of a migratory bird species 
other than double-crested cormorants to the appropriate Service Regional 
Migratory Bird Permit Office.
    (8) Nothing in this depredation order authorizes the take of any 
species protected by the Endangered Species Act. Persons operating under 
this order must immediately report the take of species protected under 
the Endangered Species Act to the Service.
    (i) To protect piping plovers, interior least terns, wood storks, 
and bald eagles, the following conservation measures must be observed 
within any geographic area where Endangered Species Act protection 
applies to these species:
    (A) The discharge/use of firearms to kill or harass double-crested 
cormorants or use of other harassment methods are allowed if the control 
activities occur more than 1,000 feet from active piping plover or 
interior least tern nests or colonies; occur more than 1,500 feet from 
active wood stork nesting colonies, more than 1,000 feet from active 
wood stork roost sites, and more than 750 feet from feeding wood storks; 
or occur more than 750 feet from active bald eagle nests;
    (B) Other control activities such as egg oiling, cervical 
dislocation, CO<INF>2</INF> asphyxiation, egg destruction, or nest 
destruction are allowed if these activities occur more than 500 feet 
from active piping plover or interior least tern nests or colonies; 
occur more than 1,500 feet from active wood stork nesting colonies, more 
than 1,000 feet from active wood stork roost sites, and more than 750 
feet from feeding wood storks; or occur more than 750 feet from active 
bald eagle nests;
    (C) To ensure adequate protection of piping plovers, any Agency or 
its agents who plan to implement control activities that may affect 
areas designated as piping plover critical habitat in the Great Lakes 
Region are to obtain prior approval from the appropriate Regional 
Director. Requests for approval of activities in these areas must be 
submitted to the Regional Migratory Bird Permit Office. The Regional 
Migratory Bird Permit Office will then coordinate with the Endangered 
Species Field Office staff to assess whether the measures in paragraph 
(d)(8)(i)(B) of this section are adequate.
    (ii) At their discretion, Agencies or their agents may contact the 
Regional Migratory Bird Permit Office to request modification of the 
above measures. Such modification can occur only if the Regional 
Director determines, on the basis of coordination between the Regional 
Migratory Bird Permit Office and the Endangered Species Field Office, 
that the species listed in paragraph (d)(8)(i) of this section will not 
be adversely affected.
    (iii) If adverse effects are anticipated from the control activities 
in a geographical area where Endangered Species Act protection applies 
to any of the four species listed in paragraph (d)(8)(i) of this 
section, either during the intra-Service coordination discussions 
described in paragraph (d)(8)(i)(C) of this section or at any other 
time, the Regional Migratory Bird Permit Office will initiate 
consultation with the Endangered Species Field Offices.

[[Page 90]]

    (9) Responsible Agencies must, before they initiate any control 
activities in a given year, provide a one-time written notice to the 
appropriate Service Regional Migratory Bird Permit Office indicating 
that they intend to act under this order.
    (i) Additionally, if any Agency plans a single control action that 
would individually, or a succession of such actions that would 
cumulatively, kill more than 10 percent of the double-crested cormorants 
in a breeding colony, it must first provide written notification to the 
appropriate Service Regional Migratory Bird Permit Office. This letter 
must be received no later than 30 days in advance of the activity and 
must provide:
    (A) The location (indicating specific colonies, if applicable) of 
the proposed control activity;
    (B) A description of the proposed control activity, specifying what 
public resources are being impacted, how many birds are likely to be 
taken and what approximate percentage they are of total DCCOs present, 
and which species of other birds are present; and
    (C) Contact information for the person in charge of the control 
action.
    (ii) The Regional Director may prevent any such activity by 
notifying the agency in writing if the Regional Director deems the 
activity a threat to the long-term sustainability of double-crested 
cormorants or any other migratory bird species.
    (10) Persons operating under this order must keep records of all 
activities, including those of designated agents, carried out under this 
order. On an annual basis, Agencies must provide the Service Regional 
Migratory Bird Permit Office with a report detailing activities 
conducted under the authority of this order, including:
    (i) By date and location, a summary of the number of double-crested 
cormorants killed and/or number of nests in which eggs were oiled;
    (ii) A statement of efforts being made to minimize incidental take 
of nontarget species and a report of the number and species of migratory 
birds involved in such take, if any;
    (iii) A description of the impacts or anticipated impacts to public 
resources by double-crested cormorants and a statement of the management 
objectives for the area in question;
    (iv) A description of the evidence supporting the conclusion that 
double-crested cormorants are causing or will cause these impacts;
    (v) A discussion of other limiting factors affecting the resource 
(e.g., biological, environmental, and socioeconomic); and
    (vi) A discussion of how control efforts are expected to, or 
actually did, alleviate resource impacts.
    (11) Agencies must provide annual reports to the appropriate Service 
Regional Migratory Bird Permit Office, as described in paragraph (d)(10) 
of this section, by December 31 for the reporting period October 1 of 
the previous year to September 30 of the same year. For example, reports 
for the period October 1, 2003, to September 30, 2004, would be due on 
or before December 31, 2004. The Service will regularly review Agency 
reports and will periodically assess the overall impact of this program 
to ensure compatibility with the long-term conservation of double-
crested cormorants and other resources.
    (12) In some situations, Agencies may deem it necessary to reduce or 
eliminate local breeding populations of double-crested cormorants to 
reduce the occurrence of resource impacts.
    (i) For such actions, Agencies must:
    (A) Comply with paragraph (d)(9) of this section;
    (B) Carefully plan activities to avoid disturbance of nontarget 
species;
    (C) Evaluate effects of management activities on cormorants at the 
control site;
    (D) Evaluate, by means of collecting data or using best available

Sec. 21.49  Control order for resident Canada geese at airports and

military airfields.

    (a) Which Canada geese are covered by this order? This regulation 
addresses the control and management of resident Canada geese, as 
defined in Sec. 21.3.
    (b) What is the control order for resident Canada geese at airports, 
and what is its purpose? The airport control order authorizes managers 
at commercial, public, and private airports (airports) (and their 
employees or their agents) and military air operation facilities 
(military airfields) (and their employees or their agents) to establish 
and implement a control and management program when necessary to resolve 
or prevent threats to public safety from resident Canada geese. Control 
and management activities include indirect and/or direct control 
strategies such as trapping and relocation, nest and egg destruction, 
gosling and adult trapping and culling programs, or other lethal and 
non-lethal control strategies.
    (c) Who may participate in the program? To be designated as an 
airport that is authorized to participate in this program, an airport 
must be part of the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems and have 
received Federal grant-in-aid assistance, or a military airfield, 
meaning an airfield or air station that is under the jurisdiction, 
custody, or control of the Secretary of a military department. Only 
airports and military airfields in the lower 48 States and the District 
of Columbia are eligible to conduct and implement the various resident 
Canada goose control and management program components.
    (d) What are the restrictions of the control order for resident 
Canada geese at airports and military airfields? The airport control 
order for resident Canada geese is subject to the following 
restrictions:
    (1) Airports and military airfields should use nonlethal goose 
management tools to the extent they deem appropriate. To minimize lethal 
take, airports and military airfields should follow this procedure:
    (i) Assess the problem to determine its extent or magnitude, its 
impact on current operations, and the appropriate control method to be 
used.
    (ii) Base control methods on sound biological, environmental, 
social, and cultural factors.
    (iii) Formulate appropriate methods into a control strategy that 
uses several control techniques rather than relying on a single method.
    (iv) Implement all appropriate nonlethal management techniques (such 
as harassment and habitat modification) in conjunction with take 
authorized under this order.
    (2)(i) Methods of take for the control of resident Canada geese are 
at the airport's and military airfield's discretion from among the 
following:
    (A) Egg oiling,
    (B) Egg and nest destruction,
    (C) Shooting,
    (D) Lethal and live traps,
    (E) Nets,
    (F) Registered animal drugs, pesticides, and repellants,
    (G) Cervical dislocation, and
    (H) CO<INF>2</INF> asphyxiation.

[[Page 92]]

    (ii) Birds caught live may be euthanized or transported and 
relocated to another site approved by the State or Tribal wildlife 
agency, if required.
    (iii) All techniques used must be in accordance with other Federal, 
State, and local laws, and their use must comply with any labeling 
restrictions.
    (iv) Persons using shotguns must use nontoxic shot, as listed in 
Sec. 20.21(j) of this subchapter.
    (v) Persons using egg oiling must use 100 percent corn oil, a 
substance exempted from regulation by the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act.
    (3) Airports and military airfields may conduct management and 
control activities, involving the take of resident Canada geese, under 
this section between April 1 and September 15. The destruction of 
resident Canada goose nests and eggs may take place between March 1 and 
June 30.
    (4) Airports and military airfields and their employees and agents 
may possess, transport, and otherwise dispose of resident Canada geese 
taken under this section. Disposal of birds taken under this order may 
be by donation to public museums or public institutions for scientific 
or educational purposes, processing for human consumption and subsequent 
distribution free of charge to charitable organizations, or burial or 
incineration. Airports/military airfields, their employees, and 
designated agents may not sell, offer for sale, barter, or ship for the 
purpose of sale or barter any resident Canada geese taken under this 
section, nor their plumage or eggs. Any specimens needed for scientific 
purposes as determined by the Regional Director must not be destroyed, 
and information on birds carrying metal leg bands must be submitted to 
the Bird Banding Laboratory by means of a toll-free telephone number at 
1-800-327-BAND (or 2263).
    (5) Resident Canada geese may be taken only within the airport, or 
the military base on which a military airfield is located, or within a 
3-mile radius of the outer boundary of such a facility. Airports and 
military airfields or their agents must first obtain all necessary 
authorizations from landowners for all management activities conducted 
outside the airport or military airfield's boundaries and be in 
compliance with all State and local laws and regulations.
    (6) Nothing in this section authorizes the killing of resident 
Canada geese or destruction of their nests and eggs contrary to the laws 
or regulations of any State or Tribe, and none of the privileges of this 
section may be exercised unless the airport or military airfield 
possesses the appropriate State or Tribal authorization or other permits 
required by the State or Tribe. Moreover, this section does not 
authorize the killing of any migratory bird species or destruction of 
their nest or eggs other than resident Canada geese.
    (7) Authorized airports and military airfields, and their employees 
and agents operating under the provisions of this section may not use 
decoys, calls, or other devices to lure birds within gun range.
    (8) Airports and military airfields exercising the privileges 
granted by this section must submit an annual report summarizing 
activities, including the date and numbers and location of birds, nests, 
and eggs taken, by December 31 of each year to the Regional Migratory 
Bird Permit Office listed in Sec. 2.2 of this subchapter.
    (9) Nothing in this section applies to any Federal land without 
written permission of the Federal agency with jurisdiction.
    (10) Airports and military airfields may not undertake any actions 
under this section if the activities adversely affect other migratory 
birds or species designated as endangered or threatened under the 
authority of the Endangered Species Act. Persons operating under this 
order must immediately report the take of any species protected under 
the Endangered Species Act to the Service. Further, to protect certain 
species from being adversely affected by management actions, airports 
and military airfields must:
    (i) Follow the Federal-State Contingency Plan for the whooping 
crane;
    (ii) Conduct no activities within 300 meters of a whooping crane or 
Mississippi sandhill crane nest;

[[Page 93]]

Sec. 21.52  Public health control order for resident Canada geese.

    (a) Which Canada geese are covered by this order? This regulation 
addresses the control and management of resident Canada geese, as 
defined in Sec. 21.3.
    (b) What is the public health control order for resident Canada 
geese, and what is its purpose? The public health control order for 
resident Canada geese authorizes States, Tribes, and the District of 
Columbia, via the State or Tribal wildlife agency, to conduct resident 
Canada goose control and management activities including direct control 
strategies such as trapping and relocation, nest and egg destruction, 
gosling and adult trapping and culling programs, or other lethal and 
non-lethal wildlife damage-management strategies when resident Canada 
geese are posing a direct threat to human health.
    (c) What is a direct threat to human health? A direct threat to 
human health is one where a Federal, State, Tribal, or local public 
health agency has determined that resident Canada geese pose a specific, 
immediate human health threat by creating conditions conducive to the 
transmission of human or zoonotic pathogens. The State or Tribe may not 
use this control order for situations in which resident Canada geese are 
merely causing a nuisance.
    (d) Who may participate in the program? Only State and Tribal 
wildlife agencies in the lower 48 States and the District of Columbia 
(or their employees or agents) may conduct and implement the various 
components of the public health control order for resident Canada geese.
    (e) What are the restrictions of the public health depredation order 
for resident Canada geese? The public health control order for resident 
Canada geese is subject to the following restrictions:
    (1) Authorized State and Tribal wildlife agencies should use 
nonlethal goose management tools to the extent they deem appropriate.
    (2)(i) Methods of take for the control of resident Canada geese are 
at the State's and Tribe's discretion from among the following:
    (A) Egg oiling,
    (B) Egg and nest destruction,
    (C) Shotguns,
    (D) Lethal and live traps,
    (E) Nets,
    (F) Registered animal drugs, pesticides, and repellants,
    (G) Cervical dislocation, and
    (H) CO<INF>2</INF> asphyxiation.
    (ii) Birds caught live may be euthanized or transported and 
relocated to another site approved by the State or Tribal wildlife 
agency, if required.
    (iii) All techniques used must be in accordance with other Federal, 
State, Tribal, and local laws, and their use must comply with any 
labeling restrictions.
    (iv) Persons using shotguns must use nontoxic shot, as listed in 
Sec. 20.21(j) of this subchapter.
    (v) Persons using egg oiling must use 100 percent corn oil, a 
substance exempted from regulation by the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act.
    (3) Authorized State and Tribal wildlife agencies and their 
employees and agents may conduct management and control activities, 
involving the take of resident Canada geese, under this section between 
April 1 and August 31. The destruction of resident Canada goose nests 
and eggs may take place between March 1 and June 30.
    (4) Authorized State and Tribal wildlife agencies and their 
employees and agents may possess, transport, and otherwise dispose of 
resident Canada geese taken under this section. Disposal of birds taken 
under this order may be by donation to public museums or public 
institutions for scientific or educational purposes, processing for 
human consumption and subsequent distribution free of charge to 
charitable organizations, or burial or incineration. States, their 
employees, and designated agents may not sell, offer for sale, barter, 
or ship for the purpose of sale or barter any resident Canada

[[Page 99]]

geese taken under this section, nor their plumage or eggs. Any specimens 
needed for scientific purposes as determined by the Regional Director 
must not be destroyed, and information on birds carrying metal leg bands 
must be submitted to the Bird Banding Laboratory by means of a toll-free 
telephone number at 1-800-327-BAND (or 2263).
    (5) Resident Canada geese may be taken only within the specified 
area of the direct threat to human health.
    (6) Authorized State and Tribal wildlife agencies, and their 
employees and agents operating under the provisions of this section may 
not use decoys, calls, or other devices to lure birds within gun range.
    (7) No person conducting activities under this section should 
construe the program as authorizing the killing of resident Canada geese 
or destruction of their nests and eggs contrary to any State law or 
regulation, nor may any control activities be conducted on any Federal 
land without specific authorization by the responsible management 
agency. No person may exercise the privileges granted under this section 
unless they possess any permits required for such activities by any 
State or Federal land manager.
    (8) Any State or Tribal employee or designated agent authorized to 
carry out activities under this section must have a copy of the State's 
or Tribal authorization and designation in their possession when 
carrying out any activities. If the State or Tribe is conducting 
operations on private property, the State or Tribe must also require the 
property owner or occupant on whose premises resident Canada goose 
activities are being conducted to allow, at all reasonable times, 
including during actual operations, free and unrestricted access to any 
Service special agent or refuge officer, State or Tribal wildlife or 
deputy wildlife agent, warden, protector, or other wildlife law 
enforcement officer on the premises where they are, or were, conducting 
activities. Furthermore, any State or Tribal employee or designated 
agent conducting such activities must promptly furnish whatever 
information is required concerning such activities to any such wildlife 
officer.
    (9) States and Tribes exercising the privileges granted by this 
section must submit an annual report summarizing activities, including 
the numbers and County of birds taken, by December 31 of each year to 
the Regional Migratory Bird Permit Office listed in Sec. 2.2 of this 
subchapter.
    (10) Authorized State and Tribal wildlife agencies may not undertake 
any actions under this section if the activities adversely affect other 
migratory birds or species designated as endangered or threatened under 
the authority of the Endangered Species Act. Persons operating under 
this order must immediately report the take of any species protected 
under the Endangered Species Act to the Service. Further, to protect 
certain species from being adversely affected by management actions, 
State and Tribal wildlife agencies must:
    (i) Follow the Federal-State Contingency Plan for the whooping 
crane;
    (ii) Conduct no activities within 300 meters of a whooping crane or 
Mississippi sandhill crane nest;
    (iii) Follow all Regional (or National when available) Bald Eagle 
Nesting Management guidelines for all management activities;
    (iv) Contact the Arizona Fish and Wildlife Service Ecological 
Services Office (for the Colorado River and Arizona sites) or the 
Carlsbad Fish and Wildlife Office (for Salton Sea sites) if control 
activities are proposed in or around occupied habitats (cattail or 
cattail bulrush marshes) to discuss the proposed activity and ensure 
that implementation will not adversely affect clapper rails or their 
habitats; and
    (v) In California, any control activities of resident Canada geese 
in areas used by the following species listed under the Endangered 
Species Act must be done in coordination with the appropriate local FWS 
field office and in accordance with standard local operating procedures 
for avoiding adverse effects to the species or its critical habitat:
    (A) Birds: Light-footed clapper rail, California clapper rail, Yuma 
clapper rail, California least tern, southwestern willow flycatcher, 
least Bell's vireo, western snowy plover, California gnatcatcher.

Greene's tuctoria, Sacramento Valley Orcutt grass, San Joaquin Valley 
Orcutt grass, slender Orcutt grass, California Orcutt grass, spreading 
navarretia, and San Jacinto Valley crownscale.
    (f) Can the control order be suspended? We reserve the right to 
suspend or revoke a State's or Tribe's authority under this program if 
we find that the terms and conditions specified in the depredation order 
have not been adhered to by that agency. Final decisions to revoke 
authority will be made by the appropriate Regional Director. The 
criteria and procedures for suspension, revocation, reconsideration, and 
appeal are outlined in Sec. Sec. 13.27 through 13.29 of this 
subchapter. For the purposes of this section, ``issuing officer'' means 
the Regional Director and ``permit'' means the authority to act under 
this control order. For purposes of Sec. 13.29(e), appeals must be made 
to the Director. Additionally, at such time that we determine that 
resident Canada geese populations no longer pose direct threats to human 
health, we may choose to terminate part or all of the control order by 
subsequent regulation. In all cases, we will annually review the 
necessity and effectiveness of the control order.
    (g) Has the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approved the 
information collection requirements of the control order? OMB has 
approved the information collection and recordkeeping requirements of 
the control order under OMB control number 1018-0133. We may not conduct 
or sponsor, and you are not required to respond to, a collection of 
information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. You 
may send comments on the information collection and recordkeeping 
requirements to the Service's Information Collection Clearance Officer,

[[Page 101]]

State Highway 361 to Port Aransas, thence east along the Corpus Christi 
Channel, thence southeast along the Aransas Channel, extending to 5 
nautical miles offshore; except that it is lawful to take mid-continent 
light geese after 10 March of each year within the Guadalupe WMA. If at 
any time we receive evidence that a need to close the areas in this 
paragraph (b)(3) no longer exists, we will publish a proposal to remove 
the closures in the Federal Register.
    (c) What is required in order for State/Tribal governments to 
participate in the conservation order? Any State or Tribal government 
responsible for the management of wildlife and migratory birds may, 
without permit, kill or cause to be killed under its general 
supervision, mid-continent light geese under the following conditions:
    (1) Activities conducted under this section may not affect 
endangered or threatened species as designated under the Endangered 
Species Act.
    (2) Control activities must be conducted clearly as such and are 
intended to relieve pressures on migratory birds and habitat essential 
to migratory bird populations only and are not to be construed as 
opening, re-opening, or extending any open hunting season contrary to 
any regulations promulgated under section 3 of the Migratory Bird Treaty 
Act.
    (3) Control activities may be conducted only when all waterfowl and 
crane hunting seasons, excluding falconry, are closed.
    (4) Control measures employed through this section may be 
implemented only between the hours of one-half hour before sunrise to 
one-half hour after sunset.
    (5) Nothing in this section may limit or initiate management actions 
on Federal land without concurrence of the Federal Agency with 
jurisdiction.
    (6) States and Tribes must designate participants who must operate 
under the conditions of this section.
    (7) States and Tribes must inform participants of the requirements/
conditions of this section that apply.
    (8) States and Tribes must keep records of activities carried out 
under the authority of this section, including the number of mid-
continent light geese taken under this section, the methods by which 
they were taken, and the dates they were taken. The States and Tribes 
must submit an annual report summarizing activities conducted under this 
section on or before August 30 of each year, to the Chief, Division of 
Migratory Bird Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, ms 634--
ARLSQ, 1849 C Street NW., Washington, DC 20240.
    (d) What is required in order for individuals to participate in the 
conservation order? Individual participants in State or tribal programs 
covered by this section are required to comply with the following 
requirements:
    (1) Nothing in this section authorizes the take of mid-continent 
light geese contrary to any State or Tribal laws or regulations; and 
none of the privileges granted under this section may be exercised 
unless persons acting under the authority of the conservation order 
possesses whatever permit or other authorization(s) required for such 
activities by the State or Tribal government concerned.
    (2) Participants who take mid-continent light geese under this 
section may not sell or offer for sale those birds nor their plumage, 
but may possess, transport, and otherwise properly use them.
    (3) Participants acting under the authority of this section must 
permit at all reasonable times, including during actual operations, any 
Federal or State game or deputy game agent, warden, protector, or other 
game law enforcement officer free and unrestricted access over the 
premises on which such operations have been or are being conducted, and 
must promptly furnish whatever information an officer requires 
concerning the operation.
    (4) Participants acting under the authority of this section may take 
mid-continent light geese by any method except those prohibited as 
follows:
    (i) With a trap, snare, net, rifle, pistol, swivel gun, shotgun 
larger than 10 gauge, punt gun, battery gun, machine gun, fish hook, 
poison, drug, explosive, or stupefying substance;
    (ii) From or by means, aid, or use of a sinkbox or any other type of 
low

[[Page 102]]

floating device, having a depression affording the person a means of 
concealment beneath the surface of the water;
    (iii) From or by means, aid, or use of any motor vehicle, motor-
driven land conveyance, or aircraft of any kind, except that paraplegics 
and persons missing one or both legs may take from any stationary motor 
vehicle or stationary motor-driven land conveyance;
    (iv) From or by means of any motorboat or other craft having a motor 
attached, or any sailboat, unless the motor has been completely shut off 
and the sails furled, and its progress therefrom has ceased. A craft 
under power may be used only to retrieve dead or crippled birds; 
however, the craft may not be used under power to shoot any crippled 
birds;
    (v) By the use or aid of live birds as decoys; although not limited 
to, it shall be a violation of this paragraph for any person to take 
mid-continent light geese on an area where tame or captive live geese 
are present unless such birds are and have been for a period of 10 
consecutive days before the taking, confined within an enclosure that 
substantially reduces the audibility of their calls and totally conceals 
the birds from the sight of mid-continent light geese;
    (vi) By means or aid of any motor-driven land, water, or air 
conveyance, or any sailboat used for the purpose of or resulting in the 
concentrating, driving, rallying, or stirring up of mid-continent light 
geese;
    (vii) By the aid of baiting, or on or over any baited area. As used 
in this paragraph, ``baiting'' means the placing, exposing, depositing, 
distributing, or scattering of shelled, shucked, or unshucked corn, 
wheat or other grain, salt, or other feed so as to constitute for such 
birds a lure, attraction or enticement to, on, or over any areas where 
hunters are attempting to take them; and ``baited area'' means any area 
where shelled, shucked, or unshucked corn, wheat or other grain, salt, 
or other feed capable of luring, attracting, or enticing such birds is 
directly or indirectly placed, exposed, deposited, distributed, or 
scattered; and such area shall remain a baited area for 10 days 
following complete removal of all such corn, wheat or other grain, salt, 
or other feed. However, nothing in this paragraph prohibits the taking 
of mid-continent light geese on or over standing crops, flooded standing 
crops (including aquatics), flooded harvested croplands, grain crops 
properly shucked on the field where grown, or grains found scattered 
solely as the result of normal agricultural planting or harvesting; or
    (viii) Participants may not possess shot (either in shotshells or as 
loose shot for muzzleloading) other than steel shot, or bismuth-tin, or 
other shots that are authorized in 50 CFR 20.21(j). Season limitations 
in that section do not apply to participants acting under this order.
    (e) Under what conditions would the conservation order be revoked? 
The Service will annually assess the overall impact and effectiveness of 
the conservation order to ensure compatibility with long-term 
conservation of this resource. If at any time we receive that clearly 
demonstrates a serious threat of injury to the area or areas involved no 
longer exists, we will initiate action to revoke the conservation order.
    (f) Will information concerning the conservation order be collected? 
The information collection requirements of the conservation order have 
been approved by OMB and assigned clearance number 1018-0103. Agencies 
may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, 
a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB 
control number. The recordkeeping and reporting requirements imposed 
under regulations established in this subpart E will be utilized to 
administer this program, particularly in the assessment of impacts 
alternative regulatory strategies may have on mid-continent light geese 
and other migratory bird populations. The information collected will be 
required to authorize State and Tribal governments responsible for 
migratory bird management to take mid-continent light geese within the 
guidelines provided by the Service.

<R05>
Sec. 21.61  Population control of resident Canada geese.

    (a) Which Canada geese are covered by this regulation? This 
regulation addresses the population control of resident Canada geese, as 
defined in Sec. 21.3.
    (b) What is the resident Canada goose population control program, 
and what is its purpose? The resident Canada goose population control 
program is a managed take program implemented under the authority of the 
Migratory Bird Treaty Act to reduce and stabilize resident Canada goose 
populations when traditional and otherwise authorized management 
measures are unsuccessful, not feasible for dealing with, or applicable, 
in preventing injury to property, agricultural crops, public health, and 
other interests from resident Canada geese. The Director is authorized 
to allow States and Tribes to implement a population control, or managed 
take, program to remedy these injuries. When authorized by the Director, 
managed take allows additional methods of taking resident Canada geese, 
allows shooting hours for resident Canada geese to extend to one-half 
hour after sunset, and removes daily bag limits for resident Canada 
geese inside or outside the migratory bird hunting season frameworks as 
described in this section. The intent of the program is to reduce 
resident Canada goose populations in order to protect personal property 
and agricultural crops and other interests from injury and to resolve 
potential concerns about human health. The management and control 
activities allowed or conducted under the program are intended to 
relieve or prevent damage and injurious situations. No person should 
construe this program as opening, reopening, or extending any hunting 
season contrary to any regulations established under section 3 of the 
Migratory Bird Treaty Act.
    (c) What areas are eligible to participate in the program? When 
approved by the Director, the State and Tribal wildlife agencies of 
Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, 
Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, 
Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, 
Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North 
Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, 
South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, West 
Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming may implement the resident Canada goose 
population control program components in the Atlantic, Central, and 
Mississippi Flyway portions of these States.
    (d) What is required in order for State governments to participate 
in a managed take program? Following the conclusion of the first full 
operational year of Sec. Sec. 21.49 through 21.52 of this part, any 
wildlife agency from a State listed in 21.61(c) may request approval for 
the population control program. A request must include a discussion of 
the State's or Tribe's efforts to address its injurious situations 
utilizing the methods approved in this rule or a discussion of the 
reasons why the methods authorized by these rules are not feasible for 
dealing with, or applicable to, the injurious situations that require 
further action. Discussions should be detailed and provide the Service 
with a clear understanding of the injuries that continue, why the 
authorized methods utilized have not worked, and why methods not 
utilized could not effectuate resolution of the injuries. A State's 
request for approval may be for an area or areas smaller than the entire 
State. Upon written approval by the Director, any State or Tribal 
government responsible for the management of wildlife and migratory 
birds may, without permit, kill or cause to be killed under its general 
supervision, resident Canada geese under the following conditions:
    (1) Activities conducted under the managed take program may not 
affect endangered or threatened species as designated under the 
Endangered Species Act.
    (2) Control activities may be conducted under this section only 
between August 1 and August 31.
    (3) Control measures employed through this section may be 
implemented only between the hours of one-half hour before sunrise to 
one-half hour after sunset.
    (4) Nothing in the program may limit or initiate management actions 
on

[[Page 104]]

Federal land without concurrence of the Federal agency with 
jurisdiction.
    (5) States and Tribes must designate participants who must operate 
under the conditions of the managed take program.
    (6) States and Tribes must inform participants of the requirements/
conditions of the program that apply.
    (7) States and Tribes must keep annual records of activities carried 
out under the authority of the program. Specifically, information must 
be collected on:
    (i) The number of individuals participating in the program;
    (ii) The number of days individuals participated in the program;
    (iii) The total number of resident Canada geese shot and retrieved 
during the program; and
    (iv) The number of resident Canada geese shot but not retrieved. The 
States and Tribes must submit an annual report summarizing activities 
conducted under the program and an assessment of the continuation of the 
injuries on or before June 1 of each year to the Chief, Division of 
Migratory Bird Management, 4401 North Fairfax Drive, ms-MBSP-4107, 
Arlington, Virginia 22203.
    (e) What is required for individuals to participate in the program? 
Individual participants in State and Tribal programs covered by the 
managed take program must comply with the following requirements:
    (1) Participants must comply with all applicable State and Tribal 
laws or regulations including possession of whatever permit(s) or other 
authorization(s) may be required by the State or Tribal government 
concerned.
    (2) Participants who take resident Canada geese under the program 
may not sell or offer for sale those birds or their plumage, but may 
possess, transport, and otherwise properly use them.
    (3) Participants must permit at all reasonable times, including 
during actual operations, any Service special agent or refuge officer, 
State or Tribal wildlife or deputy wildlife agent, warden, protector, or 
other wildlife law enforcement officer free and unrestricted access over 
the premises on which such operations have been or are being conducted 
and must promptly furnish whatever information an officer requires 
concerning the operation.
    (4) Participants may take resident Canada geese by any method except 
those prohibited as follows:
    (i) With a trap, snare, net, rifle, pistol, swivel gun, shotgun 
larger than 10 gauge, punt gun, battery gun, machine gun, fish hook, 
poison, drug, explosive, or stupefying substance.
    (ii) From or by means, aid, or use of a sinkbox or any other type of 
low-floating device, having a depression affording the person a means of 
concealment beneath the surface of the water.
    (iii) From or by means, aid, or use of any motor vehicle, motor-
driven land conveyance, or aircraft of any kind, except that paraplegic 
persons and persons missing one or both legs may take from any 
stationary motor vehicle or stationary motor-driven land conveyance.
    (iv) From or by means of any motorboat or other craft having a motor 
attached, or any sailboat, unless the motor has been completely shut off 
and the sails furled, and its progress has ceased. A craft under power 
may be used only to retrieve dead or crippled birds; however, the craft 
may not be used under power to shoot any crippled birds.
    (v) By the use or aid of live birds as decoys. No person may take 
resident Canada geese on an area where tame or captive live geese are 
present unless such birds are, and have been for a period of 10 
consecutive days before the taking, confined within an enclosure that 
substantially reduces the audibility of their calls and totally conceals 
the birds from the sight of resident Canada geese.
    (vi) By means or aid of any motor-driven land, water, or air 
conveyance, or any sailboat used for the purpose of or resulting in the 
concentrating, driving, rallying, or stirring up of resident Canada 
geese.
    (vii) By the aid of baiting, or on or over any baited area, where a 
person knows or reasonably should know that the area is or has been 
baited as described in Sec. 20.11(j) and (k) of this part. Resident 
Canada geese may not be taken on or over lands or areas that are baited 
areas, and where grain or

[[Page 105]]

other feed has been distributed or scattered solely as the result of 
manipulation of an agricultural crop or other feed on the land where 
grown, or solely as the result of a normal agricultural operation as 
described in Sec. 20.11(h) and (l) of this part. However, nothing in 
this paragraph prohibits the taking of resident Canada geese on or over 
the following lands or areas that are not otherwise baited areas:
    (A) Standing crops or flooded standing crops (including aquatics); 
standing, flooded, or manipulated natural vegetation; flooded harvested 
croplands; or lands or areas where seeds or grains have been scattered 
solely as the result of a normal agricultural planting, harvesting, 
post-harvest manipulation or normal soil stabilization practice as 
described in Sec. 20.11(g), (i), (l), and (m) of this part;
    (B) From a blind or other place of concealment camouflaged with 
natural vegetation;
    (C) From a blind or other place of concealment camouflaged with 
vegetation from agricultural crops, as long as such camouflaging does 
not result in the exposing, depositing, distributing, or scattering of 
grain or other feed; or
    (D) Standing or flooded standing agricultural crops where grain is 
inadvertently scattered solely as a result of a hunter entering or 
exiting a hunting area, placing decoys, or retrieving downed birds.
    (E) Participants may not possess shot (either in shotshells or as 
loose shot for muzzleloading) other than steel shot, bismuth-tin, 
tungsten-iron, tungsten-polymer, tungsten-matrix, tungsten-nickel iron, 
or other shots that are authorized in Sec. 20.21(j) of this part.
    (f) Under what conditions would we suspend the managed take program? 
Following authorization by the Director, we will annually assess the 
overall impact and effectiveness of the program on resident Canada goose 
populations to ensure compatibility with long-term conservation of this 
resource. If at any time evidence is presented that clearly demonstrates 
that resident Canada geese populations no longer need to be reduced in 
order to allow resolution or prevention of injury to people, property, 
agricultural crops, or other interests, the Director, in writing, will 
suspend the program for the resident Canada goose population in 
question. However, resumption of injuries caused by growth of the 
population and not otherwise addressable by the methods available in 
part 21 may warrant reinstatement of such regulations. A State must 
reapply for approval, including the same information and discussions 
noted in 21.61(d). Depending on the location of the injury or threat or 
injury, the Director, in writing, may suspend or reinstate this 
authorization for one or more resident Canada goose populations, but not 
others.
    (g) What population information is the State or Tribe required to 
collect concerning the resident Canada goose managed take program? 
Participating States and Tribes must provide an annual estimate of the 
breeding population and distribution of resident Canada geese in their 
State. The States and Tribes must submit this estimate on or before 
August 1 of each year, to the Chief, Division of Migratory Bird 
Management, 4401 N. Fairfax Dr., MBSP-4107, Arlington, Virginia 22203.
    (h) What are the general program conditions and restrictions? The 
program is subject to the conditions elsewhere in this section, and, 
unless otherwise specifically authorized, the following conditions:
    (1) Nothing in this section applies to any Federal land within a 
State's or Tribe's boundaries without written permission of the Federal 
agency with jurisdiction.
    (2) States may not undertake any actions under this section if the 
activities adversely affect other migratory birds or species designated 
as endangered or threatened under the authority of the Endangered 
Species Act. Persons operating under this section must immediately 
report the take of any species protected under the Endangered Species 
Act to the Service. Further, to protect certain species from being 
adversely affected by management actions, States must:
    (i) Follow the Federal State Contingency Plan for the whooping

restrictive laws and regulations as regards the use of golden eagles in 
falconry.
    (d) Issuance criteria. The Director shall conduct an investigation 
and shall not issue a permit to possess and transport golden eagles for 
falconry purposes unless he has determined: that such possession and 
transportation is compatible with the preservation of golden eagles; 
that the proposed possession and transportation of golden eagles for 
falconry is not otherwise prohibited by laws and regulations within the 
State where the activity is proposed; and that the applicant is 
qualified to possess and transport golden eagles for falconry purposes. 
In making the latter determination, the Director shall consider, but 
shall not necessarily be limited to, the following:
    (1) The applicant's cumulative falconry experience.

[[Page 113]]

    (2) The applicant's demonstrated ability to handle and care for 
large raptors.
    (3) Information contained in the applicant's letters of reference.
    (e) Tenure of permits. Any permit to possess and transport golden 
eagles for falconry purposes is valid for as long as the holder 
maintains a valid master (or equivalent) class falconry permit or until 
revoked in writing by the Service.
    (f) Permission to trap golden eagles for falconry purposes. 
Applicants desiring to trap golden eagles from the wild for use in 
falconry must request and obtain permission from the Service prior to 
exercising this privilege. The following applies to requests:
    (1) Only golden eagles from a specified depredation area may be 
trapped for falconry purposes.
    (2) Permission to trap golden eagles must be requested in writing 
from the appropriate State Animal Damage Control (ADC) supervisor 
subsequent to issuance of the permit to possess and transport golden 
eagles for falconry purposes.
    (3) Permission to trap will not be granted until the permittee 
suitably demonstrates to the State ADC supervisor or a designated 
project leader his/her qualifications and capabilities to trap golden 
eagles from the wild.
    (4) All such trapping must be conducted under the direct supervision 
of the State ADC supervisor or designated project leader in the 
specified depredation area.
    (5) Any permission to trap golden eagles from the wild pursuant to 
this section shall in no case extend more than 90 days from the date of 
issue.
    (6) Upon issuance of permission to trap in accordance with the above 
conditions, the appropriate special agent in charge will be notified in 
writing by the State ADC supervisor of the individual's name, address, 
location of the specified depredation area and tenure of permission to 
trap golden eagles.

<R05>
Sec. 22.25  What are the requirements concerning permits to take

golden eagle nests?

    The Director may, upon receipt of an application and in accordance 
with the issuance criteria of this section, issue a permit authorizing 
any person to take golden eagle nests during a resource development or 
recovery operation when the nests are inactive, if the taking is 
compatible with the preservation of the area nesting population of 
golden eagles. The information collection requirements contained within 
this section have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget 
under 44 U.S.C. 3507 and assigned clearance number 1018-0022. This 
information is being collected to provide information necessary to 
evaluate permit applications. This information will be used to review 
permit applications and make decisions, according to the criteria 
established in this section for the issuance or denial of such permits. 
The obligation to respond is required to obtain or retain a permit.
    (a) How do I apply for a permit to take golden eagle nests? You must 
submit applications for permits to take golden eagle nests to the 
appropriate Regional Director--Attention: Migratory Bird Permit Office. 
You can find addresses for the appropriate Regional Directors in 50 CFR 
2.2. We will only accept applications if you are engaged in a resource 
development or recovery operation, including the planning and permitting 
stages of an operation. Your application must contain the general 
information and certification required by Sec. 13.12(a) of this chapter 
plus the following additional information:
    (1) A description of the resource development or recovery operation 
in which the applicant is engaged;
    (2) The number of golden eagle nests proposed to be taken;

[[Page 114]]

    (3) A description of the property on which the taking is proposed, 
with reference made to its exact geographic location. An appropriately 
scaled map or plat must be included which delineates the area of the 
resource development or recovery operation and identifies the exact 
location of each golden eagle nest proposed to be taken. The map or plat 
must contain enough detail so that each golden eagle nest proposed to be 
taken can be readily located by the Service.
    (4) For each golden eagle nest proposed to be taken, the applicant 
must calculate the area nesting population of golden eagles and identify 
on an appropriately scaled map or plat the exact location of each golden 
eagle nest used to calculate the area nesting population unless the 
Service has sufficient data to independently calculate the area nesting 
population. The map or plat must contain enough details so that each 
golden eagle nest used to calculate the area nesting population can be 
readily located by the Service.
    (5) A description of each activity to be performed during the 
resource development or recovery operation which involves the taking of 
a golden eagle nest;
    (6) A statement with any supporting documents from ornithologists 
experienced with golden eagles or other qualified persons who have made 
on site inspections and can verify the applicant's calculation of the 
area nesting population;
    (7) The length of time for which the permit is requested, including 
the dates on which the proposed resource development or recovery 
operation is to begin and end;
    (8) A statement indicating the intended disposition of each nest 
proposed to be taken. Applicants should state whether they are willing 
to collect any nest for scientific or educational purposes; and
    (9) A statement indicating any proposed mitigation measures that are 
compatible with the resource development or recovery operation to 
encourage golden eagles to reoccupy the resource development or recovery 
site. Mitigation measures may include reclaiming disturbed land to 
enhance golden eagle nesting and foraging habitat, relocating in 
suitable habitat any inactive golden eagle nest taken, or establishing 
one or more nest sites. If the establishment of one or more nest sites 
is proposed, a description of the materials and methods to be used and 
the exact location of each artificial nest site must be included.
    (b) Additional permit conditions. In addition to the general 
conditions set forth in part 13 of this chapter, permits to take golden 
eagle nests are subject to the following additional conditions:
    (1) Only inactive golden eagle nests may be taken.
    (2) The permittee shall submit a report of activities conducted 
under the permit to the Director within ten (10) days following the 
permit's expiration;
    (3) The permittee shall notify the Director in writing at least 10 
days but not more than 30 days before any golden eagle nest is taken;
    (4) The permittee shall comply with any mitigation measures 
determined by the Director to be feasible and compatible with the 
resource development or recovery operation; and
    (5) Any permit issued before the commencement of a resource 
development or recovery operation is invalid if the activity which 
required a permit is not performed.
    (c) Issuance criteria. The Director shall conduct an investigation 
and not issue a permit to take any golden eagle nest unless such taking 
is compatible with the preservation of the area nesting population of 
golden eagles. In making such determination, the Director shall consider 
the following:
    (1) Whether the applicant can reasonably conduct the resource 
development or recovery operation in a manner that avoids taking any 
golden eagle nest;
    (2) The total number of golden eagle nests proposed to be taken;
    (3) The size of the area nesting population of golden eagles;
    (4) Whether suitable golden eagle nesting and foraging habitat 
unaffected by the resource development or recovery operation is 
available to the area nesting population of golden eagles to accommodate 
any golden eagles displaced by the resource development or recovery 
operation;

[[Page 115]]

    (5) Whether feasible mitigation measures compatible with the 
resource development or recovery operation are available to encourage 
golden eagles to reoccupy the resource development or recovery site. 
Mitigation measures may include reclaiming disturbed land to enhance 
golden eagle nesting and foraging habitat, relocating in suitable 
habitat any golden eagle nest taken, or establishing one or more nest 
sites; and
    (6) Whether the area nesting population is widely dispersed or 
locally concentrated.
    (d) Tenure of permits. The tenure of any permit to take golden eagle 
nests is 2 years from the date of issuance, unless a shorter period of 
time is prescribed on the face of the permit. Permits may be renewed in 
accordance with part 13 of this chapter.

          Subpart D_Depredation Control Orders on Golden Eagles


<R05>
Sec. 22.31  Golden eagle depredations control order on request 

of Governor of a State.

    (a) Whenever the Governor of any State requests permission to take 
golden eagles to seasonally protect domesticated flocks and herds in 
such State, the Director shall make an investigation and if he 
determines that such taking is necessary to and will seasonally protect 
domesticated flocks and herds in such States he shall authorize such 
taking in whatever part or parts of the State and for such periods as he 
determines necessary to protect such interests.
    (b) Requests from the Governor of a State to take golden eagles to 
seasonally protect domesticated flocks and herds must be submitted in 
writing to the Director listing the periods of time during which the 
taking of such birds is recommended, and including a map of the State 
indicating the boundaries of the proposed area of taking. Such requests 
should include a statement of the facts and the source of such facts 
that in the Governor's opinion justifies the request. After a decision 
by the Director, the Governor will be advised in writing concerning the 
request and a notice will be published in the Federal Register.


<R05>
Sec. 22.32  Conditions and limitations on taking under depredation

control order.

    (a) Whenever the taking of golden eagles without a permit is 
authorized for the seasonal protection of livestock, such birds may be 
taken by firearms, traps, or other suitable means except by poison or 
from aircraft.
    (b) Any person exercising any of the privileges granted by this 
subpart D must permit all reasonable times, including during actual 
operations, any Service agent, or other game law enforcement officer 
free and unrestricted access over the premises on which such operations 
have been or are being conducted; and shall furnish promptly to such 
officer whatever information he may require concerning such operations.
    (c) The authority to take golden eagles under a depredations control 
order issued pursuant to this subpart D only authorizes the taking of 
golden eagles when necessary to seasonally protect domesticated flocks 
and herds, and all such birds taken must be reported and turned over to 
a local Bureau Agent.

                         Subpart A_Introduction


<R05>
Sec. 23.1  What are the purposes of these regulations and CITES?

    (a) Treaty. The regulations in this part implement the Convention on 
International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, also 
known as CITES, the Convention, the Treaty, or the Washington 
Convention, TIAS (Treaties and Other International Acts Series) 8249.
    (b) Purpose. The aim of CITES is to regulate international trade in 
wildlife and plants, including parts, products, and derivatives, to 
ensure it is legal and does not threaten the survival of species in the 
wild. Parties, recognize that:
    (1) Wildlife and plants are an irreplaceable part of the natural 
systems of the earth and must be protected for this and future 
generations.
    (2) The value of wildlife and plants is ever-growing from the 
viewpoints of aesthetics, science, culture, recreation, and economics.
    (3) Although countries should be the best protectors of their own 
wildlife and plants, international cooperation is essential to protect 
wildlife and plant species from over-exploitation through international 
trade.
    (4) It is urgent that countries take appropriate measures to prevent 
illegal trade and ensure that any use of wildlife and plants is 
sustainable.
    (c) National legislation. We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
(FWS), implement CITES through the Endangered Species Act (ESA).


<R05>
Sec. 23.2  How do I decide if these regulations apply to my shipment 

or me?

    Answer the following questions to decide if the regulations in this 
part apply to your proposed activity:

------------------------------------------------------------------------


[[Page 118]]


<R05>
Sec. 23.3  What other wildlife and plant regulations may apply?

    (a) You may need to comply with other regulations in this subchapter 
that require a permit or have additional restrictions. Many CITES 
species are also covered by one or more parts of this subchapter or 
title and have additional requirements:
    (1) Part 15 (exotic birds).
    (2) Part 16 (injurious wildlife).
    (3) Parts 17 of this subchapter and 222, 223, and 224 of this title 
(endangered and threatened species).
    (4) Parts 18 of this subchapter and 216 of this title (marine 
mammals).
    (5) Part 20 (migratory bird hunting).
    (6) Part 21 (migratory birds).
    (7) Part 22 (bald and golden eagles).
    (b) If you are applying for a permit, you must comply with the 
general permit procedures in part 13 of this subchapter. Definitions and 
a list of birds protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act can be 
found in part 10 of this subchapter.
    (c) If you are importing (including introduction from the sea), 
exporting, or re-exporting wildlife or plants, you must comply with the 
regulations in part 14 of this subchapter for wildlife or part 24 of 
this subchapter for plants. Activities with plants are also regulated by 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection 
Service (APHIS) and Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and 
Border Protection (CBP), in 7 CFR parts 319, 355, and 356.
    (d) You may also need to comply with other Federal, State, tribal, 
or local requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 23.4  What are Appendices I, II, and III?

    Species are listed by the Parties in one of three Appendices to the 
Treaty (see subpart H of this part), each of which provides a different 
level of protection and is subject to different requirements. Parties 
regulate trade in specimens of Appendix-I, -II, and -III species and 
their parts, products, and derivatives through a system of permits and 
certificates (CITES documents). Such documents enable Parties to monitor 
the effects of the volume and type of trade to ensure trade is legal and 
not detrimental to the survival of the species.
    (a) Appendix I includes species threatened with extinction that are 
or may be affected by trade. Trade in Appendix-I specimens may take 
place only in exceptional circumstances.
    (b) Appendix II includes species that are not presently threatened 
with extinction, but may become so if their trade is not regulated. It 
also includes species that need to be regulated so that trade in certain 
other Appendix-I or -II species may be effectively controlled; these 
species are most commonly listed due to their similarity of appearance 
to other related CITES species.
    (c) Appendix III includes species listed unilaterally by a range 
country to obtain international cooperation in controlling trade.


<R05>
Sec. 23.5  How are the terms used in these regulations defined?

    In addition to the definitions contained in part 10 of this 
subchapter, and unless the context otherwise requires, in this part:
    Affected by trade means that either a species is known to be in 
trade and the trade has or may have a detrimental impact on the status 
of the species, or a species is suspected to be in trade or there is 
demonstrable potential international demand for the species that may be 
detrimental to the survival of the species in the wild.
    Annotation means an official footnote to the listing of a species in 
the CITES Appendices. A reference annotation provides information that 
further explains the listing (such as ``p.e.'' for possibly extinct). A 
substantive annotation is an integral part of a species listing. It 
designates whether the listing includes or excludes a geographically 
separate population, subspecies, species, group of species, or higher 
taxon, and the types of specimens included in or excluded from the 
listing, such as certain parts, products, or derivatives. A substantive 
annotation may designate export quotas adopted by the CoP. For species 
transferred from Appendix I to II subject to an annotation relating to 
specified types of specimens, other types of specimens that are not 
specifically included in

[[Page 119]]

the annotation are treated as if they are Appendix-I specimens.
    Appropriate and acceptable destination, when used in an Appendix-II 
listing annotation for the export of, or international trade in, live 
animals, means that the Management Authority of the importing country 
has certified, based on advice from the Scientific Authority of that 
country, that the proposed recipient is suitably equipped to house and 
care for the animal (see criteria in Sec. 23.65). Such certification 
must be provided before a CITES document is issued by the Management 
Authority of the exporting or re-exporting country.
    Artificially propagated means a cultivated plant that meets the 
criteria in Sec. 23.64.
    ATA carnet means a type of international customs document (see Sec. 
23.50). ATA is a combination of the French and English words ``Admission 
Temporaire/Temporary Admission.''
    Bred for commercial purposes means any specimen of an Appendix-I 
wildlife species bred in captivity for commercial purposes. Any 
Appendix-I specimen that does not meet the definition of ``bred for 
noncommercial purposes'' is considered to be bred for commercial 
purposes.
    Bred for noncommercial purposes means any specimen of an Appendix-I 
wildlife species bred in captivity for noncommercial purposes, where 
each donation, exchange, or loan of the specimen is noncommercial and is 
conducted between facilities that are involved in a cooperative 
conservation program.
    Bred in captivity means wildlife that is captive-bred and meets the 
criteria in Sec. 23.63.
    Captive-bred means wildlife that is the offspring (first (F1) or 
subsequent generations) of parents that either mated or otherwise 
transferred egg and sperm under controlled conditions if reproduction is 
sexual, or of a parent that was maintained under controlled conditions 
when development of the offspring began if reproduction is asexual, but 
does not meet the bred-in-captivity criteria (see Sec. 23.63).
    Certificate means a CITES document or CITES exemption document that 
identifies on its face the type of certificate it is, including re-
export certificate, introduction-from-the-sea certificate, and 
certificate of origin.
    CITES document or CITES exemption document means any certificate, 
permit, or other document issued by a Management Authority of a Party or 
a competent authority of a non-Party whose name and address is on file 
with the Secretariat to authorize the international movement of CITES

Sec. 23.6  What are the roles of the Management and Scientific 

Authorities?

    Under Article IX of the Treaty, each Party must designate a 
Management and Scientific Authority to implement CITES for that country. 
If a non-Party wants to trade with a Party, it must also designate such 
Authorities. The names and addresses of these offices must be sent to 
the Secretariat to be included in the Directory. In the United States, 
different offices within the FWS have been designated the Scientific 
Authority and Management Authority, which for purposes of this section 
includes FWS Law Enforcement. When offices share activities, the 
Management Authority is responsible for dealing primarily with 
management and regulatory issues and the Scientific Authority is 
responsible for dealing primarily with scientific issues. The offices do

    (2) If the foreign country requires you to have a U.S. CITES 
document for these kinds of samples, you must apply for a CITES document 
and meet the requirements of this part.
    (b) Urine and feces. Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this 
section, we consider urine and feces to be wildlife byproducts, rather 
than parts, products, or derivatives, and exempt them from the 
requirements of CITES and this part.

[[Page 126]]

    (c) DNA. We differentiate between DNA directly extracted from blood 
and tissue and DNA synthetically derived as follows:
    (1) A DNA sample directly derived from wildlife or plant tissue is 
regulated by CITES and this part.
    (2) A DNA sample synthetically derived that does not contain any 
part of the original template is exempt from the requirements of CITES 
and this part.

Sec. 23.20  What CITES documents are required for international trade?

    (a) Purpose. Articles III, IV, and V of the Treaty give the types of 
standard CITES documents that must accompany an Appendix-I, -II, or -III 
specimen in international trade. Articles

[[Page 130]]

VII and XIV recognize some exemptions and provide that a CITES document 
must accompany most exempt specimens.
    (b) Stricter national measures. Before importing, introducing from 
the sea, exporting, or re-exporting a specimen, check with the 
Management Authorities of all countries concerned to obtain any 
documentation required under stricter national measures.
    (c) CITES documents. Except as provided in the regulations in this 
part, you must have a valid CITES document to engage in international 
trade in any CITES specimen.
    (d) CITES exemption documents. The following table lists the CITES 
exemption document that you must obtain before conducting a proposed 
activity with an exempt specimen (other than specimens exempted under 
Sec. 23.92). If one of the exemptions does not apply to the specimen, 
you must obtain a CITES document as provided in paragraph (e) of this 
section. The first column in the following table alphabetically lists 
the type of specimen or activity that may qualify for a CITES exemption 
document. The last column indicates the section of this part that 
contains information on the application procedures, provisions, 
criteria, and conditions specific to each CITES exemption document, as 
follows:

    (e) Import permits, export permits, re-export certificates, and 
certificates of origin. Unless one of the exemptions under paragraph (d) 
of this section or Sec. 23.92 applies, you must obtain the following 
CITES documents before conducting the proposed activity:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                  Appendix                                    Type of CITES document(s) required
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I                                             Import permit (Sec.  23.35) and either an export permit (Sec.
                                               23.36) or re-export certificate (Sec.  23.37)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
II                                            Export permit (Sec.  23.36) or re-export certificate (Sec.
                                               23.37)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
III                                           Export permit (Sec.  23.36) if the specimen originated in a
                                               country that listed the species; certificate of origin (Sec.
                                               23.38) if the specimen originated in a country other than the
                                               listing country, unless the listing annotation indicates
                                               otherwise; or re-export certificate for all re-exports (Sec.
                                               23.37)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (f) Introduction-from-the-sea certificates. For introduction from 
the sea of Appendix-I or Appendix-II specimens, you must obtain an 
introduction-from-the-sea certificate before conducting the proposed 
activity, unless the exemption in paragraph (d)(10) of this section 
applies (see Sec. 23.39). The export of a specimen that was previously 
introduced from the sea will be treated as an export (see Sec. 23.36 
for export, Sec. 23.36(e) and Sec. 23.39(e) for export of exempt 
specimens, or Sec. 23.37 for re-export). Although an Appendix-III 
specimen does not require a CITES document to be introduced from the 
sea, the subsequent international trade of the specimen would be 
considered an export. For export of an Appendix-III specimen that was 
introduced from the sea you must obtain an export permit (Sec. 23.36) 
if the export is from the country that listed the species in Appendix 
III, a certificate of origin (Sec. 23.38) if the export is from a 
country other than the listing country, or a re-export certificate for 
all re-exports (Sec. 23.37).


<R05>
Sec. 23.21  What happens if a country enters a reservation for a species?

    (a) Purpose. CITES is not subject to general reservations. Articles 
XV, XVI, and XXIII of the Treaty allow a Party to enter a specific 
reservation on a species listed in Appendix I, II, or III, or on parts, 
products, or derivatives of a species listed in Appendix III.
    (b) General provision. A Party can enter a reservation in one of the 
following ways:
    (1) A Party must provide written notification to the Depositary 
Government (Switzerland) on a specific new or amended listing in the 
Appendices within 90 days after the CoP that adopted the listing, or at 
any time for Appendix-III species.
    (2) A country must provide written notification on a specific 
species listing when the country ratifies, accepts, approves, or accedes 
to CITES.
    (c) Requesting the United States take a reservation. You may submit 
information relevant to the issue of whether the United States should 
take a reservation on a species listing to the U.S. Management 
Authority. The request must be submitted within 30 calendar

[[Page 132]]

days after the last day of the CoP where a new or amended listing of a 
species in Appendix I or II occurs, or at any time for a species (or its 
parts, products, or derivatives) listed in Appendix III.
    (d) Required CITES documents. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) 
of this section, Parties treat a reserving Party as if it were a non-
Party for trade in the species concerned (including parts, products, and 
derivatives, as appropriate). The following table indicates when CITES 
documents must accompany a shipment and which Appendix should appear on 
the face of the document:

 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                    If                                  Then
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) The shipment is between a Party and a   The shipment must be
 reserving Party, or the shipment is from    accompanied by a valid
 a non-Party to a reserving Party and is     CITES document(s) (see Sec.
 in transit through a Party                    23.26) that indicates the
                                             CITES Appendix in which the
                                             species is listed.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) The shipment is from a reserving Party  The shipment must be
 to another reserving Party\1\ or non-       accompanied by a valid
 Party and is in transit through a Party     CITES document(s) (see Sec.
                                               23.26) that indicates the
                                             CITES Appendix in which the
                                             species is listed.\2\
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) The shipment is between a reserving     No CITES document is
 Party and another reserving Party\1\ or     required.\2\
 non-Party and is not in transit through a
 Party
------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Both reserving Parties must have a reservation for the same species,
  and if the species is listed in Appendix III, a reservation for the
  same parts, products, and derivatives.
\2\ CITES recommends that reserving Parties treat Appendix-I species as
  if listed in Appendix II and issue CITES documents based on Appendix-
  II permit criteria (see Sec.  23.36). However, the CITES document
  must show the specimen as listed in Appendix I. If the United States
  entered a reservation, such a CITES document would be required.

    (e) Reservations taken by countries. You may consult the CITES 
website or contact us (see Sec. 23.7) for a list of countries that have 
taken reservations and the species involved.


<R05>
Sec. 23.22  What are the requirements for in-transit shipments?

    (a) Purpose. Article VII(1) of the Treaty allows for a shipment to 
transit an intermediary country that is a Party before reaching its 
final destination without the need for the intermediary Party to issue 
CITES documents. To control any illegal trade, Parties are to inspect, 
to the extent possible under their national legislation, specimens in 
transit through their territory to verify the presence of valid 
documentation. See Sec. 23.50 for in-transit shipment of sample 
collections covered by an ATA carnet.
    (b) Document requirements. An in-transit shipment does not require a 
CITES document from an intermediary country, but must be accompanied by 
all of the following documents:
    (1) Unless the specimen qualifies for an exemption under Sec. 
23.92, a valid original CITES document, or a copy of the valid original 
CITES document, that designates the name of the importer in the country 
of final destination and is issued by the Management Authority of the 
exporting or re-exporting country. A copy of a CITES document is subject 
to verification.
    (2) For shipment of an Appendix-I specimen, a copy of a valid import 
permit that designates the name of the importer in the country of final 
destination, unless the CITES document in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section is a CITES exemption document (see Sec. 23.20(d)).
    (3) Transportation and routing documents that show the shipment has 
been consigned to the same importer and country of final destination as 
designated on the CITES document.
    (c) Shipment requirements. An in-transit shipment, including items 
in an on-board store, must meet the following:
    (1) When in an intermediary country, an in-transit shipment must 
stay only for the time needed to immediately transfer the specimen to 
the mode of transport used to continue to the final destination and 
remain under customs control. Other than during immediate transfer, the 
specimen may not be stored in a duty-free, bonded, or other kind of 
warehouse or a free trade zone.

[[Page 133]]

    (2) At any time during transit, an in-transit shipment must not be 
sold, manipulated, or split unless authorized by the Management 
Authority of the intermediary country for inspection or enforcement 
purposes.
    (d) Reserving Party or non-Party. All the requirements of this 
section apply to shipments to or from a reserving Party or non-Party 
that are being transshipped through a Party. The CITES document must 
treat the specimen as listed in the Appendix as provided in Sec. 
23.21(d).
    (e) Specimen protected by other regulations. Shipment of a specimen 
that is also listed as a migratory bird (part 10 of this subchapter), 
injurious wildlife (part 16 of this subchapter), endangered or 
threatened species (parts 17 of this subchapter and 222-224 of this 
title), marine mammal (parts 18 of this subchapter and 216 of this 
title), or bald or golden eagle (part 22 of this subchapter), and is 
moving through the United States is considered an import, and cannot be 
treated as an in-transit shipment (see Sec. 23.3).


<R05>
Sec. 23.23  What information is required on U.S. and foreign CITES

documents?

    (a) Purpose. Article VI of the Treaty provides standard information 
that must be on a permit and certificate issued under Articles III, IV, 
and V. To identify a false or invalid document, any CITES document, 
including a CITES exemption document issued under Article VII, must 
contain standardized information to allow a Party to verify that the 
specimen being shipped is the one listed on the document and that the 
trade is consistent with the provisions of the Treaty.
    (b) CITES form. A CITES document issued by a Party must be on a form 
printed in one or more of the three working languages of CITES (English, 
Spanish, or French). A CITES document from a non-Party may be in the 
form of a permit or certificate, letter, or any other form that clearly 
indicates the nature of the document and includes the information in 
paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section and the additional 
information in Sec. 23.25.
    (c) Required information. Except for a phytosanitary certificate 
used as a CITES certificate for artificially propagated plants in 
paragraph (f) of this section, or a customs declaration label used to 
identify specimens being moved between registered scientific 
institutions (Sec. 23.48(e)(5)), a CITES document issued by a Party or 
non-Party must contain the information set out in this paragraph (listed 
alphabetically). Specific types of CITES documents must also contain the 
additional information identified in paragraph (e) of this section. A 
CITES document is valid only when it contains the following information:

 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
       Required information                      Description
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Appendix                        The CITES Appendix in which the
                                     species, subspecies, or population
                                     is listed (see Sec.  23.21 when a
                                     Party has taken a reservation on a
                                     listing).
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) Applicant's signature           The applicant's signature if the
                                     CITES document includes a place for
                                     it.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) Bill of lading, air waybill,    As applicable for export or re-
 or flight number                    export: (i) by ocean or air cargo,
                                     the bill of lading or air waybill
                                     number or (ii) in accompanying
                                     baggage, the flight number, as
                                     recorded on the CITES document by
                                     the inspecting official at the

                                     measurement as on the export permit
                                     must be used, except to change to
                                     units that are to be used in the

                                     including the subspecies when
                                     needed to determine the level of
                                     protection of the specimen under
                                     CITES, using standard nomenclature
                                     as it appears in the CITES
                                     Appendices or the references
                                     adopted by the CoP. A list of

                                     Sec.  23.7). A CITES document may
                                     contain higher-taxon names in lieu
                                     of the species name only under one
                                     of the following circumstances:
                                    (i) The CoP has agreed that the use
                                     of a higher-taxon name is
                                     acceptable for use on CITES
                                     documents.
                                    (A) If the genus cannot be readily
                                     determined for coral rock, the
                                     scientific name to be used is the
                                     order Scleractinia.
                                    (B) Live and dead coral must be

including, but not limited to, the following:
    (1) We receive reliable information that indicates the need for 
CITES document verification.
    (2) We have reasonable grounds to believe that a CITES document is

detrimental to the survival of the species or in violation of foreign 
wildlife or plant laws, or any applicable Management or Scientific 
Authority finding has not been made.
    (3) The re-export certificate refers to an export permit that does 
not exist or is not valid.
    (4) We have reasonable grounds to believe that the document is 
fraudulent, contains false information, or has unauthorized changes.

identified as bred in captivity or artificially propagated is a wild 
specimen, was produced from illegally acquired parental stock, or 
otherwise does not qualify for these exemptions.
    (6) The import of a specimen designated as bred in captivity or 
artificially propagated is from a non-Party. For an Appendix-I specimen, 
we must consult with the Secretariat.
    (7) For a retrospectively issued CITES document, both the importing 
and exporting or re-exporting countries' Management Authorities have not 
agreed to the issuance of the document.
    (8) For a replacement CITES document, we need clarification of the

<R05>
Sec. 23.34  What kinds of records may I use to show the origin of 

a specimen when I apply for a U.S. CITES document?

    (a) When you apply for a U.S. CITES document, you will be asked to 
provide information on the origin of the specimen that will be covered 
by the CITES document.
    (1) You need to provide sufficient information for us to determine 
if the issuance criteria in this part are met (see the sections in this 
subpart for each type of CITES document).
    (2) We require less detailed information when the import, 
introduction from the sea, export, or re-export poses a low risk to a 
species in the wild and more detailed information when the proposed 
activity poses greater risk to a species in the wild (see Subpart D of 
this part for factors we consider in making certain findings).

<R05>
Sec. 23.45  What are the requirements for a pre-Convention specimen?

    (a) Purpose. Article VII(2) of the Treaty exempts a pre-Convention 
specimen from standard permitting requirements in Articles III, IV, and 
V of the Treaty when the exporting or re-exporting country is satisfied 
that the specimen was acquired before the provisions of CITES applied to 
it and issues a CITES document to that effect.
    (b) U.S. and foreign general provisions. The following general 
provisions apply to the issuance and acceptance of pre-Convention 
documents:
    (1) Trade in a specimen under the pre-Convention exemption is 
allowed only if the importing country will accept a pre-Convention 
certificate.
    (2) The pre-Convention date is the date the species was first listed 
under CITES regardless of whether the species has subsequently been 
transferred from one Appendix to another.
    (3) For a pre-Convention Appendix-I specimen, no CITES import permit 
is required.
    (4) The pre-Convention exemption does not apply to offspring or cell 
lines of any wildlife or plant born or propagated after the date the 
species was first listed under CITES.
    (c) U.S. application form. Complete Form 3-200-23 (wildlife) or Form 
3-200-32 (plants) and submit it to the U.S. Management Authority.
    (d) Criteria. The criteria in this paragraph (d) apply to the 
issuance and acceptance of U.S. and foreign certificates. When applying 
for a U.S. certificate, you must provide sufficient information for us 
to find that the specimen meets all of the following criteria:
    (1) The specimen was removed from the wild or born or propagated in 
a controlled environment before the date CITES first applied to it, or 
is a product (including a manufactured item) or derivative made from 
such specimen.
    (2) The scientific name of the species is the standard nomenclature 
in the CITES Appendices or the references adopted by the CoP (see Sec. 
23.23).
    (3) Live wildlife or plants will be prepared and shipped so as to 
minimize risk of injury, damage to health, or cruel treatment of the 
specimen.
    (4) For the re-export of a pre-Convention specimen previously 
imported under a CITES document, the wildlife or plant was legally 
imported.


<R05>
Sec. 23.46  What are the requirements for registering a commercial

breeding operation for Appendix-I wildlife and commercially
exporting specimens?

    (a) Purpose. Article VII(4) of the Treaty provides that Appendix-I 
specimens that are bred in captivity for commercial purposes shall be 
deemed to be listed in Appendix II. This means that an Appendix-I 
specimen originating from a commercial breeding operation that is 
registered with the CITES Secretariat may be traded under an export 
permit or re-export certificate based on Appendix-II criteria. The 
specimen is still listed in Appendix I and is not eligible for any 
exemption granted to an Appendix-II species or taxon, including any 
exemption granted by an annotation (see Sec. 23.92).
    (b) U.S. and foreign general provisions. The following provisions 
apply to the registration of U.S. and foreign commercial breeding 
operations for Appendix-I wildlife:
    (1) If the Management Authority is satisfied that the operation in 
its country meets the conditions for registration in paragraph (d) of 
this section, it will send the request to register a breeding operation 
to the Secretariat.
    (2) The Secretariat will verify that the application is complete and 
notify the Parties of the request.

[[Page 154]]

    (3) If any Party objects to or expresses concern about the 
registration within 90 days from the date of the Secretariat's 
notification, the Secretariat will refer the application to the Animals 
Committee. The Committee has 60 days to respond to objections. The 
Secretariat will provide the recommendations of the Committee to the 
Management Authority of the Party that submitted the application and the 
Party that objected to the registration, and will facilitate a dialogue 
for resolution of the identified problems within 60 days.
    (4) If the objection is not withdrawn or the identified problems are 
not resolved, approval of the registration will require a two-thirds 
majority vote by the Parties at the next CoP or by a postal vote.
    (5) If other operations have already been registered for the 
species, the Secretariat may send the request to appropriate experts for 
advice only if significant new information is available or if there are 
other reasons for concern.
    (6) If the Secretariat is not satisfied that the operation meets the 
conditions for registration, it will provide the Management Authority 
that submitted the registration request with a full explanation of the 
reasons for rejection and indicate the specific conditions that must be 
met before the registration can be resubmitted for further 
consideration.
    (7) When the Secretariat is satisfied that the operation meets the 
registration requirements, it will include the operation in its 
register.
    (8) Operations are assigned an identification number and listed in 
the official register. Registration is not final until the Secretariat 
notifies all Parties.
    (9) If a Party believes that a registered operation does not meet 
the bred-in-captivity requirements, it may, after consultation with the 
Secretariat and the Party concerned, propose that the CoP delete the 
operation from the register by a two-thirds vote of the Parties. Once an 
operation has been deleted, it must re-apply and meet the registration 
requirements to be reinstated.
    (10) The Management Authority, in collaboration with the Scientific 
Authority, of a country where any registered operation is located must 
monitor the operation to ensure that it continues to meet the 
registration requirements. The Management Authority will advise the 
Secretariat of any major change in the nature of the operation or in the 
types of products being produced for export, and the Animals Committee 
will review the operation to determine whether it should remain 
registered.
    (11) A Party may unilaterally request the removal of a registered 
operation within its jurisdiction by notifying the Secretariat.
    (12) An Appendix-I specimen may not be imported for purposes of 
establishing or augmenting a commercial breeding operation, unless the 
specimen is pre-Convention (see Sec. 23.45) or was bred at a commercial 
breeding operation that is registered with the CITES Secretariat as 
provided in this section.
    (c) U.S. application to register. Complete Form 3-200-65 and submit 
it to the U.S. Management Authority.
    (d) Criteria. The criteria in this paragraph (d) apply to the 
registration of U.S. and foreign commercial breeding operations for 
Appendix-I wildlife. For your breeding operation to be registered in the 
United States, you must provide sufficient information for us to find 
that your proposed activity meets all of the following criteria:

 contribution to the conservation of the species according to
 the conservation needs of the species.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(8) The operation will be carried out at all stages in a humane  -
 (non-cruel) manner.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (e) Standard conditions of the registration. In addition to the 
conditions in Sec. 23.56, you must meet all of the following 
conditions:
    (1) You must uniquely mark all specimens from the breeding operation 
in the manner proposed at the time of registration. Birds may be marked 
with closed bands, although other methods may be used.
    (2) You may not import Appendix-I specimens for primarily commercial 
purposes (such as to establish a commercial captive-breeding operation) 
except from breeding operations registered for that species.
    (3) You must provide information to the Management Authority each 
year on the year's production and your current breeding stock. You may 
provide the information by mail, fax, or e-mail.
    (4) You must allow our agents to enter the premises at any 
reasonable hour to inspect wildlife held or to inspect, audit, or copy 
applicable records.
    (f) U.S. and foreign general provisions for export of specimens that 
originated in a registered breeding operation. The following provisions 
apply to the issuance and acceptance of export permits for Appendix-I 
specimens bred at an operation registered with the CITES Secretariat:
    (1) An export permit may be issued to the registered operation or to 
persons who have purchased a specimen that originated at the registered 
operation if the specimen has the unique mark applied by the operation. 
If a microchip is used, we may, if necessary, ask the importer, 
exporter, or re-exporter to have equipment on hand to read the microchip 
at the time of import, export, or re-export.
    (2) The export permit, and any subsequent re-export certificate, 
must show the specimen as listed in Appendix I and the source code as 
``D,'' and give the identification number of the registered breeding 
operation where the specimen originated.
    (3) No CITES import permit is required for a qualifying specimen.

<R05>
Sec. 23.47  What are the requirements for export of an Appendix-I plant 

artificially propagated for commercial purposes?

    (a) Purpose. Article VII(4) of the Treaty provides that Appendix-I 
plants artificially propagated for commercial purposes shall be deemed 
to be listed in Appendix II. This means that an Appendix-I specimen 
originating from a commercial nursery that is registered with the CITES 
Secretariat or that meets the requirements of this section may be traded 
under an export permit or re-export certificate based on Appendix-II 
criteria. The specimen is still listed in Appendix I and is not eligible 
for any exemption granted to an Appendix-II species or taxon, including 
any exemption granted by an annotation.
    (b) U.S. and foreign general provisions. The following provisions 
apply to the issuance and acceptance of export permits for Appendix-I 
specimens artificially propagated for commercial purposes:
    (1) An Appendix-I specimen may not be imported for purposes of 
establishing or augmenting a nursery or commercial propagating 
operation, unless the specimen is pre-Convention (see Sec. 23.45) or 
was propagated at a nursery that is registered with the CITES 
Secretariat or a commercial propagating operation that qualifies under 
paragraph (d) of this section, and the CITES document indicates the 
source code as ``D.''
    (2) An export permit may be issued to a CITES-registered nursery, to 
a commercial propagating operation that qualifies under paragraph (d) of 
this section, or to persons who have acquired a specimen that originated 
at such a nursery or operation. No CITES import permit is required for a 
qualifying specimen.
    (3) The export permit, and any subsequent re-export certificate, 
must show the specimen as listed in Appendix I and the source code as 
``D,'' and if from a nursery registered with the Secretariat, give the 
identification number of the registered nursery where the specimen 
originated.
    (c) U.S. application form. Complete Form 3-200-33 or Form 3-200-74 
(for additional single-use permits under a master file or an annual 
export program file). Complete Form 3-200-32 for one-time export. Submit 
the completed form to the U.S. Management Authority.
    (d) Criteria. The criteria in this paragraph (d) apply to the 
issuance and acceptance of U.S. and foreign export permits. When 
applying for a U.S. permit, you must provide sufficient information for 
us to find that your proposed activity meets all of the following 
criteria:

derivatives of wildlife and plants.
    (4) The certificate is not transferable.
    (5) Parties should treat the certificate like a passport for import 
and export or re-export from each country, and should not collect the 
original certificate at the border.
    (6) Parties should check specimens closely to determine that each 
specimen matches the certificate and ensure that each live specimen is 
being transported and cared for in a manner that minimizes the risk of 
injury, damage to health, or cruel treatment of the specimen.
    (7) If offspring are born or a new specimen is acquired while the 
traveling exhibition is in another country, the exhibitor must obtain 
the appropriate CITES document for the export or re-export of the 
specimen from the Management Authority of that country.
    (8) Upon returning home, the exhibitor may apply for a traveling-
exhibition certificate for wildlife born overseas or for wildlife or 
plants acquired overseas.
    (c) U.S. application form. Complete Form 3-200-30 for wildlife and 
Form 3-200-32 for plants, and submit it to the U.S. Management 
Authority.

wildlife

[[Page 159]]

or plant while traveling internationally.
    (6) The wildlife or plant is securely marked or identified in such a 
way that border officials can verify that the certificate and specimen 
correspond. If a microchip is used, we may, if necessary, ask the 
importer, exporter, or re-exporter to have equipment on hand to read the 
microchip at the time of import, export, or re-export.
    (e) U.S. standard conditions. In addition to the conditions in Sec. 
23.56, you must meet all of the following conditions:
    (1) The certificate may be used by you, and you must not transfer or 
assign it to another person or traveling exhibition.
    (2) You must transport the specimen internationally only for 
exhibition, not for breeding, propagating, or activities other than

the document that it is valid only if the shipment is accompanied by a 
valid ATA carnet and that the specimens must not be sold, donated, or 
otherwise transferred while outside the originating country.
    (2) The number of the accompanying ATA carnet must be recorded on 
the CITES document, and if this number is not recorded by the Management 
Authority, it must be entered by a customs or other CITES enforcement 
official responsible for the original endorsement of the CITES document.
    (3) The name and address of the exporter or re-exporter and importer 
must be identical, and the names of the countries to be visited must be 
indicated in block 5 or an equivalent place.
    (4) The date of validity must not be later than that of the ATA 
carnet and the period of validity must not exceed 6 months from the date 
of issuance.
    (5) At each border crossing, Parties must verify the presence of the 
CITES document, but allow it to remain with the shipment, and ensure 
that the ATA carnet is properly endorsed with an authorized stamp and 
signature by a customs official.
    (6) The exporter or re-exporter must return the sample collection to 
the originating country prior to the expiration of the CITES document.

[[Page 160]]

    (7) Parties should check the CITES document and sample collection 
closely at the time of first export or re-export and upon its return to 
ensure that the contents of the sample collection have not been changed.
    (8) For import into and export or re-export from the United States, 
the shipment must comply with the requirements for wildlife in part 14 
of this subchapter and for plants in part 24 of this subchapter and 7 
CFR parts 319, 352, and 355.

Sec. 23.51  What are the requirements for issuing a partially completed

CITES document?

    (a) Purpose. Under Article VIII(3), Parties are to ensure that CITES 
specimens are traded with a minimum of delay.
    (b) U.S. and foreign general provisions. The following provisions 
apply to the issuance and acceptance of partially completed CITES 
documents.
    (1) A Management Authority may issue partially completed CITES 
documents only when:
    (i) The permitted trade will have a negligible impact or no impact 
on the conservation of the species.
    (ii) All provisions of CITES have been met.
    (iii) The specimens are one of the following:
    (A) Biological samples.
    (B) Pre-Convention specimens.
    (C) Specimens that qualify as bred in captivity or artificially 
propagated.
    (D) Appendix-I specimens from registered commercial breeding 
operations.
    (E) Appendix-I plants artificially propagated for commercial 
purposes.
    (F) Other specimens that the Management Authority determines qualify 
for partially completed documents.
    (2) A Management Authority may register applicants for species that 
may be traded under partially completed documents.
    (3) Partially completed CITES documents require the permit holder 
to:
    (i) Enter specific information on the CITES document or its annex as 
conditioned on the face of the CITES document.
    (ii) Enter scientific names on the CITES document only if the 
Management Authority included an inventory of approved species on the 
face of the CITES document or an attached annex.
    (iii) Sign the CITES document, which acts as a certification that 
the information entered is true and accurate.

[[Page 161]]

    (4) CITES documents issued for biological samples may be validated 
at the time of issuance provided that upon export the container is 
labeled with the CITES document number and indicates it contains CITES 
biological samples.
    (c) U.S. application form. Complete the appropriate form for the 
proposed activity (see Sec. Sec. 23.18 through 23.20) and submit it to 
the U.S. Management Authority.

issuance and acceptance of U.S. and foreign CITES documents. When 
applying for a U.S. CITES document, you must provide sufficient 
information for us to find that your proposed activity meets the 
criteria in subpart C for the appropriate CITES document and the 
following criteria:
    (1) The use of partially completed documents benefits both the 
permit holder and the issuing Management Authority.
    (2) The proposed activity will have a negligible impact or no impact 
upon the conservation of the species.
    (e) U.S. standard conditions. In addition to the conditions in Sec. 
23.56 and any standard conditions in this part that apply to the 
specific CITES document, the following conditions must be met:
    (1) You must enter the information specified in block 5, either on 
the face of the CITES document or in an annex to the document.
    (2) You may not alter or enter any information on the face of the 
CITES document or in an annex to the document that is not authorized in 
block 5 or an equivalent place.
    (3) If you are authorized to enter a scientific name, it must be for 
a species authorized in block 5 or an equivalent place, or in an 
attached annex of the CITES document.
    (4) You must sign the CITES document to certify that all information 
entered by you is true and correct.


<R05>
Sec. 23.52  What are the requirements for replacing a lost, damaged,

stolen, or accidentally destroyed CITES document?

    (a) Purpose. A Management Authority may issue a duplicate document, 
either a copy of the original or a re-issued original, when a CITES 
document has been lost, damaged, stolen, or accidentally destroyed. 
These provisions do not apply to a document that has expired or that 
requires amendment. To amend or renew a CITES document, see part 13 of 
this subchapter.
    (b) U.S. and foreign general provisions. The following provisions 
apply to the issuance and acceptance of a replacement CITES document:
    (1) The permittee must notify the issuing Management Authority that 
the document was lost, damaged, stolen, or accidentally destroyed.
    (2) The issuing Management Authority must be satisfied that the 
CITES document was lost, damaged, stolen, or accidentally destroyed.
    (3) The issuing Management Authority should immediately inform the 
Management Authority in the country of destination and, for commercial 
shipments, the Secretariat.
    (4) If the replacement CITES document is a copy, it must indicate 
that it is a ``replacement'' and a ``true copy of the original,'' 
contain a new dated original signature of a person authorized to sign 
CITES documents for the issuing Management Authority, and give the 
reason for replacement.
    (5) If the replacement CITES document is a newly issued original 
document, it must indicate that it is a ``replacement,'' include the 
number and date of issuance of the document being replaced, and give the 
reason for replacement.
    (c) U.S. application procedures. To apply for a replacement CITES 
document, you must do all of the following:
    (1) Complete application Form 3-200-66 and submit it to the U.S. 
Management Authority.
    (2) Consult the list to find the types of information you need to 
provide (more than one circumstance may apply to you):

                    (C) Requests a replacement U.S. CITES document.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (d) Criteria. The criteria in this paragraph (d) apply to the 
issuance and acceptance of U.S and foreign documents. When applying for 
a U.S. replacement document, you must provide sufficient information for 
us to find that your proposed activity meets all of the following 
criteria:
    (1) The circumstances for the lost, damaged, stolen, or accidentally 
destroyed CITES document are reasonable.
    (2) If the shipment has already been made, the wildlife or plant was 
legally exported or re-exported, and the Management Authority of the 
importing country has indicated it will accept the replacement CITES 
document.
    (e) U.S. standard conditions. In addition to the conditions in Sec. 
23.56, the following conditions apply:
    (1) If the original CITES document is found, you must return it to 
the U.S. Management Authority.
    (2) A CITES document issued for a shipment that has already occurred 
does not require validation.
    (f) Validation. For an export or re-export that has not left the 
United States, follow the procedures in Sec. 23.27. If the shipment has 
left the United States and is in a foreign country, submit the 
unvalidated replacement CITES document to the appropriate foreign 
authorities. We will not validate the replacement CITES document for a 
shipment that has already been shipped to a foreign country. We do not 
require validation on replacement documents issued by foreign Management 
Authorities.


<R05>
Sec. 23.53  What are the requirements for obtaining a retrospective

CITES document?

    (a) Purpose. Retrospective CITES documents may be issued and 
accepted in certain limited situations to authorize an export or re-
export after that activity has occurred, but before the shipment is 
cleared for import.
    (b) U.S. and foreign general provisions. The following provisions 
apply to the issuance and acceptance of a retrospective CITES document:
    (1) A retrospective document may not be issued for Appendix-I 
specimens except for certain specimens for personal use as specified in 
paragraph (d)(7) of this section.
    (2) The exporter or re-exporter must notify the Management Authority 
in the exporting or re-exporting country of the irregularities that have 
occurred.
    (3) A retrospective document may be one of the following:
    (i) An amended CITES document where it can be shown that the issuing 
Management Authority made a technical error that was not prompted by the 
applicant.
    (ii) A newly issued CITES document where it can be shown that the 
applicant was misinformed by CITES officials or the circumstances in 
(d)(7) of this section apply and a shipment has occurred without a 
document.

[[Page 163]]

    (4) Retrospective documents can only be issued after consultation 
between the Management Authorities in both the exporting or re-exporting 
country and the importing country, including a thorough investigation of 
circumstances and agreement between them that criteria in paragraph (d) 
of this section have been met.
    (5) The issuing Management Authority must provide all of the 
following information on any retrospective CITES document:
    (i) A statement that it was issued retrospectively.
    (ii) A statement specifying the reason for the issuance.
    (iii) In the case of a document issued for personal use, a condition 
restricting sale of the specimen within 6 months following the import of 
the specimen.
    (6) The issuing Management Authority must send a copy of the 
retrospective CITES document to the Secretariat.
    (7) In general, except when the exporter or re-exporter and importer 
have demonstrated they were not responsible for the irregularities, any 
person who has been issued a CITES document in the past will not be 
eligible to receive a retrospective document.
    (c) U.S. application. Complete application Form 3-200-58 and submit 
it to the U.S. Management Authority. In addition, submit one of the 
following:
    (1) For a shipment that occurred under a document containing a 
technical error, the faulty CITES document.
    (2) For a shipment that occurred without a CITES document, a 
completed application form for the type of activity you conducted (see 
Sec. Sec. 23.18 through 23.20).
    (d) Criteria. The criteria in this paragraph (d) apply to the 
issuance and acceptance of U.S. and foreign documents. When applying for 
a U.S. document, you must provide sufficient information for us to find 
that your activity meets all of the following criteria:
    (1) The specimens were exported or re-exported without a CITES 
document or with a CITES document that contained technical errors as 
provided in paragraph (d)(6)(ii) of this section.
    (2) The specimens were presented to the appropriate official for 
inspection at the time of import and a request for a retrospective CITES 
document was made at that time.
    (3) The export or re-export and import of the specimens was 
otherwise in compliance with CITES and the relevant national legislation 
of the countries involved.
    (4) The importing Management Authority has agreed to accept the 
retrospectively issued CITES document.
    (5) The specimens must be Appendix-II or -III wildlife or plants, 
except as provided in paragraph (d)(7) of this section.
    (6) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(7) of this section, the 
exporter or re-exporter and importer were not responsible for the 
irregularities that occurred and have demonstrated one of the following:
    (i) The Management Authority or officials designated to clear CITES 
shipments misinformed the exporter or re-exporter or the importer about 
the CITES requirements. In the United States, this would be an employee 
of the FWS (for any species) or APHIS or CBP (for plants).
    (ii) The Management Authority unintentionally made a technical error 
that was not prompted by information provided by the applicant when 
issuing the CITES document.
    (7) In the case of specimens for personal use, you must either show 
that you qualify under paragraph (d)(6) of this section, or that a 
genuine error was made and that there was no attempt to deceive. The 
following specimens for personal use may qualify for issuance of a 
retrospective document:
    (i) Personal or household effects.
    (ii) Live Appendix-II or -III specimens or live pre-Convention 
Appendix-I specimens that you own for your personal use, accompanied 
you, and number no more than two.
    (iii) Parts, products, or derivatives of an Appendix-I species that 
qualify as pre-Convention when the following conditions are met:
    (A) You own and possess the specimen for personal use.

[[Page 164]]

    (B) You either wore the specimen as clothing or an accessory or took 
it as part of your personal baggage, which was carried by you or checked 
as baggage on the same plane, boat, car, or train as you.
    (C) The quantity is reasonably necessary or appropriate for the 
nature of your trip or stay.
    (e) U.S. standard conditions. In addition to the conditions in Sec. 
23.56, the following condition applies: A CITES document issued for a 
shipment that has already occurred does not require validation.
    (f) Validation. Submit the original unvalidated retrospective CITES 
document to the appropriate foreign authority. We will not validate the 
retrospective CITES document for a shipment that has already been 
shipped to a foreign country, and we do not require validation on 
retrospective documents issued by foreign Management Authorities.


<R05>
Sec. 23.54  How long is a U.S. or foreign CITES document valid?

    (a) Purpose. Article VI(2) of the Treaty sets the time period within 
which an export permit is valid. Validity periods for other CITES 
documents are prescribed in this section.
    (b) Period of validity. CITES documents are valid only if presented 
for import or introduction from the sea within the period of validity 
(before midnight on the expiration date) noted on the face of the 
document.
    (1) An export permit and re-export certificate will be valid for no 
longer than 6 months from the issuance date.
    (2) An import permit, introduction-from-the-sea certificate, and 
certificate of origin will be valid for no longer than 12 months from 
the issuance date.
    (3) A traveling-exhibition certificate and certificate of ownership 
will be valid for no longer than 3 years from the issuance date.
    (4) Other CITES documents will state the period of their validity, 
but no U.S. CITES document will be valid for longer than 3 years from 
the issuance date.
    (c) Extension of validity. The validity of a CITES document may not 
be extended beyond the expiration date on the face of the document, 
except under limited circumstances for certain timber species as 
outlined in Sec. 23.73.


<R05>
Sec. 23.55  How may I use a CITES specimen after import into the 

United States?

    You may use CITES specimens after import into the United States for 
the following purposes:

 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
        If the species is listed in           Allowed use after import
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(a) Appendix I, except for specimens        The specimen may be used,

[[Page 165]]


<R05>
Sec. 23.56  What U.S. CITES document conditions do I need to follow?

    (a) General conditions. The following general conditions apply to 
all U.S. CITES documents:
    (1) You must comply with the provisions of part 13 of this 
subchapter as conditions of the document, as well as other applicable 
regulations in this subchapter, including, but not limited to, any that 
require permits. You must comply with all applicable local, State, 
Federal, tribal, and foreign wildlife or plant conservation laws.
    (2) For export and re-export of live wildlife and plants, transport 
conditions must comply with CITES'Guidelines for transport and 
preparation for shipment of live wild animals and plantsor, in the case 
of air transport of live wildlife, with International Air Transport 
Association Live Animals Regulations.
    (3) You must return the original CITES document to the issuing 
office if you do not use it, it expires, or you request renewal or 
amendment.
    (4) When appropriate, a Management Authority may require that you 
identify Appendix-II and -III wildlife or plants with a mark. All live 
Appendix-I wildlife must be securely marked or uniquely identified. Such 
mark or identification must be made in a way that the border official 
can verify that the specimen and CITES document correspond. If a 
microchip is used, we may, if necessary, ask the importer, exporter, or 
re-exporter to have equipment on hand to read the microchip at the time 
of import, export, or re-export.
    (b) Standard conditions. You must comply with the standard 
conditions provided in this part for specific types of CITES documents.
    (c) Special conditions. We may place special conditions on a CITES 
document based on the needs of the species or the proposed activity. You 
must comply with any special conditions contained in or attached to a 
CITES document.


<R04>
         Subpart D_Factors Considered in Making Certain Findings


<R05>
Sec. 23.60  What factors are considered in making a legal acquisition

finding?

    (a) Purpose. Articles III, IV, and V of the Treaty require a 
Management Authority to make a legal acquisition finding before issuing 
export permits and re-export certificates. The Parties have agreed that 
a legal acquisition finding must also be made before issuing certain 
CITES exemption documents.
    (b) Types of legal acquisition. Legal acquisition refers to whether 
the specimen and its parental stock were:
    (1) Obtained in accordance with the provisions of national laws for 
the protection of wildlife and plants. In the United States, these laws 
include all applicable local, State, Federal, tribal, and foreign laws; 
and
    (2) If previously traded, traded internationally in accordance with 
the provisions of CITES.
    (c) How we make our findings. We make a finding that a specimen was 
legally acquired in the following way:
    (1) The applicant must provide sufficient information (see Sec. 
23.34) for us to make a legal acquisition finding.
    (2) We make this finding after considering all available 
information.
    (3) The amount of information we need to make the finding is based 
on our review of general factors described in paragraph (d) of this 
section and additional specific factors described in paragraphs (e) 
through (k) of this section.
    (4) As necessary, we consult with foreign Management and Scientific 
Authorities, the CITES Secretariat, State conservation agencies, Tribes, 
FWS Law Enforcement, APHIS or CBP, and other appropriate experts.
    (d) Risk assessment. We review the general factors listed in this 
paragraph and additional specific factors in paragraphs (e) through (k) 
of this section to assess the level of scrutiny and amount of 
information we need to make a finding of legal acquisition. We give less 
scrutiny and require less-detailed information when there is a low risk 
that specimens to be exported or re-exported were not legally acquired, 
and give more scrutiny and require more

[[Page 166]]

detailed information when the proposed activity poses greater risk. We 
consider the cumulative risks, recognizing that each aspect of the 
international trade has a continuum of risk from high to low associated 
with it as follows:
    (1) Status of the species: From Appendix I to Appendix III.
    (2) Origin of the specimen: From wild-collected to born or 
propagated in a controlled environment to bred in captivity or 
artificially propagated.
    (3) Source of the propagule used to grow the plant: From 
documentation that the plant was grown from a non-exempt seed or 
seedling to documentation that the plant was grown from an exempt seed 
or seedling.
    (4) Origin of the species: From species native to the United States 
or its bordering countries of Mexico or Canada to nonnative species from 
other countries.
    (5) Volume of illegal trade: From high to low occurrence of illegal 
trade.
    (6) Type of trade: From commercial to noncommercial.
    (7) Trade by range countries: From range countries that do not allow 
commercial export, or allow only limited noncommercial export of the 
species, to range countries that allow commercial export in high 
volumes.
    (8) Occurrence of the species in a controlled environment in the 
United States: From uncommon to common in a controlled environment in 
the United States.
    (9) Ability of the species to be bred or propagated readily in a 
controlled environment: From no documentation that the species can be 
bred or propagated readily in a controlled environment to widely 
accepted information that the species is commonly bred or propagated.
    (10) Genetic status of the specimen: From a purebred species to a 
hybrid.
    (e) Captive-bred wildlife or a cultivated plant. For a specimen that 
is captive-bred or cultivated, we may consider whether the parental 
stock was legally acquired.
    (f) Confiscated specimen. For a confiscated Appendix-II or -III 
specimen, we consider whether information shows that the transfer of the 
confiscated specimen or its offspring met the conditions of the 
remission decision, legal settlement, or disposal action after 
forfeiture or abandonment.
    (g) Donated specimen of unknown origin. For an unsolicited specimen 
of unknown origin donated to a public institution (see Sec. 10.12 of 
this subchapter), we consider whether:
    (1) The public institution follows standard recordkeeping practices 
and has made reasonable efforts to obtain supporting information on the 
origin of the specimen.
    (2) The public institution provides sufficient information to show 
it made a reasonable effort to find a suitable recipient in the United 
States.
    (3) The export will provide a conservation benefit to the species.
    (4) No persuasive information exists on illegal transactions 
involving the specimen.
    (5) The export is noncommercial, with no money or barter exchanged 
except for shipping costs.
    (6) The institution has no history of receiving a series of rare and 
valuable specimens or a large quantity of wildlife or plants of unknown 
origin.
    (h) Imported previously. For a specimen that was previously imported 
into the United States, we consider any reliable, relevant information 
we receive concerning the validity of a CITES document, regardless of 
whether the shipment was cleared by FWS, APHIS, or CBP.
    (i) Personal use. For a wildlife or plant specimen that is being 
exported or re-exported for personal use by the applicant, we consider 
whether:
    (1) The specimen was acquired in the United States and possessed for 
strictly personal use.
    (2) The number of specimens is reasonably appropriate for the nature 
of your export or re-export as personal use.
    (3) No persuasive evidence exists on illegal transactions involving 
the specimen.
    (j) Sequential ownership. For a specimen that was previously 
possessed by someone other than the applicant, we may consider the 
history of ownership for a specimen and its parental stock, breeding 
stock, or cultivated parental stock.

[[Page 167]]

    (k) Wild-collected in the United States. For a specimen collected 
from the wild in the United States, we consider the site where the 
specimen was collected, whether the species is known to occur at that 
site, the abundance of the species at that site, and, if necessary, 
whether permission of the appropriate management agency or landowner was 
obtained to collect the specimen.


<R05>
Sec. 23.61  What factors are considered in making a non-detriment finding?

    (a) Purpose. Articles III and IV of the Treaty require that, before 
we issue a CITES document, we find that a proposed export or 
introduction from the sea of Appendix-I or -II specimens is not 
detrimental to the survival of the species and that a proposed import of 
an Appendix-I specimen is for purposes that would not be detrimental to 
the survival of the species.
    (b) Types of detriment. Detrimental activities, depending on the 
species, could include, among other things, unsustainable use and any 
activities that would pose a net harm to the status of the species in 
the wild. For Appendix-I species, it also includes use or removal from 
the wild that results in habitat loss or destruction, interference with 
recovery efforts for a species, or stimulation of further trade.
    (c) General factors. The applicant must provide sufficient 
information for us to make a finding of non-detriment. In addition to 
factors in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, we will consider 
whether:
    (1) Biological and management information demonstrates that the 
proposed activity represents sustainable use.
    (2) The removal of the animal or plant from the wild is part of a 
biologically based sustainable-use management plan that is designed to 
eliminate over-utilization of the species.
    (3) If no sustainable-use management plan has been established, the 
removal of the animal or plant from the wild would not contribute to the 
over-utilization of the species, considering both domestic and 
international uses.
    (4) The proposed activity, including the methods used to acquire the 
specimen, would pose no net harm to the status of the species in the 
wild.
    (5) The proposed activity would not lead to long-term declines that 
would place the viability of the affected population in question.
    (6) The proposed activity would not lead to significant habitat or 
range loss or restriction.
    (d) Additional factor for Appendix-II species. In addition to the 
general factors in paragraph (c) of this section, we will consider 
whether the intended export of an Appendix-II species would cause a 
significant risk that the species would qualify for inclusion in 
Appendix I.
    (e) Additional factors for Appendix-I species. In addition to the 
general factors in paragraph (c) of this section, we will consider 
whether the proposed activity:
    (1) Would not cause an increased risk of extinction for either the 
species as a whole or the population from which the specimen was 
obtained.
    (2) Would not interfere with the recovery of the species.
    (3) Would not stimulate additional trade in the species. If the 
proposed activity does stimulate trade, we will consider whether the 
anticipated increase in trade would lead to the decline of the species.
    (f) How we make our findings. We base the non-detriment finding on 
the best available biological information. We also consider trade 
information, including trade demand, and other scientific management 
information. We make a non-detriment finding in the following way:
    (1) We consult with the States, Tribes, other Federal agencies, 
scientists, other experts, and the range countries of the species.
    (2) We consult with the Secretariat and other Parties to monitor the 
level of trade that is occurring in the species.
    (3) Based on the factors in paragraphs (c) through (e) of this 
section, we evaluate the biological impact of the proposed activity.
    (4) In cases where insufficient information is available or the 
factors above are not satisfactorily addressed, we take precautionary 
measures and would be unable to make the required finding of non-
detriment.

[[Page 168]]

    (g) Risk assessment. We review the status of the species in the wild 
and the degree of risk the proposed activity poses to the species to 
determine the level of scrutiny needed to make a finding. We give 
greater scrutiny and require more detailed information for activities 
that pose a greater risk to a species in the wild. We consider the 
cumulative risks, recognizing that each aspect of international trade 
has a continuum of risk (from high to low) associated with it as 
follows:
    (1) Status of the species: From Appendix I to Appendix II.
    (2) Origin of the specimen: From wild-collected to born or 
propagated in a controlled environment to bred in captivity or 
artificially propagated.
    (3) Source of the propagule used to grow the plant: From 
documentation that the plant was grown from a non-exempt seed or 
seedling to documentation that the plant was grown from an exempt seed 
or seedling.
    (4) Origin of the species: From native species to nonnative species.
    (5) Volume of legal trade: From high to low occurrence of legal 
trade.
    (6) Volume of illegal trade: From high to low occurrence of illegal 
trade.
    (7) Type of trade: From commercial to noncommercial.
    (8) Genetic status of the specimen: From a purebred species to a 
hybrid.
    (9) Risk of disease transmission: From high to limited risk of 
disease transmission.
    (10) Basis for listing: From listed under Article II(1) or II(2)(a) 
of the Treaty to listed under Article II(2)(b).
    (h) Quotas for Appendix-I species. When an export quota has been set 
by the CoP for an Appendix-I species, we will consider the scientific 
and management basis of the quota together with the best available 
biological information when we make our non-detriment finding. We will 
contact the Scientific and Management Authorities of the exporting 
country for further information if needed.

Sec. 23.62  What factors are considered in making a finding of not 

for primarily commercial purposes?

    (a) Purpose. Under Article III(3(c)) and (5(c)) of the Treaty, an 
import permit or an introduction-from-the-sea certificate for Appendix-I 
species can be issued only if the Management Authority is satisfied that 
the specimen is not to be used for primarily commercial purposes. Trade 
in Appendix-I species must be subject to particularly strict regulation 
and authorized only in exceptional circumstances.
    (b) How we make our findings. We must find that the intended use of 
the Appendix-I specimen is not for primarily commercial purposes before 
we can issue a CITES document.
    (1) We will make this decision on a case-by-case basis considering 
all available information.
    (2) The applicant must provide sufficient information to satisfy us 
that the intended use is not for primarily commercial purposes.
    (3) The definitions of ``commercial'' and ``primarily commercial 
purposes'' in Sec. 23.5 apply.
    (4) We will look at all aspects of the intended use of the specimen. 
If the noncommercial aspects do not clearly predominate, we will 
consider the import or introduction from the sea to be for primarily 
commercial purposes.
    (5) While the nature of the transaction between the owner in the 
country of export and the recipient in the country of import or 
introduction from the sea may have some commercial aspects, such as the 
exchange of money to cover the costs of shipment and care of specimens 
during transport, it is the intended use of the specimen, including the 
purpose of the export, that must not be for primarily commercial 
purposes.
    (6) We will conduct an assessment of factors listed in paragraph (d) 
of this section. For activities involving an anticipated measurable 
increase in revenue and other economic value associated with the 
intended use, we will conduct an analysis as described in paragraph (e) 
of this section.
    (7) All net profits generated in the United States from activities 
associated with the import of an Appendix-I species must be used for 
conservation of that species.
    (c) Examples. The following are examples of types of transactions in 
which the noncommercial aspects of the intended use of the specimen may 
predominate depending on the facts of

[[Page 169]]

each situation. The discussions of each example provide further guidance 
in assessing the actual degree of commerciality on a case-by-case basis. 
These examples outline circumstances commonly encountered and do not 
cover all situations where import or introduction from the sea could be 
found to be not for primarily commercial purposes.
    (1) Personal use. Import or introduction from the sea of an 
Appendix-I specimen for personal use generally is considered to be not 
for primarily commercial purposes. An example is the import of a 
personal sport-hunted trophy by the person who hunted the wildlife for 
display in his or her own home.
    (2) Scientific purposes. The import or introduction from the sea of 
an Appendix-I specimen by a scientist or scientific institution may be 
permitted in situations where resale, commercial exchange, or exhibit of 
the specimen for economic benefit is not the primary intended use.
    (3) Conservation, education, or training. Generally an Appendix-I 
specimen may be imported or introduced from the sea by government 
agencies or nonprofit institutions for purposes of conservation, 
education, or training. For example, a specimen could be imported or 
introduced from the sea primarily to train customs staff in effective 
CITES control, such as for identification of certain types of specimens.
    (4) Biomedical industry. Import or introduction from the sea of an 
Appendix-I specimen by an institution or company in the biomedical 
industry is initially presumed to be commercial since specimens are 
typically imported or introduced from the sea to develop and sell 
products that promote public health for profit. However, if the importer 
clearly shows that the sale of products is only incidental to public 
health research and not for the primary purpose of economic benefit or 
profit, then such an import or introduction from the sea could be 
considered as scientific research under paragraph (c)(2) of this section 
if the principles of paragraph (b) of this section are met.
    (5) Captive-breeding or artificial propagation programs. The import 
of an Appendix-I specimen for purposes of establishing a commercial 
operation for breeding or artificial propagation is considered to be for 
primarily commercial purposes. As a general rule, import or introduction 
from the sea of an Appendix-I specimen for a captive-breeding or 
artificial propagation program must have as a priority the long-term 
protection and recovery of the species in the wild. The captive-breeding 
or artificial propagation program must be part of a program aimed at the 
recovery of the species in the wild and be undertaken with the support 
of a country within the species' native range. Any profit gained must be 
used to support this recovery program. If a captive-breeding or 
artificial propagation operation plans to sell surplus specimens to help 
offset the costs of its program, import or introduction from the sea 
would be allowed only if any profit would be used to support the 
captive-breeding or artificial propagation program to the benefit of the 
Appendix-I species, not for the personal economic benefit of a private 
individual or share-holder.
    (6) Professional dealers. Import or introduction from the sea by a 
professional dealer who states a general intention to eventually sell 
the specimen or its offspring to an undetermined recipient would be 
considered to be for primarily commercial purposes. However, import or 
introduction from the sea through a professional dealer by a qualified 
applicant may be acceptable if the ultimate intended use would be for 
one of the purposes set out in paragraphs (c)(2), (3), and (5) of this 
section and where a binding contract, conditioned on the issuing of 
permits, is in place.
    (d) Risk assessment. We review the factors listed in this paragraph 
(d) to assess the level of scrutiny and amount of information we need to 
make a finding of whether the intended use of the specimen is not for 
primarily commercial purposes. We give less scrutiny and require less 
detailed information when the import or introduction from the sea poses 
a low risk of being primarily commercial, and give more scrutiny and 
require more detailed information when the proposed activity poses 
greater risk. We consider the cumulative risks, recognizing that each 
aspect of

[[Page 170]]

the international trade has a continuum of risk from high to low 
associated with it as follows:
    (1) Type of importer: From for-profit entity to private individual 
to nonprofit entity.
    (2) Ability of the proposed uses to generate revenue: From the 
ability to generate measurable increases in revenue or other economic 
value to no anticipated increases in revenue or other economic value.
    (3) Appeal of the species: From high public appeal to low public 
appeal.
    (4) Occurrence of the species in the United States: From uncommon to 
common in a controlled environment in the United States.
    (5) Intended use of offspring: From commercial to noncommercial.
    (e) Analysis of anticipated revenues and other economic value. We 
will analyze revenues and other economic value anticipated to result 
from the use of the specimen for activities with a high risk of being 
primarily commercial.
    (1) We will examine the proposed use of any net profits generated in 
the United States. We consider net profit to include all funds or other 
valuable considerations (including enhanced value of common stock 
shares) received or attained by you or those affiliated with you as a 
result of the import or introduction from the sea, to the extent that 
such funds or other valuable considerations exceed the reasonable 
expenses that are properly attributable to the proposed activity.
    (2) We will consider any conservation project to be funded and, if 
the species was or is to be taken from the wild, how the project 
benefits the species in its native range, including agreements, 
timeframes for accomplishing tasks, and anticipated benefits to the 
species.
    (3) We will consider any plans to monitor a proposed conservation 
project, including expenditure of funds or completion of tasks.
    (4) In rare cases involving unusually high net profits, we will 
require the applicant to provide a detailed analysis of expected revenue 
(both direct and indirect) and expenses to show anticipated net profit, 
and a statement from a licensed, independent certified public accountant 
that the internal accounting system is sufficient to account for and 
track funds generated by the proposed activities.


<R05>
Sec. 23.63  What factors are considered in making a finding that an

animal is bred in captivity?

    (a) Purpose. Article VII(4) and (5) of the Treaty provide exemptions 
that allow for the special treatment of wildlife that was bred in 
captivity (see Sec. Sec. 23.41 and 23.46).
    (b) Definitions. The following terms apply when determining whether 
specimens qualify as ``bred in captivity'':
    (1) A controlled environment means one that is actively manipulated 
for the purpose of producing specimens of a particular species; that has 
boundaries designed to prevent specimens, including eggs or gametes, 
from entering or leaving the controlled environment; and has general 
characteristics that may include artificial housing, waste removal, 
provision of veterinary care, protection from predators, and 
artificially supplied food.
    (2) Breeding stock means an ensemble of captive wildlife used for 
reproduction.
    (c) Bred-in-captivity criteria. For a specimen to qualify as bred in 
captivity, we must be satisfied that all the following criteria are met:
    (1) If reproduction is sexual, the specimen was born to parents that 
either mated or transferred gametes in a controlled environment.
    (2) If reproduction is asexual, the parent was in a controlled 
environment when development of the offspring began.
    (3) The breeding stock meets all of the following criteria:
    (i) Was established in accordance with the provisions of CITES and 
relevant national laws.
    (ii) Was established in a manner not detrimental to the survival of 
the species in the wild.
    (iii) Is maintained with only occasional introduction of wild 
specimens as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (iv) Has consistently produced offspring of second or subsequent 
generations in a controlled environment, or is

[[Page 171]]

managed in a way that has been demonstrated to be capable of reliably 
producing second-generation offspring and has produced first-generation 
offspring.
    (d) Addition of wild specimens. A very limited number of wild 
specimens (including eggs or gametes) may be introduced into a breeding 
stock if all of the following conditions are met (for Appendix-I 
specimens see also Sec. 23.46(b)(12)):
    (1) The specimens were acquired in accordance with the provisions of 
CITES and relevant national laws.
    (2) The specimens were acquired in a manner not detrimental to the 
survival of the species in the wild.
    (3) The specimens were added either to prevent or alleviate 
deleterious inbreeding, with the number of specimens added as determined 
by the need for new genetic material, or to dispose of confiscated 
animals.


<R05>
Sec. 23.64  What factors are considered in making a finding that a

plant is artificially propagated?

    (a) Purpose. Article VII(4) and (5) of the Treaty provide exemptions 
that allow for special treatment of plants that were artificially 
propagated (see Sec. Sec. 23.40 and 23.47).
    (b) Definitions. The following terms apply when determining whether 
specimens qualify as ``artificially propagated'':
    (1) Controlled conditions means a nonnatural environment that is 
intensively manipulated by human intervention for the purpose of plant 
production. General characteristics of controlled conditions may 
include, but are not limited to, tillage, fertilization, weed and pest 
control, irrigation, or nursery operations such as potting, bedding, or 
protection from weather.
    (2) Cultivated parental stock means the ensemble of plants grown 
under controlled conditions that are used for reproduction.
    (c) Artificially propagated criteria. Except as provided in 
paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, for a plant specimen to qualify 
as artificially propagated, we must be satisfied that the plant specimen 
was grown under controlled conditions from a seed, cutting, division, 
callus tissue, other plant tissue, spore, or other propagule that either 
is exempt from the provisions of CITES or has been derived from 
cultivated parental stock. The cultivated parental stock must meet all 
of the following criteria:
    (1) Was established in accordance with the provisions of CITES and 
relevant national laws.
    (2) Was established in a manner not detrimental to the survival of 
the species in the wild.
    (3) Is maintained in sufficient quantities for propagation so as to 
minimize or eliminate the need for augmentation from the wild, with such 
augmentation occurring only as an exception and limited to the amount 
necessary to maintain the vigor and productivity of the cultivated 
parental stock.
    (d) Cutting or division. A plant grown from a cutting or division is 
considered to be artificially propagated only if the traded specimen 
does not contain any material collected from the wild.
    (e) Grafted plant. A grafted plant is artificially propagated only 
when both the rootstock and the material grafted to it have been taken 
from specimens that were artificially propagated in accordance with 
paragraph (c) of this section. A grafted specimen that consists of taxa 
from different Appendices is treated as a specimen of the taxon listed 
in the more restrictive Appendix.
    (f) Timber. Timber taken from trees planted and grown in a 
monospecific plantation is considered artificially propagated if the 
seeds or other propagules from which the trees are grown were legally 
acquired and obtained in a non-detrimental manner.
    (g) Exception for certain plant specimens grown from wild-collected 
seeds or spores. Plant specimens grown from wild-collected seeds or 
spores may be considered artificially propagated only when all of the 
following conditions have been met:
    (1) Establishment of a cultivated parental stock for the taxon 
presents significant difficulties because specimens take a long time to 
reach reproductive age.
    (2) The seeds or spores are collected from the wild and grown under 
controlled conditions within a range country, which must also be the 
country of origin of the seeds or spores.

[[Page 172]]

    (3) The Management Authority of the range country has determined 
that the collection of seeds or spores was legal and consistent with 
relevant national laws for the protection and conservation of the 
species.
    (4) The Scientific Authority of the range country has determined 
that collection of the seeds or spores was not detrimental to the 
survival of the species in the wild, and allowing trade in such 
specimens has a positive effect on the conservation of wild populations. 
In making these determinations, all of the following conditions must be 
met:
    (i) The collection of seeds or spores for this purpose must be 
limited in such a manner as to allow regeneration of the wild 
population.
    (ii) A portion of the plants produced must be used to establish 
plantations to serve as cultivated parental stock in the future and 
become an additional source of seeds or spores and thus reduce or 
eliminate the need to collect seeds from the wild.
    (iii) A portion of the plants produced must be used for replanting 
in the wild, to enhance recovery of existing populations or to re-
establish populations that have been extirpated.
    (5) Operations propagating Appendix-I species for commercial 
purposes must be registered with the CITES Secretariat in accordance 
with the Guidelines for the registration of nurseries exporting 
artificially propagated specimens of Appendix-I species.


<R05>
Sec. 23.65  What factors are considered in making a finding that an

applicant is suitably equipped to house and care for a live specimen?

    (a) Purpose. Under Article III(3)(b) and (5)(b) of the Treaty, an 
import permit or introduction-from-the-sea certificate for live 
Appendix-I specimens can be issued only if we are satisfied that the 
recipients are suitably equipped to house and care for them.
    (b) General principles. We will follow these general principles in 
making a decision on whether an applicant has facilities that would 
provide proper housing to maintain the specimens for the intended 
purpose and the expertise to provide proper care and husbandry or 
horticultural practices.
    (1) All persons who would be receiving a specimen must be identified 
in an application and their facilities approved by us, including persons 
who are likely to receive a specimen within 1 year after it arrives in 
the United States.
    (2) The applicant must provide sufficient information for us to make 
a finding, including, but not limited to, a description of the facility, 
photographs, or construction plans, and resumes of the recipient or 
staff who will care for the specimen.
    (3) We use the best available information on the requirements of the 
species in making a decision and will consult with experts and other 
Federal and State agencies, as necessary and appropriate.
    (4) The degree of scrutiny that we give an application is based on 
the biological and husbandry or horticultural needs of the species.
    (c) Specific factors considered for wildlife. In addition to the 
general provisions in paragraph (e) of this section, we consider the 
following factors in evaluating suitable housing and care for wildlife:
    (1) Enclosures constructed and maintained so as to provide 
sufficient space to allow each animal to make normal postural and social 
adjustments with adequate freedom of movement. Inadequate space may be 
indicated by evidence of malnutrition, poor condition, debility, stress, 
or abnormal behavior patterns.
    (2) Appropriate forms of environmental enrichment, such as nesting 
material, perches, climbing apparatus, ground substrate, or other 
species-specific materials or objects.
    (3) If the wildlife is on public display, an off-exhibit area, 
consisting of indoor and outdoor accommodations, as appropriate, that 
can house the wildlife on a long-term basis if necessary.
    (4) Provision of water and nutritious food of a nature and in a way 
that are appropriate for the species.
    (5) Staff who are trained and experienced in providing proper daily 
care and maintenance for the species being imported or introduced from 
the sea, or for a closely related species.
    (6) Readily available veterinary care or veterinary staff 
experienced with

[[Page 173]]

the species or a closely related species, including emergency care.
    (d) Specific factors considered for plants. In addition to the 
general provisions in paragraph (e) of the section, we consider the 
following factors in evaluating suitable housing and care for plants:
    (1) Sufficient space, appropriate lighting, and other environmental 
conditions that will ensure proper growth.
    (2) Ability to provide appropriate culture, such as water, 
fertilizer, and pest and disease control.
    (3) Staff with experience with the imported species or related 
species with similar horticultural requirements.
    (e) General factors considered for wildlife and plants. In addition 
to the specific provisions in paragraphs (c) or (d) of this section, we 
will consider the following factors in evaluating suitable housing and 
care for wildlife and plants:
    (1) Adequate enclosures or holding areas to prevent escape or 
unplanned exchange of genetic material with specimens of the same or 
different species outside the facility.
    (2) Appropriate security to prevent theft of specimens and measures 
taken to rectify any previous theft or security problem.
    (3) A reasonable survival rate of specimens of the same species or, 
alternatively, closely related species at the facility, mortalities for 
the previous 3 years, significant injuries to wildlife or damage to 
plants, occurrence of significant disease outbreaks during the previous 
3 years, and measures taken to prevent similar mortalities, injuries, 
damage, or diseases. Significant injuries, damage, or disease outbreaks 
are those that are permanently debilitating or re-occurring.
    (4) Sufficient funding on a long-term basis to cover the cost of 
maintaining the facility and the specimens imported.
    (f) Incomplete facilities or insufficient staff. For applications 
submitted to us before the facilities to hold the specimen are completed 
or the staff is identified or properly trained, we will:
    (1) Review all available information, including construction plans 
or intended staffing, and make a finding based on this information.
    (2) Place a condition on any permit that the import cannot occur 
until the facility has been completed or the staff hired and trained, 
and approved by us.

           Subpart E_International Trade in Certain Specimens


<R05>
Sec. 23.68  How can I trade internationally in roots of American ginseng?

    (a) U.S. and foreign general provisions. Whole plants and roots 
(whole, sliced, and parts, excluding manufactured parts, products, and 
derivatives, such as powders, pills, extracts, tonics, teas, and 
confectionery) of American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius), whether wild 
or artificially propagated, are included in Appendix II. Cultivated 
American ginseng that does not meet the requirements of artificially 
propagated will be considered wild for export and re-export purposes. 
The import, export, or re-export of ginseng roots must meet the 
requirements of this section and other requirements of this part (see 
subparts B and C for prohibitions and application procedures). For 
specimens that were harvested from a State or Tribe without an approved 
CITES export program, see Sec. 23.36 for export permits and Sec. 23.37 
for re-export certificates.
    (b) Export approval of State and tribal programs. States and Tribes 
set up and maintain ginseng management and harvest programs designed to 
monitor and protect American ginseng from over-harvest. When a State or 
Tribe with a management program provides us with the necessary 
information, we make programmatic findings and have specific 
requirements that allow export under CITES. For wild ginseng, a State or 
Tribe must provide sufficient information for us to determine that its 
management program and harvest controls are appropriate to ensure that 
ginseng harvested within its jurisdiction is legally acquired and that 
export will not be detrimental to the survival of the species in the 
wild. For artificially propagated ginseng, a State or Tribe must provide 
sufficient information for us to determine that ginseng grown within its 
jurisdiction meets the definition of artificially propagated and the 
State or Tribe must have procedures in place to minimize the risk

[[Page 174]]

that the roots of wild-collected plants would be claimed as artificially 
propagated.
    (1) A State or Tribe seeking initial CITES export program approval 
for wild or artificially propagated American ginseng must submit the 
following information on the adoption and implementation of regulatory 
measures to the U.S. Management Authority:
    (i) Laws or regulations mandating licensing or registration of 
persons buying and selling ginseng in that State or on tribal lands.
    (ii) A requirement that ginseng dealers maintain records and provide 
copies of those records to the appropriate State or tribal management 
agency upon request. Dealer records must contain: the name and address 
of the ginseng seller, date of transaction, whether the ginseng is wild 
or artificially propagated and dried or green at time of transaction, 
weight of roots, State or Tribe of origin of roots, and identification 
numbers of the State or tribal certificates used to ship ginseng from 
the State or Tribe of origin.
    (iii) A requirement that State or tribal personnel will inspect 
roots, ensure legal harvest, and have the ability to determine the age 
of roots of all wild-collected ginseng harvested in the State or on 
tribal lands. State or tribal personnel may accept a declaration 
statement by the licensed or registered dealer or grower that the 
ginseng roots are artificially propagated.
    (iv) A requirement that State or tribal personnel will weigh ginseng 
roots unsold by March 31 of the year after harvest and give a weight 
receipt to the owner of the roots. Future export certification of this 
stock must be issued against the weight receipt.
    (v) A requirement that State or tribal personnel will issue 
certificates for wild and artificially propagated ginseng. These 
certificates must contain at a minimum:
    (A) State of origin.
    (B) Serial number of certificate.
    (C) Dealer's State or tribal license or registration number.
    (D) Dealer's shipment number for that harvest season.
    (E) Year of harvest of ginseng being certified.
    (F) Designation as wild or artificially propagated.
    (G) Designation as dried or fresh (green) roots.
    (H) Weight of roots.
    (I) Statement of State or tribal certifying official verifying that 
the ginseng was obtained in that State or on those tribal lands in 
accordance with all relevant laws for that harvest year.
    (J) Name and title of State or tribal certifying official.
    (2) In addition, a State or Tribe seeking initial CITES export 
program approval for wild American ginseng must submit the following 
information to the U.S. Management Authority:
    (i) An assessment of the condition of the population and trends, 
including a description of the types of information on which the 
assessment is based, such as an analysis of population demographics; 
population models; or analysis of past harvest levels or indices of 
abundance independent of harvest information, such as field surveys.
    (ii) Historic, present, and potential distribution of wild ginseng 
on a county-by-county basis.
    (iii) Phenology of ginseng, including flowering and fruiting 
periods.
    (iv) Habitat evaluation.
    (v) If available, copies of any ginseng management or monitoring 
plans or other relevant reports that the State or Tribe has prepared as 
part of its existing management program.
    (3) A State or Tribe with an approved CITES export program must 
complete Form 3-200-61 and submit it to the U.S. Management Authority by 
May 31 of each year to provide information on the previous harvest 
season.
    (c) U.S. application process. Application forms and a list of States 
and Tribes with approved ginseng programs can be obtained from our 
website or by contacting us (see Sec. 23.7).
    (1) To export wild or artificially propagated ginseng harvested 
under an approved State or tribal program, complete Form 3-200-34 or 
Form 3-200-74 for additional single-use permits under an annual program 
file.
    (2) To export wild ginseng harvested from a State or Tribe that does 
not have an approved program, complete Form 3-200-32. To export 
artificially propagated ginseng from a State or

[[Page 175]]

Tribe that does not have an approved program, complete Form 3-200-33.
    (3) To re-export ginseng, complete Form 3-200-32.
    (4) For information on issuance criteria for CITES documents, see 
Sec. 23.36 for export permits, Sec. 23.37 for re-export certificates, 
and Sec. 23.40 for certificates for artificially propagated plants.
    (d) Conditions for export. Upon export, roots must be accompanied by 
a State or tribal certificate containing the information specified in 
paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 23.69  How can I trade internationally in fur skins and fur skin

products of bobcat, river otter, Canada lynx, gray wolf, and brown bear?

    (a) U.S. and foreign general provisions. For purposes of this 
section, CITES furbearers means bobcat (Lynx rufus), river otter (Lontra 
canadensis), and Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis), and the Alaskan 
populations of gray wolf (Canis lupus), and brown bear (Ursus arctos). 
These species are included in Appendix II based on Article II(2)(b) of 
the Treaty (see Sec. 23.89). The import, export, or re-export of fur 
skins and fur skin products must meet the requirements of this section 
and the other requirements of this part (see subparts B and C for 
prohibitions and application procedures). For specimens that were 
harvested from a State or Tribe without an approved CITES export 
program, see Sec. 23.36 for export permits and Sec. 23.37 for re-export 
certificates.
    (b) Export approval of State and tribal programs. States and Tribes 
set up and maintain management and harvest programs designed to monitor 
and protect CITES furbearers from over-harvest. When a State or Tribe 
with a management program provides us with the necessary information, we 
make programmatic findings and have specific requirements that allow 
export under CITES. A State or Tribe must provide sufficient information 
for us to determine that its management program and harvest controls are 
appropriate to ensure that CITES furbearers harvested within its 
jurisdiction are legally acquired and that export will not be 
detrimental to the survival of the species in the wild.
    (1) A State or Tribe seeking initial CITES export program approval 
must submit the following information to the U.S. Management Authority, 
except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section:
    (i) An assessment of the condition of the population and a 
description of the types of information on which the assessment is 
based, such as an analysis of carcass demographics, population models, 
analysis of past harvest levels as a function of fur prices or trapper 
effort, or indices of abundance independent of harvest information, such 
as scent station surveys, archer surveys, camera traps, track or scat 
surveys, or road kill counts.
    (ii) Current harvest control measures, including laws regulating 
harvest seasons and methods.
    (iii) Total allowable harvest of the species.
    (iv) Distribution of harvest.
    (v) Indication of how frequently harvest levels are evaluated.
    (vi) Tagging or marking requirements for fur skins.
    (vii) Habitat evaluation.
    (viii) If available, copies of any furbearer management plans or 
other relevant reports that the State or Tribe has prepared as part of 
its existing management program.
    (2) If the U.S. Scientific Authority has made a range-wide non-
detriment finding for a species, a State or Tribe seeking initial 
approval for a CITES export program for that species need only submit 
the information in (b)(1)(ii) and (vi) of this section.
    (3) A State or Tribe with an approved CITES export program must 
submit a CITES furbearer activity report to the U.S. Management 
Authority by October 31 of each year that provides information as to 
whether or not the population status or management of the species has 
changed within the State or tribal lands. This report may reference 
information provided in previous years if the information has not 
changed. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, a 
furbearer activity report should include, at a minimum, the following:
    (i) For each species, the number of specimens taken and the number 
of animals tagged, if different.

[[Page 176]]

    (ii) An assessment of the condition of the population, including 
trends, and a description of the types of information on which the 
assessment is based. If population levels are decreasing, the activity 
report should include the State or Tribe's professional assessment of 
the reason for the decline and any steps being taken to address it.
    (iii) Information on, and a copy of, any changes in laws or 
regulations affecting these species.
    (iv) If available, copies of relevant reports that the State or 
Tribe has prepared during the year in question as part of its existing 
management programs for CITES furbearers.
    (4) When the U.S. Scientific Authority has made a range-wide non-
detriment finding for a species, the annual furbearer activity report 
from a State or Tribe with an approved export program for that species 
should include, at a minimum, a statement indicating whether or not the 
status of the species has changed and the information in paragraph 
(b)(3)(iii) and (iv) of this section. Range-wide non-detriment findings 
will be re-evaluated at least every 5 years, or sooner if information 
indicates that there has been a change in the status or management of 
the species that might lead to different treatment of the species. When 
a range-wide non-detriment finding is re-evaluated, States and Tribes 
with an approved export program for the species must submit information 
that allows us to determine whether our finding remains valid.
    (c) CITES tags. Unless an alternative method has been approved, each 
CITES fur skin to be exported or re-exported must have a U.S. CITES tag 
permanently attached.
    (1) The tag must be inserted through the skin and permanently locked 
in place using the locking mechanism of the tag.
    (2) The legend on the CITES tag must include the US-CITES logo, an 
abbreviation for the State or Tribe of harvest, a standard species code 
assigned by the Management Authority, and a unique serial number.
    (3) Fur skins with broken, cut, or missing tags may not be exported. 
Replacement tags must be obtained before the furs are presented for 
export or re-export. To obtain a replacement tag, either from the State 
or Tribe that issued the original tag or from us, you must provide 
information to show that the fur was legally acquired.
    (i) When a tag is broken, cut, or missing, you may contact the State 
or Tribe of harvest for a replacement tag. If the State or Tribe cannot 
replace it, you may apply to FWS Law Enforcement for a replacement tag. 
If the tag is broken or cut, you must give us the tag. If the tag is 
missing, you must provide details concerning how the tag was lost. If we 
are satisfied that the fur was legally acquired, we will provide a CITES 
replacement tag.
    (ii) A replacement tag must meet all of the requirements in 
paragraph (c) of this section, except the legend will include only the 
US-CITES logo, FWS-REPL, and a unique serial number.
    (4) Tags are not required on fur skin products.
    (d) Documentation requirements. The U.S. CITES export permit or an 
annex attached to the permit must contain all information that is given 
on the tag.
    (e) U.S. application process. Application forms and a list of States 
and Tribes with approved furbearer programs can be obtained from our 
website or by contacting us (see Sec. 23.7).
    (1) To export fur skins taken under an approved State or tribal 
program, complete Form 3-200-26 and submit it to either FWS Law 
Enforcement or the U.S. Management Authority.
    (2) To export fur skins that were not harvested under an approved 
program, complete Form 3-200-27 and submit it to the U.S. Management 
Authority.
    (3) To re-export fur skins, complete Form 3-200-73 and submit it 
either to FWS Law Enforcement or the U.S. Management Authority.
    (4) For information on issuance criteria for CITES documents, see 
Sec. 23.36 for export permits and Sec. 23.37 for re-export 
certificates.
    (f) Conditions for export. Upon export, each fur skin, other than a 
fur skin product, must be clearly identified in accordance with 
paragraph (c) of this section.

Sec. 23.70  How can I trade internationally in American alligator and

other crocodilian skins, parts, and products?

    (a) U.S. and foreign general provisions. For the purposes of this 
section, crocodilian means all species of alligator, caiman, crocodile, 
and gavial of the order Crocodylia. The import, export, or re-export of 
any crocodilian skins, parts, or products must meet the requirements of 
this section and the other requirements of this part (see subparts B and 
C for prohibitions and application procedures). For American alligator 
(Alligator mississippiensis) specimens harvested from a State or Tribe 
without an approved CITES export program, see Sec. 23.36 for export 
permits and Sec. 23.37 for re-export certificates.
    (b) Definitions. Terms used in this section are defined as follows:
    (1) Crocodilian skins means whole or partial skins, flanks, 
chalecos, and bellies (including those that are salted, crusted, tanned, 
partially tanned, or otherwise processed), including skins of sport-
hunted trophies.
    (2) Crocodilian parts means body parts with or without skin attached 
(including tails, throats, feet, meat, skulls, and other parts) and 
small cut skin pieces.
    (c) Export approval of State and tribal programs for American 
alligator. States and Tribes set up and maintain management and harvest 
programs designed to monitor and protect American alligators from over-
harvest. When a State or Tribe with a management program provides us 
with the necessary information, we make programmatic findings and have 
specific requirements that allow export under CITES. A State or Tribe 
must provide sufficient information for us to determine that its 
management program and harvest controls are appropriate to ensure that 
alligators harvested within its jurisdiction are legally acquired and 
that the export will not be detrimental to the survival of the species 
in the wild.
    (1) A State or Tribe seeking initial CITES export program approval 
must submit the following to the U.S. Management Authority:
    (i) An assessment of the condition of the wild population and a 
description of the types of information on which the assessment is 
based, such as an analysis of carcass demographics, population models, 
analysis of past harvest levels as a function of skin prices or 
harvester effort, or indices of abundance independent of harvest 
information, such as nest surveys, spotlighting surveys, or nuisance 
complaints.
    (ii) Current harvest control measures, including laws regulating 
harvest seasons and methods.
    (iii) Total allowable harvest of the species.
    (iv) Distribution of harvest.
    (v) Indication of how frequently harvest levels are evaluated.
    (vi) Tagging or marking requirements for skins and parts.
    (vii) Habitat evaluation.
    (viii) Information on nuisance alligator management programs.
    (ix) Information on alligator farming programs, including whether 
collecting and rearing of eggs or hatchlings is allowed, what factors 
are used to set harvest levels, and whether any alligators are returned 
to the wild.
    (x) If available, copies of any alligator management plans or other 
relevant reports for American alligator that the State or Tribe has 
prepared as part of its existing management program.
    (2) A State or Tribe with an approved CITES export program must 
submit an American alligator activity report to the U.S. Management 
Authority by July 1 of each year to provide information regarding 
harvests during the previous year. This report may reference information 
provided in previous years if the information has not changed. An 
American alligator activity report, at a minimum, should include the 
following:
    (i) The total number of skins from wild or farmed alligators that 
were tagged by the State or Tribe.
    (ii) An assessment of the status of the alligator population with an 
indication of whether the population is stable, increasing, or 
decreasing, and at what rate (if known). If population levels are 
decreasing, activity reports should include the State or Tribe's 
professional assessment of the reason for

[[Page 178]]

the decline and any steps being taken to address it.
    (iii) For wild alligators, information on harvest, including harvest 
of nuisance alligators, methods used to determine harvest levels, 
demographics of the harvest, and methods used to determine the total 
number and population trends of alligators in the wild.
    (iv) For farmed alligators, information on whether collecting and 
rearing of eggs or hatchlings is allowed, what factors are used to set 
harvest levels, and whether any alligators are returned to the wild.
    (v) Information on, and a copy of, any changes in laws or 
regulations affecting the American alligator.
    (vi) If available, copies of relevant reports that the State or 
Tribe has prepared during the reporting period as part of its existing 
management program for the American alligator.
    (3) We provide CITES export tags to States and Tribes with approved 
CITES export programs. American alligator skins and parts must meet the 
marking and tagging requirements of paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this 
section.
    (d) Tagging of crocodilian skins. You may import, export, or re-
export any crocodilian skin only if a non-reusable tag is inserted 
though the skin and locked in place using the locking mechanism of the 
tag. A mounted sport-hunted trophy must be accompanied by the tag from 
the skin used to make the mount.
    (1) Except as provided for a replacement tag in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) 
of this section, the tag must:
    (i) Be self-locking, heat resistant, and inert to chemical and 
mechanical processes.
    (ii) Be permanently stamped with the two-letter ISO code for the 
country of origin, a unique serial number, a standardized species code 
(available on our website; see Sec. 23.7), and the year of production 
or harvest. For American alligator, the export tags include the US-CITES 
logo, an abbreviation for the State or Tribe of harvest, a standard 
species code (MIS = Alligator mississippiensis), the year of taking, and 
a unique serial number.
    (iii) If the year of production or harvest and serial number appear 
next to each other on a tag, the information should be separated by a 
hyphen.
    (2) Skins and flanks must be individually tagged, and chalecos must 
have a tag attached to each flank.
    (3) Skins with broken, cut, or missing tags may not be exported. 
Replacement tags must be obtained before the skins are presented for 
import, export, or re-export. To obtain a replacement tag, either from 
the State or Tribe of harvest (for American alligator) or from us, you 
must provide information to show that the skin was legally acquired.
    (i) In the United States, when an American alligator tag is broken, 
cut, or missing, you may contact the State or Tribe of harvest for a 
replacement tag. If the State or Tribe cannot replace it, you may apply 
to FWS Law Enforcement for a replacement tag. To obtain replacement tags 
for crocodilian skins other than American alligator in the United 
States, contact FWS Law Enforcement. If the tag is broken or cut, you 
must give us the tag. If the tag is missing, you must provide details 
concerning how the tag was lost. If we are satisfied that the skin was 
legally acquired, we will provide a CITES replacement tag.
    (ii) A replacement tag must meet all of the requirements in 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section except that the species code and year 
of production or harvest will not be required, and for re-exports the 
country of re-export must be shown in place of the country of origin. In 
the United States, the legend will include the US-CITES logo, FWS-REPL, 
and a unique serial number.
    (e) Meat and skulls. Except for American alligator, you may import, 
export, or re-export crocodilian meat and skulls without tags or 
markings. American alligator meat and skulls may be imported, exported, 
or re-exported if packaged and marked or tagged in accordance with State 
or tribal laws as follows:
    (1) Meat from legally harvested and tagged alligators must be packed 
in permanently sealed containers and labeled as required by State or 
tribal laws or regulations. Bulk meat containers must be marked with any 
required State or tribal parts tag or bulk

[[Page 179]]

meat tag permanently attached and indicating, at a minimum, State or 
Tribe of origin, year of take, species, original U.S. CITES tag number 
for the corresponding skin, weight of meat in the container, and 
identification of State-licensed processor or packer.
    (2) Each American alligator skull must be marked as required by 
State or tribal law or regulation. This marking must include, at a 
minimum, reference to the corresponding U.S. CITES tag number on the 
skin.
    (f) Tagging or labeling of crocodilian parts other than meat and 
skulls. You may import, export, or re-export crocodilian parts other 
than meat and skulls when the following conditions are met:
    (1) Parts must be packed in transparent sealed containers.
    (2) Containers must be clearly marked with a non-reusable parts tag 
or label that includes all of the information in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of 
this section and a description of the contents, the total weight 
(contents and container), and the number of the CITES document.
    (3) Tags are not required on crocodilian products.
    (4) Tags are not required on scientific specimens except as required 
in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.
    (g) Documentation requirements. The CITES document or an annex 
attached to the document must contain all information that is given on 
the tag or label.
    (h) U.S. application process. Application forms and a list of States 
and Tribes with approved American alligator programs can be obtained 
from our website or by contacting us (see Sec. 23.7).
    (1) To export American alligator specimens taken under an approved 
State or tribal program, complete Form 3-200-26 and submit it to either 
FWS Law Enforcement or the U.S. Management Authority.
    (2) To export American alligator specimens that are not from an 
approved program, complete Form 3-200-27 and submit it to the U.S. 
Management Authority.
    (3) For information on issuance criteria for CITES documents, see 
Sec. 23.36 for export permits and Sec. 23.37 for re-export 
certificates.
    (i) Conditions for import, export, or re-export. Upon import,

species that have a substantive annotation that designates either logs, 
sawn wood, and veneer sheets, or logs, sawn wood, veneer sheets, and 
plywood:
    (1) Change in destination. When a shipment of timber destined for 
one country is redirected to another, the Management Authority in the 
country of import may change the name and address of the importer 
indicated on the CITES document under the following conditions:
    (i) The quantity imported is the same as the quantity certified by a 
stamp or seal and authorized signature of the Management Authority on

modification is certified with an official stamp and signature.
    (v) The Management Authority sends a copy of the amended CITES 
document to the country of export or re-export and the Secretariat.
    (2) Extension of CITES document validity. A Management Authority in 
the country of import may extend the validity of an export permit or re-
export certificate beyond the normal maximum of 6 months after the date 
of issue under the following conditions:
    (i) The shipment has arrived in the port of final destination before 
the CITES document expires, is being held in customs bond, and is not 
considered imported.
    (ii) The time extension does not exceed 6 months from the date of 
expiration of the CITES document and no previous extension has been 
issued.
    (iii) The Management Authority has included in block 5, or an 
equivalent place, of the CITES document the date of arrival and the new 
date of expiration on the document, and certified the modification with 
an official stamp and signature.
    (iv) The shipment is imported into the country from the port where 
the Management Authority issued the extension and before the amended 
CITES document expires.
    (v) The Management Authority sends a copy of the amended CITES 
document to the country of export or re-export and to the Secretariat.

locking tag inserted through the skin and permanently locked in place 
using the locking mechanism of the tag. The tag must indicate the 
country of origin, the number of the specimen in relation to the annual 
quota, and the calendar year in which the specimen was taken in the 
wild. A mounted sport-hunted trophy must be accompanied by the tag from 
the skin used to make the mount.
    (ii) Black rhinoceros: Parts of the trophy, including, but not 
limited to, skin, skull, or horns, whether mounted or loose, should be 
individually marked with reference to the country of origin, species, 
the number of the specimen in relation to the annual quota, and the year 
of export.
    (3) The export permit or re-export certificate or an annex attached 
to the permit or certificate must contain all the information that is 
given on the tag.

          Subpart F_Disposal of Confiscated Wildlife and Plants


<R05>
Sec. 23.78  What happens to confiscated wildlife and plants?

    (a) Purpose. Article VIII of the Treaty provides for confiscation or 
return to the country of export of specimens that are traded in 
violation of CITES.
    (b) Disposal options. Part 12 of this subchapter provides the 
options we have for disposing of forfeited and abandoned live and dead 
wildlife and plants. These include maintenance in captivity either in 
the United States or in the country of export, return to the wild under 
limited circumstances, and sale of certain Appendix-II or -III 
specimens. Under some conditions, euthanasia or destruction may be 
necessary.
    (1) We use a plant rescue center program to dispose of confiscated 
live plants. Participants in this program may also assist APHIS, CBP, 
and FWS Law Enforcement in holding seized specimens as evidence pending 
any legal decisions.
    (2) We dispose of confiscated live wildlife on a case-by-case basis 
at the time of seizure and forfeiture, and consider the quantity, 
protection level, and husbandry needs of the wildlife.
    (c) Re-export. We may issue a re-export certificate for a CITES 
specimen that was forfeited or abandoned when the certificate indicates 
the specimen was confiscated and when the re-export meets one of the 
following purposes:
    (1) For any CITES species, the return of a live specimen to the 
Management Authority of the country of export, placement of a live 
specimen in a rescue center, or use of the specimen for law enforcement, 
judicial, or forensic purposes.
    (2) For an Appendix-II or -III species, the disposal of the specimen 
in an appropriate manner that benefits enforcement and administration of 
the Convention.
    (d) Consultation process. FWS and APHIS may consult with the 
Management Authority in the country of export or re-export and other 
relevant governmental and nongovernmental experts before making a 
decision on the disposal of confiscated live specimens that have been 
forfeited or abandoned to the FWS, APHIS, or CBP.


<R05>
Sec. 23.79  How may I participate in the Plant Rescue Center Program?

    (a) Purpose. We have established the Plant Rescue Center Program to 
place confiscated live plants quickly to prevent physical damage to the 
plants.
    (b) Criteria. Institutions interested in participating in this 
program must be:
    (1) Nonprofit, open to the public, and have the expertise and 
facilities to care for confiscated exotic plant specimens. A 
participating institution may be a botanical garden, arboretum, 
zoological park, research institution, or other qualifying institution.
    (2) Willing to transfer confiscated plants from the port where they 
were confiscated to their facilities at their own expense.
    (3) Willing to return the plants to the U.S. Government if the 
country of export has requested their return. The U.S. Government will 
then coordinate the plants' return to the country of export.
    (4) Willing to accept and maintain a plant shipment as a unit until 
it has received authorization from us to incorporate the shipment into 
its permanent collection or transfer a portion of it to another 
participating institution.
    (c) Participation. Institutions wishing to participate in the Plant 
Rescue Center Program should contact the U.S. Management Authority (see 
Sec. 23.7). They must provide a brief description of the greenhouse or 
display facilities, the names and telephone numbers of any individuals 
authorized to accept plants on behalf of the institution, and the 
mailing address where the plants should be sent. In addition, interested 
institutions must indicate if they are limited with regard to the type 
of plants they are able to maintain or the quantities of plants they can 
handle at one time.


<R04>
                     Subpart G_CITES Administration


<R05>
Sec. 23.84  What are the roles of the Secretariat and the committees?

    (a) Secretariat. The Secretariat is headed by the Secretary-General. 
Its functions are listed in Article XII of the Treaty and include:
    (1) Arranging and staffing meetings of the Parties.

[[Page 184]]

    (2) Performing functions as requested in relation to listings in the 
Appendices.
    (3) Undertaking scientific and technical studies, as authorized by 
the CoP, to contribute to implementation of the Convention.
    (4) Studying reports of the Parties and requesting additional 
information as appropriate to ensure effective implementation of the 
Convention.
    (5) Bringing to the attention of the Parties matters relevant to the 
Convention.
    (6) Periodically publishing and distributing to the Parties current 
editions of the Appendices as well as information on the identification 
of specimens of species listed in the Appendices.
    (7) Preparing annual reports to the Parties on its work and on the 
implementation of the Convention.
    (8) Making recommendations for the implementation of the aims and 
provisions of the Convention, including the exchange of scientific and 
technical information.
    (9) Performing other functions entrusted to it by the Parties.
    (b) Committees. The Parties have established four committees to 
provide administrative and technical support to the Parties and to the 
Secretariat. The CoP may charge any of these committees with tasks.
    (1) The Standing Committee steers the work and performance of the 
Convention between CoPs.
    (i) This committee oversees development and execution of the 
Secretariat's budget, advises other committees, appoints working groups, 
and carries out activities on behalf of the Parties between CoPs.
    (ii) Regional representatives are countries that are elected by 
their respective geographic regions at the CoP.
    (2) The Animals Committee and the Plants Committee provide advice 
and guidance to the CoP, the other committees, working groups, and the 
Secretariat on all matters relevant to international trade in species 
included in the Appendices.
    (i) These committees also assist the Nomenclature Committee in the 
development and maintenance of a standardized list of species names; 
provide assistance with regard to identification of species listed in 
the Appendices; cooperate with the Secretariat to assist Scientific 
Authorities; compile and evaluate data on Appendix-II species that are 
considered significantly affected by trade; periodically review the 
status of wildlife and plant species listed in the Appendices; advise 
range countries on management techniques when requested; draft 
resolutions on wildlife and plant matters for consideration by the 
Parties; deal with issues related to the transport of live specimens; 
and report to the CoP and the Standing Committee.
    (ii) Regional representatives are individuals, who are elected by 
their respective geographic regions at the CoP.
    (3) The Nomenclature Committee is responsible for developing or 
identifying standard nomenclature references for wildlife and plant taxa 
and making recommendations on nomenclature to Parties, the CoP, other 
committees, working groups, and the Secretariat. The Nomenclature 
Committee is made up of one zoologist and one botanist, who are 
appointed by the CoP.


<R05>
Sec. 23.85  What is a meeting of the Conference of the Parties (CoP)?

    (a) Purpose. Article XI of the Treaty provides general guidelines 
for meetings of the countries that have ratified, accepted, approved, or 
acceded to CITES. The Parties currently meet for 2 weeks every 3 years. 
At these meetings, the Parties consider amendments to the Appendices and 
resolutions and decisions to improve the implementation of CITES. The 
Parties adopt amendments to the lists of species in Appendix I and II 
and resolutions by a two-thirds majority of Parties present and voting. 
The Secretariat or any Party may also submit reports on wildlife and 
plant trade for consideration.
    (b) CoP locations and dates. At a CoP, Parties interested in hosting 
the next meeting notify the Secretariat. The Parties vote to select the 
location of the next CoP. Once a country has been chosen, it works with 
the Secretariat to set the date and specific venue. The Secretariat then 
notifies the Parties of the date for the next CoP.

[[Page 185]]

    (c) Attendance at a CoP. All Parties may participate and vote at a 
CoP. Non-Party countries may participate, but may not vote. 
Organizations technically qualified in protection, conservation, or 
management of wildlife or plants may participate in a CoP as observers 
if they are approved, but they are not eligible to vote.
    (1) International organizations must apply to the CITES Secretariat 
for approval to attend a CoP as an observer.
    (2) National organizations must apply to the Management Authority of 
the country where they are located for approval to attend a CoP as an 
observer.


<R05>
Sec. 23.86  How can I obtain information on a CoP?

    As we receive information on an upcoming CoP from the CITES 
Secretariat, we will notify the public either through published notices 
in the Federal Register or postings on our website (see Sec. 23.7). We 
will provide:
    (a) A summary of the information we have received with an invitation 
for the public to comment and provide information on the agenda, 
proposed amendments to the Appendices, and proposed resolutions that 
they believe the United States should submit for consideration at the 
CoP.
    (b) Information on times, dates, and locations of public meetings.
    (c) Information on how international and national organizations may 
apply to participate as observers.


<R05>
Sec. 23.87  How does the United States develop documents and 

negotiating positions for a CoP?

    (a) In developing documents and negotiating positions for a CoP, we:
    (1) Will provide for at least one public meeting.
    (2) Consult with appropriate Federal, State, and tribal agencies; 
foreign governmental agencies; scientists; experts; and others.
    (3) Seek public comment through published Federal Register notices 
or postings on our website that:
    (i) Solicit recommendations on potential proposals to amend the 
Appendices, draft resolutions, and other documents for U.S. submission 
to the CoP.
    (ii) Announce proposals to amend the Appendices, draft resolutions, 
and other documents that the United States is considering submitting to 
the CoP.
    (iii) Provide the CoP agenda and a list of the amendments to the 
Appendices proposed for the CoP, a summary of our proposed negotiating 
positions on these items, and the reasons for our proposed positions.
    (4) Consider comments received in response to notices or postings 
provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
    (b) We submit the following documents to the Secretariat for 
consideration at the CoP:
    (1) Draft resolutions and other documents at least 150 days before 
the CoP.
    (2) Proposals to amend the Appendices at least 150 days before the 
CoP if we have consulted all range countries, or 330 days before the CoP 
if we have not consulted the range countries. For the latter, the 
additional time allows for the range countries to be consulted through 
the Secretariat.
    (c) The Director may modify or suspend any of these procedures if 
they would interfere with the timely or appropriate development of 
documents for submission to the CoP and U.S. negotiating positions.
    (d) We may receive additional information at a CoP or circumstances 
may develop that have an impact on our tentative negotiating positions. 
As a result, the U.S. representatives to a CoP may find it necessary to 
modify, reverse, or otherwise change any of those positions when to do 
so would be in the best interests of the United States or the 
conservation of the species.


<R05>
Sec. 23.88  What are the resolutions and decisions of the CoP?

    (a) Purpose. Under Article XI of the Treaty, the Parties agree to 
resolutions and decisions that clarify and interpret the Convention to 
improve its effectiveness. Resolutions are generally intended to provide 
long-standing guidance, whereas decisions typically contain instructions 
to a specific committee, Parties, or the Secretariat. Decisions are 
often intended to be implemented by a specific date, and then they 
expire.

[[Page 186]]

    (b) Effective date. A resolution or decision adopted by the Parties 
becomes effective 90 days after the last day of the meeting at which it 
was adopted, unless otherwise specified in the resolution or decision.


<R04>
                       Subpart H_Lists of Species


<R05>
Sec. 23.89  What are the criteria for listing species in Appendix I or II?

    (a) Purpose. Article XV of the Treaty sets out the procedures for 
amending CITES Appendices I and II. A species must meet trade and 
biological criteria listed in the CITES resolution for amendment of 
Appendices I and II. When determining whether a species qualifies for 
inclusion in or removal from Appendix I or II, or transfer from one 
Appendix to another, we will:
    (1) Consult with States, Tribes, range countries, relevant experts, 
other Federal agencies, and the general public.
    (2) Utilize the best available biological information.
    (3) Evaluate that information against the criteria in paragraphs (b) 
through (f) of this section.
    (b) Listing a species in Appendix I. Any species qualifies for 
inclusion in Appendix I if it is or may be affected by trade and meets, 
or is likely to meet, at least one biological criterion for Appendix I.
    (1) These criteria are:
    (i) The size of the wild population is small.
    (ii) Area of distribution is restricted.
    (iii) There is an observed, inferred, or projected marked decline in 
the population size in the wild.
    (2) Factors to be considered include, but are not limited to, 
population and range fragmentation; habitat availability or quality; 
area of distribution; taxon-specific vulnerabilities due to life 
history, behavior, or other intrinsic factors, such as migration; 
population structure and niche requirements; threats from extrinsic 
factors such as the form of exploitation, introduced species, habitat 
degradation and destruction, and stochastic events; or decreases in 
recruitment.
    (c) Listing a species in Appendix II due to actual or potential 
threats. Any species qualifies for inclusion in Appendix II if it is or 
may be affected by trade and meets at least one of the criteria for 
listing in Appendix II based on actual or potential threats to that 
species. These criteria are:
    (1) It is known, or can be inferred or projected, that the 
regulation of trade is necessary to avoid the species becoming eligible 
for inclusion in Appendix I in the near future.
    (2) It is known, or can be inferred or projected, that the 
regulation of trade in the species is required to ensure that the 
harvest of specimens from the wild is not reducing the wild population 
to a level at which its survival might be threatened by continued 
harvest or other influences.
    (d) Listing a species in Appendix II due to similarity of appearance 
or other factors. Any species qualifies for inclusion in Appendix II if 
it meets either of the criteria for listing in Appendix II due to 
similarity of appearance or other factors. These criteria are:
    (1) The specimens of the species in the form in which they are 
traded resemble specimens of a species listed in Appendix II due to 
criteria in paragraph (c) of this section or in Appendix I, such that 
enforcement officers who encounter specimens of such similar CITES 
species are unlikely to be able to distinguish between them.
    (2) There are compelling reasons other than those in paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section to ensure that effective control of trade in 
currently listed species is achieved.
    (e) Other issues. We will evaluate any potential changes to the 
Appendices, taking into consideration other issues, including but not 
limited to, split-listing, annotation, listings of higher taxa and 
hybrids, and specific listing issues related to plants and commercially 
exploited aquatic species.
    (f) Precautionary measures. We will evaluate any potential transfers 
from Appendix I to II or removal of species from the Appendices in the 
context of precautionary measures.
    (g) Proposal. If a Party determines that a taxon qualifies for 
inclusion in or removal from Appendix I or II, or transfer from one 
Appendix to another, a proposal may be submitted to the Secretariat for 
consideration by the CoP.

[[Page 187]]

    (1) The proposal should indicate the intent of the specific action 
(such as inclusion in Appendix I or II); be specific and accurate as to 
the parts and derivatives to be included in the listing; ensure that any 
proposed annotation is consistent with existing annotations; state the 
criteria against which the proposal is to be judged; and provide a 
justification for the basis on which the species meets the relevant 
criteria.
    (2) The proposal must be in a prescribed format. Contact the U.S. 
Scientific Authority for a copy (see Sec. 23.7).


<R05>
Sec. 23.90  What are the criteria for listing species in Appendix III?

    (a) Purpose. Article XVI of the Treaty sets out the procedures for 
amending Appendix III.
    (b) General procedure. A Party may unilaterally, at any time, submit 
a request to list a species in Appendix III to the CITES Secretariat. 
The listing will become effective 90 days after the Secretariat notifies 
the Parties of the request.
    (c) Criteria for listing. For a Party to list a species in Appendix 
III, all of the following criteria must be met:
    (1) The species must be native to the country listing the species.
    (2) The species must be protected under that country's laws or 
regulations to prevent or restrict exploitation and control trade, and 
the laws or regulations are being implemented.
    (3) The species is in international trade, and there are indications 
that the cooperation of other Parties would help to control illegal 
trade.
    (4) The listing Party must inform the Management Authorities of 
other range countries, the known major importing countries, the 
Secretariat, and the Animals Committee or the Plants Committee that it 
is considering the listing and seek their opinions on the potential 
effects of the listing.
    (d) Annotation. The listing Party may annotate the Appendix-III 
listing to include only specific parts, products, derivatives, or life 
stages, as long as the Secretariat is notified of the annotation.
    (e) U.S. procedure. The procedure to list a species native to the 
United States in Appendix III is as follows:
    (1) We will consult with and solicit comments from all States and 
Tribes where the species occurs and all other range countries.
    (2) We will publish a proposed rule in the Federal Register to 
solicit comments from the public.
    (3) If after evaluating the comments received and available 
information we determine the species should be listed in Appendix III, 
we will publish a final rule in the Federal Register and notify the 
Secretariat of the listing.
    (f) Removing a species from Appendix III. We will monitor the 
international trade in Appendix-III species listed by us and 
periodically evaluate whether each species continues to meet the listing 
criteria in paragraph (c) of this section. We will remove a species from 
Appendix III provided all of the following criteria are met:
    (1) International trade in the species is very limited. As a general 
guide, we will consider removal when exports involve fewer than 5 
shipments per year or fewer than 100 individual animals or plants.
    (2) Legal and illegal trade in the species, including international 
trade or interstate commerce, is determined not to be a concern.
    (g) Transferring a species from Appendix III to Appendix I or II. 
If, after monitoring the trade and evaluating the status of an Appendix-
III species we listed, we determine that the species meets the criteria 
in Sec. 23.89(b) through (d) of this section for listing in Appendix I 
or II, we will consider whether to submit a proposal to amend the 
listing at the next CoP.


<R05>
Sec. 23.91  How do I find out if a species is listed?

    (a) CITES list. The official CITES list includes species of wildlife 
and plants placed in Appendix I, II, and III in accordance with the 
provisions of Articles XV and XVI of the Treaty. This list is maintained 
by the CITES Secretariat based on decisions of the Parties. You may 
access the official list from the CITES website (see Sec. 23.7).
    (b) Effective date. Amendments to the CITES list are effective as 
follows:
    (1) Appendix-I and -II species listings adopted at the CoP are 
effective 90

[[Page 188]]

days after the last day of the CoP, unless otherwise specified in the 
proposal.
    (2) Appendix-I and -II species listings adopted between CoPs by 
postal procedures are effective 120 days after the Secretariat has 
communicated comments and recommendations on the listing to the Parties 
if the Secretariat does not receive an objection to the proposed 
amendment from a Party.
    (3) Appendix-III species listings are effective 90 days after the 
date the Secretariat has communicated such listings to the Parties. A 
listing Party may withdraw a species from the list at any time by 
notifying the Secretariat. The withdrawal is effective 30 days after the 
Secretariat has communicated the withdrawal to the Parties.


<R05>
Sec. 23.92  Are any wildlife or plants, and their parts, products,

or derivatives, exempt?

    (a) All living or dead wildlife and plants in Appendix I, II, and 
III and all their readily recognizable parts, products, and derivatives 
must meet the requirements of CITES and this part, except as indicated 
in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) The following are exempt from the requirements of CITES and do 
not need CITES documents. You may be required to demonstrate that your 
specimen qualifies as exempt under this section. For specimens that are 
exempt from CITES requirements, you must still follow the clearance 
requirements for wildlife in part 14 of this subchapter and for plants 
in part 24 of this subchapter and 7 CFR parts 319, 352, and 355.
    (1) Appendix-III wildlife and Appendix-II or -III plants.
    (i) Where an annotation designates what is excluded from CITES 
requirements, any part, product, or derivative that is specifically 
excluded.
    (ii) Where an annotation designates what is covered by the Treaty, 
all parts, products, or derivatives that are not designated.
    (2) Plant hybrids.
    (i) Seeds and pollen (including pollinia), cut flowers, and flasked 
seedlings or tissue cultures of hybrids that qualify as artificially 
propagated (see Sec. 23.64) and that were produced from one or more 
Appendix-I species or taxa that are not annotated to specifically 
include hybrids in the CITES list.
    (ii) Specimens of an Appendix-II or -III plant taxon with an 
annotation that specifically excludes hybrids.
    (3) Flasked seedlings of Appendix-I orchids. Flasked seedlings of an 
Appendix-I orchid species that qualify as artificially propagated (see 
Sec. 23.64).
    (4) Marine specimens listed in Appendix II that are protected under 
another treaty, convention, or international agreement which was in 
force on July 1, 1975 as provided in Sec. 23.39(d).
    (5) Coral sand and coral fragments as defined in Sec. 23.5.
    (6) Personal and household effects as provided in Sec. 23.15.
    (7) Urine, feces, and synthetically derived DNA as provided in Sec. 
23.16.
    (8) Certain wildlife hybrids as provided in Sec. 23.43.

<R05>
Sec. 25.11  Purpose of regulations.

    (a) The regulations in this subchapter govern general administration 
of units of the National Wildlife Refuge System, public notice of 
changes in U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service policy regarding Refuge System 
units, issuance of permits required on Refuge System units and other 
administrative aspects involving the management of various units of the 
National Wildlife Refuge System. The regulations in this subchapter 
apply to areas of land and water held by the United States in fee title 
and to property interests in such land and water in less than fee, 
including but not limited to easements. For areas held in less than fee, 
the regulations in this subchapter apply only to the extent that the 
property interest held by the United States may be affected. The 
regulations in this subchapter also apply to and govern those areas of 
the Rocky Mountain Arsenal over which management responsibility has been 
transferred to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service under the Rocky 
Mountain Arsenal Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-402, 106 Stat. 1961), before 
their establishment as a refuge and inclusion in the National Wildlife 
Refuge System.
    (b) All national wildlife refuges are maintained for the primary 
purpose of developing a national program of wildlife and ecological 
conservation and rehabilitation. These refuges are established for the 
restoration, preservation, development and management of wildlife and 
wildlands habitat; for the protection and preservation of endangered or 
threatened species and their habitat; and for the management of wildlife 
and wildlands to obtain the maximum benefits from these resources.

<R04>
                   Subpart B_Administrative Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 25.21  When and how do we open and close areas of the National 

Wildlife Refuge System to public access and use or continue a use?

    (a) Except as provided below, all areas included in the National 
Wildlife Refuge System are closed to public access until and unless we 
open the area for a use or uses in accordance with the National Wildlife 
Refuge System Administration Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 668dd-668ee), the 
Refuge Recreation Act of 1962 (16 U.S.C. 460k-460k-4) and this 
subchapter C. See 50 CFR 36 for details on use and access restrictions, 
and the public participation and closure process established for Alaska 
national wildlife refuges. We may open an area by regulation, individual 
permit, or public notice, in accordance with Sec. 25.31 of this 
subchapter.
    (b) We may open a national wildlife refuge for any refuge use, or 
expand, renew, or extend an existing refuge use only after the Refuge 
Manager determines that it is a compatible use and not inconsistent with 
any applicable law. Lands subject to the patent restrictions imposed by 
Section 22(g) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act are subject to 
the compatibility requirements of Parts 25 and 26 of 50 CFR except as 
otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (1) We will complete compatibility determinations for uses of Alaska 
Native Claims Settlement Act 22(g) lands in compliance with the 
following requirements:
    (i) Refuge managers will work with 22(g) landowners in 
implementation of these regulations. The landowners should contact the 
Refuge Manager in advance of initiating a use and request a 
compatibility determination. After a compatibility determination is 
requested, refuge managers have no longer than ninety (90) days to 
complete the compatibility determination and notify the landowner of the 
finding by providing a copy of the compatibility determination or to 
inform the landowner of the specific reasons for delay. If a refuge 
manager believes that a finding of not compatible is likely, the Refuge 
Manager will notify the landowner prior to rendering a decision to 
encourage dialog on how the proposed use might be modified to be 
compatible.
    (ii) Refuge managers will allow all uses proposed by 22(g) 
landowners when the Refuge Manager determines the use to be compatible 
with refuge purposes.
    (iii) Compatibility determinations will include only evaluations of 
how the proposed use would affect the ability of the refuge to meet its 
mandated purposes. The National Wildlife Refuge System mission will not 
be considered in the evaluation. Refuge purposes will include both pre-
ANILCA purposes and those established by ANILCA, so long as they do not 
conflict. If conflicts arise, ANILCA purposes will take precedence.
    (iv) A determination that a use is not compatible may be appealed by 
the landowner to the Regional Director. The appeal must be submitted in 
writing within forty-five (45) days of receipt of the determination. The 
appeals process provided for in 50 CFR 36.41(i) (3) through (5) will 
apply.
    (v) Compatibility determinations for proposed uses of 22(g) lands 
will only evaluate the effects of the use on the adjacent refuge lands, 
and the ability of that refuge to achieve its purposes, not on the 
effects of the proposed use to the 22(g) lands.
    (vi) Compatibility determinations for 22(g) lands that a use is 
compatible are

[[Page 195]]

not subject to re-evaluation unless the use changes significantly, 
significant new information is made available that could affect the 
compatibility determination, or if requested by the landowner.
    (vii) Refuge comprehensive conservation plans will not include 22(g) 
lands, and compatibility determinations affecting such lands will not to 
be automatically re-evaluated when the plans are routinely updated.
    (viii) Refuge special use permits will not be required for 
compatible uses of 22(g) lands. Special conditions necessary to ensure a 
proposed use is compatible may be included in the compatibility 
determination and must be complied with for the use to be considered 
compatible.
    (c) The Refuge Manager may temporarily allow or initiate any refuge 
use without making a compatibility determination if necessary to protect 
the health and safety of the public or any fish or wildlife population.
    (d) When we add lands to the National Wildlife Refuge System, the 
Refuge Manager will identify, prior to acquisition, withdrawal, 
transfer, reclassification, or donation of those lands, existing 
wildlife-dependent recreational public uses (if any) determined to be 
compatible that we will permit to continue on an interim basis, pending 
completion of the comprehensive conservation plan for the national 
wildlife refuge. We will make these compatibility determinations in 
accordance with procedures in Sec. 26.41 of this subchapter.
    (e) In the event of a threat or emergency endangering the health and 
safety of the public or property or to protect the resources of the 
area, the Refuge Manager may close or curtail refuge uses of all or any 
part of an opened area to public access and use in accordance with the 
provisions in Sec. 25.31, without advance notice. See 50 CFR 36.42 for 
procedures on closing Alaska national wildlife refuges.
    (f) We will re-evaluate compatibility determinations for existing 
wildlife-dependent recreational uses when conditions under which the use 
is permitted change significantly, or if there is significant new 
information regarding the effects of the use, or concurrently with the 
preparation or revision of a comprehensive conservation plan, or at 
least every 15 years, whichever is earlier. In addition, a refuge 
manager always may re-evaluate the compatibility of a use at any time.
    (g) Except for uses specifically authorized for a period longer than 
10 years (such as right-of-ways), we will re-evaluate compatibility 
determinations for all existing uses other than wildlife-dependent 
recreational uses when conditions under which the use is permitted 
change significantly, or if there is significant new information 
regarding the effects of the use, or at least every 10 years, whichever 
is earlier. In addition, a refuge manager always may re-evaluate the 
compatibility of a use at any time.
    (h) For uses in existence on November 17, 2000 that were 
specifically authorized for a period longer than 10 years (such as 
right-of-ways), our compatibility re-evaluation will examine compliance 
with the terms and conditions of the authorization, not the 
authorization itself. We will frequently monitor and review the activity 
to ensure that the permittee carries out all permit terms and 
conditions. However, the Service will request modifications to the terms 
and conditions of these permits from the permittee if the Service 
determines that such changes are necessary to ensure that the use 
remains compatible. After November 17, 2000 no uses will be permitted or 
re-authorized, for a period longer than 10 years, unless the terms and 
conditions for such long-term permits specifically allows for 
modifications to the terms and conditions, if necessary to ensure 
compatibility. We will make a new compatibility determination prior to 
extending or renewing such long-term uses at the expiration of the 
authorization. When we prepare a compatibility determination for re-
authorization of an existing right-of-way, we will base our analysis on 
the existing conditions with the use in place, not from a pre-use 
perspective.
    (i) When we re-evaluate a use for compatibility, we will take a 
fresh look at the use and prepare a new compatibility determination 
following the procedure outlined in 50 CFR 26.41.

<R05>
Sec. 25.44  How do we grant permits for easement area uses?

    (a) The provisions of this subsection shall govern the regulation of 
activities that affect easement interests acquired by the United States. 
All other provisions of subchapter C shall apply to activities within 
such easement areas, but only to the extent that those provisions are 
directly or indirectly related to the protection of those easement 
interests expressly acquired by the United States which are specified in 
the easement agreement itself, and are not inconsistent with the 
provisions of this subsection.
    (b) We require permits for use of easement areas administered by us 
where proposed activities may affect the property interest acquired by 
the United States. Applications for permits will be submitted in writing 
to the Regional Director or a designee. We may grant special use permits 
to owners of servient estates, or to third parties with the owner's 
agreement, by the Regional Director or a designee, upon written 
determination that such permitted use is compatible. If we ultimately 
determine that the requested use will not affect the United States' 
interest, the Regional Director will issue a letter of non-objection.
    (c) In instances where the third applicant is a governmental entity 
which has acquired a partial interest in the servient estate by 
subsequent condemnation, a special use permit may be granted to the 
governmental entity without the servient estate owner's agreement if the 
regional director or his or her designee determines:
    (1) The permitted use is compatible; and
    (2) The permitted use is consistent with the partial property 
interests obtained through condemnation.
    (d) Regulations pertaining to rights-of-way in easement areas are 
contained in 50 CFR part 29.21.

                                 Access

    (a) Access qualifications and specifications. (1) As provided for in 
Pub. L. 96-315, permanent, full-time residents who can furnish to the 
refuge manager, Back Bay NWR, adequate proof of continuous and 
continuing residency, commencing prior to December 31, 1979, on the 
Outer Banks from the refuge boundary south to and including the village 
of Corolla, North Carolina, as long as they remain permanent, full-time 
residents. The south boundary of the area for access consideration is 
defined as a straight east-west line extending from Currituck Sound to 
the Atlantic Ocean and passing through a point 1,600 feet due south of 
the Currituck lighthouse. ``Residence'' means a place of general abode; 
``Place of general abode'' means a person's principal, actual dwelling 
place in fact, without regard to intent. A ``dwelling'' means a 
residential structure occupied on a year-round basis by the permit 
applicant and shall not include seasonal or part-time dwelling units 
such as beach houses, vacation cabins, or structures which are 
intermittently occupied.
    (2) As provided for in Pub. L. 98-146, ``Up to 15 additional permits 
shall be granted to those persons meeting any one of the following 
conditions:''
    (i) A resident as of July 1, 1982, who held a valid Service access 
permit for improved property owners at any time during the period from 
July 29, 1976, through December 31, 1979.
    (ii) Anyone in continuous residency since 1976, in the area bounded 
on the north by the refuge boundary, and on the south by a straight line 
passing through a point in the east-west prolongation of the centerline 
of Albacore Street, Whaleshead Club Subdivision, Currituck County, North 
Carolina.
    (iii) Any permanent, full time resident as of April 1, 1983, 
residing in the area outlined in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section 
and not otherwise eligible, who can substantiate to the Secretary of the 
Interior that access is essential to their maintaining a livelihood; so 
long as they maintain full-time continuous employment in the Norfolk, 
Virginia, area may qualify for access.
    (3) The burden of proving that the prospective permittee meets these 
criteria shall be on the applicant by presentation of adequate 
documentation to the refuge manager. Permittees may be required to 
submit additional documentation of their eligibility to the refuge 
manager in order to maintain access. Permits will be issued only to 
those who legally qualify for them.
    (4) Only one permit will be issued per family. All permits issued 
will be terminated in the event that alternate access becomes available 
during the permit period.
    (5) Permits are issued for the purpose of providing ingress and 
egress across the refuge beach to the permittee's residence. Personal 
access is limited to permittees, their families, relatives, and guests 
while being transported in the permittee's vehicle. ``Personal access'' 
means private, non-commercial use. Permits are not transferable by sale 
or devise.
    (6) All vehicle occupants must provide positive identification upon 
the request of any refuge official.

[[Page 202]]

    (b) Routes of travel. Access to, and travel along, the refuge beach 
by motorized vehicles may be allowed between the dune crossing at the 
key card operated gate near the refuge headquarters, and the south 
boundary of the refuge only after a permit has been issued or 
authorization provided by the refuge manager. Travel along the refuge 
beach by motorized vehicle shall be below the high tide line, within the 
intertidal zone, to the maximum extent practicable. This may require 
permittees to adjust their travel times to avoid high tides which would 
require the use of the emergency storm access/evacuation route over the 
east dike.
    (c) Number of trips allowed. Permittees and members of their 
immediate families residing with them are limited to a total of two 
round trips per day per household.
    (d) Hours of travel. Travel along the designated route is permitted 
24 hours per day from October 1 through April 30. Travel is restricted 
to the hours of 5:00 a.m. to 12:00 midnight from May 1 through September 
30.
    (e) Medical emergencies. Private vehicles used in a medical 
emergency will be granted access. A ``medical emergency'' means any 
condition that threatens human life or limb unless medical treatment is 
immediately obtained.

The vehicle operator is required to provide the refuge manager with a 
doctor's statement confirming the emergency within 36 hours after the 
access has occurred.
    (f) Military, fire or emergency vehicles. Military, fire, emergency

refuge manager. Continuous or recurring use of the refuge beach for 
other than emergency purposes shall require the issuance of a permit 
from the refuge manager.
    (g) Public utility vehicles. Public utility vehicles used on 
official business will be granted access. A permit specifying the times 
and types of access will be issued by the refuge manager. A ``public 
utility vehicle'' means any vehicle owned or operated by a public 
utility company enfranchised to supply Outer Banks residents with 
electricity or telephone service.
    (h) Essential commercial service vehicles. (1) Essential commercial 
service vehicles on business calls during the hours of 8 a.m.-5 p.m. 
Monday through Friday will be granted access, only upon prior approval 
of the refuge manager when responding to a request from a permittee. 
Such requests may be verbal or in writing. Access by essential 
commercial service vehicles will be granted only after all other 
reasonable alternatives to access through the refuge have been exhausted 
as determined by the refuge manager.
    (2) ``Commercial service vehicle'' means any vehicle owned or 
operated by or on behalf of an individual, partnership, or corporation 
that is properly licensed to engage entirely in the business of 
furnishing emergency repair services, including but not limited to 
plumbing, electrical, and repairs to household appliances.
    (3) Emergency situations. The refuge manager, upon reasonable 
notification, will be able to authorize essential service/emergency 
repair access, outside the prescribed time periods, for emergency 
situations should they arise.
    (i) False Cape State Park employees. False Cape State Park and 
Virginia Game Commission employees who are residents in the park will be 
considered as permanent, full-time residents as defined in Sec. 
26.34(a) with access privileges identical to those of other permittees 
with beach access privileges.
    (j) Commercial fishermen, businesses and their employees. (1) 
Commercial fishermen who have verified that their fishing operations on 
the Outer Banks of Virginia Beach, Virginia, or Currituck County, North 
Carolina, have been dependent since 1972 on ingress and egress to or 
across the refuge are granted permits for access. Travel through the 
refuge by commercial fishermen from Currituck County, North Carolina, 
will be permitted only when directly associated with commercial fishing 
operations. Drivers and passengers on trips through the refuge are 
limited to commercial fishing crew members. A commercial fisherman means

[[Page 203]]

one who harvests finfish by gill net or haul seine in the Atlantic 
Ocean, and who has owned and operated a commercial fishing businesses 
continuously since 1972. Commercial permits are not transferable by sale 
or devise. The level of commercial permittee travel across the refuge 
shall not increase above the average yearly levels maintained in the 
1985-1987 period.
    (2) Other businesses who have verified that their business 
operations on the Outer Banks of Currituck County, North Carolina, have 
been dependent since 1972 on ingress and egress to or across the refuge 
will be granted permits for access in accordance with the limitations 
outlined in paragraph (j)(1) of this section.
    (3) Each commercial fisherman or other business may be granted a 
maximum of five designated employees to travel the refuge beach for 
commercial fishing or other business-related purposes only. Commercial 
fishing employees may carry only other commercial fishing employees as 
passengers. Other business employees may carry only other employees of 
that business. The hauling of trailers associated with the conduct of 
commercial fishing or other business activities is authorized.
    (4) Employees of commercial fishermen and/or other businesses who 
apply for access permits shall have the burden of proving, by the 
presentation of appropriate documentation to the refuge manager, that 
they are an ``employee'' for purposes of this section of the 
regulations. Appropriate documentation is defined as the submission of 
standardized and verifiable employment forms including: Signed W-2 and 
W-4 forms, IRS form <greek-i>1099, official earnings statements for 
specified periods, employee income tax withholding submissions to State 
and Federal tax offices (e.g., IRS form W-3 with W-2s attached), State 
unemployment tax information or other proof of actual employment. 
Documentation for each employee must be submitted in advance of access 
being granted, or, for new employees, within 30 days of their starting 
date. Failure to provide verification of employment for new employees 
within 30 days will result in termination of access privileges.
    (k) Suspension or waiver of rules. (1) In an emergency, the refuge 
manager may suspend any or all of the foregoing restrictions on 
vehicular travel and announce each suspension by whatever means are 
available. In the event of adverse weather conditions, the refuge 
manager may close all or any portion of the refuge to vehicular traffic 
for such periods as deemed advisable in the interest of public safety.
    (2) The refuge manager may make exceptions to access restrictions, 
if they are compatible with refuge purposes, for qualified permittees 
who have demonstrated to the refuge manager a need for additional access 
relating to health or livelihood.
    (3) The refuge manager may grant one-time use authorization for 
vehicular access through the refuge to individuals, not otherwise 
qualified above, who have demonstrated to the refuge manager that there 
is no feasible alternative to the access requested. Authorization for 
access under this provision will not be based on convenience to the 
applicant.
    (4) Medical access waiver permits may be issued under the following 
conditions:
    (i) The Regional Director may grant access to non-eligible permanent 
residents who can show proof that their physical health is such that 
life-threatening situations may result from more arduous travel 
conditions. The submission of substantiating medical records is required 
to be considered for a medical access waiver.
    (ii) All medical access waiver permittees will be required to prove 
that their medical condition is or continues to be such that a life-
threatening situation would result from more arduous travel conditions. 
Such proof shall be required prior to the issuance of an access permit, 
and at 3-year intervals thereafter.

pertaining to Back Bay NWR are subject to legal action as prescribed by 
50 CFR 25.43 and part 28, including suspension or revocation of all 
permits issued to the violator or responsible permittee. The refuge 
manager may deny access permits to applicants who, during the 2 years 
immediately preceding the date of application, have formally been 
charged and successfully prosecuted for three or more violations of 
these or other regulations in effect at Back Bay NWR. Individuals whose 
vehicle access privileges are suspended, revoked, or denied may, within 
30 days, file a written appeal of the action to the Assistant Regional 
Director-Refuges and Wildlife, One Gateway Center, Suite 700, Newton 
Corner, Massachusetts 02158, in accordance with 50 CFR 25.45(c).

<R05>
Sec. 26.41  What is the process for determining if a use of a national

wildlife refuge is a compatible use?

    The Refuge Manager will not initiate or permit a new use of a 
national wildlife refuge or expand, renew, or extend an existing use of 
a national wildlife refuge, unless the Refuge Manager has determined 
that the use is a compatible use. This section provides guidelines for 
making compatibility determinations, and procedures for documenting 
compatibility determinations and for periodic review of compatibility 
determinations. We will usually complete compatibility determinations as 
part of the comprehensive conservation plan or step-down management plan 
process for individual uses, specific use programs, or groups of related 
uses described in the plan. We will make all compatibility 
determinations in writing.
    (a) What information do we include in a compatibility determination? 
All compatibility determinations will include the following information:
    (1) The proposed or existing use;
    (2) The name of the national wildlife refuge;
    (3) The authorities used to establish the national wildlife refuge;
    (4) The purpose(s) of the national wildlife refuge;
    (5) The National Wildlife Refuge System mission;

[[Page 206]]

    (6) The nature and extent of the use including the following:
    (i) What is the use? Is the use a priority public use?;
    (ii) Where would the use be conducted?;
    (iii) When would the use be conducted?;
    (iv) How would the use be conducted?; and
    (v) Why is the use being proposed?.
    (7) An analysis of costs for administering and managing each use;
    (8) The anticipated impacts of the use on the national wildlife 
refuge's purposes and the National Wildlife Refuge System mission;
    (9) The amount of opportunity for public review and comment 
provided;
    (10) Whether the use is compatible or not compatible (does it or 
will it materially interfere with or detract from the fulfillment of the 
National Wildlife Refuge System mission or the purpose(s) of the 
national wildlife refuge);
    (11) Stipulations necessary to ensure compatibility;
    (12) A logical explanation describing how the proposed use would, or 
would not, materially interfere with or detract from the fulfillment of 
the National Wildlife Refuge System mission or the purpose(s) of the 
national wildlife refuge;
    (13) The Refuge Manager's signature and date signed; and
    (14) The Regional Chief's concurrence signature and date signed.
    (15) The mandatory 10- or 15-year re-evaluation date.
    (b) Making a use compatible through replacement of lost habitat 
values or other compensatory mitigation. We will not allow compensatory 
mitigation to make a proposed refuge use compatible, except by 
replacement of lost habitat values as provided in paragraph (c) of this 
section. If we cannot make the proposed use compatible with stipulations 
we cannot allow the use.
    (c) Existing right-of-ways. We will not make a compatibility 
determination and will deny any request for maintenance of an existing 
right-of-way which will affect a unit of the National Wildlife Refuge 
System, unless: the design adopts appropriate measures to avoid resource 
impacts and includes provisions to ensure no net loss of habitat 
quantity and quality; restored or replacement areas identified in the 
design are afforded permanent protection as part of the national 
wildlife refuge or wetland management district affected by the 
maintenance; and all restoration work is completed by the applicant 
prior to any title transfer or recording of the easement, if applicable. 
Maintenance of an existing right-of-way includes minor expansion or 
minor realignment to meet safety standards.
    (d) Termination of uses that are not compatible. When we determine 
an existing use is not compatible, we will expeditiously terminate or 
modify the use to make it compatible. Except with written authorization 
by the Director, this process of termination or modification will not 
exceed 6 months from the date that the compatibility determination is 
signed.

<R05>
Sec. 29.1  May we allow economic uses on national wildlife refuges?

    We may only authorize public or private economic use of the natural 
resources of any national wildlife refuge, in accordance with 16 U.S.C. 
715s, where we determine that the use contributes to the achievement of 
the national wildlife refuge purposes or the National Wildlife Refuge 
System mission. We may authorize economic use by appropriate permit only 
when we have determined the use on a national wildlife refuge to be 
compatible. Persons exercising economic privileges on national wildlife 
refuges will be subject to the applicable provisions of this subchapter 
and of other applicable laws and regulations governing national wildlife 
refuges. Permits for economic use will contain such terms and conditions 
that we determine to be necessary for the proper administration of the 
resources. Economic use in this section includes but is not limited to 
grazing livestock, harvesting hay and stock feed, removing timber, 
firewood or other natural products of the soil, removing shell, sand or 
gravel, cultivating areas, or engaging in operations that facilitate 
approved programs on national wildlife refuges.

the affected land should be described in the letter or shown on a map 
sketch. If the requested right-of-way will not adversely affect the

[[Page 216]]

United States' interest, the Regional Director may issue a letter 
stating that the interest of the United States to the right-of-way 
easement would not be affected provided there would be no objection to a 
right-of-way by the fee owner. If the interest of the United States will 
be affected, application for the right-of-way must be submitted in 
accordance with procedures set out in Sec. 29.21-2.
    (c) Other lands outside the National Wildlife Refuge System. Rights-
of-way on or over other lands will be granted in accordance with 
controlling authorities cited in 43 CFR part 2800, or for oil and gas

    (C) Where an application includes both linear and nonlinear 
facilities, payment will be the aggregate of amounts under paragraphs 
(a)(2)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section.
    (D) When an application is received, the Regional Director will 
estimate the costs expected to be incurred in processing the 
application. If the estimated costs exceed the payments under paragraph 
(a)(2)(ii) (A), (B), or (C) of this section by an amount greater than 
the cost of maintaining actual cost records, the Regional Director shall 
require the applicant to make periodic payments in advance of the 
incurrence of such costs by the United States except for the last 
payment which will reflect final reimbursement for actual costs of the 
United States in processing the application. Overpayments may be 
refunded or adjusted by the Regional Director as appropriate.
    (E) The Regional Director shall, on request by an applicant or 
prospective applicant, give an estimate based on the best available cost 
information, of the costs which would be incurred by the United States 
in processing an application. However, reimbursement will not be limited 
to the estimate of the Regional Director if the actual costs exceed the 
estimate. Prospective applicants are encouraged to consult with the 
Regional Director in advance of filing an application in regard to 
probable costs and other requirements.
    (3)(i) By accepting an easement or permit under this subpart, the 
holder agrees to reimburse the United States for reasonable costs 
incurred by the Fish and Wildlife Service in monitoring the

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (B) For nonlinear facilities, $100 for each 40 acres or fraction 
thereof.
    (C) Where an easement or permit includes both linear and nonlinear 
facilities, payment will be the aggregate amounts under paragraph 
(a)(3)(2)(ii) (A) and (B) of this section.
    (D) When an easement or permit is granted the Regional Director 
shall estimate the costs, based on the best available cost information, 
expected to be incurred by the United States in monitoring holder 
activity. If the estimated costs exceed the payments under paragraph 
(a)(3)(2) (ii), (A), (B), or (C) of this section by an amount which is 
greater than the cost of maintaining actual cost records for the 
monitoring process, the Regional Director shall require the holder to 
make periodic payments of the estimated reimbursable costs prior to the 
incurrence of such costs by the United States. Overpayments may be 
refunded or adjusted by the Regional Director as appropriate.
    (E) Following the termination of an easement or permit, the former 
holder will be required to pay additional amounts to the extent the 
actual costs to the United States have exceeded the payments required by 
paragraphs (a)(3)(ii)(A), (B), and (C) of this section.
    (4) All applications filed pursuant to this subpart must include a 
detailed environmental analysis which shall include information 
concerning the impact of the proposed use of the environment including 
the impact on air and water quality; scenic and esthetic features; 
historic, architectural, archeological, and cultural features; wildlife, 
fish and marine life, etc. The analysis shall include sufficient data so 
as to enable the Service to prepare an environmental assessment and/or 
impact statement in accordance with section 102(2)(C) of the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and comply 
with the requirements of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966

Policy Act, the Regional Director may, at his discretion, rely on an 
environmental assessment or impact statement prepared by a ``lead 
agency.''
    (b) Maps. A map or plat must accompany each copy of the application 
and must show the right-of-way in such detail that the right-of-way can 
be accurately located on the ground. Ties to Service land boundary 
corner monuments or some prominent cultural features which can be 
readily recognized and recovered should be shown where the right-of-way 
enters and leaves Service project land together with courses and 
distances of the centerline. The width of the right-of-way on each side 
of the centerline together with the acreage included within the right-
of-way or site must also be shown. If the right-of-way or site is 
located wholly within Service project land, a tie to a Government corner 
or prominent cultural feature which can be readily recognized and 
recovered should be shown.

Sec. 29.21-3  Nature of interest granted.

    (a) Where the land administered by the Secretary is owned in fee by 
the United States and the right-of-way is compatible with the objectives 
of the area, permit or easement may be approved and granted by the 
Regional Director. Generally an easement or permit will be issued for a 
term of 50 years or so long as it is used for the purpose granted, or 
for a lesser term when considered appropriate. For rights-of-way granted 
under authority of section 28 of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, as 
amended, for pipelines for the transportation of oil, natural gas, 
synthetic liquid or gaseous fuels, or any refined product produced 
therefrom, the grant may be for a term not to exceed 30 years and the 
right-of-way may not exceed 50 feet, plus the area occupied by the 
pipeline and its related facilities unless the Regional Director finds, 
and records the reasons for his finding, that, in his judgment, a wider 
right-of-way is necessary for operation and maintenance after 
construction, or to protect the environment or public safety. Related 
facilities include but are not limited to valves, pump stations, 
supporting structures, bridges, monitoring and communication devices, 
surge and storage tanks, terminals, etc. However, a temporary permit 
supplementing a right-of-way may be granted for additional land needed 
during construction, operation, maintenance, or termination of the 
pipeline, or to protect the natural environment or public safety.
    (b) Unless otherwise provided, no interest granted shall give the 
grantee any right whatever to remove any material, earth, or stone for 
construction or other purpose, except that stone or earth necessarily 
removed from the right-of-way in the construction of a project may be 
used elsewhere along the same right-of-way in the construction of the 
same project.

Sec. 29.21-4  Terms and conditions.

    (a) Any right-of-way easement or permit granted will be subject to 
outstanding rights, if any, in third parties.
    (b) An applicant, by accepting an easement or permit agrees to such 
terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the Regional Director in 
the granting document. Such terms and conditions shall include the 
following, unless waived in part by the Regional Director, and may 
include additional special stipulations at his discretion. See Sec. 
29.21-8 for special requirements for electric powerlines and Sec. 
29.21-9 for special requirements for oil and gas pipelines.
    (1) To comply with State and Federal laws applicable to the project 
within which the easement or permit is granted, and to the lands which 
are included

[[Page 219]]

in the right-of-way, and lawful existing regulations thereunder.
    (2) To clear and keep clear the lands within the easement or permit 
area to the extent and in the manner directed by the project manager in 
charge; and to dispose of all vegetative and other material cut, 
uprooted, or otherwise accumulated during the construction and 
maintenance of the project in such a manner as to decrease the fire 
hazard and also in accordance with such instructions as the project 
manager may specify.
    (3) To prevent the disturbance or removal of any public land survey 
monument or project boundary monument unless and until the applicant has 
requested and received from the Regional Director approval of measures 
the applicant will take to perpetuate the location of aforesaid 
monument.
    (4) To take such soil and resource conservation and protection 
measures, including weed control on the land covered by the easement or 
permit as the project manager in charge may request.
    (5) To do everything reasonably within his power, both independently 
and on request of any duly authorized representative of the United 
States, to prevent and suppress fires on or near, lands to be occupied 
under the easement or permit area, including making available such 
construction and maintenance forces as may be reasonably obtainable for 
the suppression of such fires.
    (6) To rebuild and repair such roads, fences, structures, and trails 
as may be destroyed or injured by construction work and upon request by 
the Regional Director, to build and maintain necessary and suitable 
crossings for all roads and trails that intersect the works constructed, 
maintained, or operated under the right-of-way.
    (7) To pay the United States the full value for all damages to the 
lands or other property of the United States caused by him or by his 
employees, contractors, or employees of the contractors, and to 
indemnify the United States against any liability for damages to life, 
person or property arising from the occupancy or use of the lands under 
the easement or permit, except where the easement or permit is granted 
hereunder to a State or other governmental agency which has no legal 
power to assume such a liability with respect to damages caused by it to 
lands or property, such agency in lieu thereof agrees to repair all such 
damages. Where the easement of permit involves lands which are under the 
exclusive jurisdiction of the United States, the holder or his 
employees, contractors, or agents of the contractors, shall be liable to 
third parties for injuries incurred in connection with the easement or 
permit area. Grants of easements or permits involving special hazards 
will impose liability without fault for injury and damage to the land 
and property of the United States up to a specified maximum limit 
commensurate with the foreseeable risks or hazards presented. The amount 
of no-fault liability for each occurrence is hereby limited to no more 
than $1,000,000.
    (8) To notify promptly the project manager in charge of the amount 
of merchantable timber, if any, which will be cut, removed, or destroyed 
in the construction and maintenance of the project, and to pay the 
United States in advance of construction such sum of money as the 
project manager may determine to be the full stumpage value of the 
timber to be so cut, removed, or destroyed.
    (9) That all or any part of the easement or permit granted may be 
terminated by the Regional Director, for failure to comply with any or 
all of the terms or conditions of the grant, or for abandonment. A 
rebuttable presumption of abandonment is raised by deliberate failure of 
the holder to use for any continuous 2-year period the easement or 
permit for the purpose for which it was granted or renewed. In the event 
of noncompliance of abandonment, the Regional Director will notify in 
writing the holder of the easement or permit of his intention to suspend 
or terminate such grant 60 days from the date of the notice, stating the 
reasons therefor, unless prior to that time the holder completes such 
corrective actions as are specified in the notice. The Regional Director 
may grant an extension of time within which to complete corrective 
actions when, in his judgment, extenuating circumstances not

[[Page 220]]

within the holder's control such as adverse weather conditions, 
disturbance to wildlife during breeding periods or periods of peak 
concentration, or other compelling reasons warrant. Should the holder of 
a right-of-way issued under authority of the Mineral Leasing Act, as 
amended, fail to take corrective action within the 60-day period, the 
Regional Director will provide for an administrative proceeding pursuant 
to 5 U.S.C. 554, prior to a final Departmental decision to suspend or 
terminate the easement or permit. In the case of all other right-of-way 
holders, failure to take corrective action within the 60-day period will 
result in a determination by the Regional Director to suspend or 
terminate the easement or permit. No administrative proceeding shall be 
required where the easement or permit terminates under its terms.
    (10) To restore the land to its original condition to the 
satisfaction of the Regional Director so far as it is reasonably 
possible to do so upon revocation and/or termination of the easement or 
permit, unless this requirement is waived in writing by the Regional 
Director. Termination also includes permits or easements that terminate 
under the terms of the grant.
    (11) To keep the project manager informed at all times of his 
address, and, in case of corporations, of the address of its principal 
place of business and the names and addresses of its principal officers.
    (12) That in the construction, operation, and maintenance of the 
project, he shall not discriminate against any employee or applicant for 
employment because of race, creed, color, or national origin and shall 
require an identical provision to be included in all subcontracts.
    (13) That the grant of the easement or permit shall be subject to 
the express condition that the exercise thereof will not unduly 
interfere with the management, administration, or disposal by the United 
States of the land affected thereby. The applicant agrees and consents 
to the occupancy and use by the United States, its grantees, permittees, 
or lessees of any part of the easement of permit area not actually 
occupied for the purpose of the granted rights to the extent that it 
does not interfere with the full and safe utilization thereof by the 
holder. The holder of an easement or permit also agrees that authorized 
representatives of the United States shall have the right of access to 
the easement or permit area for the purpose of making inspections and 
monitoring the construction, operation and maintenance of facilities.
    (14) That the easement or permit herein granted shall be subject to 
the express covenant that any facility constructed thereon will be 
modified or adapted, if such is found by the Regional Director to be 
necessary, without liability or expense to the United States, so that 
such facility will not conflict with the use and occupancy of the land 
for any authorized works which may hereafter be constructed thereon 
under the authority of the United States. Any such modification will be 
planned and scheduled so as not to interfere unduly with or to have 
minimal effect upon continuity of energy and delivery requirements.
    (15) That the easement or permit herein granted shall be for the 
specific use described and may not be construed to include the further 
right to authorize any other use within the easement or permit area 
unless approved in writing by the Regional Director.

Sec. 29.21-5  Construction.

    (a) If construction is not commenced within two (2) years after date 
of right-of-way grant, the right-of-way may be canceled by the Director 
of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service at his discretion.
    (b) Proof of construction: Upon completion of construction, the 
applicant shall file a certification of completion with the Regional 
Director.

[42 FR 43919, Aug. 31, 1977]


<R05>
Sec. 29.21-6  Disposal, transfer or termination of interest.

    (a) Change in jurisdiction over and disposal of lands. The final 
disposal by the United States of any tract of land traversed by a right-
of-way shall not be construed to be a revocation of the right-of-way in 
whole or in part, but such final disposition shall be deemed

[[Page 221]]

and taken to be subject to such right-of-way unless it has been 
specifically canceled.
    (b) Transfer of easement or permit. Any proposed transfer, by 
assignment, lease, operating agreement or otherwise, of an easement or 
permit must be filed in triplicate with the Regional Director and must 
be supported by a stipulation that the transferee agrees to comply with 
and be bound by the terms and conditions of the original grant. A $25 
nonreturnable service fee must accompany the proposal. No transfer will 
be recognized unless and until approved in writing by the Regional 
Director.
    (c) Disposal of property on termination of right-of-way. In the 
absence of any agreement to the contrary, the holder of the right-of-way 
will be allowed 6 months after termination to remove all property or 
improvements other than a road and useable improvements to a road, 
placed thereon by him; otherwise, all such property and improvements 
shall become the property of the United States. Extensions of time may 
be granted at the discretion of the Regional Director.

<R05>
Sec. 29.21-7  What payment do we require for use and occupancy of

national wildlife refuge lands?

    (a) Payment for use and occupancy of lands under the regulations of 
this subpart will be required and will be for fair market value as 
determined by appraisal by the Regional Director. At the discretion of 
the Regional Director, the payment may be a lump sum payment or an 
annual fair market rental payment, to be made in advance. If any 
Federal, State or local agency is exempted from such payment by and any 
other provision of Federal law, such agency shall otherwise compensate 
the Service by any other means agreeable to the Regional Director, 
including, but not limited to, making other land available or the loan 
of equipment or personnel, except that any such compensation shall 
relate to, and be consistent with the objectives of the National 
Wildlife Refuge System. The Regional Director may waive such requirement 
for compensation if he finds such requirement impracticable or 
unnecessary.
    (b) When annual rental payments are used, such rates shall be 
reviewed by the Regional Director at any time not less than 5 years 
after the grant of the permit, right-of-way, or easement or the last 
revision of charges thereunder, The Regional Director will furnish a 
notice in writing to the holder of an easement or permit of intent to 
impose new charges to reflect fair market value commencing with the 
ensuing charge year. The revised charges will be effective unless the 
holder files an appeal in accordance with Sec. 29.22.

Sec. 29.21-8  Electric power transmission line rights-of-way.

    By accepting a right-of-way for a power transmission line, the 
applicant thereby agrees and consents to comply with and be bound by the 
following terms and conditions, except those which the Secretary may 
waive in a particular case, in addition to those specified in Sec. 
29.21-4(b).
    (a) To protect in a workmanlike manner, at crossings and at places 
in proximity to his transmission lines on the right-of-way authorized, 
in accordance with the rules prescribed in the National Electric Safety 
Code, all Government and other telephone, telegraph and power 
transmission lines from contact and all highways and railroads from 
obstruction and to maintain his transmission lines in such manner as not 
to menace life or property.
    (b) Neither the privilege nor the right to occupy or use the lands 
for the purpose authorized shall relieve him of any legal liability for 
causing inductive or conductive interference between any project 
transmission line or other project works constructed, operated, or 
maintained by him on the servient lands, and any radio installation, 
telephone line, or other communication facilities now or hereafter 
constructed and operated by the United States or any agency thereof.

Sec. 29.21-9  Rights-of-way for pipelines for the transportation of

oil, natural gas, synthetic liquid or gaseous fuels, or any refined
product produced 
          therefrom.

    (a) Application procedure. Applications for pipelines and related 
facilities under this section are to be filed in accordance with Sec. 
29.21-2 of these regulations with the following exception:

    When the right-of-way or proposed facility will occupy Federal land 
under the control of more than one Federal Agency and/or more than one 
bureau or office of the Department of the Interior, a single application 
shall be filed with the appropriate State Director of the Bureau of Land 
Management in accordance with regulations in 43 CFR part 2800.

    Any portion of the facility occupying land of the National Wildlife 
Refuge System will be subject to the provisions of these regulations.
    (b) Right-of-way grants under this section will be subject to the 
special requirements of section 28 of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 
(30 U.S.C. 185), as amended, as set forth below. Gathering lines and 
associated structures used solely in the production of oil and gas under 
valid leases on the lands administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service 
are excepted from the provisions of this section.
    (1) Pipeline safety. Rights-of-way or permits granted under this 
section will include requirements that will protect the safety of 
workers and protect the public from sudden ruptures and slow degradation 
of the pipeline. An applicant must agree to design, construct, and 
operate all proposed facilities in accordance with the provisions of 
parts 192 and/or 195 of title 49 of the CFR and in accordance with the 
Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, Pub. L. 91-596, including 
any amendments thereto.
    (2) Environmental protection. An application for a right-of-way must 
contain environmental information required by Sec. 29.21-2(a)(4) of 
this subpart. If the Regional Director determines that a proposed 
project will have a significant affect on the environment, there must 
also be furnished a plan of construction, operations, and rehabilitation 
of the proposed facilities. In addition to terms and conditions imposed 
under Sec. 29.21-4, the Regional director will impose such stipulations 
as may be required to assure: (i) Restoration, revegetation and 
curtailment of erosion of the surface; (ii) that activities in 
connection with the right-of-way or permit will not violate applicable 
air and water quality standards in related facilities siting standards 
established by law; (iii) control or prevention of damage to the 
environment including damage to fish and wildlife habitat, public or 
private property, and public health and safety; and (iv) protection of 
the interests of individuals living in the general area of the right-of-
way or permit who rely on the fish, wildlife, and biotic resources of 
the area for subsistence purposes.
    (c) Disclosure. If the applicant is a partnership, corporation, 
association, or other business entity it must disclose the identity of 
the participants in the entity. Such disclosure shall include where 
applicable (1) the name and address of each partner, (2) the name and 
address of each shareholder owning 3 percentum or more of the shares, 
together with the number and percentage of any class of voting shares of 
the entity which such shareholder is authorized to vote, and (3) the 
name and address of each affiliate of the entity together with, in the 
case of an affiliate controlled by the entity, the number of shares and 
the percentage of any class of voting stock of that affiliate owned, 
directly or indirectly, by that entity, and in the case of an affiliate 
which controls that entity, the number of shares and the percentage of 
any class of voting stock of that entity owned, directly or indirectly, 
by the affiliate.
    (d) Technical and financial capability. The Regional Director may 
grant or renew a right-of-way or permit under this section only when he 
is satisfied that the applicant has the technical and financial 
capability to construct, operate, maintain and terminate the facility. 
At the discretion of the Regional Director, a financial statement may be 
required.
    (e) Reimbursement of costs. In accordance with Sec. 29.21-2(a)(3) 
of this subpart, the holder of a right-of-way or permit must reimburse 
the Service for the cost incurred in monitoring the construction, 
operation, maintenance, and

[[Page 223]]

termination of any pipeline or related facilities as determined by the 
Regional Director.
    (f) Public hearing. The Regional Director shall give notice to 
Federal, State, and local government agencies, and the public, and 
afford them the opportunity to comment on right-of-way applications 
under this section. A notice will be published in the Federal Register 
and a public hearing may be held where appropriate.
    (g) Bonding. Where appropriate the Regional Director may require the 
holder of a right-of-way or permit to furnish a bond, or other security 
satisfactory to him, to secure all or any of the obligations imposed by 
the terms and conditions of the right-of-way or permit or by any rule or 
regulation, not to exceed the period of construction plus one year or a 
longer period if necessary for the pipeline to stabilize.
    (h) Suspension of right-of-way. If the Project Manager determines 
that an immediate temporary suspension of activities within a right-of-
way or permit area is necessary to protect public health and safety or 
the environment, he may issue an emergency suspension order to abate 
such activities prior to an administrative proceeding. The Regional 
Director must make a determination and notify the holder in writing 
within 15 days from the date of suspension as to whether the suspension 
should continue and list actions needed to terminate the suspension. 
Such suspension shall remain in effect for only so long as an emergency 
condition continues.
    (i) Joint use of rights-of-way. Each right-of-way or permit shall 
reserve to the Regional Director the right to grant additional rights-
of-way or permits for compatible uses on or adjacent to rights-of-way or 
permit areas granted under this section after giving notice to the 
holder and an opportunity to comment.
    (j) Common carriers. (1) Pipelines and related facilities used for 
the transportation of oil, natural gas, synthetic liquid or gaseous 
fuels, or any refined product produced therefrom shall be constructed, 
operated, and maintained as common carriers.
    (2)(i) The owners or operators of pipelines subject to this subpart 
shall accept, convey, transport, or purchase without discrimination all 
oil or gas delivered to the pipeline without regard to whether such oil 
or gas was produced on Federal or non-Federal lands.
    (ii) In the case of oil or gas produced from Federal lands or from 
the resources on the Federal lands in the vicinity of the pipelines, the 
Secretary may, after a full hearing with due notice thereof to the 
interested parties and a proper finding of facts, determine the 
proportionate amounts to be accepted, conveyed, transported or 
purchased.
    (3)(i) The common carrier provisions of this section shall not apply 
to any natural gas pipeline operated by any person subject to regulation 
under the Natural Gas Act or by any public utility subject to regulation 
by a State or municipal regulatory agency having jurisdiction to 
regulate the rates and charges for the sale of natural gas to consumers 
within the State or municipality.
    (ii) Where natural gas not subject to state regulatory or 
conservation laws governing its purchase by pipelines is offered for 
sale, each such pipeline shall purchase, without discrimination, any 
such natural gas produced in the vicinity of the pipeline.
    (4) The Regional Director shall require, prior to granting or 
renewing a right-of-way, that the applicant submit and disclose all 
plans, contracts, agreements, or other information or material which he 
deems necessary to determine whether a right-of-way shall be granted or 
renewed and the terms and conditions which should be included in the 
right-of-way. Such information may include, but is not limited to: (i) 
Conditions for, and agreements among owners or operators, regarding the 
addition of pumping facilities, looping, or otherwise increasing the 
pipeline or terminal's throughput capacity in response to actual or 
anticipated increases in demand; (ii) conditions for adding or 
abandoning intake, offtake, or storage points or facilities; and (iii) 
minimum shipment or purchase tenders.
    (k) Limitations on export. Any domestically produced crude oil 
transported by pipeline over rights-of-way granted

[[Page 224]]

pursuant to section 28 of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, except such 
crude oil which is either exchanged in similar quantity for convenience 
or increased efficiency of transportation with persons or the government 
of an adjacent foreign state, or which is temporarily exported for 
convenience or increased efficiency of transportation across parts of an 
adjacent foreign state and reenters the United States, shall be subject 
to all of the limitation and licensing requirements of the Export 
Administration Act of 1969.
    (l) State standards. The Regional Director shall take into 
consideration, and to the extent practical comply with, applicable State 
standards for right-of-way construction, operation, and maintenance.
    (m) Congressional notification. The Secretary shall notify the House 
and Senate Committees on Interior and Insular Affairs promptly upon 
receipt of an application for a right-of-way for pipeline 24 inches or 
more in diameter, and no right-of-way for such a pipeline shall be 
granted until 60 days (not including days on which the House or Senate 
has adjourned for more than three days) after a notice of intention to 
grant the right-of-way together with the Secretary's detailed findings 
as to terms and conditions he proposes to impose, has been submitted to 
the Committees, unless each Committee by resolution waives the waiting 
period.

Sec. 29.32  Mineral rights reserved and excepted.

    Persons holding mineral rights in wildlife refuge lands by 
reservation in the conveyance to the United States and persons holding 
mineral rights in such lands which rights vested prior to the 
acquisition of the lands by the United States shall, to the greatest 
extent practicable, conduct all exploration, development, and production 
operations in such a manner as to prevent damage, erosion, pollution, or 
contamination to the lands, waters, facilities and vegetation of the 
area. So far as is practicable, such operations must also be conducted 
without interference with the operation of the refuge or disturbance to 
the wildlife thereon. Physical occupancy of the area must be kept to the 
minimum space compatible with the conduct of efficient mineral 
operations. Persons conducting mineral operations on refuge areas must 
comply with all applicable Federal and State laws and regulations for 
the protection of wildlife and the administration of the area. Oil field 
brine, slag, and all other waste and contaminating substances must be 
kept in the smallest practicable area, must be confined so as to prevent 
escape as a result of rains and high water or otherwise, and must be 
removed from the area as quickly as practicable in such a manner as to 
prevent contamination, pollution, damage, or injury to the lands, 
waters, facilities, or vegetation of the refuge or to wildlife. 
Structures and equipment must be removed from the area when the need for 
them has ended. Upon the cessation of operations the area shall be 
restored as nearly as possible to its condition prior to the 
commencement of operations. Nothing in this section shall be applied so 
as to contravene or nullify rights vested in holders of mineral 
interests on refuge lands.

                      Subpart A_General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 32.1  Opening of wildlife refuge areas to hunting.

    The opening of a wildlife refuge area to hunting will be dependent 
upon the provisions of law applicable to the area and upon a 
determination by the Secretary that the opening of the area to the 
hunting of migratory game birds, upland game, or big game will be 
compatible with the principles of sound wildlife management and will 
otherwise be in the public interest. The opening or closing of wildlife 
refuge areas to hunting shall be in accordance with the rulemaking 
requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553). Lands 
acquired pursuant to the Act of May 18, 1948 (62 Stat. 238, 16 U.S.C. 
695) will be opened to hunting only after it has been determined that 
the major portion of the crops in the vicinity of the area involved have 
been harvested, that the period of susceptibility of such crops to 
wildfowl depredation has passed, or that the possibility of these crops 
being damaged by waterfowl is minor. Lands acquired as ``waterfowl 
production areas'' shall annually be open to the hunting of migratory 
game birds, upland game, and big game subject to the provisions of State 
law and regulations and the pertinent provisions of parts 25 through 31 
of this subchapter: Provided, That all forms of hunting or entry on all 
or any part of individual areas may be temporarily suspended by posting 
upon occasions of unusual or critical conditions of, or affecting land, 
water, vegetation, or wildlife populations.


<R05>
Sec. 32.2  What are the requirements for hunting on areas of the

National Wildlife Refuge System?

    The following provisions shall apply to each person while engaged in 
public hunting on areas of the National Wildlife Refuge System:
    (a) Each person shall secure and possess the required State license.

[[Page 228]]

    (b) Each person 16 years of age and older shall secure and possess a 
Migratory Bird Hunting Stamp while hunting migratory waterfowl.
    (c) Each person shall comply with the applicable provisions of 
Federal law and regulations including this subchapter and the current 
Federal Migratory Bird Regulations.
    (d) Each person shall comply with the applicable provisions of the 
laws and regulations of the State wherein any area is located unless 
further restricted by Federal law or regulation.
    (e) Each person shall comply with the terms and conditions 
authorizing access or use of wildlife refuges, including the terms and 
conditions under which hunting permits are issued.
    (f) Each person must comply with the provisions of any refuge-
specific regulations governing hunting on the wildlife refuge area. 
Regulations, special conditions, and maps of the hunting areas for a 
particular wildlife refuge are available at that area's headquarters. In 
addition, refuge-specific hunting regulations for migratory game bird, 
upland game, and big game hunting appear in Sec. Sec. 32.20 through 
32.72.
    (g) The use of any drug on any arrow for bow hunting on national 
wildlife refuges is prohibited. Archers may not have arrows employing 
such drugs in their possession on any national wildlife refuge.
    (h) The unauthorized distribution of bait and the hunting over bait 
is prohibited on wildlife refuge areas. (Baiting is authorized in 
accordance with State regulations on national wildlife refuges in 
Alaska).
    (i) The use of nails, wire, screws or bolts to attach a stand to a 
tree, or hunting from a tree into which a metal object has been driven 
to support a hunter is prohibited on wildlife refuge areas.
    (j) The use or possession of alcoholic beverages while hunting is 
prohibited.
    (k) You may possess only approved nontoxic shot while in the field, 
which we identify in 50 CFR 20.21(j), while on Waterfowl Production 
Areas, or on certain other areas of the National Wildlife Refuge System 
as delineated on maps, leaflets and/or signs, available at each refuge 
headquarters or posted at each refuge, or as stated in refuge-specific 
regulations. Where we allow turkey and deer hunting, you may use slugs 
and shot containing lead to hunt these species unless prohibited by 
refuge-specific regulations and/or State law.
    (l) The refuge-specific regulations (Sec. 32.20 through Sec. 
32.72) may include the items discussed in Sec. 32.3(b). Refuge permits 
and brochures should also include those items and any special conditions 
allowed by paragraph (f) of this section.

State establishes its hunting seasons by publication through one or more 
of the methods identified in Sec. 25.31 of this subchapter C.
    (f) Refuge-specific hunting regulations may be amended or new 
conditions imposed at any time during the hunting season when

fishing subject to the provisions of State laws and regulations and the 
pertinent provisions of parts 25 through 31 of this subchapter: 
Provided, that fishing or entry on all or any part of individual areas 
may be temporarily suspended by posting upon occasions of unusual or

and wildlife populations.


<R05>
Sec. 32.5  What are the requirements for sportfishing on areas of

    (d) Each person shall comply with the terms and conditions 
authorizing access and use of the wildlife refuge area.

assignments during a lottery drawing at the conclusion of the training. 
The 11 blind sites are available exclusively to these junior waterfowl 
hunters and their mentors the first 4 Saturdays and Sundays of the duck 
season.

junior waterfowl hunters, they will vie for blind site assignments 
during a lottery drawing at the conclusion of the annual junior 
waterfowl hunter training for the use of blind sites in the junior hunt 
area on the first Wednesday following the second weekend of the season. 
This day is known as Mentor Day. We will collect no fee from mentors for 
this hunt day. We will make available blinds not assigned because of 
this lottery to other adult hunters via a preseason lottery.

[[Page 444]]


<R05>
Sec. 34.2  Authority.

    (a) The Act of October 17, 1978, Pub. L. 95-469, amended the Act of 
June 15, 1935, as amended by the Act of August 30, 1964 (78 Stat. 701;

sharing provisions to all fee and reserve areas that are administered 
solely or primarily by the Secretary through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service. Payments under this Act may be used for any governmental 
purpose.
    (b) Pursuant to title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (78 Stat. 
252; 42 U.S.C. 2000d), and the regulations issued pursuant thereto, 
which are contained in 43 CFR part 17, counties must file an assurance

with regulations contained in 43 CFR part 17 in order to continue to 
receive this Federal financial assistance.


<R05>
Sec. 34.3  Definitions.

    (a) The term fee area means any area which was acquired in fee by 
the United States and is administered, either solely or primarily, by 
the Secretary through the Service.
    (b) The term reserve area means any area of land withdrawn from the 
public domain and administered, either solely or primarily, by the 
Secretary through the Service. For the purpose of these regulations, 
reserve areas also include lands in Hawaii, the Commonwealth of Puerto 
Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands, which were initially administered by 
the United States through Act of Congress, Executive Order, Public Land 
Order or Proclamation of the President and administered, either solely 
or primarily, by the Secretary through the Service.
    (c) The term county means any county, parish, organized or 
unorganized borough, township or municipality, or other unit of local 
government that is the primary collector for general purpose real 
property taxes where fee areas and/or reserve areas are located. For the 
purpose of sharing revenues, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, and 
the Virgin Islands shall each be treated as a county.
    (d) The term fund means the revenues received by the Service from 
(1) the sale or disposition of animals, salmonoid carcasses and eggs, 
products of the soil (including, but not limited to, timber, hay, and 
grass), minerals, shells, sand, and gravel; (2) leases for public 
accommodations or facilities incidental to, but not in conflict with, 
the basic purpose of such areas; and (3) other privileges, including 
industrial leases at Crab Orchard National Wildlife Refuge, Illinois, as 
authorized by Section 8 of Pub. L. 95-616, approved October 27, 1978. 
The Service may pay from such fund any necessary expenses incurred in 
connection with the revenue producing and revenue sharing activity. The 
fund shall also include any appropriations authorized by the Act to make 
up any difference between the total amount of receipts after payments of 
expenses and the total amount of payments due the counties.
    (e) The term net receipts means the amount of revenue collected by 
the Service from an area (including fee land and/or reserve land) after 
the deduction of necessary expenses incurred in producing the particular 
revenues.

for which in all probability a property would be sold if exposed for 
sale in the open market by a seller who is willing but not obligated to 
sell, allowing a reasonable time to find a buyer who is willing but not 
obligated to buy, both parties having full knowledge of all the uses to 
which the property is adapted, and for which it is capable of being 
used.


<R05>
Sec. 34.4  Eligibility of areas.

    In order to receive payments under the Act, a county must qualify 
under the definition in Sec. 34.3(c) of this part and there must be 
located within the county, areas of land owned in fee title by the 
United States and administered by the Secretary of the Interior through 
the Fish and Wildlife Service, including wildlife refuges, waterfowl 
production areas, wildlife ranges, wildlife management areas, fish 
hatcheries, research centers or stations, and administrative sites, and 
these areas must be solely or primarily administered by the Service. In 
addition to this Act, reserve areas administered solely or primarily by 
the Service are

[[Page 445]]

entitlement lands under section 6(a) of the Act of October 29, 1976 
(Pub. L. 94-565, 31 U.S.C. 1601-1607), for which regulations are 
published in title 43, part 1880, Code of Federal Regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 34.5  Distribution of revenues.

    The Act provides that the Secretary, at the end of each fiscal year, 
shall pay to each county out of the fund:
    (a) For reserve areas, an amount equal to 25 per centum of the net 
receipts, collected by the Secretary in connection with the operation 
and management of such area, provided that when any such area is 
situated in more than one county, the distributive share to each from 
the aforesaid receipts shall be proportional to its acreage of such 
reserve area.
    (b) For fee areas, whichever of the following is greater:
    (1) An amount equal to 75[cent] per acre for the total acreage of 
the fee area located within such county.
    (2) An amount equal to three-fourths of one per centum of the fair 
market value, as determined by the Secretary, of that portion of the fee 
area (excluding any improvements thereto made after the date of Federal 
acquisition) which is located within such county. For those areas of fee 
land within the National Wildlife Refuge System as of September 30, 
1977, the amount of payment based on fair market value will not be less 
than the amount paid on the adjusted cost basis as in effect at that 
time. Actual cost, or appraised value in case of donation, will be used 
for lands acquired during fiscal year 1978. For those areas of fee lands 
added to lands administered by the Service after September 30, 1978, by 
purchase, donation, or otherwise, fair market value shall be determined 
by appraisal as of the date said areas are administered by the Service.
    (3) An amount equal to 25 per centum of the net receipts collected 
by the Secretary in connection with the operation and management of such 
fee area during such fiscal year; but if a fee area is located in two or 
more counties, the amount each such county is entitled to shall be the 
amount which bears to such 25 per centum, the same ratio as that portion 
of the fee area acreage which is within such county bears to the total 
acreage of such fee area.
    (c) In accordance with section 5(A) of the act, each county which 
receives a payment under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, with 
respect to any fee area or reserve area, shall distribute that payment 
to those units of local government which have incurred the loss or 
reduction of real property tax revenues because of the existence of such 
area in accordance with the following guidelines.

The local units of government entitled to this distribution will be 
those such as, but not limited to, cities, towns, townships, school 
districts, and the county itself in appropriate cases, which levy and 
collect real property taxes separately from the county or other primary 
taxing authority or those for which a tax is separately stated on a 
consolidated tax bill of the primary taxing authority in areas wherein 
eligible lands are located. The amount of distribution or passthrough to 
which each unit of local government shall be entitled shall be in the 
same proportion as its current tax loss bears to the current whole tax 
loss.

This proportion may be determined; from representative tax bills for the 
area; by construction by using assessments and millage rates; or by 
other suitable methods to achieve an equitable result. An example using 
the representative tax bill method is:

                      Typical Tax Bill for the Area
County...................................  $80 or 80%
School District..........................  20 or 20%
                                          ------------------------------
 Total...................................  $100 or 100%
 

    The county would receive the total payment, keep 80 percent and pass 
through 20 percent to the school district. An example using the 
construction method is:

                           For a Typical Acre
Assessed value--
  $100x80 mills County..................................      $8     80%
  $100x20 mills School District.........................      $2     20%
                                                         ---------------
 Total..................................................     $10    100%
 

    Here again, the county would receive the total payment, keep 80 
percent and pass through 20 percent to the school district.


Counties shall distribute the payment to eligible local units of 
government

[[Page 446]]

within 90 days from receipt of the payment. In the event a county cannot 
make the required distribution for reasons of State or local law, or 
otherwise, the Service will make the payments directly to local units of 
government upon return of the check and information upon which to make 
the payments.
    (d) Each county which receives a payment under these regulations 
shall maintain a record for a period of three years as to how the 
payment was distributed to units of local government under paragraph (c) 
of this section. The record shall be available for inspection by the 
regional director, should a dispute arise as to the distribution of 
payments. See Sec. 29.21-2(c) for a listing of the regional directors 
of the Service.


<R05>
Sec. 34.6  Schedule of appraisals.

    The Secretary shall make fair market value appraisals of areas 
administered by the Service within five years after October 17, 1978, 
beginning with areas established earliest. All areas for which payments 
were not authorized prior to fiscal year 1979 (i.e.; fish hatcheries, 
administrative sites, and research stations) shall be included in the 
areas appraised during the first fiscal year. Once appraised, areas 
shall be reappraised on a schedule of at least once every five years. 
Until areas are appraised, the fair market value for the purposes of 
this regulation shall be the adjusted cost as of September 30, 1978, 
except that fee lands added to such areas after that date shall be on 
the basis of fair market value.


<R05>
Sec. 34.7  Fair market value appraisals.

    Fee areas administered by the Service will be appraised in 
accordance with standard appraisal procedures in order to estimate the 
fair market value of each area as a whole. The evaluation will be 
premised on an appropriate determination of highest and best use in 
accordance with existing or potential zoning, the present condition of 
the land and the general economic situation in the vicinity. Standard 
appraisal techniques will involve a market data comparison of these 
areas with similar properties which have sold recently in the local 
market. These techniques may also include consideration of potential 
income and development of the cost approach for special use properties 
having limited marketability. An appropriate evaluation of these areas 
will also take into consideration a discount for size as recognized by 
the market for large properties where applicable. The appraisals will be 
accomplished by the regional director, using Service staff appraisers or 
private appraisers contracted by the Service.

The Act requires that improvements placed upon the land after the date 
of Federal Acquisition be excluded from the fair market value. The only 
structures that will be included in the appraisal are those that were 
present at the time of Federal acquisition and have not been the subject 
of substantial renovation or modification with Federal funds. Evaluation 
of improvements will be based on their contributory value to the area as 
determined by the highest and best use study. Lands occupied by 
improvements not subject to appraisal will be valued as though 
unimproved.

The appraisals will be reviewed by the Service's review appraisers and 
the determination of the regional director as to fair market value shall 
be final and conclusive and shall be the basis for computation of 
revenue sharing payments.


<R05>
Sec. 34.8  Appropriations authorized.

    The Act authorizes appropriations to the fund for any fiscal year 
when the aggregate amount of payments required to be made exceeds the 
net receipts in the fund.


<R05>
Sec. 34.9  Protests.

    (a) Computation of payments shall be based on Federal records 
concerning land, real property improvements, and accounting of net 
receipts from areas administered solely or primarily by the Service.
    (b) Any affected county may protest the results of the computations 
of its payments to the regional director in charge of the State and 
county affected. See Sec. 29.21-2(c) for a listing of the regional 
directors of the Service.
    (c) Any protesting county shall submit sufficient evidence to show 
error in the computation or the data from which the computations are 
made.

[[Page 447]]

    (d) All protests to the regional director shall be filed within 90 
days from the date of receipt of the payment.
    (e) The regional director shall consult with the affected county to 
resolve conflicts in the computations and/or data. The regional director 
shall make a determination as to the correct payment, which 
determination shall be final and conclusive.

<R05>
Sec. 35.1  Definitions.

    As used in the rules and regulations in this subchapter:
    National Wildlife Refuge System means all lands, waters, and 
interests therein administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as 
national wildlife refuges, wildlife ranges, game ranges, wildlife 
management areas, waterfowl production areas, and areas for the 
protection and conservation of fish and wildlife which are threatened 
with extinction.
    National Wilderness Preservation System means the units designated 
as wilderness by the Congress under the provisions of the Wilderness Act 
(supra).
    Wilderness Units shall mean areas in the National Wildlife Refuge 
System that have been designated by Act of Congress as units of the 
National Wilderness Preservation System.
    Secretary means the Secretary of the Interior.
    Director means the Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.


<R05>
Sec. 35.2  Objectives.

    (a) Units of the National Wildlife Refuge System have been 
established by divers legal means and are administered for a variety of 
wildlife program purposes. The establishment of each wilderness unit is 
within and supplemental to the purposes for which a specific unit of the 
National Wildlife Refuge System was established and is administered. 
Each wilderness shall be administered for such other purposes for which 
the national wildlife refuge was established and shall be also 
administered to preserve its wilderness character.
    (b) Except as otherwise provided by law, wilderness areas shall be 
devoted to the public purposes of recreational, scenic, scientific, 
educational, conservation, and historical use and shall be administered 
in such a manner as will leave them unimpaired for future use and 
enjoyment as wilderness.


<R05>
Sec. 35.3  General regulations.

    Rules and regulations governing administration of the National 
Wildlife Refuge System will apply to wilderness units where said rules 
and regulations do not conflict with provisions of the Wilderness Act or 
Act of Congress which establishes the wilderness unit.


<R05>
Sec. 35.4  Appropriations and personnel.

    No appropriation shall be made available for the payment of expenses 
or salaries for the administration of a wilderness unit as a separate 
entity nor shall any appropriation be made available for additional 
personnel solely for the purpose of managing or administering areas 
because they are included within the National Wilderness Preservation 
System.

[[Page 448]]


<R05>
Sec. 35.5  Commercial enterprises, roads, motor vehicles, motorized

equipment, motorboats, aircraft, mechanical transport, structures, and 
installations.

    Except as specifically provided and subject to existing private 
rights, there shall be no commercial enterprise and no permanent road 
within a wilderness unit, and except as necessary to meet minimum 
requirements for the administration of the area (including measures 
required in emergencies involving the health and safety of persons 
within the area), there shall be no temporary road, no use of motor 
vehicles, motorized equipment or motorboats, no landing of aircraft, no 
other form of mechanized transport, and no structure or installation 
within any such area.
    (a) The Director may authorize occupancy and use of a national 
wildlife refuge by officers, employees, agencies, and agents of Federal, 
State, and county governments to carry out the purposes of the 
Wilderness Act and the Act establishing the wilderness and will 
prescribe conditions under which motorized equipment, mechanical 
transport, aircraft, motorboats, installations, or structures may be 
used to meet the minimum requirements for authorized activities to 
protect and administer the wilderness. The Director may also prescribe 
the conditions under which such equipment, transport, aircraft, 
installations, or structures may be used in emergencies involving the 
health and safety of persons, damage to property, violations of civil 
and criminal law, or other purposes.
    (b) The Director may permit, subject to such restrictions as he 
deems desirable, the landing of aircraft and the use of motorized 
equipment at places within a wilderness where such uses were established 
prior to the date the wilderness was designated by Act of Congress as a 
unit of the National Wilderness Preservation System.


<R05>
Sec. 35.6  Public use.

    Public uses of a wilderness unit will be in accordance with the 
purposes for which the individual national wildlife refuge was 
established and is administered and laws and regulations governing 
public uses within the National Wildlife Refuge System.
    (a) When public uses are authorized within a wilderness unit, the 
Refuge Manager may regulate such use. Regulating will include limiting 
the numbers of persons allowed in the wilderness at a given time, 
imposing restrictions on time, seasons, kinds and location of public 
uses, requiring a permit or reservation to visit the area, and similar 
actions.
    (b) All persons entering a wilderness unit will be required to 
remove such materials as they carry in.
    (c) Informational signs for the convenience of visitors will not be 
permitted in a wilderness unit; however, rustic directional signs for 
vistor safety may be installed in locations appropriate to a wilderness 
setting.
    (d) Limited public use facilities and improvements may be provided 
as necessary for the protection of the refuge and wilderness and for 
public safety. Facilities and improvements will not be provided for the 
comfort and convenience of wilderness visitors.
    (e) Public services and temporary structures generally offered by 
packers, outfitters, and guides for realizing the recreational or other 
wilderness purposes of a wilderness may be permitted. Temporary 
installations and structures which existed for these subsistence 
purposes under valid special use permit or easement when the wilderness 
was established may be continued if their use is necessary to administer 
the refuge for the purposes for which it was established and for 
wilderness purposes. The number, nature, and extent of such temporary 
structures and services will be controlled through regulations and 
special use permits issued by the Refuge Manager so as to provide 
maximum protection of wilderness resources and values.
    (f) Hunting and fishing in a refuge wilderness will be in accordance 
with Federal and State regulations including special regulations for the 
specific wildlife refuge. Hunting or fishing which requires motorized 
equipment will not be permitted except as provided in Sec. 35.5(a) and 
(b).

[[Page 449]]


<R05>
Sec. 35.7  Control of wildfires, insects, pest plants, and disease.

    To the extent necessary, the Director shall prescribe measures to 
control wildfires, insects, pest plants, and disease to prevent 
unacceptable loss of wilderness resources and values, loss of life, and 
damage to property.


<R05>
Sec. 35.8  Forest management.

    Forest management activities in a wilderness unit will be directed 
toward allowing natural ecological processes to operate freely. 
Commercial harvesting of timber shall not be permitted except where 
necessary to control attacks of insects or disease as prescribed in 
Sec. 35.7.


<R05>
Sec. 35.9  Livestock grazing.

    (a) The grazing of livestock, where established prior to the date of 
legislation which designates a wilderness unit, may be permitted to 
continue subject to part 29 of this subchapter and in accordance with 
special provisions which may be prescribed for individual units. Numbers 
of permitted livestock will not be more liberal than those utilizing a 
wilderness prior to establishment and may be more restrictive.
    (b) The Director may permit, subject to such conditions as he deems 
necessary, the maintenance, reconstruction or relocation of only those 
livestock management improvements and structures which existed within a 
wilderness unit when it was incorporated into the National Wilderness 
Preservation System.


<R05>
Sec. 35.10  Controlled burning.

    Controlled burning will be permitted on wilderness units when such 
burning will contribute to the maintenance of the wilderness resource 
and values in the unit; however, any fire in a wilderness area that 
poses a threat to resources or facilities outside the unit will be 
controlled and extinguished.

[36 FR 25426, Dec. 31, 1971, as amended at 37 FR 12067, June 17, 1972]


<R05>
Sec. 35.11  Scientific uses.

    Recognizing the scientific value of wilderness, research data 
gathering and similar scientific uses will be encouraged providing that 
wilderness values are not impaired. The person or agency involved in 
scientific investigation must be willing to accept reasonable 
limitations on activities and location and size of the area to be used 
for research purposes. A special use permit authorizing scientific uses 
shall be required.


<R05>
Sec. 35.12  Water rights.

    Nothing in the regulations in this part constitutes an expressed or 
implied claim or denial on the part of the Department of the Interior as 
to exemption from State water laws.


<R05>
Sec. 35.13  Access to State and private lands.

    Rights of States or persons and their successors in interest, whose 
land is surrounded by a wilderness unit, will be recognized to assure 
adequate access to that land. Adequate access is defined as the 
combination of modes and routes of travel which will best preserve the 
wilderness character of the landscape. Mode of travel designated shall 
be reasonable and consistent with accepted, conventional, contemporary 
modes of travel in said vicinity. Use will be consistent with reasonable 
purposes for which such land is held. The Director will issue such 
permits as are necessary for access, designating the means and route of 
travel for ingress and degress so as to preserve the wilderness 
character of the area.

[36 FR 25426, Dec. 31, 1971; 37 FR 1049, Jan. 22, 1972]


<R05>
Sec. 35.14  Special regulations.

or administrative benefits. The information requested in the application 
form is required to obtain a benefit. The public reporting burden for 
this collection of information is estimated to average 1.5 hours each 
for 150 non-competitively awarded permits and 31.66 hours each for 60 
competitively awarded permits including the time for reviewing 
instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining 
data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. 
The estimated annual number of respondents is 210, yielding a total 
annual reporting and record keeping burden of 2125 hours. Comments and 
suggestions on the burden estimate or any other aspect of the form 
should be sent directly to the Office of Information and Regulatory 
Affairs; Office of Management and Budget; Attention: Interior Desk 
Officer; Washington, DC 20503; and a copy of the comments should be sent

                       Subpart B_Subsistence Uses


<R05>
Sec. 36.11  Purpose and policy.

    (a) Consistent with the management of fish and wildlife in 
accordance with recognized scientific principles and the purposes for 
which each Alaska National Wildlife refuge was established, designated, 
or expanded by ANILCA, the purpose of this subpart is to provide the 
opportunity for local rural residents engaged in a subsistence way of 
life to do so pursuant to applicable State and Federal law.
    (b) Consistent with sound management principles and the conservation 
of healthy populations of fish and wildlife, the utilization of Alaska 
National Wildlife Refuges is to cause the least adverse impact possible 
on local rural residents who depend upon subsistence uses of the 
resources of the public lands in Alaska.
    (c) Nonwasteful subsistence uses of fish, wildlife and other 
renewable resources by local rural residents shall be the priority 
consumptive uses of such resources over any other consumptive

[[Page 453]]

uses permitted within Alaska National Wildlife Refuge areas.
    (d) The State of Alaska is authorized to regulate the taking of fish 
and wildlife for subsistence uses within Alaska National Wildlife 
Refuges to the extent such regulation is consistent with applicable 
Federal Law, including but not limited to ANILCA.
    (e) Nothing in this subpart shall be construed as permitting the 
level of subsistence uses of fish and wildlife within Alaska National 
Wildlife Refuges to be inconsistent with the conservation of healthy 
populations of fish and wildlife.


<R05>
Sec. 36.12  Use of snowmobiles, motorboats, dog teams and other means 

of surface transportation traditionally employed by local rural 
residents engaged in 
          subsistence uses.

    (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of subchapter C of title 50 
CFR the use of snowmobiles, motorboats, dog teams and other means of 
surface transportation traditionally employed by local rural residents 
engaged in subsistence uses is permitted within Alaska National Wildlife 
Refuges except at those times and in those areas restricted or closed by 
the Refuge Manager.
    (b) The Refuge Manager may restrict or close a route or area to the 
use of snowmobiles, motorboats, dog teams or other means of surface 
transportation traditionally employed by local rural residents engaged 
in subsistence uses if the Refuge Manager determines that such use is 
causing or is likely to cause an adverse impact on public health and 
safety, resource protection, protection of historic or scientific 
values, subsistence uses, conservation of endangered or threatened 
species, or other purposes and values for which the refuge was 
established.
    (c) No restrictions or closures shall be imposed without notice and 
a public hearing in the affected vicinity and other locations as 
appropriate. In the case of emergency situations, restrictions or 
closures shall not exceed sixty (60) days and shall not be extended 
unless the Refuge Manager establishes, after notice and public hearing 
in the affected vicinity and other locations as appropriate, that such 
extension is justified according to the factors set forth in paragraph 
(b) of this section. Notice of the proposed or emergency restrictions or 
closures and the reasons therefor shall be published in at least one 
newspaper of general circulation within the State and in at least one 
local newspaper if available, and information about such proposed or 
emergency actions shall also be made available for broadcast on local 
radio stations in a manner reasonably calculated to inform local rural 
residents in the affected vicinity. All restrictions and closures shall 
be designated on a map which shall be available for public inspection at 
the office of the Refuge Manager of the affected refuge and the post 
office or postal authority of every affected community within or near 
the refuge area, or by the posting of signs in the vicinity of the 
restrictions or closures, or both.
    (d) Snowmobiles, motorboats, dog teams and other means of surface 
transportation traditionally employed by local rural residents engaged 
in subsistence uses shall be operated (1) in compliance with applicable 
State and Federal law, (2) in such a manner as to prevent waste or 
damage to the refuge, and (3) in such a manner as to prevent the 
herding, harassment, hazing or driving of wildlife for hunting or other 
purposes.
    (e) At all times when not engaged in subsistence uses, local rural 
residents may use snowmobiles, motorboats, dog teams and other means of 
surface transportation in accordance with subpart C of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 36.13  Subsistence fishing.

    Fish may be taken by local rural residents for subsistence uses in 
compliance with applicable State and Federal law. To the extent 
consistent with the provisions of this part and other Federal law, 
applicable State laws and regulations governing the taking of fish which 
are now or will hereafter be in effect are hereby incorporated by 
reference as a part of these regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 36.14  Subsistence hunting and trapping.

    Local rural residents may hunt and trap wildlife for subsistence 
uses in Alaska National Wildlife Refuges in compliance with applicable

    (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the 
noncommercial cutting of live standing timber by local rural residents 
for appropriate subsistence uses, such as firewood or house logs, may be 
permitted in Alaska National Wildlife Refuges as follows:
    (1) For live standing timber greater than six inches diameter at 
breast height (4\1/2\ feet above ground level), the Refuge Manager may 
allow cutting in accordance with the specifications of a special use 
permit if such cutting is determined to be compatible with the purposes 
for which the refuge was established;
    (2) For live standing timber between three and six inches diameter 
at breast height, cutting is allowed on the Arctic National Wildlife 
Refuge south of latitude 68 degrees North and on the Innoko, Kanuti, 
Koyukuk, Nowitna, Selawik, Tetlin, and Yukon Flats National Wildlife 
Refuges unless restricted by the Refuge Manager, except that no more 
than 20 trees may be cut annually by an individual without a special use 
permit, no cutting may be done within 50 feet of a stream, lake, or 
river and no more than one tree in five (20%) may be cut in any specific 
stand; on the remainder of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and on 
all other Alaska National Wildlife Refuges, the Refuge Manager may allow 
cutting in accordance with the specifications of a special use permit if 
such cutting is determined to be compatible with the purposes for which 
the refuge was established;
    (3) For live standing timber less than three inches diameter at 
breast height, cutting is allowed unless restricted by the Refuge 
Manager.
    (b) The noncommercial gathering by local rural residents of fruits, 
berries, mushrooms, and other plant materials for subsistence uses, and 
the noncommercial gathering of dead or downed timber for firewood, shall 
be allowed without a permit.
    (c)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the Refuge 
Manager, after notice and public hearing in the affected vicinity and 
other locations as appropriate, may temporarily close all or any portion 
of an Alaska National Wildlife Refuge to subsistence uses of a 
particular plant population only if necessary for reasons of public 
safety, administration, or to assure the continued viability of such 
population. For purposes of this section, the term ``temporary'' shall 
mean only as long as reasonably necessary to achieve the purpose of the 
closure.
    (2) If the Refuge Manager determines that an emergency situation 
exists and that extraordinary measures must be taken for public safety 
or to assure the continued viability of a particular plant population, 
the Refuge Manager may immediately close all or any portion of an Alaska 
National Wildlife Refuge to the subsistence uses of such population. 
Such emergency closure shall be effective when made, shall be for a 
period not to exceed sixty (60) days, and may not subsequently be 
extended unless the Refuge Manager establishes, after notice and public 
hearing in the affected vicinity and other locations as appropriate, 
that such closure should be extended.
    (3) Notice of administrative actions taken pursuant to this section, 
and the reasons justifying such actions, shall be published in at least 
one newspaper of general circulation within the State and in at least 
one local newspaper if available, and information about such actions and 
reasons therefor also shall be made available for broadcast on local 
radio stations in a manner reasonably calculated to inform local rural 
residents in the affected vicinity. All closures shall be designated on 
a map which shall be available for public inspection at the office of 
the Refuge Manager of the affected refuge and the post office or postal 
authority of every affected community within or near the refuge, or by 
the posting of signs in the vicinity of the restrictions, or both.

and the reasons justifying such actions shall be published in at least 
one newspaper of general circulation within the State and in at least 
one local newspaper if available, and information about such actions and 
justifying reasons shall be made available for broadcast on local radio 
stations in a manner reasonably calculated to inform local rural 
residents in the affected vicinity. All closures shall be designated on 
a map which shall be available for public inspection at the office of 
the Refuge Manager of the affected refuge area and the post office or 
postal authority of every affected community within or near the refuge 
area, or by the posting of signs in the vicinity of the closures, or 
both.

<R05>
Sec. 36.31  Recreational activities.

    (a) Public recreational activities within the Alaska National 
Wildlife Refuges are authorized as long as such activities are conducted 
in a manner compatible with the purposes for which the areas were 
established. Such recreational activities include, but are not limited 
to, sightseeing, nature observation and photography, sport hunting, 
sport fishing, boating, camping, hiking, picnicking and other related 
activities. Any existing special regulations now in force and effect 
shall continue to apply to the applicable refuge lands in Alaska 
National Wildlife Refuges.
    (b) Surface collection, by hand (including handheld gold pans) and 
for personal recreational use only, of rocks and minerals is authorized: 
Provided however, That (1) collection of silver, platinum, gemstones and 
fossils is prohibited, and (2) collection methods which may result in 
disturbance of ground surface, such as the use of shovels, pickaxes, 
sluice boxes and dredges, are prohibited. The recreation activities 
specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section may be prohibited or 
otherwise restricted in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 36.42.


<R05>
Sec. 36.32  Taking of fish and wildlife.

    (a) The taking of fish and wildlife for sport hunting, trapping and 
sport fishing is authorized in accordance with applicable State and 
Federal law and such laws are hereby adopted and made a part of these 
regulations; Provided however, That the Refuge Manager, pursuant to 
Sec. 36.42, may designate areas where, and establish periods when, no 
taking of a particular population of fish or wildlife shall be 
permitted.
    (b) The exercise of valid commercial fishing rights or privileges 
obtained pursuant to existing law, including any use of refuge areas for 
campsites, cabins, motorized vehicles and aircraft landing directly 
incident to the exercise of such rights or privileges, is authorized; 
Provided, however, That the Refuge Manager may restrict or prohibit the 
exercise of these rights or privileges or uses of federally owned lands 
directly incident to such exercise if he determines, after conducting a

[[Page 456]]

public hearing in the affected locality, that they are inconsistent with 
the purposes of the refuge and that they constitute a significant 
expansion of commercial fishing activities within such refuge beyond the 
level of such activities in 1979.
    (c) The following provisions shall apply to any person while engaged 
in the taking of fish and wildlife within an Alaska National Wildlife 
Refuge:
    (1) Trapping and sport hunting. (i) Each person shall secure and 
possess all required State licenses and shall comply with the applicable 
provisions of State law unless further restricted by Federal law;
    (ii) Each person shall comply with the applicable provisions of 
Federal law;
    (iii) In addition to the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of 
this section, each person shall continue to secure a trapping permit

the flying occurred, except that a trapper may use a firearm or any 
other weapon to dispatch a legally caught wolf or wolverine in a trap or 
snare on the same day in which the flying occurred. This prohibition 
does not apply to flights on regularly scheduled commercial airlines 
between regularly maintained public airports.
    (2) Sport and commercial fishing. (i) Each person shall secure and 
possess all required State licenses and shall comply with the applicable 
provisions of State law unless further restricted by Federal law;
    (ii) Each person shall comply with the applicable provisions of 
Federal law.
    (d) Nothing in this section shall apply to the taking of fish and 
wildlife for subsistence uses.
    (e) Nothing in these rules shall be interpreted as waiving the 
requirements of other fish and wildlife conservation statutes such as 
the Airborne Hunting Act or those provisions of subchapter C of title 50 
CFR regarding the taking of depredating wildlife. Animal control 
programs shall only be conducted in accordance with a special use permit 
issued by the Refuge Manager.

<R05>
Sec. 36.33  What do I need to know about using cabins and related 

structures on Alaska National Wildlife Refuges?

    (a) Definitions. As used in this section, the term:
    Administrative cabin shall mean any cabin only used by refuge or 
other authorized personnel for the administration of the refuge.
    Cabin shall mean a small, usually single-story, three or more sided 
structure that is permanently and completely enclosed with a roof and 
walls. The roof and walls are not fabric, cannot be easily disassembled, 
and are not removed seasonally.
    Commercial cabin shall mean any cabin which is used in association 
with a commercial operation including but not limited to commercial 
fishing activities and recreational guiding services.
    Existing cabin shall mean any cabin situated on Federal lands before 
December 2, 1980. A cabin legally situated on lands that subsequently 
become refuge will also be considered an ``existing'' cabin providing 
the applicant meets the appropriate application deadlines.
    Family shall include the spouse (including what is known as a 
common-law relationship), children by birth or adoption, and other blood 
relatives within the second degree of kindred.
    Guest shall mean a person who occasionally visits the permittee in 
the cabin. This term does not include clients using commercial cabins.
    Immediate family shall include the spouse and children, either by 
birth or adoption, of the claimant residing in the cabin or structure.
    New cabin shall mean any permitted cabin constructed on refuge lands 
after December 2, 1980. This may also include a cabin whose claimant 
failed to meet the application deadline for existing cabins but is 
otherwise a permitted cabin.

[[Page 457]]

    Other related structures shall mean those structures or devices 
essential to the activities for which the cabin special use permit is 
issued. This includes but is not limited to outdoor toilets, food 
caches, storage sheds, and fish drying racks.
    Private recreational use shall mean a use associated with leisure 
activities, not including bona fide subsistence uses or authorized 
commercial uses.
    Public use cabin shall mean a cabin owned and administered by the 
Fish and Wildlife Service and available for use by the public.
    (b) All cabins. The regulations in this paragraph (b) shall apply to 
all cabins, claimants, occupants, and guests. The regulations in this 
paragraph (b) do not apply to temporary facilities: any structure or 
man-made improvement which can readily be completely dismantled and 
removed from the site when the period of authorized use is terminated.
    (1) A special use permit is required to construct, use and/or occupy 
a cabin on Fish and Wildlife Service lands within the refuge. The permit 
may also authorize the use of related structures and other necessary 
appurtenances.
    (2) After adequate public notice has been given, unclaimed cabins 
become the property of the Federal Government. Adequate public notice 
shall include: Posting notices of trespass on unclaimed cabins; 
publication of notices of trespass in Anchorage and Fairbanks newspapers 
and in at least one local newspaper if available; and posting notices of 
trespass at appropriate community post offices. A Government-owned cabin 
may be used for refuge administration, used for emergency purposes by 
the public, permitted to another applicant, designated a public use 
cabin, or destroyed. Disposal of excess cabins and structures will be 
according to regulations pursuant to title 41, chapter 114 of the Code 
of Federal Regulations.
    (3) Willful noncompliance with the conditions and stipulations of a 
special use permit shall be considered grounds to invoke the 
administrative process leading to notice and hearing, and possible 
revocation of the permit. The refuge manager will attempt to resolve 
problems of noncompliance with the permittee as soon as possible after 
the situation becomes known. If this effort fails, the refuge manager 
shall provide written notice to the permittee within 30 days of that 
date, informing the permittee of noncompliance, giving specific 
instructions for compliance and providing appropriate time for the 
permittee to comply.
    (4) No special use permit will be issued for the construction of a 
cabin for private recreational use or for the private recreational use 
of an existing cabin.
    (5) Guests are allowed to occupy a cabin only during the activity 
period identified on the special use permit. Guests occupying a cabin 
during the absence of the permittee shall obtain a letter of 
authorization from the permittee. The guest must have a copy of the 
letter in his/her possession. In commercial cabins, the permittee or 
another person listed on the permit must be present when the cabin is 
occupied by guests or clients.
    (6) A person whose permit application (new or renewal) for a cabin 
has been denied or whose cabin permit has been revoked by the refuge 
manager may appeal to the Regional Director as described in Sec. 
36.41(b).
    (c) Existing cabins. In addition to paragraph (b) of this section, 
the regulations in this paragraph (c) shall apply to all existing 
cabins, claimants, occupants, and guests.
    (1) Where a valid cabin permit or lease was in effect on December 2, 
1980, or at the time the land was subsequently added to the refuge, the 
refuge manager shall provide for the continuation of the permit or lease 
under the same conditions. The new permit shall be nontransferable and 
renewable every five years unless the continuation would directly 
threaten or significantly impair the purposes for which the refuge was 
established. The cabin and related structures are the personal property 
of the claimant and can be removed by him/her upon non-renewal or 
revocation. The owner of a cabin may sell his/her interest in the cabin 
to another person; however, the new owner does not automatically qualify 
for a permit and must apply for a new one.
    (2) To obtain a special use permit for a cabin that was not under 
permit or

[[Page 458]]

lease before December 2, 1980, or at the time the land was subsequently 
added to the refuge, a claimant should submit to the refuge manager an 
application that includes the following:
    (i) Reasonable proof of possessory interest or right to occupy the 
cabin as shown by affidavit, bill of sale, or other document.
    (ii) Date of construction or acquisition.
    (iii) A sketch or photograph that accurately depicts the cabin and 
related structures.
    (iv) The dimensions of the cabin and related structures.
    (v) A U.S. Geological Survey topographic map that shows the 
geographic location of the cabin and related structures.
    (vi) The claimant's agreement to vacate and remove all personal 
property from the cabin and related structures within one year from 
receipt of a non-renewal or revocation notice.
    (vii) The claimant's acknowledgment that he/she has no legal 
interest in the real property on which the cabin and related structures 
are located.
    (viii) A list of family members residing with the claimant in the 
cabin being applied for. It need only include those immediate family 
members who may be eligible to renew a permit for continued use and 
occupancy upon the original claimant's death (this is not applicable to 
cabins used for commercial purposes).
    (3) Applications for permits for existing cabins, which are not 
currently under valid permits, will only be accepted for a period of one 
year following the effective date of these regulations. However, cabins 
that were legally located on lands that subsequently become refuge will 
also be considered ``existing'' cabins. The owners will have two years 
following the date the lands become refuge to apply for a permit. 
Following those dates, all applications for cabins will be for ``new'' 
cabins only, no matter when the cabin was built or first used. If 
ownership is not established within three years after the land becomes 
refuge, the cabin may be considered abandoned, and it will become 
Federal property in accordance with Federal regulations.
    (4) The occupancy of a noncommercial cabin is limited to the 
permittee and his/her family, bona fide partners, and guests.
    (5) Major modification or rehabilitation of an existing cabin must 
be approved by the refuge manager before construction begins. The 
modifications will be done by the permittee or designated agent and will 
remain the property of the permittee. Major additions (e.g., larger than 
the original cabin) may fall under the ownership provisions for new 
cabins. Although cabins destroyed by accidents, vandalism or natural 
causes may be reconstructed, they must be approved by the refuge manager 
before construction and must meet the construction guidelines for new 
cabins, even though remaining the property of the claimant.
    (d) New cabins. In addition to paragraph (b) of this section, the 
regulations in this paragraph (d) shall apply to all new cabins, 
claimants, occupants, and guests.
    (1) A nontransferable, five year special use permit shall only be 
issued upon a determination that the proposed construction, use and 
maintenance of the cabin is compatible with refuge purposes and that the 
cabin use is either directly related to refuge administration or is 
needed for continuation of an ongoing activity or use otherwise allowed 
within the refuge where the applicant lacks a reasonable off-refuge 
site. In addition, these activities must have historically been 
supported by the construction and use of cabins in the geographic area. 
In general, new cabin permits will be given only to local residents to 
pursue a legitimate subsistence activity. In determining whether to 
permit the construction, use, and occupancy of cabins or other 
structures, the refuge manager shall be guided by factors such as other 
public uses, public health and safety, environmental and resource 
protection, research activities, protection of historic or scientific 
values, subsistence uses, endangered or threatened species conservation 
and other management considerations necessary to ensure that the 
activities authorized pursuant to a permit are compatible with the 
purposes for which the refuge was established.

[[Page 459]]

    (2) To obtain a special use permit for a new cabin, an applicant 
should submit to the refuge manager an application that includes the 
following:
    (i) A sketch that accurately depicts the proposed cabin and related 
structures.
    (ii) The dimensions of the proposed cabin and related structures.
    (iii) A U.S. Geological Survey topographic map that shows the 
geographic location of the proposed cabin and related structures.
    (iv) The applicant's agreement to vacate and remove all personal 
property from the cabin and related structures within one year from 
receipt of a non-renewal or revocation notice.
    (v) The applicant's acknowledgment that he/she has no legal interest 
in the cabin and related structures or in the real property on which the 
cabin and related structures are located.
    (vi) A list of family members residing with the applicant in the 
cabin being applied for. It need only include those immediate family 
members who may be eligible to renew a permit for continued use and 
occupancy upon the original claimant's death.
    (3) The permitting instrument shall be a nontransferable renewable 
five year special use permit. It shall be renewed every five years (upon 
request) until the death of the original claimant's last immediate 
family member unless the special use permit has been revoked or the 
cabin has been abandoned.
    (4) No new cabins will be constructed in designated wilderness areas 
unless they are built specifically for the administration of the area, 
for public safety, or for trapping where trapping has been a traditional 
and customary use.
    (5) New trapping cabins in wilderness will be available for public 
use to ensure public health and safety.
    (6) The occupancy of a noncommercial cabin is limited to the 
permittee, and his/her family, bona fide partners, and guests.
    (e) Commercial cabins. In addition to paragraph (b) of this section, 
the regulations in this paragraph (e) shall apply to all commercial 
cabins, permittees, clients, guests, and occupants.
    (1) A special use permit is required for all cabins used for 
commercial purposes. Refuge managers may also issue special use permits 
that authorize additional commercial use of an existing cabin used for 
guiding, etc. The use of a new cabin shall be limited to the type of use 
specified in the original permit. The refuge manager may permit the use 
of an existing cabin on non-wilderness refuge lands for the exercise of 
valid commercial fishing rights. Such a permit may be denied if, after 
conducting a public hearing in the affected locality, it is found that 
the use is inconsistent with refuge purposes and is a significant 
expansion of commercial fishing activities within the unit beyond 1979 
levels.
    (2) When the commercial fishing or guiding rights associated with a 
permittee's existing cabin are acquired by a new party, the privilege of 
using the cabin cannot be sold and the new party does not necessarily 
qualify for a cabin permit. He/she must apply for a permit and meet the 
criteria described in this paragraph (e) before issuance of a special 
use permit by the refuge manager. He/she may not occupy the cabin before 
issuance of a permit.
    (3) No new commercial cabins will be permitted in wilderness areas.
    (4) Commercial cabins may be occupied only by persons legitimately 
involved in the commercial enterprise, assistants, employees, their 
families, guests and clients and only during the time that the 
authorized activity is occurring. The names of those individuals, 
excluding guests and clients, will be listed on the permit. The 
permittee or another individual listed on the permit must be present 
when the cabin is occupied.
    (5) Special use permits for commercial cabins may be renewed 
annually in conjunction with the special use permit renewal for the 
commercial activity itself. The cabin permit may be issued for periods 
of up to five years and is a separate permit from one issued for the 
commercial activity.
    (f) Administrative and government-owned public use cabins. In 
addition to paragraph (a) of this section, the regulations in this 
paragraph (f) apply to all administrative and government-owned cabins.

[[Page 460]]

    (1) The refuge manager can designate those cabins not under permit 
as administrative cabins to be used for official government business. 
Administrative cabins may be used by the public during life-threatening 
emergencies. On a case-by-case basis, they may also be designated as 
public use cabins when not needed for government purposes. In such 
cases, the refuge manager must inform the public and post dates or 
seasons when the cabins are available.
    (2) The refuge manager may designate government-owned cabins as 
public use cabins. They are only intended for short-term public 
recreational use and occupancy. The refuge manager may develop an 
allocation system for managing public use cabins for short-term 
recreational use. No existing public use cabins shall be removed or new 
public use cabins constructed within wilderness areas designated by the 
Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 or subsequently 
designated wilderness areas until the Secretary of the Interior notifies 
the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs and the Senate 
Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.

Sec. 36.37  Revenue producing visitor services.

    (a) Applicability. (1) Except as otherwise provided for in this 
paragraph, the regulations contained in this section apply to new 
visitor services provided within all National Wildlife Refuge areas in 
Alaska.
    (2) The rights granted by this section to historical operators, 
preferred operators, and Cook Inlet Region, Incorporated, are not 
exclusive. The Refuge Manager may authorize other persons to provide 
visitor services on refuge lands. Nothing in this section shall require 
the Refuge Manager to issue a visitor services permit if not otherwise 
mandated by statute to do so. Nothing in this section shall authorize 
the Refuge Manager to issue a visitor services permit to a person who is 
not capable of carrying out its terms and conditions in a satisfactory 
manner.

[[Page 461]]

    (3) This section does not apply to the guiding of sport hunting or 
sport fishing.
    (b) Definitions. The following definitions shall apply to this 
section:
    (1) Best offer means a responsive offer that best meets, as 
determined by the Refuge Manager, the selection criteria contained in a 
competitive solicitation for a visitor services permit.
    (2) Controlling interest, in the case of a corporation means an 
interest, beneficial or otherwise, of sufficient outstanding voting 
securities or capital of the business, so as to permit exercise of final 
managerial authority over the actions and operations of the corporation, 
or election of a majority of the Board of Directors of the corporation.
    (3) Controlling interest in the case of a partnership, limited 
partnership, joint venture or individual entrepreneurship means a 
beneficial ownership of or interest in the entity so as to permit the 
exercise of final managerial authority over the actions and operations 
of the entity.
    (4) Controlling interest in other circumstances means any 
arrangement under which a third party has the ability to exercise 
general management authority over the actions or operations of the 
business.
    (5) Historical operator means any person who:
    (i) On or before January 1, 1979, was lawfully engaged in adequately 
providing any type of visitor service in a refuge within the scope of 
paragraph (c) of this section;
    (ii) Has continued to lawfully provide that visitor service; and
    (iii) Is otherwise determined by the Refuge Manager to have a right 
to continue to provide such services or similar services pursuant to 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (6) Local area means that area in Alaska within 100 miles of the 
location within a refuge where any of the visitor service is authorized.
    (7) Local resident means:
    (i) For individuals. Those individuals that have maintained their 
primary, permanent residence and business within the local area for the 
past twelve (12) consecutive months and whenever absent from this 
primary, permanent residence, have the intention of returning to it. 
Factors demonstrating the location of an individual's primary, permanent 
residence and business may include, but are not limited to, the 
permanent address indicated on licenses issued by the State of Alaska, 
tax returns, and voter registrations.
    (ii) For corporations. A corporation in which the controlling 
interest is held by an individual or individuals who qualify as ``local 
resident(s)'' within the meaning of this section. For non-profit 
corporations a majority of the board members and a majority of the 
officers must qualify as ``local residents.''
    (8) Native Corporation means the same as defined in section 102(6) 
of ANILCA.
    (9) Preferred operator means a local resident or Native Corporation 
which is entitled to a preference under this section in the award of a 
permit, and as otherwise provided under section 1307(b) of ANILCA.
    (10) A responsive offer means one which is timely made and meets the 
terms and conditions of the solicitation document.
    (11) Similar visitor service means that visitor service authorized 
by the Refuge Manager to be provided on a refuge and determined by the 
Refuge Manager, on a case by case basis, to be similar to an established 
service being provided by a historical operator.
    (12) Visitor service means any service or activity made available 
for a fee, commission, brokerage, or other compensation to persons who 
visit a refuge, including such services as providing food, 
accommodations, transportation, tours, and guides excepting the guiding 
of sport hunting and fishing. This also includes any activity where one 
participant/member or group of participants pays more in fees than the 
other participants (non-member fees, etc.), or fees are paid to the 
organization which are in excess of the bona fide expenses of the trip.
    (13) Right of first refusal means, as it relates to section 1307(a) 
of ANILCA, a reasonable opportunity for a historical operator to review 
a description of the new similar service and the terms and conditions 
upon which it is to be provided to determine if the historical visitor 
service operator wishes to provide

[[Page 462]]

the service. As it relates to section 1307(c) of ANILCA, it refers to 
the opportunity for Cook Inlet Region, Incorporated to have the first 
opportunity to provide new visitor services on the Kenai National 
Wildlife Refuge in the Cook Inlet Region.
    (c) Visitor services existing on or before January 1, 1979, 
``historical operators''. (1) A historical operator shall have a right 
to continue to provide visitor services or similar services within such 
area, under appropriate terms and conditions, so long as such services 
are determined by the Refuge Manager to be consistent with the purposes 
for which the refuge was established. A historical operator must obtain 
a permit from the refuge manager to conduct the visitor services. The 
permit shall be for a fixed term and specified area, and shall contain 
such terms and conditions as are in the public interest. Failure to 
comply with the terms and conditions of the permit may result in 
cancellation of the authorization and consequent loss of historical 
operator rights under this section. Nothing in this section shall 
prohibit the Refuge Manager from permitting persons, in addition to 
historical operators, to provide visitor services in the refuge at the 
Refuge Manager's discretion so long as historical operators are 
permitted to conduct a scope or level of visitor services equal to or 
greater than those provided prior to January 1, 1979, under terms and 
conditions consistent with this section. A historical operator may be 
permitted by the Refuge Manager, under separate authority, to increase 
the scope or level of visitor services provided prior to January 1, 
1979, but no historical operating rights shall be obtained in such 
increase.
    (2) A historical operator may also apply to the Refuge Manager for a 
permit or amended permit to provide similar types of visitor services. 
Granting the request will not result in an increase in the scope or 
level of service in excess of those provided as of January 1, 1979, by 
the requesting historical operator. The Refuge Manager shall grant the 
request if such visitor services are determined by the Refuge Manager to 
be:
    (i) Consistent with the management of refuge resources and the 
purposes for which the refuge area was established;
    (ii) Similar to the visitor services provided by the historical 
operator prior to January 1, 1979; and
    (iii) Consistent with the legal rights of any other person.
    (3) When a historical operator permit has expired, and if the 
visitor services permitted by it were adequately provided and consistent 
with the purposes of the refuge as determined by the Refuge Manager, the 
Refuge Manager shall renew the permit for a fixed term consistent with 
such new terms and conditions as are in the public interest. Should a 
historical operator decline to accept an offer of renewal, its rights as 
a historical operator shall be considered as terminated.
    (4) If the Refuge Manager determines that permitted visitor services 
must be curtailed or reduced in scope or season to protect refuge 
resources, or for other purposes, the Refuge Manager shall require the 
historical operator to make such changes in visitor services. If more 
than one historical operator providing the same type of visitor services 
is required to have those services curtailed, the Refuge Manager shall 
establish a proportionate reduction of visitor services among all such 
historical operators, taking into account historical operating levels 
and other appropriate factors, so as to achieve a fair curtailment of 
visitor services among the historical operators. If the level of visitor 
services must be so curtailed that only one historical operator feasibly 
may continue to provide the visitor services, the Refuge Manager shall 
select one historical operator to continue to provide the curtailed 
visitor services through a competitive selection process.
    (5) The rights of a historical operator shall terminate if the 
historical operator fails to provide the visitor services under the 
terms and conditions of a permit issued by the Refuge Manager or fails 
to provide the visitor services for a period of more than twenty four 
(24) consecutive months.
    (6) The rights of a historical operator under this section shall 
terminate upon a change, after January 1, 1979, in the controlling 
interest of the historical

[[Page 463]]

operator through sale, assignment, devise, transfer or otherwise.
    (7) The Refuge Manager may authorize other persons to provide 
visitor services in a refuge in addition to historical operators, as 
long as such other persons conduct the services in a manner compatible 
with the purposes of the refuge.
    (d) Visitor services initially authorized after January 1, 1979, 
``preferred operators''. (1) In selecting persons to provide, and in 
permitting any type of visitor service, excepting guided hunting or 
fishing, the Refuge Manager will give a preference to preferred 
operators determined qualified to provide such visitor services. 
Preferences for most directly affected Native Corporation(s) and local 
residents are equal and are not additive.
    (2) In selecting persons to provide any type of visitor service for 
refuges subject to a preferred operator preference under this section, 
the Refuge Manager will publicly solicit competitive offers for persons 
to apply for a permit, or the renewal of a permit, to provide such 
visitor service pursuant to Service procedures. Preferred operators must 
submit a responsive offer to such solicitation in order to effect their 
preference. If, as a result of the solicitation, an offer from a person 
other than a preferred operator is determined to be the best offer and 
that offeror is determined to be capable of carrying out the terms of 
the permit, the preferred operator which submitted the most responsive 
offer shall be given an opportunity to substantially equal the best 
offer received by amending its offer. If the amended offer of the 
preferred operator is considered by the Refuge Manager as being 
substantially equal to the terms of the best offer, the preferred 
operator, if determined to be capable of carrying out the terms of the 
permit, shall be awarded the visitor service permit. If the preferred 
operator fails to meet these requirements, the Refuge Manager shall 
award the permit to the person who submitted the best offer in response 
to the solicitation. The Native Corporation(s) determined to be ``most 
directly affected'' under this section and local residents have equal 
preference.
    (3) Nothing in this section shall prohibit the Refuge Manager from 
authorizing persons other than preferred operators to provide visitor 
services in refuge areas so long as the procedures described in this 
section have been followed with respect to preferred operators. 
Preferred operators are not entitled by this section to provide all 
visitor services in a qualified refuge.
    (4) An offer from a Native Corporation or a local corporation under 
this section must document its controlling interest in the entity or in 
the case of a joint venture, all partners, making the offer.
    (5) The preferences described in this section may not be sold, 
assigned, transferred, or devised, directly or indirectly.
    (e) Preference to Cook Inlet Region, Incorporated (CIRI). (1) Cook 
Inlet Region, Incorporated, in cooperation with village corporations 
within Cook Inlet Region when appropriate, shall have a right of first 
refusal to provide new visitor services within that portion of the Kenai 
National Moose Range (Kenai National Wildlife Refuge) within the 
boundaries of Cook Inlet Region. The CIRI shall have ninety (90) days 
from receipt of a prospectus in which to exercise its right.
    (2) In order to exercise this right of first refusal, CIRI must 
submit an offer responsive to the terms of a visitor services 
solicitation. If CIRI makes such an offer and is determined by the 
Refuge Manager to be capable of carrying out the terms of the special 
use permit, it shall be awarded the permit. If it does not, the permit 
may be awarded to another person pursuant to a showing that such other 
person can carry out the conditions of the special use permit in a 
manner compatible with the purposes of the refuge. An offer being made 
by CIRI under this section must document controlling interest by CIRI 
when made in cooperation with village corporations within the Cook Inlet 
Region. The CIRI right of first refusal shall have precedence over the 
rights of preferred operators.
    (3) The right of first refusal described in this section may not be 
sold, transferred, devised, or assigned, directly or indirectly.

[[Page 464]]

    (f) Most directly affected Native Corporation determination. (1) 
Prior to the issuance of a solicitation document for any new visitor 
service in a refuge, the Refuge Manager shall provide an opportunity for 
any Native Corporation interested in providing visitor services within 
that refuge to submit an application to the Refuge Manager to be 
determined ``most directly affected'' Native Corporation. The 
application shall include but not be limited to, the following 
information:
    (i) The name, address, and telephone number of the Native 
Corporation, the date of incorporation, its articles of incorporation 
and structure, and the name of the applicable refuge area;
    (ii) The location of the corporation's population center or centers;
    (iii) An assessment of the socioeconomic impacts, including 
historical and traditional use, and their effects on the Native 
Corporation as a result of the expansion or establishment of the refuge; 
and
    (iv) Any other information the Native Corporation believes is 
relevant.
    (2) Upon receipt of all applications from interested Native 
Corporations, the Refuge Manager will determine the ``most directly 
affected'' Native Corporation based on, but not limited to, the 
following criteria:
    (i) The number of acres of surface land within and adjoining the 
refuge that the Native Corporation owns, or which has been selected 
under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, unless such selection is 
determined to be invalid or is relinquished;
    (ii) The distance and accessibility from the Native Corporation's 
population center and/or business address to the applicable refuge; and
    (iii) The socio-economic impacts, including historic and traditional 
use, and their effects as a result of the expansion or establishment of 
the refuge.
    (3) In the event that more than one Native Corporation is determined 
to be equally affected, each such Native Corporation shall be considered 
as a preferred operator under this section.
    (4) The Refuge Manager's ``most directly affected'' Native 
Corporation determination or when requested, the Regional Director's 
appeal decision for a refuge is applicable for all new visitor services 
in that refuge.
    (5) Any Native Corporation that has not applied for a most directly 
affected Native Corporation determination may apply for a determination 
upon issuance of a future solicitation for a new visitor service. A 
corporation determined to be most directly affected for a refuge will 
maintain that status for all future visitor service solicitations.
    (g) Appeal procedures. Any person(s) who believe that they have been 
improperly denied rights with respect to providing visitor services 
under this section may appeal the denial to the Regional Director. Such 
an appeal must be submitted in writing within forty-five (45) days of 
receipt of the denial from which an appeal is sought. The appeals 
process as defined in 50 CFR subpart F, 36.41(b) will apply with 
exception of the period of time allowed to file an appeal.

    Subpart F_Permits and Public Participation and Closure Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 36.41  Permits.

    (a) Applicability. The regulations contained in this section apply 
to the issuance and administration of competitively and noncompetitively 
issued permits for economic and/or other privileged uses on all national 
wildlife refuges in Alaska. Nothing in this section requires the refuge 
manager to issue a special use permit if not otherwise mandated by 
statute to do so. Supplemental procedures for granting historical use, 
Native Corporation, and local preferences in the selection of commercial 
operators to hold permits to provide visitor services, other than 
hunting and fishing guiding on refuges in Alaska, are addressed in Sec. 
36.37, Revenue producing visitor services.
    (b) Definitions. As used in this section, the term or terms:
    Commercial visitor service means any service or activity made 
available for a fee, commission, brokerage or other compensation to 
persons who visit a refuge, including such services as providing food, 
accommodations, transportation, tours, and guides. Included is any 
activity where one participant/member or group of participants pays more 
in fees than the other participants (non-member fees, etc.), or fees are 
paid to the organization which are in excess of the bona fide expenses 
of the trip;
    Entire business means all assets including, but not limited to, 
equipment, facilities, and other holdings directly associated with the 
permittee's type of commercial visitor service authorized by permit. 
This term also includes assets held under the name of separate business 
entities, which provide the same specific type of commercial visitor 
services authorized by permit, that the permittee has a financial 
interest in. The term does not include related enterprises owned by the 
permittee such as taxidermy and travel services;
    Immediate family means the spouse and children, either by birth or 
adoption, of the permittee.
    Operations plan means a narrative description of the commercial 
operations

[[Page 470]]

which contains all required information identified in the prospectus;
    Permit means a special use permit issued by the refuge manager which 
authorizes a commercial visitor service or other activity restricted by 
law or regulation on a national wildlife refuge;
    Prospectus means the document that the Service uses in soliciting 
competition to award commercial visitor services on a refuge;
    Subcontracting means any activity in which the permittee provides 
financial or other remuneration to anyone other than employees to 
conduct the specific commercial services authorized by the Service. The 
permittee's primary authorized activities must be conducted in a genuine 
employer/employee relationship where the source of all remuneration for 
services provided to clients is from the permittee. Subcontracting does 
not apply to booking services or authorized secondary services provided 
to clients in support of the permittee's primary authorized activities 
(e.g., a guide paying a marine or air taxi operator to transport 
clients);
    Subletting means any activity in which the permittee receives 
financial or other remuneration in return for allowing another 
commercial operator to conduct any of the permittee's authorized 
activities in the permittee's use area; and
    Use area means the designated area where commercial services may be 
conducted by the permittee.
    (c) General provisions. In all cases where a permit is required, the 
permittee must abide by the conditions under which the permit was 
issued. Refuge managers will provide written notice to the permittee in 
all cases where documentation of noncompliance is prepared for use in 
any administrative proceeding involving the permittee.
    (d) Application. (1) This section and other regulations in this part 
36, generally applicable to the National Wildlife Refuge System, require 
that permits be obtained from the refuge manager. For activities on the 
following refuges, request permits from the respective refuge manager in 
the following locations:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                 Refuge                           Office location
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alaska Peninsula National Wildlife        King Salmon.

Tetlin National Wildlife Refuge.........  Tok.
Togiak National Wildlife Refuge.........  Dillingham.
Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge....  Bethel.
Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge....  Fairbanks.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) For noncompetitively issued permits, the applicant may present 
the application verbally if he/she is unable to prepare a written 
application. The refuge manager will keep a written record of such 
verbal application. For competitively issued permits, the applicant must 
submit a written application in the format delineated in the prospectus 
or other designated format of the Service.
    (3) The refuge manager will grant or deny applications for 
noncompetitively issued permits in writing within 45 days, except for 
good cause. For competitively issued permits, the refuge manager will 
grant or deny applications in accordance with the time frame established 
in the prospectus, except for good cause.
    (4) Refuge managers may establish application period deadlines for 
individual refuges for both competitively and noncompetitively issued 
permits. The refuge manager will send notification of availability for 
commercial opportunities and application deadlines to existing and/or 
the previous year's permittees. He/she will publish the notice in at 
least one newspaper of general circulation in the State and in at least 
one local newspaper if available, and will make available for broadcast 
on local radio stations in a manner reasonably calculated to inform 
local prospective applicants.
    (5) The Service may limit the number of applications that an 
individual may submit for competitively awarded offerings.

[[Page 471]]

    (e) Competitively awarded permits. (1) Where the number of available 
permits is limited, refuge managers will award permits competitively. A 
prospectus with invitation to bid system will be the primary competitive 
method used for selecting commercial visitor services. Where justified, 
other selection methods, including but not limited to lotteries, may be 
used. Such circumstances may include, but not be limited to, the timely 
refilling of use areas that have become vacant during regularly 
scheduled terms to prevent commercial visitor service opportunities from 
going unused, and initiating trial programs on individual refuges. The 
refuge manager has discretionary authority to issue noncompetitive 
permits on a one-time, short-term basis to accredited educational 
institutions and other nonprofit organizations to conduct primarily 
environmental education-related activities that also may be recreational 
in nature in use areas where permits for that type of guided 
recreational activity are otherwise limited to competitive award.
    (2) Where numbers of permits have been limited for an activity prior 
to the promulgation of these regulations and a prospectus with 
invitation to bid system has not yet been developed, refuge managers may 
issue noncompetitive five-year permits consistent with the terms set 
forth in paragraph (e)(16) of this section on a one-time basis to 
existing permittees.
    (3) The Service will publish notice of all solicitations for 
competition in accordance with paragraph (d)(4) of this section and 
include reasonable application periods of not less than 60 days. When 
competitively selecting permittees for an activity in a use area where 
permits for that activity were not previously competitively awarded, the 
Service will publish notice of the upcoming opportunity a minimum of 18 
months prior to the effective date of the permit term.
    (4) All prospectuses will identify the selection criteria that the 
Service will use to evaluate the proposals. All prospectuses involving 
commercial visitor services must include experience and performance in 
providing the same or similar services as a criterion. In evaluating the 
experience of an applicant, the Service will specifically consider 
knowledge of the specific area covered by the prospectus and the nature 
of the technical skills required to provide quality service to the 
public.
    (5) A panel of Service employees who use a scoring process based on 
the selection criteria will evaluate and rank applications received in 
response to a prospectus.
    (6) The Service has discretionary authority to not evaluate or 
consider proposals that are incomplete or improperly submitted.
    (7) The Service may establish minimum scores to qualify for the 
award of permits. If established, these minimum scores will be 
identified in the prospectus.
    (8) The Service may establish limits on the number of use areas 
within an individual refuge, or on refuges statewide, in which a 
permittee is authorized to operate. This limit applies to different 
corporations in which the same individual has any ownership interests.
    (9) When vacancies occur in competitively filled use areas, the 
procedure for reissuing the permits will depend on how long it has been 
since the permit originally was issued. The Service will award the 
permit to the next highest ranking interested applicant in the original 
solicitation, if a vacancy occurs within the first 12 months of the 
permit's effective date. Resolicited competition for the area will occur 
as soon as practicable if:
    (i) A vacancy occurs after 12 months of the permit's effective date; 
and
    (ii) At least 24 months of the original permit term is available for 
a new permittee after completion of the solicitation, application, 
evaluation and awards period. If less than 24 months of the term of the 
permit is available, the Service has the discretion to solicit 
competition during the regularly scheduled solicitation period. The 
Service may annually issue noncompetitive permits for vacant areas, 
where there has not been significant permittee interest, until 
competition can be solicited in conjunction with other solicitations for 
vacant areas.
    (10) Terms of permits awarded under the prospectus with invitation 
method

[[Page 472]]

are valid for 5 years except in those instances where the Service issues 
permits to fill vacancies occurring during a scheduled award cycle. In 
these instances, the permit duration is limited to the expiration date 
of the original award period. Permits awarded under the prospectus by 
invitation method must be renewed noncompetitively by the refuge manager 
for a period of 5 additional years upon application and a showing of 
permittee compliance with all applicable permit terms and conditions and 
a satisfactory record of performance. After one renewal, the Service 
shall not extend or noncompetitively renew another permit.
    (11) Permit privileges may be transferred to other qualified 
entities that demonstrate the ability to meet Service standards, as 
outlined in the prospectus upon which the existing permit was based, 
subject to approval by the refuge manager. Requests for transfers must 
be made in writing to the refuge manager. A permittee who transfers his/
her privileges will not be eligible to be considered for competitively 
awarded permits for the same type of activity on the same national 
wildlife refuge for a period of three years following the authorized 
transfer. The Service retains complete discretion in allowing transfers. 
In general, the Service approves transfers only upon demonstrating that 
it is to the government's benefit and if all the following criteria are 
satisfied:
    (i) The transfer is part of the sale or disposition of the current 
permittee's entire business as earlier defined;
    (ii) The current permittee was either conducting the commercial 
operation in the refuge under authorization of a permit for a minimum of 
12 years or owns significant real property in the area, the value of 
which is dependent on holding a refuge permit. Consideration of the last 
element will include, but is not limited to:
    (A) The relationship of the real property to permitted refuge 
activities as documented in the operations plan;
    (B) The percentage that the authorized refuge activities comprise of 
the total commercial use associated with the real property; and
    (C) The appraised value of the real property.
    (iii) The transferee must be independently qualified to hold the 
permit under the standards of the prospectus of the original existing 
permit.
    (iv) The transferee has an acceptable history of compliance with 
State and Federal fish and wildlife and related permit regulations 
during the past 5 years. An individual with any felony conviction is an 
ineligible transferee. Transfer approval to an individual having any 
violations, convictions, or pleas of nolo contendere for fish and 
wildlife related federal misdemeanors or State violations will be 
discretionary. Denial is based on, but not limited to, whether the 
individual committed any violation in which the case disposition 
resulted in any of the following:
    (A) Any jail time served or probation;
    (B) Any criminal fine of $250 or greater;
    (C) Forfeiture of equipment or harvested animal (or parts thereof) 
valued at $250 or greater;
    (D) Suspension of privileges or revocation of any fish and wildlife 
related license/permits;
    (E) Other alternative sentencing that indicates the penalty is of 
equal severity to the foregoing elements; or
    (F) Any multiple convictions or pleas of nolo contendere for fish 
and wildlife-related Federal misdemeanors or State fish and wildlife-
related violations or misdemeanors irrespective of the amount of the 
fine.
    (12) The transferee must follow the operations plan of the original 
permittee. The transferee may modify the operations plan with the 
written consent of the refuge manager as long as the change does not 
result in increased adverse impacts to refuge resources or other refuge 
users.
    (13) Upon timely approval of the transfer, the Service will issue 
the new permittee a permit for the remaining portion of the original 
permit term. The refuge manager retains the right to restrict, suspend, 
revoke, or not renew the permit for failure to comply with its terms and 
conditions.
    (14) Permit privileges issued under this paragraph (e) may be 
transferred, subject to refuge manager approval, to a former spouse when 
a court awards permit-associated business assets in a

[[Page 473]]

divorce settlement agreement to that person. The recipient must 
independently qualify to hold the originally issued permit under the 
minimum standards identified by the Service, and the permittee must have 
an acceptable history of compliance as set forth in paragraph 
(e)(11)(iv) of this section.
    (15) Permit privileges issued under this paragraph (e) may be 
transferred in the case of death or disability of the permittee, subject 
to refuge manager approval, as provided in this paragraph (e). In these 
cases, the permit privileges may pass to a spouse who can demonstrate 
he/she is capable of providing the authorized services and who has an 
acceptable history of compliance as set forth in paragraph (e)(11)(iv) 
of this section. A spouse who lacks any required license(s) but 
otherwise qualifies may hire an employee, who holds the required 
license(s) and who has an acceptable history of compliance as set forth 
in paragraph (e)(11)(iv) of this section, to assist in the operation. 
Permit privileges may also pass to another member of the immediate 
family or a person who was a business partner at the time of original 
permit issuance. This person must be independently qualified under the 
minimum standards identified by the Service at the time of original 
permit issuance and have an acceptable history of compliance as set 
forth in paragraph (e)(11)(iv) of this section.
    (16) Upon September 26, 1997, refuge managers will amend existing 
competitively-awarded permits through the prospectus method to make the 
terms fully consistent with this section, including eligibility for a 5-
year non-competitive renewal.
    (f) Fees. Permittees must pay fees formally established by regional 
and/or nation-wide Service policy. The refuge manager must document any 
fee exemption.
    (g) Subletting and subcontracting. A permittee may not sublet any 
part of an authorized use area. Subcontracting any service authorized by 
the permit requires written approval from the refuge manager unless the 
subcontracted service is specifically identified in the permittee's 
approved perations plan.
    (h) Restriction, suspension and revocation of permits. The refuge 
manager may suspend, revoke, or reasonably restrict the terms of a 
permit for noncompliance with the terms and conditions of the 
regulations in this subchapter C; for nonuse of the permit; for 
violations/convictions (including pleas of nolo contendere) of any law 
or regulation pertaining to the same type of activity authorized by the 
permit, whether or not the activity occurred on or off the refuge; to 
protect public health or safety; or if the refuge manager determines the 
use to be incompatible with refuge purposes or is inconsistent with the 
Service's obligations under Title VIII of the Alaska National Interest 
Lands Conservation Act. All actions pertaining to this paragraph are 
subject to the appeal process as set forth in paragraph (i) of this 
section.
    (i) Appeals. (1) Any person adversely affected by a refuge manager's 
decision or order relating to the person's permit, or application for a 
permit, has the right to have the decision or order reviewed by the 
regional director. This section does not apply to permits or 
applications for rights-of-way. See 50 CFR 29.22 for the hearing and 
appeals procedure on rights-of-way.
    (2) Prior to making any adverse decision or order on any permit or 
an application for a noncompetitively issued permit, the refuge manager 
will notify the permittee or applicant, verbally or in writing, of the 
proposed action and its effective date. A permittee or applicant of 
noncompetitively issued permits, shall have 45 calendar days after 
notification in which to present to the refuge manager, orally or in 
writing, a statement in opposition to the proposed action or effective 
date. Notification in writing to a valid permit holder shall occur 
within 10 calendar days after receipt of the statement in opposition to 
the refuge manager's final decision or order. An applicant for a 
noncompetitively issued permit shall be notified in writing within 30 
calendar days after receipt of the statement in opposition, of the 
refuge manager's final decision or order. An applicant for a 
competitively issued permit who is not selected will not receive advance

[[Page 474]]

notice of the award decision. Such applicants, who wish to appeal the 
decision must appeal directly to the regional director within the time 
period provided for in paragraph (i)(3) of this section.
    (3) The permittee or applicant shall have 45 calendar days from the 
postmarked date of the refuge manager's final decision or order in which 
to file a written appeal to the regional director. In appeals involving 
applicants who were not selected during a competitive selection process, 
the selected applicant concurrently will have the opportunity to provide 
information to the regional director prior to the final decision. 
Selected applicants who choose to take advantage of this opportunity, 
will retain their right of appeal should the appeal of the unsuccessful 
applicant result in reversal or revision of the original decision. For 
purposes of reconsideration, appellants shall present the following 
information:
    (i) Any statement or documentation, in addition to that included in 
the initial application, permit or competitive prospectus, which 
demonstrates that the appellant satisfies the criteria set forth in the 
document under which the permit application/award was made;
    (ii) The basis for the permit applicant's disagreement with the 
decision or order being appealed; and
    (iii) Whether or not the permit applicant requests an informal 
hearing before the regional director.
    (4) The regional director will provide a hearing if requested by the 
applicant. After consideration of the written materials and oral 
hearing, and within a reasonable time, the regional director shall 
affirm, reverse, or modify the refuge manager's decision or order and 
shall set forth in writing the basis for the decision. The applicant 
must be sent a copy of the decision promptly. The decision will 
constitute final agency action.
    (5) Permittee compliance with any decision or order of a refuge 
manager shall be required during the appeal process unless the regional 
director makes a preliminary finding contrary to the refuge manager's 
decision, and prepares a written determination that such action is not 
detrimental to the interests of the United States, or upon submission 
and acceptance of a bond deemed adequate by the refuge manager to 
indemnify the United States from loss or damage.
    (j) State selection of guide-outfitters. Nothing in this section 
will prohibit the Service from cooperating with the State of Alaska in 
administering the selection of sport fishing guides and big game hunting 
guide-outfitters operating on national wildlife refuges should the State 
develop a competitive selection process which is acceptable to the 
Service.

Sec. 37.1  Purpose.

    These regulations implement the requirement of section 1002(d) of 
the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, 94 Stat. 2450, as 
amended, 16 U.S.C. 3142(d), that the Secretary establish guidelines 
governing surface geological and geophysical exploration for oil and gas 
within the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Section 
1002 mandates an oil and gas exploration program for the refuge's 
coastal plain. The program shall culminate in a report to Congress which 
contains, among other things, the identification of those areas within 
the coastal plain that have oil and gas production potential, an 
estimate of the volume of oil and gas concerned, the description of the 
wildlife, its habitat, and other resources that are within the areas 
identified, and an evaluation of the adverse effects that the carrying 
out of further exploration for, and the development and production of, 
oil and gas within such areas will have on the refuge's resources. It is 
the objective of this program to ascertain the best possible data and 
information concerning the probable existence, location, volume, and 
potential for further exploration, development, and production of oil 
and gas within the coastal plain without significantly adversely 
affecting the wildlife, its habitat, or the environment and without 
unnecessary duplication of exploratory activities. These regulations 
prescribe the requirements and procedures for obtaining authorization 
for and the conduct of such exploratory activities, and for submitting 
to the Department the resulting data and information. These regulations 
also describe other matters relating to the administration of the 
program.

    (a) The permittee shall comply and shall be responsible for the 
compliance of its officials, employees, contractors, subcontractors and 
agents with the regulations of this part, the terms and conditions of 
its special use permit, the provisions of its approved exploration plan 
and plan or operation, and all reasonable stipulations, demands and 
orders issued by the Regional Director. All actions by the permittee 
inconsistent with this part are prohibited.
    (b) The permittee shall designate a general representative who shall 
be the person primarily accountable for managing the permittee's 
authorized activities, and a field representative who shall be the 
person primarily accountable for supervising the permittee's field 
operations, and their alternates. The Regional Director shall be 
informed of the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of the persons 
designated pursuant to this paragraph and of the procedures for 
contacting them on a 24-hour basis, including the radio frequency for 
field operations, at the time the permittee submits its first plan of 
operation pursuant to Sec. 37.24. The permittee shall notify the

relieve the permittee of responsibility for compliance with applicable 
laws, its special use permit, exploration plan, plan of

[[Page 479]]

operation, and all reasonable stipulations, demands and orders of the 
Regional Director. The designee will be considered the agent of the 
permittee and will be responsible for complying fully with the 
obligations of the permittee. The serving of stipulations, demands, 
orders, and notices on the permittee's designee, when delivered 
personally or by radio or mail, will be deemed to be service upon the 
permittee. The permittee shall notify the Regional Director in writing 
when assignment of a designee has been cancelled. A designee cannot 
reassign its designation to another party. The permittee or designee 
shall notify the Regional Director 10 working days in advance of its 
intention to commence field operations for each season that it conducts 
exploratory activities.
    (d) The permittee shall submit to the Regional Director 30 days 
prior to the commencement of field operations for each year covered by 
its exploration plan an updated list of the names and addresses of all 
persons participating in the exploratory activities covered thereby or 
sharing in the data and information resulting therefrom through a cost-
sharing or any other arrangement.
    (e) The permittee shall perform operations and maintain equipment in 
a safe and workmanlike manner. The permittee shall take all reasonable 
precautions necessary to provide adequate protection for the health and 
safety of life and the protection of property and to comply with any 
health and safety requirements prescribed by the Regional Director.


<R05>
Sec. 37.13  Group participation.

    (a) To avoid unnecessary duplication of exploratory activities, the 
permittee shall, if ordered by the Regional Director, afford all 
interested persons, through a signed agreement, an opportunity to 
participate in its exploratory activities. Within 60 days following such 
order, the permittee shall provide evidence satisfactory to the Regional 
Director of its compliance therewith. The permittee shall provide the 
Regional Director with the names and addresses of all additional 
participants, as they join.
    (b) If, with the approval of the Regional Director, the permittee at 
any time changes any provisions of its approved exploration plan 
relating to areal extent, intensity of exploratory activities, or 
logistical support, and the Regional Director determines such changes to 
be significant, the Regional Director may require the permittee to 
afford all interested persons another opportunity to participate in the 
permitted exploratory activities in accordance with paragraph (a) of 
this section.
    (c) The requirements of this section do not preclude the permittee 
from initiating field operations as authorized under its special use 
permit.
    (d) All participants shall be bound by the regulations of this part, 
the permittee's special use permit, approved exploration plan and plan 
of operation and any reasonable stipulations, demands and orders issued 
by the Regional Director.


<R05>
Sec. 37.14  Bonding.

    (a) Before the issuance of its special use permit, any applicant 
whose exploration plan has been approved under Sec. 37.22 shall furnish 
to the Service a surety bond of not less than $100,000, or other 
security satisfactory to the Service, to secure performance of its 
exploration plan and plan(s) of operation and compliance with the permit 
and this part. Such surety bond shall be issued by qualified surety 
companies approved by the Department of the Treasury (see Department of 
the Treasury Circular No. 570). Such bond shall be maintained by the 
permittee for the benefit of the Service until the Regional Director 
notifies the permittee in writing that all terms and conditions of its 
exploration plan, special use permit, plan of operation, and this part 
have been met or otherwise consents to its cancellation or termination. 
Any bond furnished or maintained by a person under this section shall be 
on a form approved or prescribed by the Regional Director. The Regional 
Director may require an increase in the amount of any bond or other 
security to be furnished and any outstanding bond or security or require

[[Page 480]]

a new bond or security whenever additional coverage is needed to secure 
performance of its exploration plan and plan(s) of operation and 
compliance with the permit and this part or is needed as a consequence 
of default.
    (b) Whenever a permittee's exploration plan, plan of operation, or 
special use permit is revised or modified, the permittee shall provide 
to the Regional Director within 30 days thereafter an acknowledgement by 
the surety that its bond continues to apply to the exploration plan, 
plan of operation or special use permit, as revised or modified, unless 
a waiver of notice to the surety is contained in the bond or the surety 
is not otherwise released by the revision or modification, or unless the 
permittee provides to the Service an increased or additional bond.
    (c) Recovery of the amount specified in the permittee's bond or 
other security shall not preclude the Department from seeking specific 
performance by the permittee of any obligations not satisfied by 
enforcement of the bond or security, or compensation for any damages, 
losses or costs due to the permittee's activities which exceed the 
amount recovered, by pursuing the Department's legal remedies.

<R05>
Sec. 37.22  Approval of exploration plan.

    (a) An exploration plan shall be approved by the Regional Director 
if he determines that it satisfies the requirements of Sec. 37.21 (c) 
and (d) and is otherwise consistent with the Act and the regulations of 
this part. In order to meet the objective and limitations stated in 
Sec. 37.1, enforce the standards stated in Sec. 37.11(b), or minimize 
adverse impacts on subsistence uses, the Regional Director may approve 
or disapprove any exploration plan in whole or in part or may require, 
as a condition of approval, an applicant to conduct its exploratory 
activities in an assigned area or jointly with other applicants or to 
make such modification in its exploration plan as he considers necessary 
and appropriate to make it consistent with this part. No plan shall be 
approved if the applicant submitting it does not demonstrate to the 
reasonable satisfaction of the Regional Director its adequate technical 
and financial ability to conduct integrated and well designed 
exploratory activities in an arctic or subarctic environment, and a 
history of responsible compliance with any exploration permits that it 
or its responsible officials or partners may have previously held.
    (b) Upon receipt of an exploration plan submitted in accordance with 
Sec. 37.21(b), the Regional Director shall promptly publish notice of 
the application and text of the plan in the Federal Register and 
newspapers of general circulation in the State of Alaska. The Regional 
Director shall determine within 90 days after the plan is submitted 
whether the plan is consistent

[[Page 482]]

with this part. The Regional Director may extend this 90-day period for 
up to 30 additional days upon written notice to the applicant. Before 
making his determination, the Regional Director shall hold at least one 
public hearing in the State for the purpose of receiving public comments 
on the plan and may confer with the applicant whenever he deems it 
necessary. The Regional Director shall give the applicant written notice 
of his determination.
    (c) Whenever the Regional Director disapproves an exploration plan 
in whole or in part, he shall notify the applicant in writing of the 
reasons for his disapproval. The applicant may request the Director to 
consider that which was disapproved by the Regional Director by filing a 
written request with the Director, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 
Department of the Interior, Washington, DC 20240, within 30 days from 
the date of disapproval. Such a request shall not operate to stay the 
Regional Director's disapproval. The request shall:
    (1) State fully the basis for the applicant's disagreement with the 
Regional Director's determination;
    (2) Include any statement or documentation, in addition to that 
already submitted by the applicant with its application, which 
demonstrates that the applicant's exploration plan is consistent with 
this part; and
    (3) Indicate whether or not the applicant requests an informal 
hearing before the Director.

The Director shall provide an informal hearing if requested by the 
applicant. Within 30 days of the receipt of the applicant's request for 
reconsideration or of the applicant's hearing, if any, whichever is 
later, the Director shall affirm, reverse, or modify the Regional 
Director's determination. Written notice of the Director's decision and 
the reasons therefor shall be provided promptly to the applicant. The 
Director's decision shall constitute the final administrative decision 
of the Secretary in the matter. Nothing in this part shall be construed 
to deprive the Secretary or the Assistant Secretary for Fish and 
Wildlife and Parks of the authority to take jurisdiction at any stage of 
any appeal or request for reconsideration and render the final decision 
in the matter after holding any informal hearing that may be required, 
to review any decision of the Regional Director or Director, or to 
direct the Regional Director or Director to reconsider a decision.
    (d) The Regional Director, as a condition of approval of any 
exploration plan under this section, shall:
    (1) Require that all data and information (including processed, 
analyzed and interpreted information) obtained as a result of carrying 
out the plan shall be submitted to the Regional Director, as provided in 
Sec. 37.53;
    (2) Make such data and information available to the public, except 
that any processed, analyzed and interpreted data or information shall 
be held confidential by the Department for a period of not less than 10 
years following the submission of such data or information to the 
Regional Director or 2 years following any lease sale including the area 
within the refuge from which the information was obtained, whichever 
period is longer, as provided in Sec. 37.54; and
    (3) Require that all raw data and information obtained as a result 
of carrying out the plan shall be made available by the permittee to any 
person at fair cost.
    (e) In the course of evaluating an exploration plan, the Regional 
Director shall also evaluate the effect of the proposed exploratory 
activities on subsistence uses and needs, the availability for 
exploration of alternate areas within the coastal plain, and 
alternatives to the proposed activities which would reduce or eliminate 
the use of areas within the coastal plain needed for subsistence

Sec. 37.23  Special use permit.

    (a) Within 45 days, or sooner if practicable, of approving an 
exploration plan, or portion thereof, the Regional Director shall, 
unless prohibited by law, issue a special use permit to authorize the 
permittee to proceed with those exploratory activities described and 
approved in its exploration plan, or portion thereof, provided that the 
requirements of Sec. 37.14(a) have been satisfied. The special use 
permit may contain such terms and conditions and may be amended from 
time to time as the Regional Director deems necessary and appropriate to 
carry out the Act and this part.
    (b) Before issuing a special use permit to authorize exploration of 
lands within the coastal plain allotted pursuant to the Act of May 17, 
1906, 34 Stat. 197, as amended by the Act of August 2, 1956, 70 Stat. 
954, or on lands within the coastal plain the surface estate in which 
has been selected by or conveyed to the Kaktovik Inupiat Corporation 
pursuant to Sections 12 and 14 of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement 
Act, 85 Stat. 701 and 702, 43 U.S.C. 1611 and 1613, the Regional

Sec. 37.24  Plan of operation.

    Each approved exploration plan shall be supplemented by a written 
plan of operation for each fiscal year, or portions thereof, covered by 
the exploration plan. Each plan of operation shall specify the field 
operations for implementing that exploration plan during the year, or 
portions thereof, covered by the plan of operation. Each plan of 
operation shall be submitted to the Regional Director at least 30 days 
before field operations are to be commenced thereunder, except that any 
plan of operation supplementing a portion of an exploration plan that 
received expedited review and approval pursuant to Sec. 37.21(c) shall 
be submitted 10 days before field operations are to be commenced 
thereunder. A plan of operation shall set forth such specific 
information as is required by the Regional Director in determining 
whether the plan is consistent with the exploration plan to which it 
pertains and with this part. The permittee shall make such modifications 
in its plan of operation as are deemed at any time by the Regional 
Director to be necessary and appropriate to ensure such consistency. 
Reconsideration of the Regional Director's actions under this section 
may be obtained by employing the procedures described in Sec. 37.22(c).


<R05>
Sec. 37.25  Revision.

    (a) A permittee may request the Regional Director for permission to 
revise its approved exploration plan. Until the Regional Director grants 
the permittee's request, no revision of its exploration plan shall be 
implemented. Such request shall be deemed to be granted on the 10th 
working day following its receipt unless the Regional Director denies 
the request; advises the permittee that the proposed revision is major 
and, therefore, must satisfy the publication and hearing requirements of 
Sec. 37.22(b) before it can be acted upon; by timely written notice 
extends the period for considering the request; conditionally approves 
the proposed revision with such modifications as he stipulates are 
necessary and appropriate; or, unconditionally approves the proposed 
revision within a shorter period. No revision of an exploration plan 
shall be approved that is inconsistent with the Act or this part. 
Approval of any revision is subject to the conditions stated in Sec. 
37.22(d) to the extent that they are pertinent.
    (b) Upon 10 working days advance notice to the Regional Director of 
its proposed revision, or within such lesser period as may be concurred 
in by the Regional Director, a permittee may implement a revision of its 
plan of operation, provided that such revision is consistent with the 
exploration plan to which the plan of operation pertains and this part. 
The Regional Director may require the permittee to defer, modify, or 
rescind such revision whenever he determines that such action is 
necessary and appropriate to ensure such consistency.
    (c) Reconsideration of the Regional Director's actions under this 
section

[[Page 484]]

may be obtained by employing the procedures described in Sec. 37.22(c).

<R05>
Sec. 37.43  Suspension and modification.

    If at any time while exploratory activities are being carried out 
under an approved exploration plan and special use permit, the Regional 
Director, on the basis of information available to him, determines that 
continuation of further activities under the plan or permit will 
significantly adversely affect the refuge's wildlife, its habitat, or 
the environment, or significantly restrict subsistence uses, or that the 
permittee has failed to comply with its approved exploration plan, plan 
of operation, special use permit, any reasonable stipulation, demand or 
order of the Regional Director, or any regulation of this part, the 
Regional Director may, without any expense or liability to the 
Department, suspend activities under the plan and/or permit for such 
time, or make such modifications to the plan and/or permit, or both 
suspend and so modify, as he determines necessary and appropriate. Such 
suspensions shall state the reasons therefore and be effective 
immediately upon receipt of the notice. Suspensions issued orally shall 
be followed by a written notice confirming the action within 3 days, and 
all written notices will be sent by messenger or registered mail, return 
receipt requested. A suspension shall remain in effect until the basis 
for the suspension has been corrected to the satisfaction of the 
Regional Director. For good cause, the Regional Director may also grant 
at the permittee's request, a written waiver of any provision of its 
special use permit, so long as such waiver will not be likely to result 
in significant adverse effects on the refuge's resources. 
Reconsideration of the Regional Director's actions under this section 
may be obtained by employing the procedures described in Sec. 37.22(c). 
A request for reconsideration shall not operate to stay the Regional

the applicant shall be responsible for such costs incurred by the 
Department in preparing the applicant's permit up to the date on which 
the Regional Director receives written notice of the applicant's 
withdrawal and for costs subsequently incurred by the Department in 
terminating permit preparation and issuance.
    (3) When two or more applications are filed which the Regional 
Director determines to be in competition with each other, each applicant 
shall reimburse the Department for such actual costs incurred in 
processing its exploration plan and special use permit, if issued, 
except that those costs which are not readily identifiable with one of 
the applicants, shall be paid by each of the applicants in equal shares.
    (c) Upon issuance of a special use permit, the permittee shall make 
an initial advance payment covering that current fiscal year quarter and 
quarterly payments thereafter to cover the actual costs incurred by the 
Department in administering the permittee's permit for its duration.

and this part; performing the permittee's obligations pursuant to Sec. 
37.31(a); and identifying, evaluating and preserving historic, 
archeological and cultural resources in areas to be explored by the 
permittee. Each quarterly payment will be paid at the outset of the 
quarter and will cover the estimated cost of that quarter as adjusted by 
the Regional Director by reason of any adjustment warranted by paragraph 
(b) of this section or by overpayments or underpayments in previous 
quarters for which adjustment has not already been made. Upon 
termination of the permittee's special use permit, reimbursement or

Director on the basis of the best available cost information. However, 
reimbursement shall not be limited to the Regional Director's estimate 
if actual costs exceed projected estimates.
    (e) All payments required by this section shall be made payable to 
the Service. No applicant or permittee shall set off or otherwise deduct 
any debt due to or any sum claimed to be owed to it by the United States 
from any payment required by this section. Overpayments shall be 
credited or refunded to the person making them.

a permittee under Sec. 37.42 shall be deemed to be costs paid to the 
Department in kind for services rendered in inspecting and monitoring 
the permittee's exploratory activities. At the end of each quarter, the 
permittee shall furnish the Regional Director with a report, in a format 
approved or prescribed by him,

[[Page 491]]

the individuals to whom they were provided.
    (h) Any dispute between an applicant or permittee and the Regional 
Director as to costs actually incurred by the Department and charged to

<R05>
Sec. 37.47  Civil penalties.

    (a) This section prescribes the procedures for assessing a civil 
penalty for the violation of any provision of an approved exploration 
plan, any term or condition of the special use permit issued under Sec. 
37.23, or any prohibition contained in this part. The civil penalty 
remedy afforded by this section is in addition to all other remedies 
available to the Secretary.
    (b) Notice of violation. (1) The notice of violation shall be issued 
by the Solicitor and served personally or by registered mail upon the 
person named in the notice (hereinafter the respondent) or his 
authorized representative. The notice shall contain:
    (i) A summary of the facts believed to show a violation by the 
respondent;
    (ii) A specific reference to the provision, term, condition or 
prohibition allegedly violated; and
    (iii) The amount of the penalty proposed to be assessed. The notice 
may also contain an initial proposal for compromise or settlement of the 
action.
    (2) The notice of violation shall also advise respondent of his 
right to:
    (i) Respond to the notice within 45 calendar days from the date of 
its issuance by: (A) Undertaking informal discussions with the 
Solicitor; (B) Accepting the proposed penalty or the compromise, if any, 
offered in the notice; or (C) Filing a petition for relief in accordance 
with paragraph (c) of this section; or

Such response must be received by the Solicitor on or before the 45th 
day during normal business hours at the address stated in the notice.
    (3) Any notice of violation may be amended, but any nontechnical 
amendment will extend the running of the respondent's 45 day period for 
response from the date of the notice to the date of the amendment.
    (4) Acceptance of the proposed penalty or the compromise, if any, 
stated in the notice of violation shall be deemed to be a waiver of the 
notice of assessment required in paragraph (d) of this section and of 
the respondent's right to an opportunity for a hearing described in 
paragraph (e) of this section.
    (c) Petition for relief. If the respondent chooses, he may ask that 
no penalty be assessed or that the amount be reduced and he may admit or 
contest the legal sufficiency of the Solicitor's charges and allegations 
of facts, by filing a petition for relief at the address specified in 
the notice within 45 calendar days from the date thereof. Such petition 
must be received by the Solicitor on or before the 45th day during 
normal business hours. The petition shall be in writing and signed by 
the respondent. If the respondent is a corporation, partnership, 
association or agency, the petition must be signed by an officer or 
official authorized to sign such document. It must set forth in full the 
legal or other reasons for the relief requested.
    (d) Notice of assessment. (1) After 45 calendar days from the date 
of the notice of violation or any amendment thereof, the Solicitor may 
proceed to determine whether the respondent committed the violation 
alleged and to determine the amount of civil penalty to be assessed, 
taking into consideration the information available and such showing as 
may have been made by the respondent. The Solicitor shall notify the 
respondent of his determinations by a written notice of assessment, 
which shall also set forth the basis for his determinations. The notice 
of assessment shall be served on the respondent personally or by 
registered mail.
    (2) The notice of assessment shall also advise the respondent of his 
right to request a hearing on the matter in accordance with paragraph 
(e) of this section.

[[Page 492]]

    (e) Request for a hearing. Within 45 calendar days from the date of 
the issuance of the notice of assessment, the respondent may request a 
hearing to be conducted on the matter in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 554 
through 557 by filing a dated, written request for hearing with the 
Hearings Division, Office of Hearings and Appeals, Department of the 
Interior, 801 North Quincy Street, Arlington, Virginia 22203. Such 
request must be received at this address on or before the 45th day 
during normal business hours. The respondent shall state the 
respondent's preference as to the place and date for a hearing. The 
request must enclose a copy of the notice of violation and the notice of 
assessment. A copy of the request shall be served upon the Solicitor 
personally or by mail at the address specified in the notice of 
assessment.
    (f) Finality of decision. If no request for a hearing is filed in 
accordance with this section, the assessment stated in the notice of 
assessment shall be effective and constitute the final administrative 
decision of the Secretary on the 45th calandar day from the date of the 
notice of assessment. If the request for hearing is timely filed in 
accordance with this section, the date of the final administrative 
decision in the matter shall be as provided in paragraph (g) or (h) of 
this section. When a civil penalty assessed under this section becomes 
final, the respondent shall have 20 calendar days from the date of the 
final administrative decision within which to make full payment of the 
penalty assessed. Payment will be timely only if received in the Office 
of the Solicitor during normal business hours on or before the 20th day.
    (g) Hearing. (1) Upon receipt of a request for a hearing, the 
Hearings Division will assign an administrative law judge who shall have 
all the powers accorded by law and necessary to preside over the parties 
and the hearing and to make decisions in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 554 
through 557. Notice of such assignment shall be given promptly to the 
respondent and to the Solicitor at the address stated in the notice of 
assessment. Upon notice of the assignment of an administrative law judge 
to the case, the Solicitor shall file all correspondence and petitions 
exchanged between the Solicitor and the respondent which shall become a 
part of the hearing record.
    (2) The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 554 
through 557 and with 43 CFR part 4 to the extent that it is not 
inconsistent with this part. Subject to 43 CFR 1.3, the respondent may 
appear in person, by representative, or by counsel. The hearing shall be 
held in a location established by the administrative law judge, giving 
due regard to the convenience of the parties, their representatives and 
witnesses. Failure to appear at the time set for hearing shall be deemed 
a waiver of the right to a hearing and consent to the decision on the 
record made at the hearing. The judge shall render a written decision on 
the record, which shall set forth his findings of facts and conclusions 
of law and the reasons therefore, and an assessment of a civil penalty 
if he determines that the respondent committed the violation charged.
    (3) Discovery shall be obtained by employing the procedures 
described 43 CFR 4.1130 through 4.1141. In addition, discovery of facts 
known and opinions held by experts, otherwise discoverable under 43 CFR 
4.1132(a) and acquired and developed in anticipation of administrative 
adjudication or litigation, may be obtained only as follows:
    (i)(A) A party through interrogatories require any other party to 
identify each person whom the other party expects to call as an expert 
witness, to state the subject matter on which the expert is expected to 
testify, and to state the substance of the facts and opinions to which 
the expert is expected to testify and a summary of the grounds for each 
opinion.
    (B) Upon motion, the administrative law judge may order further 
discovery by other means, subject to such restrictions as to scope and 
such provisions under paragraph (g)(3)(iii) of this section concerning 
fees and expenses, as the administrative law judge may deem appropriate.
    (ii) A party may discover facts known or opinions held by an expert, 
who has been retained or employed by another party in anticipation of 
administrative adjudication or litigation or

[[Page 493]]

preparation therefore and who is not expected to be called as a witness, 
only upon a showing of exceptional circumstances under which it is 
impracticable for the party seeking discovery to obtain facts or 
opinions on the same subject by other means.
    (iii) Unless manifest injustice would result, (A) the administrative 
law judge shall require the party seeking discovery to pay the expert, 
or the Department if the expert is an employee of the United States, a 
reasonable fee for time spent in responding to paragraphs (g)(3)(i)(B) 
and (g)(3)(ii) of this section; and (B) with respect to discovery under 
paragraph (g)(3)(i)(B) of this section the administrative law judge may 
require and with respect to discovery under paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this 
section the administrative law judge shall require, the party seeking 
discovery to pay the other party a fair portion of the fees and expenses 
reasonably incurred by the latter party in obtaining facts and opinions 
from the expert.
    (4) Unless the notice of appeal is filed in accordance with 
paragraph (h) of this section, the administrative law judge's decision 
shall constitute the final administrative decision of the Secretary in 
the matter and shall become effective 30 calendar days from the date of 
the decision.
    (h) Appeal. (1) Either the respondent or the Solicitor may seek an 
appeal from the decision of an administrative law judge as to the 
respondent's violation or penalty or both by the filing of a notice of 
appeal with the Director, Office of Hearings and Appeals, United States 
Department of the Interior, 801 North Quincy Street, Arlington, Virginia 
22203, within 30 calendar days of the date of the administrative law 
judge's decision. Such notice shall be accompanied by proof of service 
on the administrative law judge and the opposing party.
    (2) Upon receipt of such a request, the Director, Office of Hearings 
and Appeals, shall appoint an ad hoc appeals board to determine whether 
an appeal should be granted, and to hear and decide an appeal. To the 
extent they are not inconsistent herewith, the provisions of 43 CFR part 
4, subpart G shall apply to appeal proceedings under this paragraph. The 
determination of the board to grant or deny an appeal, as well as its 
decision on the merits of an appeal, shall be in writing and become 
effective as the final administrative determination of the Secretary in 
the matter on the date it is rendered, unless otherwise specified 
therein.
    (i) Amount of penalty. The amount of any civil penalty assessed 
under this section shall not exceed $10,000 for each violation. Each day 
of a continuing violation shall, however, constitute a separate offense. 
In determining the amount of such penalty, the nature, circumstances, 
extent, and gravity of the violation committed, and, with respect to the 
respondent, his history of any prior offenses, his demonstrated good 
faith in attempting to achieve timely compliance after being cited for 
the violation, and such other matters as justice may require shall be 
considered.
    (j) Petition for remission. The Solicitor may modify or remit, with 
or without conditions, any civil penalty which is subject to imposition 
or which has been imposed under this paragraph unless the matter is 
pending in court for judicial review or for recovery of the civil 
penalty assessed. A petition for remission may be filed by the 
respondent with the Solicitor at any time from the date of the notice of 
violation referred to in paragraph (b) of this section until 90 days 
after the date of final administrative decision assessing a civil 
penalty. The petition must set forth in full the legal and other reasons 
for the relief requested. Any petition that is not timely filed will not 
receive consideration. The Solicitor's decision shall be the final 
administrative decision for the Secretary on the petition.

and wildlife-oriented resources of the State for which the agency has 
authority under State law.
    (c) A diversion of license fee revenues occurs when any portion of 
license revenues is used for any purpose other than the administration 
of the State fish and wildlife agency.
    (d) If a diversion of license revenues occurs, the State becomes 
ineligible to participate under the pertinent Act from the date the 
diversion is declared by the Director until:
    (1) Adequate legislative prohibitions are in place to prevent 
diversion of license revenue, and
    (2) All license revenues or assets acquired with license revenues 
are restored, or an amount equal to license revenue diverted or current 
market value of assets diverted (whichever is greater) is returned and 
properly available for use for the administration of the State fish and 
wildlife agency.

    (1) Trapping licenses, commercial licenses, and other licenses which 
are not for the express purpose of permitting the holder to hunt or fish 
for sport or recreation shall not be included.
    (2) Licenses which do not return net revenue to the State shall not 
be included. To qualify as a paid license, the fee must produce revenue 
for the State. Net revenue is any amount returned to the State after 
deducting agent or sellers fees and the cost for printing, distribution, 
control or other costs directly associated with the issuance of each 
license.
    (3) Licenses valid for more than one year, either a specific or 
indeterminate number of years, may be counted in each of the years for 
which they are valid; provided that:
    (i) The net revenue from each license is commensurate with the 
period for which hunting or fishing privileges are granted, and
    (ii) Sampling or other techniques are used to determine whether the 
licensee remains a license holder in the year of certification.
    (4) Combination fishing and hunting licenses (a single license which 
permits the holder both to hunt and fish) shall be included in the 
determination of both the number of paid hunting license holders and the 
number of persons holding paid licenses to fish for sport or recreation.
    (5) Some licensing systems require or permit an individual to hold 
more than one license to hunt or to fish in a State. Such an individual 
shall not be counted more than once as a hunting or fishing license 
holder. The State fish and wildlife director, in certifying license 
information to the Director, is responsible for eliminating duplication 
or multiple counting of single individuals in the figures which he 
certifies. Sampling and other statistical techniques may be utilized by 
the certifying officer for this purpose.

Sec. 80.23  Allocation of funds between marine and freshwater fishery

projects.

    (a) Each coastal State, to the extent practicable, shall equitably 
allocate those funds specified by the Secretary, in the apportionment of 
Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration funds, between projects having 
recreational benefits for marine fisheries and projects having 
recreational benefits for freshwater fisheries.
    (1) Coastal States are: Alabama, Alaska, California, Connecticut, 
Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, 
Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North 
Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, 
Washington, Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, Guam, 
American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.
    (2) The allocation and subsequent obligation of funds between 
projects that benefit marine and freshwater interests will be in the 
same proportion as the estimated number of resident marine anglers and 
resident freshwater anglers, respectively, bears to the estimated number 
of total resident anglers in the State. The number of marine and 
freshwater anglers shall be based on a statistically reliable method for 
determining the relative distribution of resident anglers in the State 
between those that fish in saltwater and those that fish in freshwater.
    (3) To the extent practicable means that the amounts allocated of 
each year's apportionment may not necessarily result in an equitable 
allocation for each year. However, the amounts allocated over a period, 
not to exceed 3 years, must result in an equitable allocation between 
marine and freshwater fisheries projects. Ongoing marine project costs 
can be applied toward the State's saltwater allocation.
    (4) Failure to provide for an equitable allocation may result in the 
State's becoming ineligible to participate in the use of those funds 
specified, until such time as the State demonstrates to the 
satisifaction of the Director that funds will be allocated equitably.

(including those existing structures for which maintenance is provided) 
must be for the purpose of providing additional, improved, or safer 
access of public waters for boating recreation as part of the State's 
effort for the restoration, management, and public use of sport fish. 
Though a broad range of access facilities and associated amenities can 
qualify for funding under the 10 percent provision, power boats with 
common horsepower ratings must be accommodated, and, in addition, the 
State must make reasonable efforts to accommodate boats with larger 
horsepower ratings if they would not conflict with aquatic resources 
management. Any portion of the 10 percent set aside for the above 
purposes that remains unexpended or unobligated after two years shall 
revert to FWS.

Sec. 80.27  Information collection requirements.

    (a) Information gathering requirements include filling out forms to 
apply for certain benefits offered by the Federal Government. 
Information gathered under this part is authorized under the Federal Aid 
in Sport Fish Restoration Act (16 U.S.C. 777-7771) and the Federal Aid 
in Wildlife Restoration Act (16 U.S.C. 669-669i). The Service may not 
conduct or sponsor, and applicants or grantees are not required to 
respond to, a collection of information

[[Page 513]]

unless the request displays a currently valid OMB control number. Our 
requests for information will be used to apportion funds and to review 
and make decisions on grant applications and reimbursement payment 
requests submitted to the Federal Aid Program.
    (b) OMB Circular A-102 requires the use of several Standard Forms: 
SF-424, SF-424A and SF-424B, SF-424C, SF-424D, SF-269A and SF-269B, SF-
270, SF-271 and SF-272 (For availability, see 5 CFR 1310.3.). Combined, 
as many as 12,000 of these forms are used annually by grant applicants. 
The individual burden is approximately 1 hour to compile information and 
complete each form; the total burden is approximately 12,000 hours 
(approximately 3,500 grants are awarded/renewed each year, but not all 
forms are used for all grants). These forms are needed to document grant 
applications and requests for reimbursement.
    (c) Part 1 Certification (Service Form 3-154A, OMB Control No. 1018-
0007) and Part 2 Summary of Hunting and Sport Fishing Licenses Issued 
(Service Form 3-154B, OMB Control No. 1018-0007) require approximately 
one-half hour from each of 56 respondent States and territories for a 
total burden of 28 hours. The information is routinely collected by the 
States and territories and easily transferred to these forms and 
certified. This information is used in a statutory formula to apportion 
funds among the grant recipients.
    (d) The Grant Agreement, (Service Form 3-1552, OMB Control No. 1018-
0049) and Amendment to Grant Agreement, (Service Form 3-1591, OMB 
Control No. 1018-0049) require approximately 1 hour to gather relevant 
information, review, type, and sign. This information is compiled in the 
normal agency planning processes and transferred to these forms. 
Recipients nationwide complete approximately 3,500 Grant Agreement forms 
and 1,750 Amendment to Grant Agreement forms during any fiscal year for 
a total burden of 5,250 hours. This information is used to document 
financial awards made to grant recipients and amendments to these 
awards.
    (e) The Federal Aid Grant Application Booklet (OMB Control No. 1018-
0109) contains narrative instruction for applying for grants. It 
requires approximately 80 hours to collect information and prepare a 
grant application package. Applicants prepare and submit about 5,250 of 
these grant application packages annually for a total burden of 283,500 
hours. This information is used to determine if the work, cost, and 
future benefits of a grant application meet the needs of the Federal Aid 
in Sport Fish and Wildlife Restoration programs.
    (f) The public is invited to submit comments on the accuracy of the 
estimated average burden hours needed for completing Part I--
Certification, Part II--Summary of Hunting and Sport Fishing Licenses 
Issued, Grant Agreement, Amendment to Grant Agreement, or The Federal 
Aid Grant Application Booklet and to suggest ways in which the burden 
may be reduced. Comments may be submitted to: U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service, Information Collection Clearance Officer, 4401 North Fairfax 
Drive, Suite 222, Arlington, VA 22203.

<R05>
Sec. 81.2  Cooperation with the States.

    The Secretary is authorized by the act to cooperate with any State 
which establishes and maintains an adequate and active program for the 
conservation of various endangered and threatened species. In order for 
a State program to be deemed an adequate and active program, the 
Secretary must find and reconfirm, on an annual basis, that under the 
State program, either:
    (a) Authority resides in the State agency to conserve resident 
species of fish and wildlife or plants determined by the State agency or 
the Secretary to be endangered or threatened;
    (b) The State agency has established an acceptable conservation 
program, consistent with the purposes and policies of the act, for all 
residents species of fish and wildlife or plants in the State which are 
deemed by the Secretary to be endangered or threatened; and has 
furnished a copy of such program together with all pertinent details, 
information, and data requested to the Secretary;
    (c) The State agency is authorized to conduct investigations to 
determine the status and requirements for survival of resident species 
of fish and wildlife or plants;
    (d) The State agency is authorized to establish programs, including 
the acquisition of land or aquatic habitat or interests therein, for the 
conservation of resident endangered or threatened species; and
    (e) Provisions are made for public participation in designating 
resident species of fish and wildlife or plants as endangered or 
threatened, or that under the State program: (1) The requirements set 
forth in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section are complied with 
concerning fish and wildlife and in paragraphs (c) and (e) of this 
section concerning plants, and plans are included under which immediate 
attention will be given to those resident species of fish and wildlife 
or plants which are determined by the Secretary or the State agency to 
be endangered or threatened and which the Secretary and the State agency 
agree are most urgently in need of conservation programs; except that a 
cooperative agreement entered into with a State whose program is deemed 
adequate and active pursuant to this paragraph shall not affect the 
applicability of prohibitions set forth in or authorized pursuant to 
section 4(d) or section 9(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 
with respect to the taking of any resident endangered or threatened 
species.

<R05>
Sec. 81.3  Cooperative Agreement.

    Upon determination by the Secretary that a State program is adequate 
and active and complies with Sec. 81.2, the Secretary shall enter into 
an Agreement with the State. A Cooperative Agreement is necessary before 
a Project Agreement can be approved for endangered or threatened species 
projects. A cooperative agreement under Sec. 81.2 must be reconfirmed 
annually to reflect new laws, species lists, rules and regulations, and 
programs, and to demonstrate that the program is still active and 
adequate. The Secretary, in determining which species are most urgently 
in need of a conservation program as provided for in Sec. 81.2(e), 
shall apply the following criteria: (1) The degree of threat to the 
continued existence of the species; (2) the recovery potential of the 
species; (3) the taxonomic status, e.g., giving full species priority 
over subspecies or populations; and (4) such other relevent biological 
factors as determined appropriate.

such terms and conditions as he deems necessary, and after review by the 
Marine Mammal Commission, to make grants, or provide other forms of 
financial assistance, for the purpose of undertaking research relevant 
to the protection and conservation of marine mammals. Research initiated 
pursuant to this authorization is to be directed toward increasing the 
available knowledge of the ecology and population dynamics of marine 
mammals and of the factors which bear upon their ability to reproduce 
themselves successfully, which information may be used for the purposes 
of increasing and maintaining the number of animals within species and 
populations of marine mammals at the optimum carrying capacity of their 
habitat.


<R05>
Sec. 82.3  Supplementary information and procedures.

    The regulations in this part are intended to provide for the maximum 
flexiblity and simplicity in the application and award of grants or 
other financial assistance and the minimum amount of Federal control in

funds. With respect to grants to state or local governments these 
regulations are intended to implement and be read as consistent with 
Federal Management Circular 74-7, ``Uniform Administrative Requirements 
for Grants-in-Aid to State and Local Governments,'' (FMC 74-7) 34 CFR 
part 256, 39 FR 35787-35796, October 4, 1974, unless specifically noted 
otherwise. The standards and procedures set forth therein, and other 
referenced Federal management circulars, will, to the extent practical, 
govern other forms of financial assistance to state and local 
governments, public and private institutions and persons as well as 
grants to such institutions and persons. Other Federal regulations and 
sources of guidance potential applicants may find worthwhile to consult 
for information which may be helpful in applying and implementing 
research grants or other financial assistance under these regulations 
include: 34 CFR part 211, Cost Sharing on Federal Research (FMC 73-3);

                      Subpart A_General Background


<R05>
Sec. 84.10  What is the purpose and scope of this rule?

    The regulations in this part establish the requirements for coastal 
State participation in the National Coastal Wetlands Conservation Grant 
Program authorized by Section 305 of the Coastal Wetlands Planning, 
Protection and Restoration Act (Pub L. 101-646, title III; 16 U.S.C. 
3954). The primary goal of the National Coastal Wetlands Conservation 
Grant Program is the long-term conservation of coastal wetlands 
ecosystems. It accomplishes this by helping States protect, restore, and 
enhance their coastal habitats through a competitive grants program. 
Results are measured in acres protected, restored, and enhanced.


<R05>
Sec. 84.11  How does the Service define the terms used in this rule?

    Terms used have the following meaning in this part:
    Coastal barrier. A depositional geologic feature that is subject to 
wave, tidal, and wind energies; protects landward aquatic habitats from 
direct wave attack; and includes all associated aquatic habitats such as 
adjacent wetlands, marshes, estuaries, inlets, and nearshore waters. 
These can include islands; spits of land connected to a mainland at one 
end; sand bars that connect two headlands and enclose aquatic habitat; 
broad, sandy, dune beaches; or fringing mangroves. Coastal barriers are 
found on coastlines including major embayments and the Great Lakes of 
the United States and its territories.
    Coastal Barrier Resources System. A defined set of undeveloped 
coastal areas, designated by the Coastal Barrier Resources Act of 1982 
(Pub. L. 97-348) and the Coastal Barrier Improvement Act of 1990 (Pub. 
L. 101-591). Within these defined units of the System, Federal 
expenditures are restricted to discourage development of coastal 
barriers.
    Coastal States. States bordering the Great Lakes (Illinois, Indiana, 
Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin); 
States bordering the Atlantic, Gulf (except Louisiana), and Pacific 
coasts (Alabama, Alaska, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, 
Georgia, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New 
Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, 
South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, and Washington); and American Samoa, 
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the 
Virgin Islands. (Louisiana is not included because it has its own 
wetlands conservation program authorized by the Coastal Wetlands 
Planning, Protection and Restoration Act and implemented by the Corps of 
Engineers with assistance from the State of Louisiana, the Environmental 
Protection Agency, and the Departments of the Interior, Agriculture, and 
Commerce.)
    Coastal wetland ecosystems. Ecosystems that consist of multiple, 
interrelated coastal land features. They include wetlands in drainage 
basins of estuaries or coastal waters that contain saline, brackish, and 
nearshore waters; coastlines and adjacent lands; adjacent freshwater and 
intermediate wetlands that interact as an ecological unit; and river 
mouths and those portions of major river systems affected by tidal 
influence--all of which interact as an integrated ecological unit. 
Shorelands, dunes, nearshore islands, barrier islands and associated 
headlands, and freshwater wetlands within estuarine drainages are 
included in the definition since these interrelated features are 
critical to coastal fish, wildlife, and their habitats.
    The definition of a coastal wetland ecosystem also applies to the 
Great Lakes and their watersheds, where freshwater plays a similar 
hydrologic role. The Great Lakes coastal wetland ecosystem is made up of 
multiple interrelated coastal landscape features along the Great Lakes. 
The Great Lakes coastal wetland ecosystem includes wetlands located 
adjacent to any of the Great Lakes including Lake St. Clair and 
connecting waters, and mouths of river or stream systems

[[Page 529]]

draining directly into the Great Lakes. Shorelands, dunes, offshore 
islands, and barrier islands and associated headlands are included in 
the definition since these interrelated features are critical to Great 
Lakes fish, wildlife, and their habitats.
    Coastal Wetlands Act or Act. The Coastal Wetlands Planning, 
Protection and Restoration Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 3951-3956).
    Eligible applicant. Any agency or agencies of a coastal State 
designated by the Governor. It is usually a State natural resource or 
fish and wildlife agency.
    Enhancement. The manipulation of the physical, chemical, or 
biological characteristics of a wetland (undisturbed or degraded) site 
to heighten, intensify, or improve specific function(s) or to change the 
growth stage or composition of the vegetation present.
    Fund. A fund established and used by a coastal State for acquiring 
coastal wetlands, other natural areas, or open spaces. The fund can be a 
trust fund from which the principal is not spent, or a fund derived from 
a dedicated recurring source of monies including, but not limited to, 
real estate transfer fees or taxes, cigarette taxes, tax checkoffs, or 
motor vehicle license plate fees.
    Grant. An award of financial assistance by the Federal Government to 
an eligible applicant.
    Long-term conservation. Protecting and restoring terrestrial and 
aquatic environments for at least 20 years. This includes the hydrology, 
water quality, and fish and wildlife that depend on these environments.
    Maintenance. (These activities are ineligible under the program; the 
definition is included to distinguish these activities from acquisition, 
restoration, enhancement, and management.) Maintenance includes those 
activities necessary for upkeep of a facility or habitat. These 
activities include routine, recurring custodial maintenance such as 
housekeeping and minor repairs as well as the supplies, materials, and 
tools necessary to carry out the work. Also included is nonroutine 
cyclical maintenance to keep facilities or habitat improvements fully 
functional. Cyclical maintenance is major maintenance or renovation 
activities conducted at intervals normally greater than 1 year.
    Management. (Includes habitat management only.) Habitat management 
includes vegetation manipulation and restoration of habitat to support 
fish and wildlife populations. Creation of wetlands where they did not 
previously exist is not included in the definition of management.
    Maritime forest. Maritime forests are defined, for the purposes of 
this regulation, as broad-leaved forests that occur on barrier islands 
and along the mainland coast from Delaware to Texas. Examples are 
primarily characterized by a closed canopy of various combinations of 
live oak (Quercus virginiana), upland laurel oak (Quercus 
hemisphaerica), pignut hickory (Carya glabra), southern magnolia 
(Magnolia grandiflora), sugarberry (Celtis laevigata), and cabbage palm 
(Sabal palmetto). Shrubs and smaller trees typical of the understory 
include live oak, upland laurel oak, pignut hickory, red mulberry (Morus 
rubra), wild olive (Osmanthus americanus), American holly (Ilex opaca), 
yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), beautyberry (Callicarpa americana), bumelia 
(Sideraxylon spp.), and small-flowered pawpaw (Asimina parviflora). The 
herb layer is generally rich and diverse, typically including 
partridgeberry (Mitchella repens), coralbean (Erythrina herbacea), 
small-leaved milk pea (Galactia microphylla), tick trefoils (Desmodium 
spp.), and spikegrass (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum). Vines are 
represented by muscadine grape (Vitis rotundifolia), Virginia creeper 
(Parrhenocissus quinquefolia), and various briers (Smilax spp.).
    This natural community type becomes established on old coastal dunes 
that have been stabilized long enough to sustain forests. In time, the 
accumulation of humus contributes to moisture retention of soils, while 
the canopy minimizes temperature fluctuations by reducing soil warming 
during the day and heat loss at night. Because of the underlying deep 
sands, maritime forests are generally well-drained.
    Maritime forests have become prime resort and residential property 
because of their relatively protected locations

[[Page 530]]

along the coast. Although this community type originally occurred in 
virtually continuous strips along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, 
residential developments and infrastructure encroachments have severely 
fragmented most occurrences.
    National Wetlands Inventory. A Service program that produces 
information on the characteristics, extent, and status of the Nation's 
wetlands and deepwater habitat. The program's strongest mandates come 
from the Emergency Wetlands Resources Act of 1986 (16 U.S.C. 3901), 
which directs the Service to map wetlands, conduct wetlands status and 
trends studies, and disseminate the information produced.
    National Wetlands Priority Conservation Plan. A plan developed by 
the Service for the U.S. Department of the Interior at the direction of 
Congress through the Emergency Wetlands Resources Act of 1986 (16 U.S.C. 
3901). The plan provides the criteria and guidance for identifying 
wetlands that warrant attention for Federal and State acquisition using 
Land and Water Conservation Fund appropriations.
    Operations. (These activities are ineligible under the program; the 
definition is included to distinguish these activities from acquisition, 
restoration, enhancement, and management.) Operations include activities 
necessary for the functioning of a facility or habitat to produce 
desired results. These include public use management and facility 
management.
    Program. The National Coastal Wetlands Conservation Grant Program. A 
program administered by the Service that awards Federal grants through a 
competitive process to State agencies for projects to acquire, restore, 
manage, or enhance coastal wetlands.
    Project. One or more related activities necessary to fulfill a 
stated objective to provide for the long-term conservation of coastal 
wetlands including the lands and waters, hydrology, water quality, and 
wetland-dependent wildlife. These activities can include acquisition, 
restoration, enhancement, or management of coastal wetlands.
    Restoration. The manipulation of the physical, chemical, or 
biological characteristics of a site with the goal of returning natural/
historic functions to a former or degraded wetland.


<R05>

reporting requirements?

    (a) Information collection requirements include:
    (1) An Application for Federal Assistance (Standard Form 424);
    (2) A proposal, following the guidance of OMB Circular A-102 and the 
Federal Aid Grant Application Booklet (OMB Control Number 1018-0109), 
that includes statements of need and objective(s); a description of 
expected results or benefits; the approach to be used, such as 
procedures, schedules, key personnel and cooperators, location of the 
proposed action, and estimated costs to accomplish the objective(s); 
identification of any other actions that may relate to the grant; and a 
description of public involvement and interagency coordination;
    (3) Discussion of ranking criteria, including a completed summary 
information form (USFWS Form 3-2179);
    (4) Assurances of compliance with all applicable Federal laws, 
regulations, and policies (SF 424B or SF 424D); and
    (5) Documents, as appropriate, supporting the proposal; for example, 
environmental assessments (including the NEPA compliance checklist, 
USFWS Form 3-2185) and evaluations of effects on threatened and 
endangered species.
    (6) A grant agreement form if the proposal is selected for an award 
(USFWS Form 3-1552); and
    (7) A grant amendment form if the agreement is modified (USFWS Form 
3-1591).
    (b) Record-keeping requirements include the tracking of costs and 
accomplishments related to the grant as required by 43 CFR 12.60, 
monitoring and reporting program performance (43 CFR 12.80), and 
financial reporting (43 CFR 12.81). The project report should include 
information about the acres conserved, with a breakdown by conservation 
method (for example, acquired, restored, or both) and type of habitat 
(list habitat types and include the acreage of each). Are the results of 
the project being monitored? Is there evidence that the resources 
targeted in the proposal (for example, anadromous

[[Page 531]]

fish, threatened and endangered species, and migratory birds) have 
benefited?
    (c) Reporting requirements include retention and access requirements 
as specified in 43 CFR 12.82 and authorized by OMB through the Federal 
Aid Grant Application Booklet (OMB Control Number 1018-0109).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) The Program operates on an annual cycle. Regional Federal Aid 
Offices request proposals from the States in early April. Proposals must 
be received by the Regional Director on or before a due date set in 
early June in order to be considered for funding in the following fiscal 
year. Check with your Regional Office each year for the exact due dates. 
Regions review proposals for eligibility and substantiality. Regions may 
rank eligible and substantial proposals and submit them to the national 
office of the Service in Washington, DC, by a date set in late June. A 
Review Panel coordinated by the Service's National Office of Fisheries 
and Habitat Conservation reviews and ranks proposals in early August 
using the criteria established in this rule. The Director selects the 
proposals and announces the grant recipients at the beginning of the new 
fiscal year (October 1).
    (c) More than one agency in a State may submit proposals to the 
Service if the Governor determines that more than one agency has 
responsibility for coastal wetlands.
    (d) A project proposal that includes several separate and distinct 
phases may be submitted in phases, but any succeeding phases must 
compete against other proposals in the year submitted. Obtaining money 
for one phase of a project will not be contingent upon acquiring money 
for another phase of that same project.
    (e) The Federal (Program) share will not exceed $1 million per 
project.
    (f) The percentage of non-Federal match (cash or in-kind) must not 
be less than 25 percent of the total costs if the State has a designated 
fund or not less than 50 percent without a fund.


<R05>
Sec. 84.22  What needs to be included in grant proposals?

    Proposals must include the following:
    (a) Application for Federal Assistance (Standard Form 424);
    (b) A Statement of Assurances of compliance with applicable Federal 
laws, regulations, and policies (either Standard Form 424B or 424D); and
    (c) A project statement that identifies and describes:
    (1) The need within the purposes of the Act;
    (2) Discrete, quantifiable, and verifiable objective(s) to be 
accomplished during a specified time period;
    (3) Expected results or benefits, in terms of coastal lands and 
waters, the hydrology, water quality, or fish and wildlife dependent on 
the wetlands;
    (4) The approach to be used in meeting the objectives, including 
specific procedures, schedules, key personnel, and cooperators;
    (5) A project location, including two maps: A map of the State 
showing the general location of the proposal, and a map of the project 
site;
    (6) Estimated costs to attain the objective(s) (the various 
activities or components of each project should be broken down by cost 
and by cooperator);
    (7) If the request is more than $100,000 (Federal share), the 
applicant must submit a Form DI-2010, certifying that the grant money 
will not be used for lobbying activities;
    (8) A concise statement, with documentation, of how the proposal 
addresses each of the 13 numeric criteria including a summary using FWS 
Form No. 3-2179 (see Sec. 84.32);
    (9) A description of the State trust fund that supports a request 
for a 75

[[Page 533]]

percent Federal share in sufficient detail for the Service to make an 
eligibility determination, or a statement that eligibility has been 
previously approved and no change has occurred in the fund;
    (10) A list of other current coastal acquisition, restoration, 
enhancement, and management actions; agency(ies) involved; relationship 
to the proposed grant; and how the proposal fits into comprehensive 
natural resource plans for the area, if any; and
    (11) Public involvement or interagency coordination on coastal 
wetlands conservation projects that has occurred or is planned that 
relates to this proposal (Specify the organizations or agencies involved 
and dates of involvement.).


<R04>
                       Subpart C_Project Selection


<R05>
Sec. 84.30  How are projects selected for grants?

    Project selection is a three-step process: proposal acceptance, 
proposal ranking, and proposal selection.
    (a) Proposal acceptance. (1) The Regional Federal Aid Offices decide 
whether a proposal should be accepted for consideration by determining 
if the proposal is complete, substantial, and contains activities that 
are eligible. Proposals that do not qualify are immediately returned to 
the State. Revision and resubmission of returned proposals is allowable 
during this period, which is in June (check with your Regional Office 
for the exact dates each year). If any of the factors of completeness, 
substantiality, or eligibility are not met, the Regions should not 
forward the proposal to the Washington Office.
    (2) To be considered for acceptance, the proposal must be 
substantial in character and design. A substantial proposal is one that:
    (i) Identifies and describes a need within the purposes of the Act;
    (ii) Identifies the objective to be accomplished based on the stated 
need;
    (iii) Uses accepted principles, sound design, and appropriate 
procedures;
    (iv) Provides public conservation benefits that are cost effective 
and long-term, i.e., at least 20 years; and
    (v) Identifies obtainable, quantified performance measures (acres 
enhanced, restored, or protected) that help achieve the management goals 
and objectives of the National Coastal Wetlands Conservation Grant 
Program. Through this program, the States' efforts and leadership will 
help the Service meet its Long-Term and Annual Performance Goals as 
expressed in the Service's Annual Performance Plan.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The Service's Annual Performance Plan can be found on the 
Service's homepage at http://www//.fws.gov/r9gpra. For more information 
you might also contact the Budget Office at 202-208-4596 or the Planning 
and Evaluation Staff at 202-208-2549.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) The grant limit is $1 million. Proposals requesting Program 
awards that exceed $1 million will be returned to the appropriate State. 
Similarly, individual projects that have clearly been divided into 
multiple proposals for submission in one grant cycle to avoid this limit 
will be returned to the appropriate State. The State can revise and 
resubmit the proposal so that the request does not exceed the $1 million 
limit.
    (b) Proposal ranking. Once a proposal is accepted by the Region, the 
Regional Federal Aid Office sends the proposal to the National Federal 
Aid Office, which works with the National Office of the Fish and 
Wildlife Management and Habitat Restoration Program for distribution to 
a Review Panel. The Review Panel includes representation from our 
coastal Regions and from other Service Programs, for example, the 
Endangered Species Program. The Fisheries and Habitat Conservation 
Program is responsible for coordinating the review and ranking of 
proposals according to the established criteria, a process that usually 
involves a national meeting.
    (c) Proposal selection. The Review Panel's recommendations are 
forwarded to the Director of the Service for a final review and project 
selection. The Director announces the selection by October 1.


<R05>
Sec. 84.31  An overview of the ranking criteria.

    (a) The primary objective of the proposal will be to acquire, 
restore, enhance, or manage coastal wetlands to

[[Page 534]]

benefit coastal wetlands and the hydrology, water quality, and fish and 
wildlife dependent upon them. The Program will not provide grants, for 
example, for construction or repair of boat ramps or docks for 
recreational purposes and construction or support of research facilities 
or activities. The purpose of the ranking criteria is to provide a means 
for selecting the best projects--those that produce the maximum benefits 
to coastal wetlands and the fish and wildlife that depend on them.
    (b) Proposal ranking factors--(1) Ranking criteria. As explained in 
Sec. 84.32, we will evaluate proposals according to 13 ranking 
criteria. These criteria have varying point values. Proposals must 
address each of these 13 criteria.
    (2) Additional considerations. Even though the criteria provide the 
primary evaluation of proposals, we may factor additional considerations 
into the ranking decision at the national level. In case of a tie, we 
will use these additional considerations to rank proposals having 
identical scores.
    (c) The criteria in Sec. 84.32 are not listed in priority order.
    (d) Points are assigned on the basis of a completed project, rather 
than current conditions, e.g., count 50 acres of estuarine emergent 
wetlands if 50 acres of that habitat type will be restored when the 
project is completed.
    (e) A range of points rather than a set point value allows the 
reviewer to distinguish between, for example, a proposal that provides 
some foraging habitat for a threatened species versus one that provides 
critical nesting habitat of several endangered species. Scoring guidance 
is included with the individual criteria.
    (f) A total of 64 points is possible under the scoring system.
    (g) If a grant proposal is not selected, the State may resubmit it 
for reconsideration in subsequent fiscal years. Resubmission of a grant 
proposal is the responsibility of the applicant.


<R05>
Sec. 84.32  What are the ranking criteria?

    (a) The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will rank proposals using the 
13 criteria listed below. In the following list, a description of each 
criterion is followed by examples and the points they would receive for 
that criterion.
    (1) Wetlands conservation. Will the project reverse coastal wetland 
loss or habitat degradation in decreasing or stable coastal wetland 
types? Will it conserve wetlands to prevent losses of decreasing or 
stable wetland types? (Maximum: 7 points)
    (i) The majority of the project area (over 50 percent) is nationally 
decreasing coastal wetland types,\2\ or the majority is regionally 
decreasing wetlands types in which the case for regionally decreasing is 
well-documented (Up to 7 points). The nationally decreasing types are 
estuarine intertidal emergent; estuarine intertidal forested; estuarine 
intertidal scrub-shrub; marine intertidal; palustrine emergent; 
palustrine forested; and palustrine scrub-shrub. Describe the wetlands 
using terms listed above. Include a breakdown showing the percentage of 
the proposal's total and wetland acreage in decreasing types. Provide 
National Wetlands Inventory codes/information if available. Information 
about these can be found on the National Wetland Inventory's web site at 
http://wetlands.fws.gov.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ These designations are based on the National Wetlands Priority 
Conservation Plan. For more information about the plan, or to receive a 
copy of the document, refer to the contact information provided in Sec. 
84.21.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) The majority of the project area (over 50 percent) is 
nationally stable coastal wetlands types \2\ (Up to 5 points). The 
nationally stable types are estuarine intertidal non-vegetated and 
estuarine subtidal. Describe the wetlands using the terms listed above. 
Include a breakdown showing the percentage of the proposal's total and 
wetland acreage in stable types. Provide National Wetlands Inventory 
codes/information if available.
    (iii) Wetlands benefited are less than 50 percent of the project 
area. (Up to 3 points)
    (iv) If the project would benefit wetlands in the upper portion of 
the coastal watershed, but does not demonstrate significant and direct 
benefits to coastal wetlands, the proposal will not receive any points. 
(0 points)
    (v) We will award a full 7 points to proposals that document that 
over 50

[[Page 535]]

percent of their project area would be, upon project completion, 
decreasing coastal wetland types. A combination of decreasing and stable 
types that is over 50 percent of the project area could receive an 
intermediate score of 4, 5, or 6 points, depending on the balance 
between decreasing and stable types. If wetlands are 50 percent or less 
of the project area, use the following guide for allocating points: 25 
to 50 percent of the project area is decreasing or stable wetlands, 2, 
3, or 4 points; 5 to 24 percent, 1 or 2 points; and less than 5 percent, 
0 points.
    (2) Maritime forests on coastal barriers. Will the proposal 
significantly benefit maritime forests on coastal barriers? The coastal 
barrier does not need to be a unit of the Coastal Barrier Resources 
System. (Maximum: 7 points)
    (i) The proposal documents significant benefit to maritime forests 
on a coastal barrier. Describe the forest in sufficient detail so 
reviewers can determine whether it meets the definition of ``maritime 
forest.'' (Up to 7 points)
    (ii) The proposal does not benefit maritime forests on a coastal 
barrier. (0 points)
    (iii) For this criterion most scores should be either 0 or 7. If 
questions arise about the significance of the benefit or whether the 
forests meet the strict definition, an intermediate score could be 
given.
    (3) Long-term conservation. Does the project ensure long-term 
conservation of coastal wetland functions? The project must provide at 
least 20 years of conservation benefits to be eligible. (Maximum: 7 
points)
    (i) Once the project is complete, the project will provide 
continuing coastal wetlands benefits in perpetuity (100 years or 
longer). (7 points)
    (ii) Once the project is complete, the project will provide 
continuing coastal wetland benefits for 50-99 years. (3 to 6 points)
    (iii) Once the project is complete, the proposal will provide 
continuing coastal wetlands benefits for 20-49 years. (1 to 3 points)
    (iv) The proposal should show how the project will be maintained and 
the benefits sustained over time. Proposals must include adequate 
documentation of long-term conservation of coastal wetland values, such 
as a 25-year easement, to receive points for this criterion. If part of 
the project's benefits will be perpetual (owned in fee title, for 
example) and part is estimated to last 20 years, reviewers should weigh 
the different elements of the project and give an intermediate score.
    (4) Coastal watershed management. Would the completed project help 
accomplish the natural resource goals and objectives of one or more 
formal, ongoing coastal ecosystem or coastal watershed management 
plan(s) or effort(s)? Describe the management plan or effort(s). 
(Maximum: 3 points)
    (i) The project supports the natural resource goals of identified 
formal, ongoing coastal ecosystem or coastal watershed management plans 
or efforts. Describe the management plan(s) and/or effort(s) and explain 
how this project relates to its objectives. A plan that very 
specifically identifies the site will receive more points than a plan 
containing many generic references. (Up to 3 points)
    (ii) The project does not support the natural resource goals and 
objectives of a formal, ongoing coastal ecosystem or coastal watershed 
management effort. If the proposal benefits the upper portions of 
coastal watersheds, but provides no significant and direct benefits to 
the coastal wetlands ecosystems, the proposal will not receive points. 
(0 points)
    (5) Conservation of threatened and endangered species. Will the 
project benefit any federally listed endangered or threatened species, 
species proposed for Federal listing, recently delisted species, or 
designated or proposed critical habitat in coastal wetlands? Will it 
benefit State-listed threatened and endangered species? (Maximum: 5 
points)
    (i) The project will provide, restore, or enhance important habitat 
(e.g., nesting, breeding, feeding, nursery areas) for federally listed 
or proposed endangered or threatened species that use the coastal area 
project site for at least part of their life cycle. The project will 
benefit recently delisted species and habitat conservation plans 
developed under the auspices of the Endangered Species Act. List the 
species and their status (e.g., threatened or endangered) and provide 
documentation

[[Page 536]]

(e.g., cite recovery plan, attach letter from species expert) of current 
or recent species occurrence in the coastal area project site. Describe 
the importance of the habitat. (Up to 5 points)
    (ii) The project will provide, restore, or enhance important habitat 
for State-listed threatened and endangered species. (Up to 2 points)
    (iii) The project will not provide, restore, or enhance important 
habitat for federally or State-listed or proposed endangered or 
threatened species in the coastal area project site for any part of 
their life cycle. If the proposal provides benefits to threatened and 
endangered species in the upper portion of the coastal watershed, but 
provides no significant and direct benefits to threatened and endangered 
species using coastal wetlands ecosystem habitat, the proposal will not 
receive any points. (0 points)
    (iv) The combined scores of subparagraphs (a)(5)(i) and (a)(5)(ii) 
of this section cannot exceed the 5-point maximum.
    (6) Benefits to fish. Will the project provide, restore, or enhance 
important fisheries habitat? (Maximum: 5 points)
    (i) The project will provide, restore, or enhance important habitat 
(i.e., spawning, nursery, juvenile, or foraging habitat) for specific 
species that use the coastal area project site for at least part of 
their life cycle. These species may include anadromous, 
interjurisdictional, or other important species. List species, habitat 
types, and benefits to each species. (Up to 5 points)
    (ii) The project does not document current or future benefits to 
fish species and their habitat. (0 points)
    (iii) The more specific the information is on the use of the area 
and the importance of the habitat, the greater the points. An area 
specifically identified as critical for conservation in a fisheries 
management plan will, for example, receive more points than one which is 
not.
    (7) Benefits to coastal-dependent or migratory birds. Will the 
project provide, restore, or enhance important habitat for coastal-
dependent or migratory birds?
    (i) The project will provide, restore, or enhance important habitat 
(i.e., breeding, staging, foraging, wintering/summering habitat) 
benefits for at least part of the life cycle of coastal dependent or 
migratory birds. List the species and habitat types, and describe the 
benefits to each. (Up to 5 points)
    (ii) The project will not significantly benefit coastal-dependent or 
migratory birds. (0 points)
    (iii) We will give maximum points to projects that benefit coastal-
dependent species identified in the North American Waterfowl Plan or 
listed as species of management concern.\3\ Proposals should also 
include information that demonstrates how the project will contribute to 
the regional goals developed under the U.S. Shorebird Conservation Plan, 
the North American Waterbird Conservation Plan, Partners in Flight, the 
North American Waterfowl Management Plan, or other bird conservation 
initiatives. Proposals that fail to do so will not receive maximum 
points. Indicate if the proposed area has been specifically identified 
by any program or agency for its migratory bird values.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ For more information about species of management concern, visit 
the website migratorybirds.fws.gov or contact the Division of Migratory 
Bird Management at 703-358-1714.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (8) Prevent or reduce contamination. Will the project prevent or 
reduce input of contaminants to the coastal wetlands and associated 
coastal waters, or restore coastal wetlands and other associated coastal 
waters that are already contaminated? (Maximum: 5 points)
    (i) The project will prevent significant inputs of contaminants or 
will provide significant improvements to the quality of the coastal 
wetland and associated waters through protection from contaminants or 
restoration, including assimilation of nutrients and nonpersistent toxic 
substances. Describe the types and sources of possible or current 
impairment to the coastal wetland and other associated coastal waters 
(e.g., to water quality, sediments, flora, or fauna). Describe how 
contaminant inputs or residues will be prevented, reduced, or 
eliminated. Preventing contaminants by precluding residential 
development through acquisition will not normally warrant full

[[Page 537]]

points unless the applicant can be shown that significant contamination 
would have occurred otherwise. (Up to 5 points)
    (ii) The proposal will not significantly prevent impairment or 
improve the quality of the coastal wetland and associated coastal 
waters. If the proposal provides positive water quality benefits in the 
upper portions of watersheds, but provides no significant and direct 
positive water quality benefits to coastal wetland ecosystems, the 
proposal will not receive points. (0 points)
    (iii) Show direct links between contamination and wildlife and 
aquatic habitats. To receive full points, you should provide 
documentation of the linkage. Reviewers may consider the extent of 
contaminants prevention/reduction when assigning points. Proposals 
having the potential to produce an attractive nuisance (e.g., acquiring 
and/or restoring a wetland that will be attractive to wildlife and that 
also has the potential to accumulate high levels of persistent toxic 
metals or hydrocarbon compounds) will not receive points.
    (9) Catalyst for future conservation. Is the project proposal 
designed to leverage other ongoing coastal wetlands protection projects 
in the area, such as acquisition of areas to add to already acquired 
coastal lands, or provide impetus for additional restoration? (Maximum: 
4 points)
    (i) The project will be essential (e.g., key to completion or 
implementation of a greater conservation plan) to further advance or 
promote other coastal projects under way. Explain why. (Up to 4 points)
    (ii) The project proposal does not demonstrate a positive impact on 
other coastal projects. (0 points)
    (iii) To receive the maximum number of points, the proposal should 
be essential to the initiation or completion of a larger project. 
Examples may include acquisition of key in-holdings within a larger 
protected area, funds necessary to acquire fee simple interest in 
properties where a conservation easement has already been secured, and 
funds necessary to complete restoration activities to a protected area.
    (10) Partners in conservation. Will the proposal receive financial 
support, including in-kind match, from private, local, or other Federal 
interests? (Maximum: 4 points)
    (i) The proposal includes the State applicant plus one or more non-
State financial partners. (Up to 4 points)
    (ii) The proposal includes only financial support from the State 
applicant. (0 points)
    (iii) A written description of commitment of funds or in-kind match 
from the partners must accompany the proposal. (This requirement is in 
addition to signing the Assurances Form.) The purpose of this criterion 
is to promote partnerships with private, local, or other Federal 
agencies rather than to increase the dollar amount of the matching 
share. Therefore, no specific minimum amount is indicated here. At least 
two partners, in addition to the State applicant, should have committed 
money to the project to receive maximum points.
    (11) Federal share reduced. Does the proposal significantly reduce 
the Federal share by providing more than the required match amount? In 
the case of a Territory or Commonwealth that does not require match 
funds, does the proposal include financial support from sources other 
than the Territory or Commonwealth? (Maximum: 5 points)
    (i) The State, territory, or commonwealth applicant must have a non-
Federal funding source (in-kind match does not count for this criterion) 
that reduces the Federal share. (Up to 5 points)
    (ii) The maximum Federal share is requested by the proposal. (0 
points)
    (iii) The purpose of this criterion is to increase the amount of 
money from non-Federal sources. This increase decreases the need for 
Federal match dollars, so that Federal dollars can help more projects. 
Documentation of each partner's financial commitment must accompany the 
proposal to receive points. If the State itself provides the excess 
match, the State should receive credit for reducing the Federal share. 
Each 5 percent above the required State match would be approximately 
equal to 1 point. The following two examples, using both a 50 and 75 
percent Federal match share, define a 10 percent increase in a State's 
match amount.


[[Page 538]]


    (A) Example 1-50--Percent Federal Match

If the total project costs are $100,000, then the required State match 
    share is $50,000.
If the State or a partner provides an additional cash contribution equal 
    to 10 percent of the $50,000, $5,000. This is defined as a 10 
    percent increase in the State match.\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ From sources other than Federal agencies. Natural Resource 
Damage Assessment funds may in some cases be defined as ``non-Federal.'' 
See discussion under Sec. 84.46 on What are the cost-sharing 
requirements?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    (B) Example 2-75--Percent Federal Match

If the total project costs are $100,000, then the required State match 
    share is $25,000.
If the State or a partner provides an additional cash contribution equal 
    to 10 percent of the $25,000, $2,500. This is defined as a 10 
    percent increase in the State match.\4\

    (12) Education/outreach program or wildlife-oriented recreation. Is 
the project designed to increase environmental awareness and develop 
support for coastal wetlands conservation? Does it provide recreational 
opportunities that are consistent with the conservation goals of the 
site? (Maximum: 3 points)
    (i) The proposal includes a site-specific, substantive education/
outreach or wildlife-oriented recreation program. (Up to 3 points)
    (ii) The proposal does not include a substantive education/outreach 
or wildlife-oriented recreation program. (0 points)
    (iii) The proposal must describe what makes this program substantive 
and link it closely with the specific site to receive full points. 
Programs supported by activities or funds from partners should be 
encouraged over use of project dollars. Project proposals may include 
substantive education/outreach components necessary for the completion 
of the project. However, these should be activities that complement or 
support the primary goal of the project.
    (13) Other factors. Do any other factors, not covered in the 
previous criteria, make this project or site particularly unique and 
valuable? Does the project offer important benefits that are not 
reflected in the other criteria? The following list includes examples of 
projects that provide benefits not reflected in other criteria. 
(Maximum: 4 points)
    (i) The project might provide significant benefits to, for example: 
rare or threatened habitat types; biodiverse habitats; rare and 
declining species; and the local community.
    (ii) The project would be particularly cost-effective, providing 
very significant resource benefits for the cost.
    (iii) The project would assist in the prevention or control of 
invasive species.
    (iv) The project would provide important cultural or historical 
resource benefits.
    (v) The project would provide other benefits.
    (vi) Reviewers should not assign points to resource values covered 
by other criteria. The proposal should provide a short narrative to 
support claims to Other Factors points.
    (b) Additional considerations. We will factor the following 
considerations into the ranking process if two or more proposals have 
the same point totals. The tie-breaking factors are as follows:
    (1) The project would prevent the destruction or degradation of 
habitat from pending sale of property, from adverse effects of current 
activities such as draining of wetlands, or from natural processes such 
as erosion at excessive rates;
    (2) The project would protect unique and significant biological 
diversity;
    (3) The project has lower costs per acre conserved; and
    (4) In the project proposal the State or third party provides lands 
as opposed to using lands already owned by the State or third party as 
part of the State matching share.
    (c) All proposals must include the information described in 
paragraphs (b) (1)-(4) of this section. If a tie occurs between two or 
more proposals, the reviewers need to have this information available 
immediately to decide which proposal or proposals should be recommended 
for selection.

<R04>
         Subpart D_Conditions on Acceptance/Use of Federal Money


<R05>
Sec. 84.40  What conditions must I follow to accept Federal grant money?

    (a) The audit requirements for State and local governments (43 CFR 
part 12), and
    (b) The uniform administrative requirements for grants and 
cooperative agreements with State and local governments (43 CFR part 
12).


<R05>
Sec. 84.41  Who prepares a grant agreement? What needs to be included?

    The coastal State and the Fish and Wildlife Service work together to 
develop a Grant Agreement (Form 3-1552) upon completion of the review by 
the Regional Director to determine compliance with applicable Federal 
laws and regulations. The Grant Agreement includes the grant title, the 
grant cost distribution, the agreement period, other grant provisions, 
and special grant conditions. If a Coastal Barrier Unit is affected, the 
Service must conduct internal consultations pursuant to Section 6 of the 
Coastal Barrier Resources Act, as amended by the Coastal Barrier 
Improvement Act, prior to providing any grant monies to that State.


<R05>
Sec. 84.42  What if a grant agreement is not signed?

    Monies that have been allocated for a grant will be held until 
December 31 of the following year. If a grant agreement has not been 
signed by the State and the Service and, therefore, the money has not 
been obligated for the approved grant by that date, the funds 
automatically are returned to the Program account in Washington.


<R05>
Sec. 84.43  How do States get the grant monies?

    Funding to States is provided on a reimbursable basis. See Sec. 
84.47 for information on what costs can be reimbursed. The Service may 
reimburse the State for projects completed, or make payments as the 
project progresses. For construction work and labor, the Service and the 
State may jointly determine, on a case-by-case basis, that payments may 
be made in advance. We will minimize the time elapsing between the 
transfer to the State and the State's need for the funds, and the time 
period will be subject to a specific determined need for the funds in 
advance. Except for extenuating circumstances, a reasonable time period 
to advance funds to a State is up to 3 days. OMB Circular A-102, Parts 
II and III, 43 CFR part 12, and 31 CFR part 205 provide specific 
information on methods and procedures for transferring funds.


<R05>
Sec. 84.44  What is the timetable for the use of grant money?

    Once money is granted to the coastal States, the money is available 
to those States for the time designated in the grant agreement. If a 
State needs more time, the State must apply for an extension of time by 
amending the grant agreement. If the Service does not extend the time, 
the unobligated monies return to the Service for expenditure on future 
grants. Also, if a State cannot spend the money on the approved project, 
the State must notify the appropriate Regional Director as soon as 
possible so that the money can revert back to the Service for future 
grants.


<R05>
Sec. 84.45  How do I amend a proposal?

    Following procedures in 43 CFR 12.70, you must submit a signed 
original and two copies of the revised SF 424, the revised portion of 
the project statement if appropriate, and an explanation of the reason 
for the revision to the Regional Director (Federal Aid).


<R05>
Sec. 84.46  What are the cost-sharing requirements?

    (a) Except for certain insular areas, the Federal share of an 
approved grant will not exceed 50 percent of approved costs incurred. 
However, the Federal share may be increased to 75 percent for coastal 
States that have established and are using a fund as defined in Sec. 
84.11. The Regions must certify the eligibility of the fund in order for 
the State to qualify for the 75 percent matching share.
    (b) The following insular areas: American Samoa, Guam, the 
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin 
Islands, have been exempted from the matching share, as provided in Pub. 
L. 95-134, amended by Pub. L. 95-348, Pub. L. 96-

[[Page 540]]

205, Pub. L. 98-213, and Pub. L. 98-454 (48 U.S.C. 1469a). Puerto Rico 
is not exempt from the match requirements of this Program.
    (c) The State may provide materials (e.g., heavy equipment) or other 
services as a noncash match for portions of the State's matching share. 
The State may also provide the value of land, including the land 
proposed for restoration, enhancement, or management as a noncash match, 
provided that the land is necessary and reasonable for completing the 
project. For example, if a State proposes to manage a contiguous wetland 
of 100 acres, and already owns 10 of the 100 acres, the State can apply 
the current value of the 10 acres, provided that the 10 acres are 
necessary to manage the entire 100 acres. If the 10-acre wetland were 
not contiguous and no connection could be made that the 10 acres were 
needed to manage the proposed wetland, the State could not use the 10 
acres as a noncash match. Review 43 CFR 12.64 for determining the value 
of in-kind contributions.
    (d) The requirements in 43 CFR 12.64 and Service Manual Part 522 FW 
1.13 \5\ apply to in-kind matches or cost-sharing involving third 
parties. Third party in-kind contributions must represent the current 
market value of noncash contributions furnished as part of the grant by 
another public agency, private organization, or individual. In-kind 
matches must be necessary and reasonable to accomplish grant objectives.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ From the Fish and Wildlife Service Manual, available on-line at 
http://www.fws.gov/directives/index.html.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (e) Coastal States must commit to their matching share of the total 
costs by signing the Application for Federal Assistance (SF 424), the 
Assurances (SF 424B or SF 424D), and the Grant Agreement (Form 3-1552).
    (f) No Federal monies, non-Federal monies, in-kind contributions, or 
National Fish and Wildlife Foundation grant program monies that will be 
or have been previously used to satisfy the matching requirement of 
another Federal grant can be used as part of the coastal State's 
matching share.
    (g) The coastal State is responsible for ensuring the full amount of 
that State's matching requirement, either with State funds or from 
contributions toward the proposal from other agencies, groups, or 
individuals. Sources other than State applicant funds must be documented 
and approved as eligible.
    (h) Total Federal contributions (including all Federal sources 
outside of the Program) may not exceed the maximum eligible Federal 
share under the Program. This includes monies provided to the State by 
other Federal programs. If the amount of Federal money available to the 
project is more than the maximum allowed, we will reduce the Program 
contribution by the amount in excess.
    (i) Natural Resource Damage Assessment funds that are managed by a 
non-Federal trustee are considered to be non-Federal, even if these 
monies were once deposited in the Department of the Interior's Natural 
Resource Damage Assessment and Restoration Fund, provided the following 
criteria are met:
    (1) The monies were deposited pursuant to a joint and indivisible 
recovery by the Department of the Interior and non-Federal trustees 
under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and 
Liability Act (CERCLA) or the Oil Pollution Act (OPA);
    (2) The non-Federal trustee has joint and binding control over the 
funds;
    (3) The co-trustees agree that monies from the fund should be 
available to the non-Federal trustee and can be used as a non-Federal 
match to support a project consistent with the settlement agreement, 
CERCLA, and OPA; and
    (4) The monies have been transferred to the non-Federal trustee.


<R05>
Sec. 84.47  What are allowable costs?

    (a) Allowable grant costs are limited to costs necessary and 
reasonable to achieve approved grant objectives and meet the applicable 
Federal cost principles in 43 CFR 12.62 (b).
    (b) If a project or facility is designed to include purposes other 
than those eligible under the Act, the costs must be prorated among the 
various purposes.

[[Page 541]]

    (c) If you incur costs before the effective date of the grant, they 
cannot be reimbursed, with the exception that we can allow preliminary 
costs, but only with the approval of the appropriate Regional Director. 
Preliminary costs may include costs necessary for preparing the grant 
proposal, such as feasibility surveys, engineering design, biological 
reconnaissance, appraisals, or preparation of grant documents such as 
environmental assessments for compliance with the National Environmental 
Policy Act.


<R05>
Sec. 84.48  What are the procedures for acquiring, maintaining, and 

disposing of real property?

    (a) Acquisition, maintenance, and disposal of real property must 
follow the rules established in 43 CFR 12.71 and 50 CFR 80.14.
    (1) Title to real property acquired under a grant or subgrant must 
be vested in the State or subgrantee, including local governments and 
nonprofit organizations. States must submit documentation (e.g., 
appraisals and appraisal reviews) to the Regional Director who must 
approve it before the State becomes legally obligated for the purchase. 
States will provide title vesting evidence and summary of land costs 
upon completion of the acquisition. The grant agreement and any deed to 
third parties (e.g., conservation easement or other lien on a third-
party property) must include appropriate language to ensure that the 
lands and/or interests would revert back to the State or Federal 
Government if the conditions of the grant were no longer being 
implemented.
    (2) In cases where the interest obtained is less than fee simple 
title, the interest must be sufficient for long-term conservation of the 
specified wetlands resources.
    (3) Real property acquired with National Coastal Wetlands 
Conservation Grant funds must continue to serve the purpose for which it 
was acquired. If acquired property is used for reasons inconsistent with 
the purpose(s) for which acquired, such activities must cease and any 
adverse effects on the property must be corrected by the State or 
subgrantee with non-Federal monies in accordance with 50 CFR 80.14.
    (4) The State or subgrantee may not dispose of or encumber its title 
or other interest in real property without prior approval of the 
appropriate Regional Director of the Service. Real property includes, 
but is not limited to, lands, buildings, minerals, energy resources, 
timber, grazing, and animal products. If real property is sold, the 
State or subgrantee must compensate the Service in accordance with 43 
CFR 12.71(c)(2).
    (5) If rights or interests obtained with the acquisition of coastal 
wetlands generate revenue during the Grant Agreement period, the State 
will treat the revenue as program income and use it to manage the 
acquired properties. If the State sells or leases real property, the 
State must treat the proceeds as program income and return the money to 
the Federal Aid program regardless of the grant period.
    (6) Inconsistent use that is not corrected can be grounds for 
denying a State future grants under this Program.
    (b) A coastal State is responsible for design, supervision, and 
inspection of all major construction projects in accordance with 
accepted engineering standards.
    (1) The coastal State must have adequate rights to lands or waters 
where restoration or enhancement projects are planned to ensure 
protection and use of the facilities or structures throughout their 
useful life.
    (2) The construction, enlargement, or rehabilitation of dams are 
subject to Federal standards for dam design. If requested, the State 
must provide to the Regional Office written certification that any 
proposed changes to a dam meet Federal standards.
    (3) The coastal State must operate and maintain facilities, 
structures, or related assets to ensure their use for the stated project 
purpose and that they are adequately protected.
    (c) Acquisition, property records, maintenance, and disposal of 
equipment must be made in accordance with 43 CFR 12.72.

<R05>
Sec. 84.49  What if the project costs more or less than originally 

expected?

    All requests for additional monies for approved coastal wetland 
grants will be subject to the entire review process along with new 
grants. Any monies left over after the project is complete, or if the 
project is not completed, should be returned to the Washington Office 
for use in following years. If a State has lands it wishes to acquire, 
restore, or enhance in close proximity to the original project, and the 
Region deems that spending project monies in these areas would provide 
similar benefits, the Region may use unspent balances to pay for these 
projects with prior approval from the Washington Office. States must 
provide adequate justification and documentation to the Regions that the 
lands acquired, restored, or enhanced are similar to those in the 
original proposal and provide similar benefits to fish and wildlife.


<R05>
Sec. 84.50  How does a State certify compliance with Federal laws, 

regulations, and policies?

    (a) In accepting Federal money, coastal State representatives must 
agree to and certify compliance with all applicable Federal laws, 
regulations, and policies. The applicant will need to submit a Statement 
of Assurances (either SF 424B or SF 424D) signed and dated by an 
authorized agency representative as part of the proposal.
    (b) Compliance with environmental and other laws, as defined in the 
Service Manual 523 FW Chapter 1,\6\ may require additional 
documentation. Consult with Regional Offices for how this applies to a 
specific project.

                            Subpart A_General


<R05>
Sec. 85.10  Purpose and scope.

    The purpose of this part is to establish requirements for state 
participation in the Clean Vessel Act Grant Program authorized by 
Section 5604 of the Clean Vessel Act (Public Law 102-587, Subtitle F).


<R05>
Sec. 85.11  Definitions.

    Terms used in this part shall have the following meaning:
    Clean Vessel Act or Act. The Clean Vessel Act (Pub. L. 102-587, 
subtitle F).
    Coastal State. A State of the United States in, or bordering on, the 
Atlantic, Pacific, or Arctic Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico, Long Island 
Sound, or one or more of the Great Lakes. The term also includes Puerto 
Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern 
Mariana Islands. The term excludes Alaska and American Samoa because 
these States have a ratio of the number of recreational vessels in the 
State numbered under chapter 123 of title 46, United States Code, to 
number of miles of shoreline (as that term is defined in Sec. 926.2(d) 
of title 15, Code of Federal Regulations, as in effect on January 1, 
1991), of less than one.

[[Page 543]]

    Costal waters. In the Great Lakes area, the waters within the 
territorial jurisdiction of the United States consisting of the Great 
lakes, their connecting waters, harbors, roadsteads, and estuary-type 
areas such as bays, shallows, and marshes. In other areas, those waters, 
adjacent to the shorelines, which contain a measurable percentage of sea 
water, including sounds, bays, lagoons, bayous, ponds, and estuaries.
    Coastal zone. Coastal zone has the same meaning that the term has in 
section 304(1) of the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1992 (16 U.S.C. 
1453(1)). The coastal zone consists of coastal waters (including the 
lands therein and thereunder) and the adjacent shorelands, including 
islands, transitional and intertidal areas, salt marshes, wetlands, and 
beaches. The zone extends, in Great Lakes waters, to the international 
boundary between the United States and Canada and, in other areas, 
seaward to the outer limit of the United States territorial sea. The 
zone extends inland from the shorelines only to the extent necessary to 
control shorelands and protect coastal waters.
    Construction. Activities which produce new capital improvements and 
increase the value of usefulness of existing property.
    Dump station. A facility specifically designed to receive sewage 
from portable toilets carried on vessels. Dump stations do not include 
lavatories or restrooms.
    Education/information. The education/information program, as

    Equitable fees. The maximum charge per pumpout is $5.00. Price 
modifications and discounts are subject to State/Federal laws concerning 
pricing.
    Facility. A pumpout station or dump station.
    Facility open to the public. (1) A Clean Vessel Act facility that is 
open and available to the public is one where the public has full and 
reasonable access to the pumpout/dump station, including:
    (i) Provision of signage visible from the water to direct boaters to 
pumpout/dump stations;
    (ii) Location of pumpouts to facilitate ease of use by all boats 
typical to that particular marina;
    (iii) Equitable fees; and
    (iv) Reasonable open periods.
    (2) To be eligible for funding under this program, both public and 
private facilities must be open to the public.
    Grant. An award of financial assistance, including cooperative 
agreements, in the form of money, or property in lieu of money, by the 
Federal Government to an eligible grantee.
    Inland State. A State which is not a coastal State. The District of 
Columbia, American Samoa and Alaska are included as inland States 
(Rationale for Samoa and Alaska being inland States can be found in 
Sec. 85.11(b) above).
    Maintenance. Those activities necessary for upkeep of a facility. 
These are activities that allow the facility to function and include 
routine recurring custodial maintenance such as housekeeping and minor 
repairs as well as the supplies, materials, and tools necessary to carry 
out the work. Also included is non-routine cyclical maintenance to keep 
facilities fully functional.
    Operation. Those activities necessary for the functioning of a 
facility to produce desired results. These are activities that make the 
facility work.
    Plans. Those plans identified in the technical guidelines as 
published in the Federal Register, for construction or renovation of 
pumpout and dump stations necessary to ensure that there are adequate 
and reasonably available stations to meet the needs of recreational 
vessels using the coastal waters of the State.
    Private facilities. Private facilities include those operated by the 
following:
    (1) For profit or non-profit private marinas, docks, etc.;
    (2) For profit or non-profit concessionaires, whether they are 
leased or private facilities, on public lands; or
    (3) Yacht or boating clubs, whether they are open to the public or 
members-only facilities.

[[Page 544]]

    Public facilities. Public facilities include municipal, county, port 
authority, State and Federal marinas, docks, etc., operated by those 
agencies.
    Pumpout station. A facility that pumps or receives sewage from a 
type III marine sanitation device (holding tank) installed on board 
vessels.
    Reasonable open periods. This part does not specify hours, days and 
seasons, however, some suggested examples, provided no other factors are 
involved, are presented:
    (1) Pumpout/dump stations may be open during the same period the 
fuel docks are normally open.
    (2) Pumpout stations may be open when the marina is open and staff 
is present to pump out boats.
    (3) Pumpout/dump stations may be open during the hours considered to 
be normal marina business hours as adjusted by seasonal differences.
    Recreational vessel. Watercraft manufactured for operation, or 
operated, primarily for pleasure. This term includes any watercraft 
leased, rented, or chartered to another for the latter's pleasure.
    Renovation. Major rehabilitation of a facility to restore it to its 
original intended purpose.
    Surveys. Those surveys identified in the technical guidelines as 
published in the Federal Register. Surveys are designed to determine the 
number and location of all operational pumpout and dump stations at 
public and private marinas, mooring areas, docks, and other boating 
access facilities within the coastal zone. Surveys also are designed to 
determine the number of recreational vessels in coastal waters with 
holding tanks or portable toilets, and the areas of coastal waters where 
those vessels congregate.
    Type III marine sanitation device (holding tank). Any equipment for 
installation on board a vessel which is specifically designed to 
receive, retain, and discharge sewage.

             Subpart D_Conditions on Use/Acceptance of Funds


<R05>
Sec. 85.40  Cost sharing.

    (a) The Federal share shall not exceed 75% of total costs approved 
in the grant agreement.
    (b) The provisions of 43 CFR 12.64 apply to cost sharing or matching 
requirements. Third party in-kind contributions must be necessary and 
reasonable to accomplish grant objectives and represent the current 
market value of noncash contributions furnished as part of the grant by 
another public agency, private organization, or individual.


<R05>
Sec. 85.41  Allowable costs.

    (a) Allowable grant costs are limited to those costs that are 
necessary and reasonable for accomplishment of approved grant objectives 
and meet the applicable Federal cost principles in 43 CFR 12.60(b). 
Purchase of informational signs, program signs, and symbols designating 
pumpout and dump stations, are allowable costs.

[[Page 547]]

    (b) Grants or facilities designed to include purposes other than 
those eligible under the Act shall have the costs prorated equitably 
among the various purposes. Grant funds shall only be used for the part 
of the activity related to the Clean Vessel Act.
    (c) Costs incurred prior to the effective date of the grant 
agreement are not allowable with the exception that preliminary costs 
are allowed only with the approval of the appropriate Regional Director. 
Preliminary costs may include such items as feasibility surveys, 
engineering design, biological reconnaissance, appraisals, or 
preparation of grant documents such as environmental assessments for 
compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act.


<R05>
Sec. 85.42  Real and personal property.

    (a) Applicable regulations regarding acquisition, property records, 
maintenance, and disposal of real property and equipment are found in 43 
CFR 12.71 and 12.72. If questions arise regarding applicability, the

    (b) A State shall ensure that design and installation of the 
facilities are in accordance with the technical standards identified in 
the technical guidelines as published in the Federal Register.
    (c) The State must ensure that facilities are operated and 
maintained, and that structures or related assets are used for the 
stated grant purpose.


<R05>
Sec. 85.43  Signs and symbols.

    (a) Signs. Facilities must display appropriate information signs at 
pumpout and portable toilet dump stations. Such information should 
indicate fees, restrictions, hours of operation, operating instructions, 
a contact name and 1-800-ASK-FISH telephone number for boaters to get 
additional information or to report an inoperable facility.
    (b) Pumpout symbol. (1) At appropriate times, to increase public 
awareness of the Clean Vessel Act Pumpout Grant Program, use a pumpout 
symbol according to Service specifications. Use the pumpout symbol as 
follows:
    (i) As a sign at the entrance to a marina advertising the presence 
of a pumpout and/or portable toilet dump station;
    (ii) As a directional sign within a marina;
    (iii) As a sign at a pumpout and/or portable toilet dump station;
    (iv) As a symbol on educational and informational material; and
    (v) For other uses as appropriate to advance the purposes of the 
Clean Vessel Act.
    (2) To avoid confusion with having two symbols, use the selected 
symbol both for pumpout stations and portable dump stations. The Service 
encourages the use of this symbol as it is not copyrighted. The NOAA NOS 
magenta ``P'' within a magenta circle will continue to be used on 
nautical charts to identify the location of pumpout and portable toilet 
dump stations. NOAA will include information about the selected pumpout 
symbol in the U.S. Coast Pilots, a supplement to the charts, to relate 
this symbol to the NOAA Nautical Chart magenta ``P'' and circle.
    (3) All recipients identified in Sec. 85.11 should display the 
appropriate pumpout symbol on facilities, such as pumpout and portable 
toilet dump stations, or on printed material or other visual 
representations relating to project accomplishments or education/
information, and should encourage others to do so. Sub-recipients also 
should display the symbol and should encourage use by others for the 
purposes stated in this paragraph (b)(3).
    (4) The Service encourages other persons or organizations, such as 
marinas with pumpout stations not constructed with Clean Vessel Act 
funds, to use the symbol to advance the purposes of the Clean Vessel Act 
program.
    (5) The following specifications shall apply: The symbol is black, 
the background is white, and the border is international orange. There 
is no standard for the black and white, but use black and white colors, 
not shades. The standards for the international orange color is as 
follows: For day boards (signs), use retroflective international orange 
film. For paint, use international orange conforming to FED-STD 595B, 
chip number 12197 in daylight conditions. For inks, use Pantone Matching 
System color chart 179C. In order to ensure visibility after dark,

[[Page 548]]

use reflectorized film or paint, and/or artificial illumination. Pumpout 
symbol technical specifications to construct signs and for other 
purposes are available upon request.
    (6) The following rules govern the graphic reproduction of the 
symbol:
    (i) Do not use a smaller than legible symbol.
    (ii) If you reduce or enlarge the symbol, maintain the same 
proportions.
    (iii) Do not obscure the symbol by overprinting.
    (iv) Do not place the symbol where it will be split by unlike 
backgrounds.
    (v) Do not place the symbol on a background that is highly textured 
or patterned.
    (vi) When appropriate, for economical reasons, depict the symbol in 
one-color (black) with a white background, rather than two-color 
(international orange and black) with white background.
    (7) The pumpout symbol follows:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27AU97.010
    
    (c) Qualifying signs. (1) In conjunction with the symbol, you may 
use other qualifying signs below the symbol, either on the same sign or 
on a separate sign.
    (i) You may place the message ``P PUMP OUT'', ``P PUMPOUT STATION'', 
``P PORTABLE TOILET DUMP STATION'', or other appropriate qualifier, 
beneath the symbol. Place the magenta-colored ``P'' and circle in front 
of the message to relate the pumpout symbol to the NOAA NOS nautical 
charts. Messages may be appropriate for several years until the symbol 
is understood without the message. When appropriate, substitute a black 
``P'' and circle for economical reasons.
    (ii) You may place directional arrows beneath the symbol to indicate 
the direction of pumpout or portable toilet dump station facilities.
    (2) The following specifications shall apply: Symbols, such as 
directional arrows, and letters, are black, and the background is white. 
For using inks to create the magenta color, use PMS

[[Page 549]]

color chart 259U. Letters and black and white colors shall follow the 
Federal Highway Administration's Manual on Uniform Traffic Control 
Devices for Streets and Highways (MUTCD), FHWA, 1988. The Superintendent 
of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402, 
provides for sale copies of the 1988 MUTCD, including Revision No. 3, 
dated September 3, 1993, Stock No. 050-001-00308-2.
    (3) The same rules governing the graphic reproduction of the pumpout 
symbol, as described in paragraph (b)(6) of this section, shall apply to 
qualifying signs.
    (d) Pumpout slogan. (1) Use the pumpout slogan according to Service 
specifications to help increase boater awareness of the need to use 
pumpout and dump stations to properly dispose of their boat sewage. Use 
the slogan in conjunction with the pumpout symbol, on educational/
informational material, and for other uses as appropriate to advance the 
purposes of the Clean Vessel Act. The slogan is not copyrighted, and the 
Service encourages its appropriate use.
    (2) All recipients identified in Sec. 85.11 should display the 
pumpout slogan on facilities, such as pumpout and portable toilet dump 
stations as appropriate, and on printed material or other visual 
representations relating to project accomplishments or education/
information, and should encourage others to do so. Sub-recipients should 
display the slogan for purposes as stated above and should encourage 
others to do so.
    (3) The Service encourages other persons or organizations, such as 
marinas with pumpout stations not constructed with Clean Vessel Act 
funds, to use the slogan to advance the purposes of the Clean Vessel Act 
program.
    (4) The following specifications shall apply: Letters are black and 
background is white. The same reference under specifications for 
Qualifying Signs in paragraph (c)(2) of this section shall apply.
    (5) The same rules governing the graphic reproduction of the pumpout 
symbol, as described in paragraph (b)(6) of this section, shall apply to 
the pumpout slogan.
    (6) The pumpout slogan follows:


KEEP OUR WATER CLEAN--USE PUMPOUTS

    (e) All information signs, pumpout symbol, qualifying signs, and 
pumpout slogan identified in this section and the crediting logo 
identified in Sec. 85.47, inform and educate boaters. Therefore, use 
the signs, symbol, slogan and logo as appropriate. For instance, a sign 
on the water directing boaters to a pumpout may only need the pumpout 
symbol, and a qualifying sign beneath, e.g., an arrow, and possibly the 
words ``PUMPOUT STATION''. For pumpout and dump stations, the pumpout 
symbol, slogan, information signs, including all information in 
paragraph (a) of this section, and the crediting and State logo may be 
appropriate. If desirable, add qualifying signs. Position a legible 
sign, symbol and logo either on the pumpout/dump station, on a separate 
sign, or both, for the greatest effect in informing and educating 
boaters. For other products such as print and video public service 
announcements, brochures, etc., the placement of symbols, etc. depends 
on space availability. The following order of priority dictates the 
order of use under limited space conditions: the pumpout symbol, slogan, 
1-800-ASK-FISH telephone number and Sport Fish Restoration crediting 
logo. Add other information as appropriate. Use judgement when placing 
information on signs so as not to confuse the reader. Display the 
symbol, logo, slogan and information signs in the appropriate locations. 
To reduce wind drag when bolting signs on pilings, it was found helpful 
in the Northeast to make signs taller than wider. Symbol or logo size 
may vary. However, if you reduce or enlarge the symbol, maintain the 
same proportions.

<R05>
Sec. 86.30  Must I allow the public to use the grant-funded facilities?

    (a) You must allow reasonable access to all recreational vessels for 
the useful life of the tie-up facilities. Accessible to the public means 
located where

[[Page 556]]

the public can reasonably reach the facility and where all boats typical 
to that facility can easily use it, charging equitable fees, and being 
open for reasonable periods. You must allow public access to the shore 
and basic features such as fuel and restrooms in facilities that have 
them. You must specify precise details of the public access in the 
contract with the facility manager. We do not require public access to 
the remainder of a park or marina where the facility is found. Nor do we 
require any restrictions in that park or marina.
    (b) You must comply with Americans with Disabilities Act 
requirements when you construct or renovate all tie-up facilities under 
this grant.


<R05>
Sec. 86.31  How much money may I charge the public to use tie-up 

facilities?

    You may charge the public only a reasonable fee, based on the 
prevailing rate in the area. You must determine a fee that does not pose 
an unreasonable, competitive amount, based on other publicly and 
privately owned tie-up facilities in the area. You must approve any 
proposed changes in fee structure by a sub-grantee.


<R04>
                     Subpart D_Funding Availability


<R05>
Sec. 86.40  How much money is available for grants?

    There is $32 million available for grants under the BIG program ($8 
million per year for fiscal years 2000-2003).


<R05>
Sec. 86.41  How long will the money be available?

    Under the Act, funding for the BIG program is provided for FY 2000-
2003. Each year's funds remain available for obligation for a total of 
three fiscal years (e.g. FY 2000 funds will remain available through FY 
2002) (16 U.S.C. 777c(b)(3)(B)).


<R05>
Sec. 86.42  What are the match requirements?

    The Act authorizes the Secretary of the Interior (through the 
Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service)) to award 
grants to States to pay up to 75 percent of the cost to construct, 
renovate, or maintain tie-up facilities for transient nontrailerable 
recreational vessels. You or a partner must pay the remaining project 
cost--at least a 25 percent match is required. Title 43 CFR 12.64 
applies to cost sharing or matching requirements for Federal grants.


<R05>
Sec. 86.43  May someone else supply the match?

    Third-party contribution, including property and in-kind services, 
is allowable, but must be necessary and reasonable to accomplish grant 
objectives. In-kind contributions must also represent the current market 
value of noncash contributions that the third party furnishes as part of 
the grant.


<R05>
Sec. 86.44  What are my allowable costs?

    (a) The State may spend grant funds to pay only costs that are 
necessary and reasonable to accomplish the approved grant objectives. 
Grant costs must meet the applicable Federal cost principles in 43 CFR 
12.62. You may purchase informational and program signs as allowable 
costs.
    (b) If you include purposes other than those eligible under the Act, 
you must prorate the costs equitably according to Federal cost 
principles in 43 CFR 12.62 and 50 CFR 80.15.


<R05>
Sec. 86.45  When will I receive the funds?

    Once you sign the grant agreement, we will make the funds available.


<R04>
                  Subpart E_How States Apply for Grants


<R05>
Sec. 86.50  When must I apply?

    (a) We will accept proposals between February 20, 2001, and May 18, 
2001, for the first grant cycle; between July 1, 2001, and September 30, 
2001, for the second grant cycle; and between July 1, 2002, and 
September 30, 2002, for the third grant cycle. This program starts 
fiscal year 2000 and ends fiscal year 2003. We will have $16 million to 
award the first grant cycle, and $8 million each cycle after that.
    (b) The annual schedule follows:

<R05>
Sec. 86.52  What information must I include in my grant proposals?

    You must submit the following standard forms and narrative for all 
projects (Tier One and Tier Two) (see Sec. 86.53):
    (a) Standard Form 424 series as prescribed by the Office of 
Management and Budget. The SF 424 series consists of the Applications 
for Federal Assistance (SF 424), Budget Information--Non-Construction 
Programs (SF 424A), Assurances--Non-Construction Programs (SF 424B), 
Budget Information--Construction Programs (SF 424C), and Assurances--
Construction Programs (SF 424D). Submit forms appropriate for either 
construction or nonconstruction projects. Forms are available from your 
appropriate Service Regional Office.
    (b) Information requested under OMB Circular A-102 (Application 
Booklet for Federal Aid Grants--pending approval under the Paperwork 
Reduction Act).


<R05>
Sec. 86.53  What are funding tiers?

    (a) This grant program will consist of two tiers of funding.
    (i) You may apply for one or both tiers.
    (ii) The two tiers will allow all States some certainty of base 
level funding.
    (b) Tier One funding will ensure broad geographical distribution to 
meet the needs of transient nontrailerable recreational vessels.
    (c) Tier Two funding will allow States with large projects to 
compete with other States with large projects based on individual 
project merits.
    (d) We describe the two tiers as follows:
    (1) Tier One Projects. (i) You may submit a proposal with an 
unlimited number of projects within this tier. However, your total 
request cannot exceed $100,000 of Federal funds for any given fiscal 
year.
    (ii) Tier One projects must meet the eligibility requirements in 
Sec. Sec. 86.14 and 86.20.
    (2) Tier Two Projects. (i) While we expect available funds for Tier 
Two proposals to be between $3 million and $4 million per grant cycle, 
we have no dollar limit for Tier Two proposals. You may submit any 
number of projects, which we will score and rank separately according to 
the criteria in Sec. 86.60.
    (ii) Each project will compete nationally against every other 
project in Tier Two.
    (iii) Tier Two projects must also meet the eligibility requirements 
in Sec. Sec. 86.14 and 86.20.


<R05>
Sec. 86.54  How must I submit proposals?

    (a) You may apply for either Tier One funding or Tier Two funding or 
both.
    (b) You may submit more than one project proposal within Tier One 
and Tier Two.
    (c) You may submit one proposal that includes Tier One and Tier Two 
projects.
    (d) If your proposal includes Tier One and Tier Two projects, you 
must describe Tier One projects separately from Tier Two projects.
    (e) You must describe each project in Tier Two separately, so that 
the Service can rank and score each project in Tier Two separately.
    (f) For the first grant cycle, which includes fiscal years 2000 and 
2001, a State may submit one Tier One proposal not to exceed $100,000 
per fiscal year. States should submit proposals between February 20, 
2001, and May 18, 2001. We will fund one Tier One proposal per State for 
each fiscal year provided that each proposal meets the eligibility 
requirements in Sec. Sec. 86.14 and 86.20. Fiscal year 2000 funds are 
available only for Tier One proposals. Tier One proposals need not meet 
the criteria in Sec. 86.60. We will fund Tier Two proposals received 
between February 20, 2001, and May 18, 2001, that meet the criteria in 
Sec. Sec. 86.14, 86.20, and 86.60 with fiscal year 2001 funds and the 
remainder of fiscal year 2000 funds.
    (g) For the remaining grant cycles, you may submit only one proposal 
of Tier One projects per fiscal year.
    (h) When we approve projects, the appropriate Service Regional 
Office will determine how many grant agreements are necessary.


<R05>
Sec. 86.55  What are my compliance requirements with Federal laws,

regulations, and policies?

    (a) To receive Federal funds, you must agree to and certify 
compliance

[[Page 559]]

with all applicable Federal laws, regulations, and policies. You must 
submit an Assurance Statement, as described in 43 CFR part 12.51(c), 
that describes how you comply with Federal grant requirements; and
    (b) You may have to provide additional documentation to comply with 
environmental and other laws, as defined in Fish and Wildlife Service 
Manual 523 FW 1 (available on the internet at http://www.fws.gov/
directives/523fw1.html). The Service Regional Office Grant Administrator 
may request preliminary evidence at the grant proposal stage that the 
proposed project will meet these compliance requirements. Consult with 
the appropriate Service Regional Office for specific applicability.


<R04>
      Subpart F_How the Service Selects Projects To Receive Grants


<R05>
Sec. 86.60  What are the criteria used to select projects for grants?

    (a) We will rank all Tier Two proposals according to the criteria in 
paragraph (b) of this section and the attached chart, which sets forth 
points we will ascribe for various factors.
    (b) We will consider proposals that:

(1) Plan to construct, renovate, and maintain    15 points.
 tie-up facilities for transient nontrailerable
 recreational vessels following priorities
 identified in your State's program plan (see
 Subpart M for State program plan information)
 that the Secretary of the Interior has
 approved under section 7404(c) of the
 Sportfishing and Boating Safety Act.
(2) Provide for public/private and public/
 public partnership efforts to develop,
 renovate, and maintain tie-up facilities.
 These partners must be other than the Service
 and lead State agency:
    (i) One partner............................  5 points.
    (ii) Two partners..........................  10 points.
    (iii) Three or more partners...............  15 points.
(3) Use innovative techniques to increase the    0-15 points.
 availability of tie-up facilities for
 transient nontrailerable recreational vessels
 (includes education/information).
(4) Include private, local, or other State
 funds in addition to the non-Federal match,
 described in Sec.  86.42:
    (i) Twenty-six percent to thirty-five        5 points.
     percent.
    (ii) Between thirty-six and forty-nine       10 points.
     percent.
    (iii) Fifty percent and above..............  15 points.
(5) Are cost efficient. Proposals are cost       0-10 points.
 efficient when the tie-up facility or access
 site's features add a high value compared with
 the funds from the proposal, for example,
 where you construct a small feature such as a
 transient mooring dock within an existing
 harbor that adds high value and opportunity to
 existing features (restrooms, utilities,
 etc.). A proposal that requires installing all
 of the above features would add less value for
 the cost.
(6) Provide a significant link to prominent      10 points.
 destination way points such as those near
 metropolitan population centers, cultural or
 natural areas, or that provide safe harbors
 from storms.
(7) Provide access to recreational, historic,
 cultural, natural, or scenic opportunities of
 national, regional, or local significance.
 Projects that provide access to opportunities
 of national, regional, or local significance
 receive 5 points for each, for a maximum of 15
 points
(8) Provide significant positive economic        1-5 points.
 impacts to a community. For example, a project
 that costs $100,000 and attracts a number of
 boaters who altogether spend $1 million a year
 in the community.
(9) Include multi-State efforts that result in   5 points.
 coordinating location of tie-up facilities.
(10) Total possible points.....................  105 points.

<R05>
Sec. 86.61  What process does the Service use to select projects for

grants?

    The Service's Division of Federal Aid convenes a panel of 
professional staff to review, rank, and recommend funding to the Service 
Director. This panel will include representatives from the Service's 
Washington, DC, and Regional Offices. The Director may convene an 
advisory panel of nongovernmental organizations to advise and make 
recommendations to the Federal panel. The Service Director will select 
projects for grants by August 16, 2001, August 10, 2001, and August 10, 
2002, for the three grant cycles.


<R05>
Sec. 86.62  What must I do after my project has been selected?

    After we approve your award, we will notify you to work with the 
appropriate Service Regional Office to fulfill the grant documentation 
requirements and finalize the grant agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 86.63  May I appeal if my project is not selected?

    If you have a difference of opinion over the eligibility of proposed 
activities or differences arising over the conduct of work, you may 
appeal to the Director. Final determination rests with the Secretary of 
the Interior (50 CFR 80.7).


<R04>
                   Subpart G_How States Manage Grants


<R05>
Sec. 86.70  What are my requirements to acquire, install, operate, 

and maintain real and personal property?

    (a) You will find applicable regulations for this subject in 43 CFR 
12.71 and 12.72. If you have questions about applicability, contact the 
appropriate Service Regional Office.
    (b) You must ensure that the design and installation of tie-up 
facilities provide for substantial structures that will have a 
significant longevity, at least 20 years.
    (c) You must ensure that you operate, maintain, and use the tie-up 
facilities and features for the stated grant purpose. You must obtain 
prior written approval from the appropriate Service Regional Director 
before you can convert these tie-up facilities to other uses.


<R05>
Sec. 86.71  How will I be reimbursed?

    For details on how we will pay you, refer to 43 CFR 12.61.


<R05>
Sec. 86.72  Do any other Federal requirements apply to this program?

    For administrative requirements not covered under these specific 
guidelines, check 43 CFR 12, which generally applies to all Federal 
grant programs.


<R05>
Sec. 86.73  What if I do not spend all the money?

    Funds not obligated or expended after 3 fiscal years from the date 
of the award revert to the Secretary of Transportation for use in State 
recreational boating safety programs. (16 U.S.C. 777c(b)(3)(B), 16 
U.S.C. 777c(b)(4))


<R05>
Sec. 86.74  What if I need more money?

    Funds for grants are available only on a competitive basis. 
Therefore, if you need more money, you must compete in the next grant 
cycle.


<R04>

<R04>
     Subpart I_State Use of Signs and Sport Fish Restoration Symbols


<R05>
Sec. 86.90  What are my responsibilities for information signs?

    You should install appropriate information signs at boating 
infrastructure tie-up facilities. You should ensure that this 
information is clearly visible, directing boaters to the facility. 
Information should show fees, restrictions, hours of operation, a 
contact name, and telephone number to report an inoperable facility.


<R05>
Sec. 86.91  What are my program crediting responsibilities?

    You should give public credit to the Federal Aid in Sport Fish 
Restoration (SFR) program as the source of funding for the BIG Program. 
You should recognize this program by using the SFR logo. You are 
encouraged to use the crediting logo identified in Sec. 80.26 of this 
chapter to identify national BIG Program projects.


<R05>
Sec. 86.92  Who can use the SFR logo?

    The States may use the SFR logo and should encourage others to 
display it. Other people or organizations may use the logo for purposes 
related to the national BIG Program as authorized in Sec. 80.26 of this

<R04>
         Subpart J_Service Completion of the National Framework


<R05>
Sec. 86.100  What is the National Framework?

    The National Framework is the survey, required by the Act, you must 
use to determine boating access needs in your State. Through a State 
survey, you must conduct a boating access needs assessment or data 
collection to determine the adequacy, number, location, and quality of 
tie-up facilities and boat access sites providing access to recreational 
waters for all sizes of recreational boats.


<R05>
Sec. 86.101  What is the Service schedule to adopt the National Framework?

    The Secretary of the Interior adopted the National Framework on 
September 28, 2000 via a notice in the Federal Register (Volume 65, 
Number 189, Page 58284).

[[Page 562]]


<R05>
Sec. 86.102  How did the Service design the National Framework?

    The Framework divides the survey into two components: boater survey, 
and boat access provider survey.
    (a) The purpose of the boater survey component is to identify boat 
user preferences and concerns for existing and needed access available 
to the public.
    (1) The nontrailerable boat data set will fulfill informational 
needs for you to develop your State program plans as called for in the 
Act.
    (2) The boater survey will survey registered boat owners in your 
State for two types of boats:
    (i) Part A--for nontrailerable recreational vessels.
    (ii) Part B--for trailerable and ``car-top'' boats (less than 26 
feet long).
    (b) The purpose of the boat access provider component is to identify 
boat access providers' ideas about current and needed facility and site 
locations and perceptions of boat user preferences and concerns 
regarding access. We developed these questions to guide interviews of 
boat access facility and site managers.
    (1) The nontrailerable boat data set will fulfill the informational 
needs for you to develop your State plans as called for in the Act.
    (2) The boat access provider survey will survey facility providers 
in your State for two types of boats:
    (i) Part C--a survey to all providers in your State who allow public 
access, including State agency and non-State entities (Federal and local 
government entities, corporate and private/commercial providers), and 
operate tie-up facilities for nontrailerable recreational vessels.
    (ii) Part D--a survey to all providers in your State who allow 
public access and operate boat access sites for boats less than 26 feet 
long.


<R04>
         Subpart K_How States Will Complete Access Needs Surveys


<R05>
Sec. 86.110  What does the State survey do?

    The State survey determines the status of boating access facilities 
for all recreational boats in your State and your future boater access 
needs.


<R05>
Sec. 86.111  Must I do a survey?

    The Act does not require surveys. They are voluntary. However, if 
you do a survey, you must complete it following the National Framework 
to receive funds. You must transmit the results to the Service Regional 
Offices in a common electronic format, such as Microsoft Word, Word 
Perfect, Excel or Quattro Pro.


<R05>
Sec. 86.112  What are the advantages of doing a survey?

    Surveys provide the information necessary to fully understand the 
needs of boaters in your State. Surveys allow you to develop a 
meaningful plan to provide better access to boaters. Use surveys to 
complete the plan.


<R05>
Sec. 86.113  What if I have recently completed a boat access survey?

    If the recent survey substantially answers the provisions in Sec. 
86.118, the appropriate Service Regional Office will determine if it is 
sufficient to meet the needs of the program. If the Regional Office 
determines that the survey is not sufficient, you must complete that 
portion(s) or an entire new survey to receive credit for completing a 
recent survey.


<R05>
Sec. 86.114  Do I need to conduct a survey if I already have a plan

for installing tie-up facilities?

    You need not conduct the survey if the appropriate Secretary of the 
Interior certifies that you have developed and are carrying out a State 
program plan, as described in Subpart M of this chapter, that ensures 
that public boat access exists and is adequate to meet the needs of 
recreational boaters on your waters.


<R05>
Sec. 86.115  How should I administer the survey?

    Use a consultant or university specializing in administration of 
such surveys. Use sample sizes large enough to achieve statistical 
accuracy so the estimate is within plus or minus 10 percent of the true 
number.
    (a) You may use a telephone, mail, or other type of survey for a 
sample population of boaters within the State. Costs for telephone and 
mail surveys are roughly similar. However, response

[[Page 563]]

rates for mail surveys are generally lower.
    (b) For boat access providers, we prefer that you survey all State 
agency and non-State providers, but you may survey a sample population.
    (c) You may develop your own methodology to collect data, which may 
include telephone, mail, fax, or other inventory means. We do not expect 
you to use automated, electronic, mechanical, or similar means of 
information collection.
    (d) Data collected are unique to each respondent. Data collection 
should use standard survey method criteria to gather information from 
each respondent.


<R05>
Sec. 86.116  May I change the questions in the survey?

    You must not change the questions because we need information that 
is comparable nationwide. We have developed a survey instrument for 
completing the surveys. We are seeking approval from OMB on the survey 
questions and the OMB approval does not extend to additional questions.


<R05>
Sec. 86.117  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 86.118  What does this survey instrument include?

    (a) We divided this survey into four parts. Part A being for 
transient nontrailerable boat owners. Part B is for trailerable or 
``car-top'' boat owners. Part C is for State agency and non-State 
providers of facilities for nontrailerable recreational vessels in the 
State. Part D is for State and non-State providers of access sites for 
trailerable or ``car-top'' boats.
    (b) Follow these instructions to complete Part A--BOAT OWNER SURVEY 
FOR TIE-UP FACILITIES FOR NONTRAILERABLE RECREATIONAL VESSELS:
    (1) If the boater owns a nontrailerable recreational vessel, ask the 
boater to fill out Part A;
    (2) If the boater owns more than one boat 26 feet or more in length, 
ask the boater to provide information for the boat he or she uses most 
often;
    (3) If the boater owns at least one boat more than and at least one 
boat less than 26 feet in length, ask the boater to fill out both Parts 
A and B; and,
    (4) You should use a sample size large enough to achieve statistical 
accuracy so the estimate is within 10 percent of the true number.
    (c) Follow these instructions to complete Part B--BOAT OWNER SURVEY 
FOR TRAILERABLE OR ``CAR-TOP'' BOAT ACCESS SITES:
    (1) If the boater owns a boat less than 26 feet long, ask the boater 
to fill out Part B;
    (2) If the boater owns more than one boat less than 26 feet long, 
ask the boater to provide information for the boat he or she uses most;
    (3) If the boater owns at least one boat more than and at least one 
boat less than 26 feet in length, ask the boater to complete both Parts 
A and B; and,
    (4) You should use a sample size large enough to achieve statistical 
accuracy so the estimate is within 10 percent of the true number.
    (d) Parts C and D are surveys for providers of tie-up facilities and 
boat access sites. Part C is for State agency and non-State providers of 
facilities for nontrailerable recreational vessels in the State. Part D 
is for State and non-State providers of boat access sites for boats less 
than 26 feet in length.
    (e) Follow these instructions to complete Part C--STATE AGENCY AND 
NON-STATE PROVIDER SURVEY FOR TIE-UP FACILITIES:
    (1) Ask State agency and non-State providers of tie-up facilities 
for nontrailerable recreational vessels to fill out Part C.
    (2) If more than one State agency manages these facilities, send 
this survey to all of those agencies.
    (3) If the State agency or non-State provider awards grants to 
others who provide facilities, ask these grantees to respond for these 
facilities instead of the State agency or non-State provider.
    (4) If a State agency or non-State provider operates facilities and 
sites for both nontrailerable and trailerable boats, ask the provider to 
fill out both Parts C and D.
    (5) Ask State agency and non-State providers to identify all tie-up 
facilities.

[[Page 564]]

    (6) For all questions, if you need additional space, make copies of 
the appropriate page.
    (f) Follow these instructions to complete Part D--STATE AGENCY AND 
NON-STATE PROVIDER SURVEY FOR TRAILERABLE BOAT ACCESS SITES:
    (1) Ask State agency and non-State providers of access sites for 
boats less than 26 feet long to fill out Part D.
    (2) Non-State providers include the Federal Government, local 
government, corporations, private owners, and others.
    (3) If more than one State agency manages these sites, send this 
survey to all of them.
    (4) If the State agency or non-State provider awards grants to 
others who provide sites, ask these grantees to respond for these sites 
instead of the State agency or non-State provider.
    (5) If a State agency or non-State provider operates facilities and 
sites for both nontrailerable and trailerable boats, ask the provider to 
fill out both Parts C and D.
    (6) We prefer that the State agency or non-State provider identify 
all boat access sites and water-bodies, but if he or she has many sites 
and water-bodies, the provider may group the information together rather 
than identify each site individually.
    (7) For all questions, if you need additional space, make copies of 
the appropriate page.

<R04>
                         Subpart A_Introduction


<R05>
Sec. 90.1  General.

    Any person having an interest in a crop and who is suffering damage 
due to depredations by migratory waterfowl may file a complaint and 
apply for surplus grain for use in feeding programs to augment the 
natural source of food available to migratory waterfowl to aid in the 
prevention of crop damage by such birds, as provided for in these 
regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 90.2  Scope of regulations.

    The provisions of this part supplement 70 Stat. 492, 7 U.S.C. 442-
445.


<R04>
                     Subpart B_Use of Surplus Grain


<R05>
Sec. 90.11  Statutory provisions.

    Section 1 of the Act of July 3, 1956, as amended (70 Stat. 492; 7 
U.S.C. 442-445) provides that the Commodity Credit Corporation shall 
make available to the Secretary of the Interior such wheat, corn, or 
other grains, acquired through price support operations and certified by 
the Corporation to be available for purposes of the Act or in such 
condition through spoilage or deterioration as not to be desirable for 
human consumption, as the Secretary shall requisition for the purpose of 
preventing crop damage by migratory waterfowl. Section 2 of the Act 
provides that, upon a finding that any area in the United States is 
threatened with damage to farmers' crops by migratory waterfowl, the 
Secretary is authorized and directed to requisition from the Commodity 
Credit Corporation and to make available to Federal, State, or local 
governmental bodies or officials, or to private organizations or 
persons, such grain acquired by the Corporation through price support 
operations in such quantities and subject to such regulations as the 
Secretary determines will most effectively lure migratory waterfowl away 
from crop depredations and at the same time not expose such migratory 
waterfowl to shooting over areas to which the waterfowl have been lured 
by such feeding programs.


<R05>
Sec. 90.12  Interpretation.

    The authorization contained in the Act limits the availability of 
grain acquired through price support operations to the prevention of 
crop damage by migratory waterfowl (brant, wild ducks, geese, and swans) 
and such grain may not be made available for the feeding of any other 
species of migratory birds, whether or not such other species of 
migratory birds are committing or threatening to commit crop damage. 
Further, the Act does not authorize the use of such grain to conduct a 
migratory waterfowl feeding program for the purpose of augmenting 
natural sources of food available to migratory waterfowl, nor for any 
purpose incident to migratory waterfowl management not related to the 
prevention of crop damage. Accordingly, such grain shall not be made 
available pursuant to the Act to augment or to substitute for natural 
sources of migratory waterfowl food except as may be determined by the 
Secretary to be necessary to aid in the prevention of crop damage by 
such birds.

[[Page 567]]


<R05>
Sec. 90.13  Policy.

    Whenever it is found necessary to conduct feeding programs under 
this section for the purposes of preventing crop damage by migratory 
waterfowl, it shall be the policy of the Secretary for the purposes of 
economy and efficiency to accord preference to feeding programs proposed 
to be executed through the placement of grain upon wildlife management 
areas or other lands or waters owned, leased, or otherwise controlled by 
an agency of the United States or a State.


<R05>
Sec. 90.14  Waterfowl depredation complaints; where filed.

    Any person having an interest in crops being damaged or threatened 
with damage by migratory waterfowl in circumstances meeting the criteria 
prescribed in Sec. 90.15 may make application for grain for use in 
luring such waterfowl away from such crops by submitting a written 
request to the Regional Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
regional office having administrative jurisdiction over the wildlife 
activities in the State where the affected crops are located. (See Sec. 
2.2 for geographical jurisdiction and addresses of regional offices.) 
Such applications may be in letter form but must contain information 
disclosing the location, nature, condition and extent of the crops being 
damaged or threatened, and the particular species of migratory waterfowl 
committing or threatening to commit damage. For the purposes of this 
section any authorized official of Federal, State, or local governmental 
body shall be deemed to be a ``person'' and to have such an interest in 
crops threatened with damages as to qualify him as an applicant.


<R05>
Sec. 90.15  Criteria to govern approval of applications.

    Upon receipt of a written application for such grain for use in 
preventing crop depredations, the Regional Director shall promptly cause 
an investigation to be made, when necessary, to determine whether the 
applicant is in fact entitled to have such grain made available for such 
purposes. Whenever feasible the required investigation shall be made 
jointly by a representative of the game department of the State in which 
the affected crops are located and a representative of the Regional 
Director. When conducting such investigations, each of the factors set 
forth in paragraphs (a) to (d) of this section shall be considered 
separately. An application for grain shall not be approved if it is 
determined that one or more of these factors minimizes the extent of 
crop damage or provides another effective method of preventing the 
complained of damage.
    (a) The migratory waterfowl committing or threatening to commit crop 
damage must be predominantly of a species which are susceptible of being 
effectively lured away from the crops by the use of such grain.
    (b) The crop damage or threatened crop damage must be substantial in 
nature (when measured by the extent and potential value of the crops 
involved and the number of birds threatening damage); and must affect 
growing crops or mature unharvested crops that are in such condition as 
to be marketable or have value as feed for livestock or other purposes 
of material value to the applicant.
    (c) It must be shown that the damage or threat of damage cannot be 
abated through the exercise of any of the privileges granted in permits 
authorized by this chapter I to frighten or otherwise herd migratory 
waterfowl away from affected crops.
    (d) During an open hunting season, it must be shown that the area 
affected by crop damage has been and is now open to public hunting and 
there has been a clear demonstration that such hunting is ineffective, 
and cannot be made effective, to prevent crop damage on such area.


<R05>
Sec. 90.16  Actions following investigation.

    Upon receipt of a report and recommendations based upon an 
investigation conducted under Sec. 90.15, the Secretary shall make a 
determination that the applicant meets the qualifications for receiving 
grain. He shall then determine the quantity of grain, either bagged or 
in bulk, to be made available; the means of transportation; and the 
point of delivery in the vicinity of the crop damage. Before receiving 
delivery of such grain the applicant shall

[[Page 568]]

execute and deliver to any officer authorized to enforce this part 
written assurances as follows:
    (a) That grain made available to him under this part will be used 
exclusively for the prevention and abatement of crop damage by migratory 
waterfowl and that no portion of such grain will be sold, donated, 
exchanged, or used as feed for livestock or other domestic animals or 
for any other purpose;
    (b) That consent is granted to any officer authorized to enforce 
this part, to inspect, supervise or direct the placement and 
distribution of grain made available under this part for the prevention 
of crop damage at all reasonable times;
    (c) That free and unrestricted access over the premises on which 
feeding operations have been or are to be conducted shall be permitted 
at all reasonable times, by any officer authorized to enforce this part 
and that such information as may be required by the officer will be 
promptly furnished; and
    (d) That the applicant will not take, nor permit his agents, 
employees, invitees, or other persons under his control to take 
migratory game birds on or over any lands or waters subject to his 
control, during the time such grain is placed, exposed, deposited, 
distributed, scattered, or present upon such lands or waters, nor for a 
period of 10 days immediately following the consumption or removal of 
such grain from such lands or waters.


<R05>
Sec. 90.17  Compliance with other regulations.

    Nothing in this subpart shall be construed to supersede or modify 
any regulations relating to the hunting of migratory game birds, nor to 
permit the transportation, installation or use of grain contrary to any 
applicable Federal, State, or local laws or regulations.

<R05>
Sec. 91.14  Restrictions on subject matter for entry.

    A live portrayal of any bird(s) of the five or fewer identified 
eligible species must be the dominant feature of the design. The design 
may depict more than one of the eligible species. Designs may include, 
but are not limited to, hunting dogs, hunting scenes, use of waterfowl 
decoys, National Wildlife Refuges as the background of habitat scenes, 
noneligible species, or other designs that depict uses of the stamp for 
sporting, conservation, and collecting purposes. The overall mandate 
will be to select the best design that will make an interesting, useful, 
and attractive duck stamp that will be accepted and prized by hunters, 
stamp collectors, conservationists, and others. The design must be the 
contestant's original hand-drawn creation. The entry design may not be 
copied or duplicated from previously published art, including 
photographs, or from images in any format published on the Internet.

<R05>
Sec. 91.15  Suitability of entry for engraving.

    All entries should be drawn with fullest attention to clarity of 
detail and the relationship of tonal values. These

[[Page 571]]

prerequisites are important to interpret pictorial elements to hand 
engraving for printing, as they determine the engraved line techniques 
and direction. The engraver relies on the accuracy of the artist's work 
for successful interpretation. The engraver is primarily responsible for 
line interpretation and discipline, creating the miniature image of 
bird(s) appearing on the stamp.

Sec. 91.17  Property insurance for contest entries.

    Each contestant is responsible for obtaining adequate insurance 
coverage for his/her entry. Neither the Service nor the Department of

responsible for loss or damage unless such is caused by Service or 
Department negligence or willful misconduct. The Service and Department 
reserve the right to determine whether negligence or willful misconduct 
led to artwork being damaged. Entry fees for the subsequent year's 
contest may be waived for artists whose artwork we determine to be 
damaged by any negligence on our part. This waiver remains at our 
discretion.

designations of communities for public comment in the Federal Register. 
Excluded areas consist of the following:
    (1) All areas outside of Alaska.
    (2) Village areas located in Anchorage, the Matanuska-Susitna 
Borough, the Kenai Peninsula roaded area, the Gulf of Alaska roaded 
area, Southeast Alaska, and the Central Interior Excluded Area as 
described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section generally do not qualify 
for a spring and summer harvest.
    (3) The Central Interior Excluded Area comprises the following: That 
portion of Unit 20(A) east of the Wood River drainage and south of Rex 
Trail, including the upper Wood River drainage south of its confluence 
with Chicken Creek; that portion of Unit 20(C) east of Denali National 
Park north to Rock Creek and east to Unit 20(A); and that portion of 
Unit 20(D) west of the Tanana River between its confluence with the 
Johnson and Delta Rivers, west of the east bank of the Johnson River, 
and north and west of the Volmar drainage, including the Goodpaster 
River drainage. The following communities are within the Excluded Area: 
Delta Junction/Big Delta/Fort Greely, McKinley Park/Village, Healy, 
Ferry, and all residents of the formerly named Fairbanks North Star 
Borough Excluded Area.
    (c) Criteria for determining designation as a spring and summer 
subsistence harvest area. A previously excluded community may be 
included in the spring/summer harvest regulations if recommended by the 
Alaska Migratory Bird Co-management Council. The Alaska Migratory Bird 
Co-management Council will recommend designation of subsistence harvest 
areas based on a deliberative process using the best available 
information on nutritional and cultural needs and customary and

[[Page 576]]

traditional use. The Alaska Migratory Bird Co-management Council 
recommendations will accommodate traditional spring and summer harvests 
without creating new traditions or increasing harvest of migratory 
birds. Recommendations will be made based on the majority of factors and 
the weight of the evidence using the following criteria:
    (1) A pattern of use recurring in the spring and summer of each year 
prior to 1999, excluding interruptions by circumstances beyond the 
user's control;
    (2) The consistent harvest and use of migratory birds on or near the 
user's permanent residence;
    (3) A use pattern that includes the handing down of knowledge of 
hunting skills and values from generation to generation;
    (4) A use pattern in which migratory birds are shared or distributed 
among others within a definable community of persons; a community for 
purposes of subsistence uses may include specific villages or towns, 
with a historical pattern of subsistence use; and
    (5) A use pattern that includes reliance for subsistence purposes 
upon migratory birds or their eggs and that meets nutritional and other 
essential needs including, but not limited to, cultural, social, and 
economic elements of the subsistence way of life.
    (d) Participation by permanent residents of excluded areas. 
Immediate family members who are permanent residents of excluded areas 
may participate in the customary spring and summer subsistence harvest 
in a village's subsistence harvest area with the permission of the 
village council, where it is appropriate to assist indigenous 
inhabitants in meeting their nutritional and other essential needs or 
for the teaching of cultural knowledge to or by their immediate family 
members. Eligibility for participation will be developed and recommended 
by the Co-management Council and adopted or amended by regulations 
published in subpart D of this part.

Sec. 92.11  Regional management areas.

    (a) Regions identified. To allow for maximum participation by 
residents of subsistence eligible areas, the Alaska Regional Director of 
the Service established 12 geographic regions based on common 
subsistence resource use patterns and the 12 Alaska Native regional 
corporation boundaries established under the Alaska Native Claims 
Settlement Act. Despite using the Alaska Native regional corporation 
boundaries, we are not working directly with the regional corporations 
in this program and are instead working with the Alaska Native nonprofit 
groups and local governments in those corresponding regions. You may 
obtain records and maps delineating the boundaries of the 12 regions 
from the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management, 
Alaska State Office, 222 West 7th Ave., No. 13, Anchorage, AK 99513. The 
regions are identified as follows:
    (1) Aleutian/Pribilof Islands;
    (2) Kodiak Archipelago;
    (3) Bristol Bay;

[[Page 578]]

    (4) Yukon/Kuskokwim Delta;
    (5) Bering Strait/Norton Sound;
    (6) Northwest Arctic;
    (7) North Slope;
    (8) Interior;
    (9) Southeast;
    (10) Gulf of Alaska;
    (11) Upper Copper River; and
    (12) Cook Inlet.
    (b) Regional partnerships. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will 
establish partner agreements with at least 1 partner organization in 
each of the 12 regions. The partner organization identified must be 
willing and able to coordinate the regional program on behalf of all 
subsistence hunters within that region. A regional partner will:
    (1) Organize or identify one or more management bodies within the 
region in which it is located.
    (2) Determine how the management body for the region should be 
organized, the manner in which it should function, its size, who serves 
on it, the length of terms, methods of involving subsistence users, and 
other related matters.
    (3) Coordinate regional meetings and the solicitation of proposals.
    (4) Ensure appointment of a person to represent the region by 
serving on the Co-management Council. If a region consists of more than 
one partner organization, each partner organization may appoint a member 
to sit on the Co-management Council.
    (5) Keep the residents of villages within the region informed of 
issues related to the subsistence harvest of migratory birds.
    (6) Work cooperatively with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and 
the Alaska Department of Fish and Game to gather harvest data, numbers 
of subsistence users, and other management data and traditional 
knowledge for the benefit of the management bodies.
    (c) Regional management bodies. (1) Regional management bodies must 
provide a forum for the collection and expression of opinions and 
recommendations regarding spring and summer subsistence harvesting of 
migratory birds. They must develop requests and recommendations from the 
region to be presented to the Co-management Council for deliberation. 
They must provide for public participation in the meetings at which 
recommendations and requests are formulated.
    (2) Requests and recommendations to the Co-management Council may 
involve seasons and bag limits, methods and means, law enforcement 
policies, population and harvest monitoring, education programs, 
research and use of traditional knowledge, habitat protection, and other 
concerns related to migratory bird subsistence programs.
    (3) Regional management bodies may be established specifically for 
the purpose of carrying out the responsibilities identified in this 
part, or they may be existing entities that can add these 
responsibilities to their existing duties.

Sec. 92.12  Relationship to the process for developing national hunting 

regulations for migratory game birds.

    (a) Flyway councils. (1) Proposed annual regulations recommended by 
the Co-management Council will be submitted to all flyway councils for 
review and comment. The Council's recommendations must be submitted 
prior to the SRC's last regular meeting of the calendar year in order to 
be approved for spring/summer harvest beginning March 11 of the 
following calendar year.
    (2) Alaska Native representatives may be appointed by the Co-
management Council to attend meetings of one or more of the four flyway 
councils to discuss recommended regulations or other proposed management 
actions.

Sec. 92.21  Emergency closures.

    (a) The Regional Director, after consultation with the Co-management 
Council, may close or temporarily suspend any regulation established 
under subparts C or D of this part:
    (1) Upon finding that a continuation of the regulation would pose an 
imminent threat to the conservation of any endangered or threatened 
species or other migratory bird population; and
    (2) Upon issuance of local public notice by such means as 
publication in local newspapers of general circulation, posting of the 
areas affected, notifying the State wildlife conservation agency, and 
announcement on the internet and local radio and television.
    (b) The Service will also announce any such closure or temporary 
suspension by publication of a notice in the Federal Register 
simultaneously with the local public notice referred to in paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section. However, in the event that publishing a Federal 
Register notice simultaneously with the local public notice is 
impractical, we will publish in the Federal Register as soon as possible 
after the steps outlined in paragraph (a) of this section are taken.
    (c) Any closure or temporary suspension under this section will be 
effective on the date of publication of the Federal Register notice; or 
if such notice is not published simultaneously with the notification 
methods described in paragraph (a) of this section, then on the date and 
at the time specified in the local notification to the public given 
under paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Every notice of closure or 
temporary suspension will include the date and time of the closing, the 
area or areas affected, and the species affected. In the case of a 
temporary suspension, the date and time when the harvest may be resumed 
will also be provided by local notification to the public and

<R04>
       Subpart D_Annual Regulations Governing Subsistence Harvest


<R05>
Sec. 92.30  General overview of regulations.

    These regulations establish a spring/summer migratory bird 
subsistence harvest in Alaska. The regulations list migratory bird 
species that are authorized for harvest, species that are not authorized 
for harvest, season dates, and dates for a 30-day closure to protect 
nesting birds. The Co-management Council will review and, if necessary, 
recommend modifications to these harvest regulations on an annual basis, 
working within the schedule of the Federal late-season regulations for 
migratory game bird hunting.
    (a) The taking, possession, transportation, and other uses of 
migratory birds are generally prohibited unless specifically authorized 
by regulation developed in accordance with the Migratory Bird Treaty 
Act. Therefore, harvesting migratory birds is prohibited unless 
regulations are established ensuring the protection of the various 
populations of migratory birds. Migratory bird population levels, 
production, and habitat conditions vary annually. These conditions 
differ within Alaska and throughout North America. Therefore, the 
regulations governing migratory bird hunting may include annual 
adjustments to keep harvests within acceptable levels.
    (b) The development of the regulations in this part, like the 
development of the annual migratory game bird hunting regulations in 
part 20 of this chapter, involves annual data gathering programs to 
determine migratory bird population status and trends, evaluate habitat 
conditions, determine harvests, and consider other factors having an 
impact on the anticipated size of annual populations.
    (c) The Service proposes annual migratory game bird hunting 
regulations in the Federal Register in the spring for seasons beginning 
September 1 of that year. Following consideration of additional 
biological information and public comment, the Service publishes 
supplemental proposals throughout the summer. These are also open to 
public comment.
    (d) Sections 92.31 through 92.39 provide for the annual harvest of 
migratory birds and their eggs during spring and summer for subsistence 
users in Alaska.

<R05>
Sec. 100.5  Eligibility for subsistence use.

    (a) You may take fish and wildlife on public lands for subsistence 
uses only if you are an Alaska resident of a rural area or rural 
community. The regulations in this part may further limit your 
qualifications to harvest fish or wildlife resources for subsistence 
uses. If you are not an Alaska resident or are a resident of a non-rural 
area or community listed in Sec. 100.23, you may not take fish or 
wildlife on public lands for subsistence uses under the regulations in 
this part.
    (b) Where the Board has made a customary and traditional use 
determination regarding subsistence use of a specific fish stock or 
wildlife population, in accordance with, and as listed in, Sec. 100.24, 
only those Alaskans who are residents of rural areas or communities 
designated by the Board are eligible for subsistence taking of that 
population or stock on public lands for subsistence uses under the 
regulations in this part. If you do not live in one of those areas or 
communities, you may not take fish or wildlife from that population or 
stock, on public lands under the regulations in this part.
    (c) Where customary and traditional use determinations for a fish 
stock or wildlife population within a specific area have not yet been 
made by the Board (e.g., ``no determination''), all Alaskans who are 
residents of rural areas or communities may harvest for subsistence from 
that stock or population under the regulations in this part.
    (d) The National Park Service may regulate further the eligibility 
of those individuals qualified to engage in subsistence uses on National 
Park Service lands in accordance with specific authority in ANILCA, and 
National Park Service regulations at 36 CFR Part 13.


<R05>
Sec. 100.6  Licenses, permits, harvest tickets, tags, and reports.

    (a) If you wish to take fish and wildlife on public lands for 
subsistence uses, you must be an eligible rural Alaska resident and:
    (1) Possess the pertinent valid Alaska resident hunting and trapping 
licenses (no license required to take fish or shellfish, but you must be 
an Alaska resident) unless Federal licenses are required or unless 
otherwise provided for in subpart D of this part;
    (2) Possess and comply with the provisions of any pertinent Federal 
permits (Federal Subsistence Registration Permit or Federal Designated 
Harvester Permit) required by subpart D of this part; and

[[Page 586]]

    (3) Possess and comply with the provisions of any pertinent permits, 
harvest tickets, or tags required by the State unless any of these 
documents or individual provisions in them are superseded by the 
requirements in subpart D of this part.
    (b) In order to receive a Federal Subsistence Registration Permit or 
Federal Designated Harvester Permit or designate someone to harvest fish 
or wildlife for you under a Federal Designated Harvester Permit, you 
must be old enough to reasonably harvest that species yourself (or under 
the guidance of an adult).
    (c) If you have been awarded a permit to take fish and wildlife, you 
must have that permit in your possession during the taking and must 
comply with all requirements of the permit and the regulations in this 
section pertaining to validation and reporting and to regulations in 
subpart D of this part pertaining to methods and means, possession and 
transportation, and utilization. Upon the request of a State or Federal 
law enforcement agent, you must also produce any licenses, permits, 
harvest tickets, tags, or other documents required by this section. If 
you are engaged in taking fish and wildlife under the regulations in 
this part, you must allow State or Federal law enforcement agents to 
inspect any apparatus designed to be used, or capable of being used to 
take fish or wildlife, or any fish or wildlife in your possession.
    (d) You must validate the harvest tickets, tags, permits, or other 
required documents before removing your kill from the harvest site. You 
must also comply with all reporting provisions as set forth in subpart D 
of this part.
    (e) If you take fish and wildlife under a community harvest system, 
you must report the harvest activity in accordance with regulations 
specified for that community in subpart D of this part, and as required 
by any applicable permit conditions. Individuals may be responsible for 
particular reporting requirements in the conditions permitting a 
specific community's harvest. Failure to comply with these conditions is 
a violation of the regulations in this part. Community harvests are 
reviewed annually under the regulations in subpart D of this part.
    (f) You may not make a fraudulent application for Federal or State 
licenses, permits, harvest tickets or tags or intentionally file an 
incorrect harvest report.

<R05>
Sec. 100.7  Restriction on use.

    (a) You may not use fish or wildlife or their parts, taken pursuant 
to the regulations in this part, unless provided for in this part.
    (b) You may not exchange in customary trade or sell fish or wildlife 
or their parts, taken pursuant to the regulations in this part, unless 
provided for in this part.
    (c) You may barter fish or wildlife or their parts, taken pursuant 
to the regulations in this part, unless restricted in Sec. Sec. 100.25, 
100.26, 100.27, or 100.28.


<R05>
Sec. 100.8  Penalties.

    If you are convicted of violating any provision of 50 CFR Part 100 
or 36 CFR Part 242, you may be punished by a fine or by imprisonment in 
accordance with the penalty provisions applicable to the public land 
where the violation occurred.


<R05>
Sec. 100.9  Information collection requirements.

    (a) The rules in this part contain information collection 
requirements subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval 
under 44 U.S.C. 3501-3520. They apply to fish and wildlife harvest 
activities on public lands in Alaska. Subsistence users will not be 
required to respond to an information collection request unless a valid 
OMB number is displayed on the information collection form.
    (1) Section 100.6, Licenses, permits, harvest tickets, tags, and 
reports. The information collection requirements contained in Sec. 
100.6 (Federal Subsistence Registration Permit or Federal Designated 
Harvester Permit forms) provide for permit-specific subsistence 
activities not authorized through the general adoption of State 
regulations. Identity and location of residence are required to 
determine if you are eligible for a permit and a report of success

[[Page 587]]

is required after a harvest attempt. These requirements are not 
duplicative with the requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this section. 
The regulations in Sec. 100.6 require this information before a rural 
Alaska resident may engage in subsistence uses on public lands. The 
Department estimates that the average time necessary to obtain and 
comply with this permit information collection requirement is 0.25 
hours.
    (2) Section 100.20, Request for reconsideration. The information 
collection requirements contained in Sec. 100.20 provide a standardized 
process to allow individuals the opportunity to appeal decisions of the 
Board. Submission of a request for reconsideration is voluntary but 
required to receive a final review by the Board. We estimate that a 
request for reconsideration will take 4 hours to prepare and submit.
    (3) The remaining information collection requirements contained in 
this part imposed upon subsistence users are those adopted from State 
regulations. These collection requirements would exist in the absence of 
Federal subsistence regulations and are not subject to the Paperwork 
Reduction Act. The burden in this situation is negligible, and 
information gained from these reports is systematically available to 
Federal managers by routine computer access requiring less than 1 hour.
    (b) You may direct comments on the burden estimate or any other 
aspect of the burden estimate to: Information Collection Officer, U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service, 1849 C Street, N.W., MS 222 ARLSQ, 
Washington, D.C. 20240; and the Office of Management and Budget, 
Paperwork Reduction Project (Subsistence), Washington, D.C. 20503. 
Additional information requirements may be imposed if Local Advisory 
Committees or additional Regional Councils, subject to the Federal 
Advisory Committee Act (FACA), are established under subpart B of this 
part. Such requirements will be submitted to OMB for approval prior to 
their implementation.

taking of fish and wildlife on public lands within their respective 
regions for subsistence uses. The Board may choose not to follow any 
Regional Council recommendation which it determines is not supported by 
substantial evidence, violates recognized principles of fish and 
wildlife conservation, would be detrimental to the satisfaction of 
subsistence needs, or in closure situations, for reasons of public 
safety or administration or to assure the continued viability of a 
particular fish or wildlife population. If a recommendation is not 
adopted, the Board shall set forth the factual basis and the reasons for 
the decision, in writing, in a timely fashion.

Sec. 100.13  Board/agency relationships.

    (a) General. (1) The Board, in making decisions or recommendations, 
shall consider and ensure compliance with specific statutory 
requirements regarding the management of resources on public lands, 
recognizing that the management policies applicable to some public lands 
may entail methods of resource and habitat management and protection 
different from methods appropriate for other public lands.
    (2) The Board shall issue regulations for subsistence taking of fish 
and wildlife on public lands. The Board is the final administrative 
authority on the

[[Page 591]]

promulgation of subparts C and D regulations relating to the subsistence 
taking of fish and wildlife on public lands.
    (3) Nothing in the regulations in this part shall enlarge or 
diminish the authority of any agency to issue regulations necessary for 
the proper management of public lands under their jurisdiction in 
accordance with ANILCA and other existing laws.
    (b) Section 808 of ANILCA establishes National Park and Park 
Monument Subsistence Resource Commissions. Nothing in the regulations in

the ground for denial.


<R05>
Sec. 100.15  Rural determination process.

    (a) The Board shall determine if an area or community in Alaska is 
rural. In determining whether a specific area of Alaska is rural, the 
Board shall use the following guidelines:
    (1) A community or area with a population of 2,500 or less shall be 
deemed to be rural unless such a community or area possesses significant 
characteristics of a non-rural nature, or is considered to be socially 
and economically a part of an urbanized area.
    (2) Communities or areas with populations above 2,500 but not more 
than 7,000 will be determined to be rural or non-rural.
    (3) A community with a population of more than 7,000 shall be 
presumed non-rural, unless such a community or area possesses 
significant characteristics of a rural nature.
    (4) Population data from the most recent census conducted by the 
United States Bureau of Census as updated by the Alaska Department of 
Labor shall be utilized in this process.
    (5) Community or area characteristics shall be considered in 
evaluating a community's rural or non-rural status. The characteristics 
may include, but are not limited to:
    (i) Use of fish and wildlife;
    (ii) Development and diversity of the economy;
    (iii) Community infrastructure;
    (iv) Transportation; and

[[Page 592]]

    (v) Educational institutions.
    (6) Communities or areas which are economically, socially, and 
communally integrated shall be considered in the aggregate.
    (b) The Board shall periodically review rural determinations. Rural 
determinations shall be reviewed on a 10-year cycle, commencing with the 
publication of the year 2000 U.S. census. Rural determinations may be 
reviewed out-of-cycle in special circumstances. Once the Board makes a 
determination that a community has changed from rural to non-rural, a 
waiting period of 5 years shall be required before the non-rural 
determination becomes effective.
    (c) Current determinations are listed at Sec. 100.23.


<R05>
Sec. 100.16  Customary and traditional use determination process.

    (a) The Board shall determine which fish stocks and wildlife 
populations have been customarily and traditionally used for 
subsistence. These determinations shall identify the specific 
community's or area's use of specific fish stocks and wildlife 
populations. For areas managed by the National Park Service, where 
subsistence uses are allowed, the determinations may be made on an 
individual basis.
    (b) A community or area shall generally exhibit the following 
factors, which exemplify customary and traditional use. The Board shall 
make customary and traditional use determinations based on application 
of the following factors:
    (1) A long-term consistent pattern of use, excluding interruptions 
beyond the control of the community or area;
    (2) A pattern of use recurring in specific seasons for many years;
    (3) A pattern of use consisting of methods and means of harvest 
which are characterized by efficiency and economy of effort and cost, 
conditioned by local characteristics;
    (4) The consistent harvest and use of fish or wildlife as related to 
past methods and means of taking; near, or reasonably accessible from, 
the community or area;
    (5) A means of handling, preparing, preserving, and storing fish or 
wildlife which has been traditionally used by past generations, 
including consideration of alteration of past practices due to recent 
technological advances, where appropriate;
    (6) A pattern of use which includes the handing down of knowledge of 
fishing and hunting skills, values, and lore from generation to 
generation;
    (7) A pattern of use in which the harvest is shared or distributed 
within a definable community of persons; and
    (8) A pattern of use which relates to reliance upon a wide diversity 
of fish and wildlife resources of the area and which provides 
substantial cultural, economic, social, and nutritional elements to the 
community or area.
    (c) The Board shall take into consideration the reports and 
recommendations of any appropriate Regional Council regarding customary 
and traditional uses of subsistence resources.
    (d) Current determinations are listed in Sec. 100.24.


<R05>
Sec. 100.17  Determining priorities for subsistence uses among rural

Alaska residents.

    (a) Whenever it is necessary to restrict the subsistence taking of 
fish and wildlife on public lands in order to protect the continued 
viability of such populations, or to continue subsistence uses, the 
Board shall establish a priority among the rural Alaska residents after 
considering any recommendation submitted by an appropriate Regional 
Council.
    (b) The priority shall be implemented through appropriate 
limitations based on the application of the following criteria to each 
area, community, or individual determined to have customary and 
traditional use, as necessary:
    (1) Customary and direct dependence upon the populations as the 
mainstay of livelihood;
    (2) Local residency; and
    (3) The availability of alternative resources.
    (c) If allocation on an area or community basis is not achievable, 
then the Board shall allocate subsistence opportunity on an individual 
basis through application of the criteria in paragraphs (b)(1) through 
(3) of this section.

[[Page 593]]

    (d) In addressing a situation where prioritized allocation becomes 
necessary, the Board shall solicit recommendations from the Regional 
Council in the area affected.


<R05>
Sec. 100.18  Regulation adoption process.

    (a) Proposals for changes to the Federal subsistence regulations in 
subparts C or D of this part shall be accepted by the Board according to 
a published schedule. The Board may establish a rotating schedule for 
accepting proposals on various sections of subpart C or subpart D 
regulations over a period of years. The Board shall develop and publish 
proposed regulations in the Federal Register and publish notice in local 
newspapers. Comments on the proposed regulations in the form of 
proposals shall be distributed for public review.
    (1) Proposals shall be made available for at least a thirty (30) day 
review by the Regional Councils. Regional Councils shall forward their 
recommendations on proposals to the Board. Such proposals with 
recommendations may be submitted in the time period as specified by the 
Board or as a part of the Regional Council's annual report described in 
Sec. 100.11, whichever is earlier.
    (2) The Board shall publish notice throughout Alaska of the 
availability of proposals received.
    (3) The public shall have at least thirty (30) days to review and 
comment on proposals.
    (4) After the comment period the Board shall meet to receive public 
testimony and consider the proposals. The Board shall consider 
traditional use patterns when establishing harvest levels and seasons, 
and methods and means. The Board may choose not to follow any 
recommendation which the Board determines is not supported by 
substantial evidence, violates recognized principles of fish and 
wildlife conservation, or would be detrimental to the satisfaction of 
subsistence needs. If a recommendation approved by a Regional Council is 
not adopted by the Board, the Board shall set forth the factual basis 
and the reasons for its decision in writing to the Regional Council.
    (5) Following consideration of the proposals the Board shall publish 
final regulations pertaining to subparts C and D of this part in the 
Federal Register.
    (b) Proposals for changes to subparts A and B of this part shall be 
accepted by the Secretary of the Interior in accordance with 43 CFR part 
14.


<R05>
Sec. 100.19  Special actions.

    (a) The Board may restrict, close, or reopen the taking of fish and 
wildlife for non-subsistence uses on public lands when necessary to 
assure the continued viability of a particular fish or wildlife 
population, to continue subsistence uses of a fish or wildlife 
population, or for reasons of public safety or administration.
    (b) The Board may open, close, or restrict subsistence uses of a 
particular fish or wildlife population on public lands to assure the 
continued viability of a fish or wildlife population, to continue 
subsistence uses of a fish or wildlife population, or for reasons of 
public safety or administration.
    (c) The Board will accept a request for a change in seasons, methods 
and means, harvest limits and/or restrictions on harvest under this 
Sec. 100.19 only if there are extenuating circumstances necessitating a 
regulatory change before the next annual subpart D proposal cycle. 
Extenuating circumstances include unusual and significant changes in 
resource abundance or unusual conditions affecting harvest opportunities 
that could not reasonably have been anticipated and that potentially 
could have significant adverse effects on the health of fish and 
wildlife populations or subsistence uses. Requests for Special Action 
that do not meet these conditions will be rejected; however, a rejected 
Special Action request will be deferred, if appropriate, to the next 
annual regulatory proposal cycle for consideration, after coordination 
with the submitter. In general, changes to Customary and Traditional Use 
Determinations will only be considered through the annual subpart C 
proposal cycle.
    (d) In an emergency situation, the Board may immediately open, 
close, liberalize, or restrict subsistence uses of fish and wildlife on 
public lands, or

[[Page 594]]

close or restrict non-subsistence uses of fish and wildlife on public 
lands, if necessary to assure the continued viability of a fish or 
wildlife population, to continue subsistence uses of fish or wildlife, 
or for public safety reasons. Prior to implementing an emergency action, 
the Board shall consult with the State. The emergency action shall be 
effective when directed by the Board, may not exceed 60 days, and may 
not be extended unless it is determined by the Board, after notice and 
public hearing, that such action should be extended. The Board shall, in 
a timely manner, provide notice via radio announcement or personal 
contact of the emergency action and shall publish notice and reasons 
justifying the emergency action in newspapers of any area affected, and 
in the Federal Register thereafter.
    (e) After consultation with the State, the appropriate Regional 
Advisory Council(s), and adequate notice and public hearing, the Board 
may make or direct a temporary change to close, open, or adjust the 
seasons, to modify the harvest limits, or to modify the methods and 
means of harvest for subsistence uses of fish and wildlife populations 
on public lands. An affected rural resident, community, Regional 
Council, or administrative agency may request a temporary change in 
seasons, harvest limits, or methods or means of harvest. In addition, a 
temporary change may be made only after the Board determines that the 
proposed temporary change will not interfere with the conservation of 
healthy fish and wildlife populations, will not be detrimental to the 
long-term subsistence use of fish or wildlife resources, and is not an 
unnecessary restriction on non-subsistence users. The decision of the 
Board shall be the final administrative action. The temporary change 
shall be effective when directed by the Board following notice in the 
affected area(s). This notice may include publication in newspapers or 
announcement on local radio stations. The Board shall publish notice and 
reasons justifying the temporary action in the Federal Register 
thereafter. The length of any temporary change shall be confined to the 
minimum time period or harvest limit determined by the Board to be 
necessary to satisfy subsistence uses. A temporary opening or closure 
will not extend beyond the regulatory year for which it is promulgated.
    (f) Regulations authorizing any individual agency to direct 
temporary or emergency closures on public lands managed by the agency 
remain unaffected by the regulations in this part, which authorize the 
Board to make or direct restrictions, closures, or temporary changes for 
subsistence uses on public lands.
    (g) You may not take fish and wildlife in violation of a 
restriction, closure, opening, or temporary change authorized by the 
Board.


<R05>
Sec. 100.20  Request for reconsideration.

    (a) Regulations in subparts C and D of this part published in the 
Federal Register are subject to requests for reconsideration.
    (b) Any aggrieved person may file a request for reconsideration with 
the Board.
    (c) To file a request for reconsideration, you must notify the Board 
in writing within sixty (60) days of the effective date or date of 
publication of the notice, whichever is earlier, for which 
reconsideration is requested.
    (d) It is your responsibility to provide the Board with sufficient 
narrative evidence and argument to show why the action by the Board 
should be reconsidered. The Board will accept a request for 
reconsideration only if it is based upon information not previously 
considered by the Board, demonstrates that the existing information used 
by the Board is incorrect, or demonstrates that the Board's 
interpretation of information, applicable law, or regulation is in error 
or contrary to existing law. You must include the following information 
in your request for reconsideration:
    (1) Your name, and mailing address;
    (2) The action which you request be reconsidered and the date of 
Federal Register publication of that action;
    (3) A detailed statement of how you are adversely affected by the 
action;
    (4) A detailed statement of the facts of the dispute, the issues 
raised by the request, and specific references to any

[[Page 595]]

law, regulation, or policy that you believe to be violated and your 
reason for such allegation;
    (5) A statement of how you would like the action changed.
    (e) Upon receipt of a request for reconsideration, the Board shall 
transmit a copy of such request to any appropriate Regional Council and 
the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADFG) for review and 
recommendation. The Board shall consider any Regional Council and ADFG 
recommendations in making a final decision.
    (f) If the request is justified, the Board shall implement a final 
decision on a request for reconsideration after compliance with 5 U.S.C. 
551-559 (APA).
    (g) If the request is denied, the decision of the Board represents 
the final administrative action.

    Unit and Subunit mean one of the geographical areas in the State of 
Alaska known as Game Management Units, or GMUs, as defined in the 
codified Alaska Department of Fish and Game regulations found in Title 5 
of the Alaska Administrative Code and collectively listed in this part 
as Units or Subunits.
    Wildlife means any hare (rabbit), ptarmigan, grouse, ungulate, bear, 
furbearer, or unclassified species and includes any part, product, egg, 
or offspring thereof, or carcass or part thereof.
    (b) Taking fish, wildlife, or shellfish for subsistence uses by a 
prohibited method is a violation of this part. Seasons are closed unless 
opened by Federal regulation. Hunting, trapping, or fishing during a 
closed season or in an area closed by this part is prohibited. You may 
not take for subsistence fish, wildlife, or shellfish outside 
established Unit or Area seasons, or in excess of the established Unit 
or Area harvest limits, unless otherwise provided for by the Board. You 
may take fish, wildlife, or shellfish under State regulations on public 
lands, except as otherwise restricted at Sec. Sec. 100--.26 through 
100.28. Unit/Area-specific restrictions or allowances for subsistence 
taking of fish, wildlife, or shellfish are identified at Sec. Sec. 
100.26 through 100.28.
    (c) Harvest limits. (1) Harvest limits authorized by this section 
and harvest limits established in State regulations may not be 
accumulated.
    (2) Fish, wildlife, or shellfish taken by a designated individual 
for another person pursuant to Sec. 100.10(d)(5)(ii) count toward the 
individual harvest limit of the person for whom the fish, wildlife, or 
shellfish is taken.
    (3) A harvest limit applies to the number of fish, wildlife, or 
shellfish that can be taken during a regulatory year; however, harvest 
limits for grouse, ptarmigan, and caribou (in some Units) are regulated 
by the number that may be taken per day. Harvest limits of grouse and 
ptarmigan are also regulated by the number that can be held in 
possession.
    (4) Unless otherwise provided, any person who gives or receives 
fish, wildlife, or shellfish shall furnish, upon a request made by a 
Federal or State agent, a signed statement describing the following: 
names and addresses of persons who gave and received fish, wildlife, or 
shellfish; the time and place that the fish, wildlife, or shellfish was 
taken; and identification of species transferred. Where a qualified 
subsistence user has designated another qualified subsistence user to 
take fish, wildlife, or shellfish on his or her behalf in accordance 
with Sec. 100.10(d)(5)(ii), the permit shall be furnished in place of a 
signed statement.
    (d) Fishing by designated harvest permit. (1) Any species of fish 
that may be taken by subsistence fishing under this part may be taken 
under a designated harvest permit.
    (2) If you are a Federally-qualified subsistence user, you 
(beneficiary) may designate another Federally-qualified subsistence user 
to take fish on your behalf. The designated fisherman must obtain a 
designated harvest permit prior to attempting to harvest fish and must 
return a completed harvest report. The designated fisherman may fish for 
any number of beneficiaries but may have no more than two harvest limits 
in his/her possession at any one time.
    (3) The designated fisherman must have in possession a valid 
designated fishing permit when taking, attempting to take, or 
transporting fish taken under this section, on behalf of a beneficiary.
    (4) The designated fisherman may not fish with more than one legal 
limit of gear.
    (5) You may not designate more than one person to take or attempt to 
take fish on your behalf at one time. You may not personally take or 
attempt to take fish at the same time that a designated fisherman is 
taking or attempting to take fish on your behalf.
    (e) Hunting by designated harvest permit. In Units 1-8, 9D, 10-16, 
and 18-26, if you are a Federally qualified subsistence user 
(recipient), you may designate another Federally qualified subsistence 
user to take deer, moose and caribou on your behalf unless you are a 
member of a community operating under a community harvest system or 
unless Unit-specific regulations in Section 100.26 preclude or modify 
the use

[[Page 614]]

of the designated hunter system or allow the harvest of additional 
species by a designated hunter. The designated hunter must obtain a 
designated hunter permit and must return a completed harvest report. The 
designated hunter may hunt for any number of recipients but may have no 
more than two harvest limits in his/her possession at any one time, 
unless otherwise specified in unit-specific regulations in Sec. 100.26.
    (f) A rural Alaska resident who has been designated to take fish, 
wildlife, or shellfish on behalf of another rural Alaska resident in 
accordance with Sec. 100.10(d)(5)(ii) shall promptly deliver the fish, 
wildlife, or shellfish to that rural Alaska resident and may not charge 
the recipient for his/her services in taking the fish, wildlife, or 
shellfish or claim for themselves the meat or any part of the harvested 
fish, wildlife, or shellfish.
    (g) [Reserved]
    (h) Permits. If a subsistence fishing or hunting permit is required 
by this part, the following permit conditions apply unless otherwise 
specified in this section:
    (1) You may not take more fish, wildlife, or shellfish for 
subsistence use than the limits set out in the permit;
    (2) You must obtain the permit prior to fishing or hunting;
    (3) You must have the permit in your possession and readily 
available for inspection while fishing, hunting, or transporting

records of the harvest, showing the number of fish, wildlife, or 
shellfish taken, by species, location and date of harvest, and other 
such information as may be required for management or conservation 
purposes; and
    (5) If the return of harvest information necessary for management 
and conservation purposes is required by a permit and you fail to comply 
with such reporting requirements, you are ineligible to receive a 
subsistence permit for that activity during the following calendar year, 
unless you demonstrate that failure to report was due to loss in the 
mail, accident, sickness, or other unavoidable circumstances.
    (i) You may not possess, transport, give, receive, or barter fish, 
wildlife, or shellfish that was taken in violation of Federal or State 
statutes or a regulation promulgated hereunder.

    (4) You may not intentionally waste or destroy any subsistence-
caught fish or shellfish; however, you may use for bait or other 
purposes whitefish, herring, and species for which bag limits, seasons, 
or other regulatory methods and means are not provided in this section, 
as well as the head, tail, fins, and viscera of legally taken 
subsistence fish.
    (5) Failure to salvage the edible meat may not be a violation if 
such failure is caused by circumstances beyond the control of a person, 
including theft of the harvested fish, wildlife, or shellfish, 
unanticipated weather conditions, or unavoidable loss to another animal.
    (6) If you are a Federally-qualified subsistence user, you may sell 
handicraft articles made from the skin, hide,

<R05>
Sec. 100.27  Subsistence taking of fish.

    (a) Applicability. (1) Regulations in this section apply to the 
taking of fish or their parts for subsistence uses.
    (2) You may take fish for subsistence uses at any time by any method 
unless you are restricted by the subsistence fishing regulations found 
in this section. The harvest limit specified in this section for a 
subsistence season for a species and the State harvest limit set for a 
State season for the same species are not cumulative, except as modified 
by regulations in Sec. ----.27(i). This means that if you have taken 
the harvest limit for a particular species under a subsistence season 
specified in this section, you may not, after that, take any additional 
fish of that species under any other harvest limit specified for a State 
season.
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) Methods, means, and general restrictions. (1) Unless otherwise 
specified in this section or under terms of a required subsistence 
fishing permit (as may be modified by this section), you may use the 
following legal types of gear for subsistence fishing:
    (i) A set gillnet;
    (ii) A drift gillnet;
    (iii) A purse seine;
    (iv) A hand purse seine;
    (v) A beach seine;
    (vi) Troll gear;
    (vii) A fish wheel;
    (viii) A trawl;
    (ix) A pot;
    (x) A longline;
    (xi) A fyke net;
    (xii) A lead;
    (xiii) A herring pound;
    (xiv) A dip net;
    (xv) Jigging gear;

[[Page 616]]

    (xvi) A mechanical jigging machine;
    (xvii) A handline;
    (xviii) A cast net;
    (xix) A rod and reel; and
    (xx) A spear.
    (2) You must include an escape mechanism on all pots used to take 
fish or shellfish. The escape mechanisms are as follows:
    (i) A sidewall, which may include the tunnel, of all shellfish and 
bottomfish pots must contain an opening equal to or exceeding 18 inches 
in length, except that in shrimp pots the opening must be a minimum of 6 
inches in length. The opening must be laced, sewn, or secured together 
by a single length of untreated, 100 percent cotton twine, no larger 
than 30 thread. The cotton twine may be knotted at each end only. The 
opening must be within 6 inches of the bottom of the pot and must be 
parallel with it. The cotton twine may not be tied or looped around the 
web bars. Dungeness crab pots may have the pot lid tie-down straps 
secured to the pot at one end by a single loop of untreated, 100 percent 
cotton twine no larger than 60 thread, or the pot lid must be secured so 
that, when the twine degrades, the lid will no longer be securely 
closed;
    (ii) All king crab, Tanner crab, shrimp, miscellaneous shellfish and 
bottomfish pots may, instead of complying with paragraph (c)(2)(i) of 
this section, satisfy the following: a sidewall, which may include the 
tunnel, must contain an opening at least 18 inches in length, except 
that shrimp pots must contain an opening at least 6 inches in length. 
The opening must be laced, sewn, or secured together by a single length 
of treated or untreated twine, no larger than 36 thread. A galvanic 
timed-release device, designed to release in no more than 30 days in 
saltwater, must be integral to the length of twine so that, when the 
device releases, the twine will no longer secure or obstruct the opening 
of the pot. The twine may be knotted only at each end and at the 
attachment points on the galvanic timed-release device. The opening must 
be within 6 inches of the bottom of the pot and must be parallel with 
it. The twine may not be tied or looped around the web bars.
    (3) For subsistence fishing for salmon, you may not use a gillnet 
exceeding 50 fathoms in length, unless otherwise specified in this 
section. The gillnet web must contain at least 30 filaments of equal 
diameter or at least 6 filaments, each of which must be at least 0.20 
millimeter in diameter.
    (4) Except as otherwise provided for in this section, you may not 
obstruct more than one-half the width of any stream with any gear used 
to take fish for subsistence uses.
    (5) You may not use live nonindigenous fish as bait.
    (6) You must have your first initial, last name, and address plainly 
and legibly inscribed on the side of your fish wheel facing midstream of 
the river.
    (7) You may use kegs or buoys of any color but red on any permitted 
gear, except in the following areas where kegs or buoys of any color, 
including red, may be used:
    (i) Yukon-Northern Area; and
    (ii) Kuskokwim Area.
    (8) You must have your first initial, last name, and address plainly 
and legibly inscribed on each keg, buoy, stakes attached to gillnets, 
stakes identifying gear fished under the ice, and any other unattended 
fishing gear which you use to take fish for subsistence uses.
    (9) You may not use explosives or chemicals to take fish for 
subsistence uses.
    (10) You may not take fish for subsistence uses within 300 feet of 
any dam, fish ladder, weir, culvert or other artificial obstruction, 
unless otherwise indicated.
    (11) Transactions between rural residents. Rural residents may 
exchange in customary trade subsistence-harvested fish, their parts, or 
their eggs, legally taken under the regulations in this part, for cash 
from other rural residents. The Board may recognize regional differences 
and define customary trade differently for separate regions of the 
State.
    (i) Bristol Bay Fishery Management Area--The total cash value per 
household of salmon taken within Federal jurisdiction in the Bristol Bay 
Fishery Management Area and exchanged in customary trade to rural 
residents may not exceed $500.00 annually.

[[Page 617]]

    (ii) Upper Copper River District--The total number of salmon per 
household taken within the Upper Copper River District and exchanged in 
customary trade to rural residents may not exceed 50% of the annual 
harvest of salmon by the household. No more than 50% of the annual 
household limit may be sold under paragraphs ----.27(c)(11) and (12) 
when taken together. These customary trade sales must be immediately 
recorded on a customary trade recordkeeping form. The recording 
requirement and the responsibility to ensure the household limit is not 
exceeded rests with the seller.
    (12) Transactions between a rural resident and others. In customary 
trade, a rural resident may trade fish, their parts, or their eggs, 
legally taken under the regulations in this part, for cash from 
individuals other than rural residents if the individual who purchases 
the fish, their parts, or their eggs uses them for personal or family 
consumption. If you are not a rural resident, you may not sell fish, 
their parts, or their eggs taken under the regulations in this part. The 
Board may recognize regional differences and define customary trade 
differently for separate regions of the State.
    (i) Bristol Bay Fishery Management Area--The total cash value per 
household of salmon taken within Federal jurisdiction in the Bristol Bay 
Fishery Management Area and exchanged in customary trade between rural 
residents and individuals other than rural residents may not exceed 
$400.00 annually. These customary trade sales must be immediately 
recorded on a customary trade recordkeeping form. The recording 
requirement and the responsibility to ensure the household limit is not 
exceeded rest with the seller.
    (ii) Upper Copper River District--The total cash value of salmon per 
household taken within the Upper Copper River District and exchanged in 
customary trade between rural residents and individuals other than rural 
residents may not exceed $500.00 annually. No more than 50% of the 
annual household limit may be sold under paragraphs ----.27(c)(11) and 
(12) when taken together. These customary trade sales must be 
immediately recorded on a customary trade recordkeeping form. The 
recording requirement and the responsibility to ensure the household 
limit is not exceeded rest with the seller.
    (13) No sale to, nor purchase by, fisheries businesses. (i) You may 
not sell fish, their parts, or their eggs taken under the regulations in 
this part to any individual, business, or organization required to be 
licensed as a fisheries business under Alaska Statute AS 43.75.011 
(commercial limited-entry permit or crew license holders excluded) or to 
any other business as defined under Alaska Statute 43.70.110(1) as part 
of its business transactions.
    (ii) If you are required to be licensed as a fisheries business 
under Alaska Statute AS 43.75.011 (commercial limited-entry permit or 
crew license holders excluded) or are a business as defined under Alaska 
Statute 43.70.110(1), you may not purchase, receive, or sell fish, their 
parts, or their eggs taken under the regulations in this part as part of 
your business transactions.
    (14) Except as provided elsewhere in this section, you may not take 
rainbow/steelhead trout.
    (15) You may not use fish taken for subsistence use or under 
subsistence regulations in this part as bait for commercial or sport 
fishing purposes.
    (16) [Reserved]
    (17) Unless specified otherwise in this section, you may use a rod 
and reel to take fish without a subsistence fishing permit. Harvest 
limits applicable to the use of a rod and reel to take fish for 
subsistence uses shall be as follows:
    (i) If you are required to obtain a subsistence fishing permit for 
an area, that permit is required to take fish for subsistence uses with 
rod and reel in that area. The harvest and possession limits for taking 
fish with a rod and reel in those areas are the same as indicated on the 
permit issued for subsistence fishing with other gear types;
    (ii) Except as otherwise provided for in this section, if you are 
not required to obtain a subsistence fishing permit for an area, the 
harvest and possession limits for taking fish for subsistence uses with 
a rod and reel are the same as for taking fish under State of Alaska 
subsistence fishing regulations in those same areas. If the State does 
not have a specific subsistence season and/

[[Page 618]]

or harvest limit for that particular species, the limit shall be the 
same as for taking fish under State of Alaska sport fishing regulations.
    (18) Unless restricted in this section, or unless restricted under 
the terms of a subsistence fishing permit, you may take fish for 
subsistence uses at any time.
    (19) Provisions on ADF&G subsistence fishing permits that are more 
restrictive or in conflict with the provisions contained in this section 
do not apply to Federal subsistence users.
    (20) You may not intentionally waste or destroy any subsistence-
caught fish or shellfish; however, you may use for bait or other 
purposes, whitefish, herring, and species for which harvest limits, 
seasons, or other regulatory methods and means are not provided in this 
section, as well as the head, tail, fins, and viscera of legally taken 
subsistence fish.
    (21) The taking of fish from waters within Federal jurisdiction is 
authorized outside of published open seasons or harvest limits if the 
harvested fish will be used for food in traditional or religious 
ceremonies that are part of funerary or mortuary cycles, including 
memorial potlatches, provided that:
    (i) Prior to attempting to take fish, the person (or designee) or 
Tribal Government organizing the ceremony contacts the appropriate 
Federal fisheries manager to provide the nature of the ceremony, the 
parties and/or clans involved, the species and the number of fish to be 
taken, and the Federal waters from which the harvest will occur;
    (ii) The taking does not violate recognized principles of fisheries 
conservation, and uses the methods and means allowable for the 
particular species published in the applicable Federal regulations (the 
Federal fisheries manager will establish the number, species, or place 
of taking if necessary for conservation purposes);
    (iii) Each person who takes fish under this section must, as soon as 
practical, and not more than 15 days after the harvest, submit a written 
report to the appropriate Federal fisheries manager, specifying the 
harvester's name and address, the number and species of fish taken, and 
the date and locations of the taking; and
    (iv) No permit is required for taking under this section; however, 
the harvester must be eligible to harvest the resource under Federal 
regulations.
    (d) [Reserved]
    (e) Fishing permits and reports. (1) You may take salmon only under 
the authority of a subsistence fishing permit, unless a permit is 
specifically not required in a particular area by the subsistence 
regulations in this part, or unless you are retaining salmon from your 
commercial catch consistent with paragraph (f) of this section.
    (2) The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Office of Subsistence 
Management may issue a permit to harvest fish for a qualifying cultural/
educational program to an organization that has been granted a Federal 
subsistence permit for a similar event within the previous 5 years. A 
qualifying program must have instructors, enrolled students, minimum 
attendance requirements, and standards for successful completion of the 
course. Applications must be submitted to the Office of Subsistence 
Management 60 days prior to the earliest desired date of harvest. 
Permits will be issued for no more than 25 fish per culture/education 
camp. Appeal of a rejected request can be made to the Federal 
Subsistence Board. Application for an initial permit for a qualifying 
cultural/educational program, for a permit when the circumstances have 
changed significantly, when no permit has been issued within the 
previous 5 years, or when there is a request for harvest in excess of 
that provided in this paragraph (e)(2), will be considered by the 
Federal Subsistence Board.
    (3) If a subsistence fishing permit is required by this section, the 
following permit conditions apply unless otherwise specified in this 
section:
    (i) You may not take more fish for subsistence use than the limits 
set out in the permit;
    (ii) You must obtain the permit prior to fishing;
    (iii) You must have the permit in your possession and readily 
available for inspection while fishing or transporting subsistence-taken 
fish;
    (iv) If specified on the permit, you must record, prior to leaving 
the harvest site, daily records of the catch,

[[Page 619]]

showing the number of fish taken by species, location and date of catch, 
and other such information as may be required for management or 
conservation purposes; and
    (v) If the return of catch information necessary for management and 
conservation purposes is required by a fishing permit and you fail to 
comply with such reporting requirements, you are ineligible to receive a 
subsistence permit for that activity during the following calendar year, 
unless you demonstrate that failure to report was due to loss in the 
mail, accident, sickness, or other unavoidable circumstances. You must 
also return any tags or transmitters that have been attached to fish for 
management and conservation purposes.
    (f) Relation to commercial fishing activities. (1) If you are a 
Federally-qualified subsistence user who also commercial fishes, you may 
retain fish for subsistence purposes from your lawfully-taken commercial 
catch.
    (2) When participating in a commercial and subsistence fishery at 
the same time, you may not use an amount of combined fishing gear in 
excess of that allowed under the appropriate commercial fishing 
regulations.
    (g) You may not possess, transport, give, receive, or barter 
subsistence-taken fish or their parts which have been taken contrary to 
Federal law or regulation or State law or regulation (unless superseded 
by regulations in this part).
