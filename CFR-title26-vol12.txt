                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, April 1, 2004), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in 11 separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

  Editorial Note: IRS published a document at 45 FR 6088, January 25, 
1980, deleting statutory sections from their regulations. In Chapter I 
cross references to the deleted material have been changed to the 
corresponding sections of the IRS Code of 1954 or to the appropriate 
regulations sections. When either such change produced a redundancy, the 
cross reference has been deleted. For further explanation, see 45 FR

                      TAX ON SELF-EMPLOYMENT INCOME


<R05>
Sec. 1.1401-1  Tax on self-employment income.

    (a) There is imposed, in addition to other taxes, a tax upon the 
self-employment income of every individual at the rates prescribed in 
section 1401(a) (old-age, survivors, and disability insurance) and (b) 
(hospital insurance). (See subparagraphs (1) and (2) of paragraph (b) of 
this section.) This tax shall be levied, assessed, and collected as part 
of the income tax imposed by subtitle A of the Code and, except as 
otherwise expressly provided, will be included with the tax imposed by 
section 1 or 3 in computing any deficiency or overpayment and in 
computing the interest and additions to any deficiency, overpayment, or 
tax. Since the tax on self-employment income is part of the income tax, 
it is subject to the jurisdiction of the Tax Court of the United States 
to the same extent and in the same manner as the other taxes under 
subtitle A of the Code. Furthermore, with respect to taxable years 
beginning after December 31, 1966, this tax must be taken into account 
in computing any estimate of the taxes required to be declared under 
section 6015.
    (b) The rates of tax on self-employment income are as follows:
    (1) For old-age, survivors, and disability insurance:

    (c) In general, self-employment income consists of the net earnings 
derived by an individual (other than a nonresident alien) from a trade 
or business carried on by him as sole proprietor or by a partnership of 
which he is a member, including the net earnings of certain employees as 
set forth in Sec. 1.1402(c)-3, and of crew leaders, as defined in 
section 3121(o) (see such section and the regulations thereunder in part 
31 of this chapter (Employment Tax Regulations)). See, however, the 
exclusions, exceptions, and limitations set forth in Sec. Sec. 
1.1402(a)-1 through 1.1402(h)-1.

44445, Dec. 24, 1974]


<R05>
Sec. 1.1402(a)-1  Definition of net earnings from self-employment.

    (a) Subject to the special rules set forth in Sec. Sec. 1.1402(a)-3 
to 1.1402(a)-17, inclusive, and to the exclusions set forth in 
Sec. Sec. 1.1402(c)-2 to 1.1402(c)-7, inclusive, the term ``net 
earnings from self-employment'' means:
    (1) The gross income derived by an individual from any trade or 
business carried on by such individual, less the deductions allowed by 
chapter 1 of the Code which are attributable to such trade or business, 
plus
    (2) His distributive share (whether or not distributed), as 
determined under section 704, of the income (or minus the loss), 
described in section 702(a)(9) and as computed under section 703, from 
any trade or business carried on by any partnership of which he is a 
member.
    (b) Gross income derived by an individual from a trade or business 
includes payments received by him from a partnership of which he is a 
member for services rendered to the partnership or for the use of 
capital by the partnership, to the extent the payments are determined 
without regard to the income of the partnership. However, such payments 
received from a partnership not engaged in a trade or business within 
the meaning of section 1402(c) and Sec. 1.1402(c)-1 do not constitute 
gross income derived by an individual from a trade or business. See 
section 707(c) and the regulations thereunder, relating to guaranteed 
payments to a member of a partnership for services or the use of 
capital. See also section 706(a) and the regulations thereunder, 
relating to the taxable year of the partner in which such guaranteed 
payments are to be included in computing taxable income.
    (c) Gross income derived by an individual from a trade or business 
includes gross income received (in the case of an individual reporting 
income on the cash receipts and disbursements method) or accrued (in the 
case of an individual reporting income on the accrual method) in the 
taxable year from a trade or business even though such income may be 
attributable in whole or in part to services rendered or other acts 
performed in a prior taxable year as to which the individual was not 
subject to the tax on self-employment income.

[T.D. 6691, 28 FR 12796, Dec. 3, 1963, as amended by T.D. 7333, 39 FR 
44445, Dec. 24, 1974]


<R05>
Sec. 1.1402(a)-2  Computation of net earnings from self-employment.

    (a) General rule. In general, the gross income and deductions of an 
individual attributable to a trade or business (including a trade or 
business conducted by an employee referred to in paragraphs (b), (c), 
(d), or (e) of Sec. 1.1402(c)-3), for the purpose of ascertaining his 
net earnings from self-employment, are to be determined by reference to 
the provisions of law and regulations applicable with respect to the 
taxes imposed by sections 1 and 3. Thus, if an individual uses the 
accrual method of accounting in computing taxable income from a trade or 
business for the purpose of the tax imposed by section 1 or 3, he must 
use the same method in determining net earnings from self-employment. 
Likewise, if a taxpayer engaged in a trade or business of selling

[[Page 11]]

property on the installment plan elects, under the provisions of section 
453, to use the installment method in computing income for purposes of 
the tax under section 1 or 3, he must use the same method in determining 
net earnings from self-employment. Income which is excludable from gross 
income under any provision of subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code is 
not taken into account in determining net earnings from self-employment 
except as otherwise provided in Sec. 1.1402(a)-9, relating to certain 
residents of Puerto Rico, in Sec. 1.1402(a)-11, relating to ministers 
or members of religious orders, and in Sec. 1.1402(a)-12, relating to 
the term ``possession of the United States'' as used for purposes of the 
tax on self-employment income. Thus, in the case of a citizen of the 
United States conducting, in a foreign country, a trade or business in 
which both personal services and capital are material income-producing 
factors, any part of the income therefrom which is excluded from gross 
income as earned income under the provisions of section 911 and the 
regulations thereunder is not taken into account in determining net 
earnings from self-employment.
    (b) Trade or business carried on. The trade or business must be 
carried on by the individual, either personally or through agents or 
employees. Accordingly, income derived from a trade or business carried 
on by an estate or trust is not included in determining the net earnings 
from self-employment of the individual beneficiaries of such estate or 
trust.
    (c) Aggregate net earnings. Where an individual is engaged in more 
than one trade or business within the meaning of section 1402(c) and 
Sec. 1.1402(c)-1, his net earnings from self-employment consist of the 
aggregate of the net income and losses (computed subject to the special 
rules provided in Sec. Sec. 1.1402(a)-1 to 1.1402(a)-17 inclusive) of 
all such trades or businesses carried on by him. Thus, a loss sustained 
in one trade or business carried on by an individual will operate to 
offset the income derived by him from another trade or business.
    (d) Partnerships. The net earnings from self-employment of an 
individual include, in addition to the earnings from a trade or business 
carried on by him, his distributive share of the income or loss, 
described in section 702(a)(9), from any trade or business carried on by 
each partnership of which he is a member. An individual's distributive 
share of such income or loss of a partnership shall be determined as 
provided in section 704, subject to the special rules set forth in 
section 1402(a) and in Sec. Sec. 1.1402(a)-1 to 1.1402(a)-17, 
inclusive, and to the exclusions provided in section 1402(c) and 
Sec. Sec. 1.1402(c)-2 to 1.1402(c)-7, inclusive. For provisions 
relating to the computation of the taxable income of a partnership, see 
section 703.
    (e) Different taxable years. If the taxable year of a partner 
differs from that of the partnership, the partner shall include, in 
computing net earnings from self-employment, his distributive share of 
the income or loss, described in section 702(a)(9), of the partnership 
for its taxable year ending with or within the taxable year of the 
partner. For the special rule in case of the termination of a partner's 
taxable year as result of death, see Sec. Sec. 1.1402(f) and 1.1402(f)-
1.
    (f) Meaning of partnerships. For the purpose of determining net 
earnings from self-employment, a partnership is one which is recognized 
as such for income tax purposes. For income tax purposes, the term 
``partnership'' includes not only a partnership as known at common law, 
but, also a syndicate, group, pool, joint venture, or other 
unincorporated organization which carries on any trade or business, 
financial operation, or venture, and which is not, within the meaning of 
the Code, a trust, estate, or a corporation. An organization described 
in the preceding sentence shall be treated as a partnership for purposes 
of the tax on self-employment income even though such organization has 
elected, pursuant to section 1361 and the regulations thereunder, to be 
taxed as a domestic corporation.
    (g) Nature of partnership interest. The net earnings from self-
employment of a partner include his distributive share of the income or 
loss, described in section 702(a)(9), of the partnership of which he is 
a member, irrespective of the nature of his membership. Thus, in 
determining his net earnings from self-

[[Page 12]]

employment, a limited or inactive partner includes his distributive 
share of such partnership income or loss. In the case of a partner who 
is a member of a partnership with respect to which an election has been 
made pursuant to section 1361 and the regulations thereunder to be taxed 
as a domestic corporation, net earnings from self-employment include his 
distributive share of the income or loss, described in section 
702(a)(9), from the trade or business carried on by the partnership 
computed without regard to the fact that the partnership has elected to 
be taxed as a domestic corporation.
    (h) Proprietorship taxed as domestic corporation. A proprietor of an 
unincorporated business enterprise with respect to which an election has 
been made pursuant to section 1361 and the regulations thereunder to be 
taxed as a domestic corporation shall compute his net earnings from 
self-employment without regard to the fact that such election has been 
made.

Sec. 1.1402(a)-3  Special rules for computing net earnings from self-employment.

    For the purpose of computing net earnings from self-employment, the 
gross income derived by an individual from a trade or business carried 
on by him, the allowable deductions attributable to such trade or 
business, and the individual's distributive share of the income or loss, 
described in section 702(a)(9), from any trade or business carrier on by 
a partnership of which he is a member shall be computed in accordance 
with the special rules set forth in Sec. Sec. 1.1402(a)-4 to 1.1402(a)-
17, inclusive.

[T.D. 7333, 39 FR 44445, Dec. 24, 1974]


<R05>
Sec. 1.1402(a)-4  Rentals from real estate.

    (a) In general. Rentals from real estate and from personal property 
leased with the real estate (including such rentals paid in crop shares) 
and the deductions attributable thereto, unless such rentals are 
received by an individual in the course of a trade or business as a 
real-estate dealer, are excluded. Whether or not an individual is 
engaged in the trade or business of a real-estate dealer is determined 
by the application of the principles followed in respect of the taxes 
imposed by sections 1 and 3. In general, an individual who is engaged in 
the business of selling real estate to customers with a view to the 
gains and profits that may be derived from such sales is a real-estate 
dealer. On the other hand, an individual who merely holds real estate 
for investment or speculation and receives rentals therefrom is not 
considered a real-estate dealer. Where a real-estate dealer holds real 
estate for investment or speculation in addition to real estate held for 
sale to customers in the ordinary course of his trade or business as a 
real-estate dealer, only the rentals from the real estate held for sale 
to customers in the ordinary course of his trade or business as a real-
estate dealer, and the deductions attributable thereto, are included in 
determining net earnings from self-employment; the rentals from the real 
estate held for investment or speculation, and the deductions 
attributable thereto, are excluded. Rentals paid in crop shares include 
income derived by an owner or lessee of land under an agreement entered 
into with another person pursuant to which such other person undertakes 
to produce a crop or livestock on such land and pursuant to which (1) 
the crop or livestock, or the proceeds thereof, are to be divided 
between such owner or lessee and such other person, and (2) the share of 
the owner or lessee depends on the amount of the crop or livestock 
produced. See, however, paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) Special rule for ``includible farm rental income''--(1) In 
general. Notwithstanding the rules set forth in paragraph (a) of this 
section, there shall be included in determining net earnings from self-
employment for taxable years ending after 1955 any income derived by an 
owner or tenant of land, if the following requirements are met with 
respect to such income:
    (i) The income is derived under an arrangement between the owner or 
tenant of land and another person which provides that such other person 
shall produce agricultural or horticultural commodities on such land, 
and that there shall be material participation

[[Page 13]]

by the owner or tenant in the production or the management of the 
production of such agricultural or horticultural commodities; and
    (ii) There is material participation by the owner or tenant with 
respect to any such agricultural or horticultural commodity.

Income so derived shall be referred to in this section as ``includible 
farm rental income''.
    (2) Requirement that income be derived under an arrangement. In 
order for rental income received by an owner or tenant of land to be 
treated as includible farm rental income, such income must be derived 
pursuant to a share-farming or other rental arrangement which 
contemplates material participation by the owner or tenant in the 
production or management of production of agricultural or horticultural 
commodities.
    (3) Nature of arrangement. (i) The arrangement between the owner or 
tenant and the person referred to in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph 
may be either oral or written. The arrangement must impose upon such 
other person the obligation to produce one or more agricultural or 
horticultural commodities (including livestock, bees, poultry, and fur-
bearing animals and wildlife) on the land of the owner or tenant. In 
addition, it must be within the contemplation of the parties that the 
owner or tenant will participate in the production or the management of 
the production of the agricultural or horticultural commodities required 
to be produced by the other person under such arrangement to an extent 
which is material with respect either to the production or to the 
management of production of such commodities or is material with respect 
to the production and management of production when the total required 
participation in connection with both is considered.
    (ii) The term ``production'', wherever used in this paragraph, 
refers to the physical work performed and the expenses incurred in 
producing a commodity. It includes such activities as the actual work of 
planting, cultivating, and harvesting crops, and the furnishing of 
machinery, implements, seed, and livestock. An arrangement will be 
treated as contemplating that the owner or tenant will materially 
participate in the ``production'' of the commodities required to be 
produced by the other person under the arrangement if under the 
arrangement it is understood that the owner or tenant is to engage to a 
material degree in the physical work related to the production of such 
commodities. The mere undertaking to furnish machinery, implements, and 
livestock and to incur expenses is not, in and of itself, sufficient. 
Such factors may be significant, however, in cases where the degree of 
physical work intended of the owner or tenant is not material. For 
example, if under the arrangement it is understood that the owner or 
tenant is to engage periodically in physical work to a degree which is 
not material in and of itself and, in addition, to furnish a substantial 
portion of the machinery, implements, and livestock to be used in the 
production of the commodities or to furnish or advance funds or assume 
financial responsibility for a substantial part of the expense involved 
in the production of the commodities, the arrangement will be treated as 
contemplating material participation of the owner or tenant in the 
production of such commodities.
    (iii) The term ``management of the production'', wherever used in 
this paragraph, refers to services performed in making managerial 
decisions relating to the production, such as when to plant, cultivate, 
dust, spray, or harvest the crop, and includes advising and consulting, 
making inspections, and making decisions as to matters such as rotation 
of crops, the type of crops to be grown, the type of livestock to be 
raised, and the type of machinery and implements to be furnished. An 
arrangement will be treated as contemplating that the owner or tenant is 
to participate materially in the ``management of the production'' of the 
commodities required to be produced by the other person under the 
arrangement if the owner or tenant is to engage to a material degree in 
the management decisions related to the production of such commodities. 
The services which are considered of particular importance in making 
such management decisions are those services performed in making 
inspections of the production activities and in advising

[[Page 14]]

and consulting with such person as to the production of the commodities. 
Thus, if under the arrangement it is understood that the owner or tenant 
is to advise or consult periodically with the other person as to the 
production of the commodities required to be produced by such person 
under the arrangement and to inspect periodically the production 
activities on the land, a strong inference will be drawn that the 
arrangement contemplates participation by the owner or tenant in the 
management of the production of such commodities. The mere undertaking 
to select the crops or livestock to be produced or the type of machinery 
and implements to be furnished or to make decisions as to the rotation 
of crops generally is not, in and of itself, sufficient. Such factors 
may be significant, however, in making the overall determination of 
whether the arrangement contemplates that the owner or tenant is to 
participate materially in the management of the production of the 
commodities. Thus, if in addition to the understanding that the owner or 
tenant is to advise or consult periodically with the other person as to 
the production of the commodities and to inspect periodically the 
production activities on the land, it is also understood that the owner 
is to select the type of crops and livestock to be produced and the type 
of machinery and implements to be furnished and to make decisions as to 
the rotation of crops, the arrangement will be treated as contemplating 
material participation of the owner or tenant in the management of 
production of such commodities.
    (4) Actual participation. In order for the rental income received by 
the owner or tenant of land to be treated as includible farm rental 
income, not only must it be derived pursuant to the arrangement 
described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, but also the owner or 
tenant must actually participate to a material degree in the production 
or in the management of the production of any of the commodities 
required to be produced under the arrangement, or he must actually 
participate in both the production and the management of the production 
to an extent that his participation in the one when combined with his 
participation in the other will be considered participation to a 
material degree. If the owner or tenant shows that he periodically 
advises or consults with the other person, who under the arrangement 
produces the agricultural or horticultural commodities, as to the 
production of any of these commodities and also shows that he 
periodically inspects the production activities on the land, he will 
have presented strong evidence of the existence of the degree of 
participation contemplated by section 1402(a)(1). If, in addition to the 
foregoing, the owner or tenant shows that he furnishes a substantial 
portion of the machinery, implements, and livestock used in the 
production of the commodities or that he furnishes or advances funds, or 
assumes financial responsibility, for a substantial part of the expense 
involved in the production of the commodities, he will have established 
the existence of the degree of participation contemplated by section 
1402(a)(1) and this paragraph.
    (5) Employees or agents. An agreement entered into by an employee or 
agent of an owner or tenant and another person is considered to be an 
arrangement entered into by the owner or tenant for purposes of 
satisfying the requirement set forth in paragraph (b)(2) that the income 
must be derived under an arrangement between the owner or tenant and 
another person. For purposes of determining whether the arrangement 
satisfies the requirement set forth in paragraph (b)(3) that the parties 
contemplate that the owner or tenant will materially participate in the 
production or management of production of a commodity, services which 
will be performed by an employee or agent of the owner or tenant are not 
considered to be services which the arrangement contemplates will be 
performed by the owner or tenant. Services actually performed by such 
employee or agent are not considered services performed by the owner or 
tenant in determining the extent to which the owner or tenant has 
participated in the production or management of production of a 
commodity. For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1974, 
contemplated or actual services of an agent or an employee of the owner 
or

[[Page 15]]

tenant are deemed to be contemplated or actual services of the owner or 
tenant under paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section.
    (6) Examples. Application of the rules prescribed in this paragraph 
may be illustrated by the following examples:

    Example (1). After the death of her husband, Mrs. A rents her farm, 
together with its machinery and equipment, to B for one-half of the 
proceeds from the commodities produced on such farm by B. It is agreed 
that B will live in the tenant house on the farm and be responsible for 
the over-all operation of the farm, such as planting, cultivating, and 
harvesting the field crops, caring for the orchard and harvesting the 
fruit and caring for the livestock and poultry. It also is agreed that 
Mrs. A will continue to live in the farm residence and help B operate 
the farm. Under the agreement it is contemplated that Mrs. A will 
regularly operate and clean the cream separator and feed the poultry 
flock and collect the eggs. When possible she will assist B in such work 
as spraying the fruit trees, penning livestock, culling the poultry, and 
controlling weeds. She will also assist in preparing the meals when B 
engages seasonal workers. The agreement between Mrs. A and B clearly 
provides that she will materially participate in the over-all production 
operations to be conducted on her farm by B. In actual practice, Mrs. A 
performs such regular and intermittent services. The regularly performed 
services are material to the production of an agricultural commodity, 
and the intermittent services performed are material to the production 
operations to which they relate. The furnishing of a substantial portion 
of the farm machinery and equipment also adds support to a conclusion 
that Mrs. A has materially participated. Accordingly, the rental income 
Mrs. A receives from her farm should be included in net earnings from 
self-employment.
    Example (2). D agrees to produce a crop on C's cotton farm under an 
arrangement providing that C and D will each receive one-half of the 
proceeds from such production. C agrees to furnish all the necessary 
equipment, and it is understood that he is to advise D when to plant the 
cotton and when it needs to be chopped, plowed, sprayed, and picked. It 
is also understood that during the growing season C is to inspect the 
crop every few days to determine whether D is properly taking care of 
the crop. Under the arrangement, D is required to furnish all labor 
needed to grow and harvest the crop. C, in fact, renders such advice, 
makes such inspections, and furnishes such equipment. C's contemplated 
participation in management decisions is considered material with 
respect to the management of the cotton production operation. C's actual 
participation pursuant to the arrangement is also considered to be 
material with respect to the management of the production of cotton. 
Accordingly, the income C receives from his cotton farm is to be 
included in computing his net earnings from self-employment.
    Example (3). E owns a grain farm and turns its operation over to his 
son, F. By the oral rental arrangement between E and F, the latter 
agrees to produce crops of grain on the farm, and E agrees that he will 
be available for consultation and advice and will inspect and help to 
harvest the crops. E furnishes most of the equipment, including a 
tractor, a combine, plows, wagons, drills, and harrows; he continues to 
live on the farm and does some of the work such as repairing barns and 
farm machinery, going to town for supplies, cutting weeds, etc.; he 
regularly inspects the crops during the growing season; and he helps F 
to harvest the crops. Although the final decisions are made by F, he 
frequently consults with his father regarding the production of the 
crops. An evaluation of all of E's actual activities indicates that they 
are sufficiently substantial and regular to support a conclusion that he 
is materially participating in the crop production operations and the 
management thereof. If it can be shown that the degree of E's actual 
participation was contemplated by the arrangement, E's income from the 
grain farm will be included in computing net earnings from self-
employment.
    Example (4). G owns a fully-equipped farm which he rents to H under 
an arrangement which contemplates that G shall materially participate in 
the management of the production of crops raised on the farm pursuant to 
the arrangement. G lives in town about 5 miles from the farm. About 
twice a month he visits the farm and looks over the buildings and 
equipment. G may occasionally, in an emergency, discuss with H some 
phase of a crop production activity. In effect, H has complete charge of 
the management of farming operations regardless of the understanding 
between him and G. Although G pays one-half of the cost of the seed and 
fertilizer and is charged for the cost of materials purchased by H to 
make all necessary repairs, G's activities do not constitute material 
participation in the crop production activities. Accordingly, G's income 
from the crops is not included in computing net earnings from self-
employment.
    Example (5). I owned a farm several miles from the town in which he 
lived. He rented the farm to J under an arrangement which contemplated 
I's material participation in the management of production of wheat. I 
furnished one-half of the seed and fertilizer and all the farm equipment 
and livestock. He

[[Page 16]]

employed K to perform all the services in advising, consulting, and 
inspecting contemplated by the arrangement. I is not materially 
participating in the management of production of wheat by J. The work 
done by I's employee, K, is not attributable to I in determining the 
extent of I's participation. I's rental income from the arrangement is, 
therefore, not to be included in computing his net earnings from self-
employment. For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1974, however, 
I's rental income would be includible in those earnings.
    Example (6). L, a calendar-year taxpayer, appointed M as his agent 
to rent his fully equipped farm for 1974. M entered into a rental 
arrangement with N under which M was to direct the planting of crops, 
inspect them weekly during the growing season, and consult with N on any 
problems that might arise in connection with irrigation, etc., while N 
furnished all the labor needed to grow and harvest the crops. M did in 
fact fulfill its responsibilities under the arrangement. Although the 
arrangement entered into by M and N is considered to have been made by 
L, M's services are not attributable to L, and L's furnishing of a fully 
equipped farm is insufficient by itself to constitute material 
participation in the production of the crops. Accordingly, L's rental 
income from the arrangement is not included in his net earnings from 
self-employment for that year. For taxable years beginning before 
January 1, 1974, however, L's rental income would be includible in those 
earnings.

    (c) Rentals from living quarters--(1) No services rendered for 
occupants. Payments for the use or occupancy of entire private 
residences or living quarters in duplex or multiple-housing units are 
generally rentals from real estate. Except in the case of real-estate 
dealers, such payments are excluded in determining net earnings from 
self-employment even though such payments are in part attributable to 
personal property furnished under the lease.
    (2) Services rendered for occupants. Payments for the use or 
occupancy of rooms or other space where services are also rendered to 
the occupant, such as for the use or occupancy of rooms or other 
quarters in hotels, boarding houses, or apartment houses furnishing 
hotel services, or in tourist camps or tourist homes, or payments for 
the use or occupancy of space in parking lots, warehouses, or storage 
garages, do not constitute rentals from real estate; consequently, such 
payments are included in determining net earnings from self-employment. 
Generally, services are considered rendered to the occupant if they are 
primarily for his convenience and are other than those usually or 
customarily rendered in connection with the rental of rooms or other 
space for occupancy only. The supplying of maid service, for example, 
constitutes such service; whereas the furnishing of heat and light, the 
cleaning of public entrances, exits, stairways and lobbies, the 
collection of trash, and so forth, are not considered as services 
rendered to the occupant.
    (3) Example. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by 
the following example:

    Example. A, an individual, owns a building containing four 
apartments. During the taxable year, he receives $1,400 from apartments 
numbered 1 and 2, which are rented without services rendered to the 
occupants, and $3,600 from apartments numbered 3 and 4, which are rented 
with services rendered to the occupants. His fixed expenses for the four 
apartments aggregate $1,200 during the taxable year. In addition, he has 
$500 of expenses attributable to the services rendered to the occupants 
of apartments 3 and 4. In determining his net earnings from self-
employment, A includes the $3,600 received from apartments 3 and 4, and 
the expenses of $1,100 ($500 plus one-half of $1,200) attributable 
thereto. The rentals and expenses attributable to apartments 1 and 2 are 
excluded. Therefore, A has $2,500 of net earnings from self-employment 
for the taxable year from the building.

    (d) Treatment of business income which includes rentals from real 
estate. Except in the case of a real-estate dealer, where an individual 
or a partnership is engaged in a trade or business the income of which 
is classifiable in part as rentals from real estate, only that portion 
of such income which is not classifiable as rentals from real estate, 
and the expenses attributable to such portion, are included in 
determining net earnings from self-employment.

[T.D. 6691, 28 FR 12796, Dec. 3, 1963, as amended by T.D. 7710, 45 FR 
50739, July 31, 1980]


<R05>
Sec. 1.1402(a)-5  Dividends and interest.

    (a) All dividends on shares of stock are excluded unless they are 
received by an individual in the course of his trade or business as a 
dealer in stocks or securities.
    (b) Interest on any bond, debenture, note, or certificate, or other 
evidence

[[Page 17]]

of indebtedness, issued with interest coupons or in registered form by 
any corporation (including one issued by a government or political 
subdivision thereof) is excluded unless such interest is received in the 
course of a trade or business as a dealer in stocks or securities. 
However, interest with respect to which a credit against tax is 
allowable as provided in section 35, that is, interest on certain 
obligations of the United States and its instrumentalities, is not 
included in net earnings from self-employment even though received in 
the course of a trade or business as a dealer in stocks or securities. 
Only interest on bonds, debentures, notes, or certificates, or other 
evidence of indebtedness, issued with interest coupons or in registered 
form by a corporation, is excluded in the case of all persons other than 
dealers in stocks or securities; other interest received in the course 
of any trade or business (such as interest received by a pawnbroker on 
his loans or interest received by a merchant on his accounts or notes 
receivable) is not excluded.
    (c) Dividends and interest of the character excludable under 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section received by an individual on 
stocks or securities held for speculation or investment are excluded 
whether or not the individual is a dealer in stocks or securities.
    (d) A dealer in stocks or securities is a merchant of stocks or 
securities with an established place of business, regularly engaged in 
the business of purchasing stocks or securities and reselling them to 
customers; that is, he is one who as a merchant buys stocks or 
securities and sells them to customers with a view to the gains and 
profits that may be derived therefrom. Persons who buy and sell or hold 
stocks or securities for investment or speculation, irrespective of 
whether such buying or selling constitutes the carrying on of a trade or 
business, are not dealers in stocks or securities.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1402(a)-6  Gain or loss from disposition of property.

    (a) There is excluded any gain or loss: (1) Which is considered as 
gain or loss from the sale or exchange of a capital asset; (2) from the 
cutting of timber or the disposal of timber, coal, or iron ore, even 
though held primarily for sale to customers, if section 631 is 
applicable to such gain or loss; and (3) from the sale, exchange, 
involuntary conversion, or other disposition of property if such 
property is neither (i) stock in trade or other property of a kind which 
would properly be includible in inventory if on hand at the close of the 
taxable year, nor (ii) property held primarily for sale to customers in 
the ordinary course of a trade or business. For the purpose of the 
special rule in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, it is immaterial 
whether a gain or loss is treated as a capital gain or loss or as an 
ordinary gain or loss for purposes other than determining net earnings 
from self-employment. For instance, where the character of a loss is 
governed by the provisions of section 1231, such loss is excluded in 
determining net earnings from self-employment even though such loss is 
treated under section 1231 as an ordinary loss. For the purposes of this 
special rule, the term ``involuntary conversion'' means a compulsory or 
involuntary conversion of property into other property or money as a 
result of its destruction in whole or in part, theft or seizure, or an 
exercise of the power of requisition or condemnation or the threat or 
imminence thereof; and the term ``other dispostion'' includes the 
destruction or loss, in whole or in part, of property by fire, storm, 
shipwreck, or other casualty, or by theft, even though there is no 
conversion of such property into other property or money.
    (b) The application of this section may be illustrated by the 
following example:

    Example. During the taxable year 1954, A, who owns a grocery store, 
realized a net profit of $1,500 from the sale of groceries and a gain of 
$350 from the sale of a refrigerator case. During the same year, he 
sustained a loss of $2,000 as a result of damage by fire to the store 
building. In computing taxable income, all of these items are taken into 
account. In determining net earnings from self-employment, however, only 
the $1,500 of profit derived from the sale of groceries is included. The 
$350 gain and the $2,000 loss are excluded.

[T.D. 6691, 28 FR 12796, Dec. 3, 1963, as amended by T.D. 6841, 30 FR 
9309, July 27, 1965]

[[Page 18]]


<R05>
Sec. 1.1402(a)-7  Net operating loss deduction.

    The deduction provided by section 172, relating to net operating 
losses sustained in years other than the taxable year, is excluded.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1402(a)-8  Community income.

    (a) In case of an individual. If any of the income derived by an 
individual from a trade or business (other than a trade or business 
carried on by a partnership) is community income under community 
property laws applicable to such income, all of the gross income, and 
the deductions attributable to such income, shall be treated as the 
gross income and deductions of the husband unless the wife exercises 
substantially all of the management and control of such trade or 
business, in which case all of such gross income and deductions shall be 
treated as the gross income and deductions of the wife. For the purpose 
of this special rule, the term ``management and control'' means 
management and control in fact, not the management and control imputed 
to the husband under the community property laws. For example, a wife 
who operates a beauty parlor without any appreciable collaboration on 
the part of her husband will be considered as having substantially all 
of the management and control of such business despite the provision of 
any community property law vesting in the husband the right of 
management and control of community property; and the income and 
deductions attributable to the operation of such beauty parlor will be 
considered the income and deductions of the wife.
    (b) In case of a partnership. Even though a portion of a partner's 
distributive share of the income or loss, described in section 
702(a)(9), from a trade or business carried on by a partnership is 
community income or loss under the community property laws applicable to 
such share, all of such distributive share shall be included in 
computing the net earnings from self-employment of such partner; no part 
of such share shall be taken into account in computing the net earnings 
from self-employment of the spouse of such partner. In any case in which 
both spouses are members of the same partnership, the distributive share 
of the income or loss of each spouse is included in computing the net 
earnings from self-employment of that spouse.

Sec. 1.1402(a)-9  Puerto Rico.

    (a) Residents. A resident of Puerto Rico, whether or not a bona fide 
resident thereof during the entire taxable year, and whether or not an 
alien, a citizen of the United States, or a citizen of Puerto Rico, 
shall compute his net earnings from self-employment in the same manner 
as would a citizen of the United States residing in the United States. 
See paragraph (d) of Sec. 1.1402(b)-1 for regulations relating to 
nonresident aliens. For the purpose of the tax on self-employment 
income, the gross income of such a resident of Puerto Rico also includes 
income from Puerto Rican sources. Thus, under this special rule, income 
from Puerto Rican sources will be included in determining net earnings 
from self-employment of a resident of Puerto Rico engaged in the active 
conduct of a trade or business in Puerto Rico despite the fact that, 
under section 933, such income may not be taken into account for 
purposes of the tax under section 1 or 3.
    (b) Nonresidents. A citizen of Puerto Rico who is also a citizen of 
the United States and who is not a resident of Puerto Rico will compute 
his net earnings from self-employment in the same manner and subject to 
the same provisions of law and regulations as other citizens of the 
United States.

Sec. 1.1402(a)-10  Personal exemption deduction.

    The deduction provided by section 151, relating to personal 
exemptions, is excluded.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1402(a)-11  Ministers and members of religious orders.

    (a) In general. For each taxable year ending after 1954 in which a 
minister or member of a religious order is engaged in a trade or 
business, within the meaning of section 1402(c) and Sec. 1.1402(c)-5, 
with respect to service performed in the exercise of his ministry or in 
the exercise of duties required by such order, net earnings from self-
employment from such trade or business

[[Page 19]]

include the gross income derived during the taxable year from any such 
service, less the deductions attributable to such gross income. For each 
taxable year ending on or after December 31, 1957, such minister or 
member of a religious order shall compute his net earnings from self-
employment derived from the performance of such service without regard 
to the exclusions from gross income provided by section 107 (relating to 
rental value of parsonages) and section 119 (relating to meals and 
lodging furnished for the convenience of the employer). Thus, a minister 
who is subject to self-employment tax with respect to his services as a 
minister will include in the computation of his net earnings from self-
employment for a taxable year ending on or after December 31, 1957, the 
rental value of a home furnished to him as remuneration for services 
performed in the exercise of his ministry or the rental allowance paid 
to him as remuneration for such services irrespective of whether such 
rental value or rental allowance is excluded from gross income by 
section 107. Similarly, the value of any meals or lodging furnished to a 
minister or to a member of a religious order in connection with service 
performed in the exercise of his ministry or as a member of such order 
will be included in the computation of his net earnings from self-
employment for a taxable year ending on or after December 31, 1957, 
notwithstanding the exclusion of such value from gross income by section 
119.
    (b) In employ of American employer. If a minister or member of a 
religious order engaged in a trade or business described in section 
1402(c) and Sec. 1.1402(c)-5 is a citizen of the United States and 
performs service, in his capacity as a minister or member of a religious 
order, as an employee of an American employer, as defined in section 
3121(h) and the regulations thereunder in Part 31 of this chapter 
(Employment Tax Regulations), his net earnings from self-employment 
derived from such service shall be computed as provided in paragraph (a) 
of this section but without regard to the exclusions from gross income 
provided in section 911, relating to earned income from sources without 
the United States, and section 931, relating to income from sources 
within possessions of the United States. Thus, even though all the 
income of the minister or member for service of the character to which 
this paragraph is applicable was derived from sources without the United 
States, or from sources within possessions of the United States, and 
therefore may be excluded from gross income, such income is included in 
computing net earnings from self-employment.
    (c) Minister in a foreign country whose congregation is composed 
predominantly of citizens of the United States--(1) Taxable years ending 
after 1956. For any taxable year ending after 1956, a minister of a 
church, who is engaged in a trade or business within the meaning of 
section 1402(c) and Sec. 1.1402(c)-5, is a citizen of the United 
States, is performing service in the exercise of his ministry in a 
foreign country, and has a congregation composed predominantly of United 
States citizens, shall compute his net earnings from self-employment 
derived from his services as a minister for such taxable year without 
regard to the exclusion from gross income provided in section 911, 
relating to earned income from sources without the United States. For 
taxable years ending on or after December 31, 1957, such minister shall 
also disregard sections 107 and 119 in the computation of his net 
earnings from self-employment. (See paragraph (a) of this section.) For 
purposes of section 1402(a)(8) and this paragraph a ``congregation 
composed predominantly of citizens of the United States'' means a 
congregation the majority of which throughout the greater portion of its 
minister's taxable year were United States citizens.
    (2) Election for taxable years ending after 1954 and before 1957. 
(i) A minister described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph who, for 
a taxable year ending after 1954 and before 1957, had income from 
service described in such subparagraph which would have been included in 
computing net earnings from self-employment if such income had been 
derived in a taxable year ending after 1956 by an individual who had 
filed a waiver certificate under section 1402(e), may elect to have 
section 1402(a)(8) and subparagraph (1) of this paragraph apply to his 
income from

[[Page 20]]

such service for his taxable years ending after 1954 and before 1957. If 
such minister filed a waiver certificate prior to August 1, 1956, in 
accordance with Sec. 1.1402(e)(1)-1, or he files such a waiver 
certificate on or before the due date of his return (including any 
extensions thereof) for his last taxable year ending before 1957, he 
must make such election on or before the due date of his return 
(including any extensions thereof) for such taxable year or before April 
16, 1957, whichever is the later. If the waiver certificate is not so 
filed, the minister must make his election on or before the due date of 
the return (including any extensions thereof) for his first taxable year 
ending after 1956. Notwithstanding the expiration of the period 
prescribed by section 1402(e)(2) for filing such waiver, the minister 
may file a waiver certificate at the time he makes the election. In no 
event shall an election be valid unless the minister files prior to or 
at the time of the election a waiver certificate in accordance with 
Sec. 1.1402(e)(1)-1.
    (ii) The election shall be made by filing with the district director 
of internal revenue with whom the waiver certificate, Form 2031, is 
filed a written statement indicating that, by reason of the Social 
Security Amendments of 1956, the minister desires to have the Federal 
old-age, survivors, and disability insurance system established by title 
II of the Social Security Act extended to his services performed in a 
foreign country as a minister of a congregation composed predominantly 
of United States citizens beginning with the first taxable year ending 
after 1954 and prior to 1957 for which he had income from such services. 
The statement shall be dated and signed by the minister and shall 
clearly state that it is an election for retroactive self-employment tax 
coverage under the Self-Employment Contributions Act of 1954. In 
addition, the statement shall include the following information:
    (a) The name and address of the minister.
    (b) His social security account number, if he has one.
    (c) That he is a duly ordained, commissioned, or licensed minister 
of a church.
    (d) That he is a citizen of the United States.
    (e) That he is performing services in the exercise of his ministry 
in a foreign country.
    (f) That his congregation is composed predominantly of citizens of 
the United States.
    (g)(1) That he has filed a waiver certificate and, if so, where and 
under what circumstances the certificate was filed and the taxable year 
for which it is effective; or (2) that he is filing a waiver certificate 
with his election for retroactive coverage and, if so, the taxable year 
for which it is effective.
    (h) That he has or has not filed income tax returns for his taxable 
years ending after 1954 and before 1957. If he has filed such returns, 
he shall state the years for which they were filed and indicate the 
district director of internal revenue with whom they were filed.
    (iii) Notwithstanding section 1402(e)(3), a waiver certificate filed 
pursuant to Sec. 1.1402(e)(1)-1 by a minister making an election under 
this paragraph shall be effective (regardless of when such certificate 
is filed) for such minister's first taxable year ending after 1954 in 
which he had income from service described in subparagraph (1) of this 
paragraph or for the taxable year of the minister prescribed by section 
1402(e)(3), if such taxable year is earlier, and for all succeeding 
taxable years.
    (iv) No interest or penalty shall be assessed or collected for 
failure to file a return within the time prescribed by law if such 
failure arises solely by reason of an election made by a minister 
pursuant to this paragraph or for any underpayment of self-employment 
income tax arising solely by reason of such election, for the period 
ending with the date such minister makes an election pursuant to this 
paragraph.
    (d) Treatment of certain remuneration paid in 1955 and 1956 as 
wages. For treatment of remuneration paid to an individual for service 
described in section 3121(b)(8)(A) which was erroneously treated by the 
organization employing him as employment with-in the meaning of chapter 
21 of the Internal Revenue Code, see Sec. 1.1402(e)(4)-1.

Sec. 1.1402(a)-12  Possession of the United States.

    For purposes of the tax on self-employment income, the term 
``possession of the United States,'' as used in section 931 (relating to 
income from sources within possessions of the United States) and section 
932 (relating to citizens of possessions of the United States) shall be 
deemed not to include the Virgin Islands, Guam, or American Samoa. The 
provisions of section 1402(a)(9) and of this section insofar as they 
involve nonapplication of sections 931 and 932 to Guam or American 
Samoa, shall apply only in the case of taxable years beginning after 
1960. For definition of the term ``United States'' and for other 
geographical definitions relating to the Continental Shelf see section 
638 and Sec. 1.638-1.

[T.D. 7277, 38 FR 12742, May 15, 1973]


<R05>
Sec. 1.1402(a)-13  Income from agricultural activity.

    (a) Agricultural trade or business. (1) An agricultural trade or 
business is one in which, if the trade or business were carried on 
exclusively by employees, the major portion of the services would 
constitute agricultural labor as defined in section 3121(g) and the 
regulations thereunder in part 31 of this chapter (Employment Tax 
Regulations). In case the services are in part agricultural and in part 
nonagricultural, the time devoted to the performance of each type of 
service is the test to be used to determine whether the major portion of 
the services would constitute agricultural labor. If more than half of 
the time spent in performing all the services is spent in performing 
services which would constitute agricultural labor under section 
3121(g), the trade or business is agricultural. If only half, or less, 
of the time spent in performing all the services is spent in performing 
services which would constitute agricultural labor under section 
3121(g), the trade or business is not agricultural. In every case the 
time spent in performing the services will be computed by adding the 
time spent in the trade or business during the taxable year by every 
individual (including the individual carrying on such trade or business 
and the members of his family) in performing such services. The 
operation of this special rule is not affected by section 3121(c), 
relating to the included-excluded rule for determining employment.
    (2) The rules prescribed in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph have 
no application where the nonagricultural services are performed in 
connection with an enterprise which constitutes a trade or business 
separate and distinct from the trade or business conducted as an 
agricultural enterprise. Thus, the operation of a roadside automobile 
service station on farm premises constitutes a trade or business 
separate and distinct from the agricultural enterprise, and the gross 
income derived from such service station, less the deductions 
attributable thereto, is to be taken into account in determining net 
earnings from self-employment.
    (b) Farm operator's income for taxable years ending before 1955. 
Income derived in a taxable year ending before 1955 from any 
agricultural trade or business (see paragraph (a) of this section), and 
all deductions attributable to such income, are excluded in computing 
net earnings from self-employment.
    (c) Farm operator's income for taxable years ending after 1954. 
Income derived in a taxable year ending after 1954 from an agricultural 
trade or business (see paragraph (a) of this section) is includible in 
computing net earnings from self-employment. Income derived from an 
agricultural trade or business includes income derived by an individual 
under an agreement entered into by such individual with another person 
pursuant to which such individual undertakes to produce agricultural or 
horticultural commodities (including livestock, bees, poultry, and fur-
bearing animals and wildlife) on land owned or leased by such other 
person and pursuant to which the agricultural or horticultural 
commodities produced by such individual, or the proceeds therefrom, are 
to be divided between such individual and such other person, and the 
amount of such individual's share depends on the amount of the 
agricultural or horticultural commodities produced. However, except as 
provided in paragraph (d) of this section, relating to arrangements 
involving material participation, the income derived

[[Page 22]]

under such an agreement by the owner or lessee of the land is not 
includible in computing net earnings from self-employment. See Sec. 
1.1402(a)-4. For options relating to the computation of net earnings 
from self-employment, see Sec. Sec. 1.1402(a)-14 and 1.1402(a)-15.
    (d) Includible farm rental income for taxable years ending after 
1955. For taxable years ending after 1955, income derived from an 
agricultural trade or business (see paragraph (a) of this section) 
includes also income derived by the owner or tenant of land under an 
arrangement between such owner or tenant and another person, if such 
arrangement provides that such other person shall produce agricultural 
or horticultural commodities (including livestock, bees, poultry, and 
fur-bearing animals and wildlife) on such land, and that there shall be 
material participation by the owner or tenant in the production or the 
management of the production of such agricultural or horticultural 
commodities, and if there is material participation by the owner or 
tenant with respect to any such agricultural or horticultural commodity. 
See paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.1402(a)-4. For options relating to the 
computation of net earnings from self-employment, see Sec. Sec. 
1.1402(a)-14 and 1.1402(a)-15.
    (e) Income from service performed after 1956 as a crew leader. 
Income derived by a crew leader (see section 3121(o) and the regulations 
thereunder in Part 31 of this chapter (Employment Tax Regulations)) from 
service performed after 1956 in furnishing individuals to perform 
agricultural labor for another person and from service performed after 
1956 in agricultural labor as a member of the crew is considered to be 
income derived from a trade or business for purposes of Sec. 1.1402(c)-
1. Whether such trade or business is an agricultural trade or business 
shall be determined by applying the rules set forth in this section.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1402(a)-14  Options available to farmers in computing net 

earnings from self-employment for taxable years ending after 1954 
and before December 31, 1956.

    (a) Computation of net earnings. In the case of any trade or 
business which is carried on by an individual who reports his income on 
the cash receipts and disbursements method, and in which, if it were 
carried on exclusively by employees, the major portion of the services 
would constitute agricultural labor as defined in section 3121(g) (see 
paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.1402(a)-13), net earnings from self-employment 
may, for a taxable year ending after 1954, at the option of the 
taxpayer, be computed as follows:
    (1) Gross income $1,800 or less. If the gross income, computed as 
provided in paragraph (b) of this section, from such trade or business 
is $1,800 or less, the taxpayer may, at his option, treat as net 
earnings from self-employment from such trade or business an amount 
equal to 50 percent of such gross income. If the taxpayer so elects, the 
amount equal to 50 percent of such gross income shall be used in 
computing his self-employment income in lieu of his actual net earnings 
from such trade or business, if any.
    (2) Gross income in excess of $1,800. If the gross income, computed 
as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, from such trade or 
business is more than $1,800, and the actual net earnings from self-
employment from such trade or business are less than $900, the taxpayer 
may, at his option, treat $900 as net earnings from self-employment. If 
the taxpayer so elects, $900 shall be used in computing his self-
employment income in lieu of his actual net earnings from such trade or 
business, if any. However, if the taxpayer's actual net earnings from 
such trade or business, as computed in accordance with Sec. Sec. 
1.1402(a)-1 through 1.1402(a)-3 are $900 or more, such actual net 
earnings shall be used in computing his self-employment income.
    (b) Computation of gross income. For purposes of paragraph (a) of 
this section, gross income shall consist of the gross receipts from such 
trade or business reduced by the cost or other basis of property which 
was purchased and sold in carrying on such trade or business, adjusted 
(after such reduction) in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 
1.1402(a)-3, relating to income and deductions not included in computing 
net earnings from self-employment.
    (c) Two or more agricultural activities. If an individual is engaged 
in more than one agricultural trade or business

[[Page 23]]

within the meaning of paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.1402(a)-13 (for example, 
the business of ordinary farming and the business of cotton ginning), 
the gross income derived from each agricultural trade or business shall 
be aggregated for purposes of the optional method provided in paragraph 
(a) of this section for computing net earnings from self-employment.
    (d) Examples. Application of the regulations prescribed in 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section may be illustrated by the 
following examples:

    Example (1). F, a farmer, uses the cash receipts and disbursements 
method of accounting in making his income tax returns. F's books and 
records show that during the calendar year 1955 he received $1,200 from 
the sale of produce raised on the farm, $200 from the sale of livestock 
raised on the farm and not held for breeding or dairy purposes, and $600 
from the sale of a tractor. The income from the sale of the tractor is 
of a type which is excluded from net earnings from self-employment by 
section 1402(a). F's actual net earnings from self-employment, computed 
in accordance with the provisions of Sec. Sec. 1.1402(a)-1 through 
1.1402(a)-3, are $450. F may report $450 as his net earnings from self-
employment or he may elect to report $700 (one-half of $1,400).
    Example (2). C, a cattleman, uses the cash receipts and 
disbursements method of accounting in making his income tax returns. C 
had actual net earnings from self-employment, computed in accordance 
with the provisions of Sec. Sec. 1.1402(a)-1 through 1.1402(a)-3, of 
$725. His gross receipts were $1,000 from the sale of produce raised on 
the farm and $1,200 from the sale of feeder cattle, which C bought for 
$500. The income from the sale of the feeder cattle is of a type which 
is included in computing net earnings from self-employment. Therefore, C 
may report $725 as his net earnings from self-employment or he may elect 
to report $850, one-half of $1,700 ($2,200 minus $500).
    Example (3). R, a rancher, has gross income of $3,000 from the 
operation of his ranch, computed as provided in paragraph (b) of this 
section. His actual net earnings from self-employment from farming 
activities are less than $900. R, nevertheless, may elect to report $900 
as net earnings from self-employment from such trade or business. If R 
had actual net earnings from self-employment from his farming activities 
in the amount of $900 or more, he would be required to report such 
amount in computing his self-employment income.

    (e) Members of farm partnerships. The optional method provided by 
paragraph (a) of this section for computing net earnings from self-
employment is not available to a member of a partnership with respect to 
his distributive share of the income or loss from any trade or business 
carried on by any partnership of which he is a member.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1402(a)-15  Options available to farmers in computing net earnings 
from self-employment for taxable years ending on or after December 31, 1956.

    (a) Computation of net earnings. In the case of any trade or 
business which is carried on by an individual or by a partnership and in 
which, if such trade or business were carried on exclusively by 
employees, the major portion of the services would constitute 
agricultural labor as defined in section 3121(g) (see paragraph (a) of 
Sec. 1.1402(a)-13), net earnings from self-employment may, for a 
taxable year ending on or after December 31, 1956, at the option of the 
taxpayer, be computed as follows:
    (1) In case of an individual--(i) Gross income of less than 
specified amount. If the gross income, computed as provided in paragraph 
(b) of this section, from such trade or business is $2,400 or less 
($1,800 or less for a taxable year ending on or after December 31, 1956, 
and beginning before January 1, 1966), the taxpayer may, at his option, 
treat as net earnings from self-employment from such trade or business 
an amount equal to 66\2/3\ percent of such gross income. If the taxpayer 
so elects, the amount equal to 66\2/3\ percent of such gross income 
shall be used in computing his self-employment income in lieu of his 
actual net earnings from such trade or business, if any.
    (ii) Gross income in excess of specified amount. If the gross 
income, computed as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, from such 
trade or business is more than $2,400 ($1,800 for a taxable year ending 
on or after December 31, 1956, and beginning before January 1, 1966), 
and the net earnings from self-employment from such trade or business 
(computed without regard to this section) are less than $1,600 ($1,200 
for a taxable year ending on or after December 31, 1956, and beginning 
before January 1, 1966), the taxpayer may, at his option, treat $1,600 
($1,200 for a taxable year ending on or after December 31,

[[Page 24]]

1956, and beginning before January 1, 1966) as net earnings from self-
employment. If the taxpayer so elects, $1,600 ($1,200 for a taxable year 
ending on or after December 31, 1956, and beginning before January 1, 
1966) shall be used in computing his self-employment income in lieu of 
his actual net earnings from such trade or business, if any. However, if 
the taxpayer's actual net earnings from such trade or business, as 
computed in accordance with the applicable provisions of Sec. Sec. 
1.1402(a)-1 to 1.1402(a)-13, inclusive, are $1,600 or more ($1,200 or 
more for a taxable year ending on or after December 31, 1956, and 
beginning before January 1, 1966) such actual net earnings shall be used 
in computing his self-employment income.
    (2) In case of a member of a partnership--(i) Distributive share of 
gross income of less than specified amount. If a taxpayer's distributive 
share of the gross income of a partnership (as such gross income is 
computed under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section) derived 
from such trade or business (after such gross income has been reduced by 
the sum of all payments to which section 707(c) applies) is $2,400 or 
less ($1,800 or less for a taxable year ending on or after December 31, 
1956, and beginning before January 1, 1966), the taxpayer may, at his 
option, treat as his distributive share of income described in section 
702(a)(9) derived from such trade or business an amount equal to 66\2/3\ 
percent of his distributive share of such gross income (after such gross 
income has been reduced by the sum of all payments to which section 
707(c) applies). If the taxpayer so elects, the amount equal to 66\2/3\ 
percent of his distributive share of such gross income shall be used by 
him in the computation of his net earnings from self-employment in lieu 
of the actual amount of his distributive share of income described in 
section 702(a)(9) from such trade or business, if any.
    (ii) Distributive share of gross income in excess of specified 
amount. If a taxpayer's distributive share of the gross income of the 
partnership (as such gross income is computed under the provisions of 
paragraph (b) of this section) derived from such trade or business 
(after such gross income has been reduced by the sum of all payments to 
which section 707(c) applies) is more than $2,400 ($1,800 for a taxable 
year ending on or after December 31, 1956, and beginning before January 
1, 1966) and the actual amount of his distributive share (whether or not 
distributed) of income described in section 702(a)(9) derived from such 
trade or business (computed without regard to this section) is less than 
$1,600 ($1,200 for a taxable year ending on or after December 31, 1956, 
and beginning before January 1, 1966), the taxpayer may, at his option, 
treat $1,600 ($1,200 for a taxable year ending on or after December 31, 
1956, and beginning before January 1, 1966) as his distributive share of 
income described in section 702(a)(9) derived from such trade or 
business. If the taxpayer so elects, $1,600 ($1,200 for a taxable year 
ending on or after December 31, 1956, and beginning before January 1, 
1966) shall be used by him in the computation of his net earnings from 
self-employment in lieu of the actual amount of his distributive share 
of income described in section 702(a)(9) from such trade or business, if 
any. However, if the actual amount of the taxpayer's distributive share 
of income described in section 702(a)(9) from such trade or business, as 
computed in accordance with the applicable provisions of Sec. Sec. 
1.1402(a)-1 to 1.1402(a)-13, inclusive, is $1,600 or more ($1,200 or 
more for a taxable year ending on or after December 31, 1956, and 
beginning before January 1, 1966), such actual amount of the taxpayer's 
distributive share shall be used in computing his net earnings from 
self-employment.
    (iii) Cross reference. For a special rule in the case of certain 
deceased partners, see paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.1402(f)-1.
    (b) Computation of gross income. For purposes of this section gross 
income has the following meanings:
    (1) In the case of any such trade or business in which the income is 
computed under a cash receipts and disbursements method, the gross 
receipts from such trade or business reduced by the cost or other basis 
of property which was purchased and sold in carrying on such trade or 
business (see paragraphs (a) and (c), other than paragraph (a)(5), of 
Sec. 1.61-4), adjusted (after such reduction) in accordance with the

[[Page 25]]

applicable provisions of Sec. Sec. 1.1402(a)-3 to 1.1402(a)-13, 
inclusive.
    (2) In the case of any such trade or business in which the income is 
computed under an accrual method (see paragraphs (b) and (c), other than 
paragraph (b)(5), of Sec. 1.61-4), the gross income from such trade or 
business, adjusted in accordance with the applicable provisions of 
Sec. Sec. 1.1402(a)-3 to 1.1402(a)-13, inclusive.
    (c) Two or more agricultural activities. If an individual (including 
a member of a partnership) derives gross income (as defined in paragraph 
(b) of this section) from more than one agricultural trade or business, 
such gross income (including his distributive share of the gross income 
of any partnership derived from any such trade or business) shall be 
deemed to have been derived from one trade or business. Thus, such an 
individual shall aggregate his gross income derived from each 
agricultural trade or business carried on by him (which includes, under 
paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.1402(a)-1, any guaranteed payment, within the 
meaning of section 707(c), received by him from a farm partnership of 
which he is a member) and his distributive share of partnership gross 
income (after such gross income has been reduced by any guaranteed 
payment within the meaning of section 707(c)) derived from each farm 
partnership of which he is a member. Such gross income is the amount to 
be considered for purposes of the optional method provided in this 
section for computing net earnings from self-employment. If the 
aggregate gross income of an individual includes income derived from an 
agricultural trade or business carried on by him and a distributive 
share of partnership income derived from an agricultural trade or 
business carried on by a partnership of which he is a member, such 
aggregate gross income shall be treated as income derived from a single 
trade or business carried on by him, and such individual shall apply the 
optional method applicable to individuals set forth in paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section for purposes of computing his net earnings from self-
employment.
    (d) Examples. The application of this section may be illustrated by 
the following examples:

    Example (1). F is engaged in the business of farming and computes 
his income under the cash receipts and disbursements method. He files 
his income tax returns on the basis of the calendar year. During the 
year 1966, F's gross income from the business of farming (computed in 
accordance with paragraph (b) (1) of this section) is $2,325. His actual 
net earnings from self-employment derived from such business are $1,250. 
As his net earnings from self-employment, F may report $1,250 or, by the 
optional computation method, he may report $1,550 (66\2/3\ percent of 
$2,325).
    Example (2). G is engaged in the business of farming and computes 
his income under the accrual method. His income tax returns are filed on 
the calendar year basis. For the year 1966, G's gross income from the 
operation of his farm (computed in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section) is $2,800. He has actual net earnings from self-employment 
derived from such farm in the amount of $1,250. As his net earnings from 
self-employment derived from his farm, G may report his actual net 
earnings of $1,250, or by the optional method he may report $1,600. If 
G's actual net earnings from self-employment from his farming activities 
for 1966 were in an amount of $1,600 or more, he would be required to 
report such amount in computing his self-employment income.
    Example (3). M, who files his income tax returns on a calendar year 
basis, is one of the three partners of the XYZ Company, a partnership, 
engaged in the business of farming. The taxable year of the partnership 
is the calendar year, and its income is computed under the cash receipts 
and disbursements method. For M's services in connection with the 
planting, cultivating, and harvesting of the crops during the year 1966 
the partnership agrees to pay him $500, the full amount of which is 
determined without regard to the income of the partnership and 
constitutes a guaranteed payment within the meaning of section 707(c). 
This guaranteed payment to M is the only such payment made during such 
year. The gross income derived from the business for the year 1966 
computed in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section and after 
being reduced by the guaranteed payment of $500 made to M, is $3,000. 
One-third of the $3,000 ($1,000), is M's distributive share of such 
gross income. Under paragraph (c) of this section, the guaranteed 
payment ($500) received by M and his distributive share of the 
partnership gross income ($1,000) are deemed to have been derived from 
one trade or business, and such amounts must be aggregated for purposes 
of the optional method of computing net earnings from self-employment. 
Since M's combined gross income from his two agricultural businesses 
($1,000 and $500) is not more than $2,400 and since such income is 
deemed to be derived from one trade or business, M's net earnings from 
self-employment derived from such

[[Page 26]]

farming business may, at his option, be deemed to be $1,000 (66\2/3\ 
percent of $1,500).
    Example (4). A is one of the two partners of the AB partnership 
which is engaged in the business of farming. The taxable year of the 
partnership is the calendar year and its income is computed under the 
accrual method. A files his income tax returns on the calendar year 
basis. The partnership agreement provides for an equal sharing in the 
profits and losses of the partnership by the two partners. A is an 
experienced farmer and for his services as manager of the partnership's 
farm activities during the year 1966 he receives $6,000 which amount 
constitutes a guaranteed payment within the meaning of section 707(c). 
The gross income of the partnership derived from such business for the 
year 1966, computed in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section 
and after being reduced by the guaranteed payment made to A, is $9,600. 
A's distributive share of such gross income is $4,800 and his 
distributive share of income described in section 702(a)(9) derived from 
the partnership's business is $1,900. Under paragraph (c) of this 
section, the guaranteed payment received by A and his distributive share 
of the partnership gross income are deemed to have been derived from one 
trade or business, and such amounts must be aggregated for purposes of 
the optional method of computing his net earnings from self-employment. 
Since the aggregate of A's guaranteed payment ($6,000) and his 
distributive share of partnership gross income ($4,800) is more than 
$2,400 and since the aggregate of A's guaranteed payment ($6,000) and 
his distributive share ($1,900) of partnership income described in 
section 702(a)(9) is not less than $1,600, the optional method of 
computing net earnings from self-employment is not available to A.
    Example (5). F is a member of the EFG partnership which is engaged 
in the business of farming. F files his income tax returns on the 
calendar year basis. The taxable year of the partnership is the calendar 
year, and its income is computed under a cash receipts and disbursements 
method. Under the partnership agreement the partners are to share 
equally the profits or losses of the business. The gross income derived 
from the partnership business for the year 1966, computed in accordance 
with paragraph (b)(1) of this section is $7,500. F's share of such gross 
income is $2,500. Due to drought and an epidemic among the livestock, 
the partnership sustains a net loss of $7,800 for the year 1966 of which 
loss F's share is $2,600. Since F's distributive share of gross income 
derived from such business is in excess of $2,400 and since F does not 
receive income described in section 702(a)(9) of $1,600 or more from 
such business, he may, at his option, be deemed to have received $1,600 
as his distributive share of income described in section 702(a)(9) from 
such business.

Sec. 1.1402(a)-16  Exercise of option.

    A taxpayer shall, for each taxable year with respect to which he is 
eligible to use the optional method described in Sec. 1.1402(a)-14 or 
Sec. 1.1402(a)-15, make a determination as to whether his net earnings 
from self-employment are to be computed in accordance with such method. 
If the taxpayer elects the optional method for a taxable year, he shall 
signify such election by computing net earnings from self-employment 
under the optional method as set forth in Schedule F (Form 1040) of the 
income tax return filed by the taxpayer for such taxable year. If the 
optional method is not elected at the time of the filing of the return 
for a taxable year with respect to which the taxpayer is eligible to 
elect such optional method, such method may be elected on an amended 
return (or on such other form as may be prescribed for such use) filed 
within the period prescribed by section 6501 and the regulations 
thereunder for the assessment of the tax for such taxable year. If the 
optional method is elected on a return for a taxable year, the taxpayer 
may revoke such election by filing an amended return (or such other form 
as may be prescribed for such use) for the taxable year within the 
period prescribed by section 6501 and the regulations thereunder for the 
assessment of the tax for such taxable year. If the taxpayer is deceased 
or unable to make an election, the person designated in section 6012(b) 
and the regulations thereunder may, within the period prescribed in this 
section elect the optional method for any taxable year with respect to 
which the taxpayer is eligible to use the optional method and revoke an 
election previously made by or for the taxpayer.

Sec. 1.1402(a)-17  Retirement payments to retired partners.

    (a) In general. There shall be excluded, in computing net earnings 
from self-employment for taxable years ending on or after December 31, 
1967, certain payments made on a periodic basis

[[Page 27]]

by a partnership, pursuant to a written plan of the partnership, to a 
retired partner on account of his retirement. The exclusion applies only 
if the payments are made pursuant to a plan which meets the requirements 
prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section, and, in addition, the 
conditions set forth in paragraph (c) of this section are met.
    (b) Retirement plan of partnership. (1) To meet the requirements of 
section 1402(a)(10), the written plan of the partnership must set forth 
the terms and conditions of the program or system established by the 
partnership for the purpose of making payments to retired partners on 
account of their retirement. To qualify as payments on account of 
retirement, the payments must constitute bona fide retirement income. 
Thus, payments of benefits not customarily included in a pension or 
retirement plan such as layoff benefits are not payments on account of 
retirement. Eligibility for retirement generally is established on the 
basis of age, physical condition, or a combination of age or physical 
condition and years of service. Generally, retirement benefits are 
measured by, and based on, such factors as years of service and 
compensation received. In determining whether the plan of the 
partnership provides for payments on account of retirement, factors, 
formulas, etc., reflected in public, and in broad based private, pension 
or retirement plans in prescribing eligibility requirements and in 
computing benefits may be taken into account.
    (2) The plan of the partnership must provide for payments on account 
of retirement:
    (i) To partners generally or to a class or classes of partners,
    (ii) On a periodic basis, and
    (iii) Which continue at least until the partner's death.

For purposes of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, a class of 
partners may, in an appropriate case, contain only one member. Payments 
are made on a periodic basis if made at regularly recurring intervals 
(usually monthly) not exceeding one year.
    (c) Conditions relating to exclusion--(1) In general. A payment made 
pursuant to a written plan of a partnership which meets the requirements 
of paragraph (b) of this section shall be excluded, in computing net 
earnings from self-employment, only if:
    (i) The retired partner to whom the payment is made rendered no 
service with respect to any trade or business carried on by the 
partnership (or its successors) during the taxable year of the 
partnership (or its successors), which ends within or with the taxable 
year of the retired partner and in which the payment was received by 
him;
    (ii) No obligation (whether certain in amount or contingent on a 
subsequent event) exists (as of the close of the partnership's taxable 
year referred to in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph) from the other 
partners to the retired partner except with respect to retirement 
payments under the plan or rights such as benefits payable on account of 
sickness, accident, hospitalization, medical expenses, or death; and
    (iii) The retired partner's share (if any) of the capital of the 
partnership has been paid to him in full before the close of the 
partnership's taxable year referred to in subdivision (i) of this 
subparagraph.

By application of the conditions set forth in this subparagraph, either 
all payments on account of retirement received by a retired partner 
during the taxable year of the partnership ending within or with his 
taxable year are excluded or none of the payments are excluded. 
Subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph has application only to 
obligations from other partners in their capacity as partners as 
distinguished from an obligation which arose and exists from a 
transaction unrelated to the partnership or to a trade or business 
carried on by the partnership. The effect of the conditions set forth in 
subdivisions (ii) and (iii) of this subparagraph is that the exclusion 
may apply with respect to payments received by a retired partner during 
the taxable year of the partnership ending within or with his taxable 
year only if at the close of the partnership's taxable year the retired 
partner had no financial interest in the partnership except for the 
right to retirement payments.

[[Page 28]]

    (2) Examples. The application of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph 
may be illustrated by the following examples. Each example assumes that 
the partnership plan pursuant to which the payments are made meets the 
requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.

    Example (1). A, who files his income tax returns on a calendar year 
basis, is a partner in the ABC partnership. The taxable year of the 
partnership is the period July 1 to June 30, inclusive. A retired from 
the partnership on January 1, 1973, and receives monthly payments on 
account of his retirement. As of June 30, 1973, no obligation existed 
from the other partners to A (except with respect to retirement payments 
under the plan) and A's share of the capital of the partnership had been 
paid to him in full. The monthly retirement payments received by A from 
the partnership in his taxable year ending on December 31, 1973, are not 
excluded from net earnings from self-employment since A rendered service 
to the partnership during a portion of the partnership's taxable year 
(July 1, 1972, through June 30, 1973) which ends within A's taxable year 
ending on December 31, 1973.
    Example (2). D, a partner in the DEF partnership, retired from the 
partnership as of the close of December 31, 1972. The taxable year of 
both D and the partnership is the calendar year. During the 
partnership's taxable year ending December 31, 1973, D rendered no 
service with respect to any trade or business carried on by the 
partnership. On or before December 31, 1973, all obligations (other than 
with respect to retirement payments under the plan) from the other 
partners to D have been liquidated, and D's share of the capital of the 
partnership has been paid to him. Retirement payments received by D 
pursuant to the partnership's plan in his taxable year ending December 
31, 1973, are excluded in determining his net earnings from self-
employment (if any) for that taxable year.
    Example (3). Assume the same facts as in example (2) except that as 
of the close of December 31, 1973, D has a right to a fixed percentage 
of any amounts collected by the partnership after that date which are 
attributable to services rendered by him prior to his retirement for 
clients of the partnership. The monthly payments received by D in his 
taxable year ending December 31, 1973, are not excluded from net 
earnings from self-employment since as of the close of the partnership's 
taxable year which ends with D's taxable year, an obligation (other than 
an obligation with respect to retirement payments) exists from the other 
partners to D.

Sec. 1.1402(b)-1  Self-employment income.

    (a) In general. Except for the exclusions in paragraphs (b) and (c) 
of this section and the exception in paragraph (d) of this section, the 
term ``self-employment income'' means the net earnings from self-
employment derived by an individual during a taxable year.
    (b) Maximum self-employment income--(1) General rule. Subject to the 
special rules described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, the 
maximum self-employment income of an individual for a taxable year 
(whether a period of 12 months or less) is:
    (i) For any taxable year beginning in a calendar year after 1974, an 
amount equal to the contribution and benefit base (as determined under 
section 230 of the Social Security Act) which is effective for such 
calendar year; and
    (ii) For any taxable year:
Ending before 1955................................................$3,600
Ending after 1954 and before 1959..................................4,200
Ending after 1958 and before 1966..................................4,800
Ending after 1965 and before 1968..................................6,600
Ending after 1967 and beginning before 1972........................7,800
Beginning after 1971 and before 1973...............................9,000
Beginning after 1972 and before 1974..............................10,800
Beginning after 1973 and before 1975..............................13,200
    (2) Special rules. (i) If an individual is paid wages as defined in 
subparagraph (3) of this paragraph in a taxable year, the maximum self-
employment income for such taxable year is computed as provided in 
subdivision (ii) or (iii) of this subparagraph.
    (ii) If an individual is paid wages as defined in subparagraph (3) 
(i) or (ii) of this paragraph in a taxable year, the maximum self-
employment income of such individual for such taxable year is the excess 
of the amounts indicated in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph over the 
amount of the wages, as defined in subparagraph (3) (i) and (ii) of this 
paragraph, paid to him during the taxable year. For example, if for his 
taxable year beginning in 1974, an individual has $15,000 of net 
earnings from

[[Page 29]]

self-employment and during such taxable year is paid $1,000 of wages as 
defined in section 3121(a) (see subparagraph (3)(i) of this paragraph), 
he has $12,200 ($13,200 -$1,000) of self-employment income for the 
taxable year.
    (iii) For taxable years ending on or after December 31, 1968, wages, 
as defined in subparagraph (3)(iii) of this paragraph, are taken into 
account in determining the maximum self-employment income of an 
individual for purposes of the tax imposed under section 1401(b) 
(hospital insurance), but not for purposes of the tax imposed under 
section 1401(a) (old-age survivors, and disability insurance). If an 
individual is paid wages as defined in subparagraph (3)(iii) of this 
paragraph in a taxable year, his maximum self-employment income for such 
taxable year for purposes of the tax imposed under section 1401(a) is 
computed under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph or subdivision (ii) of 
this subparagraph (whichever is applicable), and his maximum self-
employment income for such taxable year for purposes of the tax imposed 
under section 1401(b) is the excess of his section 1401(a) maximum self-
employment income over the amount of wages, as defined in subparagraph 
(3)(iii) of this paragraph, paid to him during the taxable year. For 
purposes of this subdivision, wages as defined in subparagraph (3)(iii) 
of this paragraph are deemed paid to an individual in the period with 
respect to which the payment is made, that is, the period in which the 
compensation was earned or deemed earned within the meaning of section 
3231(e). For an explanation of the term ``compensation'' and for 
provisions relating to when compensation is earned, see the regulations 
under section 3231(e) in part 31 of this chapter (Employment Tax 
Regulations). The application of the rules set forth in this subdivision 
may be illustrated by the following example:

    Example. M, a calendar-year taxpayer, has $15,000 of net earnings 
from self-employment for 1974 and during the taxable year is paid $1,000 
of wages as defined in section 3121(a) (see subparagraph (3)(i) of this 
paragraph) and $1,600 of compensation subject to tax under section 3201 
(see subparagraph (3)(iii) of this paragraph). Of the $1,600 of taxable 
compensation, $1,200 represents compensation for services rendered in 
1974 and the balance ($400) represents compensation which pursuant to 
the provisions of section 3231(e) is earned or deemed earned in 1973. 
M's maximum self-employment income for 1974 for purposes of the tax 
imposed under section 1401(a), computed as provided in subdivision (ii) 
of this subparagraph, is $12,200 ($13,200-$1,000), and for purposes of 
the tax imposed under section 1401(b) is $11,000 ($12,200-$1,200). 
However, M may recompute his maximum self-employment income for 1973 for 
purposes of the tax imposed under section 1401(b) by taking into account 
the $400 of compensation which is deemed paid in 1973.

    (3) Meaning of term ``wages''. For the purpose of the computation 
described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, the term ``wages'' 
includes:
    (i) Wages as defined in section 3121(a);
    (ii) Such remuneration paid to an employee for services covered by:
    (a) An agreement entered into pursuant to section 218 of the Social 
Security Act (42 U.S.C. 418), which section provides for extension of 
the Federal old-age, survivors and disability insurance system to State 
and local government employees under voluntary agreements between the 
States and the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (Federal 
Security Administrator before April 11, 1953), or
    (b) An agreement entered into pursuant to the provisions of section 
3121(1), relating to coverage of citizens of the United States who are 
employees of foreign subsidiaries of domestic corporations,

as would be wages under section 3121(a) if such services constituted 
employment under section 3121(b). For an explanation of the term 
``wages'', see the regulations under section 3121(a) in part 31 of this 
chapter (Employment Tax Regulations); and
    (iii) Compensation, as defined in section 3231(e), which is subject 
to the employee tax imposed by section 3201 or the employee 
representative tax imposed by section 3211.
    (c) Minimum net earnings from self-employment. Self-employment 
income does not include the net earnings from self-employment of an 
individual when the amount of such earnings for the taxable year is less 
than $400. Thus, an

[[Page 30]]

individual having only $300 of net earnings from self-employment for the 
taxable year would not have any self-employment income. However, an 
individual having net earnings from self-employment of $400 or more for 
the taxable year may, by application of paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section, have less than $400 of self-employment income for purposes of 
the tax imposed under section 1401(a) and the tax imposed under section 
1401(b) or may have self-employment income of $400 or more for purposes 
of the tax imposed under section 1401(a) and of less than $400 for 
purposes of the tax imposed under section 1401(b). This could occur in a 
case in which the amount of the individual's net earnings from self-
employment is $400 or more for a taxable year and the amount of such net 
earnings from self-employment plus the amount of wages, as defined in 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section, paid to him during the taxable year 
exceed the maximum self-employment income, as set forth in paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section, for the taxable year. However, the result occurs 
only if such maximum self-employment income exceeds the amount of such 
wages. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the 
following example:

    Example. For 1974 M, a calendar-year taxpayer, has net earnings from 
self-employment of $2,000 and wages (as defined in paragraph (b)(3) (i) 
and (ii) of this section) of $12,500. Since M's net earnings from self-
employment plus his wages exceed the maximum self-employment income for 
1974 ($13,200), his self-employment income for 1974 is $700 ($13,200-
$12,500). If M also had wages, as defined in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of 
this section, of $200, his self-employment income would be $700 for 
purposes of the tax imposed under section 1401(a) and $500 ($13,200-
$12,700 ($12,500+$200)) for purposes of the tax imposed under section 
1401(b).


For provisions relating to when wages as defined in paragraph 
(b)(3)(iii) of this section are treated as paid, see paragraph 
(b)(2)(iii) of this section.
    (d) Nonresident aliens. A nonresident alien individual never has 
self-employment income. While a nonresident alien individual who derives 
income from a trade or business carried on within the United States, 
Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, or American Samoa (whether by 
agents or employees, or by a partnership of which he is a member) may be 
subject to the applicable income tax provisions on such income, such 
nonresident alien individual will not be subject to the tax on self-
employment income, since any net earnings which he may have from self-
employment do not constitute self-employment income. For the purpose of 
the tax on self-employment income, an individual who is not a citizen of 
the United States but who is a resident of the Commonwealth of Puerto 
Rico, the Virgin Islands, or, for taxable years beginning after 1960, of 
Guam or American Samoa is not considered to be a nonresident alien 
individual.

Sec. 1.1402(c)-1  Trade or business.

    In order for an individual to have net earnings from self-
employment, he must carry on a trade or business, either as an 
individual or as a member of a partnership. Except for the exclusions 
discussed in Sec. Sec. 1.1402(c)-2 to 1.1402(c)-7, inclusive, the term 
``trade or business'', for the purpose of the tax on self-employment 
income, shall have the same meaning as when used in section 162. An 
individual engaged in one of the excluded activities specified in such 
sections of the regulations may also be engaged in carrying on 
activities which constitute a trade or business for purposes of the tax 
on self-employment income. Whether or not he is also engaged in carrying 
on a trade or business will be dependent upon all of the facts and 
circumstances in the particular case. An individual who is a crew 
leader, as defined in section 3121(o) (see such section and the 
regulations thereunder in part 31 of this chapter (Employment Tax 
Regulations)), is considered to be engaged in carrying on a trade or 
business with respect to services performed by him after 1956 in 
furnishing individuals to perform agricultural labor for another person 
or services performed by him after 1956 as a member of the crew.

Sec. 1.1402(c)-2  Public office.

    (a) In general--(1) General rule. Except as otherwise provided in 
subparagraph

[[Page 31]]

(2) of this paragraph, the performance of the functions of a public 
office does not constitute a trade or business.
    (2) Fee basis public officials--(i) In general. If an individual 
receives fees after 1967 for the performance of the functions of a 
public office of a State or a political subdivision thereof for which he 
is compensated solely on a fee basis, and if the service performed in 
such office is eligible for (but is not made the subject of) an 
agreement between the State and the Secretary of Health, Education, and 
Welfare pursuant to section 218 of the Social Security Act to extend 
social security coverage thereto, the service for which such fees are 
received constitutes a trade or business within the meaning of section 
1402(c) and Sec. 1.1402(c)-1. If an individual performs service for a 
State or a political subdivision thereof in any period in more than one 
position, each position is treated separately for purposes of the 
preceding sentence. See also paragraph (f) of Sec. 1.1402(c)-3 relating 
to the performance of service by an individual as an employee of a State 
or a political subdivision thereof in a position compensated solely on a 
fee basis.
    (ii) Election with respect to fees received in 1968. (A) Any 
individual who in 1968 receives fees for service performed by him with 
respect to the functions of a public office of a State or a political 
subdivision thereof in any period in which the functions are performed 
in a position compensated solely on a fee basis may elect, if the 
performance of the service for which such fees are received constitutes 
a trade or business pursuant to the provisions of subdivision (i) of 
this subparagraph, to have such performance of service treated as 
excluded from the term ``trade or business'' for the purpose of the tax 
on self-employment income, pursuant to the provisions of section 
122(c)(2) of the Social Security Amendments of 1967 (as quoted in Sec. 
1.1402(c)). Such election shall not be limited to service to which the 
fees received in 1968 are attributable but must also be applicable to 
service (if any) in subsequent years which, except for the election, 
would constitute a trade or business pursuant to the provisions of 
subdivision (i) of this subparagraph. An election made pursuant to the 
provisions of this subparagraph is irrevocable.
    (B) The election referred to in subdivision (ii)(A) of this 
subparagraph shall be made by filing a certificate of election of 
exemption (Form 4415) on or before the due date of the income tax return 
(see section 6072), including any extension thereof (see section 6081), 
for the taxable year of the individual making the election which begins 
in 1968. The certificate of election of exemption shall be filed with an 
internal revenue office in accordance with the instructions on the 
certificate.
    (b) Meaning of public office. The term ``public office'' includes 
any elective or appointive office of the United States or any possession 
thereof, of the District of Columbia, of a State or its political 
subdivisions, or a wholly-owned instrumentality of any one or more of 
the foregoing. For example, the President, the Vice President, a 
governor, a mayor, the Secretary of State, a member of Congress, a State 
representative, a county commissioner, a judge, a justice of the peace, 
a county or city attorney, a marshal, a sheriff, a constable, a 
registrar of deeds, or a notary public performs the functions of a 
public office. (However, the service of a notary public could not be 
made the subject of a section 218 agreement under the Social Security 
Act because notaries are not ``employees'' within the meaning of that 
section. Accordingly, such service does not constitute a trade or 
business.)

[T.D. 7333, 39 FR 44448, Dec. 24, 1974, as amended by T.D. 7372, 40 FR

<R05>
Sec. 1.1402(c)-3  Employees.

    (a) General rule. Generally, the performance of service by an 
individual as an employee, as defined in the Federal Insurance 
Contributions Act (Chapter 21 of the Internal Revenue Code) does not 
constitute a trade or business within the meaning of section 1402(c) and 
Sec. 1.1402(c)-1. However, in six cases set forth in paragraphs (b) to 
(g), inclusive, of this section, the performance of service by an 
individual is considered to constitute a trade or business within the 
meaning of section 1402(c) and Sec. 1.1402(c)-1. (As to when an 
individual is an employee, see section 3121 (d) and

[[Page 32]]

(o) and section 3506 and the regulations under those sections in part 31 
of this chapter (Employment Tax Regulations).)
    (b) Newspaper vendors. Service performed by an individual who has 
attained the age of 18 constitutes a trade or business for purposes of 
the tax on self-employment income within the meaning of section 1402(c) 
and Sec. 1.1402(c)-1 if performed in, and at the time of, the sale of 
newspapers or magazines to ultimate consumers, under an arrangement 
under which the newspapers or magazines are to be sold by him at a fixed 
price, his compensation being based on the retention of the excess of 
such price over the amount at which the newspapers or magazines are 
charged to him, whether or not he is guaranteed a minimum amount of 
compensation for such service, or is entitled to be credited with the 
unsold newspapers or magazines turned back.
    (c) Sharecroppers. Service performed by an individual under an 
arrangement with the owner or tenant of land pursuant to which:
    (1) Such individual undertakes to produce agricultural or 
horticultural commodities (including livestock, bees, poultry, and fur-
bearing animals and wildlife) on such land,
    (2) The agricultural or horticultural commodities produced by such 
individual, or the proceeds therefrom, are to be divided between such 
individual and such owner or tenant, and
    (3) The amount of such individual's share depends on the amount of 
the agricultural or horticultural commodities produced, constitutes a 
trade or business within the meaning of section 1402(c) and Sec. 
1.1402(c)-1.
    (d) Employees of foreign government, instrumentality wholly owned by 
foreign government, or international organization. Service performed in 
the United States, as defined in section 3121(e)(2) (see such section 
and the regulations thereunder in part 31 of this chapter (Employment 
Tax Regulations)), by an individual who is a citizen of the United 
States constitutes a trade or business within the meaning of section 
1402(c) and Sec. 1.1402(c)-1 if such service is excepted from 
employment, for purposes of the Federal Insurance Contributions Act 
(chapter 21 of the Code), by:
    (1) Section 3121(b)(11), relating to service in the employ of a 
foreign government (for regulations under section 3121(b)(11), see Sec. 
31.3121(b)(11)-1 of this chapter);
    (2) Section 3121(b)(12), relating to service in the employ of an 
instrumentality wholly owned by a foreign government (for regulations 
under section 3121(b)(12), see Sec. 31.3121(b)(12)-1 of this chapter); 
or
    (3) Section 3121(b)(15), relating to service in the employ of an 
international organization (for regulations under section 3121(b)(15), 
see Sec. 31.3121(b)(15)-1 of this chapter).

This paragraph is applicable to service performed in any taxable year 
ending on or after December 31, 1960, except that it does not apply to 
service performed before 1961 in Guam or American Samoa.
    (e) Ministers and members of religious orders--(1) Taxable years 
ending before 1968. Service described in section 1402(c)(4) performed by 
an individual during taxable years ending before 1968 for which a 
certificate filed pursuant to section 1402(e) is in effect constitutes a 
trade or business within the meaning of section 1402(c) and Sec. 
1.1402(c)-1. See also Sec. 1.1402(c)-5.
    (2) Taxable years ending after 1967. Service described in section 
1402(c)(4) performed by an individual during taxable years ending after 
1967 constitutes a trade or business within the meaning of section 
1402(c) and Sec. 1.1402(c)-1 unless an exemption under section 1402(e) 
(see Sec. Sec. 1.1402(e)-1A through 1.1402(e)-4A) is effective with 
respect to such individual for the taxable year during which the service 
is performed. See also Sec. 1.1402(c)-5.
    (f) State and local government employees compensated on fee basis--
(1) In general. (i) Section 1402(c)(2)(E) and this paragraph are 
applicable only with respect to fees received by an individual after 
1967 for service performed by him as an employee of a State or a 
political subdivision thereof in a position compensated solely on a fee 
basis. If an individual performs service for a State or a political 
subdivision thereof in more than one position, each position is

[[Page 33]]

treated separately for purposes of determining whether the service 
performed in such position is performed by an employee and whether 
compensation for service performed in the position is solely on a fee 
basis.
    (ii) If an individual receives fees after 1967 for service performed 
by him as an employee of a State or a political subdivision thereof in a 
position compensated solely on a fee basis, the service for which such 
fees are received constitutes a trade or business within the meaning of 
section 1402(c) and Sec. 1.1402(c)-1 except that if service performed 
in such position is covered under an agreement entered into by the State 
and the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare pursuant to section 
218 of the Social Security Act at the time a fee is received, the 
service to which such fee relates does not constitute a trade or 
business. See also paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.1402(c)-2, relating, in 
part, to the performance of the functions of a public office of a State 
or a political subdivision thereof by an individual.
    (2) Election with respect to fees received in 1968. (i) Any 
individual who in 1968 receives fees for service as an employee of a 
State or a political subdivision thereof in a position compensated 
solely on a fee basis may elect, if the performance of the service for 
which such fees are received constitutes a trade or business pursuant to 
the provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, to have such 
performance of service treated as excluded from the term ``trade or 
business'' for the purpose of the tax on self-employment income, 
pursuant to the provisions of section 122(c)(2) of the Social Security 
Amendments of 1967 (as quoted in Sec. 1.1402(c)). Such election shall 
not be limited to service to which the fees received in 1968 are 
attributable but must also be applicable to service (if any) in 
subsequent years which, except for the election, would constitute a 
trade or business pursuant to the provisions of subparagraph (1) of this 
paragraph. An election made pursuant to the provisions of this 
subparagraph is irrevocable.
    (ii) The election referred to in subdivision (i) of this 
subparagraph shall be made by filing a certificate of election of 
exemption (Form 4415) on or before the due date of the income tax return 
(see section 6072), including any extension thereof (see section 6081), 
for the taxable year of the individual making the election which begins 
in 1968. The certificate of election of exemption shall be filed with an 
internal revenue office in accordance with the instructions on the 
certificate.
    (g) Individuals engaged in fishing. For taxable years ending after 
December 31, 1954, service performed by an individual on a boat engaged 
in catching fish or other forms of aquatic animal life (hereinafter 
``fish'') constitutes a trade or business within the meaning of section 
1402(c) and Sec. 1.1402(c)-1 if the service is excepted from the 
definition of employment by section 3121(b)(20) and Sec. 
31.3121(b)(20)-1(a). However, the preceding sentence does not apply to 
services performed after December 31, 1954, and before October 4, 1976, 
on a boat engaged in catching fish if the owner or operator of the boat 
treated the individual as an employee in the manner described in Sec. 
31.3121(b)(20)-1(b).

Sec. 1.1402(c)-4  Individuals under Railroad Retirement System.

    The performance of service by an individual as an employee or 
employee representative as defined in section 3231(b) and (c), 
respectively (see Sec. Sec. 31.3231(b)-1 and 31.3231(c)-1 of Part 31 of 
this chapter (Employment Tax Regulations)), that is, an individual 
covered under the railroad retirement system, does not constitute a 
trade or business.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1402(c)-5  Ministers and members of religious orders.

    (a) In general--(1) Taxable years ending before 1968. For taxable 
years ending before 1955, a duly ordained, commissioned, or licensed 
minister of a church or a member of a religious order is not engaged in 
carrying on a trade or business with respect to service performed by him 
in the exercise of his ministry or in the exercise of duties required by 
such order. However, for taxable years ending after 1954 and before 
1968, any

[[Page 34]]

individual who is a duly ordained, commissioned, or licensed minister of 
a church or a member of a religious order (other than a member of a 
religious order who has taken a vow of poverty as a member of such 
order) may elect, as provided in Sec. 1.1402(e)(1)-1, to have the 
Federal old-age, survivors, and disability insurance system established 
by title II of the Social Security Act extended to service performed by 
him in his capacity as such a minister or member. If such a minister or 
a member of a religious order makes an election pursuant to Sec. 
1.1402(e)(1)-1 he is, with respect to service performed by him in such 
capacity, engaged in carrying on a trade or business for each taxable 
year to which the election is effective. An election by a minister or 
member of a religious order has no application to service performed by 
such minister or member which is not in the exercise of his ministry or 
in the exercise of duties required by such order.
    (2) Taxable years ending after 1967. For any taxable year ending 
after 1967, a duly ordained, commissioned, or licensed minister of a 
church or a member of a religious order (other than a member of a 
religious order who has taken a vow of poverty as a member of such 
order) is engaged in carrying on a trade or business with respect to 
service performed by him in the exercise of his ministry or in the 
exercise of duties required by such order unless an exemption under 
section 1402(e) (see Sec. Sec. 1.1402(e)-1A through 1.1402(e)-4A) is 
effective with respect to such individual for the taxable year during 
which the service is performed. An exemption which is effective with 
respect to a minister or a member of a religious order has no 
application to service performed by such minister or member which is not 
in the exercise of his ministry or in the exercise of duties required by 
such order.
    (b) Service by a minister in the exercise of his ministry. (1)(i) A 
certificate of election filed by a duly ordained, commissioned, or 
licensed minister of a church under the provisions of Sec. 
1.1402(e)(1)-1 has application only to service performed by him in the 
exercise of his ministry.
    (ii) An exemption under section 1402(e) (see Sec. Sec. 1.1402(e)-1A 
through 1.1402(e)-4A) which is effective with respect to a duly 
ordained, commissioned, or licensed minister of a church has application 
only to service performed by him in the exercise of his ministry.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, service 
performed by a minister in the exercise of his ministry includes the 
ministration of sacerdotal functions and the conduct of religious 
worship, and the control, conduct, and maintenance of religious 
organizations (including the religious boards, societies, and other 
integral agencies of such organizations), under the authority of a 
religious body constituting a church or church denomination. The 
following rules are applicable in determining whether services performed 
by a minister are performed in the exercise of his ministry:
    (i) Whether service performed by a minister constitutes the conduct 
of religious worship or the ministration of sacerdotal functions depends 
on the tenets and practices of the particular religious body 
constituting his church or church denomination.
    (ii) Service performed by a minister in the control, conduct, and 
maintenance of a religious organization relates to directing, managing, 
or promoting the activities of such organization. Any religious 
organization is deemed to be under the authority of a religious body 
constituting a church or church denomination if it is organized and 
dedicated to carrying out the tenets and principles of a faith in 
accordance with either the requirements or sanctions governing the 
creation of institutions of the faith. The term ``religious 
organization'' has the same meaning and application as is given to the 
term for income tax purposes.
    (iii) If a minister is performing service in the conduct of 
religious worship or the ministration of sacerdotal functions, such 
service is in the exercise of his ministry whether or not it is 
performed for a religious organization. The application of this rule may 
be illustrated by the following example:

    Example. M, a duly ordained minister, is engaged to perform service 
as chaplain at N University. M devotes his entire time to performing his 
duties as chaplain which include the conduct of religious worship, 
offering

[[Page 35]]

spiritual counsel to the university students, and teaching a class in 
religion. M is performing service in the exercise of his ministry.

    (iv) If a minister is performing service for an organization which 
is operated as an integral agency of a religious organization under the 
authority of a religious body constituting a church or church 
denomination, all service performed by the minister in the conduct of 
religious worship, in the ministration of sacerdotal functions, or in 
the control, conduct, and maintenance of such organization (see 
subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph) is in the exercise of his 
ministry. The application of this rule may be illustrated by the 
following example:

    Example. M, a duly ordained minister, is engaged by the N Religious 
Board to serve as director of one of its departments. He performs no 
other service. The N Religious Board is an integral agency of O, a 
religious organization operating under the authority of a religious body 
constituting a church denomination. M is performing service in the 
exercise of his ministry.

    (v) If a minister, pursuant to an assignment or designation by a 
religious body constituting his church, performs service for an 
organization which is neither a religious organization nor operated as 
an integral agency of a religious organization, all service performed by 
him, even though such service may not involve the conduct of religious 
worship or the ministration of sacerdotal functions, is in the exercise 
of his ministry. The application of this rule may be illustrated by the 
following example:

    Example. M, a duly ordained minister, is assigned by X, the 
religious body constituting his church, to perform advisory service to Y 
Company in connection with the publication of a book dealing with the 
history of M's church denomination. Y is neither a religious 
organization nor operated as an integral agency of a religious 
organization. M performs no other service for X or Y. M is performing 
service in the exercise of his ministry.

    (c) Service by a minister not in the exercise of his ministry. 
(1)(i) A certificate filed by a duly ordained, commissioned, or licensed 
minister of a church under the provisions of Sec. 1.1402(e)(1)-1 has no 
application to service performed by him which is not in the exercise of 
his ministry.
    (ii) An exemption under section 1402(e) (see Sec. Sec. 1.1402(e)-1A 
through 1.1402(e)-4A) which is effective with respect to a duly 
ordained, commissioned, or licensed minister of a church has no 
application to service performed by him which is not in the exercise of 
his ministry.
    (2) If a minister is performing service for an organization which is 
neither a religious organization nor operated as an integral agency of a 
religious organization and the service is not performed pursuant to an 
assignment or designation by his ecclesiastical superiors, then only the 
service performed by him in the conduct of religious worship or the 
ministration of sacerdotal functions is in the exercise of his ministry. 
See, however, subparagraph (3) of this paragraph. The application of the 
rule in this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

    Example. M, a duly ordained minister, is engaged by N University to 
teach history and mathematics. He performs no other service for N 
although from time to time he performs marriages and conducts funerals 
for relatives and friends. N University is neither a religious 
organization nor operated as an integral agency of a religious 
organization. M is not performing the service for N pursuant to an 
assignment or designation by his ecclesiastical superiors. The service 
performed by M for N University is not in the exercise of his ministry. 
However, service performed by M in performing marriages and conducting 
funerals is in the exercise of his ministry.

    (3) Service performed by a duly ordained, commissioned, or licensed 
minister of a church as an employee of the United States, or a State, 
Territory, or possession of the United States, or the District of 
Columbia, or a foreign government, or a political subdivision of any of 
the foregoing, is not considered to be in the exercise of his ministry 
for purposes of the tax on self-employment income, even though such 
service may involve the ministration of sacerdotal functions or the 
conduct of religious worship. Thus, for example, service performed by an 
individual as a chaplain in the Armed Forces of the United States is 
considered to be performed by a commissioned officer in his capacity as 
such, and not by a minister in the

[[Page 36]]

exercise of his ministry. Similarly, service performed by an employee of 
a State as a chaplain in a State prison is considered to be performed by 
a civil servant of the State and not by a minister in the exercise of 
his ministry.
    (d) Service in the exercise of duties required by a religious 
order--(1) Certificate of election. A certificate of election filed by a 
member of a religious order (other than a member of a religious order 
who has taken a vow of poverty as a member of such order) under the 
provisions of Sec. 1.1402(e)(1)-1 has application to all duties 
required of him by such order.
    (2) Exemption. An exemption under section 1402(e) (see Sec. Sec. 
1.1402(e)-1A through 1.1402(e)-4A) which is effective with respect to a 
member of a religious order (other than a member of a religious order 
who has taken a vow of poverty as a member of such order) has 
application only to the duties required of him by such order.
    (3) Service. For purposes of subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this 
paragraph, the nature or extent of the duties required of the member by 
the order is immaterial so long as it is a service which he is directed 
or required to perform by his ecclesiastical superiors.

1965, an individual is engaged in carrying on a trade or business with 
respect to the performance of service in the exercise of his profession 
as a doctor of medicine.
    (ii) Christian Science practitioners. Except as provided in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, for taxable years ending after 1955 
and before 1968, an individual is not engaged in carrying on a trade or 
business with respect to the performance of service in the exercise of 
his profession as a Christian Science practitioner. For provisions 
relating to the performance of service in taxable years ending after 
1967 by an individual in the exercise of his profession as a Christian 
Science practitioner, see paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (b) Christian Science practitioner--(1) Certain taxable years ending

1.1402(e)(1)-1, to have the Federal old-age, survivors, and disability 
insurance system established by title II of the Social Security Act 
extended to service performed by him in the exercise of his profession

Sec. 1.1402(e)(1)-1, the Christian Science practitioner is, with 
respect to the performance of service in the exercise of such 
profession, engaged in carrying on a trade or business for each taxable 
year for which the election is effective. An election by a Christian 
Science practitioner has no application to service performed by him

Science practitioner, engaged in carrying on a trade or business unless 
an exemption under section 1402(e) (see Sec. Sec. 1.1402(e)-1A through 
1.1402(e)-4A) is effective with respect to him for the taxable year 
during which the service is performed. An exemption which is effective 
with respect to a Christian Science practitioner has no application to 
service performed by him which is not in the exercise of his profession 
as a Christian Science practitioner.
    (c) Meaning of terms. The designations in this section are to be 
given their commonly accepted meanings. For taxable years ending after 
1955, an individual who is a doctor of osteopathy, and who is not a 
doctor of medicine within the commonly accepted meaning of that term, is 
deemed, for purposes of this section, not to be engaged in carrying on a 
trade or business in the exercise of the profession of doctor of 
medicine.
    (d) Legal requirements. The exclusions specified in paragraph (a) of 
this section apply only if the individuals meet the legal requirements, 
if any, for practicing their professions in the place where they perform 
the service.
    (e) Partnerships. In the case of a partnership engaged in the 
practice of any of the designated excluded professions, the partnership 
shall not be considered as carrying on a trade or business for the 
purpose of the tax on self-employment income, and none of the 
distributive shares of the income or loss, described in section 
702(a)(9), of such partnership shall be included in computing net 
earnings from self-employment of any member of the partnership. On the 
other hand, where a partnership is engaged in a trade or business not 
within any of the designated excluded professions, each partner must 
include his distributive share of the income or loss, described in 
section 702(a)(9), of such partnership in computing his net earnings 
from self-employment, irrespective of whether such partner is engaged in 
the practice of one or more of such professions and contributes his 
professional services to the partnership.

or makes payments toward the cost of, or provides services for, medical 
care (including the benefits of any insurance system established by the 
Social Security Act),

during any taxable year for which he is granted a tax exemption,

<R05>
Sec. 1.1402(e)-2A  Ministers, members of religious orders and Christian 
Science practitioners; application for exemption from self-employment tax.

    (a) In general. (1) Subject to the limitations set forth in 
subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph, any individual who is (i) a 
duly ordained, commissioned, or licensed minister of a church or a 
member of a religious order (other than a member of a religious order 
who has taken a vow of poverty as a member of such order) or (ii) a 
Christian Science practitioner may request an exemption from the tax on 
self-employment income (see section 1401 and Sec. 1.1401-1) with 
respect to services performed by him in his capacity as a minister or 
member, or as a Christian Science practitioner, as the case may be. Such 
a request shall be made by filing an application for exemption on Form 
4361 in the manner provided in paragraph (b) of this section and within 
the time specified in Sec. 1.1402(e)-3A. For provisions relating to the 
taxable year or years for which an exemption from the tax on self-
employment income with respect to service performed by a minister or 
member or a Christian Science practitioner in his capacity as such is 
effective, see Sec. 1.1402(e)-4A. For additional provisions applicable 
to services performed by individuals referred to in this subparagraph, 
see paragraph (e) of Sec. 1.1402(c)-3 and Sec. 1.1402(c)-5 relating to 
ministers and members of religious orders, and paragraphs (a)(3)(ii) and 
(b) of Sec. 1.1402(c)-6 relating to Christian Science practitioners.
    (2) The application for exemption shall contain, or there shall be 
filed with such application, a statement to the effect that the 
individual making application for exemption is conscientiously opposed 
to, or because of religious principles is opposed to, the acceptance 
(with respect to services performed by him in his capacity as a 
minister, member, or Christian Science practitioner) of any public 
insurance which makes payments in the event of death, disability, old 
age, or retirement or makes payments toward the cost of, or provides 
services for, medical care (including the benefits of any insurance 
system established by the Social Security Act). Thus, ministers, members 
of religious orders, and Christian Science practitioners requesting 
exemption from social security coverage must meet either of two 
alternative tests: (1) A religious principles test which refers to the 
institutional principles and discipline of the particular religious 
denomination to which he belongs, or (2) a conscientious opposition test 
which refers to the opposition because of religious considerations of 
individual ministers, members of religious orders, and Christian Science 
practitioners (rather than opposition based upon the general conscience 
of any such individual or individuals). The term ``public insurance'', 
as used in section 1402(e) and this paragraph, refers to governmental, 
as distinguished from private, insurance and does not include insurance 
carried with a commercial insurance carrier. To be eligible to file an 
application for exemption on Form 4361, a minister, member, or Christian 
Science practitioners need not be opposed to the acceptance of all 
public insurance making payments of this specified type; he must, 
however, be opposed on religious grounds to the acceptance of any such 
payment which, in whole or in part, is based on, or measured by earnings 
from, services performed by in his capacity as a minister or member (see 
Sec. 1.1402(c)-5) or in his capacity as a Christian Science 
practitioner (see paragraph (b)(2) of Sec. 1.1402(c)-6). For example, a 
minister performing service in the exercise of his ministry may be 
eligible to file an application for exemption on Form 4361 even though 
he is not opposed to the acceptance of benefits under the Social 
Security Act with respect to service performed by him which is not in 
the exercise of his ministry.
    (3) An exemption from the tax imposed on self-employment income with 
respect to service performed by a minister, member, or Christian Science 
practitioner in his capacity as such may not be granted to a minister, 
member, or practitioner who (in accordance with the provisions of 
section

[[Page 39]]

1402(e) as in effect prior to amendment by section 115(b)(2) of the 
Social Security Amendments of 1967 (81 Stat. 839)) filed a valid waiver 
certificate on Form 2031 electing to have the Federal old-age, 
survivors, and disability insurance system establish by title II of the 
Social Security Act extended to service performed by him in the exercise 
of his ministry or in the exercise of duties required by the order of 
which he is a member, or in the exercise of his profession as a 
Christian Science practitioner. For provisions relating to waiver 
certificates on Form 2031, see Sec. Sec. 1.1402(e)(1)-1 through 
1.1402(e)(6)-1.
    (b) Application for exemption. An application for exemption on Form 
4361 shall be filed in triplicate with the internal revenue officer or 
the internal revenue office, as the case may be, designated in the 
instructions relating to the application for exemption. The application 
for exemption must be filed within the time prescribed in Sec. 
1.1402(e)-3A. If the last original Federal income tax return of an 
individual to whom paragraph (a) of this section applies which was filed 
before the expiration of such time limitation for filing an application 
for exemption shows no liability for tax on self-employment income, such 
return will be treated as an application for exemption, provided that 
before February 28, 1975 such individual also files a properly executed 
Form 4361.
    (c) Approval of application for exemption. The filing of an 
application for exemption on Form 4361 by a minister, a member of a 
religious order, or a Christian Science practitioner does not constitute 
an exemption from the tax on self-employment income with respect to 
services performed by him in his capacity as a minister, member, or 
practitioner. The exemption is granted only if the application is 
approved by an appropriate internal revenue officer. See Sec. 
1.1402(e)-4A relating to the period for which an exemption is effective.

[T.D. 7333, 39 FR 44448, Dec. 24, 1974; 39 FR 45216, Dec. 31, 1974]


<R05>
Sec. 1.1402(e)-3A  Time limitation for filing application for exemption.

    (a) General rule. (1) Any individual referred to in paragraph (a) of 
Sec. 1.1402(e)-2A who desires an exemption from the tax on self-
employment income with respect to service performed by him in his 
capacity as a minister or member of a religious order or as a Christian 
Science practitioner must file the application for exemption (Form 4361) 
prescribed by Sec. 1.1402(e)-2A on or before whichever of the following 
dates is later:
    (i) The due date of the income tax return (see section 6072), 
including any extension thereof (see section 6081), for his second 
taxable year ending after 1967, or
    (ii) The due date of the income tax return, including any extension 
thereof, for his second taxable year beginning after 1953 for which he 
has net earnings from self-employment of $400 or more, any part of 
which:
    (a) In the case of a duly ordained, commissioned, or licensed 
minister of a church, consists of remuneration for service performed in 
the exercise of his ministry,
    (b) In the case of a member of a religious order who has not taken a 
vow of poverty as a member of such order, consists of remuneration for 
service performed in the exercise of duties required by such order, or
    (c) In the case of a Christian Science practitioner, consists of 
remuneration for service performed in the exercise of his profession as 
a Christian Science practitioner.

See paragraph (c) of this section for provisions relating to the 
computation of net earnings from self-employment.
    (2) If a minister, a member of a religious order, or a Christian 
Science practitioner derives gross income in a taxable year both from 
service performed in such capacity and from the conduct of another trade 
or business, and the deductions allowed by Chapter 1 of the Internal 
Revenue Code which are attributable to the gross income derived from 
service performed in such capacity equal or exceed the gross income 
derived from service performed in such capacity, no part of the net 
earnings from self-employment (computed as prescribed in paragraph (c) 
of this section) for the taxable year shall be considered as derived 
from service performed in such capacity.
    (3) The application of the rules set forth in subparagraphs (1) and 
(2) of

[[Page 40]]

this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

    Example (1). M, who makes his income tax returns on a calendar year 
basis, was ordained as a minister in January 1960. During each of two or 
more taxable years ending before 1968 M has net earnings from self-
employment in excess of $400 some part of which is from service 
performed in the exercise of his ministry. M has not filed an effective 
waiver certificate on Form 2031 (see paragraph (a)(3) of Sec. 
1.1402(e)-2A). If M desires an exemption from the tax on self-employment 
income with respect to service performed in the exercise of his 
ministry, he must file an application for exemption on or before the due 
date of his income tax return for 1969 (his second taxable year ending 
after 1967), or any extension thereof.
    Example (2). M, who makes his income tax returns on a calendar year 
basis, was ordained as a minister in January 1966. M has net earnings of 
$350 for the taxable year 1966 and has net earnings in excess of $400 
for each of his taxable years 1967 and 1968 (some part or all of which 
is derived from service performed in the exercise of his ministry). M 
has not filed an effective waiver certificate on Form 2031 (see 
paragraph (a)(3) of Sec. 1.1402(e)-2A). If M desires an exemption from 
the tax on self-employment income with respect to service performed in 
the exercise of his ministry, he must file an application for exemption 
on or before the due date of his income tax return for 1969 (his second 
taxable year ending after 1967), or any extension thereof.
    Example (3). Assume the same facts as in example (2) except that M 
has net earnings in excess of $400 for each of his taxable years 1967 
and 1969 (but less than $400 in 1968). The application for exemption 
must be filed on or before the due date of his income tax return for 
1969, or any extension thereof.
    Example (4). M was ordained as a minister in May 1973. During each 
of the taxable years 1973 and 1975, M, who makes his income tax returns 
on a calendar year basis, derives net earnings in excess of $400 from 
his activities as a minister. M has net earnings of $350 for the taxable 
year 1974, $200 of which is derived from service performed by him in the 
exercise of his ministry. If M desires an exemption from the tax on 
self-employment income with respect to service performed in the exercise 
of his ministry, he must file an application for exemption on or before 
the due date of his income tax return for 1975, or any extension 
thereof.
    Example (5). M, who was ordained a minister in January 1973, is 
employed as a toolmaker by the XYZ Corporation for the taxable years 
1973 and 1974 and also engages in activities as a minister on weekends. 
M makes his income tax returns on the basis of a calendar year. During 
each of the taxable years 1973 and 1974 M receives wages of $14,000 from 
the XYZ Corporation and derives net earnings of $400 from his activities 
as a minister. If M desires an exemption from the tax on self-employment 
income with respect to service performed in the exercise of his 
ministry, he must file an application for exemption on or before the due 
date of his income tax return for 1974, or any extension thereof. It 
should be noted that although by reason of section 1402(b)(1) (G) and 
(H) no part of the $400 represents ``self-employment income'', 
nevertheless the entire $400 constitutes ``net earnings from self-
employment'' for purposes of fulfilling the requirements of section 
1402(e)(2).
    Example (6). M, who files his income tax returns on a calendar year 
basis, was ordained as a minister in March 1973. During 1973 he receives 
$410 for service performed in the exercise of his ministry. In addition 
to his ministerial services, M is engaged during the year 1973 in a 
mercantile venture from which he derives net earnings from self-
employment in the amount of $4,000. The expenses incurred by him in 
connection with his ministerial services during 1973 and which are 
allowable deductions under Chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code amount 
to $410. During 1974 and 1975, M has net earnings from self-employment 
in amounts of $4,600 and $4,800, respectively, and some part of each of 
these amounts is from the exercise of his ministry. The deductions 
allowed in each of the years 1974 and 1975 by Chapter 1 which are 
attributable to the gross income derived by M from the exercise of his 
ministry in each of such years, respectively, do not equal or exceed 
such gross income in such year. If M desires an exemption from the tax 
on self-employment income with respect to service performed in the 
exercise of his ministry, he must file an application for exemption on 
or before the due date of his income tax return for 1975, or an 
extension thereof.

    (b) Effect of death. The right of an individual to file an 
application for exemption shall cease upon his death. Thus, the 
surviving spouse, administrator, or executor of a decedent shall not be 
permitted to file an application for exemption for such decedent.
    (c) Computation of net earnings--(1) Taxable years ending before 
1968. For purposes of this section net earnings from self-employment for 
taxable years ending before 1968 shall be determined without regard to 
the fact that, without an election under section 1402(e) (as in effect 
prior to amendment by section 115(b)(2) of the Social Security 
Amendments of 1967, see Sec. 1.1402(e)-1A), the performance of services 
by a duly ordained, commissioned, or licensed

[[Page 41]]

minister of a church in the exercise of his ministry, or by a member of 
a religious order in the exercise of duties required by such order, or 
the performance of service by an individual in the exercise of his 
profession as a Christian Science practitioner, does not constitute a 
trade or business for purposes of the tax on self-employment income.
    (2) Taxable years ending after 1967. For purposes of this section 
and Sec. 1.1402(e)-4A net earnings from self-employment for taxable 
years ending after 1967 shall be determined without regard to section 
1402(c) (4) and (5). See Sec. 1.1402(c)-3(e)(2) and Sec. 1.1402(c)-5 
relating to ministers and members of religious orders, and paragraphs 
(a)(3)(ii) and (b) of Sec. 1.1402(c)-6 relating to Christian Science 
practitioners.

Sec. 1.1402(e)-4A  Period for which exemption is effective.

    (a) In general. If an application for exemption on Form 4361:
    (1) Is filed by a minister, a member of a religious order, or a 
Christian Science practitioner eligible to file such an application (see 
particularly paragraph (a) (2) and (3) of Sec. 1.1402(e)-2A), and
    (2) Is approved (see paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.1402(e)-2A),

the exemption from the tax on self-employment income shall be effective 
for the first taxable year ending after 1967 for which such minister, 
member, or practitioner has net earnings from self-employment of $400 or 
more any part of which was derived from the performance of service in 
his capacity as a minister, member, or practitioner, and for all 
succeeding taxable years. See, however, paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) and (d)(2) 
of Sec. 1.1402(c)-5 relating to ministers and members of religious 
orders and paragraph (b)(2) of Sec. 1.1402(c)-6 relating to Christian 
Science practitioners.
    (b) Exemption irrevocable. An exemption granted to a minister, a 
member of a religious order, or a Christian Science practitioner 
pursuant to the provisions of section 1402(e) is irrevocable.

filed after December 31, 1986, by ministers, certain members of religious 
orders, and Christian Science practitioners.

    (a) In general. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section, this section applies to any individual who is a duly ordained, 
commissioned, or licensed minister of a church, member of a religious 
order (other than a member of a religious order who has taken a vow of 
poverty as a member of such order), or a Christian Science practitioner 
who files an application after December 31, 1986, for exemption from the 
tax on self-employment income (see section 1401 and 1.1401-1) with 
respect to services performed by him or her in his or her capacity as a 
minister, member, or practitioner pursuant to Sec. Sec. 1.1402(e)-2A 
through 1.1402(e)-4A. This section does not apply to applications for 
exemption under section 1402(e) that are filed before January 1, 1987.
    (2) Application of this section to Christian Science practitioners. 
Paragraph (b) of this section does not apply to Christian Science 
practitioners. Thus, Christian Science practitioners filing applications 
for exemption from self-employment taxes under section 1402(e) should 
follow the procedures set forth in Sec. Sec. 1.1402(e)-2A through 
1.1402(e)-4A, and are not required to include the statement described in 
paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. However, see paragraph (c) of this 
section for verification procedures with respect to applications for 
exemption from self-employment taxes filed after December 31, 1986, by 
Christian Science practitioners.
    (b) Church or order must be informed--(1) In general. Any 
individual, other than a Christian Science practitioner, who files an 
application for exemption from the tax on self-employment income under 
section 1402(e) after December 31, 1986:
    (i) Shall file such application in accordance with the procedures 
set forth in Sec. Sec. 1.1402(e)-2A through 1.1402(e)-4A, and
    (ii) Shall include with such application a statement to the effect 
that the individual making application for exemption has informed the 
ordaining,

[[Page 42]]

commissioning, or licensing body of the church or order that he or she 
is opposed to the acceptance (for services performed as a minister or 
member of a religious order not under a vow of poverty) of any public 
insurance that makes payments in the event of death, disability, old 
age, or retirement, or that makes payments toward the cost of, or 
provides services for, medical care (including the benefits of any 
insurance system established by the Social Security Act).
    (2) Statement to be filed with form. If the form provided by the 
Service for applying for exemption under 1402(e) does not contain the 
statement set forth in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, any 
individual required to include this statement with his or her 
application under this paragraph (b) shall file such statement with the 
individual's application at the time and place prescribed for filing 
such application under Sec. Sec. 1.1402(e)-2A and 1.1402(e)-3A. The 
statement shall contain the information set forth in paragraph 
(b)(1)(ii) of this section and shall be signed by such individual under 
penalties of perjury.
    (c) Verification of application--(1) In general. The Service will 
approve an application for an exemption filed by an individual to whom 
this section applies only after verifying that the individual applying 
for the exemption is aware of the grounds on which the individual may 
receive an exemption under section 1402(e) (See Sec. 1.1402(e)-2A) and 
that the individual seeks exemption on such grounds in accordance with 
the procedures set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
    (2) Verification procedure. Upon receipt of an application for 
exemption from self-employment taxes under section 1402(e) and this 
section, the Service will mail to the applicant a statement that 
describes the grounds on which an individual may receive an exemption 
under section 1402(e). The individual filing the application shall 
certify that he or she has read the statement and that he or she seeks 
exemption from self-employment taxes on the grounds listed in the 
statement. The certification shall be made by signing a copy of the 
statement under penalties of perjury and mailing the signed copy to the 
Service Center from which the statement was issued not later than 90 
days after the date on which the statement was mailed to the individual. 
If the signed copy of the statement is not mailed to the Service Center 
within 90 days of the date on which the statement was mailed to the 
individual, that individual's exemption will not be effective until the 
date that the signed copy of the statement is received at the Service 
Center.

Sec. 1.1402(e)(1)-1  Election by ministers, members of religious 
orders, and Christian Science practitioners for self-employment coverage.

    (a) In general. Any individual who is (1) a duly ordained, 
commissioned, or licensed minister of a church or a member of a 
religious order (other than a member of a religious order who has taken 
a vow of poverty as a member of such order) or (2) a Christian Science 
practitioner may elect to have the Federal old-age, survivors, and 
disability insurance system established by title II of the Social 
Security Act extended to service performed by him in the exercise of his 
ministry or in the exercise of duties required by such order, or in the 
exercise of his profession as a Christian Science practitioner, as the 
case may be. Such an election shall be made by filing a certificate on 
Form 2031 in the manner provided in paragraph (b) of this section and 
within the time specified in Sec. 1.1402(e)(2)-1. If a minister or 
member to whom this section has application, or a Christian Science 
practitioner, makes an election by filing Form 2031 such individual 
shall, for each taxable year for which the election is effective (see 
Sec. 1.1402(e)(3)-1), be considered as carrying on a trade or business 
with respect to the performance of service in his capacity as a minister 
or member, or as a Christian Science practitioner, as the case may be.
    (b) Waiver certificate. The certificate on Form 2031 shall be filed 
in triplicate with the district director of internal revenue for the 
internal revenue district in which is located the legal residence or 
principal place of business of

[[Page 43]]

the individual who executes the certificate. If such individual has no 
legal residence or principal place of business in any internal revenue 
district, the certificate shall be filed with the Director of 
International Operations, Internal Revenue Service, Washington, DC 
20225, or at such other address as is designated in the instructions 
relating to the certificate. The certificate must be filed within the 
time prescribed in Sec. 1.1402(e)(2)-1. If an individual to whom 
paragraph (a) of this section has application submits to a district 
director of internal revenue a dated and signed statement indicating 
that he desires to have the Federal old-age, survivors, and disability 
insurance system established by title II of the Social Security Act 
extended to his services, such statement will be treated as a waiver 
certificate, if filed within the time specified in Sec. 1.1402(e)(2)-1, 
provided that without unnecessary delay such statement is supplemented 
by a properly executed Form 2031. An application for a social security 
account number filed on Form SS-5 or the filing of an income tax return 
showing an amount representing self-employment income or self-employment 
tax shall not be construed to constitute an election referred to in 
Sec. 1.1402(e)(1)-1.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1402(e)(2)-1  Time limitation for filing waiver certificate.

    (a) General rule. (1) Any individual referred to in Sec. 
1.1402(e)(1)-1 who desires to have the Federal old-age, survivors, and 
disability insurance system established by title II of the Social 
Security Act extended to his services must file the waiver certificate 
(Form 2031) prescribed by Sec. 1.1402(e)(1)-1 on or before whichever of 
the following dates is later:
    (i) The due date of the income tax return (see section 6072), 
including any extension thereof (see section 6081), for his second 
taxable year ending after 1963; or
    (ii) The due date of the income tax return, including any extension 
thereof, for his second taxable year ending after 1954 for which he has 
net earnings from self-employment (computed as prescribed in paragraph 
(c) of this section) of $400 or more, any part of which:
    (a) In the case of a duly ordained, commissioned, or licensed 
minister of a church, consists of remuneration for service performed in 
the exercise of his ministry,
    (b) In the case of a member of a religious order who has not taken a 
vow of poverty as a member of such order, consists of remuneration for 
service performed in the exercise of duties required by such order, or
    (c) In the case of a Christian Science practitioner, consists of 
remuneration for service performed in the exercise of his profession as 
a Chrsitian Science practitioner.
    (2) If a minister, a member of a religious order, or a Christian 
Science practitioner derives gross income in a taxable year both from 
service performed in such capacity and from the conduct of another trade 
or business, and the deductions allowed by chapter 1 of the Internal 
Revenue Code which are attributable to the gross income derived from 
service performed in such capacity equal or exceed the gross income 
derived from service performed in such capacity, no part of the net 
earnings from self-employment (computed as prescribed in paragraph (c) 
of this section) for the taxable year shall be considered as derived 
from service performed in such capacity.
    (3) The application of the rules set forth in subparagraphs (1) and 
(2) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

    Example (1). M was ordained as a minister in May 1963. During each 
of the taxable years 1963 and 1966, M, who makes his income tax returns 
on a calendar year basis, derives net earnings in excess of $400 from 
his activities as a minister. M has net earnings of $350 for each of the 
taxable years 1964 and 1965, $200 of which is derived from service 
performed by him as a minister. If M wishes to have the Federal old-age, 
survivors, and disability insurance system established by title II of 
the Social Security Act extended to his service as a minister, he must 
file the waiver certificate on or before the due date of his income tax 
return for 1966, or any extension thereof.
    Example (2). M, who was ordained a minister in January 1965, is 
employed as a toolmaker by the XYZ Corporation for the taxable years 
1965 and 1966 and also engages in activities as a minister on weekends. 
M makes his income tax return on the basis of a calendar year. During 
each of the taxable years 1965 and 1966, M receives wages of $4,800

[[Page 44]]

from the XYZ Corporation and derives $400 (all of which constitutes net 
earnings from self-employment computed as prescribed in paragraph (c) of 
this section) from his activities as a minister. In such case if M 
wishes to have the Federal old-age, survivors, and disability insurance 
system established by title II of the Social Security Act extended to 
his services as a minister, he must file the waiver certificate on or 
before the due date of his income tax return for 1966, or any extension 
thereof. A waiver certificate filed after such date will be invalid. It 
should be noted that although by reason of section 1402(b)(1)(C) no part 
of the $400 for the taxable year 1965 represents ``self-employment 
income'', nevertheless the entire $400 constitutes ``net earnings from 
self-employment'' for purposes of fulfilling the requirements of section 
1402(e)(2).
    Example (3). M, who files his income tax returns on a calendar year 
basis, was ordained as a minister in June 1964. During 1964 he receives 
$410 for services performed in the exercise of his ministry. In addition 
to his ministerial services, M is engaged during the year 1964 in a 
mercantile venture from which he derives net earnings from self-
employment in the amount of $1,000. The expenses incurred by him in 
connection with his ministerial services during 1964 and which are 
allowable deductions under Chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code amount 
to $410. During 1965 and 1966, M has net earnings from self-employment 
in amounts of $1,200 and $1,500, respectively, and some part of each of 
these amounts is from the exercise of his ministry. The deductions 
allowed in each of the years 1965 and 1966 by Chapter 1 which are 
attributable to the gross income derived by M from the exercise of his 
ministry in each of such years, respectively, do not equal or exceed 
such gross income in such year. If M wishes to have the Federal old-age, 
survivors, and disability insurance system established by Title II of 
the Social Security Act extended to his service as a minister, he must 
file a waiver certificate on or before the due date of his income tax 
return (including any extension thereof) for 1966.
    Example (4). M, a licensed minister who makes his income tax returns 
on the basis of a calendar year, derived net earnings of $400 or more 
from the exercise of his ministry for two or more of the taxable years 
1955 to 1965, inclusive. In such case, if M wishes to have the Federal 
old-age, survivors, and disability insurance system established by Title 
II of the Social Security Act extended to his services as a minister, he 
must file the waiver certificate on or before the due date (April 15, 
1966) prescribed for filing his income tax return for 1965, or any 
extension thereof. A waiver certificate filed after such date will be 
invalid.

    (b) Effect of death. Except as provided in Sec. Sec. 1.1402(e)(5)-
1, 1.1402(e) (5)-2, and 1.1402(e)(6)-1, the right of an individual to 
file a waiver certificate shall cease from his death. Thus, except as 
provided in such sections, the surviving spouse, administrator, or 
executor of a decedent shall not be permitted to file a waiver 
certificate for such decedent.
    (c) Computation of net earnings without regard to election. For the 
purpose of this section net earnings from self-employment shall be 
determined without regard to the fact that, without an election under 
section 1402(e), the performance of services by a duly ordained, 
commissioned, or licensed minister of a church in the exercise of his 
ministry, or by a member of a religious order in the exercise of duties 
required by such order, or the performance of service by an individual 
in the exercise of his profession as a Christian Science practitioner, 
does not constitute a trade or business for purposes of the tax on self-
employment income.

[T.D. 6691, 28 FR 12796, Dec. 3, 1963, as amended by T.D. 6978, 33 FR 
15938, Oct. 30, 1968]


<R05>
Sec. 1.1402(e)(3)-1  Effective date of waiver certificate.

    (a) Filed before August 31, 1957--(1) In general. A certificate on 
Form 2031 filed by an individual before August 31, 1957, in accordance 
with the provisions of section 1402(e) in effect at the time the 
certificate is filed, shall be effective for the first taxable year with 
respect to which it is filed, and all subsequent taxable years. In order 
for a certificate filed by an individual before August 31, 1957, to be 
effective under section 1402(e), the certificate must be made effective 
for either the first or second taxable year ending after 1954 in which 
the individual has net earnings from self-employment of $400 or more 
(determined as provided in paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.1402(e)(2)-1) some 
part of which is derived from service of the character with respect to 
which an election may be made. However, a certificate on Form 2031, 
filed before August 31, 1957, even though filed within the time 
specified in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of Sec. 1.1402(e)(2)-1, may not be 
effective, except as provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, for 
any taxable year with respect to which the due date for

[[Page 45]]

filing the individual's income tax return (including any extension 
thereof) has expired at the time such certificate is filed. Further, a 
certificate on Form 2031 may not be effective for any taxable year 
ending before 1955. In order for a certificate filed before August 31, 
1957, except for the filing of a supplemental certificate, to be 
effective for the first or second taxable year ending after 1954 in 
which the individual has net earnings from self-employment (determined 
as provided in paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.1402(e)(2)-1) some part of which 
is derived from service of the character with respect to which an 
election may be made, the certificate on Form 2031 must be filed on or 
before the due date for filing the income tax return of the individual 
for such first or second taxable year, respectively, or any extension 
thereof.
    (2) Supplemental certificates--(i) Filed before due date of 1958 
return. If under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph the certificate is 
effective only for the individual's third or fourth taxable year ending 
after 1954 and all succeeding taxable years, the individual may make 
such a certificate effective for his first taxable year ending after 
1955 and all succeeding taxable years by filing a supplemental 
certificate on Form 2031. To be valid the supplemental certificate must 
be filed after August 30, 1957, and on or before the due date of the 
return (including any extension thereof) for his second taxable year 
ending after 1956 and must be otherwise in accordance with Sec. 
1.1402(e)(1)-1.

    Example. M, who files his income tax returns on a calendar year 
basis, was ordained as a minister in 1956, and his net earnings from 
service performed in the exercise of his ministry during such year were 
$400 or more. M had no net earnings from the exercise of his ministry 
during 1957. On July 15, 1957, M filed a waiver certificate and 
indicated thereon that it was to become effective for the taxable year 
1958. At the time of filing, the certificate was effective for 1958 and 
all succeeding taxable years. Since the certificate was not filed on or 
before April 15, 1957 (the due date of M's income tax return for the 
taxable year 1956), and since there was no extension of time for filing 
his 1956 income tax return, the certificate was not, at the time of 
filing, effective for the taxable year 1956. M files a supplemental 
certificate on April 15, 1958. By the filing of the supplemental 
certificate, the certificate filed by M on July 15, 1957, was made 
effective for the year 1956 and all succeeding taxable years.

    (ii) Filed after September 13, 1960, and on or before April 16, 
1962. If under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph the certificate is 
effective only for the individual's first taxable year ending after 1956 
and all succeeding taxable years, the individual may make such 
certificate effective for his first taxable year ending after 1955 and 
all succeeding taxable years by:
    (a) Filing a supplemental certificate on Form 2031 after September 
13, 1960, and before April 17, 1962;
    (b) Paying on or before April 16, 1962, the tax under section 1401 
in respect of all the individual's self-employment income (except for 
underpayments of tax attributable to errors made in good faith) for his 
first taxable year ending after 1955; and
    (c) By repaying on or before April 16, 1962, the amount of any 
refund (including any interest paid under section 6611) that has been 
made of any such tax which (but for section 1402(e)(3)(B)) is an 
overpayment.

Any payment or repayment described in section 1402(e)(3)(B) and in this 
subparagraph shall not constitute an overpayment within the meaning of 
section 6401 which relates to amounts treated as overpayments. See 
section 6401 and the regulations thereunder in part 301 of this chapter 
(Regulations on Procedure and Administration).

    Example. M, who files his income tax returns on a calendar year 
basis, was ordained as a minister in 1956, and his net earnings from 
service performed in the exercise of his ministry during each of the 
years 1956 and 1957 were $400 or more. On July 15, 1957, M filed a 
waiver certificate which became effective, at the time of filing, for 
1957 and all succeeding taxable years. Since the certificate was not 
filed on or before April 15, 1957 (the due date of M's income tax return 
for the taxable year 1956), and since there was no extension of time for 
filing his 1956 income tax return, the certificate was not, at the time 
of filing, effective for the taxable year 1956. M files a supplemental 
certificate on April 17, 1961. If, in addition to the filing of the 
supplemental certificate, M pays on or before April 16, 1962, the self-
employment tax in respect of all his self-employment income (except for 
underpayments of tax attributable to errors made in good faith) for his 
taxable year 1956, and repays, on or before

[[Page 46]]

April 16, 1962, the amount of any refund (including any interest paid 
under section 6611) that has been made of any such tax which (but for 
section 1402(e)(3)(B)) is an overpayment, the certificate filed by M on 
July 15, 1957, becomes effective for the year 1956 and all succeeding 
taxable years.

    (b) Filed after August 30, 1957, and before the due date of the 1958 
return. A certificate on Form 2031 filed by an individual after August 
30, 1957, but on or before the due date of the return (including any 
extension thereof) for his second taxable year ending after 1956, in 
accordance with the provisions of section 1402(e) in effect at the time 
the certificate is filed, shall be effective for his first taxable year 
ending after 1955, and all subsequent taxable years.
    (c) Filed after due date of 1958 return--(1) In general. Except as 
otherwise provided in Sec. 1.1402(e)(5)-1 (applicable to certificates 
filed within the period September 14, 1960, to April 16, 1962, 
inclusive) and in subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph, a 
certificate on Form 2031 filed by an individual in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. Sec. 1.1402(e)(1)-1 and 1.1402(e)(2)-1, inclusive, 
after the due date of the return (including any extension thereof) for 
his second taxable year ending after 1956 shall be effective for the 
taxable year immediately preceding the earliest taxable year for which, 
at the time the certificate is filed, the period for filing a return 
(including any extension thereof) has not expired, and for all 
succeeding taxable years.

    Example. M, a duly ordained minister of a church, makes his income 
tax returns on the basis of a calendar year. M has not been granted an 
extension of time for filing any return. On April 15, 1963, the due date 
of his income tax return for 1962, M files a waiver certificate pursuant 
to Sec. 1.1402(e)(1)-1 and within the time limitation set forth in 
Sec. 1.1402(e)(2)-1. On April 15, 1963, the year 1962 is the earliest 
taxable year for which the period for filing a return has not expired. 
Consequently, M's certificate is effective for 1961 and all succeeding 
taxable years. M must report and pay any self-employment tax due for 
1961 and 1962. (The tax, if any, for 1962 is due on April 15, 1963.) 
Inasmuch as the due date of the tax for 1961 is April 16, 1962, M must 
pay interest on any tax due for 1961. For provisions relating to such 
interest, see Sec. 301.6601-1 of Part 301 of this chapter (Regulations 
on Procedure and Administration).

    (2) Filed after October 13, 1964, and on or before the due date of 
return for second taxable year ending after 1962. A certificate on Form 
2031 filed by an individual in accordance with the provisions of 
Sec. Sec. 1.1402(e)(1)-1 and 1.1402(e)(2)-1, inclusive, after October 
13, 1964, and on or before the due date of the return (including any 
extension thereof) for his second taxable year ending after 1962 (April 
15, 1965, in the case of a calendar year taxpayer who has not been 
granted an extension of time for filing his income tax return for 1964) 
shall be effective for his first taxable year ending after 1961 and all 
succeeding taxable years.

    Example. M, a duly ordained minister of a church, makes his income 
tax returns on the basis of a calendar year. M has not been granted an 
extension of time for filing any return. On April 15, 1965, the due date 
of his income tax return for 1964, M files a waiver certificate pursuant 
to Sec. 1.1402(e)(1)-1 and within the time limitation set forth in 
Sec. 1.1402(e)(2)-1. M's certificate is effective for 1962 and all 
succeeding taxable years, and he must report and pay any self-employment 
tax due for 1962, 1963, and 1964. (The tax, if any, for 1964 is due on 
April 15, 1965.) Inasmuch as the due dates of the tax for 1962 and 1963 
are April 15, 1963, and April 15, 1964, respectively, M must pay 
interest on any tax due for 1962 or 1963. For provisions relating to 
such interest, see Sec. 301.6601-1 of Part 301 of this chapter 
(Regulations on Procedure and Administration).

    (3) Filed after July 30, 1965, and on or before the due date of 
return for second taxable year ending after 1963. A certificate on Form 
2031 filed by an individual in accordance with the provisions of 
Sec. Sec. 1.1402(e)(1)-1 and 1.1402(e)(2)-1, inclusive, after July 30, 
1965, and on or before the due date of the return (including any 
extension thereof) for his second taxable year ending after 1963 (Apr. 
15, 1966, in the case of a calendar year taxpayer who has not been 
granted an extension of time for filing his income tax return for 1965) 
shall be effective for his first taxable year ending after 1962 and all 
succeeding taxable years.

    Example. M, a duly ordained minister of a church, makes his income 
tax returns on the basis of a calendar year. M has not been granted an 
extension of time for filing any return. On April 15, 1966, the due date 
of his income tax return for 1965, M files a waiver certificate pursuant 
to Sec. 1.1402(e)(1)-1 and

[[Page 47]]

within the time limitation set forth in Sec. 1.1402(e)(2)-1. M's 
certificate is effective for 1963 and all succeeding taxable years, and 
he must report and pay any self-employment tax due for 1963, 1964, and 
1965. (The tax, if any, for 1965 is due on April 15, 1966.) Inasmuch as 
the due dates of the tax for 1963 and 1964 are April 15, 1964, and April 
15, 1965, respectively, M must pay interest on any tax due for 1963 or 
1964. For provisions relating to such interest, see Sec. 301.6601-1 of 
Part 301 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and Administration).

    (d) Election irrevocable. An election which has become effective 
pursuant to this section is irrevocable. A certificate may not be 
withdrawn after June 30, 1961.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1402(e)(4)-1  Treatment of certain remuneration paid in 1955 and 
1956 as wages.

    If in 1955 or 1956 an individual was paid remuneration for service 
described in section 3121(b)(8)(A) which was erroneously treated by the 
organization employing him (under a certificate filed by such 
organization pursuant to section 3121(k) or the corresponding section of 
prior law) as employment, within the meaning of the Federal Insurance 
Contributions Act (Chapter 21 of the Internal Revenue Code), and if on 
or before August 30, 1957, the taxes imposed by sections 3101 and 3111 
were paid (in good faith and upon the assumption that the insurance 
system established by title II of the Social Security Act had been 
extended to such service) with respect to any part of the remuneration 
paid to such individual for such service, then the remuneration with 
respect to which such taxes were paid, and with respect to which no 
credit or refund of such taxes (other than a credit or refund which 
would be allowable if such service had constituted employment) has been 
obtained either by the employer or the employee on or before August 30, 
1957, shall be deemed, for purposes of the Self-Employment Contributions 
Act of 1954 and the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, to constitute 
remuneration paid for employment and not net earnings from self-
employment. For regulations relating to section 3121(b)(8)(A) and (k), 
see Sec. Sec. 31.3121(b)(8)-1 and 31.3121(k)-1 of subpart B of part 31 
of this chapter (Employment Tax Regulations).


<R05>
Sec. 1.1402(e)(5)-1  Optional provision for certain certificates filed 
before April 15, 1962.

    (a) Certificates. (1) The optional provision contained in section 
1402(e)(5)(A) may be applied to a certificate on Form 2031 filed within 
the period September 14, 1960, to April 16, 1962, inclusive, in the case 
of a duly ordained, commissioned, or licensed minister of a church, a 
member of a religious order (other than a member of a religious order 
who has taken a vow of poverty as a member of such order), or a 
Christian Science practitioner, who has derived net earnings, in any 
taxable year ending after 1954 and before 1960, from the performance of 
service in the exercise of his ministry, in the exercise of duties 
required by his religious order, or in the exercise of his profession as 
a Christian Science practitioner, respectively, and who has reported 
such earnings as self-employment income on a return filed before 
September 14, 1960, and on or before the date prescribed for filing such 
return (including any extension thereof). The certificate may be filed 
by such minister, member of a religious order, or Christian Science 
practitioner or by a fiduciary acting for such individual or his estate, 
or by his survivor within the meaning of section 205(c)(1)(C) of the 
Social Security Act, and it must be filed after September 13, 1960, and 
on or before April 16, 1962. Subject to the conditions stated in 
subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, such certificate may be effective at 
the election of the person filing it, for the first taxable year ending 
after 1954 and before 1960 for which a return, as described in the first 
sentence of this subparagraph, was filed, and for all succeeding taxable 
years, rather than for the period prescribed in Sec. 1.1402(e)(3)-1. 
The election for retroactive application of the certificate may be made 
by indicating on the certificate the first taxable year for which it is 
to be effective and that such year is the first taxable year ending 
after 1954 and before 1960 for which the minister, member of a religious 
order, or Christian Science practitioner filed an

[[Page 48]]

income tax return on which he reported net earnings for such year from 
the exercise of his ministry, the exercise of duties required by his 
religious order, or the exercise of his profession as a Christian 
Science practitioner, as the case may be, and by fulfilling the 
conditions prescribed in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.
    (2) A certificate to which subparagraph (1) of this paragraph 
relates may be effective for a taxable year prior to the taxable year 
immediately preceding the earliest taxable year for which, at the time 
the certificate is filed, the period for filing a return (including any 
extension thereof) has not expired, only if the following conditions are 
met:
    (i) The tax under section 1401 is paid on or before April 16, 1962, 
in respect of all self-employment income (whether or not derived from 
the performance of service by the individual in the exercise of his 
ministry, in the exercise of duties required by his religious order, or 
in the exercise of his profession as a Christian Science practitioner, 
as the case may be) for the first taxable year ending after 1954 and 
before 1960 for which such individual has filed a return, as described 
in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, and for each succeeding taxable 
year ending before 1960; and
    (ii) In any case where refund has been made of any such tax which 
(but for section 1402(e)(5)) is an overpayment, the amount refunded 
(including any interest paid under section 6611) is repaid on or before 
April 16, 1962. For regulations under section 6611 (relating to interest 
on overpayments), see Sec. 301.6611-1 of part 301 of this chapter 
(Regulations on Procedure and Administration).
    (b) Supplemental certificates. (1) Subject to the conditions stated 
in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, a certificate on Form 2031 filed 
on or before September 13, 1960, by a minister, member of a religious 
order, or a Christian Science practitioner described in paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section and which (but for section 1402(e)(5)(B)) is ineffective 
for the first taxable year ending after 1954 and before 1959 for which 
such a return as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section was filed 
by such individual, shall be effective for such first taxable year and 
for all succeeding taxable years, provided a supplemental certificate is 
filed by such individual or by a fiduciary acting for him or his estate, 
or by his survivor (within the meaning of section 205(c)(1)(C) of the 
Social Security Act), after September 13, 1960 and on or before April 
16, 1962.
    (2) The filing of a supplemental certificate pursuant to 
subparagraph (1) of this paragraph will give retroactive effect to a 
certificate to which such subparagraph applies only if the following 
conditions are met:
    (i) The tax under section 1401 is paid on or before April 16, 1962, 
in respect of all self-employment income (whether or not attributable to 
earnings as a minister, member of a religious order, or Christian 
Science practitioner) for the first taxable year for which the 
certificate is retroactively effective and for each subsequent year 
ending before 1959; and
    (ii) In any case where refund has been made of any such tax which 
(but for section 1402(d)(5)) is an overpayment, the amount refunded 
(including any interest paid under section 6611) is repaid on or before 
April 16, 1962.
    (c) Underpayment of tax. For purposes of this section, any 
underpayment of the tax which is attributable to an error made in good 
faith will not invalidate an election which is otherwise valid.
    (d) Nonapplicability of section 6401. Any payment or repayment 
described in paragraph (a)(2) or paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall 
not constitute an overpayment within the meaning of section 6401 which 
relates to amounts treated as overpayments. For the provisions of 
section 6401 and the regulations thereunder, see section 6401 and Sec. 
301.6401-1 of part 301 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and 
Administration).

supplemental certificate is not filed with respect to such certificate 
as provided in this section.

[T.D. 6978, 33 FR 15939, Oct. 30, 1968]


<R05>
Sec. 1.1402(e)(6)-1  Certificates filed by fiduciaries or survivors on 
or before April 15, 1962.

    In any case in which an individual whose death has occurred after 
September 12, 1960, and before April 16, 1962, derived earnings from the 
performance of services as a duly ordained, commissioned, or licensed 
minister of a church in the exercise of his ministry, as a member of a 
religious order (other than a member of a religious order who has taken 
a vow of poverty as a member of such order) in the exercise of duties 
required by such order, or in the exercise of his profession as a 
Christian Science practitioner, a waiver certificate on Form 2031 may be 
filed after June 30, 1961 (the date of enactment of the Social Security 
Amendments of 1961), and on or before April 16, 1962, by a fiduciary 
acting for such individual's estate or by such individual's survivor 
within the meaning of section 205(c)(1)(C) of the Social Security Act. 
Such certificates shall be effective for the period prescribed in 
section 1402(e)(3)(A) (see Sec. 1.1402(e)(3)-1(c)) as if filed by the 
individual on the date of his death.


<R05>
Sec. 1.1402(f)-1  Computation of partner's net earnings from 
self-employment for taxable year which ends as result of his death.

    (a) Taxable years ending after August 28, 1958--(1) In general. The 
rules for the computation of a partner's net earnings from self-
employment are set forth in paragraphs (d) to (g), inclusive, of Sec. 
1.1402(a)-2. In addition to the net earnings from self-employment 
computed under such rules for the last taxable year of a deceased 
partner, if a partner's taxable year ends after August 28, 1958, solely 
because of death, and on a day other than the last day of the 
partnership's taxable year, the deceased partner's net earnings from 
self-employment for such year shall also include so much of the deceased 
partner's distributive share of partnership ordinary income or loss (see 
subparagraph (3) of this paragraph) for the taxable year of the 
partnership in which his death occurs as is attributable to an interest 
in the partnership prior to the month following the month of his death.
    (2) Computation. (i) The deceased partner's distributive share of 
partnership ordinary income or loss for the partnership taxable year in 
which he died shall be determined by applying the rules contained in 
paragraphs (d) to (g), inclusive, of Sec. 1.1402(a)-2, except that 
paragraph (e) shall not apply.
    (ii) The portion of such distributive share to be included under 
this section in the deceased partner's net earnings from self-employment 
for his last taxable year shall be determined by treating the ordinary 
income or loss constituting such distributive share as having been 
realized or sustained ratably over the period of the partnership taxable 
year during which the deceased partner had an interest in the 
partnership and during which his estate, or any other person succeeding 
by reason of his death to rights with respect to his partnership 
interest, held such interest in the partnership or held a right with 
respect to such interest. The amount to be included under this section 
in the deceased partner's net earnings from self-employment for his last 
taxable year will, therefore, be determined by multiplying the deceased 
partner's distributive share of partnership ordinary income or loss for 
the partnership taxable year in which he died, as determined under 
subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, by a fraction,

[[Page 51]]

the denominator of which is the number of calendar months in the 
partnership taxable year over which the ordinary income or loss 
constituting the deceased partner's distributive share of partnership 
income or loss for such year is treated as having been realized or 
sustained under the preceding sentence and the numerator of which is the 
number of calendar months in such partnership taxable year that precede 
the month following the month of his death.
    (3) Definition of ``deceased partner's distributive share''. For the 
purpose of this section, the term ``deceased partner's distributive 
share'' includes the distributive share of his estate or of any other 
person succeeding, by reason of his death, to rights with respect to his 
partnership interest. It does not include any share attributable to a 
partnership interest which was not held by the deceased partner at the 
time of his death. Thus, if a deceased partner's estate should acquire 
an interest in a partnership additional to the interest to which it 
succeeded upon the death of the deceased partner, the amount of the 
distributive share attributable to such additional interest acquired by 
the estate would not be included in computing the ``deceased partner's 
distributive share'' of the partnership's ordinary income or loss for 
the partnership taxable year.
    (4) Examples. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated 
by the following examples:

    Example (1). B, an individual who files his income tax returns on 
the calendar year basis, is a member of the ABC partnership, the taxable 
year of which ends on June 30. B dies on October 17, 1958, and his 
estate succeeds to his partnership interest and continues as a partner 
in its own right under local law until June 30, 1959. B's distributive 
share of the partnership's ordinary income, as determined under 
paragraphs (d) to (g), inclusive, of Sec. 1.1402(a)-2, for the taxable 
year of the partnership ended June 30, 1958 is $2,400. His distributive 
share, including the share of his estate, of such partnership's ordinary 
income, as determined under paragraphs (d) to (g), inclusive, of Sec. 
1.1402(a)-2 (with the exception of paragraph (e)), for the taxable year 
of the partnership ended June 30, 1959 is $4,500. The portion of such 
$4,500 attributable to an interest in the partnership prior to the month 
following the month in which he died is $4,500x4/12 (4 being the number 
of months in the partnership taxable year in which B died which precede 
the month following the month of his death and 12 being the number of 
months in such partnership taxable year in which B and his estate had an 
interest in the partnership) or $1,500. The amount to be included in the 
deceased partner's net earnings from self-employment for his last 
taxable year is $3,900 ($2,400 plus $1,500).
    Example (2). If in the preceding example B's estate is entitled to 
only $1,000, the amount of B's distributive share of partnership 
ordinary income for the period July 1, 1958 through October 17, 1958, 
such $1,000 is considered to have been realized ratably over the period 
preceding B's death and will be included in B's net earnings from self-
employment for his last taxable year.
    Example (3). X, who reports his income on a calendar year basis, is 
a member of a partnership which also reports its income on a calendar 
year basis. X dies on June 30, 1959, and his estate succeeds to his 
partnership interest and continues as a partner in its own right under 
local law. On September 15, 1959, X's estate sells the partnership 
interest to which it succeeded on the death of X. X's distributive share 
of partnership income for 1959 is $5,500. $600 of such amount is X's 
share of the gain from the sale of a capital asset which occurs on May 
1, 1959, and $400 of such amount is the estate's share of the gain from 
the sale of a capital asset which occurs on July 15, 1959. The remainder 
of such amount is income from services rendered. X's distributive share 
of partnership ordinary income for 1959, as determined under paragraphs 
(d) to (g), inclusive, of Sec. 1.1402(a)-2 (with the exception of 
paragraph (e)), is $4,500 ($5,500 minus $1,000). The portion of such 
share attributable to an interest in the partnership prior to the month 
following the month of his death is $4,500x6/8.5 (6 being the number of 
months in the partnership taxable year in which X died as precede the 
month following the month of his death and 8.5 being the number of 
months in such partnership taxable year in which X and his estate had an 
interest in the partnership) or $3,176.47.

    (b) Options available to farmers--(1) Special rule. In determining 
whether the optional method available to a member of a farm partnership 
in computing his net earnings from self-employment may be applied, and 
in applying such method, it is necessary to determine the partner's 
distributive share of partnership gross income and the partner's 
distributive share of income described in section 702(a)(9). See section 
1402(a) and Sec. 1.1402(a)-15. If section 1402(f) and this section 
apply, or

[[Page 52]]

may be made applicable under section 403(b)(2) of the Social Security 
Amendments of 1958 and paragraph (c) of this section, for the last 
taxable year of a deceased partner, such partner's distributive share of 
income described in section 702(a)(9) for his last taxable year shall be 
determined by including therein any amount which is included under 
section 1402(f) and this section in his net earnings from self-
employment for such taxable year. Such a partner's distributive share of 
partnership gross income for his last taxable year shall be determined 
by including therein so much of the deceased partner's distributive 
share (see paragraph (a)(3) of this section) of partnership gross 
income, as defined in section 1402(a) and paragraph (b) of Sec. 
1.1402(a)-15, for the partnership taxable year in which he died as is 
attributable to an interest in the partnership prior to the month 
following the month of his death. Such allocation shall be made in the 
same manner as is prescribed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section for 
determining the portion of a deceased partner's distributive share of 
partnership ordinary income or loss to be included under section 1402(f) 
and this section in his net earnings from self-employment for his last 
taxable year.
    (2) Examples. The principles set forth in this paragraph may be 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example (1). X, an individual who files his income tax returns on a 
calendar year basis, is a member of the XYZ farm partnership, the 
taxable year of which ends on March 31. X dies on May 31, 1967, and his 
estate succeeds to his partnership interest and continues as a partner 
in its own right under local law until March 31, 1968. X's distributive 
share of the partnership's ordinary income, determined under paragraphs 
(d) to (g), inclusive, of Sec. 1.1402(a)-2, for the taxable year of the 
partnership ended March 31, 1967, is $1,600. His distributive share, 
including the share of his estate, of such partnership's ordinary loss 
as determined under paragraphs (d) to (g), inclusive, of Sec. 
1.1402(a)-2 (with the exception of paragraph (e)), for the taxable year 
of the partnership ended March 31, 1968, is $1,200. The portion of such 
$1,200 attributable to an interest in the partnership prior to the month 
following the month in which he died is $1,200x2/12 (2 being the number 
of months in the partnership taxable year in which X died which precede 
the month following the month of his death and 12 being the number of 
months in such partnership taxable year in which X and his estate had an 
interest in the partnership) or $200. X is also a member of the ABX farm 
partnership, the taxable year of which ends on May 31. His distributive 
share of the partnership loss described in section 702(a)(9) for the 
partnership taxable year ending May 31, 1967, is $300. Section 1402(f) 
and this section do not apply with respect to such $300 since X's last 
taxable year ends, as a result of his death, with the taxable year of 
the ABX partnership. Under this paragraph the $200 loss must be included 
in determining X's distributive share of XYZ partnership income 
described in section 702(a)(9) for the purpose of applying the optional 
method available to farmers for computing net earnings from self-
employment. Further, the resulting $1,400 of income must be aggregated, 
pursuant to paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.1402(a)-15, with the $300 loss, X's 
distributive share of ABX partnership loss described in section 
702(a)(9), for purposes of applying such option. The representative of 
X's estate may exercise the option described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of 
Sec. 1.1402(a)-15, provided the portion of X's distributive share of 
XYZ partnership gross income for the taxable year ended March 31, 1968, 
attributable to an interest in the partnership prior to the month 
following the month in which he died (the allocation being made in the 
manner prescribed for allocating his $1,200 distributive share of XYZ 
partnership loss for such year), when aggregated with his distributive 
share of XYZ partnership gross income for the partnership taxable year 
ended March 31, 1967, and with his distributive share of ABX partnership 
gross income for the partnership taxable year ended May 31, 1967, 
results in X having more than $2,400 of gross income from the trade or 
business of farming. If such aggregate amount of gross income is not 
more than $2,400, the option described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of Sec. 
1.1402(a)-15, is available.
    Example (2). A, a sole proprietor engaged in the business of 
farming, files his income tax returns on a calendar year basis. A is 
also a member of a partnership engaged in an agricultural activity. The 
partnership files its returns on the basis of a fiscal year ending March 
31. A dies June 29, 1967. A's gross income from farming as a sole 
proprietor for the 6-month period comprising his taxable year which ends 
because of death is $1,600 and his actual net earnings from self-
employment based thereon are $400. As of March 31, 1967, A's 
distributive share of the gross income of the farm partnership is $2,200 
and his distributive share of income described in section 702(a)(9) 
based thereon is $1,000. The amount of A's distributive share of the 
partnership's ordinary income for its taxable year ended March 31, 1968, 
which may be included in his net earnings from self-employment under 
section 1402(f) and paragraph (a) of this section is $300. The

[[Page 53]]

amount of the deceased partner's distributive share of partnership gross 
income attributable to an interest in the partnership prior to the month 
following the month of his death as is determined, pursuant to 
subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, under paragraph (a) of this section 
is $2,000. An aggregation of the above figures produces a gross income 
from farming of $5,800 and actual net earnings from self-employment of 
$1,700. Under these circumstances none of the options provided by 
section 1402(a) may be used. If the actual net earnings from self-
employment had been less than $1,600, the option described in paragraph 
(a)(2)(ii) of Sec. 1.1402(a)-15 would have been available.

    (c) Taxable years ending after 1955 and on or before August 28, 
1958--(1) Requirement of election. If a partner's taxable year ended, as 
a result of his death, after 1955 and on or before August 28, 1958, the 
rules set forth in paragraph (a) of this section may be made applicable 
in computing the deceased partner's net earnings from self-employment 
for his last taxable year provided that:
    (i) Before January 1, 1960, there is filed, by the person designated 
in section 6012(b)(1) and paragraph (b)(1) of Sec. 1.6012-3, a return 
(or amended return) of the tax imposed by chapter 2 for the taxable year 
ending as a result of death, and
    (ii) Such return, if filed solely for the purpose of reporting net 
earnings from self-employment resulting from the enactment of section 
1402(f), is accompanied by the amount of tax attributable to such net 
earnings.
    (2) Administrative rule of special application. Notwithstanding the 
provisions of sections 6601, 6651, and 6653 (see such sections and the 
regulations thereunder) no interest or penalty shall be assessed or 
collected on the amount of any self-employment tax due solely by reason 
of the operation of section 1402(f) in the case of an individual who 
died after 1955 and before August 29, 1958.

[T.D. 6691, 28 FR 12796, Dec. 3, 1963, as amended by T.D. 6993, 34 FR 
830, Jan. 18, 1969]


<R05>
Sec. 1.1402(g)-1  Treatment of certain remuneration erroneously reported 
as net earnings from self-employment.

    (a) General rule. If an amount is erroneously paid as self-
employment tax, for any taxable year ending after 1954 and before 1962, 
with respect to remuneration for service (other than service described 
in section 3121(b)(8)(A)) performed in the employ of an organization 
described in section 501(c)(3) and exempt from income tax under section 
501(a), and if such remuneration is reported as self-employment income 
on a return filed on or before the due date prescribed for filing such 
return (including any extension thereof), the individual who paid such 
amount (or a fiduciary acting for such individual or his estate, or his 
survivor (within the meaning of section 205(c)(1)(C) of the Social 
Security Act)), may request that such remuneration be deemed to 
constitute net earnings from self-employment. If such request is filed 
during the period September 14, 1960, to April 16, 1962, inclusive, and 
on or after the date on which the organization which paid such 
remuneration to such individual for services performed in its employ has 
filed, pursuant to section 3121(k), a certificate waiving exemption from 
taxes under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, and if no credit or 
refund of any portion of the amount erroneously paid for such taxable 
year as self-employment tax (other than a credit or refund which would 
be allowable if such tax were applicable with respect to such 
remuneration) has been obtained before the date on which such request is 
filed or, if obtained, the amount credited or refunded (including any 
interest under section 6611) is repaid on or before such date, then, for 
purposes of the Self-Employment Contributions Act of 1954 and the 
Federal Insurance Contributions Act, any amount of such remuneration 
which is paid to such individual before the calendar quarter in which 
such request is filed (or before the succeeding quarter if such 
certificate first becomes effective with respect to services performed 
by such individual in such succeeding quarter) and with respect to which 
no tax (other than an amount erroneously paid as tax) has been paid 
under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, shall be deemed to 
constitute net earnings from self-employment and not remuneration for 
employment. If the certificate filed by such organization pursuant to 
section

[[Page 54]]

3121(k) is not effective with respect to services performed by such 
individual on or before the first day of the calendar quarter in which 
the request is filed, then, for purposes of section 3121(b)(8)(B) (ii) 
and (iii), such individual shall be deemed to have become an employee of 
such organization (or to have become a member of a group, described in 
section 3121(k)(1)(E), of employees of such organization) on the first 
day of the succeeding quarter.
    (b) Request for validation. (1) No particular form is prescribed for 
making a request under paragraph (a) of this section. The request should 
be in writing, should be signed and dated by the person making the 
request, and should indicate clearly that it is a request that, pursuant 
to section 1402(g) of the Code, remuneration for service described in 
section 3121(b)(8) (other than service described in section 
3121(b)(8)(A)) erroneously reported as self-employment income for one or 
more specified years be deemed to constitute net earnings from self-
employment and not remuneration for employment. In addition, the 
following information shall be shown in connection with the request:
    (i) The name, address, and social security account number of the 
individual with respect to whose remuneration the request is made.
    (ii) The taxable year or years (ending after 1954 and before 1962) 
to which the request relates.
    (iii) A statement that the remuneration was erroneously reported as 
self- employment income on the individual's return for each year 
specified and that the return was filed on or before its due date 
(including any extension thereof).
    (iv) Location of the office of the district director with whom each 
return was filed.
    (v) A statement that no portion of the amount erroneously paid by 
the individual as self-employment tax with respect to the remuneration 
has been credited or refunded (other than a credit or refund which would 
have been allowable if the tax had been applicable with respect to the 
remuneration); or, if a credit or refund of any portion of such amount 
has been obtained, a statement identifying the credit or refund and 
showing how and when the amount credited or refunded, together with any 
interest received in connection therewith, was repaid.
    (vi) The name and address of the organization which paid the 
remuneration to the individual.
    (vii) The date on which the organization filed a waiver certificate 
on Form SS-15, and the location of the office of the district director 
with whom it was filed.
    (viii) The date on which the certificate became effective with 
respect to services performed by the individual.
    (ix) If the request is made by a person other than the individual to 
whom the remuneration was paid, the name and address of that person and 
evidence which shows the authority of such person to make the request.
    (2) The request should be filed with the district director of 
internal revenue with whom the latest of the returns specified in the

    (a) In general. An individual--(1) Who is a member of a recognized 
religious sect or division thereof and,
    (2) Who is an adherent of established tenets or teachings of such 
sect or division and by reason thereof is conscientiously opposed to 
acceptance of the benefits of any private or public insurance which

or makes payments toward the cost of, or provides services for, medical 
care (including the benefits of any insurance system established by the 
Social Security Act),

may file an application for exemption from the tax under section 1401. 
The form of insurance to which section 1402(h) and this section refer 
does not include liability insurance of a kind that provides only for 
the protection of

[[Page 55]]

other persons, or property of other persons, who may be injured or 
damaged by or on property belonging to, or by an action of, an 
individual who otherwise meets the requirements of this section. An 
application for exemption under section 1402(h) and this section shall 
be made in the manner provided in paragraph (b) of this section and 
within the time specified in paragraph (c) of this section. For 
provisions relating to the filing of an application for exemption by a 
fiduciary or survivor, see paragraph (d) of this section.
    (b) Application for exemption. The application for exemption shall 
be filed on Form 4029 in duplicate with the internal revenue official or 
office designated on the form. The filing of a return by a member of a 
religious group opposed to insurance showing no self-employment income 
or self-employment tax shall not be construed as an application for 
exemption referred to in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Time limitation for filing application for exemption--(1) 
Taxable years ending before December 31, 1967. A member of a religious 
group opposed to insurance within the meaning of paragraph (a) of this 
section:
    (i) Who has self-employment income (determined without regard to 
subsections (c)(6) and (h) of section 1402 and this section) for one or 
more taxable years ending before December 31, 1967, and
    (ii) Who desires to be exempt from the payment of the self-
employment tax under section 1401,

must file the application for exemption on or before December 31, 1968.
    (2) Taxable year ending on or after December 31, 1967--(i) General 
rule. Except as provided in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, a 
member of a religious group opposed to insurance within the meaning of 
paragraph (a) of this section:
    (a) Who has no self-employment income (determined without regard to 
subsections (c)(6) and (h) of section 1402 and this section) for any 
taxable year ending before December 31, 1967, and
    (b) Who desires to be exempt from the payment of the self-employment 
tax under section 1401 for any taxable year ending on or after December 
31, 1967,

must file the application for exemption on or before the due date of the 
income tax return (see section 6072), including any extension thereof 
(see section 6081), for the first taxable year ending on or after 
December 31, 1967, for which he has self-employment income (determined 
without regard to subsections (c)(6) and (h) of section 1402 and this 
section.
    (ii) Exception to general rule. If an individual to whom subdivision 
(i) of this subparagraph applies:
    (a) Is notified in writing by a district director of internal 
revenue or the Director of International Operations that he has not 
filed the application for exemption on or before the date specified in 
such subdivision (i), and
    (b) Files the application for exemption on or before the last day of 
the third calendar month following the calendar month in which he is so 
notified,

such application shall be considered a timely filed application for 
exemption.
    (d) Application by fiduciary or survivor. If an individual who was a 
member of a religious group opposed to insurance dies before the 
expiration of the time prescribed in section 1402(h)(2) and paragraph 
(c) of this section during which an application could have been filed by 
him, an application for exemption with respect to such deceased 
individual may be filed by a fiduciary acting for such individual's 
estate or by such individual's survivor within the meaning of section 
205(c)(1)(C) of the Social Security Act. An application for exemption 
with respect to a deceased individual executed by a fiduciary or 
survivor may be approved only if it could have been approved if the 
individual were not deceased and had filed the application on the date 
the application was filed by the fiduciary or executor.
    (e) Approval of application for exemption--(1) In general. The 
filing of an application for exemption on Form 4029 by a member of a 
religious group opposed to insurance does not constitute an exemption 
from the payment of the tax on self-employment income. An individual who 
files such an application is exempt from the payment of the tax only if 
the application is approved by the official with whom the application

[[Page 56]]

is required to be filed (see paragraph (b) of this section).
    (2) Conditions relating to approval or disapproval of application. 
An application for exemption on Form 4029 will not be approved unless 
the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare finds with respect to 
the religious sect or division thereof of which the individual filing 
the application is a member:
    (i) That the sect or division thereof has the established tenets or 
teachings by reason of which the individual applicant is conscientiously 
opposed to the benefits of insurance of the type referred to in section 
1402(h) (see paragraph (a) of this section),
    (ii) That it is the practice, and has been for a period of time 
which the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare deems to be 
substantial, for members of such sect or division thereof to make 
provisions for their dependent members which, in the judgment of such 
Secretary, is reasonable in view of the general level of living of the 
members of the sect or division thereof; and
    (iii) That the sect or division thereof has been in existence 
continuously since December 31, 1950.

In addition, an application for exemption on Form 4029 will not be 
approved if any benefit or other payment under title II of title XVIII 
of the Social Security Act became payable (or, but for section 203, 
relating to reduction of insurance benefits, or 222(b), relating to 
reduction of insurance benefits on account of refusal to accept 
rehabilitation services, of the Social Security Act would have been 
payable) at or before the time of the filing of the application for 
exemption. Any determination required to be made pursuant to the 
preceding sentence will be made by the Secretary of Health, Education, 
and Welfare.
    (f) Period for which exemption is effective--(1) General rule. An 
application for exemption shall be in effect (if approved as provided in 
paragraph (e) of this section) for all taxable years beginning after 
December 31, 1950, except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (2) of 
this paragraph.
    (2) Exceptions. An application for exemption referred to in 
subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall not be effective for any 
taxable year which:
    (i) Begins (a) before the taxable year in which the individual 
filing the application first met the requirements of subparagraphs (1) 
and (2) of paragraph (a) of this section, or (b) before the time as of 
which the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare finds that the 
sect or division thereof of which the individual is a member met the 
requirements of subparagraphs (C) and (D) of section 1402(h)(1) (see 
subdivisions (i) and (ii) of paragraph (e)(2) of this section), or
    (ii) Ends (a) after the time at which the individual filing the 
application ceases to meet the requirements of subparagraphs (1) and (2) 
of paragraph (a) of this section, or (b) after the time as of which the 
Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare finds that the sect or 
division thereof of which the individual is a member ceases to meet the 
requirements of subparagraphs (C) and (D) of section 1402(h)(1) (see 
subdivisions (i) and (ii) of paragraph (e)(2) of this section).
    (g) Refund or credit. An application for exemption on Form 4029 
filed on or before December 31, 1968 (if approved as provided in 
paragraph (e) of this section), shall constitute a claim for refund or 
credit of any tax on self-employment income under section 1401 (or under 
section 480 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939) paid or incurred in 
respect of any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1950, and 
ending before December 31, 1967, for which an exemption is granted. 
Refund or credit of any tax referred to in the preceding sentence may be 
made, pursuant to the provisions of section 501(c) of the Social 
Security Amendments of 1967 (81 Stat. 933), notwithstanding that the 
refund or credit would otherwise be prevented by operation of any law or 
rule of law. No interest shall be allowed or paid in respect of any 
refund or credit made or allowed in connection with a claim for refund 
or credit made on Form 4029.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1441-1  Requirement for the deduction and withholding of tax 
on payments to foreign persons.

    (a) Purpose and scope. This section, Sec. Sec. 1.1441-2 through 
1.1441-9, and 1.1443-1 provide rules for withholding under sections 
1441, 1442, and 1443 when a payment is made to a foreign person. This 
section provides definitions of terms used in chapter 3 of the Internal 
Revenue Code (Code) and regulations thereunder. It prescribes procedures 
to determine whether an amount must be withheld under chapter 3 of the 
Code and documentation that a withholding agent may rely upon to 
determine the status of a payee or a beneficial owner as a U.S. person 
or as a foreign person and other relevant characteristics of the payee 
that may affect a withholding agent's obligation to withhold under 
chapter 3 of the Code and the regulations thereunder. Special procedures 
regarding payments to foreign persons that act as intermediaries are 
also provided. Section 1.1441-2 defines the income subject to 
withholding

[[Page 62]]

under section 1441, 1442, and 1443 and the regulations under these 
sections. Section 1.1441-3 provides rules regarding the amount subject 
to withholding. Section 1.1441-4 provides exemptions from withholding 
for, among other things, certain income effectively connected with the 
conduct of a trade or business in the United States, including certain 
compensation for the personal services of an individual. Section 1.1441-
5 provides rules for withholding on payments made to flow-through 
entities and other similar arrangements. Section 1.1441-6 provides rules 
for claiming a reduced rate of withholding under an income tax treaty. 
Section 1.1441-7 defines the term withholding agent and provides due 
diligence rules governing a withholding agent's obligation to withhold. 
Section 1.1441-8 provides rules for relying on claims of exemption from 
withholding for payments to a foreign government, an international 
organization, a foreign central bank of issue, or the Bank for 
International Settlements. Sections 1.1441-9 and 1.1443-1 provide rules 
for relying on claims of exemption from withholding for payments to 
foreign tax exempt organizations and foreign private foundations.
    (b) General rules of withholding--(1) Requirement to withhold on 
payments to foreign persons. A withholding agent must withhold 30-
percent of any payment of an amount subject to withholding made to a 
payee that is a foreign person unless it can reliably associate the 
payment with documentation upon which it can rely to treat the payment 
as made to a payee that is a U.S. person or as made to a beneficial 
owner that is a foreign person entitled to a reduced rate of 
withholding. However, a withholding agent making a payment to a foreign 
person need not withhold where the foreign person assumes responsibility 
for withholding on the payment under chapter 3 of the Code and the 
regulations thereunder as a qualified intermediary (see paragraph (e)(5) 
of this section), as a U.S. branch of a foreign person (see paragraph 
(b)(2)(iv) of this section), as a withholding foreign partnership (see 
Sec. 1.1441-5(c)(2)(i)), or as an authorized foreign agent (see Sec. 
1.1441-7(c)(1)). This section (dealing with general rules of withholding 
and claims of foreign or U.S. status by a payee or a beneficial owner), 
and Sec. Sec. 1.1441-4, 1.1441-5, 1.1441-6, 1.1441-8, 1.1441-9, and 
1.1443-1 provide rules for determining whether documentation is required 
as a condition for reducing the rate of withholding on a payment to a 
foreign beneficial owner or to a U.S. payee and if so, the nature of the 
documentation upon which a withholding agent may rely in order to reduce 
such rate. Paragraph (b)(2) of this section prescribes the rules for 
determining who the payee is, the extent to which a payment is treated 
as made to a foreign payee, and reliable association of a payment with 
documentation. Paragraph (b)(3) of this section describes the applicable 
presumptions for determining the payee's status as U.S. or foreign and 
the payee's other characteristics (i.e., as an owner or intermediary, as 
an individual, partnership, corporation, etc.). Paragraph (b)(4) of this 
section lists the types of payments for which the 30-percent withholding 
rate may be reduced. Because the treatment of a payee as a U.S. or a 
foreign person also has consequences for purposes of making an 
information return under the provisions of chapter 61 of the Code and 
for withholding under other provisions of the Code, such as sections 
3402, 3405 or 3406, paragraph (b)(5) of this section lists applicable 
provisions outside chapter 3 of the Code that require certain payees to 
establish their foreign status (e.g., in order to be exempt from 
information reporting). Paragraph (b)(6) of this section describes the 
withholding obligations of a foreign person making a payment that it has 
received in its capacity as an intermediary. Paragraph (b)(7) of this 
section describes the liability of a withholding agent that fails to 
withhold at the required 30-percent rate in the absence of 
documentation. Paragraph (b)(8) of this section deals with adjustments 
and refunds in the case of overwithholding. Paragraph (b)(9) of this 
section deals with determining the status of the payee when the payment 
is jointly owned. See paragraph (c)(6) of this section for a definition 
of beneficial owner. See Sec. 1.1441-7(a) for a definition of 
withholding agent. See Sec. 1.1441-2(a) for the determination of an 
amount

[[Page 63]]

subject to withholding. See Sec. 1.1441-2(e) for the definition of a 
payment and when it is considered made. Except as otherwise provided, 
the provisions of this section apply only for purposes of determining a 
withholding agent's obligation to withhold under chapter 3 of the Code 
and the regulations thereunder.
    (2) Determination of payee and payee's status--(i) In general. 
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b)(2) and Sec. 1.1441-
5(c)(1) and (e)(3), a payee is the person to whom a payment is made, 
regardless of whether such person is the beneficial owner of the amount 
(as defined in paragraph (c)(6) of this section). A foreign payee is a 
payee who is a foreign person. A U.S. payee is a payee who is a U.S. 
person. Generally, the determination by a withholding agent of the U.S. 
or foreign status of a payee and of its other relevant characteristics 
(e.g., as a beneficial owner or intermediary, or as an individual, 
corporation, or flow-through entity) is made on the basis of a 
withholding certificate that is a Form W-8 or a Form 8233 (indicating 
foreign status of the payee or beneficial owner) or a Form W-9 
(indicating U.S. status of the payee). The provisions of this paragraph 
(b)(2), paragraph (b)(3) of this section, and Sec. 1.1441-5 (c), (d), 
and (e) dealing with determinations of payee and applicable presumptions 
in the absence of documentation, apply only to payments of amounts 
subject to withholding under chapter 3 of the Code (within the meaning 
of Sec. 1.1441-2(a)). Similar payee and presumption provisions are set 
forth under Sec. 1.6049-5(d) for payments of amounts that are not 
subject to withholding under chapter 3 of the Code (or the regulations 
thereunder) but that may be reportable under provisions of chapter 61 of 
the Code (and the regulations thereunder). See paragraph (d) of this 
section for documentation upon which the withholding agent may rely in 
order to treat the payee or beneficial owner as a U.S. person. See 
paragraph (e) of this section for documentation upon which the 
withholding agent may rely in order to treat the payee or beneficial 
owner as a foreign person. For applicable presumptions of status in the 
absence of documentation, see paragraph (b)(3) of this section and Sec. 
1.1441-5(d). For definitions of a foreign person and U.S. person, see 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
    (ii) Payments to a U.S. agent of a foreign person. A withholding 
agent making a payment to a U.S. person (other than to a U.S. branch 
that is treated as a U.S. person pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of 
this section) and who has actual knowledge that the U.S. person receives 
the payment as an agent of a foreign person must treat the payment as 
made to the foreign person. However, the withholding agent may treat the 
payment as made to the U.S. person if the U.S. person is a financial 
institution and the withholding agent has no reason to believe that the 
financial institution will not comply with its obligation to withhold. 
See paragraph (c)(5) of this section for the definition of a financial 
institution.
    (iii) Payments to wholly-owned entities--(A) Foreign-owned domestic 
entity. A payment to a wholly-owned domestic entity that is disregarded 
for federal tax purposes under Sec. 301.7701-2(c)(2) of this chapter as 
an entity separate from its owner and whose single owner is a foreign 
person shall be treated as a payment to the owner of the entity, subject 
to the provisions of paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section. For purposes 
of this paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A), a domestic entity means a person that 
would be treated as a U.S. person if it had an election in effect under 
Sec. 301.7701-3(c)(1)(i) of this chapter to be treated as a 
corporation. For example, a limited liability company, A, organized 
under the laws of the State of Delaware, opens an account at a U.S. 
bank. Upon opening of the account, the bank requests A to furnish a Form 
W-9 as required under section 6049(a) and the regulations under that 
section. A does not have an election in effect under Sec. 301.7701-
3(c)(1)(i) of this chapter and, therefore, is not treated as an 
organization taxable as a corporation, including for purposes of the 
exempt recipient provisions in Sec. 1.6049-4(c)(1). If A has a single 
owner and the owner is a foreign person (as defined in paragraph (c)(2) 
of this section), then A may not furnish a Form W-9 because it may not 
represent that it is a U.S. person for purposes of the provisions of 
chapters 3

[[Page 64]]

and 61 of the Code, and section 3406. Therefore, A must furnish a Form 
W-8 with the name, address, and taxpayer identifying number (TIN) (if 
required) of the foreign person who is the single owner in the same 
manner as if the account were opened directly by the foreign single 
owner. See Sec. Sec. 1.894-1T(d) and 1.1441-6(b)(2) for special rules 
where the entity's owner is claiming a reduced rate of withholding under 
an income tax treaty.
    (B) Foreign entity. A payment to a wholly-owned foreign entity that 
is disregarded under Sec. 301.7701-2(c)(2) of this chapter as an entity 
separate from its owner shall be treated as a payment to the single 
owner of the entity, subject to the provisions of paragraph (b)(2)(iv) 
of this section if the foreign entity has a U.S. branch in the United 
States. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(B), a foreign entity 
means a person that would be treated as a foreign person if it had an 
election in effect under Sec. 301.7701-3(c)(1)(i) of this chapter to be 
treated as a corporation. See Sec. Sec. 1.894-1T(d) and 1.1441-6(b)(2) 
for special rules where the foreign entity or its owner is claiming a 
reduced rate of withholding under an income tax treaty. Thus, for 
example, if the foreign entity's single owner is a U.S. person, the 
payment shall be treated as a payment to a U.S. person. Therefore, based 
on the saving clause in U.S. income tax treaties, such an entity may not 
claim benefits under an income tax treaty even if the entity is 
organized in a country with which the United States has an income tax 
treaty in effect and treats the entity as a non-fiscally transparent 
entity. See Sec. 1.894-1T(d)(6), Example 10. Unless it has actual 
knowledge or reason to know that the foreign entity to whom the payment 
is made is disregarded under Sec. 301.7701-2(c)(2) of this chapter, a 
withholding agent may treat a foreign entity as an entity separate from 
its owner unless it can reliably associate the payment with a 
withholding certificate from the entity's owner.
    (iv) Payments to a U.S. branch of certain foreign banks or foreign 
insurance companies--(A) U.S. branch treated as a U.S. person in certain 
cases. A payment to a U.S. branch of a foreign person is a payment to a 
foreign person. However, a U.S. branch described in this paragraph 
(b)(2)(iv)(A) and a withholding agent (including another U.S. branch 
described in this paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A)) may agree to treat the branch 
as a U.S. person for purposes of withholding on specified payments to 
the U.S. branch. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a withholding 
agent making a payment to a U.S. branch treated as a U.S. person under 
this paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) shall not treat the branch as a U.S. person 
for purposes of reporting the payment made to the branch. Therefore, a 
payment to such U.S. branch shall be reported on Form 1042-S under Sec. 
1.1461-1(c). Further, a U.S. branch that is treated as a U.S. person 
under this paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) shall not be treated as a U.S. person 
for purposes of the withholding certificate it may provide to a 
withholding agent. Therefore, the U.S. branch must furnish a U.S. branch 
withholding certificate on Form W-8 as provided in paragraph (e)(3)(v) 
of this section and not a Form W-9. An agreement to treat a U.S. branch 
as a U.S. person must be evidenced by a U.S. branch withholding 
certificate described in paragraph (e)(3)(v) of this section furnished 
by the U.S. branch to the withholding agent. A U.S. branch described in 
this paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) is any U.S. branch of a foreign bank 
subject to regulatory supervision by the Federal Reserve Board or a U.S. 
branch of a foreign insurance company required to file an annual 
statement on a form approved by the National Association of Insurance 
Commissioners with the Insurance Department of a State, a Territory, or 
the District of Columbia. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may approve 
a list of U.S. branches that may qualify for treatment as a U.S. person 
under this paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) (see Sec. 601.601(d)(2) of this 
chapter). See Sec. 1.6049-5(c)(5)(vi) for the treatment of U.S. 
branches as U.S. payors if they make a payment that is subject to 
reporting under chapter 61 of the Internal Revenue Code. Also see Sec. 
1.6049-5(d)(1)(ii) for the treatment of U.S. branches as foreign payees 
under chapter 61 of the Internal Revenue Code.

[[Page 65]]

    (B) Consequences to the withholding agent. Any person that is 
otherwise a withholding agent regarding a payment to a U.S. branch 
described in paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) of this section shall treat the 
payment in one of the following ways--
    (1) As a payment to a U.S. person, in which case the withholding 
agent is not responsible for withholding on such payment to the extent 
it can reliably associate the payment with a withholding certificate 
described in paragraph (e)(3)(v) of this section that has been furnished 
by the U.S. branch under its agreement with the withholding agent to be 
treated as a U.S. person;
    (2) As a payment directly to the persons whose names are on 
withholding certificates or other appropriate documentation forwarded by 
the U.S. branch to the withholding agent when no agreement is in effect 
to treat the U.S. branch as a U.S. person for such payment, to the 
extent the withholding agent can reliably associate the payment with 
such certificates or documentation; or
    (3) As a payment to a foreign person of income that is effectively 
connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States 
if the withholding agent cannot reliably associate the payment with a 
withholding certificate from the U.S. branch or any other certificate or 
other appropriate documentation from another person. See Sec. 1.1441-
4(a)(2)(ii).
    (C) Consequences to the U.S. branch. A U.S. branch that is treated 
as a U.S. person under paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) of this section shall be 
treated as a separate person solely for purposes of section 1441(a) and 
all other provisions of chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code and the 
regulations thereunder (other than for purposes of reporting the payment 
to the U.S. branch under Sec. 1.1461-1(c) or for purposes of the 
documentation such a branch must furnish under paragraph (e)(3)(v) of 
this section) for any payment that it receives as such. Thus, the U.S. 
branch shall be responsible for withholding on the payment in accordance 
with the provisions under chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code and the 
regulations thereunder and other applicable withholding provisions of 
the Internal Revenue Code. For this purpose, it shall obtain and retain 
documentation from payees or beneficial owners of the payments that it 
receives as a U.S. person in the same manner as if it were a separate 
entity. For example, if a U.S. branch receives a payment on behalf of 
its home office and the home office is a qualified intermediary, the 
U.S. branch must obtain a qualified intermediary withholding certificate 
described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section from its home office. 
In addition, a U.S. branch that has not provided documentation to the 
withholding agent for a payment that is, in fact, not effectively 
connected income is a withholding agent with respect to that payment. 
See paragraph (b)(6) of this section and Sec. 1.1441-4(a)(2)(ii).
    (D) Definition of payment to a U.S. branch. A payment is treated as 
a payment to a U.S. branch of a foreign bank or foreign insurance 
company if the payment is credited to an account maintained in the 
United States in the name of a U.S. branch of the foreign person, or the 
payment is made to an address in the United States where the U.S. branch 
is located and the name of the U.S. branch appears on documents (in 
written or electronic form) associated with the payment (e.g., the check 
mailed or a letter addressed to the branch).
    (E) Payments to other U.S. branches. Similar withholding procedures 
may apply to payments to U.S. branches that are not described in 
paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) of this section to the extent permitted by the 
district director or the Assistant Commissioner (International). Any 
such branch must establish that its situation is analogous to that of a 
U.S. branch described in paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) of this section 
regarding its registration with, and regulation by, a U.S. governmental 
institution, the type and amounts of assets it is required to, or 
actually maintains in the United States, and the personnel who carry out 
the activities of the branch in the United States. In the alternative, 
the branch must establish that the withholding and reporting 
requirements under chapter 3 of the Code and the regulations thereunder 
impose an undue administrative burden and

[[Page 66]]

that the collection of the tax imposed by section 871(a) or 881(a) on 
the foreign person (or its members in the case of a foreign partnership) 
will not be jeopardized by the exemption from withholding. Generally, an 
undue administrative burden will be found to exist in a case where the 
person entitled to the income, such as a foreign insurance company, 
receives from the withholding agent income on securities issued by a 
single corporation, some of which is, and some of which is not, 
effectively connected with conduct of a trade or business within the 
United States and the criteria for determining the effective connection 
are unduly difficult to apply because of the circumstances under which 
such securities are held. No exemption from withholding shall be granted 
under this paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(E) unless the person entitled to the 
income complies with such other requirements as may be imposed by the 
district director or the Assistant Commissioner (International) and 
unless the district director or the Assistant Commissioner 
(International) is satisfied that the collection of the tax on the 
income involved will not be jeopardized by the exemption from 
withholding. The IRS may prescribe such procedures as are necessary to 
make these determinations (see Sec. 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter).
    (v) Payments to a foreign intermediary--(A) Payments treated as made 
to persons for whom the intermediary collects the payment. Except as 
otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(2)(v)(B) of this section, the payee 
of a payment to a person that the withholding agent may treat as a 
foreign intermediary in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 
(b)(3)(ii)(C) or (b)(3)(v)(A) of this section is the person or persons 
for whom the intermediary collects the payment. Thus, for example, the 
payee of a payment that the withholding agent can reliably associate 
with a withholding certificate from a qualified intermediary (defined in 
paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of this section) that does not assume primary 
withholding responsibility or a payment to a nonqualified intermediary 
are the persons for whom the qualified intermediary or nonqualified 
intermediary acts and not to the intermediary itself. See paragraph 
(b)(3)(v) of this section for presumptions that apply if the payment 
cannot be reliably associated with valid documentation. For similar 
rules for payments to flow-through entities, see Sec. 1.1441-5(c)(1) 
and (e)(3).
    (B) Payments treated as made to foreign intermediary. The payee of a 
payment to a person that the withholding agent may treat as a qualified 
intermediary is the qualified intermediary to the extent that the 
qualified intermediary assumes primary withholding responsibility under 
paragraph (e)(5)(iv) of this section for the payment. For example if a 
qualified intermediary assumes primary withholding responsibility under 
chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code but does not assume primary 
reporting or withholding responsibility under chapter 61 or section 3406 
of the Internal Revenue Code and therefore provides Forms W-9 for U.S. 
non-exempt recipients, the qualified intermediary is the payee except to 
the extent the payment is reliably associated with a Form W-9 from a 
U.S. non-exempt recipient.
    (vi) Other payees. A payment to a person described in Sec. 1.6049-
4(c)(1)(ii) that the withholding agent would treat as a payment to a 
foreign person without obtaining documentation for purposes of 
information reporting under section 6049 (if the payment were interest) 
is treated as a payment to a foreign payee for purposes of chapter 3 of 
the Code and the regulations thereunder (or to a foreign beneficial 
owner to the extent provided in paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(A) (6) or (7) of 
this section). Further, payments that the withholding agent can reliably 
associate with documentary evidence described in Sec. 1.6049-5(c)(1) 
relating to the payee is treated as a payment to a foreign payee. A 
payment that the withholding agent may treat as a payment to an 
authorized foreign agent (as defined in Sec. 1.1441-7(c)(2)) is treated 
as a payment to the agent and not to the persons for whom the agent 
collects the payment. See Sec. 1.1441-5 (b)(1) and (c)(1) for payee 
determinations for payments to partnerships. See Sec. 1.1441-5(e) for 
payee determinations for payments to foreign trusts or foreign estates.
    (vii) Rules for reliably associating a payment with a withholding 
certificate or

[[Page 67]]

other appropriate documentation--(A) Generally. The presumption rules of 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section and Sec. Sec. 1.1441-5(d) and (e)(6) 
and 1.6049-5(d) apply to any payment, or portion of a payment, that a 
withholding agent cannot reliably associate with valid documentation. 
Generally, a withholding agent can reliably associate a payment with 
valid documentation if, prior to the payment, it holds valid 
documentation (either directly or through an agent), it can reliably 
determine how much of the payment relates to the valid documentation, 
and it has no actual knowledge or reason to know that any of the 
information, certifications, or statements in, or associated with, the 
documentation are incorrect. Special rules apply for payments made to 
intermediaries, flow-through entities, and certain U.S. branches. See 
paragraph (b)(2)(vii)(B) through (F) of this section. The documentation 
referred to in this paragraph (b)(2)(vii) is documentation described in 
paragraphs (c)(16) and (17) of this section upon which a withholding 
agent may rely to treat the payment as a payment made to a payee or 
beneficial owner, and to ascertain the characteristics of the payee or 
beneficial owner that are relevant to withholding or reporting under 
chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder. 
For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(vii), documentation also includes 
the agreement that the withholding agent has in effect with an 
authorized foreign agent in accordance with Sec. 1.1441-7(c)(2)(i). A 
withholding agent that is not required to obtain documentation with 
respect to a payment is considered to lack documentation for purposes of 
this paragraph (b)(2)(vii). For example, a withholding agent paying U.S. 
source interest to a person that is an exempt recipient, as defined in 
Sec. 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii), is not required to obtain documentation from 
that person in order to determine whether an amount paid to that person 
is reportable under an applicable information reporting provision under 
chapter 61 of the Internal Revenue Code. The withholding agent must, 
however, treat the payment as made to an undocumented person for 
purposes of chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code. Therefore, the 
presumption rules of paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section apply to 
determine whether the person is presumed to be a U.S. person (in which 
case, no withholding is required under this section), or whether the 
person is presumed to be a foreign person (in which case 30-percent 
withholding is required under this section). See paragraph (b)(3)(v) of 
this section for special reliance rules in the case of a payment to a 
foreign intermediary and Sec. 1.1441-5(d) and (e)(6) for special 
reliance rules in the case of a payment to a flow-through entity.
    (B) Special rules applicable to a withholding certificate from a 
nonqualified intermediary or flow-through entity. (1) In the case of a 
payment made to a nonqualified intermediary, a flow-through entity (as 
defined in paragraph (c)(23) of this section), and a U.S. branch 
described in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section (other than a branch 
that is treated as a U.S. person), a withholding agent can reliably 
associate the payment with valid documentation only to the extent that, 
prior to the payment, the withholding agent can allocate the payment to 
a valid nonqualified intermediary, flow-through, or U.S. branch 
withholding certificate; the withholding agent can reliably determine 
how much of the payment relates to valid documentation provided by a 
payee as determined under paragraph (c)(12) of this section (i.e., a 
person that is not itself an intermediary, flow-through entity, or U.S. 
branch); and the withholding agent has sufficient information to report 
the payment on Form 1042-S or Form 1099, if reporting is required. See 
paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section for the requirements of a 
nonqualified intermediary withholding certificate, paragraph (e)(3)(v) 
of this section for the requirements of a U.S. branch certificate, and 
Sec. Sec. 1.1441-5(c)(3)(iii) and (e)(5)(iii) for the requirements of a 
flow-through withholding certificate. Thus, a payment cannot be reliably 
associated with valid documentation provided by a payee to the extent 
such documentation is lacking or unreliable, or to the extent that 
information required to allocate and report all or a portion of the 
payment to each payee

[[Page 68]]

is lacking or unreliable. If a withholding certificate attached to an 
intermediary, U.S. branch, or flow-through withholding certificate is 
another intermediary, U.S. branch, or flow-through withholding 
certificate, the rules of this paragraph (b)(2)(vii)(B) apply by 
treating the share of the payment allocable to the other intermediary, 
U.S. branch, or flow-through entity as if the payment were made directly 
to such other entity. See paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(D) of this section for 
rules permitting information allocating a payment to documentation to be 
received after the payment is made.
    (2) The rules of paragraph (b)(2)(vii)(B)(1) of this section are 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. WH, a withholding agent, makes a payment of U.S. source 
interest to NQI, an intermediary that is a nonqualified intermediary. 
NQI provides a valid intermediary withholding certificate under 
paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section. NQI does not, however, provide 
valid documentation from the persons on whose behalf it receives the 
interest payment, and, therefore, the interest payment cannot be 
reliably associated with valid documentation provided by a payee. WH 
must apply the presumption rules of paragraph (b)(3)(v) of this section 
to the payment.
    Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that NQI 
does attach valid beneficial owner withholding certificates (as defined 
in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section) from A, B, C, and D establishing 
their status as foreign persons. NQI does not, however, provide WH with 
any information allocating the payment among A, B, C, and D and, 
therefore, WH cannot determine the portion of the payment that relates 
to each beneficial owner withholding certificate. The interest payment 
cannot be reliably associated with valid documentation from a payee and 
WH must apply the presumption rules of paragraph (b)(3)(v) of this 
section to the payment. See, however, paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(D) of this 
section providing special rules permitting allocation information to be 
received after a payment is made.
    Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example 2, except that NQI 
does provide allocation information associated with its intermediary 
withholding certificate indicating that 25 percent of the interest 
payment is allocable to A and 25 percent to B. NQI does not provide any 
allocation information regarding the remaining 50 percent of the 
payment. WH may treat 25 percent of the payment as made to A and 25 
percent as made to B. The remaining 50 percent of the payment cannot be 
reliably associated with valid documentation from a payee, however, 
since NQI did not provide information allocating the payment. Thus, the 
remaining 50 percent of the payment is subject to the presumption rules 
of paragraph (b)(3)(v) of this section.
    Example 4. WH makes a payment of U.S. source interest to NQI1, an 
intermediary that is not a qualified intermediary. NQI1 provides WH with 
a valid nonqualified intermediary withholding certificate as well a 
valid beneficial owner withholding certificates from A and B and a valid 
nonqualified intermediary withholding certificate from NQI2. NQI2 has 
provided valid beneficial owner documentation from C sufficient to 
establish C's status as a foreign person. Based on information provided 
by NQI1, WH can allocate 20 percent of the interest payment to A, and 20 
percent to B. Based on information that NQI2 provided NQI1 and that NQI1 
provides to WH, WH can allocate 60 percent of the payment to NQI 2, but 
can only allocate one half of that payment (30 percent) to C. Therefore, 
WH cannot reliably associate 30 percent of the payment made to NQI2 with 
valid documentation and must apply the presumption rules of paragraph 
(b)(3)(v) of this section to that portion of the payment.

    (C) Special rules applicable to a withholding certificate provided 
by a qualified intermediary that does not assume primary withholding 
responsibility. (1) If a payment is made to a qualified intermediary 
that does not assume primary withholding responsibility under chapter 3 
of the Internal Revenue Code or primary Form 1099 reporting and backup 
withholding responsibility under chapter 61 and section 3406 of the 
Internal Revenue Code for the payment, a withholding agent can reliably 
associate the payment with valid documentation only to the extent that, 
prior to the payment, the withholding agent has received a valid 
qualified intermediary withholding certificate and the withholding agent 
can reliably determine the portion of the payment that relates to a 
withholding rate pool, as defined in paragraph (e)(5)(v)(C) of this 
section. In the case of a withholding rate pool attributable to a U.S. 
non-exempt recipient, a payment cannot be reliably associated with valid 
documentation unless, prior to the payment, the qualified intermediary 
has provided the U.S. person's Form W-9 (or, in the absence of the form, 
the name, address, and TIN, if available, of

[[Page 69]]

the U.S. person) and sufficient information for the withholding agent to 
report the payment on Form 1099. See paragraph (e)(5)(v)(C)(2) of this 
section for special rules regarding allocation of payments among U.S. 
non-exempt recipients.
    (2) The rules of this paragraph (b)(2)(vii)(C) are illustrated by 
the following examples:

    Example 1. WH, a withholding agent, makes a payment of U.S. source 
dividends to QI. QI provides WH with a valid qualified intermediary 
withholding certificate on which it indicates that it does not assume 
primary withholding responsibility under chapter 3 of the Internal 
Revenue Code or primary Form 1099 reporting and backup withholding 
responsibility under chapter 61 and section 3406 of the Internal Revenue 
Code. QI does not provide any information allocating the dividend to 
withholding rate pools. WH cannot reliably associate the payment with 
valid payee documentation and therefore must apply the presumption rules 
of paragraph (b)(3)(v) of this section.
    Example 2. WH makes a payment of U.S. source dividends to QI. QI has 
5 customers: A, B, C, D, and E. QI has obtained documentation from A and 
B establishing their entitlement to a 15 percent rate of tax on U.S. 
source dividends under an income tax treaty. C is a U.S. person that is 
an exempt recipient as defined in paragraph (c)(20) of this section. D 
and E are U.S. non-exempt recipients who have provided Forms W-9 to QI. 
A, B, C, D, and E are each entitled to 20 percent of the dividend 
payment. QI provides WH with a valid qualified intermediary withholding 
certificate as described in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section with 
which it associates the Forms W-9 from D and E. QI associates the 
following allocation information with its qualified intermediary 
withholding certificate: 40 percent of the payment is allocable to the 
15 percent withholding rate pool, and 20 percent is allocable to each of 
D and E. QI does not provide any allocation information regarding the 
remaining 20 percent of the payment. WH cannot reliably associate 20 
percent of the payment with valid documentation and, therefore, must 
apply the presumption rules of paragraph (b)(3)(v) of this section to 
that portion of the payment. The 20 percent of the payment allocable to 
the 15 percent withholding rate pool, and the portion of the payments 
allocable to D and E are payments that can be reliably associated with 
documentation.

    (D) Special rules applicable to a withholding certificate provided 
by a qualified intermediary that assumes primary withholding 
responsibility under chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code. (1) In the 
case of a payment made to a qualified intermediary that assumes primary 
withholding responsibility under chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code 
with respect to that payment (but does not assume primary Form 1099 
reporting and backup withholding responsibility under chapter 61 and 
section 3406 of the Internal Revenue Code), a withholding agent can 
reliably associate the payment with valid documentation only to the 
extent that, prior to the payment, the withholding agent has received a 
valid qualified intermediary withholding certificate and the withholding 
agent can reliably determine the portion of the payment that relates to 
the withholding rate pool for which the qualified intermediary assumes 
primary withholding responsibility under chapter 3 of the Internal 
Revenue Code and the portion of the payment attributable to withholding 
rate pools for each U.S. non-exempt recipient for whom the qualified 
intermediary has provided a Form W-9 (or, in absence of the form, the 
name, address, and TIN, if available, of the U.S. non-exempt recipient). 
See paragraph (e)(5)(v)(C)(2) of this section for alternative allocation 
procedures for payments made to U.S. persons that are not exempt 
recipients.
    (2) Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of 
paragraph (b)(2)(vii)(D)(1) of this section:

    Example 1. WH makes a payment of U.S. source interest to QI, a 
qualified intermediary. QI provides WH with a withholding certificate 
that indicates that QI will assume primary withholding responsibility 
under chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code with respect to the 
payment. In addition, QI attaches a Form W-9 from A, a U.S. non-exempt 
recipient, as defined in paragraph (c)(21) of this section, and provides 
the name, address, and TIN of B, a U.S. person that is also a non-exempt 
recipient but who has not provided a Form W-9. QI associates a 
withholding statement with its qualified intermediary withholding 
certificate indicating that 10 percent of the payment is attributable to 
A, and 10 percent to B, and that QI will assume primary withholding 
responsibility with respect to the remaining 80 percent of the payment. 
WH can reliably associate the entire payment with valid documentation. 
Although under the presumption rule of paragraph (b)(3)(v) of this 
section, an undocumented person receiving U.S. source interest is 
generally presumed to be a foreign person, WH has actual knowledge that 
B is a U.S. non-exempt recipient and therefore

[[Page 70]]

must report the payment on Form 1099 and backup withhold on the interest 
payment under section 3406.
    Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that no 
Forms W-9 or other information have been provided for the 20 percent of 
the payment that is allocable to A and B. Thus, QI has accepted 
withholding responsibility for 80 percent of the payment, but has 
provided no information for the remaining 20 percent. In this case, 20 
percent of the payment cannot be reliably associated with valid 
documentation, and WH must apply the presumption rule of paragraph 
(b)(3)(v) of this section.

    (E) Special rules applicable to a withholding certificate provided 
by a qualified intermediary that assumes primary Form 1099 reporting and 
backup withholding responsibility but not primary withholding under 
chapter 3. (1) If a payment is made to a qualified intermediary that 
assumes primary Form 1099 reporting and backup withholding 
responsibility for the payment (but does not assume primary withholding 
responsibility under chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code), a 
withholding agent can reliably associate the payment with valid 
documentation only to the extent that, prior to the payment, the 
withholding agent has received a valid qualified intermediary 
withholding certificate and the withholding agent can reliably determine 
the portion of the payment that relates to a withholding rate pool or 
pools provided as part of the qualified intermediary's withholding 
statement and the portion of the payment for which the qualified 
intermediary assumes primary Form 1099 reporting and backup withholding 
responsibility.
    (2) The following example illustrates the rules of paragraph 
(b)(2)((vii)(D)(1) of this section:

    Example. WH makes a payment of U.S. source dividends to QI, a 
qualified intermediary. QI has provided WH with a valid qualified 
intermediary withholding certificate. QI states on its withholding 
statement accompanying the certificate that it assumes primary Form 1099 
reporting and backup withholding responsibility but does not assume 
primary withholding responsibility under chapter 3 of the Internal 
Revenue Code. QI represents that 15 percent of the dividend is subject 
to a 30 percent rate of withholding, 75 percent of the dividend is 
subject to a 15 percent rate of withholding, and that QI assumed primary 
Form 1099 reporting and backup withholding for the remaining 10 percent 
of the payment. The entire payment can be reliably associated with valid 
documentation.

    (F) Special rules applicable to a withholding certificate provided 
by a qualified intermediary that assumes primary withholding 
responsibility under chapter 3 and primary Form 1099 reporting and 
backup withholding responsibility and a withholding certificate provided 
by a withholding foreign partnership. If a payment is made to a 
qualified intermediary that assumes both primary withholding 
responsibility under chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code and primary 
Form 1099 reporting and backup withholding responsibility under chapter 
61 and section 3406 of the Internal Revenue Code for the payment, a 
withholding agent can reliably associate a payment with valid 
documentation provided that it receives a valid qualified intermediary 
withholding certificate as described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this 
section. In the case of a payment made to a withholding foreign 
partnership, the withholding agent can reliably associate the payment 
with valid documentation to the extent it can associate the payment with 
a valid withholding certificate described in Sec. 1.1441-5(c)(2)(iv).
    (3) Presumptions regarding payee's status in the absence of 
documentation--(i) General rules. A withholding agent that cannot, prior 
to the payment, reliably associate (within the meaning of paragraph 
(b)(2)(vii) of this section) a payment of an amount subject to 
withholding (as described in Sec. 1.1441-2(a)) with valid documentation 
may rely on the presumptions of this paragraph (b)(3) to determine the 
status of the payee as a U.S. or a foreign person and the payee's other 
relevant characteristics (e.g., as an owner or intermediary, as an 
individual, trust, partnership, or corporation). The determination of 
withholding and reporting requirements applicable to payments to a 
person presumed to be a foreign person is governed only by the 
provisions of chapter 3 of the Code and the regulations thereunder. For 
the determination of withholding and reporting requirements applicable 
to payments to a person presumed to be a U.S. person, see chapter 61 of 
the Code, section 3402, 3405, or 3406, and the regulations under these 
provisions. A presumption that a

[[Page 71]]

payee is a foreign payee is not a presumption that the payee is a 
foreign beneficial owner. Therefore, the provisions of this paragraph 
(b)(3) have no effect for purposes of reducing the withholding rate if 
associating the payment with documentation of foreign beneficial 
ownership is required as a condition for such rate reduction. See 
paragraph (b)(3)(ix) of this section for consequences to a withholding 
agent that fails to withhold in accordance with the presumptions set 
forth in this paragraph (b)(3) or if the withholding agent has actual 
knowledge or reason to know of facts that are contrary to the 
presumptions set forth in this paragraph (b)(3). See paragraph 
(b)(2)(vii) of this section for rules regarding the extent which a 
withholding agent can reliably associate a payment with documentation.
    (ii) Presumptions of classification as individual, corporation, 
partnership, etc. (A) In general. A withholding agent that cannot 
reliably associate a payment with a valid withholding certificate or 
that has received valid documentary evidence under Sec. Sec. 1.1441-
1(e)(1)(ii)(2) and 1.6049-5(c)(1) or (4) but cannot determine a payee's 
classification from the documentary evidence must apply the rules of 
this paragraph (b)(3)(ii) to determine the payee's classification as an 
individual, trust, estate, corporation, or partnership. The fact that a 
payee is presumed to have a certain status under the provisions of this 
paragraph (b)(3)(ii) does not mean that it is excused from furnishing 
documentation if documentation is otherwise required to obtain a reduced 
rate of withholding under this section. For example, if, for purposes of 
this paragraph (b)(3)(ii), a payee is presumed to be a tax-exempt 
organization based on Sec. 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii)(B), the withholding agent 
cannot rely on this presumption to reduce the rate of withholding on 
payments to such person (if such person is also presumed to be a foreign 
person under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section) because a 
reduction in the rate of withholding for payments to a foreign tax-
exempt organization generally requires that a valid Form W-8 described 
in Sec. 1.1441-9(b)(2) be furnished to the withholding agent.
    (B) No documentation provided. If the withholding agent cannot 
reliably associate a payment with a valid withholding certificate or 
valid documentary evidence, it must presume that the payee is an 
individual, a trust, or an estate, if the payee appears to be such 
person (e.g., based on the payee's name or other indications). In the 
absence of reliable indications that the payee is an individual, trust, 
or an estate, the withholding agent must presume that the payee is a 
corporation or one of the persons enumerated under Sec. 1.6049-
4(c)(1)(ii)(B) through (Q) if it can be so treated under Sec. 1.6049-
4(c)(1)(ii)(A)(1) or any one of the paragraphs under Sec. 1.6049-
4(c)(1)(ii)(B) through (Q) without the need to furnish documentation. If 
the withholding agent cannot treat a payee as a person described in 
Sec. 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii)(A)(1) through (Q), then the payee shall be 
presumed to be a partnership. If such a partnership is presumed to be 
foreign, it is not the beneficial owner of the income paid to it. See 
paragraph (c)(6) of this section. If such a partnership is presumed to 
be domestic, it is a U.S. non-exempt recipient for purposes of chapter 
61 of the Internal Revenue Code.
    (C) Documentary evidence furnished for offshore account. If the 
withholding agent receives valid documentary evidence, as described in 
Sec. 1.6049-5(c)(1) or (4), with respect to an offshore account from an 
entity but the documentary evidence does not establish the entity's 
classification as a corporation, trust, estate, or partnership, the 
withholding agent may presume (in the absence of actual knowledge 
otherwise) that the entity is the type of person enumerated under Sec. 
1.6049-4 (c)(1)(ii)(B) through (Q) if it can be so treated under any one 
of those paragraphs without the need to furnish documentation. If the 
withholding agent cannot treat a payee as a person described in Sec. 
1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii)(B) through (Q), then the payee shall be presumed to 
be a corporation unless the withholding agent knows, or has reason to 
know, that the entity is not classified as a corporation for U.S. tax 
purposes. If a payee is, or is presumed to be, a corporation under this 
paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(C) and a foreign person

[[Page 72]]

under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, a withholding agent shall 
not treat the payee as the beneficial owner of income if the withholding 
agent knows, or has reason to know, that the payee is not the beneficial 
owner of the income. For this purpose, a withholding agent shall have 
reason to know that the payee is not a beneficial owner if the 
documentary evidence indicates that the payee is a bank, broker, 
intermediary, custodian, or other agent, or is treated under Sec. 
1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii)(B) through (Q) as such a person. A withholding agent 
may, however, treat such a person as a beneficial owner if the foreign 
person provides a statement, in writing and signed by a person with 
authority to sign the statement, that is attached to the documentary 
evidence stating it is the beneficial owner of the income.
    (iii) Presumption of U.S. or foreign status. A payment that the 
withholding agent cannot reliably associate with documentation is 
presumed to be made to a U.S. person, except as otherwise provided in 
this paragraph (b)(3)(iii), in paragraphs (b)(3) (iv) and (v) of this 
section, or in Sec. 1.1441-5 (d) or (e).
    (A) Payments to exempt recipients. If a withholding agent cannot 
reliably associate a payment with documentation from the payee and the 
payee is an exempt recipient (as determined under the provisions of 
Sec. 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii) in the case of interest, or under similar 
provisions under chapter 61 of the Code applicable to the type of 
payment involved, but not including a payee that the withholding agent 
may treat as a foreign intermediary in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(3)(v) of this section), the payee is presumed to be a foreign person 
and not a U.S. person--
    (1) If the withholding agent has actual knowledge of the payee's 
employer identification number and that number begins with the two 
digits ``98'';
    (2) If the withholding agent's communications with the payee are 
mailed to an address in a foreign country;
    (3) If the name of the payee indicates that the entity is the type 
of entity that is on the per se list of foreign corporations contained 
in Sec. 301.7701-2(b)(8)(i) of this chapter; or
    (4) If the payment is made outside the United States (as defined in 
Sec. 1.6049-5(e)).
    (B) Scholarships and grants. A payment representing taxable 
scholarship or fellowship grant income that does not represent 
compensation for services (but is not excluded from tax under section 
117) and that a withholding agent cannot reliably associate with 
documentation is presumed to be made to a foreign person if the 
withholding agent has a record that the payee has a U.S. visa that is 
not an immigrant visa. See section 871(c) and Sec. 1.1441-4(c) for 
applicable tax rate and withholding rules.
    (C) Pensions, annuities, etc. A payment from a trust described in 
section 401(a), an annuity plan described in section 403(a), a payment 
with respect to any annuity, custodial account, or retirement income 
account described in section 403(b), or a payment from an individual 
retirement account or individual retirement annuity described in section 
408 that a withholding agent cannot reliably associate with 
documentation is presumed to be made to a U.S. person only if the 
withholding agent has a record of a Social Security number for the payee 
and relies on a mailing address described in the following sentence. A 
mailing address is an address used for purposes of information reporting 
or otherwise communicating with the payee that is an address in the 
United States or in a foreign country with which the United States has 
an income tax treaty in effect and the treaty provides that the payee, 
if an individual resident in that country, would be entitled to an 
exemption from U.S. tax on amounts described in this paragraph 
(b)(3)(iii)(C). Any payment described in this paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C) 
that is not presumed to be made to a U.S. person is presumed to be made 
to a foreign person. A withholding agent making a payment to a person 
presumed to be a foreign person may not reduce the 30-percent amount of 
withholding required on such payment unless it receives a withholding 
certificate described in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section furnished 
by the beneficial owner. For reduction in the 30-percent rate, see 
Sec. Sec. 1.1441-4(e) or 1.1441-6(b).

[[Page 73]]

    (D) Certain payments to offshore accounts. A payment is presumed 
made to a foreign payee if the payment is made outside the United States 
(as defined in Sec. 1.6049-5(e)) to an offshore account (as defined in 
Sec. 1.6049-5(c)(1)) and the withholding agent does not have actual 
knowledge that the payee is a U.S. person. See Sec. 1.6049-5(d)(2) and 
(3) for exceptions to this rule.
    (iv) Grace period. A withholding agent may choose to apply the 
provisions of Sec. 1.6049-5(d)(2)(ii) regarding a 90-day grace period 
for purposes of this paragraph (b)(3) (by applying the term withholding 
agent instead of the term payor) to amounts described in Sec. 1.1441-
6(c)(2) and to amounts covered by a Form 8233 described in Sec. 1.1441-
4(b)(2)(ii). Thus, for these amounts, a withholding agent may choose to 
treat an account holder as a foreign person and withhold under chapter 3 
of the Internal Revenue Code (and the regulations thereunder) while 
awaiting documentation. For purposes of determining the rate of 
withholding under this section, the withholding agent must withhold at 
the unreduced 30-percent rate at the time that the amounts are credited 
to an account. However, a withholding agent who can reliably associate 
the payment with a withholding certificate that is otherwise valid 
within the meaning of the applicable provisions except for the fact that 
it is transmitted by facsimile may rely on that facsimile form for 
purposes of withholding at the claimed reduced rate. For reporting of 
amounts credited both before and after the grace period, see Sec. 
1.1461-1(c)(4)(i)(A). The following adjustments shall be made at the 
expiration of the grace period:
    (A) If, at the end of the grace period, the documentation is not 
furnished in the manner required under this section and the account 
holder is presumed to be a U.S. non-exempt recipient, then backup 
withholding applies to amounts credited to the account after the 
expiration of the grace period only. Amounts credited to the account 
during the grace period shall be treated as owned by a foreign payee and 
adjustments must be made to correct any underwithholding on such amounts 
in the manner described in Sec. 1.1461-2.
    (B) If, at the end of the grace period, the documentation is not 
furnished in the manner required under this section, or if documentation 
is furnished that does not support the claimed rate reduction, and the 
account holder is presumed to be a foreign person then adjustments must 
be made to correct any underwithholding on amounts credited to the 
account during the grace period, based on the adjustment procedures 
described in Sec. 1.1461-2.
    (v) Special rules applicable to payments to foreign intermediaries--
(A) Reliance on claim of status as foreign intermediary. The presumption 
rules of paragraph (b)(3)(v)(B) of this section apply to a payment made 
to an intermediary (whether the intermediary is a qualified or 
nonqualified intermediary) that has provided a valid withholding 
certificate under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) or (iii) of this section (or has 
provided documentary evidence described in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(C) of 
this section that indicates it is a bank, broker, custodian, 
intermediary, or other agent) to the extent the withholding agent cannot 
treat the payment as being reliably associated with valid documentation 
under the rules of paragraph (b)(2)(vii) of this section. For this 
purpose, a U.S. person's foreign branch that is a qualified intermediary 
defined in paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of this section shall be treated as a 
foreign intermediary. A payee that the withholding agent may not 
reliably treat as a foreign intermediary under this paragraph 
(b)(3)(v)(A) is presumed to be a payee other than an intermediary whose 
classification as an individual, corporation, partnership, etc., must be 
determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section to 
the extent relevant. In addition, such payee is presumed to be a U.S. or 
a foreign payee based upon the presumptions described in paragraph 
(b)(3)(iii) of this section. The provisions of paragraph (b)(3)(v)(B) of 
this section are not relevant to a withholding agent that can reliably 
associate a payment with a withholding certificate from a person 
representing to be a qualified intermediary to the extent the qualified 
intermediary has assumed primary withholding responsibility in 
accordance with paragraph (e)(5)(iv) of this section.

[[Page 74]]

    (B) Beneficial owner documentation or allocation information is 
lacking or unreliable. Any portion of a payment that the withholding 
agent may treat as made to a foreign intermediary (whether a 
nonqualified or a qualified intermediary) but that the withholding agent 
cannot treat as reliably associated with valid documentation under the 
rules of paragraph (b)(2)(vii) of this section is presumed made to an 
unknown, undocumented foreign payee. As a result, a withholding agent 
must deduct and withhold 30 percent from any payment of an amount 
subject to withholding. If a withholding certificate attached to an 
intermediary certificate is another intermediary withholding certificate 
or a flow-through withholding certificate, the rules of this paragraph 
(b)(3)(v)(B) (or Sec. 1.1441-5(d)(3) or (e)(6)(iii)) apply by treating 
the share of the payment allocable to the other intermediary or flow-
through entity as if it were made directly to the other intermediary or 
flow-through entity. Any payment of an amount subject to withholding 
that is presumed made to an undocumented foreign person must be reported 
on Form 1042-S. See Sec. 1.1461-1(c). See Sec. 1.6049-5(d) for 
payments that are not subject to withholding.
    (vi) U.S. branches. The rules of paragraph (b)(3)(v)(B) of this 
section shall apply to payments to a U.S. branch described in paragraph 
(b)(2)(iv)(A) of this section that has provided a withholding 
certificate as described in paragraph (e)(3)(v) of this section on which 
it has not agreed to be treated as a U.S. person.
    (vii) Joint payees--(A) In general. Except as provided in paragraph 
(b)(3)(vii)(B) of this section, if a withholding agent makes a payment 
to joint payees and cannot reliably associate a payment with valid 
documentation from all payees, the payment is presumed made to an 
unidentified U.S. person. However, if one of the joint payees provides a 
Form W-9 furnished in accordance with the procedures described in 
Sec. Sec. 31.3406(d)-1 through 31.3406(d)-5 of this chapter, the 
payment shall be treated as made to that payee. See Sec. 31.3406(h)-2 
of this chapter for rules to determine the relevant payee if more than 
one Form W-9 is provided. For purposes of applying this paragraph 
(b)(3), the grace period rules in paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section 
shall apply only if each payee meets the conditions described in 
paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section.
    (B) Special rule for offshore accounts. If a withholding agent makes 
a payment to joint payees and cannot reliably associate a payment with 
valid documentation from all payees, the payment is presumed made to an 
unknown foreign payee if the payment is made outside the United States 
(as defined in Sec. 1.6049-5(e)) to an offshore account (as defined in 
Sec. 1.6049-5(c)(1)).
    (viii) Rebuttal of presumptions. A payee or beneficial owner may 
rebut the presumptions described in this paragraph (b)(3) by providing 
reliable documentation to the withholding agent or, if applicable, to 
the IRS.
    (ix) Effect of reliance on presumptions and of actual knowledge or 
reason to know otherwise--(A) General rule. Except as otherwise provided 
in paragraph (b)(3)(ix)(B) of this section, a withholding agent that 
withholds on a payment under section 3402, 3405 or 3406 in accordance 
with the presumptions set forth in this paragraph (b)(3) shall not be 
liable for withholding under this section even it is later established 
that the beneficial owner of the payment is, in fact, a foreign person. 
Similarly, a withholding agent that withholds on a payment under this 
section in accordance with the presumptions set forth in this paragraph 
(b)(3) shall not be liable for withholding under section 3402 or 3405 or 
for backup withholding under section 3406 even if it is later 
established that the payee or beneficial owner is, in fact, a U.S. 
person. A withholding agent that, instead of relying on the presumptions 
described in this paragraph (b)(3), relies on its own actual knowledge 
to withhold a lesser amount, not withhold, or not report a payment, even 
though reporting of the payment or withholding a greater amount would be 
required if the withholding agent relied on the presumptions described 
in this paragraph (b)(3) shall be liable for tax, interest, and 
penalties to the extent provided under section 1461 and the regulations 
under that section. See paragraph (b)(7) of this section for provisions 
regarding

[[Page 75]]

such liability if the withholding agent fails to withhold in accordance 
with the presumptions described in this paragraph (b)(3).
    (B) Actual knowledge or reason to know that amount of withholding is 
greater than is required under the presumptions or that reporting of the 
payment is required. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 
(b)(3)(ix)(A) of this section, a withholding agent may not rely on the 
presumptions described in this paragraph (b)(3) to the extent it has 
actual knowledge or reason to know that the status or characteristics of 
the payee or of the beneficial owner are other than what is presumed 
under this paragraph (b)(3) and, if based on such knowledge or reason to 
know, it should withhold (under this section or another withholding 
provision of the Code) an amount greater than would be the case if it 
relied on the presumptions described in this paragraph (b)(3) or it 
should report (under this section or under another provision of the 
Code) an amount that would not otherwise be reportable if it relied on 
the presumptions described in this paragraph (b)(3). In such a case, the 
withholding agent must rely on its actual knowledge or reason to know 
rather than on the presumptions set forth in this paragraph (b)(3). 
Failure to do so and, as a result, failure to withhold the higher amount 
or to report the payment, shall result in liability for tax, interest, 
and penalties to the extent provided under sections 1461 and 1463 and 
the regulations under those sections.
    (x) Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (b)(3) are 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. A withholding agent, W, makes a payment of U.S. source 
dividends to person X, Inc. at an address outside the United States. W 
cannot reliably associate the payment to X with documentation. Under 
Sec. Sec. 1.6042-3(b)(1)(vii) and 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii)(A)(1), W may treat 
X as a corporation. Thus, under the presumptions described in paragraph 
(b)(3)(iii) of this section, W must presume that X is a foreign person 
(because the payment is made outside the United States). However, W 
knows that X is a U.S. person who is an exempt recipient. W may not rely 
on its actual knowledge to not withhold under this section. If W's 
knowledge is, in fact, incorrect, W would be liable for tax, interest, 
and, if applicable, penalties, under section 1461. W would be permitted 
to reduce or eliminate its liability for the tax by establishing, in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(7) of this section, that the tax is not 
due or has been satisfied. If W's actual knowledge is, in fact, correct, 
W may nevertheless be liable for tax, interest, or penalties under 
section 1461 for the amount that W should have withheld based upon the 
presumptions. W would be permitted to reduce or eliminate its liability 
for the tax by establishing, in accordance with paragraph (b)(7) of this 
section, that its actual knowledge was, in fact, correct and that no tax 
or a lesser amount of tax was due.
    Example 2. A withholding agent, W, makes a payment of U.S. source 
dividends to Y who does not qualify as an exempt recipient under 
Sec. Sec. 1.6042-3(b)(1)(vii) and 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii). W cannot reliably 
associate the payment to Y with documentation. Under the presumptions 
described in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, W must presume that 
Y is a U.S. person who is not an exempt recipient for purposes of 
section 6042. However, W knows that Y is a foreign person. W may not 
rely on its actual knowledge to withhold under this section rather than 
backup withhold under section 3406. If W's knowledge is, in fact, 
incorrect, W would be liable for tax, interest, and, if applicable, 
penalties, under section 3403. If W's actual knowledge is, in fact, 
correct, W may nevertheless be liable for tax, interest, or penalties 
under section 3403 for the amount that W should have withheld based upon 
the presumptions. Paragraph (b)(7) of this section does not apply to 
provide relief from liability under section 3403.
    Example 3. A withholding agent, W, makes a payment of U.S. source 
dividends to X, Inc. W cannot reliably associate the payment to X, Inc. 
with documentation. X, Inc. presents none of the indicia of foreign 
status described in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, but W has 
actual knowledge that X, Inc. is a foreign corporation. W may treat X, 
Inc. as an exempt recipient under Sec. 1.6042-3(b)(1)(vii). Because 
there are no indicia of foreign status, W would, absent actual knowledge 
or reason to know otherwise, be permitted to treat X, Inc. as a domestic 
corporation in accordance with the presumptions of paragraph (b)(3)(iii) 
of this section. However, under paragraph (b)(3)(ix)(B) of this section, 
W may not rely on the presumption of U.S. status since reliance on its 
actual knowledge requires that it withhold an amount greater than would 
be the case under the presumptions.
    Example 4. A withholding agent, W, is a plan administrator who makes 
pension payments to person X with a mailing address in a foreign country 
with which the United States has an income tax treaty in effect. Under 
that treaty, the type of pension income paid to X is taxable solely in 
the country of residence. The plan administrator has

[[Page 76]]

a record of X's U.S. social security number. W has no actual knowledge 
or reason to know that X is a foreign person. W may rely on the 
presumption of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C) of this section in order to 
treat X as a U.S. person. Therefore, any withholding and reporting 
requirements for the payment are governed by the provisions of section 
3405 and the regulations under that section.

    (4) List of exemptions from, or reduced rates of, withholding under 
chapter 3 of the Code. A withholding agent that has determined that the 
payee is a foreign person for purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section must determine whether the payee is entitled to a reduced rate 
of withholding under section 1441, 1442, or 1443. This paragraph (b)(4) 
identifies items for which a reduction in the rate of withholding may 
apply and whether the rate reduction is conditioned upon documentation 
being furnished to the withholding agent. Documentation required under 
this paragraph (b)(4) is documentation that a withholding agent must be 
able to associate with a payment upon which it can rely to treat the 
payment as made to a foreign person that is the beneficial owner of the 
payment in accordance with paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section. This 
paragraph (b)(4) also cross-references other sections of the Code and 
applicable regulations in which some of these exceptions, exemptions, or 
reductions are further explained. See, for example, paragraph 
(b)(4)(viii) of this section, dealing with effectively connected income, 
that cross-references Sec. 1.1441-4(a); see paragraph (b)(4)(xv) of 
this section, dealing with exemptions from, or reductions of, 
withholding under an income tax treaty, that cross-references Sec. 
1.1441-6. This paragraph (b)(4) is not an exclusive list of items to 
which a reduction of the rate of withholding may apply and, thus, does 
not preclude an exemption from, or reduction in, the rate of withholding 
that may otherwise be allowed under the regulations under the provisions 
of chapter 3 of the Code for a particular item of income identified in 
this paragraph (b)(4).
    (i) Portfolio interest described in section 871(h) or 881(c) and 
substitute interest payments described in Sec. 1.871-7(b)(2) or 1.881-
2(b)(2) are exempt from withholding under section 1441(a). See Sec. 
1.871-14 for regulations regarding portfolio interest and section 
1441(c)(9) for exemption from withholding. Documentation establishing 
foreign status is required for interest on an obligation in registered 
form to qualify as portfolio interest. See section 871(h)(2)(B)(ii) and 
Sec. 1.871-14(c)(1)(ii)(C). For special documentation rules regarding 
foreign-targeted registered obligations described in Sec. 1.871-
14(e)(2), see Sec. 1.871-14(e) (3) and (4) and, in particular, Sec. 
1.871-14(e)(4)(i)(A) and (ii)(A) regarding the time when the withholding 
agent must receive the documentation. The documentation furnished for 
purposes of qualifying interest as portfolio interest serves as the 
basis for the withholding exemption for purposes of this section and for 
purposes of establishing foreign status for purposes of section 6049. 
See Sec. 1.6049-5(b)(8). Documentation establishing foreign status is 
not required for qualifying interest on an obligation in bearer form 
described in Sec. 1.871-14(b)(1) as portfolio interest. However, in 
certain cases, documentation for portfolio interest on a bearer 
obligation may have to be furnished in order to establish foreign status 
for purposes of the information reporting provisions of section 6049 and 
backup withholding under section 3406. See Sec. 1.6049-5(b)(7).
    (ii) Bank deposit interest and similar types of deposit interest 
(including original issue discount) described in section 871(i)(2)(A) or 
881(d) that are from sources within the United States are exempt from 
withholding under section 1441(a). See section 1441(c)(10). 
Documentation establishing foreign status is not required for purposes 
of this withholding exemption but may have to be furnished for purposes 
of the information reporting provisions of section 6049 and backup 
withholding under section 3406. See Sec. 1.6049-5(d)(3)(iii) for 
exceptions to the foreign payee and exempt recipient rules regarding 
this type of income. See also Sec. 1.6049-5(b)(11) for applicable 
documentation exemptions for certain bank deposit interest paid on 
obligations in bearer form.
    (iii) Bank deposit interest (including original issue discount) 
described in section 861(a)(1)(B) is exempt from withholding under 
sections 1441(a) as income that is not from U.S. sources. Documentation 
establishing foreign

[[Page 77]]

status is not required for purposes of this withholding exemption but 
may have to be furnished for purposes of the information reporting 
provisions of section 6049 and backup withholding under section 3406. 
Reporting requirements for payments of such interest are governed by 
section 6049 and the regulations under that section. See Sec. 1.6049-
5(b)(12) and alternative documentation rules under Sec. 1.6049-5(c)(1).
    (iv) Interest or original issue discount from sources within the 
United States on certain short-term obligations described in section 
871(g)(1)(B) or 881(a)(3) is exempt from withholding under sections 
1441(a). Documentation establishing foreign status is not required for 
purposes of this withholding exemption but may have to be furnished for 
purposes of the information reporting provisions of section 6049 and 
backup withholding under section 3406. See Sec. 1.6049-5(b)(12) for 
applicable documentation for establishing foreign status and Sec. 
1.6049-5(d)(3)(iii) for exceptions to the foreign payee and exempt 
recipient rules regarding this type of income. See also Sec. 1.6049-
5(b)(10) for applicable documentation exemptions for certain obligations 
in bearer form.
    (v) Income from sources without the United States is exempt from 
withholding under sections 1441(a). Documentation establishing foreign 
status is not required for purposes of this withholding exemption but 
may have to be furnished for purposes of the information reporting 
provisions of section 6049 or other applicable provisions of chapter 61 
of the Code and backup withholding under section 3406. See, for example, 
Sec. 1.6049-5(b) (6) and (12) and alternative documentation rules under 
Sec. 1.6049-5(c). See also paragraph (b)(5) of this section for cross 
references to other applicable provisions of the regulations under 
chapter 61 of the Code.
    (vi) Distributions from certain domestic corporations described in 
section 871(i)(2)(B) or 881(d) are exempt from withholding under section 
1441(a). See section 1441(c)(10). Documentation establishing foreign 
status is not required for purposes of this withholding exemption but 
may have to be furnished for purposes of the information reporting 
provisions of section 6042 and backup withholding under section 3406. 
See Sec. 1.6042-3(b)(1) (iii) through (vi).
    (vii) Dividends paid by certain foreign corporations that are 
treated as income from sources within the United States by reason of 
section 861(a)(2)(B) are exempt from withholding under section 884(e)(3) 
to the extent that the distributions are paid out of earnings and 
profits in any taxable year that the corporation was subject to branch 
profits tax for that year. Documentation establishing foreign status is 
not required for purposes of this withholding exemption but may have to 
be furnished for purposes of the information reporting provisions of 
section 6042 and backup withholding under section 3406. See Sec. 
1.6042-3(b)(1) (iii) through (vii).
    (viii) Certain income that is effectively connected with the conduct 
of a U.S. trade or business is exempt from withholding under section 
1441(a). See section 1441(c)(1). Documentation establishing foreign 
status and status of the income as effectively connected must be 
furnished for purposes of this withholding exemption to the extent 
required under the provisions of Sec. 1.1441-4(a). Documentation 
furnished for this purpose also serves as documentation establishing 
foreign status for purposes of applicable information reporting 
provisions under chapter 61 of the Code and for backup withholding under 
section 3406. See, for example, Sec. 1.6041-4(a)(1).
    (ix) Certain income with respect to compensation for personal 
services of an individual that are performed in the United States is 
exempt from withholding under section 1441(a). See section 1441(c)(4) 
and Sec. 1.1441-4(b). However, such income may be subject to 
withholding as wages under section 3402. Documentation establishing 
foreign status must be furnished for purposes of any withholding 
exemption or reduction to the extent required under Sec. 1.1441-4(b) or 
31.3401(a)(6)-1 (e) and (f) of this chapter. Documentation furnished for 
this purpose also serves as documentation establishing foreign status 
for purposes of information reporting under section 6041. See Sec. 
1.6041-4(a)(1).
    (x) Amounts described in section 871(f) that are received as 
annuities

[[Page 78]]

from certain qualified plans are exempt from withholding under section 
1441(a). See section 1441(c)(7). Documentation establishing foreign 
status must be furnished for purposes of the withholding exemption as 
required under Sec. 1.1441-4(d). Documentation furnished for this 
purpose also serves as documentation establishing foreign status for 
purposes of information reporting under section 6041. See Sec. 1.6041-
4(a)(1).
    (xi) Payments to a foreign government (including a foreign central 
bank of issue) that are excludable from gross income under section 
892(a) are exempt from withholding under section 1442. See Sec. 1.1441-
8(b). Documentation establishing status as a foreign government is 
required for purposes of this withholding exemption. Payments to a 
foreign government are exempt from information reporting under chapter 
61 of the Code (see Sec. 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii)(F)).
    (xii) Payments of certain interest income to a foreign central bank 
of issue or the Bank for International Settlements that are exempt from 
tax under section 895 are exempt from withholding under section 1442. 
Documentation establishing eligibility for such exemption is required to 
the extent provided in Sec. 1.1441-8(c)(1). Payments to a foreign 
central bank of issue or to the Bank for International Settlements are 
exempt from information reporting under chapter 61 of the Code (see 
Sec. 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii) (H) and (M)).
    (xiii) Amounts derived by a foreign central bank of issue from 
bankers' acceptances described in section 871(i)(2)(C) or 881(d) are 
exempt from tax and, therefore, from withholding. See section 
1441(c)(10). Documentation establishing foreign status is not required 
for purposes of this withholding exemption if the name of the payee and 
other facts surrounding the payment reasonably indicate that the 
beneficial owner of the payment is a foreign central bank of issue as 
defined in Sec. 1.861-2(b)(4). See Sec. 1.1441-8(c)(2) for withholding 
procedures. See also Sec. Sec. 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii)(H) and 1.6041-3(q)(8) 
for a similar exemption from information reporting.
    (xiv) Payments to an international organization from investments in 
the United States of stocks, bonds, or other domestic securities or from 
interest on deposits in banks in the United States of funds belonging to 
such international organization are exempt from tax under section 892(b) 
and, thus, from withholding. Documentation establishing status as an 
international organization is not required if the name of the payee and 
other facts surrounding the payment reasonably indicate that the 
beneficial owner of the payment is an international organization within 
the meaning of section 7701(a)(18). See Sec. 1.1441-8(d). Payments to 
an international organization are exempt from information reporting 
under chapter 61 of the Code (see Sec. 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii)(G)).
    (xv) Amounts may be exempt from, or subject to a reduced rate of, 
withholding under an income tax treaty. Documentation establishing 
eligibility for benefits under an income tax treaty is required for this 
purpose as provided under Sec. Sec. 1.1441-6. Documentation furnished 
for this purpose also serves as documentation establishing foreign 
status for purposes of applicable information reporting provisions under 
chapter 61 of the Code and for backup withholding under section 3406. 
See, for example, Sec. 1.6041-4(a)(1).
    (xvi) Amounts of scholarships and grants paid to certain exchange or 
training program participants that do not represent compensation for 
services but are not excluded from tax under section 117 are subject to 
a reduced rate of withholding of 14-percent under section 1441(b). 
Documentation establishing foreign status is required for purposes of 
this reduction in rate as provided under Sec. 1.1441-4(c). This income 
is not subject to information reporting under chapter 61 of the Code nor 
to backup withholding under section 3406. The compensatory portion of a 
scholarship or grant is reportable as wage income. See Sec. 1.6041-
3(o).
    (xvii) Amounts paid to a foreign organization described in section 
501(c) are exempt from withholding under section 1441 to the extent that 
the amounts are not income includible under section 512 in computing the 
organization's unrelated business taxable income and are not subject to 
the tax

[[Page 79]]

imposed by section 4948(a). Documentation establishing status as a tax-
exempt organization is required for purposes of this exemption to the 
extent provided in Sec. 1.1441-9. Amounts includible under section 512 
in computing the organization's unrelated business taxable income are 
subject to withholding to the extent provided in section 1443(a) and 
Sec. 1.1443-1(a). Gross investment income (as defined in section 
4940(c)(2)) of a private foundation is subject to withholding at a 4-
percent rate to the extent provided in section 1443(b) and Sec. 1.1443-
1(b). Payments to a tax-exempt organization are exempt from information 
reporting under chapter 61 of the Code and the regulations thereunder 
(see Sec. 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii)(B)(1)).
    (xviii) Per diem amounts for subsistence paid by the U.S. government 
to a nonresident alien individual who is engaged in any program of 
training in the United States under the Mutual Security Act of 1954 are 
exempt from withholding under section 1441(a). See section 1441(c)(6). 
Documentation of foreign status is not required under Sec. 1.1441-4(e) 
for purposes of establishing eligibility for this exemption. See Sec. 
1.6041-3(p).
    (xix) Interest with respect to tax-free covenant bonds issued prior 
to 1934 is subject to special withholding procedures set forth in Sec. 
1.1461-1 in effect prior to January 1, 2001 (see Sec. 1.1461-1 as 
contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 1999).
    (xx) Income from certain gambling winnings of a nonresident alien 
individual is exempt from tax under section 871(j) and from withholding 
under section 1441(a). See section 1441(c)(11). Documentation 
establishing foreign status is not required for purposes of this 
exemption but may have to be furnished for purposes of the information 
reporting provisions of section 6041 and backup withholding under 
section 3406. See Sec. Sec. 1.6041-1 and 1.6041-4(a)(1).
    (xxi) Any payments not otherwise mentioned in this paragraph (b)(4) 
shall be subject to withholding at the rate of 30-percent if it is an 
amount subject to withholding (as defined in Sec. 1.1441-2(a)) unless 
and to the extent the IRS may otherwise prescribe in published guidance 
(see Sec. 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter) or unless otherwise provided 
in regulations under chapter 3 of the Code.
    (5) Establishing foreign status under applicable provisions of 
chapter 61 of the Code. This paragraph (b)(5) identifies relevant 
provisions of the regulations under chapter 61 of the Code that exempt 
payments from information reporting, and therefore, from backup 
withholding under section 3406, based on the payee's status as a foreign 
person. Many of these exemptions require that the payee's foreign status 
be established in order for the exemption to apply. The regulations 
under applicable provisions of chapter 61 of the Code generally provide 
that the documentation described in this section may be relied upon for 
purposes of determining foreign status.
    (i) Payments to a foreign person that are governed by section 6041 
(dealing with certain trade or business income) are exempt from 
information reporting under Sec. 1.6041-4(a).
    (ii) Payments to a foreign person that are governed by section 6041A 
(dealing with remuneration for services and certain sales) are exempt 
from information reporting under Sec. 1.6041A-1(d)(3).
    (iii) Payments to a foreign person that are governed by section 6042 
(dealing with dividends) are exempt from information reporting under 
Sec. 1.6042-3(b)(1) (iii) through (vi).
    (iv) Payments to a foreign person that are governed by section 6044 
(dealing with patronage dividends) are exempt from information reporting 
under Sec. 1.6044-3(c)(1).
    (v) Payments to a foreign person that are governed by section 6045 
(dealing with broker proceeds) are exempt from information reporting 
under Sec. 1.6045-1(g).
    (vi) Payments to a foreign person that are governed by section 6049 
(dealing with interest) to a foreign person are exempt from information 
reporting under Sec. 1.6049-5(b) (6) through (15).
    (vii) Payments to a foreign person that are governed by section 
6050N (dealing with royalties) are exempt from information reporting 
under Sec. 1.6050N-1(c).
    (viii) Payments to a foreign person that are governed by section 
6050P (dealing with income from cancellation

[[Page 80]]

of debt) are exempt from information reporting under section 6050P or 
the regulations under that section except to the extent provided in 
Notice 96-61 (1996-2 C.B. 227); see also Sec. 601.601(b)(2) of this 
chapter.
    (6) Rules of withholding for payments by a foreign intermediary or 
certain U.S. branches--(i) In general. A foreign intermediary described 
in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section or a U.S. branch described in 
paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section that receives an amount subject to 
withholding (as defined in Sec. 1.1441-2(a)) shall be required to 
withhold (if another withholding agent has not withheld the full amount 
required) and report such payment under chapter 3 of the Internal 
Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder except as otherwise provided 
in this paragraph (b)(6). A nonqualified intermediary or U.S. branch 
described in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section (other than a branch 
that is treated as a U.S. person) shall not be required to withhold or 
report if it has provided a valid nonqualified intermediary withholding 
certificate or a U.S. branch withholding certificate, it has provided 
all of the information required by paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this section 
(withholding statement), and it does not know, and has no reason to 
know, that another withholding agent failed to withhold the correct 
amount or failed to report the payment correctly under Sec. 1.1461-
1(c). A qualified intermediary's obligations to withhold and report 
shall be determined in accordance with its qualified intermediary 
withholding agreement.
    (ii) Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of 
paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section:

    Example 1. FB, a foreign bank, acts as intermediary for five 
different persons, A, B, C, D, and E, each of whom owns U.S. securities 
that generate U.S. source dividends. The dividends are paid by USWA, a 
U.S. withholding agent. FB furnished USWA with a nonqualified 
intermediary withholding certificate, described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) 
of this section, to which it attached the withholding certificates of 
each of A, B, C, D, and E. The withholding certificates from A and B 
claim a 15 percent reduced rate of withholding under an income tax 
treaty. C, D, and E claim no reduced rate of withholding. FB provides a 
withholding statement that meets all of the requirements of paragraph 
(e)(3)(iv) of this section, including information allocating 20 percent 
of each dividend payment to each of A, B, C, D, and E. FB does not have 
actual knowledge or reason to know that USWA did not withhold the 
correct amounts or report the dividends on Forms 1042-S to each of A, B, 
C, D, and E. FB is not required to withhold or to report the dividends 
to A, B, C, D, and E.
    Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that FB 
did not provide any information for USWA to determine how much of the 
dividend payments were made to A, B, C, D, and E. Because USWA could not 
reliably associate the dividend payments with documentation under 
paragraph (b)(2)(vii) of this section, USWA applied the presumption 
rules of paragraph (b)(3)(v) of this section and withheld 30 percent 
from all dividend payments. In addition, USWA filed a single Form 1042-S 
reporting the payment to an unknown foreign payee. FB is deemed to know 
that USWA did not report the payment to A, B, C, D, and E because it did 
not provide all of the information required on a withholding statement 
under paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this section (i.e., allocation 
information). Although FB is not required to withhold on the payment 
because the full 30 percent withholding was imposed by USWA, it is 
required to report the payments on Forms 1042-S to A, B, C, D, and E. 
FB's intentional failure to do so will subject it to intentional 
disregard penalties under sections 6721 and 6722.

    (7) Liability for failure to obtain documentation timely or to act 
in accordance with applicable presumptions--(i) General rule. A 
withholding agent that cannot reliably associate a payment with 
documentation on the date of payment and that does not withhold under 
this section, or withholds at less than the 30-percent rate prescribed 
under section 1441(a) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section, is liable 
under section 1461 for the tax required to be withheld under chapter 3 
of the Code and the regulations thereunder, without the benefit of a 
reduced rate unless--
    (A) The withholding agent has appropriately relied on the 
presumptions described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section (including 
the grace period described in paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section) in 
order to treat the payee as a U.S. person or, if applicable, on the 
presumptions described in Sec. 1.1441-4(a) (2)(ii) or (3)(i) to treat 
the payment as effectively connected income; or
    (B) The withholding agent can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the 
district director or the Assistant Commissioner (International) that the 
proper

[[Page 81]]

amount of tax, if any, was in fact paid to the IRS; or
    (C) No documentation is required under section 1441 or this section 
in order for a reduced rate of withholding to apply.
    (D) The withholding agent has complied with the provisions of Sec. 
1.1441-6(c) or (g).
    (ii) Proof that tax liability has been satisfied. Proof of payment 
of tax may be established for purposes of paragraph (b)(7)(i)(B) of this 
section on the basis of a Form 4669 (or such other form as the IRS may 
prescribe in published guidance (see Sec. 601.601(d)(2) of this 
chapter)), establishing the amount of tax, if any, actually paid by or 
for the beneficial owner on the income. Proof that a reduced rate of 
withholding was, in fact, appropriate under the provisions of chapter 3 
of the Code and the regulations thereunder may also be established after 
the date of payment by the withholding agent on the basis of a valid 
withholding certificate or other appropriate documentation furnished 
after that date. However, in the case of a withholding certificate or 
other appropriate documentation received after the date of payment (or 
after the grace period specified in paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this 
section), the district director or the Assistant Commissioner 
(International) may require additional proof if it is determined that 
the delays in obtaining the withholding certificate affect its 
reliability.
    (iii) Liability for interest and penalties. A withholding agent that 
has failed to withhold other than based on appropriate reliance on the 
presumptions described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section or in Sec. 
1.1441-4(a) (2)(ii) or (3)(i) is not relieved from liability for 
interest under section 6601. Such liability exists even if there is no 
underlying tax liability due. The interest on the amount that should 
have been withheld shall be imposed as prescribed under section 6601 
beginning on the last date for paying the tax due under section 1461 
(which, under section 6601, is the due date for filing the withholding 
agent's return of tax). The interest shall stop accruing on the earlier 
of the date that the required withholding certificate or other 
documentation is provided to the withholding agent and to the extent of 
the amount of tax that is determined not to be due based on 
documentation provided, or the date, and to the extent, that the unpaid 
tax liability under section 871, 881 or under section 1461 is satisfied. 
Further, in the event that a tax liability is assessed against the 
beneficial owner under section 871, 881, or 882 and interest under 
section 6601(a) is assessed against, and collected from, the beneficial 
owner, the interest charge imposed on the withholding agent shall be 
abated to that extent so as to avoid the imposition of a double interest 
charge. However, the withholding agent is not relieved of any applicable 
penalties. See section 1464.
    (iv) Special effective date. See paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this 
section for the special effective date applicable to this paragraph 
(b)(7).
    (v) Examples. The provisions of paragraph (b)(7) of this section are 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. On June 15, 2001, a withholding agent pays U.S. source 
interest on an obligation in registered form (issued after July 18, 
1984) to a foreign corporation that it cannot reliably associate with a 
Form W-8 or other appropriate documentation upon which to rely to treat 
the beneficial owner as a foreign person. The withholding agent does not 
withhold from the payment. On September 30, 2003, the withholding agent 
receives from the foreign corporation a valid Form W-8 described in 
paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section. Thus, the interest qualifies as 
portfolio interest retroactively to June 15, 2001 (the date of payment). 
See Sec. 1.871-14(c)(3). The foreign corporation does not file a U.S. 
federal income tax return and does not pay the tax owed. The withholding 
agent is not liable under section 1461 for the 30-percent tax on the 
interest income because the receipt of the Form W-8 exempts the interest 
from tax for purposes of sections 881(a) and 1461. The withholding 
agent, however, is liable for interest on the amount of withholding that 
should have been deducted from the payment on June 15, 2001 and 
deposited. Under paragraph (b)(7)(iii) of this section, the period 
during which interest may be assessed against the withholding agent runs 
from March 15, 2002 (the due date for the Form 1042 relating to the 
payment) until September 30, 2003 (i.e., the date that appropriate 
documentation is furnished to the withholding agent).
    Example 2. On June 15, 2001, a withholding agent pays U.S. source 
dividends to a foreign corporation that it cannot reliably associate

[[Page 82]]

with a Form W-8 or other appropriate documentation upon which to rely to 
treat the beneficial owner as a foreign person. The withholding agent 
does not withhold from the payment. On September 30, 2003, the 
withholding agent receives from the foreign corporation a valid Form W-8 
described in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section claiming a reduced 15-
percent rate of withholding under a U.S. income tax treaty. The dividend 
qualifies for the reduced treaty rate retroactively to June 15, 2001 
(the date of payment). The foreign corporation does not file a U.S. 
federal income tax return and does not pay the tax owed. Under section 
1461, the withholding agent is liable only for a 15-percent tax on the 
dividend income because the receipt of the Form W-8 allows the tax rate 
to be reduced for purposes of sections 881(a) and 1461 from 30 percent 
to 15 percent. The withholding agent, however, is liable for interest on 
the full 30-percent amount that should have been deducted and withheld 
from the payment on June 15, 2001, and deposited, over a period running 
from March 15, 2002 (the due date for the Form 1042 relating to the 
payment) until September 30, 2003 (the date that the appropriate 
documentation is furnished to the withholding agent supporting a 
reduction in rate under a tax treaty). Additional interest may be 
assessed relating to the outstanding 15-percent tax liability (i.e., the 
portion of the 30-percent total tax liability that is not reduced under 
the treaty). Such additional interest runs from March 15, 2002, until 
such date as that 15-percent tax liability is satisfied by the 
withholding agent or the taxpayer (subject to abatement in order to 
avoid a double interest charge).

    (8) Adjustments, refunds, or credits of overwithheld amounts. If the 
amount withheld under section 1441, 1442, or 1443 is greater than the 
tax due by the withholding agent or the taxpayer, adjustments may be 
made in accordance with the procedures described in Sec. 1.1461-2(a). 
Alternatively, refunds or credits may be claimed in accordance with the 
procedures described in Sec. 1.1464-1, relating to refunds or credits 
claimed by the beneficial owner, or Sec. 1.6414-1, relating to refunds 
or credits claimed by the withholding agent. If an amount was withheld 
under section 3406 or is subsequently determined to have been paid to a 
foreign person, see paragraph (b)(3)(vii) of this section and Sec. 
31.6413(a)-3(a)(1) of this chapter.
    (9) Payments to joint owners. A payment to joint owners that 
requires documentation in order to reduce the rate of withholding under 
chapter 3 of the Code and the regulations thereunder does not qualify 
for such reduced rate unless the withholding agent can reliably 
associate the payment with documentation from each owner. 
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a payment to joint owners 
qualifies as a payment exempt from withholding under this section if any 
one of the owners provides a certificate of U.S. status on a Form W-9 in 
accordance with paragraph (d) (2) or (3) of this section or the 
withholding agent can associate the payment with an intermediary or 
flow-through withholding certificate upon which it can rely to treat the 
payment as made to a U.S. payee under paragraph (d)(4) of this section. 
See Sec. 31.3406(h)-2(a)(3)(i)(B) of this chapter.
    (c) Definitions--(1) Withholding. The term withholding means the 
deduction and withholding of tax at the applicable rate from the 
payment.
    (2) Foreign and U.S. person. The term foreign person means a 
nonresident alien individual, a foreign corporation, a foreign 
partnership, a foreign trust, a foreign estate, and any other person 
that is not a U.S. person described in the next sentence. Solely for 
purposes of the regulations under chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue 
Code, the term foreign person also means, with respect to a payment by a 
withholding agent, a foreign branch of a U.S. person that furnishes an 
intermediary withholding certificate described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) 
of this section. Such a branch continues to be a U.S. payor for purposes 
of chapter 61 of the Internal Revenue Code. See Sec. 1.6049-5(c)(4). A 
U.S. person is a person described in section 7701(a)(30), the U.S. 
government (including an agency or instrumentality thereof), a State 
(including an agency or instrumentality thereof), or the District of 
Columbia (including an agency or instrumentality thereof).
    (3) Individual--(i) Alien individual. The term alien individual 
means an individual who is not a citizen or a national of the United 
States. See Sec. 1.1-1(c).
    (ii) Nonresident alien individual. The term nonresident alien 
individual means a person described in section 7701(b)(1)(B), an alien 
individual who is a resident of a foreign country under the residence 
article of an income tax treaty and Sec. 301.7701(b)-7(a)(1) of this

[[Page 83]]

chapter, or an alien individual who is a resident of Puerto Rico, Guam, 
the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands, 
or American Samoa as determined under Sec. 301.7701(b)-1(d) of this 
chapter. An alien individual who has made an election under section 6013 
(g) or (h) to be treated as a resident of the United States is 
nevertheless treated as a nonresident alien individual for purposes of 
withholding under chapter 3 of the Code and the regulations thereunder.
    (4) Certain foreign corporations. For purposes of this section, a 
corporation created or organized in Guam, the Commonwealth of Northern 
Mariana Islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and American Samoa, is not 
treated as a foreign corporation if the requirements of sections 
881(b)(1) (A), (B), and (C) are met for such corporation. Further, a 
payment made to a foreign government or an international organization 
shall be treated as a payment made to a foreign corporation for purposes 
of withholding under chapter 3 of the Code and the regulations 
thereunder.
    (5) Financial institution and foreign financial institution. For 
purposes of the regulations under chapter 3 of the Code, the term 
financial institution means a person described in Sec. 1.165-
12(c)(1)(iv) (not including a person providing pension or other similar 
benefits or a regulated investment company or other mutual fund, unless 
otherwise indicated) and the term foreign financial institution means a 
financial institution that is a foreign person, as defined in paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section.
    (6) Beneficial owner--(i) General rule. This paragraph (c)(6) 
defines the term beneficial owner for payments of income other than a 
payment for which a reduced rate of withholding is claimed under an 
income tax treaty. The term beneficial owner means the person who is the 
owner of the income for tax purposes and who beneficially owns that 
income. A person shall be treated as the owner of the income to the 
extent that it is required under U.S. tax principles to include the 
amount paid in gross income under section 61 (determined without regard 
to an exclusion or exemption from gross income under the Internal 
Revenue Code). Beneficial ownership of income is determined under the 
provisions of section 7701(l) and the regulations under that section and 
any other applicable general U.S. tax principles, including principles 
governing the determination of whether a transaction is a conduit 
transaction. Thus, a person receiving income in a capacity as a nominee, 
agent, or custodian for another person is not the beneficial owner of 
the income. In the case of a scholarship, the student receiving the 
scholarship is the beneficial owner of that scholarship. In the case of 
a payment of an amount that is not income, the beneficial owner 
determination shall be made under this paragraph (c)(6) as if the amount 
were income.
    (ii) Special rules--(A) General rule. The beneficial owners of 
income paid to an entity described in this paragraph (c)(6)(ii) are 
those persons described in paragraphs (c)(6)(ii)(B) through (D) of this 
section.
    (B) Foreign partnerships. The beneficial owners of income paid to a 
foreign partnership (whether a nonwithholding or a withholding foreign 
partnership) are the partners in the partnership, unless they themselves 
are not the beneficial owners of the income under this paragraph (c)(6). 
For example, a partnership (first tier) that is a partner in another 
partnership (second tier) is not the beneficial owner of income paid to 
the second tier partnership since the first tier partnership is not the 
owner of the income under U.S. tax principles. Rather, the partners of 
the first tier partnership are the beneficial owners (to the extent they 
are not themselves persons that are not beneficial owners under this 
paragraph (c)(6)). See Sec. 1.1441-5(b) for applicable withholding 
procedures for payments to a domestic partnership. See also Sec. 
1.1441-5(c)(3)(ii) for applicable withholding procedures for payments to 
a foreign partnership where one of the partners (at any level in the 
chain of tiers) is a domestic partnership.
    (C) Foreign simple trusts and foreign grantor trusts. The beneficial 
owners of income paid to a foreign simple trust, as described in 
paragraph (c)(23) of this section, are the beneficiaries of the trust, 
unless they themselves are not the beneficial owners of the income

[[Page 84]]

under this paragraph (c)(6). The beneficial owners of income paid to a 
foreign grantor trust, as described in paragraph (c)(26) of this 
section, are the persons treated as the owners of the trust, unless they 
themselves are not the beneficial owners of the income under this 
paragraph (c)(6).
    (D) Other foreign trusts and foreign estates. The beneficial owner 
of income paid to a foreign complex trust as defined in paragraph 
(c)(25) of this section or to a foreign estate is the foreign complex 
trust or estate itself.
    (7) Withholding agent. For a definition of the term withholding 
agent and applicable rules, see Sec. 1.1441-7.
    (8) Person. For purposes of the regulations under chapter 3 of the 
Code, the term person shall mean a person described in section 
7701(a)(1) and the regulations under that section and a U.S. branch to 
the extent treated as a U.S. person under paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this 
section. For purposes of the regulations under chapter 3 of the Code, 
the term person does not include a wholly-owned entity that is 
disregarded for federal tax purposes under Sec. 301.7701-2(c)(2) of 
this chapter as an entity separate from its owner. See paragraph 
(b)(2)(iii) of this section for procedures applicable to payments to 
such entities.
    (9) Source of income. The source of income is determined under the 
provisions of part I (section 861 and following) , subchapter N, chapter 
1 of the Code and the regulations under those provisions.
    (10) Chapter 3 of the Code. For purposes of the regulations under 
sections 1441, 1442, and 1443, any reference to chapter 3 of the Code 
shall not include references to sections 1445 and 1446, unless the 
context indicates otherwise.
    (11) Reduced rate. For purposes of regulations under chapter 3 of 
the Code, and other withholding provisions of the Code, the term reduced 
rate, when used in regulations under chapter 3 of the Code, shall 
include an exemption from tax.
    (12) Payee. For purposes of chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code, 
the term payee of a payment is determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section, Sec. 1.1441-5(c)(1) (relating to partnerships), and Sec. 
1.1441-5(e)(2) and (3) (relating to trusts and estates) and includes 
foreign persons, U.S. exempt recipients, and U.S. non-exempt recipients. 
A nonqualified intermediary and a qualified intermediary (to the extent 
it does not assume primary withholding responsibility) are not payees if 
they are acting as intermediaries and not the beneficial owner of 
income. In addition, a flow-through entity is not a payee unless the 
income is (or is deemed to be) effectively connected with the conduct of 
a trade or business in the United States. See Sec. 1.6049-5(d)(1) for 
rules to determine the payee for purposes of chapter 61 of the Internal 
Revenue Code. See Sec. Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3), 1.1441-5(d), and (e)(6) and 
1.6049-5(d)(3) for presumption rules that apply if a payee's identity 
cannot be determined on the basis of valid documentation.
    (13) Intermediary. An intermediary means, with respect to a payment 
that it receives, a person that, for that payment, acts as a custodian, 
broker, nominee, or otherwise as an agent for another person, regardless 
of whether such other person is the beneficial owner of the amount paid, 
a flow-through entity, or another intermediary.
    (14) Nonqualified intermediary. A nonqualified intermediary means 
any intermediary that is not a U.S. person and not a qualified 
intermediary, as defined in paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of this section, or a 
qualified intermediary that is not acting in its capacity as a qualified 
intermediary with respect to a payment. For example, to the extent an 
entity that is a qualified intermediary provides another withholding 
agent with a foreign beneficial owner withholding certificate as defined 
in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, the entity is not acting in its 
capacity as a qualified intermediary. Notwithstanding the preceding 
sentence, a qualified intermediary is acting as a qualified intermediary 
to the extent it provides another withholding agent with Forms W-9, or 
other information regarding U.S. non-exempt recipients pursuant to its 
qualified intermediary agreement with the IRS.
    (15) Qualified intermediary. The term qualified intermediary is 
defined in paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of this section.

[[Page 85]]

    (16) Withholding certificate. The term withholding certificate means 
a Form W-8 described in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section (relating to 
foreign beneficial owners), paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section 
(relating to foreign intermediaries), Sec. 1.1441-5(c)(2)(iv), 
(c)(3)(iii), and (e)(3)(iv) (relating to flow-through entities), a Form 
8233 described in Sec. 1.1441-4(b)(2), a Form W-9 as described in 
paragraph (d) of this section, a statement described in Sec. 1.871-
14(c)(2)(v) (relating to portfolio interest), or any other certificates 
that under the Internal Revenue Code or regulations certifies or 
establishes the status of a payee or beneficial owner as a U.S. or a 
foreign person.
    (17) Documentary evidence; other appropriate documentation. The 
terms documentary evidence or other appropriate documentation refer to 
documents other than a withholding certificate that may be provided for 
payments made outside the United States to offshore accounts or any 
other evidence that under the Internal Revenue Code or regulations 
certifies or establishes the status of a payee or beneficial owner as a 
U.S. or foreign person. See Sec. Sec. 1.1441-6(b)(2), (c)(3) and (4) 
(relating to treaty benefits), and 1.6049-5(c)(1) and (4) (relating to 
chapter 61 reporting). Also see Sec. 1.1441-4(a)(3)(ii) regarding 
documentary evidence for notional principal contracts.
    (18) Documentation. The term documentation refers to both 
withholding certificates, as defined in paragraph (c)(16) of this 
section, and documentary evidence or other appropriate documentation, as 
defined in paragraph (c)(17) of this section.
    (19) Payor. The term payor is defined in Sec. 31.3406(a)-2 of this 
chapter and Sec. 1.6049-4(a)(2) and generally includes a withholding 
agent, as defined in Sec. 1.1441-7(a). The term also includes any 
person that makes a payment to an intermediary, flow-through entity, or 
U.S. branch that is not treated as a U.S. person to the extent the 
intermediary, flow-through, or U.S. branch provides a Form W-9 or other 
appropriate information relating to a payee so that the payment can be 
reported under chapter 61 of the Internal Revenue Code and, if required, 
subject to backup withholding under section 3406. This latter rule does 
not preclude the intermediary, flow-through entity, or U.S. branch from 
also being a payor.
    (20) Exempt recipient. The term exempt recipient means a person that 
is exempt from reporting under chapter 61 of the Internal Revenue Code 
and backup withholding under section 3406 and that is described in 
Sec. Sec. 1.6041-3(q), 1.6045-2(b)(2)(i), and 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii), and 
Sec. 5f.6045-1(c)(3)(i)(B) of this chapter. Exempt recipients are not 
exempt from withholding under chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code 
unless they are U.S. persons or foreign persons entitled to an exemption 
from withholding under chapter 3.
    (21) Non-exempt recipient. A non-exempt recipient is any person that 
is not an exempt recipient under paragraph (c)(20) of this section.
    (22) Reportable amounts. Reportable amounts are defined in paragraph 
(e)(3)(vi) of this section.
    (23) Flow-through entity. A flow-through entity means any entity 
that is described in this paragraph (c)(23) and that may provide 
documentation on behalf of others to a withholding agent. The entities 
described in this paragraph are a foreign partnership (other than a 
withholding foreign partnership), a foreign simple trust (other than a 
withholding foreign trust) that is described in paragraph (c)(24) of 
this section, a foreign grantor trust (other than a withholding foreign 
trust) that is described in paragraph (c)(25) of this section, or, for 
any payments for which a reduced rate of withholding under an income tax 
treaty is claimed, any entity to the extent the entity is considered to 
be fiscally transparent under section 894 with respect to the payment by 
an interest holder's jurisdiction.
    (24) Foreign simple trust. A foreign simple trust is a foreign trust 
that is described in section 651(a).
    (25) Foreign complex trust. A foreign complex trust is a foreign 
trust other than a trust described in section 651(a) or sections 671 
through 679.
    (26) Foreign grantor trust. A foreign grantor trust is a foreign 
trust but only to the extent all or a portion of the income of the trust 
is treated as owned by the grantor or another person under sections 671 
through 679.

[[Page 86]]

    (27) Partnership. The term partnership means any entity treated as a 
partnership under Sec. 301.7701-2 or -3 of this chapter.
    (28) Nonwithholding foreign partnership. A nonwithholding foreign 
partnership is a foreign partnership that is not a withholding foreign 
partnership, as defined in Sec. 1.1441-5(c)(2)(i).
    (29) Withholding foreign partnership. A withholding foreign 
partnership is defined in Sec. 1.1441-5(c)(2)(i).
    (d) Beneficial owner's or payee's claim of U.S. status--(1) In 
general. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a withholding agent is 
not required to withhold under chapter 3 of the Code on payments to a 
U.S. payee, to a person presumed to be a U.S. payee in accordance with 
the provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, or to a person that 
the withholding agent may treat as a U.S. beneficial owner of the 
payment. Absent actual knowledge or reason to know otherwise, a 
withholding agent may rely on the provisions of this paragraph (d) in 
order to determine whether to treat a payee or beneficial owner as a 
U.S. person.
    (2) Payments for which a Form W-9 is otherwise required. A 
withholding agent may treat as a U.S. payee any person who is required 
to furnish a Form W-9 and who furnishes it in accordance with the 
procedures described in Sec. Sec. 31.3406(d)-1 through 31.3406(d)-5 of 
this chapter (including the requirement that the payee furnish its 
taxpayer identifying number (TIN)) if the withholding agent meets all 
the requirements described in Sec. 31.3406(h)-3(e) of this chapter 
regarding reliance by a payor on a Form W-9. Providing a Form W-9 or 
valid substitute form shall serve as a statement that the person whose 
name is on the form is a U.S. person. Therefore, a foreign person, 
including a U.S. branch treated as a U.S. person under paragraph 
(b)(2)(iv) of this section, shall not provide a Form W-9. A U.S. branch 
of a foreign person may establish its status as a foreign person exempt 
from reporting under chapter 61 and backup withholding under section 
3406 by providing a withholding certificate on Form W-8.
    (3) Payments for which a Form W-9 is not otherwise required. In the 
case of a payee who is not required to furnish a Form W-9 under section 
3406 (e.g., a person exempt from reporting under chapter 61 of the 
Internal Revenue Code), the withholding agent may treat the payee as a 
U.S. payee if the payee provides the withholding agent with a Form W-9 
or a substitute form described in Sec. 31.3406(h)-3(c)(2) of this 
chapter (relating to forms for exempt recipients) that contains the 
payee's name, address, and TIN. The form must be signed under penalties 
of perjury by the payee if so required by the form or by Sec. 
31.3406(h)-3 of this chapter. Providing a Form W-9 or valid substitute 
form shall serve as a statement that the person whose name is on the 
certificate is a U.S. person. A Form W-9 or valid substitute form shall 
not be provided by a foreign person, including any U.S. branch of a 
foreign person whether or not the branch is treated as a U.S. person 
under paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section. See paragraph (e)(3)(v) of 
this section for withholding certificates provided by U.S. branches 
described in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section. The procedures 
described in Sec. 31.3406(h)-2(a) of this chapter shall apply to 
payments to joint payees. A withholding agent that receives a Form W-9 
to satisfy this paragraph (d)(3) must retain the form in accordance with 
the provisions of Sec. 31.3406(h)-3(g) of this chapter, if applicable, 
or of paragraph (e)(4)(iii) of this section (relating to the retention 
of withholding certificates) if Sec. 31.3406(h)-3(g) of this chapter 
does not apply. The rules of this paragraph (d)(3) are only intended to 
provide a method by which a withholding agent may determine that a payee 
is a U.S. person and do not otherwise impose a requirement that 
documentation be furnished by a person who is otherwise treated as an 
exempt recipient for purposes of the applicable information reporting 
provisions under chapter 61 of the Internal Revenue Code (e.g., Sec. 
1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii) for payments of interest).
    (4) When a payment to an intermediary or flow-through entity may be 
treated as made to a U.S. payee. A withholding agent that makes a 
payment to an intermediary (whether a qualified intermediary or 
nonqualified intermediary), a flow-through entity, or a U.S. branch 
described in paragraph

[[Page 87]]

(b)(2)(iv) of this section may treat the payment as made to a U.S. payee 
to the extent that, prior to the payment, the withholding agent can 
reliably associate the payment with a Form W-9 described in paragraph 
(d)(2) or (3) of this section attached to a valid intermediary, flow-
through, or U.S. branch withholding certificate described in paragraph 
(e)(3)(i) of this section or to the extent the withholding agent can 
reliably associate the payment with a Form W-8 described in paragraph 
(e)(3)(v) of this section that evidences an agreement to treat a U.S. 
branch described in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section as a U.S. 
person. In addition, a withholding agent may treat the payment as made 
to a U.S. payee only if it complies with the electronic confirmation 
procedures described in paragraph (e)(4)(v) of this section, if 
required, and it has not been notified by the IRS that any of the 
information on the withholding certificate or other documentation is 
incorrect or unreliable. In the case of a Form W-9 that is required to 
be furnished for a reportable payment that may be subject to backup 
withholding, the withholding agent may be notified in accordance with 
section 3406(a)(1)(B) and the regulations under that section. See 
applicable procedures under section 3406(a)(1)(B) and the regulations 
under that section for payors who have been notified with regard to such 
a Form W-9. Withholding agents who have been notified in relation to 
other Forms W-9, including under section 6724(b) pursuant to section 
6721, may rely on the withholding certificate or other documentation 
only to the extent provided under procedures as prescribed by the IRS 
(see Sec. 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter).
    (e) Beneficial owner's claim of foreign status--(1) Withholding 
agent's reliance--(i) In general. Absent actual knowledge or reason to 
know otherwise, a withholding agent may treat a payment as made to a 
foreign beneficial owner in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 
(e)(1)(ii) of this section. See paragraph (e)(4)(viii) of this section 
for applicable reliance rules. See paragraph (b)(4) of this section for 
a description of payments for which a claim of foreign status is 
relevant for purposes of claiming a reduced rate of withholding for 
purposes of section 1441, 1442, or 1443. See paragraph (b)(5) of this 
section for a list of payments for which a claim of foreign status is 
relevant for other purposes, such as claiming an exemption from 
information reporting under chapter 61 of the Code.
    (ii) Payments that a withholding agent may treat as made to a 
foreign person that is a beneficial owner--(A) General rule. The 
withholding agent may treat a payment as made to a foreign person that 
is a beneficial owner if it complies with the requirements described in 
paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(B) of this section and, then, only to the extent--
    (1) That the withholding agent can reliably associate the payment 
with a beneficial owner withholding certificate described in paragraph 
(e)(2) of this section furnished by the person whose name is on the 
certificate or attached to a valid foreign intermediary, flow-through, 
or U.S. branch withholding certificate;
    (2) That the payment is made outside the United States (within the 
meaning of Sec. 1.6049-5(e)) to an offshore account (within the meaning 
of Sec. 1.6049-5(c)(1)) and the withholding agent can reliably 
associate the payment with documentary evidence described in Sec. Sec. 
1.1441-6(c)(3) or (4), or 1.6049-5(c)(1) relating to the beneficial 
owner;
    (3) That the withholding agent can reliably associate the payment 
with a valid qualified intermediary withholding certificate, as 
described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, and the qualified 
intermediary has provided sufficient information for the withholding 
agent to allocate the payment to a withholding rate pool other than a 
withholding rate pool or pools established for U.S. non-exempt 
recipients;
    (4) That the withholding agent can reliably associate the payment 
with a withholding certificate described in Sec. 1.1441-5(c)(3)(iii) or 
(e)(5)(iii) from a flow-through entity claiming the income is 
effectively connected income;
    (5) That the withholding agent identifies the payee as a U.S. branch 
described in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section, the payment to which 
it treats as effectively connected income in accordance with Sec. 
1.1441-4(a) (2)(ii) or (3);

[[Page 88]]

    (6) That the withholding agent identifies the payee as an 
international organization (or any wholly-owned agency or 
instrumentality thereof) as defined in section 7701(a)(18) that has been 
designated as such by executive order (pursuant to 22 U.S.C. 288 through 
288(f)); or
    (7) That the withholding agent pays interest from bankers' 
acceptances and identifies the payee as a foreign central bank of issue 
(as defined in Sec. 1.861-2(b)(4)).
    (B) Additional requirements. In order for a payment described in 
paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(A) of this section to be treated as made to a 
foreign beneficial owner, the withholding agent must hold the 
documentation (if required) prior to the payment, comply with the 
electronic confirmation procedures described in paragraph (e)(4)(v) of 
this section (if required), and must not have been notified by the IRS 
that any of the information on the withholding certificate or other 
documentation is incorrect or unreliable. If the withholding agent has 
been so notified, it may rely on the withholding certificate or other 
documentation only to the extent provided under procedures prescribed by 
the IRS (see Sec. 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter). See paragraph 
(b)(2)(vii) of this section for rules regarding reliable association of 
a payment with a withholding certificate or other appropriate 
documentation.
    (2) Beneficial owner withholding certificate--(i) In general. A 
beneficial owner withholding certificate is a statement by which the 
beneficial owner of the payment represents that it is a foreign person 
and, if applicable, claims a reduced rate of withholding under section 
1441. A separate withholding certificate must be submitted to each 
withholding agent. If the beneficial owner receives more than one type 
of payment from a single withholding agent, the beneficial owner may 
have to submit more than one withholding certificate to the single 
withholding agent for the different types of payments as may be required 
by the applicable forms and instructions, or as the withholding agent 
may require (such as to facilitate the withholding agent's compliance 
with its obligations to determine withholding under this section or the 
reporting of the amounts under Sec. 1.1461-1 (b) and (c)). For example, 
if a beneficial owner claims that some but not all of the income it 
receives is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or 
business in the United States, it may be required to submit two separate 
withholding certificates, one for income that is not effectively 
connected and one for income that is so connected. See Sec. 1.1441-
6(b)(2) for special rules for determining who must furnish a beneficial 
owner withholding certificate when a benefit is claimed under an income 
tax treaty. See paragraph (e)(4)(ix) of this section for reliance rules 
in the case of certificates held by another person or at a different 
branch location of the same person.
    (ii) Requirements for validity of certificate. A beneficial owner 
withholding certificate is valid only if it is provided on a Form W-8, 
or a Form 8233 in the case of personal services income described in 
Sec. 1.1441-4(b) or certain scholarship or grant amounts described in 
Sec. 1.1441-4(c) (or a substitute form described in paragraph 
(e)(4)(vi) of this section, or such other form as the IRS may 
prescribe). A Form W-8 is valid only if its validity period has not 
expired, it is signed under penalties of perjury by the beneficial 
owner, and it contains all of the information required on the form. The 
required information is the beneficial owner's name, permanent residence 
address, and TIN (if required), the country under the laws of which the 
beneficial owner is created, incorporated, or governed (if a person 
other than an individual), the classification of the entity, and such 
other information as may be required by the regulations under section 
1441 or by the form or accompanying instructions in addition to, or in 
lieu of, the information described in this paragraph (e)(2)(ii). A 
person's permanent residence address is an address in the country where 
the person claims to be a resident for purposes of that country's income 
tax. In the case of a certificate furnished in order to claim a reduced 
rate of withholding under an income tax treaty, the residence must be 
determined in the manner prescribed under the applicable treaty.

[[Page 89]]

See Sec. 1.1441-6(b). The address of a financial institution with which 
the beneficial owner maintains an account, a post office box, or an 
address used solely for mailing purposes is not a residence address for 
this purpose. If the beneficial owner is an individual who does not have 
a tax residence in any country, the permanent residence address is the 
place at which the beneficial owner normally resides. If the beneficial 
owner is not an individual and does not have a tax residence in any 
country, then the permanent residence address is the place at which the 
person maintains its principal office. See paragraph (e)(4)(vii) of this 
section for circumstances in which a TIN is required on a beneficial 
owner withholding certificate. See paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section 
for continued validity of certificates during a transition period.
    (3) Intermediary, flow-through, or U.S. branch withholding 
certificate--(i) In general. An intermediary withholding certificate is 
a Form W-8 by which a payee represents that it is a foreign person and 
that it is an intermediary (whether a qualified or nonqualified 
intermediary) with respect to a payment and not the beneficial owner. 
See paragraphs (e)(3)(ii) and (iii) of this section. A flow-through 
withholding certificate is a Form W-8 used by a flow-through entity as 
defined in paragraph (c)(23) of this section. See Sec. 1.1441-
5(c)(3)(iii) (a nonwithholding foreign partnership), Sec. 1.1441-
5(e)(5)(iii) (a foreign simple trust or foreign grantor trust) or Sec. 
1.1441-6(b)(2) (foreign entity presenting claims on behalf of its 
interest holders for a reduced rate of withholding under an income tax 
treaty). A U.S. branch certificate is a Form W-8 furnished under 
paragraph (e)(3)(v) of this section by a U.S. branch described in 
paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section. See paragraph (e)(4)(viii) of this 
section for applicable reliance rules.
    (ii) Intermediary withholding certificate from a qualified 
intermediary. A qualified intermediary shall provide a qualified 
intermediary withholding certificate for reportable amounts received by 
the qualified intermediary. See paragraph (e)(3)(vi) of this section for 
the definition of reportable amount. A qualified intermediary 
withholding certificate is valid only if it is furnished on a Form W-8, 
an acceptable substitute form, or such other form as the IRS may 
prescribe, it is signed under penalties of perjury by a person with 
authority to sign for the qualified intermediary, its validity has not 
expired, and it contains the following information, statement, and 
certifications--
    (A) The name, permanent residence address (as described in paragraph 
(e)(2)(ii) of this section), qualified intermediary employer 
identification number (QI-EIN), and the country under the laws of which 
the intermediary is created, incorporated, or governed. A qualified 
intermediary that does not act in its capacity as a qualified 
intermediary must not use its QI-EIN. Rather the intermediary should 
provide a nonqualified intermediary withholding certificate, if it is 
acting as an intermediary, and should use the taxpayer identification 
number, if any, that it uses for all other purposes;
    (B) A certification that, with respect to accounts it identifies on 
its withholding statement (as described in paragraph (e)(5)(v) of this 
section), the qualified intermediary is not acting for its own account 
but is acting as a qualified intermediary;
    (C) A certification that the qualified intermediary has provided, or 
will provide, a withholding statement as required by paragraph (e)(5)(v) 
of this section; and
    (D) Any other information, certifications, or statements as may be 
required by the form or accompanying instructions in addition to, or in 
lieu of, the information and certifications described in this paragraph 
(e)(3)(ii) or paragraph (e)(3)(v) of this section. See paragraph 
(e)(5)(v) of this section for the requirements of a withholding 
statement associated with the qualified intermediary withholding 
certificate.
    (iii) Intermediary withholding certificate from a nonqualified 
intermediary. A nonqualified intermediary shall provide a nonqualified 
intermediary withholding certificate for reportable amounts received by 
the nonqualified intermediary. See paragraph (e)(3)(vi)

[[Page 90]]

of this section for the definition of reportable amount. A nonqualified 
intermediary withholding certificate is valid only to the extent it is 
furnished on a Form W-8, an acceptable substitute form, or such other 
form as the IRS may prescribe, it is signed under penalties of perjury 
by a person authorized to sign for the nonqualified intermediary, it 
contains the information, statements, and certifications described in 
this paragraph (e)(3)(iii) and paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this section, its 
validity has not expired, and the withholding certificates and other 
appropriate documentation for all persons to whom the certificate 
relates are associated with the certificate. Withholding certificates 
and other appropriate documentation consist of beneficial owner 
withholding certificates described in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this 
section, intermediary and flow-through withholding certificates 
described in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, withholding foreign 
partnership certificates described in Sec. 1.1441-5(c)(2)(iv), 
documentary evidence described in Sec. Sec. 1.1441-6(c)(3) or (4) and 
1.6049-5(c)(1), and any other documentation or certificates applicable 
under other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code or regulations that 
certify or establish the status of the payee or beneficial owner as a 
U.S. or a foreign person. If a nonqualified intermediary is acting on 
behalf of another nonqualified intermediary or a flow-through entity, 
then the nonqualified intermediary must associate with its own 
withholding certificate the other nonqualified intermediary withholding 
certificate or the flow-through withholding certificate and separately 
identify all of the withholding certificates and other appropriate 
documentation that are associated with the withholding certificate of 
the other nonqualified intermediary or flow-through entity. Nothing in 
this paragraph (e)(3)(iii) shall require an intermediary to furnish 
original documentation. Copies of certificates or documentary evidence 
may be transmitted to the U.S. withholding agent, in which case the 
nonqualified intermediary must retain the original documentation for the 
same time period that the copy is required to be retained by the 
withholding agent under paragraph (e)(4)(iii) of this section and must 
provide it to the withholding agent upon request. For purposes of this 
paragraph (e)(3)(iii), a valid intermediary withholding certificate also 
includes a statement described in Sec. 1.871-14(c)(2)(v) furnished for 
interest to qualify as portfolio interest for purposes of sections 
871(h) and 881(c). The information and certifications required on a Form 
W-8 described in this paragraph (e)(3)(iii) are as follows--
    (A) The name and permanent resident address (as described in 
paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section) of the nonqualified intermediary, 
and the country under the laws of which the nonqualified intermediary is 
created, incorporated, or governed;
    (B) A certification that the nonqualified intermediary is not acting 
for its own account;
    (C) If the nonqualified intermediary withholding certificate is used 
to transmit withholding certificates or other appropriate documentation 
for more than one person on whose behalf the nonqualified intermediary 
is acting, a withholding statement associated with the Form W-8 that 
provides all the information required by paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this 
section; and
    (D) Any other information, certifications, or statements as may be 
required by the form or accompanying instructions in addition to, or in 
lieu of, the information, certifications, and statements described in 
this paragraph (e)(3)(iii) or paragraph (e)(5)(iv) of this section.
    (iv) Withholding statement provided by nonqualified intermediary--
(A) In general. A nonqualified intermediary shall provide a withholding 
statement required by this paragraph (e)(3)(iv) to the extent the 
nonqualified intermediary is required to furnish, or does furnish, 
documentation for payees on whose behalf it receives reportable amounts 
(as defined in paragraph (e)(3)(vi) of this section) or to the extent it 
otherwise provides the documentation of such payees to a withholding 
agent. A nonqualified intermediary is not required to disclose 
information regarding persons for whom it collects reportable amounts 
unless it has actual knowledge that any such person is a U.S. non-exempt 
recipient

[[Page 91]]

as defined in paragraph (c)(21) of this section. Information regarding 
U.S. non-exempt recipients required under this paragraph (e)(3)(iv) must 
be provided irrespective of any requirement under foreign law that 
prohibits the disclosure of the identity of an account holder of a 
nonqualified intermediary or financial information relating to such 
account holder. Although a nonqualified intermediary is not required to 
provide documentation and other information required by this paragraph 
(e)(3)(iv) for persons other than U.S. non-exempt recipients, a 
withholding agent that does not receive documentation and such 
information must apply the presumption rules of paragraph (b) of this 
section, Sec. Sec. 1.1441-5(d) and (e)(6) and 1.6049-5(d) or the 
withholding agent shall be liable for tax, interest, and penalties. A 
withholding agent must apply the presumption rules even if it is not 
required under chapter 61 of the Internal Revenue Code to obtain 
documentation to treat a payee as an exempt recipient and even though it 
has actual knowledge that the payee is a U.S. person. For example, if a 
nonqualified intermediary fails to provide a withholding agent with a 
Form W-9 for an account holder that is a U.S. exempt recipient, the 
withholding agent must presume (even if it has actual knowledge that the 
account holder is a U.S. exempt recipient), that the account holder is 
an undocumented foreign person with respect to amounts subject to 
withholding. See paragraph (b)(3)(v) of this section for applicable 
presumptions. Therefore, the withholding agent must withhold 30 percent 
from the payment even though if a Form W-9 had been provided, no 
withholding or reporting on the payment attributable to a U.S. exempt 
recipient would apply. Further, a nonqualified intermediary that fails 
to provide the documentation and the information under this paragraph 
(e)(3)(iv) for another withholding agent to report the payments on Forms 
1042-S and Forms 1099 is not relieved of its responsibility to file 
information returns. See paragraph (b)(6) of this section. Therefore, 
unless the nonqualified intermediary itself files such returns and 
provides copies to the payees, it shall be liable for penalties under 
sections 6721 (failure to file information returns), and 6722 (failure 
to furnish payee statements), including the penalties under those 
sections for intentional failure to file information returns. In 
addition, failure to provide either the documentation or the information 
required by this paragraph (e)(3)(iv) results in a payment not being 
reliably associated with valid documentation. Therefore, the beneficial 
owners of the payment are not entitled to reduced rates of withholding 
and if the full amount required to be held under the presumption rules 
is not withheld by the withholding agent, the nonqualified intermediary 
must withhold the difference between the amount withheld by the 
withholding agent and the amount required to be withheld. Failure to 
withhold shall result in the nonqualified intermediary being liable for 
tax under section 1461, interest, and penalties, including penalties 
under section 6656 (failure to deposit) and section 6672 (failure to 
collect and pay over tax).
    (B) General requirements. A withholding statement must be provided 
prior to the payment of a reportable amount and must contain the 
information specified in paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(C) of this section. The 
statement must be updated as often as required to keep the information 
in the withholding statement correct prior to each subsequent payment. 
The withholding statement forms an integral part of the withholding 
certificate provided under paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section, and 
the penalties of perjury statement provided on the withholding 
certificate shall apply to the withholding statement. The withholding 
statement may be provided in any manner the nonqualified intermediary 
and the withholding agent mutually agree, including electronically. If 
the withholding statement is provided electronically, there must be 
sufficient safeguards to ensure that the information received by the 
withholding agent is the information sent by the nonqualified 
intermediary and all occasions of user access that result in the 
submission or modification of the withholding statement information must 
be recorded. In addition, an electronic system must be capable of 
providing a hard copy of all withholding statements provided by

[[Page 92]]

the nonqualified intermediary. A withholding agent will be liable for 
tax, interest, and penalties in accordance with paragraph (b)(7) of this 
section to the extent it does not follow the presumption rules of 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section or Sec. Sec. 1.1441-5(d) and (e)(6), 
and 1.6049-5(d) for any payment of a reportable amount, or portion 
thereof, for which it does not have a valid withholding statement prior 
to making a payment.
    (C) Content of withholding statement. The withholding statement 
provided by a nonqualified intermediary must contain the information 
required by this paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(C).
    (1) The withholding statement must contain the name, address, TIN 
(if any) and the type of documentation (documentary evidence, Form W-9, 
or type of Form W-8) for every person from whom documentation has been 
received by the nonqualified intermediary and provided to the 
withholding agent and whether that person is a U.S. exempt recipient, a 
U.S. non-exempt recipient, or a foreign person. See paragraphs (c)(2), 
(20), and (21) of this section for the definitions of foreign person, 
U.S. exempt recipient, and U.S. non-exempt recipient. In the case of a 
foreign person, the statement must indicate whether the foreign person 
is a beneficial owner or an intermediary, flow-through entity, or U.S. 
branch described in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section and include the 
type of recipient, based on recipient codes used for filing Forms 1042-
S, if the foreign person is a recipient as defined in Sec. 1.1461-
1(c)(1)(ii).
    (2) The withholding statement must allocate each payment, by income 
type, to every payee (including U.S. exempt recipients) for whom 
documentation has been provided. Any payment that cannot be reliably 
associated with valid documentation from a payee shall be treated as 
made to an unknown payee in accordance with the presumption rules of 
paragraph (b) of this section and Sec. Sec. 1.1441-5(d) and (e)(6) and 
1.6049-5(d). For this purpose, a type of income is determined by the 
types of income required to be reported on Forms 1042-S or 1099, as 
appropriate. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, deposit interest 
(including original issue discount) described in section 871(i)(2)(A) or 
881(d) and interest or original issue discount on short-term obligations 
as described in section 871(g)(1)(B) or 881(e) is only required to be 
allocated to the extent it is required to be reported on Form 1099 or 
Form 1042-S. See Sec. 1.6049-8 (regarding reporting of bank deposit 
interest to certain foreign persons). If a payee receives income through 
another nonqualified intermediary, flow-through entity, or U.S. branch 
described in paragraph (e)(2)(iv) of this section (other than a U.S. 
branch treated as a U.S. person), the withholding statement must also 
state, with respect to the payee, the name, address, and TIN, if known, 
of the other nonqualified intermediary or U.S. branch from which the 
payee directly receives the payment or the flow-through entity in which 
the payee has a direct ownership interest. If another nonqualified 
intermediary, flow-through entity, or U.S. branch fails to allocate a 
payment, the name of the nonqualified intermediary, flow-through entity, 
or U.S. branch that failed to allocate the payment shall be provided 
with respect to such payment.
    (3) If a payee is identified as a foreign person, the nonqualified 
intermediary must specify the rate of withholding to which the payee is 
subject, the payee's country of residence and, if a reduced rate of 
withholding is claimed, the basis for that reduced rate (e.g., treaty 
benefit, portfolio interest, exempt under section 501(c)(3), 892, or 
895). The allocation statement must also include the taxpayer 
identification numbers of those foreign persons for whom such a number 
is required under paragraph (e)(4)(vii) of this section or Sec. 1.1441-
6(b)(1) (regarding claims for treaty benefits). In the case of a claim 
of treaty benefits, the nonqualified intermediary's withholding 
statement must also state whether the limitation on benefits and section 
894 statements required by Sec. 1.1441-6(c)(5) have been provided, if 
required, in the beneficial owner's Form W-8 or associated with such 
owner's documentary evidence.
    (4) The withholding statement must also contain any other 
information the withholding agent reasonably requests in order to 
fulfill its obligations under

[[Page 93]]

chapter 3, chapter 61 of the Internal Revenue Code, and section 3406.
    (D) Alternative procedures--(1) In general. Under the alternative 
procedures of this paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(D), a nonqualified intermediary 
may provide information allocating a payment of a reportable amount to 
each payee (including U.S. exempt recipients) otherwise required under 
paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(B)(2) of this section after a payment is made. To 
use the alternative procedure of this paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(D), the 
nonqualified intermediary must inform the withholding agent on a 
statement associated with its nonqualified intermediary withholding 
certificate that it is using the procedure under this paragraph 
(e)(3)(iv)(D) and the withholding agent must agree to the procedure. If 
the requirements of the alternative procedure are met, a withholding 
agent, including the nonqualified intermediary using the procedures, can 
treat the payment as reliably associated with documentation and, 
therefore, the presumption rules of paragraph (b)(3) of this section and 
Sec. Sec. 1.1441-5(d) and (e)(6) and 1.6049-5(d) do not apply even 
though information allocating the payment to each payee has not been 
received prior to the payment. See paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(D)(7) of this 
section, however, for a nonqualified intermediary's liability for tax 
and penalties if the requirements of this paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(D) are 
not met. These alternative procedures shall not be used for payments 
that are allocable to U.S. non-exempt recipients. Therefore, a 
nonqualified intermediary is required to provide a withholding agent 
with information allocating payments of reportable amounts to U.S. non-
exempt recipients prior to the payment being made by the withholding 
agent.
    (2) Withholding rate pools. In place of the information required in 
paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(C)(2) of this section allocating payments to each 
payee, the nonqualified intermediary must provide a withholding agent 
with withholding rate pool information prior to the payment of a 
reportable amount. The withholding statement must contain all other 
information required by paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(C) of this section. 
Further, each payee listed in the withholding statement must be assigned 
to an identified withholding rate pool. To the extent a nonqualified 
intermediary is required to, or does provide, documentation, the 
alternative procedures do not relieve the nonqualified intermediary from 
the requirement to provide documentation prior to the payment being 
made. Therefore, withholding certificates or other appropriate 
documentation and all information required by paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(C) of 
this section (other than allocation information) must be provided to a 
withholding agent before any new payee receives a reportable amount. In 
addition, the withholding statement must be updated by assigning a new 
payee to a withholding rate pool prior to the payment of a reportable 
amount. A withholding rate pool is a payment of a single type of income, 
determined in accordance with the categories of income used to file Form 
1042-S, that is subject to a single rate of withholding. A withholding 
rate pool may be established by any reasonable method to which the 
nonqualified intermediary and a withholding agent agree (e.g., by 
establishing a separate account for a single withholding rate pool, or 
by dividing a payment made to a single account into portions allocable 
to each withholding rate pool). The nonqualified intermediary shall 
determine withholding rate pools based on valid documentation or, to the 
extent a payment cannot be reliably associated with valid documentation, 
the presumption rules of paragraph (b)(3) of this section and Sec. Sec. 
1.1441-5(d) and (e)(6) and 1.6049-5(d).
    (3) Allocation information. The nonqualified intermediary must 
provide the withholding agent with sufficient information to allocate 
the income in each withholding rate pool to each payee (including U.S. 
exempt recipients) within the pool no later than January 31 of the year 
following the year of payment. Any payments that are not allocated to 
payees for whom documentation has been provided shall be allocated to an 
undocumented payee in accordance with the presumption rules of paragraph 
(b)(3) of this section and Sec. Sec. 1.1441-5(d) and (e)(6) and 1.6049-
5(d). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, deposit interest 
(including

[[Page 94]]

original issue discount) described in section 871(i)(2)(A) or 881(d) and 
interest or original issue discount on short-term obligations as 
described in section 871(g)(1)(B) or 881(e) is not required to be 
allocated to a U.S. exempt recipient or a foreign payee, except as 
required under Sec. 1.6049-8 (regarding reporting of deposit interest 
paid to certain foreign persons).
    (4) Failure to provide allocation information. If a nonqualified 
intermediary fails to provide allocation information, if required, by 
January 31 for any withholding rate pool, a withholding agent shall not 
apply the alternative procedures of this paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(D) to any 
payments of reportable amounts paid after January 31 in the taxable year 
following the calendar year for which allocation information was not 
given and any subsequent taxable year. Further, the alternative 
procedures shall be unavailable for any other withholding rate pool even 
though allocation information was given for that other pool. Therefore, 
the withholding agent must withhold on a payment of a reportable amount 
in accordance with the presumption rules of paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section, and Sec. Sec. 1.1441-5(d) and (e)(6) and 1.6049-5(d), unless 
the nonqualified intermediary provides all of the information, including 
information sufficient to allocate the payment to each specific payee, 
required by paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(A) through (C) of this section prior to 
the payment. A nonqualified intermediary must allocate at least 90 
percent of the income required to be allocated for each withholding rate 
pool or the nonqualified intermediary will be treated as having failed 
to provide allocation information for purposes of this paragraph 
(e)(3)(iv)(D). See paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(D)(7) of this section for 
liability for tax and penalties if a nonqualified intermediary fails to 
provide allocation information in whole or in part.
    (5) Cure provision. A nonqualified intermediary may cure any failure 
to provide allocation information by providing the required allocation 
information to the withholding agent no later than February 14 following 
the calendar year of payment. If the withholding agent receives the 
allocation information by that date, it may apply the adjustment 
procedures of Sec. 1.1461-2 to any excess withholding for payments made 
on or after February 1 and on or before February 14. Any nonqualified 
intermediary that fails to cure by February 14, may request the ability 
to use the alternative procedures of this paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(D) by 
submitting a request, in writing, to the Assistant Commissioner 
(International). The request must state the reason that the nonqualified 
intermediary did not comply with the alternative procedures of this 
paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(D) and steps that the nonqualified intermediary has 
taken, or will take, to ensure that no failures occur in the future. If 
the Assistant Commissioner (International) determines that the 
alternative procedures of this paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(D) may apply, a 
determination to that effect will be issued by the IRS to the 
nonqualified intermediary.
    (6) Form 1042-S reporting in case of allocation failure. If a 
nonqualified intermediary fails to provide allocation information by 
February 14 following the year of payment for a withholding rate pool, 
the withholding agent must file Forms 1042-S for payments made to each 
payee in that pool (other than U.S. exempt recipients) in the prior 
calendar year by pro rating the payment to each payee (including U.S. 
exempt recipients) listed in the withholding statement for that 
withholding rate pool. If the nonqualified intermediary fails to 
allocate10 percent or less of an amount required to be allocated for a 
withholding rate pool, a withholding agent shall report the unallocated 
amount as paid to a single unknown payee in accordance with the 
presumption rules of paragraph (b) of this section and Sec. Sec. 
1.1441-5(d) and (e)(6) and 1.6049-5(d). The portion of the payment that 
can be allocated to specific recipients, as defined in Sec. 1.1461-
1(c)(1)(ii), shall be reported to each recipient in accordance with the 
rules of Sec. 1.1461-1(c).
    (7) Liability for tax, interest, and penalties. If a nonqualified 
intermediary fails to provide allocation information by February 14 
following the year of payment for all or a portion of the payments made 
to any withholding rate

[[Page 95]]

pool, the withholding agent from whom the nonqualified intermediary 
received payments of reportable amounts shall not be liable for any tax, 
interest, or penalties, due solely to the errors or omissions of the 
nonqualified intermediary. See Sec. 1.1441-7(b)(2) through (10) for the 
due diligence requirements of a withholding agent. Because failure by 
the nonqualified intermediary to provide allocation information results 
in a payment not being reliably associated with valid documentation, the 
beneficial owners for whom the nonqualified intermediary acts are not 
entitled to a reduced rate of withholding. Therefore, the nonqualified 
intermediary, as a withholding agent, shall be liable for any tax not 
withheld by the withholding agent in accordance with the presumption 
rules, interest on the under withheld tax if the nonqualified 
intermediary fails to pay the tax timely, and any applicable penalties, 
including the penalties under sections 6656 (failure to deposit), 6721 
(failure to file information returns) and 6722 (failure to file payee 
statements). Failure to provide allocation information for more than 10 
percent of the payments made to a particular withholding rate pool will 
be presumed to be an intentional failure within the meaning of sections 
6721(e) and 6722(c). The nonqualified intermediary may rebut the 
presumption.
    (8) Applicability to flow-through entities and certain U.S. 
branches. See paragraph (e)(3)(v) of this section and Sec. 1.1441-
5(c)(3)(iv) and (e)(5)(iv) for the applicability of this paragraph 
(e)(3)(iv) to U.S. branches described in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this 
section (other than U.S. branches treated as U.S. persons) and flow-
through entities.
    (E) Notice procedures. The IRS may notify a withholding agent that 
the alternative procedures of paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(D) of this section 
are not applicable to a specified nonqualified intermediary, a U.S. 
branch described in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section, or a flow-
through entity. If a withholding agent receives such a notice, it must 
commence withholding in accordance with the presumption rules of 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section and Sec. Sec. 1.1441-5(d) and (e)(6) 
and 1.6049-5(d) unless the nonqualified intermediary, U.S. branch, or 
flow-through entity complies with the procedures in paragraphs 
(e)(3)(iv)(A) through (C) of this section. In addition, the IRS may 
notify a withholding agent, in appropriate circumstances, that it must 
apply the presumption rules of paragraph (b)(3) of this section and 
Sec. Sec. 1.1441-5(d) and (e)(6) and 1.6049-5(d) to payments made to a 
nonqualified intermediary, a U.S. branch, or a flow-through entity even 
if the nonqualified intermediary, U.S. branch or flow-through entity 
provides allocation information prior to the payment. A withholding 
agent that receives a notice under this paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(E) must 
commence withholding in accordance with the presumption rules within 30 
days of the date of the notice. The IRS may withdraw its prohibition 
against using the alternative procedures of paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(D) of 
this section, or its requirement to follow the presumption rules, if the 
nonqualified intermediary, U.S. branch, or flow-through entity can 
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Assistant Commissioner 
(International) or his delegate that it is capable of complying with the 
rules under chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code and any other 
conditions required by the Assistant Commissioner (International).
    (v) Withholding certificate from certain U.S. branches. A U.S. 
branch certificate is a withholding certificate provided by a U.S. 
branch described in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section that is not the 
beneficial owner of the income. The withholding certificate is provided 
with respect to reportable amounts and must state that such amounts are 
not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the 
United States. The withholding certificate must either transmit the 
appropriate documentation for the persons for whom the branch receives 
the payment (i.e., as an intermediary) or be provided as evidence of its 
agreement with the withholding agent to be treated as a U.S. person with 
respect to any payment associated with the certificate. A U.S. branch 
withholding certificate is valid only if it is furnished on a Form W-8, 
an acceptable substitute form, or such other form as the IRS may 
prescribe, it is signed under penalties of

[[Page 96]]

perjury by a person authorized to sign for the branch, its validity has 
not expired, and it contains the information, statements, and 
certifications described in this paragraph (e)(3)(v). If the certificate 
is furnished to transmit withholding certificates and other 
documentation, it must contain the information, certifications, and 
statements described in paragraphs (e)(3)(v)(A) through (C) of this 
section and in paragraphs (e)(3)(iii) and (iv) (alternative procedures) 
of this section, applying the term U.S. branch instead of the term 
nonqualified intermediary. If the certificate is furnished pursuant to 
an agreement to treat the U.S. branch as a U.S. person, the information 
and certifications required on the withholding certificate are limited 
to the following--
    (A) The name of the person of which the branch is a part and the 
address of the branch in the United States;
    (B) A certification that the payments associated with the 
certificate are not effectively connected with the conduct of its trade 
or business in the United States; and
    (C) Any other information, certifications, or statements as may be 
required by the form or accompanying instructions in addition to, or in 
lieu of, the information and certification described in this paragraph 
(e)(3)(v).
    (vi) Reportable amounts. For purposes of chapter 3 of the Internal 
Revenue Code, a nonqualified intermediary, qualified intermediary, flow-
through entity, and U.S. branch described in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of 
this section (other than a U.S. branch that agrees to be treated as a 
U.S. person) must provide a withholding certificate and associated 
documentation and other information with respect to reportable amounts. 
For purposes of the regulations under chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue 
Code, the term reportable amount means an amount subject to withholding 
within the meaning of Sec. 1.1441-2(a), bank deposit interest 
(including original issue discount) and similar types of deposit 
interest described in section 871(i)(2)(A) or 881(d) that are from 
sources within the United States, and any amount of interest or original 
issue discount from sources within the United States on the redemption 
of certain short-term obligations described in section 871(g)(1)(B) or 
881(e). Reportable amounts shall not include amounts received on the 
sale or exchange (other than a redemption) of an obligation described in 
section 871(g)(1)(B) or 881(e) that is effected at an office outside the 
United States. See Sec. 1.6045-1(g)(3) to determine whether a sale is 
effected at an office outside the United States. Reportable amounts also 
do not include payments with respect to deposits with banks and other 
financial institutions that remain on deposit for a period of two weeks 
or less, to amounts of original issue discount arising from a sale and 
repurchase transaction that is completed within a period of two weeks or 
less, or to amounts described in Sec. 1.6049-5(b)(7), (10) or (11) 
(relating to certain obligations issued in bearer form). While short-
term OID and bank deposit interest are not subject to withholding under 
chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code, such amounts may be subject to 
information reporting under section 6049 if paid to a U.S. person who is 
not an exempt recipient described in Sec. 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii) and to 
backup withholding under section 3406 in the absence of documentation. 
See Sec. 1.6049-5(d)(3)(iii) for applicable procedures when such 
amounts are paid to a foreign intermediary.
    (4) Applicable rules. The provisions in this paragraph (e)(4) 
describe procedures applicable to withholding certificates on Form W-8 
or Form 8233 (or a substitute form) or documentary evidence furnished to 
establish foreign status. These provisions do not apply to Forms W-9 (or 
their substitutes). For corresponding provisions regrading Form W-9 (or 
a substitute form), see section 3406 and the regulations under that 
section.
    (i) Who may sign the certificate. A withholding certificate (or 
other acceptable substitute) may be signed by any person authorized to 
sign a declaration under penalties of perjury on behalf of the person 
whose name is on the certificate as provided in section 6061 and the 
regulations under that section (relating to who may sign generally for 
an individual, estate, or trust, which includes certain agents

[[Page 97]]

who may sign returns and other documents), section 6062 and the 
regulations under that section (relating to who may sign corporate 
returns), and section 6063 and the regulations under that section 
(relating to who may sign partnership returns).
    (ii) Period of validity--(A) Three-year period. A withholding 
certificate described in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, or a 
certificate described in Sec. 1.871-14(c)(2)(v) (furnished to qualify 
interest as portfolio interest for purposes of sections 871(h) and 
881(c)), shall remain valid until the earlier of the last day of the 
third calendar year following the year in which the withholding 
certificate is signed or the day that a change in circumstances occurs 
that makes any information on the certificate incorrect. For example, a 
withholding certificate signed on September 30, 2001, remains valid 
through December 31, 2004, unless circumstances change that make the 
information on the form no longer correct. Documentary evidence 
described in Sec. Sec. 1.1441-6(c)(3) or (4) or 1.6049-5(c)(1) shall 
remain valid until the earlier of the last day of the third calendar 
year following the year in which the documentary evidence is provided to 
the withholding agent or the day that a change in circumstances occurs 
that makes any information on the documentary evidence incorrect.
    (B) Indefinite validity period. Notwithstanding paragraph 
(e)(4)(ii)(A) of this section, the following certificates or parts of 
certificates shall remain valid until the status of the person whose 
name is on the certificate is changed in a way relevant to the 
certificate or circumstances change that make the information on the 
certificate no longer correct:
    (1) A withholding certificate described in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of 
this section that is furnished with a TIN, provided that the withholding 
agent reports at least one payment annually to the beneficial owner 
under Sec. 1.1461-1(c) or the TIN furnished on the certificate is 
reported to the IRS under the procedures described in Sec. 1.1461-1(d). 
For example, assume a withholding agent receives a Form W-8 in 2001 from 
a beneficial owner with respect to an account that contains bonds, the 
interest on which must be reported on Form 1042-S under Sec. 1.1461-
1(c). The Form W-8 contains a valid TIN and the withholding agent 
reports on Forms 1042-S interest to the beneficial owner for 2001 
through 2005. In 2005, the beneficial owner sells some of the bonds. For 
purposes of the exemption from Form 1099 reporting under Sec. 1.6045-
1(g), the withholding agent may consider the Form W-8 as valid, even 
though the payment of the sales proceeds is not reportable on Form 1042-
S under Sec. 1.1461-1(c) and even though the Form W-8 was provided more 
than three years previously.
    (2) A certificate described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section 
(a qualified intermediary withholding certificate) but not including the 
withholding certificates, documentary evidence, statements or other 
information associated with the certificate.
    (3) A certificate described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section 
(a nonqualified intermediary certificate), but not including the 
withholding certificates, documentary evidence, statements or other 
information associated with the certificate.
    (4) A certificate described in paragraph (e)(3)(v) of this section 
(a U.S. branch withholding certificate), but not including the 
withholding certificates, documentary evidence, statements or other 
information associated with the certificate.
    (5) A certificate described in Sec. 1.1441-5(c)(2)(iv) (dealing 
with a certificate from a person representing to be a withholding 
foreign partnership).
    (6) A certificate described in Sec. 1.1441-5(c)(3)(iii) (a 
withholding certificate from a nonwithholding foreign partnership) but 
not including the withholding certificates, documentary evidence, 
statements or other information required to be associated with the 
certificate.
    (7) A certificate furnished by a person representing to be an 
integral part of a foreign government (within the meaning of Sec. 
1.892-2T(a)(2)) in accordance with Sec. 1.1441-8(b), or by a person 
representing to be a foreign central bank of issue (within the meaning 
of Sec. 1.861-2(b)(4)) or the Bank for International Settlements in 
accordance with Sec. 1.1441-8(c)(1).

[[Page 98]]

    (8) A withholding certificate described in Sec. 1.1441-5(e)(5)(iii) 
provided by a foreign simple trust or a foreign grantor trust to 
transmit documentation of beneficiaries or owners, but not including the 
withholding certificates, documentary evidence, statements or other 
information associated with the certificate.
    (C) Withholding certificate for effectively connected income. 
Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(B)(1) of this section, the period 
of validity of a withholding certificate furnished to a withholding 
agent to claim a reduced rate of withholding for income that is 
effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the 
United States shall be limited to the three-year period described in 
paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(A) of this section.
    (D) Change in circumstances. If a change in circumstances makes any 
information on a certificate or other documentation incorrect, then the 
person whose name is on the certificate or other documentation must 
inform the withholding agent within 30 days of the change and furnish a 
new certificate or new documentation. A certificate or documentation 
becomes invalid from the date that the withholding agent holding the 
certificate or documentation knows or has reason to know that 
circumstances affecting the correctness of the certificate or 
documentation have changed. However, a withholding agent may choose to 
apply the provisions of paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section regarding 
the 90-day grace period as of that date while awaiting a new certificate 
or documentation or while seeking information regarding changes, or 
suspected changes, in the person's circumstances. If an intermediary 
(including a U.S. branch described in paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) of this 
section that passes through certificates to a withholding agent) or a 
flow-through entity becomes aware that a certificate or other 
appropriate documentation it has furnished to the person from whom it 
collects the payment is no longer valid because of a change in the 
circumstances of the person who issued the certificate or furnished the 
other appropriate documentation, then the intermediary or flow-through 
entity must notify the person from whom it collects the payment of the 
change of circumstances. It must also obtain a new withholding 
certificate or new appropriate documentation to replace the existing 
certificate or documentation whose validity has expired due to the 
change in circumstances. If a beneficial owner withholding certificate 
is used to claim foreign status only (and not, also, residence in a 
particular foreign country for purposes of an income tax treaty), a 
change of address is a change in circumstances for purposes of this 
paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(D) only if it changes to an address in the United 
States. Further, a change of address within the same foreign country is 
not a change in circumstances for purposes of this paragraph 
(e)(4)(ii)(D). A change in the circumstances affecting the withholding 
information provided to the withholding agent in accordance with the 
provisions in paragraph (e) (3)(iv) or (5)(v) of this section or in 
Sec. 1.1441-5(c)(3)(iv) shall terminate the validity of the withholding 
certificate with respect to the information that is no longer reliable 
unless the information is updated. A withholding agent may rely on a 
certificate without having to inquire into possible changes of 
circumstances that may affect the validity of the statement, unless it 
knows or has reason to know that circumstances have changed. A 
withholding agent may require a new certificate at any time prior to a 
payment, even though the withholding agent has no actual knowledge or 
reason to know that any information stated on the certificate has 
changed.
    (iii) Retention of withholding certificate. A withholding agent must 
retain each withholding certificate and other documentation for as long 
as it may be relevant to the determination of the withholding agent's 
tax liability under section 1461 and Sec. 1.1461-1.
    (iv) Electronic transmission of information--(A) In general. A 
withholding agent may establish a system for a beneficial owner or payee 
to electronically furnish a Form W-8, an acceptable substitute Form W-8, 
or such other form as the Internal Revenue Service may prescribe. The 
system must meet the requirements described

[[Page 99]]

in paragraph (e)(4)(iv)(B) of this section. A withholding agent may 
accept Forms W-8 that are furnished electronically on or after January 
1, 2000, provided the requirements of paragraph (e)(4)(iv)(B) of this 
section are met.
    (B) Requirements--(1) In general. The electronic system must ensure 
that the information received is the information sent, and must document 
all occasions of user access that result in the submission renewal, or 
modification of a Form W-8. In addition, the design and operation of the 
electronic system, including access procedures, must make it reasonably 
certain that the person accessing the system and furnishing Form W-8 is 
the person named in the Form.
    (2) Same information as paper Form W-8. The electronic transmission 
must provide the withholding agent or payor with exactly the same 
information as the paper Form W-8.
    (3) Perjury statement and signature requirements. The electronic 
transmission must contain an electronic signature by the person whose 
name is on the Form W-8 and the signature must be under penalties of 
perjury in the manner described in this paragraph (e)(4)(iv)(B)(3).
    (i) Perjury statement. The perjury statement must contain the 
language that appears on the paper Form W-8. The electronic system must 
inform the person whose name is on the Form W-8 that the person must 
make the declaration contained in the perjury statement and that the 
declaration is made by signing the Form W-8. The instructions and the 
language of the perjury statement must immediately follow the person's 
certifying statements and immediately precede the person's electronic 
signature.
    (ii) Electronic signature. The act of the electronic signature must 
be effected by the person whose name is on the electronic Form W-8. The 
signature must also authenticate and verify the submission. For this 
purpose, the terms authenticate and verify have the same meanings as 
they do when applied to a written signature on a paper Form W-8. An 
electronic signature can be in any form that satisfies the foregoing 
requirements. The electronic signature must be the final entry in the 
person's Form W-8 submission.
    (4) Requests for electronic Form W-8 data. Upon request by the 
Internal Revenue Service during an examination, the withholding agent 
must supply a hard copy of the electronic Form W-8 and a statement that, 
to the best of the withholding agent's knowledge, the electronic Form W-
8 was filed by the person whose name is on the form. The hard copy of 
the electronic Form W-8 must provide exactly the same information as, 
but need not be identical to, the paper Form W-8.
    (C) Special requirements for transmission of Forms W-8 by an 
intermediary. [Reserved]
    (v) Electronic confirmation of taxpayer identifying number on 
withholding certificate. The Commissioner may prescribe procedures in a 
revenue procedure (see Sec. 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter) or other 
appropriate guidance to require a withholding agent to confirm 
electronically with the IRS information concerning any TIN stated on a 
withholding certificate.
    (vi) Acceptable substitute form. A withholding agent may substitute 
its own form instead of an official Form W-8 or 8233 (or such other 
official form as the IRS may prescribe). Such a substitute for an 
official form will be acceptable if it contains provisions that are 
substantially similar to those of the official form, it contains the 
same certifications relevant to the transactions as are contained on the 
official form and these certifications are clearly set forth, and the 
substitute form includes a signature-under-penalties-of-perjury 
statement identical to the one stated on the official form. The 
substitute form is acceptable even if it does not contain all of the 
provisions contained on the official form, so long as it contains those 
provisions that are relevant to the transaction for which it is 
furnished. For example, a withholding agent that pays no income for 
which treaty benefits are claimed may develop a substitute form that is 
identical to the official form, except that it does not include 
information regarding claim of benefits under an income tax treaty. A 
withholding agent who uses a substitute form must furnish instructions 
relevant to the substitute form

[[Page 100]]

only to the extent and in the manner specified in the instructions to 
the official form. A withholding agent may refuse to accept a 
certificate from a payee or beneficial owner (including the official 
Form W-8 or 8233) if the certificate is not provided on the acceptable 
substitute form provided by the withholding agent. However, a 
withholding agent may refuse to accept a certificate provided by a payee 
or beneficial owner only if the withholding agent furnishes the payee or 
beneficial owner with an acceptable substitute form immediately upon 
receipt of an unacceptable form or within 5 business days of receipt of 
an unacceptable form from the payee or beneficial owner. In that case, 
the substitute form is acceptable only if it contains a notice that the 
withholding agent has refused to accept the form submitted by the payee 
or beneficial owner and that the payee or beneficial owner must submit 
the acceptable form provided by the withholding agent in order for the 
payee or beneficial owner to be treated as having furnished the required 
withholding certificate.
    (vii) Requirement of taxpayer identifying number. A TIN must be 
stated on a withholding certificate when required by this paragraph 
(e)(4)(vii). A TIN is required to be stated on--
    (A) A withholding certificate on which a beneficial owner is 
claiming the benefit of a reduced rate under an income tax treaty (other 
than for amounts described in Sec. 1.1441-6(c)(2);
    (B) A withholding certificate on which a beneficial owner is 
claiming exemption from withholding because income is effectively 
connected with a U.S. trade or business;
    (C) A withholding certificate on which a beneficial owner is 
claiming exemption from withholding under section 871(f) for certain 
annuities received under qualified plans;
    (D) A withholding certificate on which a beneficial owner is 
claiming an exemption based solely on a foreign organization's claim of 
tax exempt status under section 501(c) or private foundation status 
(however, a TIN is not required from a foreign private foundation that 
is subject to the 4-percent tax under section 4948(a) on income if that 
income would be exempt from withholding but for section 4948(a) (e.g., 
portfolio interest));
    (E) A withholding certificate from a person representing to be a 
qualified intermediary described in paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of this 
section;
    (F) A withholding certificate from a person representing to be a 
withholding foreign partnership described in Sec. 1.1441-5(c)(2)(i));
    (G) A withholding certificate from a person representing to be a 
foreign grantor trust with 5 or fewer grantors;
    (H) A withholding certificate provided by a foreign organization 
that is described in section 501(c);
    (I) A withholding certificate from a person representing to be a 
U.S. branch described in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section.
    (viii) Reliance rules. A withholding agent may rely on the 
information and certifications stated on withholding certificates or 
other documentation without having to inquire into the truthfulness of 
this information or certification, unless it has actual knowledge or 
reason to know that the same is untrue. In the case of amounts described 
in Sec. 1.1441-6(c)(2), a withholding agent described in Sec. 1.1441-
7(b)(2)(ii) has reason to know that the information or certifications on 
a certificate are untrue only to the extent provided in Sec. 1.1441-
7(b)(2)(ii). See Sec. 1.1441-6(b)(1) for reliance on representations 
regarding eligibility for a reduced rate under an income tax treaty. 
Paragraphs (e)(4)(viii) (A) and (B) of this section provide examples of 
such reliance.
    (A) Classification. A withholding agent may rely on the claim of 
entity classification indicated on the withholding certificate that it 
receives from or for the beneficial owner, unless it has actual 
knowledge or reason to know that the classification claimed is 
incorrect. A withholding agent may not rely on a person's claim of 
classification other than as a corporation if the name of the 
corporation indicates that the person is a per se corporation described 
in Sec. 301.7701-2(b)(8)(i) of this chapter unless the certificate 
contains a statement that the person is a grandfathered per se 
corporation described in Sec. 301.7701-2(b)(8) of this chapter and that 
its grandfathered status has not

[[Page 101]]

been terminated. In the absence of reliable representation or 
information regarding the classification of the payee or beneficial 
owner, see Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(ii) for applicable presumptions.
    (B) Status of payee as an intermediary or as a person acting for its 
own account. A withholding agent may rely on the type of certificate 
furnished as indicative of the payee's status as an intermediary or as 
an owner, unless the withholding agent has actual knowledge or reason to 
know otherwise. For example, a withholding agent that receives a 
beneficial owner withholding certificate from a foreign financial 
institution may treat the institution as the beneficial owner, unless it 
has information in its records that would indicate otherwise or the 
certificate contains information that is not consistent with beneficial 
owner status (e.g., sub-account numbers or names). If the financial 
institution also acts as an intermediary, the withholding agent may 
request that the institution furnish two certificates, i.e., a 
beneficial owner certificate described in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this 
section for the amounts that it receives as a beneficial owner, and an 
intermediary withholding certificate described in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of 
this section for the amounts that it receives as an intermediary. In the 
absence of reliable representation or information regarding the status 
of the payee as an owner or as an intermediary, see paragraph 
(b)(3)(v)(A) for applicable presumptions.
    (ix) Certificates to be furnished for each account unless exception 
applies. Unless otherwise provided in this paragraph (e)(4)(ix), a 
withholding agent that is a financial institution with which a customer 
may open an account shall obtain withholding certificates or other 
appropriate documentation on an account-by-account basis.
    (A) Coordinated account information system in effect. A withholding 
agent may rely on the withholding certificate or other appropriate 
documentation furnished by a customer for a pre-existing account under 
any one or more of the circumstances described in this paragraph 
(e)(4)(ix)(A).
    (1) A withholding agent may rely on documentation furnished by a 
customer for another account if all such accounts are held at the same 
branch location.
    (2) A withholding agent may rely on documentation furnished by a 
customer for an account held at another branch location of the same 
withholding agent or at a branch location of a person related to the 
withholding agent if the withholding agent and the related person are 
part of a universal account system that uses a customer identifier that 
can be used to retrieve systematically all other accounts of the 
customer. See Sec. 31.3406(c)(3)(ii) and (iii)(C) of this chapter for 
an identical procedure for purposes of backup withholding. For purposes 
of this paragraph (e)(4)(ix)(A), a withholding agent is related to 
another person if it is related within the meaning of section 267(b) or 
707(b).
    (3) A withholding agent may rely on documentation furnished by a 
customer for an account held at another branch location of the same 
withholding agent or at a branch location of a person related to the 
withholding agent if the withholding agent and the related person are 
part of an information system other than a universal account system and 
the information system is described in this paragraph (e)(4)(ix)(A)(3). 
The system must allow the withholding agent to easily access data 
regarding the nature of the documentation, the information contained in 
the documentation, and its validity status, and must allow the 
withholding agent to easily transmit data into the system regarding any 
facts of which it becomes aware that may affect the reliability of the 
documentation. The withholding agent must be able to establish how and 
when it has accessed the data regarding the documentation and, if 
applicable, how and when it has transmitted data regarding any facts of 
which it became aware that may affect the reliability of the 
documentation. In addition, the withholding agent or the related party 
must be able to establish that any data it has transmitted to the 
information system has been processed and appropriate due diligence has 
been exercised regarding the validity of the documentation.

[[Page 102]]

    (4) A withholding agent may rely on documentation furnished by a 
beneficial owner or payee to an agent of the withholding agent. The 
agent may retain the documentation as part of an information system 
maintained for a single or multiple withholding agents provided that the 
system permits any withholding agent that uses the system to easily 
access data regarding the nature of the documentation, the information 
contained in the documentation, and its validity, and must allow the 
withholding agent to easily transmit data into the system regarding any 
facts of which it becomes aware that may affect the reliability of the 
documentation. The withholding agent must be able to establish how and 
when it has accessed the data regarding the documentation and, if 
applicable, how and when it has transmitted data regarding any facts of 
which it became aware that may affect the reliability of the 
documentation. In addition, the withholding agent must be able to 
establish that any data it has transmitted to the information system has 
been processed and appropriate due diligence has been exercised 
regarding the validity of the documentation.
    (B) Family of mutual funds. An interest in a mutual fund that has a 
common investment advisor or common principal underwriter with other 
mutual funds (within the same family of funds) may, in the discretion of 
the mutual fund, be represented by one single withholding certificate 
where shares are acquired or owned in any of the funds. See Sec. 
31.3406(h)-3(a)(2) of this chapter for an identical procedures for 
purposes of backup withholding.
    (C) Special rule for brokers--(1) In general. A withholding agent 
may rely on the certification of a broker that the broker holds a valid 
beneficial owner withholding certificate described in paragraph 
(e)(2)(i) of this section or other appropriate documentation for that 
beneficial owner with respect to any readily tradable instrument, as 
defined in Sec. 31.3406(h)-1(d) of this chapter, if the broker is a 
United States person (including a U.S. branch treated as a U.S. person 
under paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section) that is acting as the agent 
of a beneficial owner and the U.S. broker has been provided a valid Form 
W-8 or other appropriate documentation. The certification must be in 
writing or in electronic form and contain all of the information 
required of a nonqualified intermediary under paragraphs (e)(3)(iv)(B) 
and (C) of this section. If a U.S. broker chooses to use this paragraph 
(e)(4)(ix)(C), that U.S. broker will be solely responsible for applying 
the rules of Sec. 1.1441-7(b) to the withholding certificates or other 
appropriate documentation. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(4)(ix)(C), 
the term broker means a person treated as a broker under Sec. 1.6045-
1(a).
    (2) The following example illustrates the rules of this paragraph 
(e)(4)(ix)(C):

    Example. SCO is a U.S. securities clearing organization that 
provides clearing services for correspondent broker, CB, a U.S. 
corporation. Pursuant to a fully disclosed clearing agreement, CB fully 
discloses the identity of each of its customers to SCO. Part of SCO's 
clearing duties include the crediting of income and gross proceeds of 
readily tradeable instruments (as defined in Sec. 31.3406(h)-1(d)) to 
each customer's account. For each disclosed customer that is a foreign 
beneficial owner, CB provides SCO with information required under 
paragraphs (e)(3)(iv)(B) and (C) of this section that is necessary to 
apply the correct rate of withholding and to file Forms 1042-S. SCO may 
use the representations and beneficial owner information provided by CB 
to determine the proper amount of withholding and to file Forms 1042-S. 
CB is responsible for determining the validity of the withholding 
certificates or other appropriate documentation under Sec. 1.1441-1(b).

    (5) Qualified intermediaries--(i) General rule. A qualified 
intermediary, as defined in paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of this section, may 
furnish a qualified intermediary withholding certificate to a 
withholding agent. The withholding certificate provides certifications 
on behalf of other persons for the purpose of claiming and verifying 
reduced rates of withholding under section 1441 or 1442 and for the 
purpose of reporting and withholding under other provisions of the 
Internal Revenue Code, such as the provisions under chapter 61 and 
section 3406 (and the regulations under those provisions). Furnishing 
such a certificate is in lieu of transmitting to a withholding agent 
withholding certificates or other appropriate documentation for the 
persons for whom the qualified intermediary receives the payment, 
including interest holders in

[[Page 103]]

a qualified intermediary that is fiscally transparent under the 
regulations under section 894. Although the qualified intermediary is 
required to obtain withholding certificates or other appropriate 
documentation from beneficial owners, payees, or interest holders 
pursuant to its agreement with the IRS, it is generally not required to 
attach such documentation to the intermediary withholding certificate. 
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence a qualified intermediary must 
provide a withholding agent with the Forms W-9, or disclose the names, 
addresses, and taxpayer identifying numbers, if known, of those U.S. 
non-exempt recipients for whom the qualified intermediary receives 
reportable amounts (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(3)(vi) of this 
section) to the extent required in the qualified intermediary's 
agreement with the IRS. A person may claim qualified intermediary status 
before an agreement is executed with the IRS if it has applied for such 
status and the IRS authorizes such status on an interim basis under such 
procedures as the IRS may prescribe.
    (ii) Definition of qualified intermediary. With respect to a payment 
to a foreign person, the term qualified intermediary means a person that 
is a party to a withholding agreement with the IRS and such person is--
    (A) A foreign financial institution or a foreign clearing 
organization (as defined in Sec. 1.163-5(c)(2)(i)(D)(8), without regard 
to the requirement that the organization hold obligations for members), 
other than a U.S. branch or U.S. office of such institution or 
organization;
    (B) A foreign branch or office of a U.S. financial institution or a 
foreign branch or office of a U.S. clearing organization (as defined in 
Sec. 1.163-5(c)(2)(i)(D)(8), without regard to the requirement that the 
organization hold obligations for members);
    (C) A foreign corporation for purposes of presenting claims of 
benefits under an income tax treaty on behalf of its shareholders; or
    (D) Any other person acceptable to the IRS.
    (iii) Withholding agreement--(A) In general. The IRS may, upon 
request, enter into a withholding agreement with a foreign person 
described in paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of this section pursuant to such 
procedures as the IRS may prescribe in published guidance (see Sec. 
601.601(d)(2) of this chapter). Under the withholding agreement, a 
qualified intermediary shall generally be subject to the applicable 
withholding and reporting provisions applicable to withholding agents 
and payors under chapters 3 and 61 of the Internal Revenue Code, section 
3406, the regulations under those provisions, and other withholding 
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, except to the extent provided 
under the agreement.
    (B) Terms of the withholding agreement. Generally, the agreement 
shall specify the type of certifications and documentation upon which 
the qualified intermediary may rely to ascertain the classification 
(e.g., corporation or partnership) and status (i.e., U.S. or foreign) of 
beneficial owners and payees who receive payments collected by the 
qualified intermediary and, if necessary, entitlement to the benefits of 
a reduced rate under an income tax treaty. The agreement shall specify 
if, and to what extent, the qualified intermediary may assume primary 
withholding responsibility in accordance with paragraph (e)(5)(iv) of 
this section. It shall also specify the extent to which applicable 
return filing and information reporting requirements are modified so 
that, in appropriate cases, the qualified intermediary may report 
payments to the IRS on an aggregated basis, without having to disclose 
the identity of beneficial owners and payees. However, the qualified 
intermediary may be required to provide to the IRS the name and address 
of those foreign customers who benefit from a reduced rate under an 
income tax treaty pursuant to the qualified intermediary arrangement for 
purposes of verifying entitlement to such benefits, particularly under 
an applicable limitation on benefits provision. Under the agreement, a 
qualified intermediary may agree to act as an acceptance agent to 
perform the duties described in Sec. 301.6109-1(d)(3)(iv)(A) of this 
chapter. The agreement may specify

[[Page 104]]

the manner in which applicable procedures for adjustments for 
underwithholding and overwithholding, including refund procedures, apply 
in the context of a qualified intermediary arrangement and the extent to 
which applicable procedures may be modified. In particular, a 
withholding agreement may allow a qualified intermediary to claim 
refunds of overwithheld amounts. If relevant, the agreement shall 
specify the manner in which the qualified intermediary may deal with 
payments to other intermediaries and flow-through entities. In addition, 
the agreement shall specify the manner in which the IRS will verify 
compliance with the agreement. In appropriate cases, the IRS may agree 
to rely on audits performed by an intermediary's approved auditor. In 
such a case, the IRS's audit may be limited to the audit of the 
auditor's records (including work papers of the auditor and reports 
prepared by the auditor indicating the methodology employed to verify 
the entity's compliance with the agreement). For this purpose, the 
agreement shall specify the auditor or class of auditors that are 
approved. Generally, an auditor will not be approved if the auditor is 
not subject to laws, regulations, or rules that impose sanctions for 
failure to exercise its independence and to perform the audit 
competently. The agreement may include provisions for the assessment and 
collection of tax in the event that failure to comply with the terms of 
the agreement results in the failure by the withholding agent or the 
qualified intermediary to withhold and deposit the required amount of 
tax. Further, the agreement may specify the procedures by which deposits 
of amounts withheld are to be deposited, if different from the deposit 
procedures under the Internal Revenue Code and applicable regulations. 
To determine whether to enter a qualified intermediary withholding 
agreement and the terms of any particular withholding agreement, the IRS 
will consider appropriate factors including whether or not the foreign 
person agrees to assume primary withholding responsibility, the type of 
local know-your-customer laws and practices to which it is subject, the 
extent and nature of supervisory and regulatory control exercised under 
the laws of the foreign country over the foreign person, the volume of 
investments in U.S. securities (determined in dollar amounts and number 
of account holders), the financial condition of the foreign person, and 
whether the qualified intermediary is a resident of a country with which 
the United States has an income tax treaty.
    (iv) Assignment of primary withholding responsibility. Any person 
who meets the definition of a withholding agent under Sec. 1.1441-7(a) 
(whether a U.S. person or a foreign person) is required to withhold and 
deposit any amount withheld under Sec. 1.1461-1(a) and to make the 
returns prescribed by Sec. 1.1461-1(b) and (c). If permitted by its 
qualified intermediary agreement, a qualified intermediary agreement 
may, however, inform a withholding agent from which it receives a 
payment that it will assume the primary obligation to withhold, deposit, 
and report amounts under chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code and/or 
under chapter 61 of the Internal Revenue Code and section 3406. If a 
withholding agent makes a payment of an amount subject to withholding, 
as defined in Sec. 1.1441-2(a), or a reportable payment, as defined in 
section 3406(b), to a qualified intermediary that represents to the 
withholding agent that it has assumed primary withholding responsibility 
for the payment, the withholding agent is not required to withhold on 
the payment. The withholding agent is not required to determine that the 
qualified intermediary agreement actually permits the qualified 
intermediary to assume primary withholding responsibility. A qualified 
intermediary that assumes primary withholding responsibility under 
chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code or primary reporting and backup 
withholding responsibility under chapter 61 and section 3406 is not 
required to assume primary withholding responsibility for all accounts 
it has with a withholding agent but must assume primary withholding 
responsibility for all payments made to any one account that it has with 
the withholding agent. A qualified intermediary may agree with the 
withholding agent to assume primary withholding responsibility under 
chapter 3 and section 3406, only

[[Page 105]]

if expressly permitted to do so under its agreement with the IRS.
    (v) Withholding statement--(A) In general. A qualified intermediary 
must provide each withholding agent from which it receives reportable 
amounts, as defined in paragraph (e)(3)(vi) of this section, as a 
qualified intermediary with a written statement (the withholding 
statement) containing the information specified in paragraph 
(e)(5)(v)(B) of this section. A withholding statement is not required, 
however, if all of the information a withholding agent needs to fulfill 
its withholding and reporting requirements is contained in the 
withholding certificate. The qualified intermediary agreement may 
require, in appropriate circumstances, the qualified intermediary to 
include information in its withholding statement relating to payments 
other than payments of reportable amounts. The withholding statement 
forms an integral part of the qualified intermediary's qualified 
intermediary withholding certificate and the penalties of perjury 
statement provided on the withholding certificate shall apply to the 
withholding statement as well. The withholding statement may be provided 
in any manner, and in any form, to which qualified intermediary and the 
withholding agent mutually agree, including electronically. If the 
withholding statement is provided electronically, there must be 
sufficient safeguards to ensure that the information received by the 
withholding agent is the information sent by qualified intermediary and 
must also document all occasions of user access that result in the 
submission or modification of withholding statement information. In 
addition, the electronic system must be capable of providing a hard copy 
of all withholding statements provided by the qualified intermediary. 
The withholding statement shall be updated as often as necessary for the 
withholding agent to meet its reporting and withholding obligations 
under chapters 3 and 61 of the Internal Revenue Code and section 3406. A 
withholding agent will be liable for tax, interest, and penalties in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(7) of this section to the extent it does 
not follow the presumption rules of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, 
Sec. Sec. 1.1441-5(d) and (e)(6), and 1.6049-5(d) for any payment, or 
portion thereof, for which it does not have a valid withholding 
statement prior to making a payment.
    (B) Content of withholding statement. The withholding statement must 
contain sufficient information for a withholding agent to apply the 
correct rate of withholding on payments from the accounts identified on 
the statement and to properly report such payments on Forms 1042-S and 
Forms 1099, as applicable. The withholding statement must--
    (1) Designate those accounts for which the qualified intermediary 
acts as a qualified intermediary;
    (2) Designate those accounts for which qualified intermediary 
assumes primary withholding responsibility under chapter 3 of the 
Internal Revenue Code and/or primary reporting and backup withholding 
responsibility under chapter 61 and section 3406; and
    (3) Provide information regarding withholding rate pools, as 
described in paragraph (e)(5)(v)(C) of this section.
    (C) Withholding rate pools--(1) In general. Except to the extent it 
has assumed both primary withholding responsibility under chapter 3 of 
the Internal Revenue Code and primary reporting and backup withholding 
responsibility under chapter 61 and section 3406 with respect to a 
payment, a qualified intermediary shall provide as part of its 
withholding statement the withholding rate pool information that is 
required for the withholding agent to meet its withholding and reporting 
obligations under chapters 3 and 61 of the Internal Revenue Code and 
section 3406. A withholding rate pool is a payment of a single type of 
income, determined in accordance with the categories of income reported 
on Form 1042-S or Form 1099, as applicable, that is subject to a single 
rate of withholding. A withholding rate pool may be established by any 
reasonable method on which the qualified intermediary and a withholding 
agent agree (e.g., by establishing a separate account for a single 
withholding rate pool, or by dividing a payment made to a single account 
into portions allocable to each withholding rate pool). To the extent a

[[Page 106]]

qualified intermediary does not assume primary reporting and backup 
withholding responsibility under chapter 61 and section 3406, a 
qualified intermediary's withholding statement must establish a separate 
withholding rate pool for each U.S. non-exempt recipient account holder 
that the qualified intermediary has disclosed to the withholding agent 
unless the qualified intermediary uses the alternative procedures in 
paragraph (e)(5)(v)(C)(2) of this section. A qualified intermediary 
shall determine withholding rate pools based on valid documentation that 
it obtains under its withholding agreement with the IRS, or if a payment 
cannot be reliably associated with valid documentation, under the 
applicable presumption rules. If a qualified intermediary has an account 
holder that is another intermediary (whether a qualified intermediary or 
a nonqualified intermediary) or a flow-through entity, the qualified 
intermediary may combine the account holder information provided by the 
intermediary or flow-through entity with the qualified intermediary's 
direct account holder information to determine the qualified 
intermediary's withholding rate pools.
    (2) Alternative procedure for U.S. non-exempt recipients. If 
permitted under its agreement with the IRS, a qualified intermediary 
may, by mutual agreement with a withholding agent, establish a single 
zero withholding rate pool that includes U.S. non-exempt recipient 
account holders for whom the qualified intermediary has provided Forms 
W-9 prior to the withholding agent paying any reportable payments, as 
defined in the qualified intermediary agreement, and a separate 
withholding rate pool (subject to 31-percent withholding) that includes 
only U.S. non-exempt recipient account holders for whom a qualified 
intermediary has not provided Forms W-9 prior to the withholding agent 
paying any reportable payments. If a qualified intermediary chooses the 
alternative procedure of this paragraph (e)(5)(v)(C)(2), the qualified 
intermediary must provide the information required by its qualified 
intermediary agreement to the withholding agent no later than January 15 
of the year following the year in which the payments are paid. Failure 
to provide such information will result in the application of penalties 
to the qualified intermediary under sections 6721 and 6722, as well as 
any other applicable penalties, and may result in the termination of the 
qualified intermediary's withholding agreement with the IRS. A 
withholding agent shall not be liable for tax, interest, or penalties 
for failure to backup withhold or report information under chapter 61 of 
the Internal Revenue Code due solely to the errors or omissions of the 
qualified intermediary. If a qualified intermediary fails to provide the 
allocation information required by this paragraph (e)(5)(v)(C)(2), with 
respect to U.S. non-exempt recipients, the withholding agent shall 
report the unallocated amount paid from the withholding rate pool to an 
unknown recipient, or otherwise in accordance with the appropriate Form 
1099 and the instructions accompanying the form.
    (f) Effective date--(1) In general. This section applies to payments 
made after December 31, 2000.
    (2) Transition rules--(i) Special rules for existing documentation. 
For purposes of paragraphs (d)(3) and (e)(2)(i) of this section, the 
validity of a withholding certificate (namely, Form W-8, 8233, 1001, 
4224, or 1078 , or a statement described in Sec. 1.1441-5 in effect 
prior to January 1, 2001 (see Sec. 1.1441-5 as contained in 26 CFR part 
1, revised April 1, 1999)) that was valid on January 1, 1998 under the 
regulations in effect prior to January 1, 2001 (see 26 CFR parts 1 and 
35a, revised April 1, 1999) and expired, or will expire, at any time 
during 1998, is extended until December 31, 1998. The validity of a 
withholding certificate that is valid on or after January 1, 1999, 
remains valid until its validity expires under the regulations in effect 
prior to January 1, 2001 (see 26 CFR parts 1 and 35a, revised April 1, 
1999) but in no event will such withholding certificate remain valid 
after December 31, 2000. The rule in this paragraph (f)(2)(i), however, 
does not apply to extend the validity period of a withholding 
certificate that expires solely by reason of changes in the 
circumstances of the person whose name is on the certificate. 
Notwithstanding

[[Page 107]]

the first three sentences of this paragraph (f)(2)(i), a withholding 
agent may choose to not take advantage of the transition rule in this 
paragraph (f)(2)(i) with respect to one or more withholding certificates 
valid under the regulations in effect prior to January 1, 2001 (see 26 
CFR parts 1 and 35a, revised April 1, 1999) and, therefore, to require 
withholding certificates conforming to the requirements described in 
this section (new withholding certificates). For purposes of this 
section, a new withholding certificate is deemed to satisfy the 
documentation requirement under the regulations in effect prior to 
January 1, 2001 (see 26 CFR parts 1 and 35a, revised April 1, 1999). 
Further, a new withholding certificate remains valid for the period 
specified in paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section, regardless of when 
the certificate is obtained.
    (ii) Lack of documentation for past years. A taxpayer may elect to 
apply the provisions of paragraphs (b)(7)(i)(B), (ii), and (iii) of this 
section, dealing with liability for failure to obtain documentation 
timely, to all of its open tax years, including tax years that are 
currently under examination by the IRS. The election is made by simply 
taking action under those provisions in the same manner as the taxpayer 
would take action for payments made after December 31, 2000.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1441-2  Amounts subject to withholding.

    (a) In general. For purposes of the regulations under chapter 3 of 
the Internal Revenue Code, the term amounts subject to withholding means 
amounts from sources within the United States that constitute either 
fixed or determinable annual or periodical income described in paragraph 
(b) of this section or other amounts subject to withholding described in 
paragraph (c) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (a), an 
amount shall be treated as being from sources within the United States 
if the source of the amount cannot be determined at the time of payment. 
See Sec. 1.1441-3(d)(1) for determining the amount to be withheld from 
a payment in the absence of information at the time of payment regarding 
the source of the amount. Amounts subject to withholding include amounts 
that are not fixed or determinable annual or periodical income and upon 
which withholding is specifically required under a provision of this 
section or another section of the regulations under chapter 3 of the 
Internal Revenue Code (such as corporate distributions upon which 
withholding is required under Sec. 1.1441-3(c)(1) that do not 
constitute dividend income). Amounts subject to withholding do not 
include--
    (1) Amounts described in Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(4)(i) to the extent they 
involve interest on obligations in bearer form or on foreign-targeted 
registered obligations (but, in the case of a foreign-targeted 
registered obligation, only to the extent of those amounts paid to a 
registered owner that is a financial institution within the meaning of 
section 871(h)(5)(B) or a member of a clearing organization which member 
is the beneficial owner of the obligation);
    (2) Amounts described in Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(4)(ii) (dealing with bank 
deposit interest and similar types of interest (including original issue 
discount) described in section 871(i)(2)(A) or 881(d));
    (3) Amounts described in Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(4)(iv) (dealing with 
interest or original issue discount on certain short-term obligations 
described in section 871(g)(1)(B) or 881(e));
    (4) Amounts described in Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(4)(xx) (dealing with 
income from certain gambling winnings exempt from tax under section 
871(j));
    (5) Amounts paid as part of the purchase price of an obligation sold 
or exchanged between interest payment dates, unless the sale or exchange 
is part of a plan the principal purpose of which is to avoid tax and the 
withholding agent has actual knowledge or reason to know of such plan;
    (6) Original issue discount paid as part of the purchase price of an 
obligation sold or exchanged in a transaction other than a redemption of 
such obligation, unless the purchase is part of a plan the principal 
purpose of which is

[[Page 108]]

to avoid tax and the withholding agent has actual knowledge or reason to 
know of such plan; and
    (7) Insurance premiums paid with respect to a contract that is 
subject to the section 4371 excise tax.
    (b) Fixed or determinable annual or periodical income--(1) In 
general--(i) Definition. For purposes of chapter 3 of the Internal 
Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder, fixed or determinable 
annual or periodical income includes all income included in gross income 
under section 61 (including original issue discount) except for the 
items specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Items of income 
that are excluded from gross income under a provision of law without 
regard to the U.S. or foreign status of the owner of the income, such as 
interest excluded from gross income under section 103(a) or qualified 
scholarship income under section 117, shall not be treated as fixed or 
determinable annual or periodical income under chapter 3 of the Internal 
Revenue Code. Income excluded from gross income under section 892 
(income of foreign governments) or section 115 (income of a U.S. 
possession) is fixed or determinable annual or periodical income since 
the exclusion from gross income under those sections is dependent on the 
foreign status of the owner of the income. See Sec. 1.306-3(h) for 
treating income from the disposition of section 306 stock as fixed or 
determinable annual or periodical income.
    (ii) Manner of payment. The term fixed or determinable annual or 
periodical is merely descriptive of the character of a class of income. 
If an item of income falls within the class of income contemplated in 
the statute and described in paragraph (a) of this section, it is 
immaterial whether payment of that item is made in a series of payments 
or in a single lump sum. Further, the income need not be paid annually 
if it is paid periodically; that is to say, from time to time, whether 
or not at regular intervals. The fact that a payment is not made 
annually or periodically does not, however, prevent it from being fixed 
or determinable annual or periodical income (e.g., a lump sum payment). 
In addition, the fact that the length of time during which the payments 
are to be made may be increased or diminished in accordance with 
someone's will or with the happening of an event does not disqualify the 
payment as determinable or periodical. For this purpose, the share of 
the fixed or determinable annual or periodical income of an estate or 
trust from sources within the United States which is required to be 
distributed currently, or which has been paid or credited during the 
taxable year, to a nonresident alien beneficiary of such estate or trust 
constitutes fixed or determinable annual or periodical income.
    (iii) Determinability of amount. An item of income is fixed when it 
is to be paid in amounts definitely pre-determined. An item of income is 
determinable if the amount to be paid is not known but there is a basis 
of calculation by which the amount may be ascertained at a later time. 
For example, interest is determinable even if it is contingent in that 
its amount cannot be determined at the time of payment of an amount with 
respect to a loan because the calculation of the interest portion of the 
payment is contingent upon factors that are not fixed at the time of the 
payment. For purposes of this section, an amount of income does not have 
to be determined at the time that the payment is made in order to be 
determinable. An amount of income described in paragraph (a) of this 
section which the withholding agent knows is part of a payment it makes 
but which it cannot calculate exactly at the time of payment, is 
nevertheless determinable if the determination of the exact amount 
depends upon events expected to occur at a future date. In contrast, a 
payment which may be income in the future based upon events that are not 
anticipated at the time the payment is made is not determinable. For 
example, loan proceeds may become income to the borrower when and to the 
extent the loan is canceled without repayment. While the cancellation of 
the debt is income to the borrower when it occurs, it is not 
determinable at the time the loan proceeds are disbursed to the borrower 
if the lack of repayment leading to the cancellation of part or all of 
the debt was not anticipated at the time of disbursement. The fact that 
the source

[[Page 109]]

of an item of income cannot be determined at the time that the payment 
is made does not render a payment not determinable. See Sec. 1.1441-
3(d)(1) for determining the amount to be withheld from a payment in the 
absence of information at the time of payment regarding the source of 
the amount.
    (2) Exceptions. For purposes of chapter 3 of the Code and the 
regulations thereunder, the items of income described in this paragraph 
(b)(2) are not fixed or determinable annual or periodical income--
    (i) Gains derived from the sale of property (including market 
discount and option premiums), except for gains described in paragraph 
(b)(3) or (c) of this section; and
    (ii) Any other income that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may 
determine, in published guidance (see Sec. 601.601(d)(2) of this 
chapter), is not fixed or determinable annual or periodical income.
    (3) Original issue discount--(i) Amount subject to tax. An amount 
representing original issue discount is fixed or determinable annual or 
periodical income that is subject to tax under sections 871(a)(1)(C) and 
881(a)(3) to the extent provided in those sections and this paragraph 
(b)(3) if not otherwise excluded under paragraph (a) of this section. An 
amount of original issue discount is subject to tax with respect to a 
foreign beneficial owner of an obligation carrying original issue 
discount upon a sale or exchange of the obligation or when a payment is 
made on such obligation. The amount taxable is the amount of original 
issue discount that accrued while the foreign person held the obligation 
up to the time that the obligation is sold or exchanged or that a 
payment is made on the obligation, reduced by any amount of original 
issue discount that was taken into account prior to that time (due to a 
payment made on the obligation). In the case of a payment made on the 
obligation, the tax due on the amount of original issue discount may not 
exceed the amount of the payment reduced by the tax imposed on any 
portion of the payment that is qualified stated interest.
    (ii) Amounts subject to withholding. A withholding agent must 
withhold on the taxable amount of original issue discount paid on the 
redemption of an original issue discount obligation unless an exception 
to withholding applies (e.g., portfolio interest or treaty exception). 
In addition, withholding is required on the taxable amount of original 
issue discount upon the sale or exchange of an original issue discount 
obligation, other than in a redemption, to the extent the withholding 
agent has actual knowledge or reason to know that the sale or exchange 
is part of a plan the principal purpose of which is to avoid tax. If a 
withholding agent cannot determine the taxable amount of original issue 
discount on the redemption of an original issue discount obligation (or 
on the sale or exchange of such an obligation if the principal purpose 
of the sale is to avoid tax), then it must withhold on the entire amount 
of original issue discount accrued from the date of issue until the date 
of redemption (or the date the obligation is sold or exchanged) 
determined on the basis of the most recently published ``List of 
Original Issue Discount Instruments'' (IRS Publication 1212, available 
from the IRS Forms Distribution Center) or similar list published by the 
IRS as if the beneficial owner of the obligation had held the obligation 
since its original issue.
    (iii) Exceptions to withholding. To the extent that this paragraph 
(b)(3) applies to require withholding by a person other than an issuer 
of an original issue discount obligation, or the issuer's agent, it 
shall apply only to obligations issued after December 31, 2000.
    (4) Securities lending transactions and equivalent transactions. See 
Sec. Sec. 1.871-7(b)(2) and 1.881-2(b)(2) regarding the character of 
substitute payments as fixed and determinable annual or periodical 
income. Such amounts constitute income subject to withholding to the 
extent they are from sources within the United States, as determined 
under section Sec. Sec. 1.861-2(a)(7) and 1.861-3(a)(6). See Sec. Sec. 
1.6042-3(a)(2) and 1.6049-5(a)(5) for reporting requirements applicable 
to substitute dividend and interest payments, respectively.
    (c) Other income subject to withholding. Withholding is also 
required on the following items of income--

[[Page 110]]

    (1) Gains described in sections 631 (b) or (c), relating to 
treatment of gain on disposal of timber, coal, or domestic iron ore with 
a retained economic interest; and
    (2) Gains subject to the 30-percent tax under section 871(a)(1)(D) 
or 881(a)(4), relating to contingent payments received from the sale or 
exchange of patents, copyrights, and similar intangible property.
    (d) Exceptions to withholding where no money or property is paid or 
lack of knowledge--(1) General rule. A withholding agent who is not 
related to the recipient or beneficial owner has an obligation to 
withhold under section 1441 only to the extent that, at any time between 
the date that the obligation to withhold would arise (but for the 
provisions of this paragraph (d)) and the due date for the filing of 
return on Form 1042 (including extensions) for the year in which the 
payment occurs, it has control over, or custody of money or property 
owned by the recipient or beneficial owner from which to withhold an 
amount and has knowledge of the facts that give rise to the payment. The 
exemption from the obligation to withhold under this paragraph (d) shall 
not apply, however, to distributions with respect to stock or if the 
lack of control or custody of money or property from which to withhold 
is part of a pre-arranged plan known to the withholding agent to avoid 
withholding under section 1441, 1442, or 1443. For purposes of this 
paragraph (d), a withholding agent is related to the recipient or 
beneficial owner if it is related within the meaning of section 482. Any 
exemption from withholding pursuant to this paragraph (d) applies 
without a requirement that documentation be furnished to the withholding 
agent. However, documentation may have to be furnished for purposes of 
the information reporting provisions under chapter 61 of the Code and 
backup withholding under section 3406. The exemption from withholding 
under this paragraph (d) is not a determination that the amounts are not 
fixed or determinable annual or periodical income, nor does it 
constitute an exemption from reporting the amount under Sec. 1.1461-1 
(b) and (c).
    (2) Cancellation of debt. A lender of funds who forgives any portion 
of the loan is deemed to have made a payment of income to the borrower 
under Sec. 1.61-12 at the time the event of forgiveness occurs. 
However, based on the rules of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the 
lender shall have no obligation to withhold on such amount to the extent 
that it does not have custody or control over money or property of the 
borrower at any time between the time that the loan is forgiven and the 
due date (including extensions) of the Form 1042 for the year in which 
the payment is deemed to occur. A payment received by the lender from 
the borrower in partial settlement of the debt obligation does not, for 
this purpose, constitute an amount of money or property belonging to the 
borrower from which the withholding tax liability can be satisfied.
    (3) Satisfaction of liability following underwithholding by 
withholding agent. A withholding agent who, after failing to withhold 
the proper amount from a payment, satisfies the underwithheld amount out 
of its own funds may cause the beneficial owner to realize income to the 
extent of such satisfaction or may be considered to have advanced funds 
to the beneficial owner. Such determination depends upon the contractual 
arrangements governing the satisfaction of such tax liability (e.g., 
arrangements in which the withholding agent agrees to pay the amount due 
under section 1441 for the beneficial owner) or applicable laws 
governing the transaction. If the satisfaction of the tax liability is 
considered to constitute an advance of funds by the withholding agent to 
the beneficial owner and the withholding agent fails to collect the 
amount from the beneficial owner, a cancellation of indebtedness may 
result, giving rise to income to the beneficial owner under Sec. 1.61-
12. While such income is annual or periodical fixed or determinable, the 
withholding agent shall have no liability to withhold on such income to 
the extent the conditions set forth in paragraphs (d) (1) and (2) of 
this section are satisfied with respect to this income. Contrast the 
rules of this paragraph (d)(3) with the rules in Sec. 1.1441-3(f)(1) 
dealing with a situation in which the

[[Page 111]]

satisfaction of the beneficial owner's tax liability itself constitutes 
additional income to the beneficial owner. See, also, Sec. 1.1441-
3(c)(2)(ii)(B) for a special rule regarding underwithholding on 
corporate distributions due to underestimating an amount of earnings and 
profits.
    (e) Payment--(1) General rule. A payment is considered made to a 
person if that person realizes income whether or not such income results 
from an actual transfer of cash or other property. For example, 
realization of income from cancellation of debt results in a deemed 
payment. A payment is considered made when the amount would be 
includible in the income of the beneficial owner under the U.S. tax 
principles governing the cash basis method of accounting. A payment is 
considered made whether it is made directly to the beneficial owner or 
to another person for the benefit of the beneficial owner (e.g., to the 
agent of the beneficial owner). Thus, a payment of income is considered 
made to a beneficial owner if it is paid in complete or partial 
satisfaction of the beneficial owner's debt to a creditor. In the event 
of a conflict between the rules of this paragraph (e)(1) governing 
whether a payment has occurred and its timing and the rules of Sec. 
31.3406(a)-4 of this chapter, the rules in Sec. 31.3406(a)-4 of this 
chapter shall apply to the extent that the application of section 3406 
is relevant to the transaction at issue.
    (2) Income allocated under section 482. A payment is considered made 
to the extent income subject to withholding is allocated under section 
482. Further, income arising as a result of a secondary adjustment made 
in conjunction with a reallocation of income under section 482 from a 
foreign person to a related U.S. person is considered paid to a foreign 
person unless the taxpayer to whom the income is reallocated has entered 
into a repatriation agreement with the IRS and the agreement eliminates 
the liability for withholding under this section. For purposes of 
determining the liability for withholding, the payment of income is 
deemed to have occurred on the last day of the taxable year in which the 
transactions that give rise to the allocation of income and the 
secondary adjustments, if any, took place.
    (3) Blocked income. Income is not considered paid if it is blocked 
under executive authority, such as the President's exercise of emergency 
power under the Trading with the Enemy Act (50 U.S.C. App. 5), or the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.). 
However, on the date that the blocking restrictions are removed, the 
income that was blocked is considered constructively received by the 
beneficial owner (and therefore paid for purposes of this section) and 
subject to withholding under Sec. 1.1441-1. Any exemption from 
withholding pursuant to this paragraph (e)(3) applies without a 
requirement that documentation be furnished to the withholding agent. 
However, documentation may have to be furnished for purposes of the 
information reporting provisions under chapter 61 of the Code and backup 
withholding under section 3406. The exemption from withholding granted 
by this paragraph (e)(3) is not a determination that the amounts are not 
fixed or determinable annual or periodical income.
    (4) Special rules for dividends. For purposes of sections 1441 and 
6042, in the case of stock for which the record date is earlier than the 
payment date, dividends are considered paid on the payment date. In the 
case of a corporate reorganization, if a beneficial owner is required to 
exchange stock held in a former corporation for stock in a new 
corporation before dividends that are to be paid with respect to the 
stock in the new corporation will be paid on such stock, the dividend is 
considered paid on the date that the payee or beneficial owner actually 
exchanges the stock and receives the dividend. See Sec. 31.3406(a)-
4(a)(2) of this chapter.
    (5) Certain interest accrued by a foreign corporation. For purposes 
of sections 1441 and 6049, a foreign corporation shall be treated as 
having made a payment of interest as of the last day of the taxable year 
if it has made an election under Sec. 1.884-4(c)(1) to treat accrued 
interest as if it were paid in that taxable year.
    (6) Payments other than in U.S. dollars. For purposes of section 
1441, a payment includes amounts paid in a medium

[[Page 112]]

other than U.S. dollars. See Sec. 1.1441-3(e) for rules regarding the 
amount subject to withholding in the case of such payments.
    (f) Effective date. This section applies to payments made after 
December 31, 2000.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1441-3  Determination of amounts to be withheld.

    (a) Withholding on gross amount. Except as otherwise provided in 
regulations under section 1441, the amount subject to withholding under 
Sec. 1.1441-1 is the gross amount of income subject to withholding that 
is paid to a foreign person. The gross amount of income subject to 
withholding may not be reduced by any deductions, except to the extent 
that one or more personal exemptions are allowed as provided under Sec. 
1.1441-4(b)(6).
    (b) Withholding on payments on certain obligations--(1) Withholding 
at time of payment of interest. When making a payment on an interest-
bearing obligation, a withholding agent must withhold under Sec. 
1.1441-1 upon the gross amount of stated interest payable on the 
interest payment date, regardless of whether the payment constitutes a 
return of capital or the payment of income within the meaning of section 
61. To the extent an amount was withheld on an amount of capital rather 
than interest, see the rules for adjustments, refunds, or credits under 
Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(8).
    (2) No withholding between interest payment dates--(i) In general. A 
withholding agent is not required to withhold under Sec. 1.1441-1 upon 
interest accrued on the date of a sale or exchange of a debt obligation 
when that sale occurs between two interest payment dates (even though 
the amount is treated as interest under Sec. 1.61-7(c) or (d) and is 
subject to tax under section 871 or 881). See Sec. 1.6045-1(c) for 
reporting requirements by brokers with respect to sale proceeds. See 
Sec. 1.61-7(c) regarding the character of payments received by the 
acquirer of an obligation subsequent to such acquisition (that is, as a 
return of capital or interest accrued after the acquisition). Any 
exemption from withholding pursuant to this paragraph (b)(2)(i) applies 
without a requirement that documentation be furnished to the withholding 
agent. However, documentation may have to be furnished for purposes of 
the information reporting provisions under section 6045 or 6049 and 
backup withholding under section 3406. The exemption from withholding 
granted by this paragraph (b)(2) is not a determination that the accrued 
interest is not fixed or determinable annual or periodical income under 
section 871(a) or 881(a).
    (ii) Anti-abuse rule. The exemption in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this 
section does not apply if the sale of securities is part of a plan the 
principal purpose of which is to avoid tax by selling and repurchasing 
securities and the withholding agent has actual knowledge or reason to 
know of such plan.
    (c) Corporate distributions--(1) General rule. A corporation making 
a distribution with respect to its stock or any intermediary (described 
in Sec. 1.1441-1(c)(13)) making a payment of such a distribution is 
required to withhold under section 1441, 1442, or 1443 on the entire 
amount of the distribution, unless it elects to reduce the amount of 
withholding under the provisions of this paragraph (c). Any exceptions 
from withholding provided by this paragraph (c) apply without any 
requirement to furnish documentation to the withholding agent. However, 
documentation may have to be furnished for purposes of the information 
reporting provisions under section 6042 or 6045 and backup withholding 
under section 3406. See Sec. 1.1461-1(c) to determine whether amounts 
excepted from withholding under this section are considered amounts that 
are subject to reporting.
    (2) Exception to withholding on distributions--(i) In general. An 
election described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section is made by 
actually reducing the amount of withholding at the time that the payment 
is made. An intermediary that makes a payment of a distribution is not 
required to reduce the withholding based on the distributing 
corporation's estimates under this paragraph (c)(2) even if the 
distributing corporation itself elects to reduce the withholding on 
payments of

[[Page 113]]

distributions that it itself makes to foreign persons. Conversely, an 
intermediary may elect to reduce the amount of withholding with respect 
to the payment of a distribution even if the distributing corporation 
does not so elect for the payments of distributions that it itself makes 
of distributions to foreign persons. The amounts with respect to which a 
distributing corporation or intermediary may elect to reduce the 
withholding are as follows:
    (A) A distributing corporation or intermediary may elect to not 
withhold on a distribution to the extent it represents a nontaxable 
distribution payable in stock or stock rights.
    (B) A distributing corporation or intermediary may elect to not 
withhold on a distribution to the extent it represents a distribution in 
part or full payment in exchange for stock.
    (C) A distributing corporation or intermediary may elect to not 
withhold on a distribution (actual or deemed) to the extent it is not 
paid out of accumulated earnings and profits or current earnings and 
profits, based on a reasonable estimate determined under paragraph 
(c)(2)(ii) of this section.
    (D) A regulated investment company or intermediary may elect to not 
withhold on a distribution representing a capital gain dividend (as 
defined in section 852(b)(3)(C)) or an exempt interest dividend (as 
defined in section 852(b)(5)(A)) based on the applicable procedures 
described under paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
    (E) A U.S. Real Property Holding Corporation (defined in section 
897(c)(2)) or a real estate investment trust (defined in section 856) or 
intermediary may elect to not withhold on a distribution to the extent 
it is subject to withholding under section 1445 and the regulations 
under that section. See paragraph (c)(4) of this section for applicable 
procedures.
    (ii) Reasonable estimate of accumulated and current earnings and 
profits on the date of payment--(A) General rule. A reasonable estimate 
for purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(i)(C) of this section is a 
determination made by the distributing corporation at a time reasonably 
close to the date of payment of the extent to which the distribution 
will constitute a dividend, as defined in section 316. The determination 
is based upon the anticipated amount of accumulated earnings and profits 
and current earnings and profits for the taxable year in which the 
distribution is made, the distributions made prior to the distribution 
for which the estimate is made and all other relevant facts and 
circumstances. A reasonable estimate may be made based on the procedures 
described in Sec. 31.3406(b)(2)-4(c)(2) of this chapter.
    (B) Procedures in case of underwithholding. A distributing 
corporation or intermediary that is a withholding agent with respect to 
a distribution and that determines at the end of the taxable year in 
which the distribution is made that it underwithheld under section 1441 
on the distribution shall be liable for the amount underwithheld as a 
withholding agent under section 1461. However, for purposes of this 
section and Sec. 1.1461-1, any amount underwithheld paid by a 
distributing corporation, its paying agent, or an intermediary shall not 
be treated as income subject to additional withholding even if that 
amount is treated as additional income to the shareholders unless the 
additional amount is income to the shareholder as a result of a 
contractual arrangement between the parties regarding the satisfaction 
of the shareholder's tax liabilities. In addition, no penalties shall be 
imposed for failure to withhold and deposit the tax if--
    (1) The distributing corporation made a reasonable estimate as 
provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) of this section; and
    (2) Either--
    (i) The corporation or intermediary pays over the underwithheld 
amount on or before the due date for filing a Form 1042 for the calendar 
year in which the distribution is made, pursuant to Sec. 1.1461-2(b); 
or
    (ii) The corporation or intermediary is not a calendar year taxpayer 
and it files an amended return on Form 1042X (or such other form as the 
Commissioner may prescribe) for the calendar year in which the 
distribution is made and pays the underwithheld amount and interest 
within 60 days after the close of the taxable year in which the 
distribution is made.

[[Page 114]]

    (C) Reliance by intermediary on reasonable estimate. For purposes of 
determining whether the payment of a corporate distribution is a 
dividend, a withholding agent that is not the distributing corporation 
may, absent actual knowledge or reason to know otherwise, rely on 
representations made by the distributing corporation regarding the 
reasonable estimate of the anticipated accumulated and current earnings 
and profits made in accordance with paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) of this 
section. Failure by the withholding agent to withhold the required 
amount due to a failure by the distributing corporation to reasonably 
estimate the portion of the distribution treated as a dividend or to 
properly communicate the information to the withholding agent shall be 
imputed to the distributing corporation. In such a case, the Internal 
Revenue Service (IRS) may collect from the distributing corporation any 
underwithheld amount and subject the distributing corporation to 
applicable interest and penalties as a withholding agent.
    (D) Example. The rules of this paragraph (c)(2) are illustrated by 
the following example:

    Example. (i) Facts. Corporation X, a publicly traded corporation 
with both U.S. and foreign shareholders and a calendar year taxpayer, 
has an accumulated deficit in earnings and profits at the close of 2000. 
In 2001, Corporation X generates $1 million of current earnings and 
profits each month and makes an $18 million distribution, resulting in a 
$12 million dividend. Corporation X plans to make an additional $18 
million distribution on October 1, 2002. Approximately one month before 
that date, Corporation X's management receives an internal report from 
its legal and accounting department concerning Corporation X's estimated 
current earnings and profits. The report states that Corporation X 
should generate only $5.1 million of current earnings and profits by the 
close of the third quarter due to costs relating to substantial 
organizational and product changes, but these changes will enable 
Corporation X to generate $1.3 million of earnings and profits monthly 
for the last quarter of the 2002 fiscal year. Thus, the total amount of 
current and earnings and profits for 2002 is estimated to be $9 million.
    (ii) Analysis. Based on the facts in paragraph (i) of this Example, 
including the fact that earnings and profits estimate was made within a 
reasonable time before the distribution, Corporation X can rely on the 
estimate under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) of this section. Therefore, 
Corporation X may treat $9 million of the $18 million of the October 1, 
2002, distribution to foreign shareholders as a non-dividend 
distribution.

    (3) Special rules in the case of distributions from a regulated 
investment company--(i) General rule. If the amount of any distributions 
designated as being subject to section 852(b)(3)(C) or (5)(A) exceeds 
the amount that may be designated under those sections for the taxable 
year, then no penalties will be asserted for any resulting 
underwithholding if the designations were based on a reasonable estimate 
(made pursuant to the same procedures as are described in paragraph 
(c)(2)(ii)(A) of this section) and the adjustments to the amount 
withheld are made within the time period described in paragraph 
(c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section. Any adjustment to the amount of tax due 
and paid to the IRS by the withholding agent as a result of 
underwithholding shall not be treated as a distribution for purposes of 
section 562(c) and the regulations thereunder. Any amount of U.S. tax 
that a foreign shareholder is treated as having paid on the 
undistributed capital gain of a regulated investment company under 
section 852(b)(3)(D) may be claimed by the foreign shareholder as a 
credit or refund under Sec. 1.1464-1.
    (ii) Reliance by intermediary on reasonable estimate. For purposes 
of determining whether a payment is a distribution designated as subject 
to section 852(b) (3)(C) or (5)(A), a withholding agent that is not the 
distributing regulated investment company may, absent actual knowledge 
or reason to know otherwise, rely on the designations that the 
distributing company represents have been made in accordance with 
paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section. Failure by the withholding agent to 
withhold the required amount due to a failure by the regulated 
investment company to reasonably estimate the required amounts or to 
properly communicate the relevant information to the withholding agent 
shall be imputed to the distributing company. In such a case, the IRS 
may collect from the distributing company any underwithheld amount and 
subject

[[Page 115]]

the company to applicable interest and penalties as a withholding agent.
    (4) Coordination with withholding under section 1445--(i) In 
general. A distribution from a U.S. Real Property Holding Corporation 
(USRPHC) (or from a corporation that was a USRPHC at any time during the 
five-year period ending on the date of distribution) with respect to 
stock that is a U.S. real property interest under section 897(c) or from 
a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) with respect to its stock is 
subject to the withholding provisions under section 1441 (or section 
1442 or 1443) and section 1445. A USRPHC making a distribution shall be 
treated as satisfying its withholding obligations under both sections if 
it withholds in accordance with one of the procedures described in 
either paragraph (c)(4)(i) (A) or (B) of this section. A USRPHC must 
apply the same withholding procedure to all the distributions made 
during the taxable year. However, the USRPHC may change the applicable 
withholding procedure from year to year. For rules regarding 
distributions by REITs, see paragraph (c)(4)(i)(C) of this section.
    (A) Withholding under section 1441. The USRPHC may choose to 
withhold on a distribution only under section 1441 (or 1442 or 1443) and 
not under section 1445. In such a case, the USRPHC must withhold under 
section 1441 (or 1442 or 1443) on the full amount of the distribution, 
whether or not any portion of the distribution represents a return of 
basis or capital gain. If a reduced tax rate under an income tax treaty 
applies to the distribution by the USRPHC, then the applicable rate of 
withholding on the distribution shall be no less than 10-percent, unless 
the applicable treaty specifies an applicable lower rate for 
distributions from a USRPHC, in which case the lower rate may apply.
    (B) Withholding under both sections 1441 and 1445. As an alternative 
to the procedure described in paragraph (c)(4)(i)(A) of this section, a 
USRPHC may choose to withhold under both sections 1441 (or 1442 or 1443) 
and 1445 under the procedures set forth in this paragraph (c)(4)(i)(B). 
The USRPHC must make a reasonable estimate of the portion of the 
distribution that is a dividend under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) of this 
section, and must--
    (1) Withhold under section 1441 (or 1442 or 1443) on the portion of 
the distribution that is estimated to be a dividend under paragraph 
(c)(2)(ii)(A) of this section; and
    (2) Withhold under section 1445(e)(3) and Sec. 1.1445-5(e) on the 
remainder of the distribution or on such smaller portion based on a 
withholding certificate obtained in accordance with Sec. 1.1445-
5(e)(2)(iv).
    (C) Coordination with REIT withholding. Withholding is required 
under section 1441 (or 1442 or 1443) on the portion of a distribution 
from a REIT that is not designated as a capital gain dividend, a return 
of basis, or a distribution in excess of a shareholder's adjusted basis 
in the stock of the REIT that is treated as a capital gain under section 
301(c)(3). A distribution in excess of a shareholder's adjusted basis in 
the stock of the REIT is, however, subject to withholding under section 
1445, unless the interest in the REIT is not a U.S. real property 
interest (e.g., an interest in a domestically controlled REIT under 
section 897(h)(2)). In addition, withholding is required under section 
1445 on the portion of the distribution designated by a REIT as a 
capital gain dividend. See Sec. 1.1445-8.
    (ii) Intermediary reliance rule. A withholding agent that is not the 
distributing USRPHC must withhold under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this 
section, but may, absent actual knowledge or reason to know otherwise, 
rely on representations made by the USRPHC regarding the determinations 
required under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section. Failure by the 
withholding agent to withhold the required amount due to a failure by 
the distributing USRPHC to make these determinations in a reasonable 
manner or to properly communicate the determinations to the withholding 
agent shall be imputed to the distributing USRPHC. In such a case, the 
IRS may collect from the distributing USRPHC any underwithheld amount 
and subject the distributing USRPHC to applicable interest and penalties 
as a withholding agent.

[[Page 116]]

    (d) Withholding on payments that include an undetermined amount of 
income--(1) In general. Where the withholding agent makes a payment and 
does not know at the time of payment the amount that is subject to 
withholding because the determination of the source of the income or the 
calculation of the amount of income subject to tax depends upon facts 
that are not known at the time of payment, then the withholding agent 
must withhold an amount under Sec. 1.1441-1 based on the entire amount 
paid that is necessary to assure that the tax withheld is not less than 
30 percent (or other applicable percentage) of the amount that will 
subsequently be determined to be from sources within the United States 
or to be income subject to tax. The amount so withheld shall not exceed 
30 percent of the amount paid. In the alternative, the withholding agent 
may make a reasonable estimate of the amount from U.S. sources or of the 
taxable amount and set aside a corresponding portion of the amount due 
under the transaction and hold such portion in escrow until the amount 
from U.S. sources or the taxable amount can be determined, at which 
point withholding becomes due under Sec. 1.1441-1. See Sec. 1.1441-
1(b)(8) regarding adjustments in the case of overwithholding. The 
provisions of this paragraph (d)(1) shall not apply to the extent that 
other provisions of the regulations under chapter 3 of the Internal 
Revenue Code (Code) specify the amount to be withheld, if any, when the 
withholding agent lacks knowledge at the time of payment (e.g., lack of 
reliable knowledge regarding the status of the payee or beneficial 
owner, addressed in Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3), or lack of knowledge regarding 
the amount of original issue discount under Sec. 1.1441-2(b)(3)).
    (2) Withholding on certain gains. Absent actual knowledge or reason 
to know otherwise, a withholding agent may rely on a claim regarding the 
amount of gain described in Sec. 1.1441-2(c) if the beneficial owner 
withholding certificate, or other appropriate withholding certificate, 
states the beneficial owner's basis in the property giving rise to the 
gain. In the absence of a reliable representation on a withholding 
certificate, the withholding agent must withhold an amount under Sec. 
1.1441-1 that is necessary to assure that the tax withheld is not less 
than 30 percent (or other applicable percentage) of the recognized gain. 
For this purpose, the recognized gain is determined without regard to 
any deduction allowed by the Code from the gains. The amount so withheld 
shall not exceed 30 percent of the amount payable by reason of the 
transaction giving rise to the recognized gain. See Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(8) 
regarding adjustments in the case of overwithholding.
    (e) Payments other than in U.S. dollars--(1) In general. The amount 
of a payment made in a medium other than U.S. dollars is measured by the 
fair market value of the property or services provided in lieu of U.S. 
dollars. The withholding agent may liquidate the property prior to 
payment in order to withhold the required amount of tax under section 
1441 or obtain payment of the tax from an alternative source. However, 
the obligation to withhold under section 1441 is not deferred even if no 
alternative source can be located. Thus, for purposes of withholding 
under chapter 3 of the Code, the provisions of Sec. 31.3406(h)-
2(b)(2)(ii) of this chapter (relating to backup withholding from another 
source) shall not apply. If the withholding agent satisfies the tax 
liability related to such payments, the rules of paragraph (f) of this 
section apply.
    (2) Payments in foreign currency. If the amount subject to 
withholding tax is paid in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, the 
amount of withholding under section 1441 shall be determined by applying 
the applicable rate of withholding to the foreign currency amount and 
converting the amount withheld into U.S. dollars on the date of payment 
at the spot rate (as defined in Sec. 1.988-1(d)(1)) in effect on that 
date. A withholding agent making regular or frequent payments in foreign 
currency may use a month-end spot rate or a monthly average spot rate. A 
spot rate convention must be used consistently for all non-dollar 
amounts withheld and from year to year. Such convention cannot be 
changed without the consent of the Commissioner. The U.S. dollar amount 
so determined shall be

[[Page 117]]

treated by the beneficial owner as the amount of tax paid on the income 
for purposes of determining the final U.S. tax liability and, if 
applicable, claiming a refund or credit of tax.
    (f) Tax liability of beneficial owner satisfied by withholding 
agent--(1) General rule. In the event that the satisfaction of a tax 
liability of a beneficial owner by a withholding agent constitutes 
income to the beneficial owner and such income is of a type that is 
subject to withholding, the amount of the payment deemed made by the 
withholding agent for purposes of this paragraph (f) shall be determined 
under the gross-up formula provided in this paragraph (f)(1). Whether 
the payment of the tax by the withholding agent constitutes a 
satisfaction of the beneficial owner's tax liability and whether, as 
such, it constitutes additional income to the beneficial owner, must be 
determined under all the facts and circumstances surrounding the 
transaction, including any agreements between the parties and applicable 
law. The formula described in this paragraph (f)(1) is as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14OC97.000

    (2) Example. The following example illustrates the provisions of 
this paragraph (f):

    Example. College X awards a qualified scholarship within the meaning 
of section 117(b) to foreign student, FS, who is in the United States on 
an F visa. FS is a resident of a country that does not have an income 
tax treaty with the United States. The scholarship is $20,000 to be 
applied to tuition, mandatory fees and books, plus benefits in kind 
consisting of room and board and roundtrip air transportation. College X 
agrees to pay any U.S. income tax owed by FS with respect to the 
scholarship. The fair market value of the room and board measured by the 
amount College X charges non-scholarship students is $6,000. The cost of 
the roundtrip air transportation is $2,600. Therefore, the total fair 
market value of the scholarship received by FS is $28,600. However, the 
amount taxable is limited to the fair market value of the benefits in 
kind ($8,600) because the portion of the scholarship amount for tuition, 
fees, and books is not included in gross income under section 117. The 
applicable rate of withholding is 14 percent under section 1441(b). 
Therefore, under the gross-up formula, College X is deemed to make a 
payment of $10,000 ($8,600 divided by (1-.14). The U.S. tax that must be 
deducted and withheld from the payment under section 1441(b) is $1,400 
(.14x$10,000). College X reports scholarship income of $30,000 and 
$1,400 of U.S. tax withheld on Forms 1042 and 1042-S.

    (g) Conduit financing arrangements--(1) Duty to withhold. A financed 
entity or other person required to withhold tax under section 1441 with 
respect to a financing arrangement that is a conduit financing 
arrangement within the meaning of Sec. 1.881-3(a)(2)(iv) shall be 
required to withhold under section 1441 as if the district director had 
determined, pursuant to Sec. 1.881-3(a)(3), that all conduit entities 
that are parties to the conduit financing arrangement should be 
disregarded. The amount of tax required to be withheld shall be 
determined under Sec. 1.881-3(d). The withholding agent may withhold 
tax at a reduced rate if the financing entity establishes that it is 
entitled to the benefit of a treaty that provides a reduced rate of tax 
on a payment of the type deemed to have been paid to the financing 
entity. Section 1.881-3(a)(3)(ii)(E) shall not apply for purposes of 
determining whether any person is required to deduct and withhold tax 
pursuant to this paragraph (g), or whether any party to a financing 
arrangement is liable for failure to withhold or entitled to a refund of 
tax under sections 1441 or 1461 to 1464 (except to the extent the amount 
withheld exceeds the tax liability determined under Sec. 1.881-3(d)). 
See Sec. 1.1441-7(f) relating to withholding tax liability of the 
withholding agent in conduit financing arrangements subject to Sec. 
1.881-3.
    (2) Effective date. This paragraph (g) is effective for payments 
made by financed entities on or after September 11, 1995. This paragraph 
shall not apply to interest payments covered by section 127(g)(3) of the 
Tax Reform Act of 1984, and to interest payments with respect to other 
debt obligations issued prior to October 15, 1984 (whether or not such 
debt was issued by a Netherlands Antilles corporation).

[[Page 118]]

    (h) Effective date. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (g) of 
this section, this section applies to payments made after December 31, 
2000.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1441-4  Exemptions from withholding for certain effectively 
connected income and other amounts.

    (a) Certain income connected with a U.S. trade or business--(1) In 
general. No withholding is required under section 1441 on income 
otherwise subject to withholding if the income is (or is deemed to be) 
effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the 
United States and is includible in the beneficial owner's gross income 
for the taxable year. For purposes of this paragraph (a), an amount is 
not deemed to be includible in gross income if the amount is (or is 
deemed to be) effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or 
business within the United States and the beneficial owner claims an 
exemption from tax under an income tax treaty because the income is not 
attributable to a permanent establishment in the United States. To claim 
a reduced rate of withholding because the income is not attributable to 
a permanent establishment, see Sec. 1.1441-6(b)(1). This paragraph (a) 
does not apply to income of a foreign corporation to which section 
543(a)(7) applies for the taxable year or to compensation for personal 
services performed by an individual. See paragraph (b) of this section 
for compensation for personal services performed by an individual.
    (2) Withholding agent's reliance on a claim of effectively connected 
income--(i) In general. Absent actual knowledge or reason to know 
otherwise, a withholding agent may rely on a claim of exemption based 
upon paragraph (a)(1) of this section if, prior to the payment to the 
foreign person, the withholding agent can reliably associate the payment 
with a Form W-8 upon which it can rely to treat the payment as made to a 
foreign beneficial owner in accordance with Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(1)(ii). 
For purposes of this paragraph (a), a withholding certificate is valid 
only if, in addition to other applicable requirements, it includes the 
taxpayer identifying number of the person whose name is on the Form W-8 
and represents, under penalties of perjury, that the amounts for which 
the certificate is furnished are effectively connected with the conduct 
of a trade or business in the United States and is includable in the 
beneficial owner's gross income for the taxable year. In the absence of 
a reliable claim that the income is effectively connected with the 
conduct of a trade or business in the United States, the income is 
presumed not to be effectively connected, except as otherwise provided 
in paragraph (a) (2)(ii) or (3) of this section. See Sec. 1.1441-
1(e)(4)(ii)(C) for the period of validity applicable to a certificate 
provided under this section and Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(4)(ii)(D) for changes 
in circumstances arising during the taxable year indicating that the 
income to which the certificate relates is not, or is no longer expected 
to be, effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business 
within the United States. A withholding certificate shall be effective 
only for the item or items of income specified therein. The provisions 
of Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iv) dealing with a 90-day grace period shall 
apply for purposes of this section.
    (ii) Special rules for U.S. branches of foreign persons--(A) U.S. 
branches of certain foreign banks or foreign insurance companies. A 
payment to a U.S. branch described in Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv)(A) is 
presumed to be effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or 
business in the United States without the need to furnish a certificate, 
unless the U.S. branch provides a U.S. branch withholding certificate 
described in Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(3)(v) that represents otherwise. If no 
certificate is furnished but the income is not, in fact, effectively 
connected income, then the branch must withhold whether the payment is 
collected on behalf of other persons or on behalf of another branch of 
the same entity. See Sec. 1.1441-1(b) (2)(iv) and (6) for general rules 
applicable to payments to U.S. branches of foreign persons.

[[Page 119]]

    (B) Other U.S. branches. See Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv)(E) for similar 
procedures for other U.S. branches to the extent provided in a 
determination letter from the district director or the Assistant 
Commissioner (International).
    (3) Income on notional principal contracts--(i) General rule. A 
withholding agent that pays amounts attributable to a notional principal 
contract described in Sec. 1.863-7(a) or 1.988-2(e) shall have no 
obligation to withhold on the amounts paid under the terms of the 
notional principal contract regardless of whether a withholding 
certificate is provided. However, a withholding agent must file returns 
under Sec. 1.1461-1(b) and (c) reporting the income that it must treat 
as effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the 
United States under the provisions of this paragraph (a)(3). Except as 
otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, a 
withholding agent must treat the income as effectively connected with 
the conduct of a U.S. trade or business if the income is paid to, or to 
the account of, a qualified business unit of a foreign person located in 
the United States or, if the payment is paid to, or to the account of, a 
qualified business unit of a foreign person located outside the United 
States, the withholding agent knows, or has reason to know, the payment 
is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within 
the United States. Income on a notional principal contract does not 
include the amount characterized as interest under the provisions of 
Sec. 1.446-3(g)(4).
    (ii) Exception for certain payments. A payment shall not be treated 
as effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within 
the United States for purposes of paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section 
even if no withholding certificate is furnished if the payee provides a 
representation in a master agreement that governs the transactions in 
notional principal contracts between the parties (for example an 
International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Agreement, 
including the Schedule thereto) or in the confirmation on the particular 
notional principal contract transaction that the payee is a U.S. person 
or a non-U.S. branch of a foreign person.
    (b) Compensation for personal services of an individual--(1) 
Exemption from withholding. Withholding is not required under Sec. 
1.1441-1 from salaries, wages, remuneration, or any other compensation 
for personal services of a nonresident alien individual if such 
compensation is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or 
business within the United States and--
    (i) Such compensation is subject to withholding under section 3402 
(relating to withholding on wages) and the regulations under that 
section;
    (ii) Such compensation would be subject to withholding under section 
3402 but for the provisions of section 3401(a) (not including section 
3401(a)(6)) and the regulations under that section. This paragraph 
(b)(1)(ii) does not apply to payments to a nonresident alien individual 
from any trust described in section 401(a), any annuity plan described 
in section 403(a), any annuity, custodial account, or retirement income 
account described in section 403(b), or an individual retirement account 
or individual retirement annuity described in section 408. Instead, 
these payments are subject to withholding under this section to the 
extent they are exempted from the definition of wages under section 
3401(a)(12) or to the extent they are from an annuity, custodial 
account, or retirement income account described in section 403(b), or an 
individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity described 
in section 408. Thus, for example, payments to a nonresident alien 
individual from a trust described in section 401(a) are subject to 
withholding under section 1441 and not under section 3405 or section 
3406.
    (iii) Such compensation is for services performed by a nonresident 
alien individual who is a resident of Canada or Mexico and who enters 
and leaves the United States at frequent intervals;
    (iv) Such compensation is, or will be, exempt from the income tax 
imposed by chapter 1 of the Code by reason of a provision of the 
Internal Revenue Code or a tax treaty to which the United States is a 
party;

[[Page 120]]

    (v) Such compensation is paid after January 3, 1979 as a commission 
or rebate paid by a ship supplier to a nonresident alien individual, who 
is employed by a nonresident alien individual, foreign partnership, or 
foreign corporation in the operation of a ship or ships of foreign 
registry, for placing orders for supplies to be used in the operation of 
such ship or ships with the supplier. See section 162(c) and the 
regulations thereunder for denial of deductions for illegal bribes, 
kickbacks, and other payments; or
    (vi) Compensation that is exempt from withholding under section 3402 
by reason of section 3402(e), provided that the employee and his 
employer enter into an agreement under section 3402(p) to provide for 
the withholding of income tax upon payments of amounts described in 
Sec. 31.3401(a)-3(b)(1) of this chapter. An employee who desires to 
enter into such an agreement should furnish his employer with Form W-4 
(withholding exemption certificate) (or such other form as the Internal 
Revenue Service (IRS) may prescribe). See section 3402(f) and the 
regulations thereunder and Sec. 31.3402(p)-1 of this chapter.
    (2) Manner of obtaining withholding exemption under tax treaty--(i) 
In general. In order to obtain the exemption from withholding by reason 
of a tax treaty, provided by paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section, a 
nonresident alien individual must submit a withholding certificate 
(described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section) to each withholding 
agent from whom amounts are to be received. A separate withholding 
certificate must be filed for each taxable year of the alien individual. 
If the withholding agent is satisfied that an exemption from withholding 
is warranted (see paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section), the 
withholding certificate shall be accepted in the manner set forth in 
paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section. The exemption from withholding 
becomes effective for payments made at least ten days after a copy of 
the accepted withholding certificate is forwarded to the Assistant 
Commissioner (International). The withholding agent may rely on an 
accepted withholding certificate only if the IRS has not objected to the 
certificate. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(i), the IRS will be 
considered to have not objected to the certificate if it has not 
notified the withholding agent within a 10-day period beginning from the 
date that the withholding certificate is forwarded to the IRS pursuant 
to paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section. After expiration of the 10-day 
period, the withholding agent may rely on the withholding certificate 
retroactive to the date of the first payment covered by the certificate. 
The fact that the IRS does not object to the withholding certificate 
within the 10-day period provided in this paragraph (b)(2)(i) shall not 
preclude the IRS from examining the withholding agent at a later date in 
light of facts that the withholding agent knew or had reason to know 
regarding the payment and eligibility for a reduced rate and that were 
not disclosed to the IRS as part of the 10-day review process.
    (ii) Withholding certificate claiming withholding exemption. The 
statement claiming an exemption from withholding shall be made on Form 
8233 (or an acceptable substitute or such other form as the IRS may 
prescribe). Form 8233 shall be dated, signed by the beneficial owner 
under penalties of perjury, and contain the following information--
    (A) The individual's name, permanent residence address, taxpayer 
identifying number (or a copy of a completed Form W-7 or SS-5 showing 
that a number has been applied for), and the U.S. visa number, if any;
    (B) The individual's current immigration status and visa type;
    (C) The individual's original date of entry into the United States;
    (D) The country that issued the individual's passport and the number 
of such passport, or the individual's permanent address if a citizen of 
Canada or Mexico;
    (E) The taxable year for which the statement is to apply, the 
compensation to which it relates, and the amount (or estimated amount if 
exact amount not known) of such compensation;
    (F) A statement that the individual is not a citizen or resident of 
the United States;
    (G) The number of personal exemptions claimed by the individual;

[[Page 121]]

    (H) A statement as to whether the compensation to be paid to him or 
her during the taxable year is or will be exempt from income tax and the 
reason why the compensation is exempt;
    (I) If the compensation is exempt from withholding by reason of an 
income tax treaty to which the United States is a party, the tax treaty 
and provision under which the exemption from withholding is claimed and 
the country of which the individual is a resident;
    (J) Sufficient facts to justify the claim in exemption from 
withholding; and
    (K) Any other information as may be required by the form or 
accompanying instructions in addition to, or in lieu of, the information 
described in this paragraph (b)(2)(ii).
    (iii) Review by withholding agent. The exemption from withholding 
provided by paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section shall not apply unless 
the withholding agent accepts (in the manner provided in paragraph 
(b)(2)(iv) of this section) the statement on Form 8233 supplied by the 
nonresident alien individual. Before accepting the statement the 
withholding agent must examine the statement. If the withholding agent 
knows or has reason to know that any of the facts or assertions on Form 
8233 may be false or that the eligibility of the individual's 
compensation for the exemption cannot be readily determined, the 
withholding agent may not accept the statement on Form 8233 and is 
required to withhold under this section. If the withholding agent 
accepts the statement and subsequently finds that any of the facts or 
assertions contained on Form 8233 may be false or that the eligibility 
of the individual's compensation for the exemption can no longer be 
readily determined, then the withholding agent shall promptly so notify 
the Assistant Commissioner (International) by letter, and the 
withholding agent is not relieved of liability to withhold on any 
amounts still to be paid. If the withholding agent is notified by the 
Assistant Commissioner (International) that the eligibility of the 
individual's compensation for the exemption is in doubt or that such 
compensation is not eligible for the exemption, the withholding agent is 
required to withhold under this section. The rules of this paragraph are 
illustrated by the following examples.

    Example 1. C, a nonresident alien individual, submits Form 8233 to 
W, a withholding agent. The statement on Form 8233 does not include all 
the information required by paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. 
Therefore, W has reason to know that he or she cannot readily determine 
whether C's compensation for personal services is eligible for an 
exemption from withholding and, therefore, W must withhold.
    Example 2. D, a nonresident alien, is performing services for W, a 
withholding agent. W has accepted a statement on Form 8233 submitted by 
D, according to the provisions of this section. W receives notice from 
the Internal Revenue Service that the eligibility of D's compensation 
for a withholding exemption is in doubt. Therefore, W has reason to know 
that the eligibility of the compensation for a withholding exemption 
cannot be readily determined, as of the date W receives the 
notification, and W must withhold tax under section 1441 on amounts paid 
after receipt of the notification.
    Example 3. E, a nonresident alien individual, submits Form 8233 to 
W, a withholding agent for whom E is to perform personal services. The 
statement contains all the information requested on Form 8233. E claims 
an exemption from withholding based on a personal exemption amount 
computed on the number of days E will perform personal services for W in 
the United States. If W does not know or have reason to know that any 
statement on the Form 8233 is false or that the eligibility of E's 
compensation for the withholding exemption cannot be readily determined, 
W can accept the statement on Form 8233 and exempt from withholding the 
appropriate amount of E's income.

    (iv) Acceptance by withholding agent. If after the review described 
in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section the withholding agent is 
satisfied that an exemption from withholding is warranted, the 
withholding agent may accept the statement by making a certification, 
verified by a declaration

that it is made under the penalties of perjury, on Form 8233. The 
certification shall be--
    (A) That the withholding agent has examined the statement,
    (B) That the withholding agent is satisfied that an exemption from 
withholding is warranted, and
    (C) That the withholding agent does not know or have reason to know 
that the individual's compensation is not

[[Page 122]]

entitled to the exemption or that the eligibility of the individual's 
compensation for the exemption cannot be readily determined.
    (v) Copies of Form 8233. The withholding agent shall forward one 
copy of each Form 8233 that is accepted under paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of 
this section to the Assistant Commissioner (International), within five 
days of such acceptance. The withholding agent shall retain a copy of 
Form 8233.
    (3) Withholding agreements. Compensation for personal services of a 
nonresident alien individual who is engaged during the taxable year in 
the conduct of a trade or business within the United States may be 
wholly or partially exempted from the withholding required by Sec. 
1.1441-1 if an agreement is reached between the Assistant Commissioner 
(International) and the alien individual with respect to the amount of 
withholding required. Such agreement shall be available in the 
circumstances and in the manner set forth by the Internal Revenue 
Service, and shall be effective for payments covered by the agreement 
that are made after the agreement is executed by all parties. The alien 
individual must agree to timely file an income tax return for the 
current taxable year.
    (4) Final payment exemption--(i) General rule. Compensation for 
independent personal services of a nonresident alien individual who is 
engaged during the taxable year in the conduct of a trade or business 
within the United States may be wholly or partially exempted from the 
withholding required by Sec. 1.1441-1 from the final payment of 
compensation for independent personal services. This exemption does not 
apply to wages. This exemption from withholding is available only once 
during an alien individual's taxable year and is obtained by the alien 
individual presenting to the withholding agent a letter in duplicate 
from a district director stating the amount of compensation subject to 
the exemption and the amount that would otherwise be withheld from such 
final payment under section 1441 that shall be paid to the alien 
individual due to the exemption. The alien individual shall attach a 
copy of the letter to his or her income tax return for the taxable year 
for which the exemption is effective.
    (ii) Final payment of compensation for personal services. For 
purposes of this paragraph, final payment of compensation for personal 
services means the last payment of compensation, other than wages, for 
personal services rendered within the United States that the individual 
expects to receive from any withholding agent during the taxable year.
    (iii) Manner of applying for final payment exemption. In order to 
obtain the final payment exemption provided by paragraph (b)(4)(i) of 
this section, the nonresident alien individual (or his or her agent) 
must file the forms and provide the information required by the district 
director. Ordinary and necessary business expenses may be taken into 
account if substantiated to the satisfaction of the district director. 
The alien individual must submit a statement, signed by him or her and 
verified by a declaration that it is made under the penalties of 
perjury, that all the information provided is true and that to his or 
her knowledge no relevant information has been omitted. The information 
required to be submitted includes, but is not limited to--
    (A) A statement by each withholding agent from whom amounts of gross 
income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business 
within the United States have been received by the alien individual 
during the taxable year, of the amount of such income paid and the 
amount of tax withheld, signed and verified by a declaration that it is 
made under penalties of perjury;
    (B) A statement by the withholding agent from whom the final payment 
of compensation for personal services will be received, of the amount of 
such final payment and the amount which would be withheld under Sec. 
1.1441-1 if a final payment exemption under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this 
section is not granted, signed and verified by a declaration that it is 
made under penalties of perjury;
    (C) A statement by the individual that he or she does not intend to 
receive any other amounts of gross income effectively connected with the

[[Page 123]]

conduct of a trade or business within the United States during the 
current taxable year;
    (D) The amount of tax which has been withheld (or paid) under any 
other provision of the Code or regulations with respect to any income 
effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the 
United States during the current taxable year;
    (E) The amount of any outstanding tax liabilities (and interest and 
penalties relating thereto) from the current taxable year or prior 
taxable periods; and
    (F) The provision of any income tax treaty under which a partial or 
complete exemption from withholding may be claimed, the country of the 
individual's residence, and a statement of sufficient facts to justify 
an exemption pursuant to such treaty.
    (iv) Letter to withholding agent. If the district director is 
satisfied that the information provided under paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of 
this section is sufficient, the district director will, after 
coordination with the Director of the Foreign Operations District, 
ascertain the amount of the alien individual's tentative income tax for 
the taxable year with respect to gross income that is effectively 
connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United 
States. After the tentative tax has been ascertained, the district 
director will provide the alien individual with a letter to the 
withholding agent stating the amount of the final payment of 
compensation for personal services that is exempt from withholding, and 
the amount that would otherwise be withheld under section 1441 that 
shall be paid to the alien individual due to the exemption. The amount 
of compensation for personal services exempt from withholding under this 
paragraph (b)(4) shall not exceed $5,000.

    Example 1. On July 15, 1983, B, a non-resident alien individual, 
appears before a district director with the information required by 
paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section. B has received personal service 
income in 1983 from which $3,000 has been withheld under section 1441. 
On August 1, 1983, B will receive $5,000 in personal service income from 
W. B does not intend to receive any other income subject to U.S. tax 
during 1983. Taking into account B's substantiated deductible business 
expenses, the district director computes the tentative tax liability on 
B's income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business 
in the United States during 1983 (including the $5,000 payment to be 
made on August 1, 1983) to be $3,300. B does not owe U.S. tax for any 
other taxable periods. The amount of B's final payment exemption is 
determined as follows:
    (1) The amount of total withholding is $4,500 ($3,000 previously 
withheld plus $1,500, 30% of the $5,000 final payment);
    (2) The amount of tentative excess withholding is $1,200 (total 
withholding of $4,500 minus B's tentative tax liability of $3,300); and
    (3) To allow B to receive $1,200 of the amount which would otherwise 
have been withheld from the final payment, the district director allows 
a withholding exemption for $4,000 of B's final payment. W must withhold 
$300 from the final payment.
    Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1 except B will 
receive a final payment of compensation on August 1, 1983, in the amount 
of $10,000 and B's tentative tax liability is $3,900. The amount of B's 
final payment exemption is determined as follows:
    (1) The amount of total withholding is $6,000 ($3,000 previously 
withheld plus $3,000, 30% of the $10,000 final payment);
    (2) The amount of tentative excess withholding is $2,100 (total 
withholding of $6,000 minus B's tentative tax liability of $3,900); and
    (3) To allow B to receive $2,100 of the amount which would otherwise 
be withheld from the final payment, $7,000 of the final payment would 
have to be exempt from withholding; however, as no more than $5,000 of 
the final payment can be exempt from withholding under this paragraph 
(b)(4), the district director allows a withholding exemption for $5,000 
of B's final payment. B must file a claim for refund at the end of the 
taxable year to obtain a refund of $600. W must withhold $1,500 from the 
final payment.

    (5) Requirement of return. The tentative tax determined by the 
district director under paragraph (b)(4)(iv) of this section or by the 
Director of the Foreign Operations District under the withholding 
agreement procedure of paragraph (b)(3) of this section shall not 
constitute a final determination of the income tax liability of the 
nonresident alien individual, nor shall such determination constitute a 
tax return of the nonresident alien individual for any taxable period. 
An alien individual who applies for or obtains an exemption from 
withholding under the procedures of paragraphs (b) (2), (3), or (4) of 
this section is not relieved of the

[[Page 124]]

obligation to file a return of income under section 6012.
    (6) Personal exemption--(i) In general. To determine the tax to be 
withheld at source under Sec. 1.1441-1 from remuneration paid for 
personal services performed within the United States by a nonresident 
alien individual and from scholarship and fellowship income described in 
paragraph (c) of this section, a withholding agent may take into account 
one personal exemption pursuant to sections 873(b)(3) and 151 regardless 
of whether the income is effectively connected. For purposes of 
withholding under section 1441 on remuneration for personal services, 
the exemption must be prorated upon a daily basis for the period during 
which the personal services are performed within the United States by 
the nonresident alien individual by dividing by 365 the number of days 
in the period during which the individual is present in the United 
States for the purpose of performing the services and multiplying the 
result by the amount of the personal exemption in effect for the taxable 
year. See Sec. 31.3402(f)(6)-1 of this chapter.
    (ii) Multiple exemptions. More than one personal exemption may be 
claimed in the case of a resident of a contiguous country or a national 
of the United States under section 873(b)(3). In addition, residents of 
a country with which the United States has an income tax treaty in 
effect may be eligible to claim more than one personal exemption if the 
treaty so provides. Claims for more than one personal exemption shall be 
made on the withholding certificate furnished to the withholding agent. 
The exemption must be prorated on a daily basis in the same manner as 
described in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section.
    (iii) Special rule where both certain scholarship and compensation 
income are received. The fact that both non-compensatory scholarship 
income and compensation income (including compensatory scholarship 
income) are received during the taxable year does not entitle the 
taxpayer to claim more than one personal exemption amount (or more than 
the additional amounts permitted under paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this 
section). Thus, if a nonresident alien student receives non-compensatory 
taxable scholarship income from one withholding agent and compensation 
income from another withholding agent, no more than the total personal 
exemption amount permitted under the Internal Revenue Code or under an 
income tax treaty may be taken into account by both withholding agents. 
For this purpose, the withholding agent may rely on a representation 
from the beneficial owner that the exemption amount claimed does not 
exceed the amount permissible under this section.
    (c) Special rules for scholarship and fellowship income--(1) In 
general. Under section 871(c), certain amounts paid as a scholarship or 
fellowship for study, training, or research in the United States to a 
nonresident alien individual temporarily present in the United States as 
a nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15) (F), (J), (M), or (Q) of the 
Immigration and Nationality Act are treated as income effectively 
connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United 
States. The amounts described in the preceding sentence are those 
amounts that do not represent compensation for services. Such amounts 
(as described in the second sentence of section 1441(b)) are subject to 
withholding under section 1441, but at the lower rate of 14 percent. 
That rate may be reduced under the provisions of an income tax treaty. 
Claims of a reduced rate under an income tax treaty shall be made under 
the procedures described in Sec. 1.1441-6(b)(1). Therefore, claims for 
reduction in withholding under an income tax treaty on amounts described 
in this paragraph (c)(1) may not be made on a Form 8233. However, if the 
payee is receiving both compensation for personal services (including 
compensatory scholarship income) and non-compensatory scholarship income 
described in this paragraph (c)(1) from the same withholding agent, 
claims for reduction of withholding on both types of income may be made 
on Form 8233.
    (2) Alternate withholding election. A withholding agent may elect to 
withhold on the amounts described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section at 
the rates applicable under section 3402, as if the income were wages. 
Such election shall be made by obtaining a Form W-4 (or an acceptable 
substitute or such other

[[Page 125]]

form as the IRS may prescribe) from the beneficial owner. The fact that 
the withholding agent asks the beneficial owner to furnish a Form W-4 
for such fellowship or scholarship income or to take such income into 
account in preparing such Form W-4 shall serve as notice to the 
beneficial owner that the income is being treated as wages for purposes 
of withholding tax under section 1441.
    (d) Annuities received under qualified plans. Withholding is not 
required under section Sec. 1.1441-1 in the case of any amount received 
as an annuity if the amount is exempt from tax under section 871(f) and 
the regulations under that section. The withholding agent may exempt the 
payment from withholding if, prior to payment, it can reliably associate 
the payment with documentation upon which it can rely to treat the 
payment as made to a beneficial owner in accordance with Sec. 1.1441-
1(e)(1)(ii). A beneficial owner withholding certificate furnished for 
purposes of claiming the benefits of the exemption under this paragraph 
(d) is valid only if, in addition to other applicable requirements, it 
contains a taxpayer identifying number.
    (e) Per diem of certain alien trainees. Withholding is not required 
under section 1441(a) and Sec. 1.1441-1 on per diem amounts paid for 
subsistence by the United States Government (directly or by contract) to 
any nonresident alien individual who is engaged in any program of 
training in the United States under the Mutual Security Act of 1954, as 
amended (22 U.S.C. chapter 24). This rule shall apply even though such 
amounts are subject to tax under section 871. Any exemption from 
withholding pursuant to this paragraph (e) applies without a requirement 
that documentation be furnished to the withholding agent. However, 
documentation may have to be furnished for purposes of the information 
reporting provisions under section 6041 and backup withholding under 
section 3406. The exemption from withholding granted by this paragraph 
(e) is not a determination that the amounts are not fixed or 
determinable annual or periodical income.
    (f) Failure to receive withholding certificates timely or to act in 
accordance with applicable presumptions. See applicable procedures 
described in Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(7) in the event the withholding agent 
does not hold an appropriate withholding certificate or other 
appropriate documentation at the time of payment or does not act in 
accordance with applicable presumptions described in paragraph (a) 
(2)(i), (2)(ii), or (3) of this section.
    (g) Effective date--(1) General rule. This section applies to 
payments made after December 31, 2000.
    (2) Transition rules. The validity of a Form 4224 or 8233 that was 
valid on January 1, 1998, under the regulations in effect prior to 
January 1, 2001 (see 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 1999) and expired, 
or will expire, at any time during 1998, is extended until December 31, 
1998. The validity of a Form 4224 or 8233 that is valid on or after 
January 1, 1999, remains valid until its validity expires under the 
regulations in effect prior to January 1, 2001 (see 26 CFR part 1, 
revised April 1, 1999) but in no event will such form remain valid after 
December 31, 2000. The rule in this paragraph (g)(2), however, does not 
apply to extend the validity period of a Form 4224 or 8223 that expires 
solely by reason of changes in the circumstances of the person whose 
name is on the certificate. Notwithstanding the first three sentences of 
this paragraph (g)(2), a withholding agent may choose to not take 
advantage of the transition rule in this paragraph (g)(2) with respect 
to one or more withholding certificates valid under the regulations in 
effect prior to January 1, 2001 (see 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 
1999) and, therefore, to require withholding certificates conforming to 
the requirements described in this section (new withholding 
certificates). For purposes of this section, a new withholding 
certificate is deemed to satisfy the documentation requirement under the 
regulations in effect prior to January 1, 2001 (see 26 CFR part 1, 
revised April 1, 1999). Further, a new withholding certificate remains 
valid for the period specified in Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(4)(ii), regardless 
of when the certificate is obtained.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1441-5  Withholding on payments to partnerships, trusts, and estates.

    (a) In general. This section describes the rules that apply to 
payments made to partnerships, trusts, and estates. Paragraph (b) of 
this section prescribes the rules that apply to a withholding agent 
making a payment to a U.S. partnership, trust, or estate. It also 
prescribes the obligations of a U.S. partnership, trust, or estate that 
makes a payment to a foreign partner, beneficiary, or owner. Paragraph 
(c) of this section prescribes rules that apply to a withholding agent 
that makes a payment to a foreign partnership. Paragraph (d) of this 
section provides presumption rules that apply to payments made to 
foreign partnerships. Paragraph (e) of this section prescribes rules, 
including presumption rules, that apply to a withholding agent that 
makes a payment to a foreign trust or foreign estate.
    (b) Rules applicable to U.S. partnerships, trusts, and estates--(1) 
Payments to U.S. partnerships, trusts, and estates. No withholding is 
required under section 1.1441-1(b)(1) on a payment of an amount subject 
to withholding (as defined in Sec. 1.1441-2(a)) that a withholding 
agent may treat as made to a U.S. payee. Therefore, if a withholding 
agent can reliably associate (within the meaning of Sec. 1.1441-
2(b)(vii)) a Form W-9 provided in accordance with Sec. 1.1441-1(d)(2) 
or (4) by a U.S. partnership, U.S. trust, or a U.S. estate the 
withholding agent may treat the payment as made to a U.S. payee and the 
payment is not subject to withholding under section 1441 even though the 
partnership, trust, or estate may have foreign partners, beneficiaries, 
or owners. A withholding agent is also not required to withhold under 
section 1441 on a payment it makes to an entity presumed to be a U.S. 
payee under paragraphs (d)(2) and (e)(6)(ii) of this section.
    (2) Withholding by U.S. payees--(i) U.S. partnerships--(A) In 
general. A U.S. partnership is required to withhold under Sec. 1.1441-1 
as a withholding agent on an amount subject to withholding (as defined 
in Sec. 1.1441-2(a)) that is includible in the gross income of a 
partner that is a foreign person. Subject to paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this 
section, a U.S. partnership shall withhold when any distributions that 
include amounts subject to withholding (including guaranteed payments 
made by a U.S. partnership) are made. To the extent a foreign partner's 
distributive share of income subject to withholding has not actually 
been distributed to the foreign partner, the U.S. partnership must 
withhold on the foreign partner's distributive share of the income on 
the earlier of the date that the statement required under section 
6031(b) is mailed or otherwise provided to the partner or the due date 
for furnishing the statement.
    (B) Effectively connected income of partners. Withholding on items 
of income that are effectively connected income in the hands of the 
partners who are foreign persons is governed by section 1446 and not by 
this section. In such a case, partners in a domestic partnership are not 
required to furnish a withholding certificate in order to claim an 
exemption from withholding under section 1441(c)(1) and Sec. 1.1441-4.
    (ii) U.S. simple trusts. A U.S. trust that is described in section 
651(a) (a U.S. simple trust) is required to withhold under chapter 3 of 
the Internal Revenue Code as a withholding agent on the distributable 
net income includible in the gross income of a foreign beneficiary to 
the extent the distributable net income is an amount subject to 
withholding (as defined in Sec. 1.1441-2(a)). A U.S. simple trust shall 
withhold when a distribution is made to a foreign beneficiary. The U.S. 
trust may make a reasonable estimate of the portion of the distribution 
that constitutes distributable net income consisting of an amount 
subject to withholding and apply the appropriate rate of withholding to 
the estimated amount. If, at the end of the taxable year in which the 
distribution is made, the U.S. simple trust determines that it 
underwithheld under section 1441 or 1442, the trust shall be liable as a 
withholding agent for the amount under withheld under section 1461. No 
penalties shall be imposed for failure to withhold and deposit the tax 
if the U.S. simple trust's estimate was reasonable

[[Page 127]]

and the trust pays the underwithheld amount on or before the due date of 
Form 1042 under section 1461. Any payment of underwithheld amounts by 
the U.S. simple trust shall not be treated as income subject to 
additional withholding even if that amount is treated as additional 
income to the foreign beneficiary, unless the additional amount is 
income to the foreign beneficiary as a result of a contractual 
arrangement between the parties regarding the satisfaction of the 
foreign beneficiary's tax liability. To the extent a U.S. simple trust 
is required to, but does not, distribute such income to a foreign 
beneficiary, the U.S. trust must withhold on the foreign beneficiary's 
allocable share at the time the income is required (without extension) 
to be reported on Form 1042-S under Sec. 1.1461-1(c).
    (iii) U.S. complex trusts and U.S. estates. A U.S. trust that is not 
a trust described in section 651(a) (a U.S. complex trust) is required 
to withhold under chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code as a 
withholding agent on the distributable net income includible in the 
gross income of a foreign beneficiary to the extent the distributable 
net income consists of an amount subject to withholding (as defined in 
Sec. 1.1441-2(a)) that is, or is required to be, distributed currently. 
The U.S. complex trust shall withhold when a distribution is made to a 
foreign beneficiary. The trust may use the same procedures regarding an 
estimate of the amount subject to withholding as a U.S. simple trust 
under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. To the extent an amount 
subject to withholding is required to be, but is not actually 
distributed, the U.S. complex trust must withhold on the foreign 
beneficiary's allocable share at the time the income is required to be 
reported on Form 1042-S under Sec. 1.1461-1(c), without extension. A 
U.S. estate is required to withhold under chapter 3 of the Internal 
Revenue Code on the distributable net income includible in the gross 
income of a foreign beneficiary to the extent the distributable net 
income consists of an amount subject to withholding (as defined in Sec. 
1.1441-2(a)) that is actually distributed. A U.S. estate may also use 
the reasonable estimate procedures of paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this 
section. However, those procedures apply to an estate that has a taxable 
year other than a calendar year only if the estate files an amended 
return on Form 1042 for the calendar year in which the distribution was 
made and pays the underwithheld tax and interest within 60 days after 
the close of the taxable year in which the distribution was made.
    (iv) U.S. grantor trusts. A U.S. trust that is described in section 
671 through 679 (a U.S. grantor trust) must withhold on any income 
includible in the gross income of a foreign person that is treated as an 
owner of the grantor trust to the extent the amount includible consists 
of an amount that is subject to withholding (as described in Sec. 
1.1441-2(a)). The withholding must occur at the time the income is 
received by, or credited to, the trust.
    (v) Subsequent distribution. If a U.S. partnership or U.S. trust 
withholds on a foreign partner, beneficiary, or owner's share of an 
amount subject to withholding before the amount is actually distributed 
to the partner, beneficiary, or owner, withholding is not required when 
the amount is subsequently distributed.
    (c) Foreign partnerships--(1) Determination of payee--(i) Payments 
treated as made to partners. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph 
(c)(1)(ii) of this section, the payees of a payment to a person that the 
withholding agent may treat as a nonwithholding foreign partnership 
under paragraph (c)(3)(i) or (d)(2) of this section are the partners 
(looking through partners that are foreign intermediaries or flow-
through entities) as follows--
    (A) If the withholding agent can reliably associate a partner's 
distributive share of the payment with a valid Form W-9 provided under 
Sec. 1.1441-1(d), the partner is a U.S. payee;
    (B) If the withholding agent can reliably associate a partner's 
distributive share of the payment with a valid Form W-8, or other 
appropriate documentation, provided under Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(1)(ii), the 
partner is a payee that is a foreign beneficial owner;
    (C) If the withholding agent can reliably associate a partner's 
distributive share of the payment with a qualified

[[Page 128]]

intermediary withholding certificate under Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(3)(ii), a 
nonqualified intermediary withholding certificate under Sec. 1.1441-
1(e)(3)(iii), or a U.S. branch certificate under Sec. 1.1441-
1(e)(3)(v), then the rules of Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(2)(v) shall apply to 
determine who the payee is in the same manner as if the partner's 
distributive share of the payment had been paid directly to such 
intermediary or U.S. branch;
    (D) If the withholding agent can reliably associate the partner's 
distributive share with a withholding foreign partnership certificate 
under paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section or a nonwithholding foreign 
partnership certificate under paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section, 
then the rules of this paragraph (c)(1)(i) or paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of 
this section shall apply to determine whether the payment is treated as 
made to the partners of the higher-tier partnership under this paragraph 
(c)(1)(i) or to the higher-tier partnership itself (under the rules of 
paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section) in the same manner as if the 
partner's distributive share of the payment had been paid directly to 
the higher-tier foreign partnership;
    (E) If the withholding agent can reliably associate the partner's 
distributive share with a withholding certificate described in paragraph 
(e) of this section regarding a foreign trust or estate, then the rules 
of paragraph (e) of this section shall apply to determine who the payees 
are; and
    (F) If the withholding agent cannot reliably associate the partner's 
distributive share with a withholding certificate or other appropriate 
documentation, the partners are considered to be the payees and the 
presumptions described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section shall apply 
to determine their classification and status.
    (ii) Payments treated as made to the partnership. A payment to a 
person that the withholding agent may treat as a foreign partnership is 
treated as a payment to the foreign partnership and not to its partners 
only if--
    (A) The withholding agent can reliably associate the payment with a 
withholding certificate described in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this 
section (withholding certificate of a withholding foreign partnership);
    (B) The withholding agent can reliably associate the payment with a 
withholding certificate described in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this 
section (nonwithholding foreign partnership) certifying that the payment 
is income that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or 
business in the United States; or
    (C) The withholding agent can treat the income as effectively 
connected income under the presumption rules of Sec. 1.1441-4(a)(2)(ii) 
or (3)(i).
    (iii) Rules for reliably associating a payment with documentation. 
For rules regarding the reliable association of a payment with 
documentation, see Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(2)(vii). In the absence of 
documentation, see Sec. Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3) and 1.6049-5(d) and 
paragraphs (d) and (e)(6) of this section for applicable presumptions.
    (iv) Examples. The rules of paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (ii) of this 
section are illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. FP is a nonwithholding foreign partnership organized in 
Country X. FP has two partners, FC, a foreign corporation, and USP, a 
U.S. partnership. USWH, a U.S. withholding agent, makes a payment of 
U.S. source interest to FP. FP has provided USWH with a valid 
nonwithholding foreign partnership certificate, as described in 
paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section, with which it associates a 
beneficial owner withholding certificate from FC and a Form W-9 from USP 
together with the withholding statement required by paragraph (c)(3)(iv) 
of this section. USWH can reliably associate the payment of interest 
with the withholding certificates from FC and USP. Under paragraph 
(c)(1)(i) of this section, the payees of the interest payment are FC and 
USP.
    Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that FP1, 
a nonwithholding foreign partnership, is a partner in FP rather than 
USP. FP1 has two partners, A and B, both foreign persons. FP provides 
USWH with a valid nonwithholding foreign partnership certificate, as 
described in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section, with which it 
associates a beneficial owner withholding certificate from FC and a 
nonwithholding foreign partnership certificate from FP1. In addition, 
foreign beneficial owner withholding certificates from A and B are 
associated with the nonwithholding foreign partnership withholding 
certificate from FP1. FP also provides the withholding statement 
required by paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section. USWH can reliably 
associate the interest payment

[[Page 129]]

with the withholding certificates provided by FC, A, and B. Therefore, 
under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the payees of the interest 
payment are FC, A, and B.
    Example 3. USWH makes a payment of U.S. source dividends to WFP, a 
withholding foreign partnership. WFP has two partners, FC1 and FC2, both 
foreign corporations. USWH can reliably associate the payment with a 
valid withholding foreign partnership withholding certificate from WFP. 
Therefore, under paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, WFP is the 
payee of the dividends.
    Example 4. USWH makes a payment of U.S. source royalties to FP, a 
foreign partnership. USWH can reliably associate the royalties with a 
valid withholding certificate from FP on which FP certifies that the 
income is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business 
in the United States. Therefore, under paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B) of this 
section, FP is the payee of the royalties.

    (2) Withholding foreign partnerships--(i) Reliance on claim of 
withholding foreign partnership status. A withholding foreign 
partnership is a foreign partnership that has entered into an agreement 
with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), as described in paragraph 
(c)(2)(ii) of this section, with respect to distributions and guaranteed 
payments it makes to its partners. A withholding agent that can reliably 
associate a payment with a certificate described in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) 
of this section may treat the person to whom it makes the payment as a 
withholding foreign partnership for purposes of withholding under 
chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code, information reporting under 
chapter 61 of the Internal Revenue Code, backup withholding under 
section 3406, and withholding under other provisions of the Internal 
Revenue Code. Furnishing such a certificate is in lieu of transmitting 
to a withholding agent withholding certificates or other appropriate 
documentation for its partners. Although the withholding foreign 
partnership generally will be required to obtain withholding 
certificates or other appropriate documentation from its partners 
pursuant to its agreement with the IRS, it will generally not be 
required to attach such documentation to its withholding foreign 
partnership withholding certificate. A foreign partnership may act as a 
qualified intermediary under Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(5) with respect to 
payments it makes to persons other than its partners. In addition, the 
IRS may permit a foreign partnership to act as a qualified intermediary 
under Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(5)(ii)(D) with respect to its partners in 
appropriate circumstances.
    (ii) Withholding agreement. The IRS may, upon request, enter into a 
withholding agreement with a foreign partnership pursuant to such 
procedures as the IRS may prescribe in published guidance (see Sec. 
601.601(d)(2) of this chapter). Under the withholding agreement, a 
foreign partnership shall generally be subject to the applicable 
withholding and reporting provisions applicable to withholding agents 
and payors under chapters 3 and 61 of the Internal Revenue Code, section 
3406, the regulations under those provisions, and other withholding 
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, except to the extent provided 
under the agreement. Under the agreement, a foreign partnership may 
agree to act as an acceptance agent to perform the duties described in 
Sec. 301.6109-1(d)(3)(iv)(A) of this chapter. The agreement may specify 
the manner in which applicable procedures for adjustments for 
underwithholding and overwithholding, including refund procedures, apply 
to the withholding foreign partnership and its partners and the extent 
to which applicable procedures may be modified. In particular, a 
withholding agreement may allow a withholding foreign partnership to 
claim refunds of overwithheld amounts on behalf of its customers. In 
addition, the agreement must specify the manner in which the IRS will 
audit the foreign partnership's books and records in order to verify the 
partnership's compliance with its agreement. A withholding foreign 
partnership must file a return on Form 1042 and information returns on 
Form 1042-S. The withholding foreign partnership agreement may also 
require a withholding foreign partnership to file a partnership return 
under section 6031(a) and partner statements under 6031(b).
    (iii) Withholding responsibility. A withholding foreign partnership 
must assume primary withholding responsibility under chapter 3 of the 
Internal Revenue Code. It is not required to provide information to the 
withholding agent regarding each partner's distributive share of the 
payment. The

[[Page 130]]

withholding foreign partnership will be responsible for reporting the 
payments under Sec. 1.1461-1(c) and chapter 61 of the Internal Revenue 
Code. A withholding agent making a payment to a withholding foreign 
partnership is not required to withhold any amount under chapter 3 of 
the Internal Revenue Code on a payment to the withholding foreign 
partnership, unless it has actual knowledge or reason to know that the 
foreign partnership is not a withholding foreign partnership. The 
withholding foreign partnership shall withhold the payments under the 
same procedures and at the same time as prescribed for withholding by a 
U.S. partnership under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, except that, 
for purposes of determining the partner's status, the provisions of 
paragraph (d)(4) of this section shall apply.
    (iv) Withholding certificate from a withholding foreign partnership. 
The rules of Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(4) shall apply to withholding 
certificates described in this paragraph (c)(2)(iv). A withholding 
certificate furnished by a withholding foreign partnership is valid with 
regard to any partner on whose behalf the certificate is furnished only 
if it is furnished on a Form W-8, an acceptable substitute form, or such 
other form as the IRS may prescribe, it is signed under penalties of 
perjury by a partner with authority to sign for the partnership, its 
validity has not expired, and it contains the information, statement, 
and certifications described in this paragraph (c)(2)(iv) as follows--
    (A) The name, permanent residence address (as described in Sec. 
1.1441-1(e)(2)(ii)), and the employer identification number of the 
partnership, and the country under the laws of which the partnership is 
created or governed;
    (B) A certification that the partnership is a withholding foreign 
partnership within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section; 
and
    (C) Any other information, certifications or statements as may be 
required by the withholding foreign partnership agreement with the IRS 
or the form or accompanying instructions in addition to, or in lieu of, 
the information, statements, and certifications described in this 
paragraph (c)(2)(iv).
    (3) Nonwithholding foreign partnerships--(i) Reliance on claim of 
foreign partnership status. A withholding agent may treat a person as a 
nonwithholding foreign partnership if it receives from that person a 
nonwithholding foreign partnership withholding certificate as described 
in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section. A withholding agent that does 
not receive a nonwithholding foreign partnership withholding 
certificate, or does not receive a valid withholding certificate, from 
an entity it knows, or has reason to know, is a foreign partnership, 
must apply the presumption rules of Sec. Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3) and 
1.6049-5(d) and paragraphs (d) and (e)(6) of this section. In addition, 
to the extent a withholding agent cannot, prior to a payment, reliably 
associate the payment with valid documentation from a payee that is 
associated with the nonwithholding foreign partnership withholding 
certificate or has insufficient information to report the payment on 
Form 1042-S or Form 1099, to the extent reporting is required, must also 
apply the presumption rules. See Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(2)(vii)(A) and (B) 
for rules regarding reliable association. See paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of 
this section and Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iv) for alternative procedures 
permitting allocation information to be received after a payment is 
made.
    (ii) Reliance on claim of reduced withholding by a partnership for 
its partners. This paragraph (c)(3)(ii) describes the manner in which a 
withholding agent may rely on a claim of reduced withholding when making 
a payment to a nonwithholding foreign partnership. To the extent that a 
withholding agent treats a payment to a nonwithholding foreign 
partnership as a payment to the nonwithholding foreign partnership's 
partners (whether direct or indirect) in accordance with paragraph 
(c)(1)(i) of this section, it may rely on a claim for reduced 
withholding by the partner if, prior to the payment, the withholding 
agent can reliably associate the payment (within the meaning of Sec. 
1.1441-1(b)(2)(vii)) with a valid withholding certificate or other 
appropriate documentation from the partner that establishes entitlement 
to a reduced

[[Page 131]]

rate of withholding. A withholding certificate or other appropriate 
documentation that establishes entitlement to a reduced rate of 
withholding is a beneficial owner withholding certificate described in 
Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(2)(i), documentary evidence described in Sec. 1.1441-
6(c)(3) or (4) or 1.6049-5(c)(1) (for a partner claiming to be a foreign 
person and a beneficial owner, determined under the provisions of Sec. 
1.1441-1(c)(6)), a Form W-9 described in Sec. 1.1441-1(d) (for a 
partner claiming to be a U.S. payee), or a withholding foreign 
partnership withholding certificate described in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of 
this section. Unless a nonwithholding foreign partnership withholding 
certificate is provided for income claimed to be effectively connected 
with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, a claim 
must be presented for each portion of the payment that represents an 
item of income includible in the distributive share of a partner as 
required under paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(C) of this section. When making a 
claim for several partners, the partnership may present a single 
nonwithholding foreign partnership withholding certificate to which the 
partners' certificates or other appropriate documentation are 
associated. Where the nonwithholding foreign partnership withholding 
certificate is provided for income claimed to be effectively connected 
with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States under 
paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(D) of this section, the claim may be presented 
without having to identify any partner's distributive share of the 
payment.
    (iii) Withholding certificate from a nonwithholding foreign 
partnership. A nonwithholding foreign partnership shall provide a 
nonwithholding foreign partnership withholding certificate with respect 
to reportable amounts received by the nonwithholding foreign 
partnership. A nonwithholding foreign partnership withholding 
certificate is valid only to the extent it is furnished on a Form W-8 
(or an acceptable substitute form or such other form as the IRS may 
prescribe), it is signed under penalties of perjury by a partner with 
authority to sign for the partnership, its validity has not expired, and 
it contains the information, statements, and certifications described in 
this paragraph (c)(3)(iii) and paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section, and 
the withholding certificates and other appropriate documentation for all 
the persons to whom the certificate relates are associated with the 
certificate. The rules of Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(4) shall apply to 
withholding certificates described in this paragraph (c)(3)(iii). No 
withholding certificates or other appropriate documentation from persons 
who derive income through a partnership (whether or not U.S. exempt 
recipients) are required to be associated with the nonwithholding 
foreign partnership withholding certificate if the certificate is 
furnished solely for income claimed to be effectively connected with the 
conduct of a trade or business in the United States. Withholding 
certificates and other appropriate documentation that may be associated 
with the nonwithholding foreign partnership withholding certificate 
consist of beneficial owner withholding certificates under Sec. 1.1441-
1(e)(2)(i), intermediary withholding certificates under Sec. 1.1441-
1(e)(3)(i), withholding foreign partnership withholding certificates 
under paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section, nonwithholding foreign 
partnership withholding certificates under this paragraph (c)(3)(iii), 
withholding certificates from foreign trusts or estates under paragraph 
(e) of this section, documentary evidence described in Sec. 1.1441-
6(c)(3) or (4) or documentary evidence described in Sec. 1.6049-
5(c)(1), and any other documentation or certificates applicable under 
other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code or regulations that 
certify or establish the status of the payee or beneficial owner as a 
U.S. or a foreign person. Nothing in this paragraph (c)(3)(iii) shall 
require a nonwithholding foreign partnership to furnish original 
documentation. Copies of certificates or documentary evidence may be 
transmitted to the U.S. withholding agent, in which case the 
nonwithholding foreign partnership must retain the original 
documentation for the same time period that the copy is required to be 
retained by the withholding agent under Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(4)(iii) and 
must provide it to the withholding agent upon request. The information, 
statement,

[[Page 132]]

and certifications required on the withholding certificate are as 
follows--
    (A) The name, permanent residence address (as described in Sec. 
1.1441-1(e)(2)(ii)), and the employer identification number of the 
partnership, if any, and the country under the laws of which the 
partnership is created or governed;
    (B) A certification that the person whose name is on the certificate 
is a foreign partnership;
    (C) A withholding statement associated with the nonwithholding 
foreign partnership withholding certificate that provides all of the 
information required by paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section and Sec. 
1.1441-1(e)(3)(iv). No withholding statement is required, however, for a 
nonwithholding foreign partnership withholding certificate furnished for 
income claimed to be effectively connected with the conduct of a trade 
or business in the United States;
    (D) A certification that the income is effectively connected with 
the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, if applicable; 
and
    (E) Any other information, certifications, or statements required by 
the form or accompanying instructions in addition to, or in lieu of, the 
information and certifications described in this paragraph (c)(3)(iii).
    (iv) Withholding statement provided by nonwithholding foreign 
partnership. The provisions of Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iv) (regarding a 
withholding statement) shall apply to a nonwithholding foreign 
partnership by substituting the term nonwithholding foreign partnership 
for the term nonqualified intermediary.
    (v) Withholding and reporting by a foreign partnership. A 
nonwithholding foreign partnership described in this paragraph (c)(3) 
that receives an amount subject to withholding (as defined in Sec. 
1.1441-2(a)) shall be required to withhold and report such payment under 
chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder 
except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c)(3)(v). A 
nonwithholding foreign partnership shall not be required to withhold and 
report if it has provided a valid nonwithholding foreign partnership 
withholding certificate, it has provided all of the information required 
by paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section (withholding statement), and it 
does not know, and has no reason to know, that another withholding agent 
failed to withhold the correct amount or failed to report the payment 
correctly under Sec. 1.1461-1(c). A withholding foreign partnership's 
obligations to withhold and report shall be determined in accordance 
with its withholding foreign partnership agreement.
    (d) Presumption rules--(1) In general. This paragraph (d) contains 
the applicable presumptions for a withholding agent (including a 
partnership) to determine the classification and status of a partnership 
and its partners in the absence of documentation. The provisions of 
Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iv) (regarding the 90-day grace period) and Sec. 
1.1441-1(b)(3)(vii) through (ix) shall apply for purposes of this 
paragraph (d).
    (2) Determination of partnership status as U.S. or foreign in the 
absence of documentation. In the absence of a valid representation of 
U.S. partnership status in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section or of foreign partnership status in accordance with paragraph 
(c)(2)(i) or (3)(i) of this section, the withholding agent shall 
determine the classification of the payee under the presumptions set 
forth in Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(ii). If the withholding agent treats the 
payee as a partnership under Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(ii), the withholding 
agent shall presume the partnership to be a U.S. partnership unless 
there are indicia of foreign status. If there are indicia of foreign 
status, the withholding agent may presume the partnership to be foreign. 
Indicia of foreign status exist only if the withholding agent has actual 
knowledge of the payee's employer identification number and that number 
begins with the two digits ``98,'' the withholding agent's 
communications with the payee are mailed to an address in a foreign 
country, or the payment is made outside the United States (as defined in 
Sec. 1.6049-5(e)). For rules regarding reliable association with a 
withholding certificate from a domestic or a foreign partnership, see 
Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(2)(vii).
    (3) Determination of partners' status in the absence of certain 
documentation. If a nonwithholding foreign partnership has provided a 
nonwithholding foreign

[[Page 133]]

partnership withholding certificate under paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this 
section that would be valid except that the withholding agent cannot 
reliably associate all or a portion of the payment with valid 
documentation from a partner of the partnership, then the withholding 
agent may apply the presumption rule of this paragraph (d)(3) with 
respect to all or a portion of the payment for which documentation has 
not been received. See Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(2)(vii)(A) and (B) for rules 
regarding reliable association. The presumption rule of this paragraph 
(d)(3) also applies to a person that is presumed to be a foreign 
partnership under the rule of paragraph (d)(2) of this section. Any 
portion of a payment that the withholding agent cannot treat as reliably 
associated with valid documentation from a partner may be presumed made 
to a foreign payee. As a result, any payment of an amount subject to 
withholding is subject to withholding at a rate of 30 percent. Any 
payment that is presumed to be made to an undocumented foreign payee 
must be reported on Form 1042-S. See Sec. 1.1461-1(c).
    (4) Determination by a withholding foreign partnership of the status 
of its partners. A withholding foreign partnership shall determine 
whether the partners or some other persons are the payees of the 
partners' distributive shares of any payment made by a withholding 
foreign partnership by applying the rules of Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(2), 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section (in the case of a partner that is a 
foreign partnership), and paragraph (e)(3) of this section (in the case 
of a partner that is a foreign estate or a foreign trust). Further, the 
provisions of paragraph (d)(3) of this section shall apply to determine 
the status of partners and the applicable withholding rates to the 
extent that, at the time the foreign partnership is required to withhold 
on a payment, it cannot reliably associate the amount with documentation 
for any one or more of its partners.
    (e) Foreign trusts and estates--(1) In general. This paragraph (e) 
provides rules applicable to payments of amounts subject to withholding 
(as defined in Sec. 1.1441-2(a)) that a withholding agent may treat as 
made to any foreign trust or a foreign estate. For rules relating to 
payments to a U.S. trust or a U.S. estate, see paragraph (b) of this 
section. For the definitions of foreign simple trust, foreign complex 
trust, and foreign grantor trust, see Sec. 1.1441-1(c)(24), (25), and 
(26).
    (2) Payments to foreign complex trusts and foreign estates. Under 
Sec. 1.1441-1(c)(6)(ii)(D), a foreign complex trust or foreign estate 
is generally considered to be the beneficial owner of income paid to the 
foreign complex trust or foreign estate. See paragraph (e)(4) of this 
section for rules describing when a withholding agent may treat a 
payment as made to a foreign complex trust or a foreign estate.
    (3) Payees of payments to foreign simple trusts and foreign grantor 
trusts--(i) Payments for which beneficiaries and owners are payees. For 
purposes of the regulations under chapters 3 and 61 of the Internal 
Revenue Code and section 3406, a foreign simple trust is not a 
beneficial owner or a payee of a payment. Also, a foreign grantor trust 
(or a portion of a trust that is a foreign grantor trust) is not 
considered a beneficial owner or a payee of a payment. Except as 
otherwise provided in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, the payees 
of a payment made to a person that the withholding agent may treat as a 
foreign simple trust or a foreign grantor trust (or a portion of a trust 
that is a foreign grantor trust) are determined under the rules of this 
paragraph (e)(3)(i). The payees shall be treated as the beneficial 
owners if they may be so treated under Sec. 1.1441-1(c)(6)(ii)(C) and 
they provide documentation supporting their status as the beneficial 
owners. The payees of a payment to a foreign simple trust or foreign 
grantor trust are determined as follows--
    (A) If the withholding agent can reliably associate a payment with a 
valid Form W-9 provided under Sec. 1.1441-1(d) from a beneficiary or 
owner of the foreign trust, then the beneficiary or owner is a U.S. 
payee;
    (B) If the withholding agent can reliably associate a payment with a 
valid Form W-8, or other appropriate documentation, provided under Sec. 
1.1441-1(e)(1)(ii) from a beneficiary or owner of the foreign trust, 
then the beneficiary or owner is a payee that is a foreign beneficial 
owner;

[[Page 134]]

    (C) If the withholding agent can reliably associate a payment with a 
qualified intermediary withholding certificate under Sec. 1.1441-
1(e)(3)(ii), a nonqualified intermediary withholding certificate under 
Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(3)(ii), or a U.S. branch withholding certificate under 
Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(3)(v), then the rules of Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(2)(v) shall 
apply to determine the payee in the same manner as if the payment had 
been paid directly to such intermediary or U.S. branch;
    (D) If the withholding agent can reliably associate a payment with a 
withholding foreign partnership withholding certificate under paragraph 
(c)(2)(iv) of this section or a nonwithholding foreign partnership 
withholding certificate under paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section, 
then the rules of paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section shall 
apply to determine the payee;
    (E) If the withholding agent can reliably associate the payment with 
a foreign simple trust withholding certificate or a foreign grantor 
trust withholding certificate (both described in paragraph (e)(5)(iii) 
of this section) from a second or higher-tier foreign simple trust or 
foreign grantor trust, then the rules of this paragraph (e)(3)(i) or 
paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section shall apply to determine whether 
the payment is treated as made to a beneficiary or owner of the higher-
tier trust or to the trust itself in the same manner as if the payment 
had been made directly to the higher-tier trust; and
    (F) If the withholding agent cannot reliably associate a payment 
with a withholding certificate or other appropriate documentation, the 
payees shall be determined by applying the presumptions described in 
paragraph (e)(6) of this section.
    (ii) Payments for which trust is payee. A payment to a person that 
the withholding agent may treat as made to a foreign trust under 
paragraph (e)(5)(iii) of this section is treated as a payment to the 
trust, and not to a beneficiary of the trust, only if--
    (A) The withholding agent can reliably associate the payment with a 
foreign complex trust withholding certificate under paragraph (e)(4) of 
this section;
    (B) The withholding agent can reliably associate the payment with a 
foreign simple trust withholding certificate under paragraph (e)(5)(iii) 
of this section certifying that the payment is income that is treated as 
effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the 
United States; or
    (C) The withholding agent can treat the income as effectively 
connected income under the presumption rules of Sec. 1.1441-4(a)(3)(i).
    (4) Reliance on claim of foreign complex trust or foreign estate 
status. A withholding agent may treat a payment as made to a foreign 
complex trust or a foreign estate if the withholding agent can reliably 
associate the payment with a beneficial owner withholding certificate 
described in Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(2)(i) or other documentary evidence under 
Sec. 1.1441-6(c)(3) or (4) (regarding a claim for treaty benefits) or 
Sec. 1.6049-5(c)(1) (regarding documentary evidence to establish 
foreign status for purposes of chapter 61 of the Internal Revenue Code) 
that establishes the foreign complex trust or foreign estate's status as 
a beneficial owner. See paragraph (e)(6) of this section for presumption 
rules if documentation is lacking.
    (5) Foreign simple trust and foreign grantor trust--(i) Reliance on 
claim of foreign simple trust or foreign grantor trust status. A 
withholding agent may treat a person as a foreign simple trust or 
foreign grantor trust if it receives from that person a foreign simple 
trust or foreign grantor trust withholding certificate as described in 
paragraph (e)(5)(iii) of this section. A withholding agent must apply 
the presumption rules of Sec. Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3) and 1.6049-5(d) and 
paragraphs (d) and (e)(6) of this section to the extent it cannot, prior 
to the payment, reliably associate a payment (within the meaning of 
Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(2)(vii)) with a valid foreign simple trust or foreign 
grantor trust withholding certificate, it cannot reliably determine how 
much of the payment relates to valid documentation provided by a payee 
(e.g., a person that is not itself a nonqualified intermediary, flow-
through entity, or U.S. branch) associated with the foreign simple trust 
or foreign grantor trust withholding certificate, or it does not have 
sufficient information to report the

[[Page 135]]

payment on Form 1042-S or Form 1099, if reporting is required. See Sec. 
1.1441-1(b)(2)(vii)(A) and (B).
    (ii) Reliance on claim of reduced withholding by a foreign simple 
trust or foreign grantor trust for its beneficiaries or owners. This 
paragraph (e)(5)(ii) describes the manner in which a withholding agent 
may rely on a claim of reduced withholding when making a payment to a 
foreign simple trust or foreign grantor trust. To the extent that a 
withholding agent treats a payment to a foreign simple trust or foreign 
grantor trust as a payment to payees other than the trust in accordance 
with paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, it may rely on a claim for 
reduced withholding by a beneficiary or owner if, prior to the payment, 
the withholding agent can reliably associate the payment (within the 
meaning of Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(2)(vii)) with a valid withholding 
certificate or other appropriate documentation from a payee or 
beneficial owner that establishes entitlement to a reduced rate of 
withholding. A withholding certificate or other appropriate 
documentation that establishes entitlement to a reduced rate of 
withholding is a beneficial owner withholding certificate described in 
Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(2)(i) or documentary evidence described in Sec. 
1.1441-6(c)(3) or(4) or in Sec. 1.6049-5(c)(1) (for a beneficiary or 
owner claiming to be a foreign person and a beneficial owner, determined 
under the provisions of Sec. 1.1441-1(c)(6)), a Form W-9 described in 
Sec. 1.1441-1(d) (for a beneficiary or owner claiming to be a U.S. 
payee), or a withholding foreign partnership withholding certificate 
described in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section. Unless a foreign 
simple trust or foreign grantor trust withholding certificate is 
provided for income treated as income effectively connected with the 
conduct of a trade or business in the United States, a claim must be 
presented for each payee's portion of the payment. When making a claim 
for several payees, the trust may present a single foreign simple trust 
or foreign grantor trust withholding certificate with which the payees' 
certificates or other appropriate documentation are associated. Where 
the foreign simple trust or foreign grantor trust withholding 
certificate is provided for income that is treated as effectively 
connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States 
under paragraph (e)(5)(iii)(D) of this section, the claim may be 
presented without having to identify any beneficiary's or grantor's 
distributive share of the payment.
    (iii) Withholding certificate from foreign simple trust or foreign 
grantor trust. A withholding certificate furnished by a foreign simple 
trust or a foreign grantor trust that is not a withholding foreign trust 
(within the meaning of paragraph (e)(5)(v) of this section) is valid 
only if it is furnished on a Form W-8, an acceptable substitute form, or 
such other form as the IRS may prescribe, it is signed under penalties 
of perjury by a trustee, its validity has not expired, it contains the 
information, statements, and certifications required by this paragraph 
(e)(5)(iii) and Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iv), and the withholding 
certificates or other appropriate documentation for all of the payees 
(as determined under paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section) to whom the 
certificate relates are associated with the foreign simple trust or 
foreign grantor trust withholding certificate. The rules of Sec. 
1.1441-1(e)(4) shall apply to withholding certificates described in this 
paragraph (e)(5)(iii). No withholding certificates or other appropriate 
documentation from persons who derive income through a foreign simple 
trust or a foreign grantor trust (whether or not U.S. exempt recipients) 
are required to be associated with the foreign simple trust or foreign 
grantor trust withholding certificate if the certificate is furnished 
solely for income that is treated as effectively connected with the 
conduct of a trade or business in the United States. Withholding 
certificates and other appropriate documentation (as determined under 
paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section) that may be associated with a 
foreign simple trust or foreign grantor trust withholding certificate 
consist of beneficial owner withholding certificates under Sec. 1.1441-
1(e)(2)(i), intermediary withholding certificates under Sec. 1.1441-
1(e)(3)(i), withholding foreign partnership withholding certificates 
under paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section, nonwithholding foreign 
partnership

[[Page 136]]

withholding certificates under paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section, 
withholding certificates from foreign trusts or estates under paragraph 
(e)(4) or (5)(iii) of this section, documentary evidence described in 
Sec. Sec. 1.1441-6(c)(3) or (4), or 1.6049-5(c)(1), and any other 
documentation or certificates applicable under other provisions of the 
Internal Revenue Code or regulations that certify or establish the 
status of the payee or beneficial owner as a U.S. or a foreign person. 
Nothing in this paragraph (e)(5)(iii) shall require a foreign simple 
trust or foreign grantor trust to provide original documentation. Copies 
of certificates or documentary evidence may be passed up to the U.S. 
withholding agent, in which case the foreign simple trust or foreign 
grantor trust must retain the original documentation for the same time 
period that the copy is required to be retained by the withholding agent 
under Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(4)(iii) and must provide it to the withholding 
agent upon request. The information, statement, and certifications 
required on a foreign simple trust or foreign grantor trust withholding 
certificate are as follows--
    (A) The name, permanent residence address (as described in Sec. 
1.1441-1(e)(2)(ii)), and the employer identification number, if 
required, of the trust and the country under the laws of which the trust 
is created;
    (B) A certification that the person whose name is on the certificate 
is a foreign simple trust or a foreign grantor trust;
    (C) A withholding statement associated with the foreign simple trust 
or foreign grantor trust withholding certificate that provides all of 
the information required by paragraph (e)(5)(iv) of this section. No 
withholding statement is required, however, for a foreign simple trust 
withholding certificate furnished for income that is treated as 
effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the 
United States;
    (D) A certification on a foreign simple trust withholding 
certificate that the income is treated as effectively connected with the 
conduct of a trade or business in the United States, if applicable; and
    (E) Any other information, certifications, or statements required by 
the form or accompanying instructions in addition to, or in lieu of, the 
information, certifications, and statements described in this paragraph 
(e)(5)(iii);
    (iv) Withholding statement provided by a foreign simple trust or 
foreign grantor trust. The provisions of Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iv) 
(regarding a withholding statement) shall apply to a foreign simple 
trust or foreign grantor trust by substituting the term foreign simple 
trust or foreign grantor trust for the term nonqualified intermediary.
    (v) Withholding foreign trusts. The IRS may enter an agreement with 
a foreign trust to treat the trust or estate as a withholding foreign 
trust. Such an agreement shall generally follow the same principles as 
an agreement with a withholding foreign partnership under paragraph 
(c)(2)(ii) of this section. A withholding agent may treat a payment to a 
withholding foreign trust in the same manner the withholding agent would 
treat a payment to a withholding foreign partnership. The IRS may also 
enter an agreement to treat a trust as a qualified intermediary in 
appropriate circumstances. See Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(5)(ii)(D).
    (6) Presumption rules--(i) In general. This paragraph (e)(6) 
contains the applicable presumptions for a withholding agent (including 
a trust or estate) to determine the classification and status of a trust 
or estate and its beneficiaries or owners in the absence of valid 
documentation. The provisions of Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iv) (regarding the 
90-day grace period) and Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(vii) through (ix) shall 
apply for purposes of this paragraph (e)(6).
    (ii) Determination of status as U.S. or foreign trust or estate in 
the absence of documentation. In the absence of valid documentation that 
establishes the U.S. status of a trust or estate under paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section and of documentation that establishes the foreign status 
of a trust or estate under paragraph (e)(4) or (5)(iii) of this section, 
the withholding agent shall determine the classification of the payee 
based upon the presumptions set forth in Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(ii). If, 
based upon those presumptions, the withholding agent classifies the 
payee as a trust or

[[Page 137]]

estate, the trust or estate shall be presumed to be a U.S. trust or U.S. 
estate unless there are indicia of foreign status, in which case the 
trust or estate shall be presumed to be foreign. Indicia of foreign 
status exists if the withholding agent has actual knowledge of the 
payee's employer identification number and that number begins with the 
two digits ``98,'' the withholding agent's communications with the payee 
are mailed to an address in a foreign country, or the payment is made 
outside the United States (as defined in Sec. 1.6049-5(e)). If an 
undocumented payee is presumed to be a foreign trust it shall be 
presumed to be a foreign complex trust. If a withholding agent has 
documentary evidence that establishes that an entity is a foreign trust, 
but the withholding agent cannot determine whether the foreign trust is 
a complex trust, a simple trust, or foreign grantor trust, the 
withholding agent may presume that the trust is a foreign complex trust.
    (iii) Determination of beneficiary or owner's status in the absence 
of certain documentation. If a foreign simple trust or foreign grantor 
trust has provided a foreign simple trust or foreign grantor trust 
withholding certificate under paragraph (e)(5)(iii) of this section but 
the payment to such trust cannot be reliably associated with valid 
documentation from a specific beneficiary or owner of the trust, then 
any portion of a payment that a withholding agent cannot treat as 
reliably associated with valid documentation from a beneficiary or owner 
may be presumed made to a foreign payee. As a result, any payment of an 
amount subject to withholding is subject to withholding at a rate of 30 
percent. Any such payment that is presumed to be made to an undocumented 
foreign person must be reported on Form 1042-S. See Sec. 1.1461-1(c).
    (f) Failure to receive withholding certificate timely or to act in 
accordance with applicable presumptions. See applicable procedures 
described in Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(7) in the event the withholding agent 
does not hold an appropriate withholding certificate or other 
appropriate documentation at the time of payment or fails to rely on the 
presumptions set forth in Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3) or in paragraph (d) or 
(e) of this section.
    (g) Effective date--(1) General rule. This section applies to 
payments made after December 31, 2000.
    (2) Transition rules. The validity of a withholding certificate that 
was valid on January 1, 1998, under the regulations in effect prior to 
January 1, 2001 (see 26 CFR parts 1 and 35a, revised April 1, 1999) and 
expired, or will expire, at any time during 1998, is extended until 
December 31, 1998. The validity of a withholding certificate that is 
valid on or after January 1, 1999, remains valid until its validity 
expires under the regulations in effect prior to January 1, 2001 (see 26 
CFR parts 1 and 35a, revised April 1, 1999) but in no event will such a 
withholding certificate remain valid after December 31, 2000. The rule 
in this paragraph (g)(2), however, does not apply to extend the validity 
period of a withholding certificate that expires solely by reason of 
changes in the circumstances of the person whose name is on the 
certificate. Notwithstanding the first three sentences of this paragraph 
(g)(2), a withholding agent may choose to not take advantage of the 
transition rule in this paragraph (g)(2) with respect to one or more 
withholding certificates valid under the regulations in effect prior to 
January 1, 2001 (see 26 CFR parts 1 and 35a, revised April 1, 1999) and, 
therefore, to require withholding certificates conforming to the 
requirements described in this section (new withholding certificates). 
For purposes of this section, a new withholding certificate is deemed to 
satisfy the documentation requirement under the regulations in effect 
prior to January 1, 2001 (see 26 CFR parts 1 and 35a, revised April 1, 
1999). Further, a new withholding certificate remains valid for the 
period specified in Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(4)(ii), regardless of when the 
certificate is obtained.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1441-6  Claim of reduced withholding under an income tax treaty.

    (a) In general. The rate of withholding on a payment of income 
subject to withholding may be reduced to the extent provided under an 
income tax treaty in effect between the United States and a foreign 
country. Most benefits under income tax treaties are to foreign persons 
who reside in the treaty country. In some cases, benefits are available 
under an income tax treaty to U.S. citizens or U.S. residents or to 
residents of a third country.
    See paragraph (b)(5) of this section for claims of benefits by U.S. 
persons. If the requirements of this section are met, the amount 
withheld from the payment may be reduced at source to account for the 
treaty benefit. See also Sec. 1.1441-4(b)(2) for rules regarding claims 
of reduced rate of withholding under an income tax treaty in the case of 
compensation from personal services.
    (b) Reliance on claim of reduced withholding under an income tax 
treaty--(1) In general. The withholding imposed under section 1441, 
1442, or 1443 on any payment to a foreign person is eligible for 
reduction under the terms of an income tax treaty only to the extent 
that such payment is treated as derived by a resident of an applicable 
treaty jurisdiction, such resident is a beneficial owner, and all other 
requirements for benefits under the treaty are satisfied. See section 
894 and the regulations thereunder to determine whether a resident of a 
treaty country derives the income. Absent actual knowledge or reason to 
know otherwise, a withholding agent may rely on a claim that a 
beneficial owner is entitled to a reduced rate of withholding based upon 
an income tax treaty if, prior to the payment, the withholding agent can 
reliably associate the payment with a beneficial owner withholding 
certificate, described in Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(2), that contains the 
information necessary to support the claim, or, in the case of a payment 
of income described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section made outside the 
United States with respect to an offshore account, documentary evidence 
described in paragraphs (c)(3), (4) and (5) of this section. See 
Sec. Sec. 1.6049-5(e) for the definition of payments made outside the 
United States and 1.6049-5(c)(1) for the definition of offshore account. 
For purposes of this paragraph (b)(1), a beneficial owner withholding 
certificate described in Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(2)(i) contains information 
necessary to support the claim for a treaty benefit only if it includes 
the beneficial owner's taxpayer identifying number (except as otherwise 
provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section and Sec. 1.1441-6(g)) and 
the representations that the beneficial owner derives the income under 
section 894 and the regulations thereunder, if required, and meets the 
limitation on benefits provisions of the treaty, if any. The withholding 
certificate must also contain any other representations required by this 
section and any other information, certifications, or statements as may 
be required by the form or accompanying instructions in addition to, or 
in place of, the information and certifications described in this 
section. Absent actual knowledge or reason to know that the claims are 
incorrect (and subject to the standards of knowledge in Sec. 1.1441-
7(b)), a withholding agent may rely on the claims made on a withholding 
certificate or on documentary evidence. A withholding agent may also 
rely on the information contained in a withholding statement provided 
under Sec. Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iv) and 1.1441-5(c)(3)(iv) and 
(e)(5)(iv) to determine whether the appropriate statements regarding 
section 894 and limitation on benefits have been provided in connection 
with documentary evidence. If the beneficial owner is a person related 
to the withholding agent within the meaning of section 482, the 
withholding certificate must also contain a representation that the 
beneficial owner will file the statement required under Sec. 301.6114-
1(d) of this chapter (if applicable). The requirement to file an 
information statement under section 6114 for income subject to 
withholding applies only to amounts received during the calendar year 
that, in the aggregate, exceed $500,000. See Sec. 301.6114-1(d) of this 
chapter. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may apply the provisions of 
Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(1)(ii)(B) to notify the withholding agent that the 
certificate cannot be relied upon to grant benefits under an income tax 
treaty. See Sec. 1.1441-

[[Page 139]]

1(e)(4)(viii) regarding reliance on a withholding certificate by a 
withholding agent. The provisions of Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iv) dealing 
with a 90-day grace period shall apply for purposes of this section.
    (2) Payment to fiscally transparent entity--(i) In general. If the 
person claiming a reduced rate of withholding under an income tax treaty 
is the interest holder of an entity that is considered to be fiscally 
transparent (as defined in the regulations under section 894) by the 
interest holder's jurisdiction with respect to an item of income, then, 
with respect to such income derived by that person through the entity, 
the entity shall be treated as a flow-through entity and may provide a 
flow-through withholding certificate with which the withholding 
certificate or other documentary evidence of the interest holder that 
supports the claim for treaty benefits is associated. For purposes of 
the preceding sentence, interest holders do not include any direct or 
indirect interest holders that are themselves treated as fiscally 
transparent entities with respect to that income by the interest 
holder's jurisdiction. See Sec. 1.1441-1(c)(23) and (e)(3)(i) for the 
definition of flow-through entity and flow-through withholding 
certificate. The entity may provide a beneficial owner withholding 
certificate, or beneficial owner documentation, with respect to any 
remaining portion of the income to the extent the entity is receiving 
income and is not treated as fiscally transparent by its own 
jurisdiction. Further, the entity may claim a reduced rate of 
withholding with respect to the portion of a payment for which it is not 
treated as fiscally transparent if it meets all the requirements to make 
such a claim and, in the case of treaty benefits, it provides the 
documentation required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section. If dual 
claims, as described in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, are made, 
multiple withholding certificates may have to be furnished. Multiple 
withholding certificates may also have to be furnished if the entity 
receives income for which a reduction of withholding is claimed under a 
provision of the Internal Revenue Code (e.g., portfolio interest) and 
income for which a reduction of withholding is claimed under an income 
tax treaty.
    (ii) Certification by qualified intermediary. Notwithstanding 
paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, a foreign entity that is fiscally 
transparent, as defined in the regulations under section 894, that is 
also a qualified intermediary for purposes of claiming a reduced rate of 
withholding under an income tax treaty for its interest holders (who are 
deriving the income paid to the entity as residents of an applicable 
treaty jurisdiction) may furnish a single qualified intermediary 
withholding certificate, as described in Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(3)(ii), for 
amounts for which it claims a reduced rate of withholding under an 
income tax treaty on behalf of its interest holders.
    (iii) Dual treatment. Under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, a 
withholding agent may make a payment to a foreign entity that is 
simultaneously claiming to be the beneficial owner of a portion of the 
income (whether or not it is also claiming a reduced rate of tax on its 
own behalf) and a reduced rate on behalf of persons in their capacity as 
interest holders in the entity with respect to the same, or a different, 
portion of the income. If the same portion of a payment may be reliably 
associated with both the entity's claim and an interest holder's claim, 
the withholding agent may choose to reject both claims and request new 
documentation and information allocating the payment among the 
beneficial owners of the payment or the withholding agent may choose 
which claim to apply. If the entity and the interest holder's claims are 
reliably associated with separate portions of the payment, the 
withholding agent may, at its option, accept such dual claims based on 
withholding certificates or other appropriate documentation furnished by 
the entity and its interest holders with respect to their respective 
shares of the payment even though this will result in the withholding 
agent treating the entity differently with respect to different portions 
of the same payment. Alternatively, the withholding agent may choose to 
apply only the claim made by the entity, provided the entity may be 
treated as a beneficial owner of the income. If the withholding agent

[[Page 140]]

does not accept claims for a reduced rate of withholding presented by 
any one or more of the interest holders, or by the entity, any interest 
holder or the entity may subsequently claim a refund or credit of any 
amount so withheld to the extent the interest holder's or entity's share 
of such withholding exceeds the amount of tax due.
    (iv) Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this 
paragraph (b)(2):

    Example 1. (i) Facts. Entity E is a business organization formed 
under the laws of country Y. Country Y has an income tax treaty with the 
United States. The treaty contains a limitation on benefits provision. E 
receives U.S. source royalties from withholding agent W and claims a 
reduced rate of withholding under the U.S.-Y tax treaty on its own 
behalf (rather than on behalf of its interest holders). E furnishes a 
beneficial owner withholding certificate described in paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section that represents that E is a resident of country Y 
(within the meaning of the U.S.-Y tax treaty), is the beneficial owner 
of the income, derives the income under section 894 and the regulations 
thereunder, and is not precluded from claiming benefits by the treaty's 
limitation on benefits provision.
    (ii) Analysis. Absent actual knowledge or reason to know otherwise, 
W may rely on the representations made by E to apply a reduced rate of 
withholding.
    Example 2. (i) Facts. The facts are the same as under Example 1, 
except that one of E's interest holders, H, is an entity organized in 
country Z. The U.S.-Z tax treaty reduces the rate on royalties to zero 
whereas the rate on royalties under the U.S.-Y tax treaty applicable to 
E is 5 percent. H is not fiscally transparent under country Z's tax law 
with respect to such income. H furnishes a beneficial owner withholding 
certificate to E that represents that H derives, within the meaning of 
section 894 and the regulations thereunder, its share of the royalty 
income paid to E as a resident of country Z, is the beneficial owner of 
the royalty income, and is not precluded from claiming treaty benefits 
by virtue of the limitation on benefits provision in the U.S.-Z treaty. 
E furnishes to W a flow-through withholding certificate described in 
Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(3)(i) to which it attaches H's beneficial owner 
withholding certificate and a withholding statement for the portion of 
the payment that H claims as its distributive share of the royalty 
income. E also furnishes to W a beneficial owner withholding certificate 
for itself for the portion of the payment that H does not claim as its 
distributive share.
    (ii) Analysis. Absent actual knowledge or reason to know otherwise, 
W may rely on the documentation furnished by E to treat the royalty 
payment to a single foreign entity (E) as derived by different residents 
of tax treaty countries as a result of the claims presented under 
different treaties. W may, at its option, grant dual treatment, that is, 
a reduced rate of zero percent under the U.S.-Z treaty on the portion of 
the royalty payment that H claims to derive as a resident of country Z 
and a reduced rate of 5 percent under the U.S.-Y treaty for the balance. 
However, under paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, W may, at its 
option, treat E as the only relevant person deriving the royalty and 
grant benefits under the U.S.-Y treaty only.
    Example 3. (i) Facts. E is a business organization formed under the 
laws of country X. Country X has an income tax treaty with the United 
States. E has two interest holders, H1, organized in country Y, and H2, 
organized in country Z. E receives from W, a U.S. withholding agent, 
U.S. source royalties and interest that is eligible for the portfolio 
interest exception under sections 871(h) and 881(c), provided W receives 
the appropriate beneficial owner statement required under section 
871(h)(5). E is classified as a corporation under U.S. tax law 
principles. Country X, E's country of organization, treats E as an 
entity that is not fiscally transparent with respect to items of income 
under the regulations under section 894. Under the U.S.-X income tax 
treaty, royalties are subject to 5 percent rate of withholding. Country 
Y, H1's country of organization, treats E as fiscally transparent with 
respect to items of income under section 894 and H1 as not fiscally 
transparent with respect to items of income. Under the country Y-U.S. 
income tax treaty, royalties are exempt from U.S. tax. Country Z, H2's 
country of organization, treats E as not fiscally transparent under 
section 894 with respect to items of income. E provides W with a flow-
through beneficial owner withholding certificate with which it 
associates a beneficial owner withholding certificate from H1. H1's 
withholding certificate states that H1 is a resident of country Y, 
derives the royalty income under section 894, meets the applicable 
limitations on benefits provisions of the U.S.-Y treaty, and is the 
beneficial owner of the income. The withholding statement attached to 
E's flow-through withholding certificate allocates one-half of the 
royalty payment to H1. E also provides W with a beneficial owner 
withholding certificate for the interest income and the remaining one-
half of the royalty income. The withholding certificate states that E is 
a resident of country X, derives the royalty income under section 894, 
meets the limitation on benefits provisions of the U.S.-X treaty, and is 
the beneficial owner of the income.

    (ii) Analysis. Absent actual knowledge or reason to know that the 
claims are incorrect, W may treat one-half of the royalty derived by E 
as subject to a 5 percent withholding rate and one-half of the royalty 
as derived by H1 and subject to no withholding. Further, it may treat 
all of the interest as being paid to E and as qualifying for the 
portfolio interest exception. W can, at its option, treat the entire 
royalty as paid to E and subject it to withholding at a 5 percent rate 
of withholding. In that case, H1 would be entitled to claim a refund 
with respect to its one-half of the royalty.

    (3) Certified TIN. The IRS may issue guidance requiring a foreign 
person claiming treaty benefits and for whom a TIN is required to 
establish with the IRS, at the time the TIN is requested or after the 
TIN is issued, that the person is a resident in a treaty country and 
meets other conditions (such as limitation on benefits provisions) of 
the treaty. See Sec. 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter.
    (4) Claim of benefits under an income tax treaty by a U.S. person. 
In certain cases, a U.S. person may claim the benefit of an income tax 
treaty. For example, under certain treaties, a U.S. citizen residing in 
the treaty country may claim a reduced rate of U.S. tax on certain 
amounts representing a pension or an annuity from U.S. sources. Claims 
of treaty benefits by a U.S. person may be made by furnishing a Form W-9 
to the withholding agent or such other form as the IRS may prescribe in 
published guidance (see Sec. 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter).
    (c) Exemption from requirement to furnish a taxpayer identifying 
number and special documentary evidence rules for certain income--(1) 
General rule. In the case of income described in paragraph (c)(2) of 
this section, a withholding agent may rely on a beneficial owner 
withholding certificate described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section 
without regard to the requirement that the withholding certificate 
include the beneficial owner's taxpayer identifying number. In the case 
of payments of income described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section made 
outside the United States (as defined in Sec. 1.6049-5(e)) with respect 
to an offshore account (as defined in Sec. 1.6049-5(c)(1)), a 
withholding agent may, as an alternative to a withholding certificate 
described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, rely on a certificate of 
residence described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section or documentary 
evidence described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, relating to the 
beneficial owner, that the withholding agent has reviewed and maintains 
in its records in accordance with Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(4)(iii). In the case 
of a payment to a person other than an individual, the certificate of 
residence or documentary evidence must be accompanied by the statements 
described in paragraphs (c)(5)(i) and (ii) of this section regarding 
limitation on benefits and whether the amount paid is derived by such 
person or by one of its interest holders. The withholding agent 
maintains the reviewed documents by retaining either the documents 
viewed or a photocopy thereof and noting in its records the date on 
which, and by whom, the documents were received and reviewed. This 
paragraph (c)(1) shall not apply to amounts that are exempt from 
withholding based on a claim that the income is effectively connected 
with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States.
    (2) Income to which special rules apply. The income to which 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section applies is dividends and interest from 
stocks and debt obligations that are actively traded, dividends from any 
redeemable security issued by an investment company registered under the 
Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-1), dividends, interest, 
or royalties from units of beneficial interest in a unit investment 
trust that are (or were upon issuance) publicly offered and are 
registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the 
Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77a) and amounts paid with respect to 
loans of securities described in this paragraph (c)(2). For purposes of 
this paragraph (c)(2), a stock or debt obligation is actively traded if 
it is actively traded within the meaning of section 1092(d) and Sec. 
1.1092(d)-1 when documentation is provided.
    (3) Certificate of residence. A certificate of residence referred to 
in paragraph (c)(1) of this section is a certification issued by an 
appropriate tax official of the treaty country of which the taxpayer 
claims to be a resident

[[Page 142]]

that the taxpayer has filed its most recent income tax return as a 
resident of that country (within the meaning of the applicable tax 
treaty). The certificate of residence must have been issued by such 
official within three years prior to its being presented to the 
withholding agent, or such other period as the IRS may prescribe in 
published guidance (see Sec. 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter). See Sec. 
1.1441-1(e)(4)(ii)(A) for the period during which a withholding agent 
may rely on a certificate of residence. The competent authorities may 
agree to a different procedure for certifying residence, in which case 
such procedure shall govern for payments made to a person claiming to be 
a resident of the country with which such an agreement is in effect.
    (4) Documentary evidence establishing residence in the treaty 
country--(i) Individuals. For an individual, the documentary evidence 
referred to in paragraph (c)(1) of this section is any documentation 
that includes the individuals name, address, and photograph, is an 
official document issued by an authorized governmental body (i.e., a 
government or agency thereof, or a municipality), and has been issued no 
more than three years prior to presentation to the withholding agent. A 
document older than three years may be relied upon as proof of residence 
only if it is accompanied by additional evidence of the person's 
residence in the treaty country (e.g., a bank statement, utility bills, 
or medical bills). Documentary evidence must be in the form of original 
documents or certified copies thereof.
    (ii) Persons other than individuals. For a person other than an 
individual, the documentary evidence referred to in paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section is any documentation that includes the name of the entity 
and the address of its principal office in the treaty country, and is an 
official document issued by an authorized governmental body (e.g., a 
government or agency thereof, or a municipality).
    (5) Statements regarding entitlement to treaty benefits--(i) 
Statement regarding conditions under a limitation on benefits provision. 
In addition to the documentary evidence described in (c)(4)(ii) of this 
section, a taxpayer that is not an individual must provide a statement 
that it meets one or more of the conditions set forth in the limitation 
on benefits article (if any, or in a similar provision) contained in the 
applicable tax treaty.
    (ii) Statement regarding whether the taxpayer derives the income. A 
taxpayer that is not an individual must also provide, in addition to the 
documentary evidence and the statement described in paragraph (c)(5)(i) 
of this section, a statement that any income for which it intends to 
claim benefits under an applicable income tax treaty is income that will 
properly be treated as derived by itself as a resident of the applicable 
treaty jurisdiction within the meaning of section 894 and the 
regulations thereunder. This requirement does not apply if the taxpayer 
furnishes a certificate of residence that certifies that fact.
    (d) Joint owners. In the case of a payment to joint owners, each 
owner must furnish a withholding certificate or, if applicable, 
documentary evidence or a certificate of residence. The applicable rate 
of withholding on a payment of income to joint owners shall be the 
highest applicable rate.
    (e) Competent authority. The procedures described in this section 
may be modified to the extent the U.S. competent authority may agree 
with the competent authority of a country with which the United States 
has an income tax treaty in effect.
    (f) Failure to receive withholding certificate timely. See 
applicable procedures described in Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(7) in the event the 
withholding agent does not hold an appropriate withholding certificate 
or other appropriate documentation at the time of payment.
    (g) Special taxpayer identifying number rule for certain foreign 
individuals claiming treaty benefits--(1) General rule. Except as 
provided in paragraph (c) or (g)(2) of this section, for purposes of 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a withholding agent may not rely on a 
beneficial owner withholding certificate, described in paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section, that does not include the beneficial owner's taxpayer 
identifying number (TIN).

[[Page 143]]

    (2) Special rule. For purposes of satisfying the TIN requirement of 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a withholding agent may rely on a 
beneficial owner withholding certificate, described in such paragraph, 
without regard to the requirement that the withholding certificate 
include the beneficial owner's TIN, if--
    (i) A withholding agent, who is also an acceptance agent, as defined 
in Sec. 301.6109-1(d)(3)(iv) of this chapter (the payor), has entered 
into an acceptance agreement that permits the acceptance agent to 
request an individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN) on an 
expedited basis because of the circumstances of payment or unexpected 
nature of payments required to be made by the payor;
    (ii) The payor was required to make an unexpected payment to the 
beneficial owner who is a foreign individual;
    (iii) An ITIN for the beneficial owner cannot be received by the 
payor from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) because the IRS is not 
issuing ITINs at the time of payment or any time prior to the time of 
payment when the payor has knowledge of the unexpected payment;
    (iv) The unexpected payment to the beneficial owner could not be 
reasonably delayed to permit the payor to obtain an ITIN for the 
beneficial owner on an expedited basis; and
    (v) The payor satisfies the provisions of paragraph (g)(3) of this 
section.
    (3) Requirement that an ITIN be requested during the first business 
day following payment. The payor must submit a beneficial owner payee 
application for an ITIN (Form W-7 ``Application for IRS Individual 
Taxpayer Identification Number'') that complies with the requirements of 
Sec. 301.6109-1(d)(3)(ii) of this chapter, and also the certification 
described in Sec. 301.6109-1(d)(3)(iv)(A)(4) of this chapter, to the 
IRS during the first business day after payment is made.
    (4) Definition of unexpected payment. For purposes of this section, 
an unexpected payment is a payment that, because of the nature of the 
payment or the circumstances in which it is made, could not reasonably 
have been anticipated by the payor or beneficial owner during a time 
when the payor or beneficial owner could obtain an ITIN from the IRS. 
For purposes of this paragraph (g)(4), a payor or beneficial owner will 
not lack the requisite knowledge of the forthcoming payment solely 
because the amount of the payment is not fixed.
    (5) Examples. The rules of this paragraph (g) are illustrated by the 
following examples:

    Example 1. G, a citizen and resident of Country Y, a country with 
which the United States has an income tax treaty that exempts U.S. 
source gambling winnings from U.S. tax, is visiting the United States 
for the first time. During his visit, G visits Casino B, a casino that 
has entered into a special acceptance agent agreement with the IRS that 
permits Casino B to request an ITIN on an expedited basis. During that 
visit, on a Sunday, G wins $5000 in slot machine play at Casino B and 
requests immediate payment from Casino B. ITINs are not available from 
the IRS on Sunday and would not again be available until Monday. G, who 
does not have an individual taxpayer identification number, furnishes a 
beneficial owner withholding certificate, described in Sec. 1.1441-
1(e)(2), to the Casino upon winning at the slot machine. The beneficial 
owner withholding certificate represents that G is a resident of Country 
Y (within the meaning of the U.S.--Y tax treaty) and meets all 
applicable requirements for claiming benefits under the U.S.--Y tax 
treaty. The beneficial owner withholding certificate does not, however, 
contain an ITIN for G. On the following Monday, Casino B faxes a 
completed Form W-7, including the required certification, for G, to the 
IRS for an expedited ITIN. Pursuant to paragraph (b) and (g)(2) of this 
section, absent actual knowledge or reason to know otherwise, Casino B, 
may rely on the documentation furnished by G at the time of payment and 
pay the $5000 to G without withholding U.S. tax based on the treaty 
exemption.
    Example 2. The facts are the same as Example 1, except G visits 
Casino B on Monday. G requests payment Monday afternoon. In order to pay 
the winnings to G without withholding the 30 percent tax, Casino B must 
apply for and obtain an ITIN for G because an expedited ITIN is 
available from the IRS at the time of the $5000 payment to G.
    Example 3. The facts are the same as Example 1, except G requests 
payment fifteen minutes before the time when the IRS begins issuing 
ITINs. Under these facts, it would be reasonable for Casino B to delay 
payment to G. Therefore, Casino B must apply for and obtain an ITIN for 
G if G wishes to claim an exemption from U.S. withholding tax under

[[Page 144]]

the U.S.--Y tax treaty at the time of payment.
    Example 4. P, a citizen and resident of Country Z, is a lawyer and a 
well-known expert on real estate transactions. P is scheduled to attend 
a three-day seminar on complex real estate transactions, as a 
participant, at University U, a U.S. university, beginning on a Saturday 
and ending on the following Monday, which is a holiday. University U has 
entered into a special acceptance agent agreement with the IRS that 
permits University U to request an ITIN on an expedited basis. Country Z 
is a country with which the United States has an income tax treaty that 
exempts certain income earned from the performance of independent 
personal services from U.S. tax. It is P's first visit to the United 
States. On Saturday, prior to the start of the seminar, Professor Q, one 
of the lecturers at the seminar, cancels his lecture. That same day the 
Dean of University U offers P $5000, to replace Professor Q at the 
seminar, payable at the conclusion of the seminar on Monday. P agrees. P 
gives her lecture Sunday afternoon. ITINs are not available from the IRS 
on that Saturday, Sunday, or Monday. After the seminar ends on Monday, 
P, who does not have an ITIN, requests payment for her teaching. P 
furnishes a beneficial owner withholding certificate, described in Sec. 
1.1441-1(e)(2), to University U that represents that P is a resident of 
Country Z (within the meaning of the U.S.--Z tax treaty) and meets all 
applicable requirements for claiming benefits under the U.S.--Z tax 
treaty. The beneficial owner withholding certificate does not, however, 
contain an ITIN for P. On Tuesday, University U faxes a completed Form 
W-7, including the required certification, for P, to the IRS for an 
expedited ITIN. Pursuant to paragraph (b) and (g)(2) of this section, 
absent actual knowledge or reason to know otherwise, University U may 
rely on the documentation furnished by P and pay $5000 to P without 
withholding U.S. tax based on the treaty exemption.

    (h) Effective dates--(1) General rule. This section applies to 
payments made after December 31, 2000, except for paragraph (g) of this 
section which applies to payments made after December 31, 2001.
    (2) Transition rules. For purposes of this section, the validity of 
a Form 1001 or 8233 that was valid on January 1, 1998, under the 
regulations in effect prior to January 1, 2001 (see 26 CFR parts 1 and 
35a, revised April 1, 1999) and expired, or will expire, at any time 
during 1998, is extended until December 31, 1998. The validity of a Form 
1001 or 8233 that is valid on or after January 1, 1999, remains valid 
until its validity expires under the regulations in effect prior to 
January 1, 2001 (see 26 CFR parts 1 and 35a, revised April 1, 1999) but 
in no event will such a form remain valid after December 31, 2000. The 
rule in this paragraph (h)(2), however, does not apply to extend the 
validity period of a Form 1001 or 8233 that expires solely by reason of 
changes in the circumstances of the person whose name is on the 
certificate or in interpretation of the law under the regulations under 
Sec. 1.894-1T(d). Notwithstanding the first three sentences of this 
paragraph (h)(2), a withholding agent may choose to not take advantage 
of the transition rule in this paragraph (h)(2) with respect to one or 
more withholding certificates valid under the regulations in effect 
prior to January 1, 2001 (see 26 CFR parts 1 and 35a, revised April 1, 
1999) and, therefore, to require withholding certificates conforming to 
the requirements described in this section (new withholding 
certificates). For purposes of this section, a new withholding 
certificate is deemed to satisfy the documentation requirement under the 
regulations in effect prior to January 1, 2001 (see 26 CFR parts 1 and 
35a, revised April 1, 1999). Further, a new withholding certificate 
remains valid for the period specified in Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(4)(ii), 
regardless of when the certificate is obtained.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1441-7  General provisions relating to withholding agents.

    (a) Withholding agent defined--(1) In general. For purposes of 
chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations under such 
chapter, the term withholding agent means any person, U.S. or foreign, 
that has the control, receipt, custody, disposal, or payment of an item 
of income of a foreign person subject to withholding, including (but not 
limited to) a foreign intermediary described in Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(3)(i), 
a foreign partnership, or a U.S. branch described in Sec. 1.1441-
1(b)(2)(iv)(A) or (E). See Sec. Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(2) and (3) and 1.1441-

[[Page 145]]

5(c), (d), and (e), for rules to determine whether a payment is 
considered made to a foreign person. Any person who meets the definition 
of a withholding agent is required to deposit any tax withheld under 
Sec. 1.1461-1(a) and to make the returns prescribed by Sec. 1.1461-
1(b) and (c), except as otherwise may be required by a qualified 
intermediary withholding agreement, a withholding foreign partnership 
agreement, or a withholding foreign trust agreement. When several 
persons qualify as withholding agents with respect to a single payment, 
only one tax is required to be withheld and deposited. See Sec. 1.1461-
1. A person who, as a nominee described in Sec. 1.6031(c)-1T, has 
furnished to a partnership all of the information required to be 
furnished under Sec. 1.6031(c)-1T(a) shall not be treated as a 
withholding agent if it has notified the partnership that it is treating 
the provision of information to the partnership as a discharge of its 
obligations as a withholding agent.
    (2) Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section:

    Example 1. USB is a broker organized in the United States. USB pays 
U.S. source dividends and interest, which are amounts subject to 
withholding under Sec. 1.1441-2(a), to FC, a foreign corporation that 
has an investment account with USB. USB is a withholding agent as 
defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    Example 2. USB is a bank organized in the United States. FB is a 
bank organized in country X. X has an omnibus account with USB through 
which FB invests in debt and equity instruments that pay amounts subject 
to withholding as defined in Sec. 1.1441-2(a). FB is a nonqualified 
intermediary, as defined in Sec. 1.1441-1(c)(14). Both USB and FB are 
withholding agents as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example 2, except that FB is 
a qualified intermediary. Both USB and FB are withholding agents as 
defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    Example 4. FB is a bank organized in country X. FB has a branch in 
the United States. FB's branch has customers that are foreign persons 
who receive amounts subject to withholding, as defined in Sec. 1.1441-
2(a). FB is a withholding agent under paragraph (a)(1) of this section 
and is required to withhold and report payments of amounts subject to 
withholding in accordance with chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code.
    Example 5. X is a foreign corporation. X pays dividends to 
shareholders who are foreign persons. Under section 861(a)(2)(B), a 
portion of the dividends are from sources within the United States and 
constitute amounts subject to withholding within the meaning of Sec. 
1.1441-2(a). The dividends are not subject to tax under section 884(a). 
See 884(e)(3). X is a withholding agent under paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section.

    (b) Standards of knowledge--(1) In general. A withholding agent must 
withhold at the full 30-percent rate under section 1441, 1442, or 
1443(a) or at the full 4-percent rate under section 1443(b) if it has 
actual knowledge or reason to know that a claim of U.S. status or of a 
reduced rate of withholding under section 1441, 1442, or 1443 is 
unreliable or incorrect. A withholding agent shall be liable for tax, 
interest, and penalties to the extent provided under sections 1461 and 
1463 and the regulations under those sections if it fails to withhold 
the correct amount despite its actual knowledge or reason to know the 
amount required to be withheld. For purposes of the regulations under 
sections 1441, 1442, and 1443, a withholding agent may rely on 
information or certifications contained in, or associated with, a 
withholding certificate or other documentation furnished by or for a 
beneficial owner or payee unless the withholding agent has actual 
knowledge or reason to know that the information or certifications are 
incorrect or unreliable and, if based on such knowledge or reason to 
know, it should withhold (under chapter 3 of the Code or another 
withholding provision of the Code) an amount greater than would be the 
case if it relied on the information or certifications, or it should 
report (under chapter 3 of the Code or under another provision of the 
Code) an amount that would not otherwise be reportable if it relied on 
the information or certifications. See Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(4)(viii) for 
applicable reliance rules. A withholding agent that has received 
notification by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that a claim of U.S. 
status or of a reduced rate is incorrect has actual knowledge beginning 
on the date that is 30 calendar days after the date the notice is 
received. A withholding agent that fails to act in accordance with the 
presumptions set forth in Sec. Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3), 1.1441-

[[Page 146]]

4(a), 1.1441-5 (d) and (e), or 1.1441-9(b)(3) may also be liable for 
tax, interest, and penalties. See Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(ix) and (7).
    (2) Reason to know. A withholding agent shall be considered to have 
reason to know if its knowledge of relevant facts or of statements 
contained in the withholding certificates or other documentation is such 
that a reasonably prudent person in the position of the withholding 
agent would question the claims made.
    (3) Financial institutions--limits on reason to know. For purposes 
of this paragraph (b)(3) and paragraphs (b)(4) through (b)(10) of this 
section, the terms withholding certificate, documentary evidence, and 
documentation are defined in Sec. 1.1441-1(c)(16), (17) and (18). 
Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (b)(4) through (b)(9) of this 
section, a withholding agent that is a financial institution (including 
a regulated investment company) that has a direct account relationship 
with a beneficial owner (a direct account holder) has a reason to know, 
with respect to amounts described in Sec. 1.1441-6(c)(2), that 
documentation provided by the direct account holder is unreliable or 
incorrect only if one or more of the circumstances described in 
paragraphs (b)(4) through (b)(9) of this section exist. If a direct 
account holder has provided documentation that is unreliable or 
incorrect under the rules of paragraph (b)(4) through (b)(9) of this 
section, the withholding agent may require new documentation. 
Alternatively, the withholding agent may rely on the documentation 
originally provided if the rules of paragraphs (b)(4) through (b)(9) of 
this section permit such reliance based on additional statements and 
documentation. Paragraph (b)(10) of this section provides limits on 
reason to know for financial institutions that receive beneficial owner 
documentation from persons (indirect account holders) that have an 
account relationship with, or an ownership interest in, a direct account 
holder. For rules regarding reliance on Form W-9, see Sec. 31.3406(g)-
3(e)(2) of this chapter.
    (4) Rules applicable to withholding certificates--(i) In general. A 
withholding agent has reason to know that a beneficial owner withholding 
certificate provided by a direct account holder in connection with a 
payment of an amount described in Sec. 1.1441-6(c)(2) is unreliable or 
incorrect if the withholding certificate is incomplete with respect to 
any item on the certificate that is relevant to the claims made by the 
direct account holder, the withholding certificate contains any 
information that is inconsistent with the direct account holder's claim, 
the withholding agent has other account information that is inconsistent 
with the direct account holder's claim, or the withholding certificate 
lacks information necessary to establish entitlement to a reduced rate 
of withholding. For purposes of establishing a direct account holder's 
status as a foreign person or resident of a treaty country a withholding 
certificate shall be considered unreliable or inconsistent with an 
account holder's claims only if it is not reliable under the rules of 
paragraphs (b)(5) and (6) of this section. A withholding agent that 
relies on an agent to review and maintain a withholding certificate is 
considered to know or have reason to know the facts within the knowledge 
of the agent.
    (ii) Examples. The rules of paragraph (b)(4) of this section are 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. F, a foreign person that has a direct account 
relationship with USB, a bank that is a U.S. person, provides USB with a 
beneficial owner withholding certificate for the purpose of claiming a 
reduced rate of withholding on U.S. source dividends. F resides in a 
treaty country that has a limitation on benefits provision in its income 
tax treaty with the United States. The withholding certificate, however, 
does not contain a statement regarding limitations on benefits or 
deriving the income under section 894 as required by Sec. 1.1441-
6(b)(1). USB cannot rely on the withholding certificate to grant a 
reduced rate of withholding because it is incomplete with respect to the 
claim made by F.
    Example 2. F, a foreign person that has a direct account 
relationship with USB, a broker that is a U.S. person, provides USB with 
a withholding certificate for the purpose of claiming the portfolio 
interest exception under section 881(c), which applies to foreign 
corporations. F indicates on its withholding certificate, however, that 
it is a partnership. USB may not treat F as a beneficial owner of the 
interest for purposes of the portfolio interest exception because F has 
indicated on

[[Page 147]]

its withholding certificate that it is a foreign partnership, and 
therefore under Sec. 1.1441-1(c)(6)(ii) it is not the beneficial owner 
of the interest payment.

    (5) Withholding certificate--establishment of foreign status. A 
withholding agent has reason to know that a beneficial owner withholding 
certificate (as defined in Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(2)) provided by a direct 
account holder in connection with a payment of an amount described in 
Sec. 1.1441-6(c)(2) is unreliable or incorrect for purposes of 
establishing the account holder's status as a foreign person if the 
certificate is described in paragraph (b)(5)(i) or (ii) of this section.
    (i) A withholding certificate is unreliable or incorrect if the 
withholding certificate has a permanent residence address (as defined in 
Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(2)(ii)) in the United States, the withholding 
certificate has a mailing address in the United States, the withholding 
agent has a residence or mailing address as part of its account 
information that is an address in the United States, or the direct 
account holder notifies the withholding agent of a new residence or 
mailing address in the United States (whether or not provided on a 
withholding certificate). A withholding agent may, however, rely on the 
beneficial owner withholding certificate as establishing the account 
holder's foreign status if it may do so under the provisions of 
paragraph (b)(5)(i)(A) or (B) of this section.
    (A) A withholding agent may treat a direct account holder as a 
foreign person if the beneficial owner withholding certificate has been 
provided by an individual and--
    (1) The withholding agent has in its possession or obtains 
documentary evidence (which does not contain a U.S. address) that has 
been provided within the past three years, was valid at the time it was 
provided, the documentary evidence supports the claim of foreign status, 
and the direct account holder provides the withholding agent with a 
reasonable explanation, in writing, supporting the account holder's 
foreign status; or
    (2) The account is maintained at an office of the withholding agent 
outside the United States and the withholding agent is required to 
report annually a payment to the direct account holder on a tax 
information statement that is filed with the tax authority of the 
country in which the office is located and that country has an income 
tax treaty in effect with the United States.
    (B) A withholding agent may treat an account holder as a foreign 
person if the beneficial owner withholding certificate has been provided 
by an entity that the withholding agent does not know, or does not have 
reason to know, is a flow-through entity and--
    (1) The withholding agent has in its possession, or obtains, 
documentation that substantiates that the entity is actually organized 
or created under the laws of a foreign country; or
    (2) The account is maintained at an office of the withholding agent 
outside the United States and the withholding agent is required to 
report annually a payment to the direct account holder on a tax 
information statement that is filed with the tax authority of the 
country in which the office is located and that country has an income 
tax treaty in effect with the United States.
    (ii) A beneficial owner withholding certificate is unreliable or 
incorrect if it is provided with respect to an offshore account (as 
defined in Sec. 1.6049-5(c)(1)) and the direct account holder has 
standing instructions directing the withholding agent to pay amounts 
from its account to an address or an account maintained in the United 
States. The withholding agent may treat the direct account holder as a 
foreign person, however, if the direct account holder provides a 
reasonable explanation in writing that supports its foreign status.
    (6) Withholding certificate--claim of reduced rate of withholding 
under treaty. A withholding agent has reason to know that a withholding 
certificate (other than Form W-9) provided by a direct account holder in 
connection with a payment of an amount described in Sec. 1.1441-6(c)(2) 
is unreliable or incorrect for purposes of establishing that the direct 
account holder is a resident of a country with which the United States 
has an income tax treaty if it is described in paragraphs (b)(6)(i) 
through (iii) of this section.
    (i) A beneficial owner withholding certificate is unreliable or 
incorrect if

[[Page 148]]

the permanent residence address on the beneficial owner withholding 
certificate is not in the country whose treaty is invoked, or the direct 
account holder notifies the withholding agent of a new permanent 
residence address that is not in the treaty country. A withholding agent 
may, however, treat a direct account holder as entitled to a reduced 
rate of withholding under an income tax treaty if the direct account 
holder provides a reasonable explanation for the permanent residence 
address outside the treaty country (e.g., the address is the address of 
a branch of the beneficial owner located outside the treaty country in 
which the entity is a resident) or the withholding agent has in its 
possession, or obtains, documentary evidence that establishes residency 
in a treaty country.
    (ii) A beneficial owner withholding certificate is unreliable or 
incorrect if the permanent residence address on the withholding 
certificate is in the applicable treaty country but the withholding 
certificate contains a mailing address outside the treaty country or the 
withholding agent has a mailing address as part of its account 
information that is outside the treaty country. A mailing address that 
is a P.O. Box, in-care-of address, or address at a financial institution 
(if the financial institution is not a beneficial owner) shall not 
preclude a withholding agent from treating the direct account holder as 
a resident of a treaty country if such address is in the treaty country. 
If a withholding agent has a mailing address (whether or not contained 
on the withholding certificate) outside the applicable treaty country, 
the withholding agent may nevertheless treat a direct account holder as 
a resident of an applicable treaty country if--
    (A) The withholding agent has in its possession, or obtains, 
additional documentation supporting the direct account holder's claim of 
residence in the applicable treaty country (and the additional 
documentation does not contain an address outside the treaty country);
    (B) The withholding agent has in its possession, or obtains, 
documentation that establishes that the direct account holder is an 
entity organized in a treaty country (or an entity managed and 
controlled in a treaty country, if the applicable treaty so requires);
    (C) The withholding agent knows that the address outside the 
applicable treaty country (other than a P.O. box, or in-care-of address) 
is a branch of a bank or insurance company that is a resident of the 
applicable treaty country; or
    (D) The withholding agent obtains a written statement from the 
direct account holder that reasonably establishes entitlement to treaty 
benefits.
    (iii) A beneficial owner withholding certificate is unreliable or 
incorrect to establish entitlement to a reduced rate of withholding 
under an income tax treaty if the direct account holder has standing 
instructions for the withholding agent to pay amounts from its account 
to an address or an account outside the treaty country unless the direct 
account holder provides a reasonable explanation, in writing, 
establishing the direct account holder's residence in the applicable 
treaty country.
    (7) Documentary evidence. A withholding agent shall not treat 
documentary evidence provided by a direct account holder as valid if the 
documentary evidence does not reasonably establish the identity of the 
person presenting the documentary evidence. For example, documentary 
evidence is not valid if it is provided in person by a direct account 
holder that is a natural person and the photograph or signature on the 
documentary evidence, if any, does not match the appearance or signature 
of the person presenting the document. A withholding agent shall not 
rely on documentary evidence to reduce the rate of withholding that 
would otherwise apply under the presumption rules of Sec. Sec. 1.1441-
1(b)(3), 1.1441-5(d) and (e)(6), and 1.6049-5(d) if the documentary 
evidence contains information that is inconsistent with the direct 
account holder's claim of a reduced rate of withholding, the withholding 
agent has other account information that is inconsistent with the direct 
account holder's claim, or the documentary evidence lacks information 
necessary to establish entitlement to a reduced rate of withholding. For 
example, if a direct account holder provides documentary evidence to 
claim treaty benefits and the documentary

[[Page 149]]

evidence establishes the direct account holder's status as a foreign 
person and a resident of a treaty country, but the account holder fails 
to provide the treaty statements required by Sec. 1.1441-6(c)(5), the 
documentary evidence does not establish the direct account holder's 
entitlement to a reduced rate of withholding. For purposes of 
establishing a direct account holder's status as a foreign person or 
resident of a country with which the United States has an income tax 
treaty with respect to income described in Sec. 1.1441-6(c)(2), 
documentary evidence shall be considered unreliable or incorrect only if 
it is not reliable under the rules of paragraph (b)(8) and (9) of this 
section.
    (8) Documentary evidence--establishment of foreign status. A 
withholding agent has reason to know that documentary evidence provided 
in connection with a payment of an amount described in Sec. 1.1441-
6(c)(2) is unreliable or incorrect for purposes of establishing the 
direct account holder's status as a foreign person if the documentary 
evidence is described in paragraphs (b)(8)(i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of 
this section.
    (i) A withholding agent shall not treat documentary evidence 
provided by an account holder after December 31, 2000, as valid for 
purposes of establishing the direct account holder's foreign status if 
the only mailing or residence address that is available to the 
withholding agent is an address at a financial institution (unless the 
financial institution is a beneficial owner of the income), an in-care-
of address, or a P.O. box. In this case, the withholding agent must 
obtain additional documentation that is sufficient to establish the 
direct account holder's status as a foreign person. A withholding agent 
shall not treat documentary evidence provided by an account holder 
before January 1, 2001, as valid for purposes of establishing a direct 
account holder's status as a foreign person if it has actual knowledge 
that the direct account holder is a U.S. person or if it has a mailing 
or residence address for the direct account holder in the United States. 
If a withholding agent has an address for the direct account holder in 
the United States, the withholding agent may nevertheless treat the 
direct account holder as a foreign person if it can so treat the direct 
account holder under the rules of paragraph (b)(8)(ii) of this section.
    (ii) Documentary evidence is unreliable or incorrect to establish a 
direct account holder's status as a foreign person if the withholding 
agent has a mailing or residence address (whether or not on the 
documentation) for the direct account holder in the United States or if 
the direct account holder notifies the withholding agent of a new 
address in the United States. A withholding agent may, however, rely on 
documentary evidence as establishing the direct account holder's foreign 
status if it may do so under the provisions of paragraph (b)(8)(ii)(A) 
or (B) of this section.
    (A) A withholding agent may treat a direct account holder that is an 
individual as a foreign person even if it has a mailing or residence 
address for the direct account holder in the United States if the 
withholding agent--
    (1) Has in its possession or obtains additional documentary evidence 
(which does not contain a U.S. address) supporting the claim of foreign 
status and a reasonable explanation in writing supporting the account 
holder's foreign status;
    (2) Has in its possession or obtains a valid beneficial owner 
withholding certificate on Form W-8 and the Form W-8 contains a 
permanent residence address outside the United States and a mailing 
address outside the United States (or if a mailing address is inside the 
United States the direct account holder provides a reasonable 
explanation in writing supporting the direct account holder's foreign 
status); or
    (3) The account is maintained at an office of the withholding agent 
outside the United States and the withholding agent is required to 
report annually a payment to the direct account holder on a tax 
information statement that is filed with the tax authority of the 
country in which the office is located and that country has an income 
tax treaty in effect with the United States.
    (B) A withholding agent may treat a direct account holder that is an 
entity (other than a flow-through entity) as a foreign person even if it 
has a mailing

[[Page 150]]

or residence address for the direct account holder in the United States 
if the withholding agent--
    (1) Has in its possession, or obtains, documentation that 
substantiates that the entity is actually organized or created under the 
laws of a foreign country;
    (2) Obtains a valid beneficial owner withholding certificate on Form 
W-8 and the Form W-8 contains a permanent residence address outside the 
United States and a mailing address outside the United States (or if a 
mailing address is inside the United States the direct account holder 
provides additional documentary evidence sufficient to establish the 
direct account holder's foreign status); or
    (3) The account is maintained at an office of the withholding agent 
outside the United States and the withholding agent is required to 
report annually a payment to the direct account holder on a tax 
information statement that is filed with the tax authority of the 
country in which the office is located and that country has an income 
tax treaty in effect with the United States.
    (iii) Documentary evidence is unreliable or incorrect if the direct 
account holder has standing instructions directing the withholding agent 
to pay amounts from its account to an address or an account maintained 
in the United States. The withholding agent may treat the direct account 
holder as a foreign person, however, if the account holder provides a 
reasonable explanation in writing that supports its foreign status.
    (9) Documentary evidence--claim of reduced rate of withholding under 
treaty. A withholding agent has reason to know that documentary evidence 
provided in connection with a payment of an amount described in Sec. 
1.1441-6(c)(2) is unreliable or incorrect for purposes of establishing 
that a direct account holder is a resident of a country with which the 
United States has an income tax treaty if it is described in paragraph 
(b)(9)(i) or (ii) of this section.
    (i) Documentary evidence is unreliable or incorrect if the 
withholding agent has a mailing or residence address for the direct 
account holder (whether or not on the documentary evidence) that is 
outside the applicable treaty country, or the only address that the 
withholding agent has (whether in or outside of the applicable treaty 
country) is a P.O. box, an in-care-of address, or the address of a 
financial institution (if the financial institution is not the 
beneficial owner). If a withholding agent has a mailing or residence 
address for the direct account holder outside the applicable treaty 
country, the withholding agent may nevertheless treat a direct account 
holder as a resident of an applicable treaty country if the withholding 
agent--
    (A) Has in its possession, or obtains, additional documentary 
evidence supporting the direct account holder's claim of residence in 
the applicable treaty country (and the documentary evidence does not 
contain an address outside the applicable treaty country, a P.O. box, an 
in-care-of address, or the address of a financial institution);
    (B) Has in its possession, or obtains, documentary evidence that 
establishes the direct account holder is an entity organized in a treaty 
country (or an entity managed and controlled in a treaty country, if the 
applicable treaty so requires); or
    (C) Obtains a valid beneficial owner withholding certificate on Form 
W-8 that contains a permanent residence address and a mailing address in 
the applicable treaty country.
    (ii) Documentary evidence is unreliable or incorrect if the direct 
account holder has standing instructions directing the withholding agent 
to pay amounts from its account to an address or an account maintained 
outside the treaty country unless the direct account holder provides a 
reasonable explanation, in writing, establishing the direct account 
holder's residence in the applicable treaty country.
    (10) Limits on reason to know--indirect account holders. A financial 
institution that receives documentation from a payee through a 
nonqualified intermediary, a flow-through entity, or a U.S. branch 
described in Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv) (other than a U.S. branch that is 
treated as a U.S. person) with respect to a payment of an amount 
described in Sec. 1.1441-6(c)(2) has reason to

[[Page 151]]

know that the documentation is unreliable or incorrect if a reasonably 
prudent person in the position of a withholding agent would question the 
claims made. This standard requires, but is not limited to, a 
withholding agent's compliance with the rules of paragraphs (b)(10)(i) 
through (iii).
    (i) The withholding agent must review the withholding statement 
described in Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iv) and may not rely on information in 
the statement to the extent the information does not support the claims 
made for any payee. For this purpose, a withholding agent may not treat 
a payee as a foreign person if an address in the United States is 
provided for such payee and may not treat a person as a resident of a 
country with which the United States has an income tax treaty if the 
address for that person is outside the applicable treaty country. 
Notwithstanding a U.S. address or an address outside a treaty country, 
the withholding agent may treat a payee as a foreign person or a foreign 
person as a resident of a treaty country if a reasonable explanation is 
provided, in writing, by the nonqualified intermediary, flow-through 
entity, or U.S. branch supporting the payee's foreign status or the 
foreign person's residency in a treaty country.
    (ii) The withholding agent must review each withholding certificate 
in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (b)(5) and (6) of this 
section and verify that the information on the withholding certificate 
is consistent with the information on the withholding statement required 
under Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iv). If there is a discrepancy between the 
withholding certificate and the withholding statement, the withholding 
agent may choose to rely on the withholding certificate, if valid, and 
instruct the nonqualified intermediary, flow-through entity, or U.S. 
branch to correct the withholding statement or apply the presumption 
rules of Sec. Sec. 1.1441-1(b), 1.1441-5(d) and (e)(6), and 1.6049-5(d) 
to the payment allocable to the payee who provided the withholding 
certificate. A withholding agent that receives a withholding certificate 
before December 31, 2001, is not required to review the information on 
withholding certificates or determine if it is consistent with the 
information on the withholding statement until December 31, 2001. A 
withholding agent may withhold and report in accordance with a 
withholding statement until December 31, 2001, unless it has actually 
performed the verification procedures required by this paragraph 
(b)(10)(ii) and determined that the withholding statement is inaccurate 
with respect to a particular payee.
    (iii) The withholding agent must review the documentary evidence 
provided by the nonqualified intermediary, flow-through entity, or U.S. 
branch to determine that there is no obvious indication that the payee 
is a U.S. non-exempt recipient or that the documentary evidence does not 
establish the identity of the person who provided the documentation 
(e.g., the documentary evidence does not appear to be an identification 
document).
    (11) Additional guidance. The IRS may prescribe other circumstances 
for which a withholding certificate or documentary evidence is 
unreliable or incorrect in addition to the circumstances described in 
paragraph (b) of this section to establish an account holder's status as 
a foreign person or a beneficial owner entitled to a reduced rate of 
withholding in published guidance (see Sec. 601.601(d)(2) of this 
chapter).
    (c) Authorized agent--(1) In general. The acts of an agent of a 
withholding agent (including the receipt of withholding certificates, 
the payment of amounts of income subject to withholding, and the deposit 
of tax withheld) are imputed to the withholding agent on whose behalf it 
is acting. However, if the agent is a foreign person, a withholding 
agent that is a U.S. person may treat the acts of the foreign agent as 
its own for purposes of determining whether it has complied with the 
provisions of this section, but only if the agent is an authorized 
foreign agent, as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. An 
authorized foreign agent cannot apply the provisions of this paragraph 
(c) to appoint another person its authorized foreign agent with respect 
to the payments it receives from the withholding agent.
    (2) Authorized foreign agent. An agent is an authorized foreign 
agent only if--

[[Page 152]]

    (i) There is a written agreement between the withholding agent and 
the foreign person acting as agent;
    (ii) The notification procedures described in paragraph (c)(3) of 
this section have been complied with;
    (iii) Books and records and relevant personnel of the foreign agent 
are available (on a continuous basis, including after termination of the 
relationship) for examination by the IRS in order to evaluate the 
withholding agent's compliance with the provisions of chapters 3 and 61 
of the Code, section 3406, and the regulations under those provisions; 
and
    (iv) The U.S. withholding agent remains fully liable for the acts of 
its agent and does not assert any of the defenses that may otherwise be 
available, including under common law principles of agency in order to 
avoid tax liability under the Internal Revenue Code.
    (3) Notification. A withholding agent that appoints an authorized 
agent to act on its behalf for purposes of Sec. 1.871-14(c)(2), the 
withholding provisions of chapter 3 of the Code, section 3406 or other 
withholding provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, or the reporting 
provisions of chapter 61 of the Code, is required to file notice of such 
appointment with the Office of the Assistant Commissioner 
(International). Such notice shall be filed before the first payment for 
which the authorized agent acts as such. Such notice shall acknowledge 
the withholding agent liability as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of 
this section.
    (4) Liability of U.S. withholding agent. An authorized foreign agent 
is subject to the same withholding and reporting obligations that apply 
to any withholding agent under the provisions of chapter 3 of the Code 
and the regulations thereunder. In particular, an authorized foreign 
agent does not benefit from the special procedures or exceptions that 
may apply to a qualified intermediary. A withholding agent acting 
through an authorized foreign agent is liable for any failure of the 
agent, such as failure to withhold an amount or make payment of tax, in 
the same manner and to the same extent as if the agent's failure had 
been the failure of the U.S. withholding agent. For this purpose, the 
foreign agent's actual knowledge or reason to know shall be imputed to 
the U.S. withholding agent. The U.S. withholding agent's liability shall 
exist irrespective of the fact that the authorized foreign agent is also 
a withholding agent and is itself separately liable for failure to 
comply with the provisions of the regulations under section 1441, 1442, 
or 1443. However, the same tax, interest, or penalties shall not be 
collected more than once.
    (5) Filing of returns. See Sec. 1.1461-1(b)(2)(iii) and (c)(4)(iii) 
regarding returns required to be made where a U.S. withholding agent 
acts through an authorized foreign agent.
    (d) United States obligations. If the United States is a withholding 
agent for an item of interest, including original issue discount, on 
obligations of the United States or of any agency or instrumentality 
thereof, the withholding obligation of the United States is assumed and 
discharged by--
    (1) The Commissioner of the Public Debt, for interest paid by checks 
issued through the Bureau of the Public Debt;
    (2) The Treasurer of the United States, for interest paid by him or 
her, whether by check or otherwise;
    (3) Each Federal Reserve Bank, for interest paid by it, whether by 
check or otherwise; or
    (4) Such other person as may be designated by the IRS.
    (e) Assumed obligations. If, in connection with the sale of a 
corporation's property, payment on the bonds or other obligations of the 
corporation is assumed by a person, then that person shall be a 
withholding agent to the extent amounts subject to withholding are paid 
to a foreign person. Thus, the person shall withhold such amounts under 
Sec. 1.1441-1 as would be required to be withheld by the seller or 
corporation had no such sale or assumption been made.
    (f) Conduit financing arrangements--(1) Liability of withholding 
agent. Subject to paragraph (f)(2) of this section, any person that is 
required to deduct and withhold tax under Sec. 1.1441-3(g) is made 
liable for that tax by section 1461. A person that is required to deduct 
and withhold tax but fails to do so is liable for the payment of the tax 
and any applicable penalties and interest.

[[Page 153]]

    (2) Exception for withholding agents that do not know of conduit 
financing arrangement--(i) In general. A withholding agent will not be 
liable under paragraph (f)(1) of this section for failing to deduct and 
withhold with respect to a conduit financing arrangement unless the 
person knows or has reason to know that the financing arrangement is a 
conduit financing arrangement. This standard shall be satisfied if the 
withholding agent knows or has reason to know of facts sufficient to 
establish that the financing arrangement is a conduit financing 
arrangement, including facts sufficient to establish that the 
participation of the intermediate entity in the financing arrangement is 
pursuant to a tax avoidance plan. A withholding agent that knows only of 
the financing transactions that comprise the financing arrangement will 
not be considered to know or have reason to know of facts sufficient to 
establish that the financing arrangement is a conduit financing 
arrangement.
    (ii) Examples. The following examples illustrate the operation of 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

    Example 1. (i) DS is a U.S. subsidiary of FP, a corporation 
organized in Country N, a country that does not have an income tax 
treaty with the United States. FS is a special purpose subsidiary of FP 
that is incorporated in Country T, a country that has an income tax 
treaty with the United States that prohibits the imposition of 
withholding tax on payments of interest. FS is capitalized with 
$10,000,000 in debt from BK, a Country N bank, and $1,000,000 in capital 
from FS.
    (ii) On May 1, 1995, C, a U.S. person, purchases an automobile from 
DS in return for an installment note. On July 1, 1995, DS sells a number 
of installment notes, including C's, to FS in exchange for $10,000,000. 
DS continues to service the installment notes for FS and C is not 
notified of the sale of its obligation and continues to make payments to 
DS. But for the withholding tax on payments of interest by DS to BK, DS 
would have borrowed directly from BK, pledging the installment notes as 
collateral.
    (iii) The C installment note is a financing transaction, whether 
held by DS or by FS, and the FS note held by BK also is a financing 
transaction. After FS purchases the installment note, and during the 
time the installment note is held by FS, the transactions constitute a 
financing arrangement, within the meaning of Sec. 1.881-3(a)(2)(i). BK 
is the financing entity, FS is the intermediate entity, and C is the 
financed entity. Because the participation of FS in the financing 
arrangement reduces the tax imposed by section 881 and because there was 
a tax avoidance plan, FS is a conduit entity.
    (iv) Because C does not know or have reason to know of the tax 
avoidance plan (and by extension that the financing arrangement is a 
conduit financing arrangement), C is not required to withhold tax under 
section 1441. However, DS, who knows that FS's participation in the 
financing arrangement is pursuant to a tax avoidance plan and is a 
withholding agent for purposes of section 1441, is not relieved of its 
withholding responsibilities.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example, 1 except that C 
receives a new payment booklet on which DS is described as ``agent''. 
Although C may deduce that its installment note has been sold, without 
more C has no reason to know of the existence of a financing 
arrangement. Accordingly, C is not liable for failure to withhold, 
although DS still is not relieved of its withholding responsibilities.
    Example 3. (i) DC is a U.S. corporation that is in the process of 
negotiating a loan of $10,000,000 from BK1, a bank located in Country N, 
a country that does not have an income tax treaty with the United 
States. Before the loan agreement is signed, DC's tax lawyers point out 
that interest on the loan would not be subject to withholding tax if the 
loan were made by BK2, a subsidiary of BK1 that is incorporated in 
Country T, a country that has an income tax treaty with the United 
States that prohibits the imposition of withholding tax on payments of 
interest. BK1 makes a loan to BK2 to enable BK2 to make the loan to DC. 
Without the loan from BK1 to BK2, BK2 would not have been able to make 
the loan to DC.
    (ii) The loan from BK1 to BK2 and the loan from BK2 to DC are both 
financing transactions and together constitute a financing arrangement 
within the meaning of Sec. 1.881-3(a)(2)(i). BK1 is the financing 
entity, BK2 is the intermediate entity, and DC is the financed entity. 
Because the participation of BK2 in the financing arrangement reduces 
the tax imposed by section 881 and because there is a tax avoidance 
plan, BK2 is a conduit entity.
    (iii) Because DC is a party to the tax avoidance plan (and 
accordingly knows of its existence), DC must withhold tax under section 
1441. If DC does not withhold tax on its payment of interest, BK2, a 
party to the plan and a withholding agent for purposes of section 1441, 
must withhold tax as required by section 1441.
    Example 4. (i) DC is a U.S. corporation that has a long-standing 
banking relationship with BK2, a U.S. subsidiary of BK1, a bank 
incorporated in Country N, a country that does not have an income tax 
treaty with the United States. DC has borrowed amounts of

[[Page 154]]

as much as $75,000,000 from BK2 in the past. On January 1, 1995, DC asks 
to borrow $50,000,000 from BK2. BK2 does not have the funds available to 
make a loan of that size. BK2 considers asking BK1 to enter into a loan 
with DC but rejects this possibility because of the additional 
withholding tax that would be incurred. Accordingly, BK2 borrows the 
necessary amount from BK1 with the intention of on-lending to DC. BK1 
does not make the loan directly to DC because of the withholding tax 
that would apply to payments of interest from DC to BK1. DC does not 
negotiate with BK1 and has no reason to know that BK1 was the source of 
the loan.
    (ii) The loan from BK2 to DC and the loan from BK1 to BK2 are both 
financing transactions and together constitute a financing arrangement 
within the meaning of Sec. 1.881-3(a)(2)(i). BK1 is the financing 
entity, BK2 is the intermediate entity, and DC is the financed entity. 
The participation of BK2 in the financing arrangement reduces the tax 
imposed by section 881. Because the participation of BK2 in the 
financing arrangement reduces the tax imposed by section 881 and because 
there was a tax avoidance plan, BK2 is a conduit entity.
    (iii) Because DC does not know or have reason to know of the tax 
avoidance plan (and by extension that the financing arrangement is a 
conduit financing arrangement), DC is not required to withhold tax under 
section 1441. However, BK2, who is also a withholding agent under 
section 1441 and who knows that the financing arrangement is a conduit 
financing arrangement, is not relieved of its withholding 
responsibilities.

    (3) Effective date. This paragraph (f) is effective for payments 
made by financed entities on or after September 11, 1995. This paragraph 
shall not apply to interest payments covered by section 127(g)(3) of the 
Tax Reform Act of 1984, and to interest payments with respect to other 
debt obligations issued prior to October 15, 1984 (whether or not such 
debt was issued by a Netherlands Antilles corporation).
    (g) Effective date. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (f)(3) 
of this section, this section applies to payments made after December 
31, 2000.

Sec. 1.1441-8  Exemption from withholding for payments to foreign 

governments, international organizations, foreign central banks of 
issue, and the Bank for International Settlements.

    (a) Foreign governments. Under section 892, certain specific types 
of income received by foreign governments are excluded from gross income 
and are exempt from taxation, unless derived from the conduct of a 
commercial activity or received from or by a controlled commercial 
entity. Accordingly, withholding is not required under Sec. 1.1441.1 
with regard to any item of income which is exempt from taxation under 
section 892.
    (b) Reliance on claim of exemption by foreign government. Absent 
actual knowledge or reason to know otherwise, the withholding agent may 
rely upon a claim of exemption made by the foreign government if, prior 
to the payment, the withholding agent can reliably associate the payment 
with documentation upon which it can rely to treat the payment as made 
to a beneficial owner in accordance with Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(1)(ii). A 
Form W-8 furnished by a foreign government for purposes of claiming an 
exemption under this paragraph (b) is valid only if, in addition to 
other applicable requirements, it certifies that the income is, or will 
be, exempt from taxation under section 892 and the regulations under 
that section and whether the person whose name is on the certificate is 
an integral part of a foreign government (as defined in Sec. 1.892-
2T(a)(2)) or a controlled entity (as defined in Sec. 1.892-2T(a)(3)).
    (c) Income of a foreign central bank of issue or the Bank for 
International Settlements--(1) Certain interest income. Section 895 
provides for the exclusion from gross income of certain income derived 
by a foreign central bank of issue, or by the Bank for International 
Settlements, from obligations of the United States or of any agency or 
instrumentality thereof or from interest on deposits with persons 
carrying on the banking business if the bank is the owner of the 
obligations or deposits and does not hold the obligations or deposits 
for, or use them in connection with, the conduct of a commercial banking 
function or other commercial

[[Page 155]]

activity by such bank. See Sec. 1.895-1. Absent actual knowledge or 
reason to know that a foreign central bank of issue, or the Bank for 
International Settlements, is operating outside the scope of the 
exclusion granted by section 895 and the regulations under that section, 
the withholding agent may rely on a claim of exemption if, prior to the 
payment, the withholding agent can reliably associate the payment with 
documentation upon which it can rely to treat the foreign central bank 
of issue or the Bank for International Settlements as the beneficial 
owner of the payment in accordance with Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(1)(ii). A Form 
W-8 furnished by a foreign central bank of issue or the Bank for 
International Settlements for purposes of claiming an exemption under 
this paragraph (c)(1) is valid only if, in addition to other applicable 
requirements, it certifies that the person whose name is on the 
certificate is a foreign central bank of issue, or the Bank for 
International Settlements, and that the bank does not, and will not, 
hold the obligations or the bank deposits covered by the Form W-8 for, 
or use them in connection with, the conduct of a commercial banking 
function or other commercial activity.
    (2) Bankers acceptances. Interest derived by a foreign central bank 
of issue from bankers acceptances is exempt from tax under sections 
871(i)(2)(C) and 881(d) and Sec. 1.861-2(b)(4). With respect to 
bankers' acceptances, a withholding agent may treat a payee as a foreign 
central bank of issue without requiring a withholding certificate if the 
name of the payee and other facts surrounding the payment reasonably 
indicate that the payee or beneficial owner is a foreign central bank of 
issue, as defined in Sec. 1.861-2(b)(4).
    (d) Exemption for payments to international organizations. A payment 
to an international organization (within the meaning of section 
7701(a)(18)) is exempt from withholding on any payment. A withholding 
agent may treat a payee as an international organization without 
requiring a withholding certificate if the name of the payee is one that 
is designated as an international organization by executive order 
(pursuant to 22 U.S.C. 288 through 288(f)) and other facts surrounding 
the transaction reasonably indicate that the international organization 
is the beneficial owner of the payment.
    (e) Failure to receive withholding certificate timely and other 
applicable procedures. See applicable procedures described in Sec. 
1.1441-1(b)(7) in the event the withholding agent does not hold a valid 
withholding certificate described in paragraph (b) or (c)(1) of this 
section or other appropriate documentation at the time of payment. 
Further, the provisions of Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(4) shall apply to 
withholding certificates and other documents related thereto furnished 
under the provisions of this section.
    (f) Effective date--(1) In general. This section applies to payments 
made after December 31, 2000.
    (2) Transition rules. For purposes of this section, the validity of 
a Form 8709 that was valid on January 1, 1998, under the regulations in 
effect prior to January 1, 2001 (see 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 
1999) and expired, or will expire, at any time during 1998, is extended 
until December 31, 1998. The validity of a Form 8709 that is valid on or 
after January 1, 1999, remains valid until its validity expires under 
the regulations in effect prior to January 1, 2001 (see 26 CFR part 1, 
revised April 1, 1999) but in no event shall such a form remain valid 
after December 31, 2000. The rule in this paragraph (f)(2), however, 
does not apply to extend the validity period of a Form 8709 that expires 
solely by reason of changes in the circumstances of the person whose 
name is on the certificate. Notwithstanding the first three sentences of 
this paragraph (f)(2), a withholding agent may choose to not take 
advantage of the transition rule in this paragraph (f)(2) with respect 
to one or more withholding certificates valid under the regulations in 
effect prior to January 1, 2001 (see 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 
1999) and, therefore, to require withholding certificates conforming to 
the requirements described in this section (new withholding 
certificates). For purposes of this section, a new withholding 
certificate is deemed to satisfy the documentation requirement under the 
regulations in effect prior to January 1, 2001 (see 26 CFR part 1, 
revised

[[Page 156]]

April 1, 1999). Further, a new withholding certificate remains valid for 
the period specified in Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(4)(ii), regardless of when the 
certificate is obtained.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1441-9  Exemption from withholding on exempt income of a foreign 
tax-exempt organization, including foreign private foundations.

    (a) Exemption from withholding for exempt income. No withholding is 
required under section 1441(a) or 1442, and the regulations under those 
sections, on amounts paid to a foreign organization that is described in 
section 501(c) to the extent that the amounts are not income includable 
under section 512 in computing the organization's unrelated business 
taxable income. See, however, Sec. 1.1443-1 for withholding on payments 
of unrelated business income to foreign tax-exempt organizations and on 
payments subject to tax under section 4948. For a foreign organization 
to claim an exemption from withholding under section 1441(a) or 1442 
based on its status as an organization described in section 501(c), it 
must furnish the withholding agent with a withholding certificate 
described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. A foreign organization 
described in section 501(c) may choose to claim a reduced rate of 
withholding under the procedures described in other sections of the 
regulations under section 1441 and not under this section. In 
particular, if an organization chooses to claim benefits under an income 
tax treaty, the withholding procedures applicable to claims of such a 
reduced rate are governed solely by the provisions of Sec. 1.1441-6 and 
not of this section.
    (b) Reliance on foreign organization's claim of exemption from 
withholding--(1) General rule. A withholding agent may rely on a claim 
of exemption under this section only if, prior to the payment, the 
withholding agent can reliably associate the payment with a valid 
withholding certificate described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (2) Withholding certificate. A withholding certificate under this 
paragraph (b)(2) is valid only if it is a Form W-8 and if, in addition 
to other applicable requirements, the Form W-8 includes the taxpayer 
identifying number of the organization whose name is on the certificate, 
and it certifies that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has issued a 
favorable determination letter (and the date thereof) that is currently 
in effect, what portion, if any, of the amounts paid constitute income 
includible under section 512 in computing the organization's unrelated 
business taxable income, and, if the organization is described in 
section 501(c)(3), whether it is a private foundation described in 
section 509. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the organization 
cannot certify that it has been issued a favorable determination letter 
that is still in effect, its withholding certificate is nevertheless 
valid under this paragraph (b)(2) if the organization attaches to the 
withholding certificate an opinion that is acceptable to the withholding 
agent from a U.S. counsel (or any other person as the IRS may prescribe 
in published guidance (see Sec. 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter)) 
concluding that the organization is described in section 501(c). If the 
determination letter or opinion of counsel to which the withholding 
certificate refers concludes that the organization is described in 
section 501(c)(3), and the certificate further certifies that the 
organization is not a private foundation described in section 509, an 
affidavit of the organization setting forth sufficient facts concerning 
the operations and support of the organization for the Internal Revenue 
Service (IRS) to determine that such organization would be likely to 
qualify as an organization described in section 509(a)(1), (2), (3), or 
(4) must be attached to the withholding certificate. An organization 
that provides an opinion of U.S. counsel or an affidavit may provide the 
same opinion or affidavit to more than one withholding agent provided 
that the opinion is acceptable to each withholding agent who receives it 
in conjunction with a withholding certificate. Any such opinion of 
counsel or affidavit must be renewed whenever there is a change in facts 
or circumstances that

[[Page 157]]

are relevant to determine the organization's status under section 501(c) 
or, if relevant, that the organization is or is not a private foundation 
described in section 509.
    (3) Presumptions in the absence of documentation. Notwithstanding 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, if the organization's certification 
with respect to whether amounts paid constitute income includable under 
section 512 in computing the organization's unrelated business taxable 
income is not reliable or is lacking but all other certifications are 
reliable, the withholding agent may rely on the certificate but the 
amounts paid are presumed to be income includable under section 512 in 
computing the organization's unrelated business taxable income. If the 
certification regarding private foundation status is not reliable, the 
withholding agent may rely on the certificate but the amounts paid are 
presumed to be paid to a foreign beneficial owner that is a private 
foundation.
    (4) Reason to know. Reliance by a withholding agent on the 
information and certifications stated on a withholding certificate is 
subject to the agent's actual knowledge or reason to know that such 
information or certification is incorrect as provided in Sec. 1.1441-
7(b). For example, a withholding agent must cease to treat a foreign 
organization's claim for exemption from withholding based on the 
organization's tax-exempt status as valid beginning on the earlier of 
the date on which such agent knows that the IRS has given notice to such 
foreign organization that it is not an organization described in section 
501(c) or the date on which the IRS gives notice to the public that such 
foreign organization is not an organization described in section 501(c). 
Similarly, a withholding agent may no longer rely on a certification 
that an amount is not subject to tax under section 4948 beginning on the 
earlier of the date on which such agent knows that the IRS has given 
notice to such foreign organization that it is subject to tax under 
section 4948 or the date on which the IRS gives notice that such foreign 
organization is a private foundation within the meaning of section 
509(a).
    (c) Failure to receive withholding certificate timely and other 
applicable procedures. See applicable procedures described in Sec. 
1.1441-1(b)(7) in the event the withholding agent does not hold a valid 
withholding certificate or other appropriate documentation at the time 
of payment. Further, the provisions of Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(4) shall apply 
to withholding certificates and other documents related thereto 
furnished under the provisions of this section.
    (d) Effective date--(1) In general. This section applies to payments 
made after December 31, 2000.
    (2) Transition rules. For purposes of this section, the validity of 
a Form W-8, 1001, or 4224 or a statement that was valid on January 1, 
1998, under the regulations in effect prior to January 1, 2001 (see 26 
CFR parts 1 and 35a, revised April 1, 1999) and expired, or will expire, 
at any time during 1998, is extended until December 31, 1998. The 
validity of a Form W-8, 1001, or 4224 or a statement that is valid on or 
after January 1, 1999 remains valid until its validity expires under the 
regulations in effect prior to January 1, 2001 (see 26 CFR parts 1 and 
35a, revised April 1, 1999) but in no event shall such form or statement 
remain valid after December 31, 2000. The rule in this paragraph (d)(2), 
however, does not apply to extend the validity period of a Form W-8, 
1001, or 4224 or a statement that expires solely by reason of changes in 
the circumstances of the person whose name is on the certificate. 
Notwithstanding the first three sentences of this paragraph (d)(2), a 
withholding agent may choose to not take advantage of the transition 
rule in this paragraph (d)(2) with respect to one or more withholding 
certificates valid under the regulations in effect prior to January 1, 
2001 (see 26 CFR parts 1 and 35a, revised April 1, 1999) and, therefore, 
to require withholding certificates conforming to the requirements 
described in this section (new withholding certificates). For purposes 
of this section, a new withholding certificate is deemed to satisfy the 
documentation requirement under the regulations in effect prior to 
January 1, 2001 (see 26 CFR parts 1 and 35a, revised April 1, 1999). 
Further, a new withholding certificate remains valid for the period

[[Page 158]]

specified in Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(4)(ii), regardless of when the 
certificate is obtained.

Sec. 1.1441-10  Withholding agents with respect to fast-pay arrangements.

    (a) In general. A corporation that issues fast-pay stock in a fast-
pay arrangement described in Sec. 1.7701(l)-3(b)(1) is a withholding 
agent with respect to payments made on the fast-pay stock and payments 
deemed made under the recharacterization rules of Sec. 1.7701(l)-3. 
Except as provided in this paragraph (a) or in paragraph (b) of this 
section, the withholding tax rules under section 1441 and section 1442 
apply with respect to a fast-pay arrangement described in Sec. 
1.7701(l)-3(c)(1)(i) in accordance with the recharacterization rules 
provided in Sec. 1.7701(l)-3(c). In all cases, notwithstanding 
paragraph (b) of this section, if at any time the withholding agent 
knows or has reason to know that the Commissioner has exercised the 
discretion under either Sec. 1.7701(l)-3(c)(1)(ii) to apply the 
recharacterization rules of Sec. 1.7701(l)-3(c), or Sec. 1.7701(l)-
3(d) to depart from the recharacterization rules of Sec. 1.7701(l)-3(c) 
for a taxpayer, the withholding agent must withhold on payments made (or 
deemed made) to that taxpayer in accordance with the characterization of 
the fast-pay arrangement imposed by the Commissioner under Sec. 
1.7701(l)-3.
    (b) Exception. If at any time the withholding agent knows or has 
reason to know that any taxpayer entered into a fast-pay arrangement 
with a principal purpose of applying the recharacterization rules of 
Sec. 1.7701(l)-3(c) to avoid tax under section 871(a) or section 881, 
then for each payment made or deemed made to such taxpayer under the 
arrangement, the withholding agent must withhold, under section 1441 or 
section 1442, the higher of--
    (1) The amount of withholding that would apply to such payment 
determined under the form of the arrangement; or
    (2) The amount of withholding that would apply to deemed payments 
determined under the recharacterization rules of Sec. 1.7701(l)-3(c).
    (c) Liability. Any person required to deduct and withhold tax under 
this section is made liable for that tax by section 1461, and is also 
liable for applicable penalties and interest for failing to comply with 
section 1461.(d) Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules 
of this section:

    Example 1. REIT W issues shares of fast-pay stock to foreign 
individual A, a resident of Country C. United States source dividends 
paid to residents of C are subject to a 30 percent withholding tax. W 
issues all shares of benefited stock to foreign individuals who are 
residents of Country D. D's income tax convention with the United States 
reduces the United States withholding tax on dividends to 15 percent. 
Under Sec. 1.7701(l)-3(c), the dividends paid by W to A are deemed to 
be paid by W to the benefited shareholders. W has reason to know that A 
entered into the fast-pay arrangement with a principal purpose of using 
the recharacterization rules of Sec. 1.7701(l)-3(c) to reduce United 
States withholding tax. W must withhold at the 30 percent rate because 
the amount of withholding that applies to the payments determined under 
the form of the arrangement is higher than the amount of withholding 
that applies to the payments determined under Sec. 1.7701(l)-3(c).
    Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1 of this paragraph 
(d) except that W does not know, or have reason to know, that A entered 
into the arrangement with a principal purpose of using the 
recharacterization rules of Sec. 1.7701(l)-3(c) to reduce United States 
withholding tax. Further, the Commissioner has not exercised the 
discretion under Sec. 1.7701(l)-3(d) to depart from the 
recharacterization rules of Sec. 1.7701(l)-3(c). Accordingly, W must 
withhold tax at a 15 percent rate on the dividends deemed paid to the 
benefited shareholders.

    (e) Effective date. This section applies to payments made (or deemed 
made) on or after January 6, 1999.

Sec. 1.1443-1  Foreign tax-exempt organizations.

    (a) Income includible under section 512 in computing unrelated 
business taxable income. In the case of a foreign organization that is 
described in section 501(c), amounts paid to the organization includible 
under section 512 in computing the organization's unrelated business 
taxable income are subject to withholding under Sec. Sec. 1.1441-1, 
1.1441-4, and 1.1441-6 in the same manner as payments of the same 
amounts to any foreign person that is not a tax-exempt organization. 
Therefore, a foreign organization receiving amounts includible under 
section 512 in computing the organization's unrelated business taxable 
income may claim an exemption from withholding or a reduced rate of 
withholding with respect to that income in the same manner as a foreign 
person that is not a tax-exempt organization. See Sec. 1.1441-9(b)(3) 
for presumption that amounts are includible under section 512 in 
computing the organization's unrelated business taxable income in the 
absence of a reliable certification.
    (b) Income subject to tax under section 4948--(1) In general. The 
gross investment income (as defined in section 4940(c)(2)) of a foreign 
private foundation is subject to withholding under section 1443(b) at 
the rate of 4 percent to the extent that the income is from sources 
within the United States and is subject to the tax imposed by section 
4948(a) and the regulations under that section. Withholding under this 
paragraph (b) is required irrespective of the fact that the income may 
be effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the 
United States by the foreign organization. See Sec. 1.1441-9(b)(3) for 
applicable presumptions that amounts are subject to tax under section 
4948. The withholding imposed under this paragraph (b)(1) does not 
obviate a private foundation's obligation to file any return required by 
law with respect to such organization, such as the form that the 
foundation is required to file under section 6033 for the taxable year.
    (2) Reliance on a foreign organization's claim of foreign private 
foundation status. For reliance by a withholding agent on a foreign 
organization's claim of foreign private foundation status, see Sec. 
1.1441-9 (b) and (c).
    (3) Applicable procedures. A withholding agent withholding the 4-
percent amount pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall treat 
such withholding as withholding under section 1441(a) or 1442(a) for all 
purposes, including reporting of the payment on a Form 1042 and a Form 
1042-S pursuant to Sec. 1.1461-1 (b) and (c). Similarly, the foreign 
private foundation shall treat the 4-percent withholding as withholding 
under section 1441(a) or 1442(a), including for purposes of claims for 
refunds and credits.
    (4) Claim of benefits under an income tax treaty. The withholding 
procedures applicable to claims of a reduced rate under an income tax 
treaty are governed solely by the provisions of Sec. 1.1441-6 and not 
by this section.
    (c) Effective date--(1) In general. This section applies to payments 
made after December 31, 2000.
    (2) Transition rules. For purposes of this section, the validity of 
an affidavit or opinion of counsel described in Sec. 1.1443-1(b)(4)(i) 
in effect prior to January 1, 2001 (see Sec. 1.1443-1(b)(4)(i) as 
contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 1999) is extended until 
December 31, 2000. However, a withholding agent may choose to not take 
advantage of the transition rule in this paragraph (c)(2) with respect 
to one or more withholding certificates valid under the regulations in 
effect prior to January

1, 2001 (see 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 1999) and, therefore, to 
require withholding certificates conforming to the requirements

of this section, a new withholding certificate is deemed to satisfy the 
documentation requirement under the regulations in effect prior to 
January 1, 2001 ( see 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 1999). Further, a

interests by foreign persons: In general.

    (a) Purpose and scope of regulations. These regulations set forth 
rules relating to the withholding requirements of section 1445. In 
general, section 1445(a) provides that any person who acquires a U.S. 
real property interest from a foreign person must withhold a tax of 10 
percent from the amount realized by the transferor foreign person (or a 
lesser amount established by agreement with the Internal Revenue 
Service). Section 1445(e) provides special rules requiring withholding 
on distributions and certain other transactions by corporations, 
partnerships, trusts, and estates. This Sec. 1.1445-1 provides general 
rules concerning the withholding requirement of sections 1445(a), as 
well as definitions applicable under both section 1445(a) and 1445(e). 
Section 1.1445-2 provides for various situations in which withholding is 
not required under section 1445(a). Section 1.1445-3 provides for 
adjustments to the amount required to be withheld by transferees under 
section 1445(a). Section 1.1445-4 prescribes the duties of agents in 
transactions subject to withholding under either section 1445(a) or 
1445(e). Section 1.1445-5 provides rules concerning the withholding 
required under section 1445(e), while Sec. 1.1445-6 provides for 
adjustments to the amount required to be withheld under section 1445(e). 
Finally, Sec. 1.1445-7 provides rules concerning the treatment of a 
foreign corporation that has made an election under section 897(i) to be 
treated as a domestic corporation.
    (b) Duty to withhold--(1) In general. Transferees of U.S. real 
property interests are required to deduct and withhold a tax equal to 10 
percent of the amount realized by the transferor, if the transferor is a 
foreign person and the disposition takes place on or after January 1, 
1985. Neither the transferee's duty to withhold nor the amount required 
to be withheld is affected by the amount of cash to be paid by the 
transferee. Amounts withheld must be reported and paid over in 
accordance with the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section. 
Failures to withhold and pay over are subject to the liabilities set 
forth in paragraph (e) of this section. If two or more persons are joint 
transferees of a U.S. real property interest, each such person is 
subject to the obligation to withhold. That obligation is fulfilled with 
respect to each such person if any one of them withholds and pays over 
the required amount in accordance with the rules of this section. If the 
amount realized (as defined in paragraph (g)(5) of this section) by the 
transferor is zero, then no withholding is required. For example, if a 
real property interest is transferred as a gift (i.e, the recipient does 
not assume any liabilities or furnish any other consideration to the 
transferor) then no withholding is required. Withholding is not required 
with respect to dispositions that takes place before January 1, 1985, 
even if the first payment of consideration is made after December 31, 
1984.
    (2) U.S. real property interest owned jointly by foreign and non-
foreign transferors. The amount subject to withholding under paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section with respect to the transfer of a U.S. real 
property interest owned by one or more foreign persons (as defined in 
Sec. 1.897-1(k)) and one or more non-foreign persons shall be 
determined by allocating the amount realized from the transfer between 
(or among) such transferors based upon the capital contribution of each 
transferor with respect to the property and by aggregating the amounts 
allocated to any foreign person (or persons). For this purpose, a 
husband and wife will each

[[Page 161]]

be deemed to have contributed 50 percent of the aggregate capital 
contributed by such husband and wife. See Sec. 1.1445-1(f)(3)(iv) with 
respect to the crediting of the amount withheld between or among joint 
foreign transferors.
    (3) Options to acquire a U.S. real property interest--(i) No 
withholding on grant of option. No withholding is required under section 
1445 with respect to any amount realized by the grantor on the grant of 
an option to acquire a U.S. real property interest.
    (ii) No withholding upon lapse of option. No withholding is required 
under section 1445 with respect to any amount realized by the grantor 
upon the lapse of an option to acquire a U.S. real property interest.
    (iii) Withholding required upon the sale or exchange of option. A 
transferee of an option to acquire a U.S. real property interest must 
deduct and withhold a tax equal to 10 percent of the amount realized by 
the transferor upon the disposition. This Sec. 1.1445-1(b)(3)(iii) does 
not apply to require withholding upon the initial grant of an option.
    (iv) Withholding required on exercise of option. If the holder 
exercises an option to purchase a U.S. real property interest, the 
amount paid for the option shall be considered an amount realized by the 
grantor/transferor upon the transfer of the property with respect to 
which the option was granted, and shall thus be subject to withholding 
on the day that such underlying property is transferred. The preceding 
sentence applies regardless of whether or not the terms of the option 
specifically provide that the option price is applied to the purchase 
price.
    (4) Exceptions and modifications. The duty to withhold under section 
1445(a) is subject to the exceptions and modifications contained in 
Sec. Sec. 1.1445-2 and 1.1445-3. Generally, Sec. 1.1445-2 provides 
rules for determining that withholding is not required because either 
the transferor is not a foreign person or the interest transferred is 
not a U.S. real property interest. In addition, Sec. 1.1445-2 provides 
exceptions to the withholding requirement, including a rule that exempts 
from withholding any person who acquires a U.S. real property interest 
for use as a residence for a contract price of $300,000 or less. If 
withholding is required under section 1445(a), Sec. 1.1445-3 allows the 
amount withheld to be modified pursuant to a withholding certificate 
issued by the Internal Revenue Service. If a transferee cannot withhold 
the full amount required because the first payment of consideration for 
the transfer does not involve sufficient cash (or other liquid assets 
convertible into cash, such as foreign currency), then a withholding 
certificate must be obtained pursuant to Sec. 1.1445-3.
    (c) Reporting and paying over of withheld amounts--(1) In general. A 
transferee must report and pay over any tax withheld by the 20th day 
after the date of the transfer. Forms 8288 and 8288-A are used for this 
purpose, and must be filed at the location as provided in the 
instructions to Forms 8288 and 8288-A. Pursuant to section 7502 and 
regulations thereunder, the timely mailing of Forms 8288 and 8228-A will 
be treated as their timely filing. Form 8288-A will be stamped by the 
IRS to show receipt, and a stamped copy will be mailed by the IRS to the 
transferor (at the address reported on the form) for the transferor's 
use. See Sec. Sec. 1.1445-1(f) and 1.1445-3(f). Forms 8288 and 8288-A 
are required to include the identifying numbers of both the transferor 
and the transferee, as provided in paragraph (d) of this section. If any 
identifying number as required by such forms is not provided, the 
transferee must still report and pay over any tax withheld on Form 8288, 
although the transferor cannot obtain a credit or refund of tax on the 
basis of a Form 8288-A that does not include the transferor's 
identifying number (see paragraph (f)(2) of this section).
    (2) Pending application for withholding certificate--(i) In general. 
(A) Delayed reporting and payment with respect to application submitted 
by transferee. If an application for a withholding certificate with 
respect to a transfer of a U.S. real property interest is submitted to 
the Internal Revenue Service by the transferee on the day of or at any 
time prior to the transfer, the transferee must withhold 10 percent of 
the amount realized as required by paragraph (b) of this section. 
However, the amount withheld, or a lesser amount as

[[Page 162]]

determined by the Service, need not be reported and paid over to the 
Service until the 20th day following the Service's final determination 
with respect to the application for a withholding certificate. For this 
purpose, the Service's final determination occurs on the day when the 
withholding certificate is mailed to the transferee by the Service or 
when a notification denying the request for a withholding certificate is 
mailed to the transferee by the Service. An application is submitted to 
the Service on the day it is actually received by the Service at the 
address provided in Sec. 1.1445-1(g)(10) or, under the rules of section 
7502, on the day it is mailed to the Service at the address provided in 
Sec. 1.1445-1(g)(10).
    (B) Delayed reporting and payment with respect to application 
submitted by transferor. If an application for a withholding certificate 
with respect to a transfer of a U.S. real property interest is submitted 
to the Internal Revenue Service by the Transferor on the day of or any 
time prior to the transfer, such transferor must provide notice to the 
transferee prior to the transfer. No particular form is required but the 
notice must set forth the name, address, and taxpayer identification 
number of the transferor, a brief description of the property which is 
the subject of the application, and the date the application was 
submitted to the Service. The transferee must withhold 10 percent of the 
amount realized as required in paragraph (b) of this section but need 
not report or pay over to the Service such amount (or a lesser amount as 
determined by the Service) until the 20th day following the Service's 
final determination with respect to the application. The Service will 
send a copy of the withholding certificate or copy of the notification 
denying the request for a withholding certificate to the transferee. For 
this purpose, the Service's final determination will be deemed to occur 
on the day when the copy of the withholding certificate or the copy of 
the notification denying the request for a withholding certificate is 
mailed by the Service to the transferee (or transferees). An application 
is submitted to the Service on the day it is actually received by the 
Service at the address provided in Sec. 1.1445-1(g)(10) or, under the 
rules of Sec. 7502, on the day it is mailed to the Service at the 
address provided in Sec. 1.1445-1(g)(10).
    (ii) Anti-abuse rule--(A) In general. A transferee that in reliance 
upon the rules of this paragraph (c)(2) fails to report and pay over 
amounts withheld by the 20th day following the date of the transfer, 
shall be subject to the payment of interest and penalties if the 
relevant application for a withholding certificate (or an amendment to 
the application for a withholding certificate) was submitted for a 
principal purpose of delaying the transferee's payment to the IRS of the 
amount withheld. Interest and penalties shall be assessed on the amount 
that is ultimately paid over (or collected pursuant to the agreement) 
with respect to the period between the 20th day after the date of the 
transfer and the date on which payment is made (or collected).
    (B) Presumption. A principal purpose of delaying payment of the 
amount withheld shall be presumed if--
    (1) The transferee applies for a withholding certificate pursuant to 
Sec. 1.1445-3(c) based on a determination of the transferor's maximum 
tax liability, and
    (2) Such liability is ultimately determined to be equal to 90 
percent or more of the amount that was otherwise required to be withheld 
and paid over. However, the presumption created by the previous sentence 
may be rebutted by evidence establishing that delaying payment of the 
amount withheld was not a principal purpose of the transaction.
    (d) Contents of Forms 8288 and 8288-A--(1) Transactions subject to 
section 1445(a). Any person that is required to file Forms 8288 and 
8288-A pursuant to section 1445(a) and the rules of this section must 
set forth thereon the following information:
    (i) The name, identifying number, and home address (in the case of 
an individual) or office address (in the case of any entity) of the 
transferee(s) filing the return;
    (ii) The name, identifying number, and home address (in the case of 
an individual) or office address (in the case of any entity) of the 
transferor(s);

[[Page 163]]

    (iii) A brief description of the U.S. real property interest 
transferred, including its location and the nature of any substantial 
improvements in the case of real property, and the class or type and 
amount of interests transferred in the case of interests in a 
corporation that constitute U.S. real property interests;
    (iv) The date of the transfer;
    (v) The amount realized by the transferor, as defined in paragraph 
(g)(5) of this section;
    (vi) The amount withheld by the transferee and whether withholding 
is at the statutory or reduced rate; and
    (vii) Such other information as the Commissioner may require.
    For purposes of paragraph (d)(1) (i) and (ii), mailing addresses may 
be provided in addition to, but not in lieu of, home addresses or office 
addresses.
    (2) Transactions subject to section 1445(e). Any person that is 
required to file Forms 8288 and 8288-A pursuant to the rules of Sec. 
1.1445-5 must set forth thereon the following information:
    (i) The name, identifying number, and office address of the entity 
or fiduciary filing the return;
    (ii) The amount withheld by the entity or fiduciary;
    (iii) The date of the transfer;
    (iv) In the case of a transaction subject to withholding pursuant to 
section 1445(e)(1) and Sec. 1.1445-5(c):
    (A) A brief description of the U.S. real property interest 
transferred, as described in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section;
    (B) The name, identifying number, and home address (in the case of 
an individual) or office address (in the case of an entity) of each 
holder of an interest in the entity that is a foreign person; and
    (C) Each such interest-holder's pro rata share of the amount 
withheld;
    (v) In the case of a distribution subject to withholding pursuant to 
section 1445(e)(2) and Sec. 1.1445-5(d):
    (A) A brief description of the U.S. real property interest 
transferred, as described in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section; and
    (B) The amount of gain recognized upon the distribution by the 
corporation.
    (vi) In the case of a distribution subject to withholding pursuant 
to section 1445(e)(3) and Sec. 1.1445-5(e):
    (A) A brief description of the property distributed by the 
corporation;
    (B) The name, identifying number, and home address (in case of an 
individual) or office address (in the case of an entity) of each holder 
of an interest in the entity that is a foreign person;
    (C) The amount realized upon the distribution by each such foreign 
interest holder; and
    (D) Each foreign interest-holder's pro rata share of the amount 
withheld; and
    (vii) Such other information as the Commissioner may require.
    (e) Liability of transferee upon failure to withhold--(1) In 
general. Every person required to deduct and withhold tax under section 
1445 is made liable for that tax by section 1461. Therefore, a person 
that is required to deduct and withhold tax but fails to do so may be 
held liable for the payment of the tax and any applicable penalties and 
interest.
    (2) Transferor's liability not otherwise satisfied--(i) Tax and 
penalties. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, if a 
transferee is required to deduct and withhold tax under section 1445 but 
fails to do so, then the tax shall be assessed against and collected 
from that transferee. Such person may also be subject to any of the 
civil and criminal penalties that apply. Corporate officers or other 
responsible persons may be subject to a civil penalty under section 6672 
equal to the amount that should have been withheld and paid over.
    (ii) Interest. If a transferee is required to deduct and withhold 
tax under section 1445 but fails to do so, then such transferee shall be 
liable for the payment of interest pursuant to section 6601 and the 
regulations thereunder. Interest shall be payable with respect to the 
period between--
    (A) The last date on which the tax imposed under section 1445 was 
required to be paid over by the transferee, and
    (B) The date on which such tax is actually paid. Interest shall be 
payable with respect to the entire amount that is required to be 
deducted and withheld. However, if the Service issues a

[[Page 164]]

withholding certificate providing for withholding of a reduced amount, 
then, for the period after the issuance of the certificate, interest 
shall be payable with respect to that reduced amount.
    (3) Transferor's liability otherwise satisfied--(i) Tax and 
penalties. If a transferee is required to deduct and withhold tax under 
section 1445 but fails to do so, and the transferor's tax liability with 
respect to the transfer was satisfied (or was established to be zero) 
by--
    (A) The transferor's filing of an income tax return (and payment of 
any tax due) with respect to the transfer, or
    (B) The issuance of a withholding certificate by the Internal 
Revenue Service establishing that the transferor's maximum tax liability 
is zero,

then the tax required to be withheld under section 1445 shall not be 
collected from the transferee. Such transferee's liability for tax, and 
the requirement that such person file Forms 8288 and 8288-A, shall be 
deemed to have been satisfied as of the date on which the transferor's 
income tax return was filed or the withholding certificate was issued. 
No penalty shall be imposed on or collected from such person for failure 
to return or pay the tax, unless such failure was fraudulent and for the 
purpose of evading payment. A transferee that seeks to avoid liability 
for tax and penalties pursuant to the rule of paragraph (e)(3)(i) must 
provide sufficient information for the Service to determine whether the 
transferor's tax liability was satisfied (or was established to be 
zero).
    (ii) Interest. If a transferee is required to deduct and withhold 
tax under section 1445 but fails to do so, then such person shall be 
liable for the payment of interest under section 6601 and regulations 
thereunder. Such transferee's liability for the payment of interest 
shall not be excused by reason of the deemed satisfaction, pursuant to 
subdivision (i) of this paragraph (e)(3), of the transferee's liability 
under section 1445, because the deemed satisfaction of that liability is 
the equivalent of the late payment of a liability, on which interest 
must be paid. Interest shall be payable with respect to the period 
between--
    (A) The last date on which the tax imposed under section 1445 was 
required to be paid over, and
    (B) The date (established from information supplied to the Service 
by the transferee) on which any tax due is paid with respect to the 
transferor's relevant income tax return, or the date the withholding 
certificate is issued establishing that the transferor's maximum tax 
liability is zero.

Interest shall be payable with respect to the entire amount that is 
required to be deducted and withheld. However, if the Service issues a 
withholding certificate providing for withholding of a reduced amount, 
then for the period after the issuance of the certificate interest shall 
be payable with respect to that reduced amount.
    (4) Coordination with entity with holding rules. For purposes of 
section 1445(e) and Sec. Sec. 1.1445-5, 1.1445-6, 1.1445-7, and 1.1445-
8T, the rules of this paragraph (e) shall be applied by--
    (i) Substituting the words ``person required to withhold'' for the 
word ``transferee'' each place it appears in this paragraph (e), and
    (ii) Substituting the words ``person subject to withholding'' for 
the word ``transferor'' each place it appears in this paragraph (e).
    (f) Effect of withholding on transferor--(1) In general. The 
withholding of tax under section 1445(a) does not excuse a foreign 
person that disposes of a U.S. real property interest from filing a U.S. 
tax return with respect to the income arising from the disposition. Form 
1040NR, 1041, or 1120F, as appropriate, must be filed, and any tax due 
must be paid, by the filing deadline generally applicable to such 
person. (The return may be filed by such later date as is provided in an 
extension granted by the Internal Revenue Service.) Any tax withheld 
under section 1445(a) shall be credited against the amount of income tax 
as computed in such return.
    (2) Manner of obtaining credit or refund. A stamped copy of Form 
8288-A will be provided to the transferor by the Service (under 
paragraph (c) of this section) if the Form 8288-A is complete, including 
the transferor's identifying number. Except as provided in paragraph 
(f)(3) of this section, a stamped

[[Page 165]]

copy of Form 8288-A must be attached to the transferor's return to 
establish the amount withheld that is available as a credit. If the 
amount withheld under section 1445(a) constitutes less than the full 
amount of the transferor's U.S. tax liability for that taxable year, 
then a payment of estimated tax may be required to be made pursuant to 
section 6154 or 6654 prior to the filing of the income tax return for 
that year. Alternatively, if the amount withheld under section 1445(a) 
exceeds the transferor's maximum tax liability with respect to the 
disposition (as determined by the IRS), then the transferor may seek an 
early refund of the excess pursuant to Sec. 1.1445-3(g), or a normal 
refund upon the filing of a tax return.
    (3) Special rules--(i) Failure to receive Form 8288-A. If a stamped 
copy of Form 8288-A has not been provided to the transferor by the 
Service, the transferor may establish the amount of tax withheld by the 
transferee by attaching to its return substantial evidence (e.g., 
closing documents) of such amount. Such a transferor must attach to its 
return a statement which supplies all of the information required by 
Sec. 1.1445-1(d), including the transferor's identifying number.
    (ii) U.S. persons subjected to withholding. If a transferee 
withholds tax under section 1445(a) with respect to a person who is not 
a foreign person, such person may credit the amount of any tax withheld 
against his income tax liability in accordance with the provisions of 
this Sec. 1.1145-1(f) or apply for an early refund under Sec. 1.1445-
3(g).
    (iii) Refund in case of installment sale. A transferor that takes 
gain into account in accordance with the provisions of section 453 shall 
not be entitled to a refund of the amount withheld, unless a withholding 
certificate providing for such a refund is obtained from the Internal 
Revenue Service pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 1.1445-3.
    (iv) Joint foreign transferors. If two or more foreign persons 
jointly transfer a U.S. real property interest, each transferor shall be 
credited with such portion of the amount withheld as such transferors 
mutually agree. Such transferors must request that the transferee 
reflect the agreed-upon crediting of the amount withheld on the Forms 
8288-A filed by the transferee. If the foreign transferors fail to 
request that the transferee reflect the agreed-upon crediting of the 
amount withheld by the 10th day after the date of transfer, the 
transferee must credit the amount withheld equally between (or among) 
the foreign transferors. In such case, the transferee is indemnified 
pursuant to section 1461 against any claim by a transferor objecting to 
the resulting division of credits. For rules regarding the amount 
realized allocated to joint foreign and non-foreign transferors, see 
Sec. 1.1445-1(b)(2).
    (g) Definitions--(1) In general. Unless otherwise specified, the 
definitions of terms provided in Sec. 1.897-1 shall apply for purposes 
of this section and Sec. Sec. 1.1445-2 through 1.1445-7. For purposes 
of section 1445 and the regulations thereunder, definitions of other 
relevant terms are provided in this paragraph (g). In addition, the term 
``residence'' is defined in 1.1445-2(d)(1), the terms ``transferor's 
agent'' and ``transferee's agent'' are defined in 1.1445-4(f), and the 
term ``relevant taxpayer'' is defined in 1.1445-6(a)(2).
    (2) Transfer. The term ``transfer'' means any transaction that would 
constitute a disposition for any purpose, of the Internal Revenue Code 
and regulations thereunder. For purposes of Sec. Sec. 1.1445-5 and 
1.1445-6, the term includes distribution to shareholders of a 
corporation, partners of a partnership and beneficiaries of a trust or 
estate.
    (3) Transferor. The term ``transferor'' means any person, foreign or 
domestic, that disposes of a U.S. real property interest by sale, 
exchange, gift, or any other transfer. The term ``U.S. real property 
interest'' is defined in Sec. 1.897-1(c).
    (4) Transferee. The term ``transferee'' means any person, foreign or 
domestic, that acquires a U.S. real property interest by purchase, 
exchange, gift, or any other transfer.
    (5) Amount realized. The amount realized by the transferor for the 
transfer of a U.S. real property interest is the sum of.
    (i) The cash paid, or to be paid.
    (ii) The fair market value of other property transferred, or to be 
transferred, and

[[Page 166]]

    (iii) The outstanding amount of any liability assumed by the 
transferee or to which the U.S. real property interest is subject 
immediately before and after the transfer.

The term ``cash paid or to be paid'' does not include stated or unstated 
interest or original issue discount (as determined under the rules of 
sections 1271 through 1275).
    (6) Contract price. The contract price of a U.S. real property 
interest is the sum that is agreed to by the transferee and transferor 
as the total amount of consideration to be paid for the property. That 
amount will generally be equal to the amount realized by the transferor, 
as defined in paragraph (b)(5) of this section.
    (7) Fair market value. The fair market value of property means the 
price at which the property would change hands between an unrelated 
willing buyer and willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to 
buy or to sell and both having reasonable knowledge of all relevant 
facts.
    (8) Date of transfer. The date of transfer of a U.S. real property 
interest is the first date on which consideration is paid (or a 
liability assumed) by the transferee. However, for purposes of section 
1445(e) (2), (3), and (4) and Sec. Sec. 1.1445-5(c)(1)(iii) and 1.1445-
5(c)(3) only, the date of transfer is the date of the distribution that 
gives rise to the obligation to withhold. For purposes of this paragraph 
(g)(8), the payment of consideration does not include the payment, prior 
to the passage of legal or equitable title (other than pursuant to an 
initial contract for purchase), of earnest money, a good-faith deposit, 
or any similar sum that is primarily intended to bind the transferee or 
transferor to the entering or performance of a contract. Such a payment 
will not constitute a payment of consideration solely because it may 
ultimately be applied against the amount owed to the transferor by the 
transferee. Such a payment is presumed to be earnest money, a good faith 
deposit, or a similar sum if it is subject to forfeiture in the event of 
a failure to enter into a contract or a breach of contract. However, a 
payment that is not forefeitable may nevertheless be found to constitute 
earnest money, a good faith deposit, or a similar sum.
    (9) Identifying number. Pursuant to Sec. 1.897-1(p), an 
individual's identifying number is the social security number or the 
identification number assigned by the Internal Revenue Service (see 
Sec. 301.6109-1 of this chapter). The identifying number of any other 
person is its United States employer identification number.
    (10) Address of the Director, Philadelphia Service Center. Any 
written communication directed to the Director, Philadelphia Service 
Center is to be addressed as follows: P.O. Box 21086, Drop Point 8731,

Sec. 1.1445-2  Situations in which withholding is not required under 
section 1445(a).

    (a) Purpose and scope of section. This section provides rules 
concerning various situations in which withhold is not required under 
section 1445(a). In general, a transferee has a duty to withhold under 
section 1445(a) only if both of the following are true:
    (1) The transferor is a foreign person; and
    (2) The transferee is acquiring a U.S. real property interest.

Thus, paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section provide rules under which a 
transferee of property can ascertain that he has no duty to withhold 
because one or the other of the two key elements is missing. Under 
paragraph (b), a transferee may determine that no withholding is 
required because the transferor is not a foreign person. Under paragraph 
(c), a transferee may determine that no withholding is required because 
the property acquired is not a U.S. real property interest. Finally,

[[Page 167]]

paragraph (d) of this section provides rules concerning exceptions to 
the withholding requirement.
    (b) Transferor not a foreign person--(1) In general. No withholding 
is required under section 1445 if the transferor of a U.S. real property 
interest is not a foreign person. Therefore, paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section provides rules pursuant to which the transferor can provide a 
certification of non-foreign status to inform the transferee that 
withholding is not required. A transferee that obtains such a 
certification must retain that document for five years, as provided in 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Except to the extent provided in 
paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the obtaining of this certification 
excuses the transferee from any liability otherwise imposed by section 
1445 and Sec. 1.1445-1(e). However, section 1445 and the rules of this 
section do not impose any obligation upon a transferee to obtain a 
certification from the transferor, thus, a transferee may instead rely 
upon other means to ascertain the non-foreign status of the transferor. 
If, however, the transferee relies upon other means and the transferor 
was, in fact, a foreign person, then the transferee is subject to the 
liability imposed by section 1445 and Sec. 1.1445-1(e).


A transferee is in no event required to rely upon other means to 
ascertain the non-foreign status of the transferor and may demand a 
certification of non-foreign status. If the certification is not 
provided, the transferee may withhold tax under section 1445 and will be 
considered, for purposes of sections 1461 through 1463, to have been 
required to withhold such tax.
    (2) Transferor's certification of non-foreign status--(i) In 
general. A transferee of a U.S. real property interest is not required 
to withhold under section 1445(a) if, prior to or at the time of the 
transfer, the transferor furnishes to the transferee a certification 
that--
    (A) States that the transferor is not a foreign person.
    (B) Sets forth the transferor's name, identifying number and home 
address (in the case of an individual) or office address (in the case of 
an entity), and
    (C) Is signed under penalties of perjury.

In general, a foreign person is a nonresident alien individual, foreign 
corporation, foreign partnership, foreign trust, or foreign estate, but 
not a resident alien individual. In this regard, see Sec. 1.897-1(k). 
However, a foreign corporation that has made a valid election under 
section 897(i) is generally not treated as a foreign person for purposes 
of section 1445. In this regard, see Sec. 1.1445-7. Pursuant to Sec. 
1.897-1(p), an individual's identifying number is the individual's 
Social Security number and any other person's identifying number is its 
U.S. employer identification number. A certification pursuant to this 
paragraph (b) must be vertified as true and signed under penalties of 
perjury by a responsible officer in the case of a corporation, by a 
general partner in the case of a partnership, and by a trustee, 
executor, or equivalent fiduciary in the case of a trust or estate. No 
particular form is needed for a certification pursuant to this paragraph 
(b), nor is any particular language required, so long as the document 
meets the requirements of this paragraph (b)(2)(i). Samples of 
acceptable certifications are provided in paragraph(b)(2)(iii) of this 
section.
    (ii) Foreign corporation that ``has made election under section 
897(i). A foreign corporation that has made a valid election under 
section 897(i) to be treated as a domestic corporation for purposes of 
section 897 may provide a certification of non-foreign status pursuant 
to this paragraph (b)(2). However, an electing foreign corporation must 
attach to such certification a copy of the acknowledgment of the 
election provided to the corporation by the Internal Revenue Service 
pursuant to Sec. 1.897-3(d)(4).

An acknowledgment is valid for this purpose only if it states that the 
information required by Sec. 1.897-3 has been determined to be 
complete.
    (iii) Disregarded entities. A disregarded entity may not certify 
that it is the transferor of a U.S. real property interest, as the 
disregarded entity is not the transferor for U.S. tax purposes, 
including sections 897 and 1445. Rather, the owner of the disregarded 
entity is treated as the transferor of property and must provide a 
certificate

[[Page 168]]

of non-foreign status to avoid withholding under section 1445. A 
disregarded entity for these purposes means an entity that is 
disregarded as an entity separate from its owner under Sec. 301.7701-3 
of this chapter, a qualified REIT subsidiary as defined in section 
856(i), or a qualified subchapter S subsidiary under section 
1361(b)(3)(B). Any domestic entity must include in its certification of 
non-foreign status with respect to the transfer a certification that it 
is not a disregarded entity. This paragraph (b)(2)(iii) and the sample 
certification provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section (to 
the extent it addresses disregarded entities) is applicable for 
dispositions occurring September 4, 2003.
    (iv) Sample certifications--(A) Individual transferor.

    ``Section 1445 of the Internal Revenue Code provides that a 
transferee (buyer) of a U.S. real property interest must withhold tax if 
the transferor (seller) is a foreign person. To inform the transferee 
(buyer) that withholding of tax is not required upon my disposition of a 
U.S. real property interest, I, [name of transferor], hereby certify the 
following:
    1. I am not a nonresident alien for purposes of U.S. income 
taxation;
    2. My U.S. taxpayer identifying number [Social Security number] is 
--------; and
    3. My home address is:
________________________________________________________________________

________________________________________________________________________
    I understand that this certification may be disclosed to the 
Internal Revenue Service by the transferee and that any false statement 
I have made here could be punished by fine, imprisonment, or both.
    Under penalties of perjury I declare that I have examined this 
certification and to the best of my knowledge and belief it is true, 
correct, and complete. [Signature and Date]''

    (B) Entity transferor.

    ``Section 1445 of the Internal Revenue Code provides that a 
transferee of a U.S. real property interest must withhold tax if the 
transferor is a foreign person. For U.S. tax purposes (including section 
1445), the owner of a disregarded entity (which has legal title to a 
U.S. real property interest under local law) will be the transferor of 
the property and not the disregarded entity. To inform the transferee 
that withholding of tax is not required upon the disposition of a U.S. 
real property interest by [name of transferor] , the undersigned hereby 
certifies the following on behalf of [name of the transferor]:
    1. [Name of transferor] is not a foreign corporation, foreign 
partnership, foreign trust, or foreign estate (as those terms are 
defined in the Internal Revenue Code and Income Tax Regulations);
    2. [Name of transferor] is not a disregarded entity as defined in 
Sec. 1.1445-2(b)(2)(iii);
    3. [Name of transferor]'s U.S. employer identification number is --
----; and
    4. [Name of transferor]'s office address is --------------.
    [Name of transferor] understands that this certification may be 
disclosed to the Internal Revenue Service by transferee and that any 
false statement contained herein could be punished by fine, 
imprisonment, or both.
    Under penalties of perjury I declare that I have examined this 
certification and to the best of my knowledge and belief it is true, 
correct, and complete, and I further declare that I have authority to 
sign this document on behalf of [name of transferor].

[Signature(s) and date]

[Title(s)]''

    (3) Transferee must retain certification. If a transferee obtains a 
transferor's certification pursuant to the rules of this paragraph (b), 
then the transferee must retain that certification until the end of the 
fifth taxable year following the taxable year in which the transfer 
takes place. The transferee must retain the certification, and make it 
avaliable to the Internal Revenue Service when requested in accordance 
with the requirements of section 6001 and regulations thereunder.
    (4) Reliance upon certification not permitted--(i) In general. A 
transferee may not rely upon a transferor's certification pursuant to 
this paragraph (b) under the circumstances set forth in either 
subdivision (ii) or (iii) of this paragraph (b)(4). In either of those 
circumstances, a transferee's withholding obligation shall apply as if a 
certification had never been obtained, and the transferee is fully 
liable pursuant to section 1445 and Sec. 1.1445-1(e) for any failure to 
withhold.
    (ii) Failure to attach IRS acknowledgment of election. A transferee 
that knows that the transferor is a foreign corporation may not rely 
upon a certification of non-foreign status provided by the corporation 
on the basis of election under section 897(i), unless there is attached 
to the certification a

[[Page 169]]

copy of the acknowledgment by the Internal Revenue Service of the 
corporation's election, as required by paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this 
section.
    (iii) Knowledge of falsity. A transferee is not entitled to rely 
upon a transferor's certification if prior to or at the time of the 
transfer the transferee either--
    (A) Has actual knowledge that the transferor's certification is 
false; or
    (B) Receives a notice that the certification is false from a 
transferor's or transferee's agent, pursuant to Sec. 1.1445-4.
    (iv) Belated notice of false certification. If after the date of the 
transfer a transferee receives a notice that a certification is false, 
then that transferee is entitled to rely upon the certification only 
with respect to consideration that was paid prior to receipt for the 
notice. Such a transferee is required to withhold a full 10 percent of 
the amount realized from the consideration that remains to be paid to 
the transferor if possible. Thus, if 10 percent or more of the amount 
reailzed remains to be paid to the transferor then the transferee is 
required to withhold and pay over the full 10 percent. The transferee 
must do so by withholding and paying over the entire amount of each 
successive payment of consideration to the transferor until the full 10 
percent of the amount realized has been withheld and paid over. Amounts 
so withheld must be reported and paid over by the 20th day following the 
date on which each such payment of consideration is made. A transferee 
that is subject to the rules of this paragraph (b)(4)(iv) may not obtain 
a withholding certificate pursuant to Sec. 1.1445-3, but must instead 
withhold and pay over the amounts required by this paragraph.
    (c) Transferred property not a U.S. real property interest--(1) In 
general. No withholding is required under section 1445 if the transferee 
acquires only property that is not a U.S. real property interest. As 
defined in section 897(c) and Sec. 1.897-1(c), a U.S. real property 
interest includes certain interests in U.S. corporations, as well as 
direct interests in real property and certain associated personal 
property. This paragraph (c) provides rules pursuant to which a person 
acquiring an interest in a U.S. corporation may determine that 
withholding is not required because that interest is not a U.S. real 
property interest. To determine whether an interest in tangible property 
constitutes a U.S. real property interest the acquisition of which would 
be subject to withholding, see Sec. 1.897-1 (b) and (c).
    (2) Interests in publicly traded entities. No withholding is 
required under section 1445(a) upon the acquisition of an interest in a 
domestic corporation if any class of stock of the corporation is 
regularly traded on an established securities market.

This exemption shall apply if the disposition is incident to an initial 
public offering of stock pursuant to a registration statement filed with 
the Securities and Exchange Commission. Similarly, no withholding is 
required under section 1445(a) upon the acquisition of an interest in a 
publicly traded partnership or trust. However, the rule of this 
paragraph (c)(2) shall not apply to the acquisition, from a single 
transferor in a single (or related transferors (as defined in Sec. 
1.897-1(i)) transaction (or related transactions), of an interest 
described in Sec. 1.897-1(c)(2)(iii)(B) (relating to substantial 
amounts of non-publicly traded interests in publicly traded 
corporations) or to similar interests in publicly traded partnerships or 
trusts. The person making an acquisition described in the preceding 
sentence must otherwise determine whether withholding is required, 
pursuant to section 1445 and the regulations thereunder. Transactions 
shall be deemed to be related if they are undertaken within 90 days of 
one another or if it can otherwise be shown that they were undertaken in 
pursuance of a prearranged plan.
    (3) Transferee receives statement that interest in corporation is 
not a U.S. real property interest--(i) In general. No withholding is 
required under section 1445(a) upon the acquisition of an interest in a 
domestic corporation, if the tranferor provides the transferee with a 
copy of a statement, issued by the corporation pursuant to Sec. 1.897-
2(h), certifying that the interest is not a U.S. real property interest. 
In general, a corporation may issue such a statement only if the 
corporation was not a

[[Page 170]]

U.S. real property holding corporation at any time during the previous 
five years (or the period in which the interest was held by its present 
holder, if shorter) or if interests in the corporation ceased to be 
United States real property interests under section 897(c)(1)(B). (A 
corporation may not provide such a statement based on its determination 
that the interest in question is an interest solely as a creditor). See 
Sec. 1.897-2 (f) and (h). The corporation may provide such a statement 
directly to the transferee at the transferor's request. The transferor 
must request such a statement prior to the transfer, and shall, to the 
extent possible, specify the anticipated date of the transfer. A 
corporation's statement may be relied upon for purposes of this 
paragraph (c)(3) only if the statement is dated not more than 30 days 
prior to the date of the transfer. A transferee may also rely upon a 
corporation's statement that is voluntarily provided by the corporation 
in response to a request from the transferee, if that statement 
otherwise complies with the requirements of this paragraph (c)(3) and 
Sec. 1.897-2(h).
    (ii) Reliance on statement not permitted. A transferee is not 
entitled to rely upon a statement that a corporation is not a U.S. real 
property holding corporation if, prior to or at the time of the 
transfer, the transferee either--
    (A) Has actual knowledge that the statement is false, or
    (B) Receives a notice that the statement is false from a 
transferor's or transferee's agent, pursuant to Sec. 1.1445-4.

Such a transferee's withholding obligations shall apply as if a 
statement had never been given, and such a transferee may be held fully 
liable pursuant to Sec. 1.1445-1(e) for any failure to withhold.
    (iii) Belated notice of false statement. If after the date of the 
transfer, a transferee receives notice that a statement provided under 
Sec. 1.1445-2(c)(3)(i) (that an interest in a corporation is not a U.S. 
real property interest) is false, then such transferee may rely on the 
statement only with respect to consideration that was paid prior to the 
receipt of the notice.

Such a transferee is required to withhold a full 10 percent of the 
amount realized from the consideration that remains to be paid to the 
transferor, if possible. Thus, if 10 percent or more of the amount 
realized remains to be paid to the transferor, then the transferee is 
required to withhold and pay over the full 10 percent. The transferee 
must do so by withholding and paying over the entire amount of each 
successive payment of consideration to the transferor, until the full 10 
percent of the amount realized has been withheld and paid over. Amounts 
so withheld must be reported and paid over by the 20th day following the 
date on which each such payment of consideration is made. A transferee 
that is subject to the rules of this Sec. 1.1445-2(c)(3)(iii) may not 
obtain a withholding certificate pursuant to Sec. 1.1445-3, but must 
instead withhold and pay over the amounts required by this paragraph.
    (d) Exceptions to requirement of withholding--(1) Purchase of 
residence for $300,000 or less. No withholding is required under section 
1445(a) if one or more individual transferees acquire a U.S. real 
property interest for use as a residence and the amount realized on the 
transaction is $300,000 or less. For purposes of this section, a U.S. 
real property interest is acquired for use as a residence if on the date 
of the transfer the transferee (or transferees) has definite plans to 
reside at the property for at least 50 percent of the number of days 
that the property is used by any person during each of the first two 12-
month periods following the date of the transfer. The number of days 
that the property will be vacant is not taken into account in 
determining the number of days such property is used by any person. A 
transferee shall be considered to reside at a property on any day on 
which a member of the transferee's family, as defined in section 
267(c)(4), resides at the property. No form or other document need be 
filed with the Internal Revenue Service to establish a transferee's 
entitlement to rely upon the exception provided by this paragraph 
(d)(1). A transferee who fails to withhold in reliance upon this 
exception, but who does not in fact reside at the property for the 
minimum number of days set forth above, shall be liable for the failure 
to withhold (if the transferor was a foreign person and

[[Page 171]]

did not pay the full U.S. tax due on any gain recognized upon the 
transfer). However, if the transferee establishes that the failure to 
reside the minimum number of days was caused by a change in 
circumstances that could not reasonably have been anticipated at the 
time of the transfer, then the transferee shall not be liable for the 
failure to withhold.

The exception provided by paragraph (d)(1) does not apply in any case 
where the transferee is other than an individual even if the property is 
acquired for or on behalf of an individual who will use the property as 
a residence. However, this exception applies regardless of the 
organizational structure of the transferor (i.e., regardless of whether 
the transferor is an individual, partnership, trust, corporation, etc.).
    (2) Coordination with nonrecognition provisions--(i) In general. A 
transferee shall not be required to withhold under section 1445(a) with 
respect to the transfer of a U.S. real property interest if--
    (A) The transferor notifies the transferee, in the manner described 
in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section, that by reason of the 
operation of a nonrecognition provision of the Internal Revenue Code or 
the provisions of any United States treaty the transferor is not 
required to recognize any gain or loss with respect to the transfer, and
    (B) By the 20th day after the date of the transfer the transferee 
provides a copy of the transferor's notice to the Director, Philadelphia 
Service Center, at the address provided in Sec. 1.1445-1(g)(10), 
together with a cover letter setting forth the name, identifying number, 
and home address (in the case of an individual) or office address (in 
the case of an entity) of the transferee providing the notice to the 
Service. The rule of this paragraph (d)(2)(i) is subject to the 
exceptions set forth in paragraph (d)(2)(ii). For purposes of this 
paragraph (d)(2) a nonrecognition provision is any provision of the 
Internal Revenue Code for not recognizing gain or loss.
    (ii) Exceptions. A transferee may not rely upon the rule of 
paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, and must therefore withhold under 
section 1445(a) with respect to the transfer of a U.S. real property 
interest, if either:
    (A) The transferor qualifies for nonrecognition treatment with 
respect to part, but not all, of the gain realized by the transferor 
upon the transfer, or
    (B) The transferee knows or has reason to know that the transferor 
is not entitled to the nonrecognition treatment claimed by the 
transferor.

In either of the above circumstances the transferee or transferor may 
request a withholding certificate from the Internal Revenue Service 
pursuant to the rules of Sec. 1.1445-3.
    (iii) Contents of the notice. No particular form is required for a 
transferor's notice to a transferee that the transferor is not required 
to recognize gain or loss with respect to a transfer. The notice must be 
verified as true and signed under penalties of perjury by the 
transferor, by a responsible officer in the case of a corporation, by a 
general partner in the case of a partnership, and by a trustee or 
equivalent fiduciary in the case of a trust or estate. The following 
information must be set forth in paragraphs labeled to correspond with 
the designation set forth as follows--
    (A) A statement that the document submitted constitutes a notice of 
a nonrecognition transaction or a treaty provision pursuant to the 
requirements of Sec. 1.1445-2(d)(2);
    (B) The name, identifying number, and home address (in the case of 
an individual) or office address (in the case of an entity) of the 
transferor submitting the notice;
    (C) A statement that the transferor is not required to recognize any 
gain or loss with respect to the transfer;
    (D) A brief description of the transfer; and
    (E) A brief summary of the law and facts supporting the claim that 
recognition of gain or loss is not required with respect to the 
transfer.
    (iv) No notice allowed. The provisions of this paragraph (d)(2) do 
not apply to exclusions from income under section 121, to simultaneous 
like-kind exchanges under section 1031 that do not qualify for 
nonrecognition treatment in their entirety (see paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) 
of this section), and to non-simultaneous like-kind exchanges

[[Page 172]]

under section 1031 where the transferee cannot determine that the 
exchange has been completed and all the conditions for nonrecognition 
have been satisfied at the time it is otherwise required to pay the 
section 1445 withholding tax and file the withholding tax return (Form 
8288, ``U.S. Withholding Tax Return for Dispositions by Foreign Persons 
of U.S. Real Property Interests''). In these cases, the transferee is 
excused from withholding only upon the timely application for and 
receipt of a withholding certificate under Sec. 1.1445-3 (see Sec. 
1.1445-3(b)(5) and (6) for specific rules applicable to transactions 
under sections 121 and 1031). This paragraph (d)(2)(iv) is applicable 
for dispositions and exchanges occurring September 4, 2003.
    (3) Special procedural rules applicable to foreclosures--(i) Amount 
to be withheld--(A) foreclosures. A transferee that acquires a U.S. real 
property interest pursuant to a repossession or foreclosure on such 
property under a mortgage, security agreement, deed of trust or other 
instrument securing a debt must withhold tax under section 1445(a) equal 
to 10 percent of the amount realized on such sale. Such amount must be 
reported and paid over to the Service under the general rules of Sec. 
1.1445-1. However, if the transferee complies with the notice 
requirements of Sec. 1.1445-2(d)(3) (ii) and (iii), such transferee may 
report and pay over to the Service on or before the 20th day following 
the final determination by a court or trustee with jurisdiction over the 
foreclosure action, the lesser of:
    (1) The amount otherwise required to be withheld under section 
1445(a), or
    (2) The ``alternative amount'' as defined in the succeeding 
sentence. The alternative amount is the entire amount, if any, 
determined by a court or trustee with jurisdiction over the matter, that 
accrues to the debtor/transferor out of the amount realized from the 
foreclosure sale. The amount of any mortgage, lien, or other security 
agreement secured by the property, that is terminated, assumed by 
another person, or otherwise extinguished (as to the debtor/transferor) 
shall not be treated as an amount that accrues to the debtor/transferor 
for purposes of this Sec. 1.1445-2(d)(3)(i)(A). If the alternative 
amount is zero, no withholding is required. Any difference between the 
amount withheld at the time of the foreclosure sale and the amount to be 
reported and paid over to the Service must be transferred to the court 
or trustee with jurisdiction over the foreclosure action. Amounts 
withheld, if any, are to be reported and paid to the Service by using 
Forms 8288 and 8288-A in conformity with Sec. 1.1445-1(d).
    (B) Deeds in lieu of foreclosures. A transferee of a U.S. real 
property interest pursuant to a deed in lieu of foreclosure must 
withhold tax equal to 10 percent of the amount realized by the debtor/
transferor on the transfer. However, no withholding is required if:
    (1) The transferee is the only person with a security interest in 
the property,
    (2) No cash or other property (other than incidental fees incurred 
with respect to the transfer) is paid, directly or indirectly, to any 
person with respect to the transfer, and
    (3) The notice requirement of Sec. 1.1445-2(d)(3) are satisfied.

The amount withheld, if any, must be reported and paid over to the 
Service not later than the 20th day following the date of transfer. In a 
case where withholding would otherwise be required, a withholding 
certificate may be requested in accordance with Sec. 1.1445-3.
    (ii) Notice to the court or trustee in a foreclosure action--(A) 
Notice on day of purchase. A transferee in a foreclosure sale that 
chooses to use the special rules applicable to foreclosures must provide 
notice to the court or trustee with jurisdiction over the foreclosure 
action on the day the property is transferred with respect to such 
transferee's withholding obligation. No particular form is necessary but 
the notice must set forth the transferee's name, home address in the 
case of an individual, office address in the case of an entity, a brief 
description of the property, the date of the transfer, the amount 
realized on the sale of the foreclosed property and the amount withheld 
under section 1445(a).
    (B) Notice whether amount withheld or alternative amount is reported 
and paid over to the Service. A purchaser/transferee in a foreclosure 
that chooses to

[[Page 173]]

use the special rules applicable to foreclosures must provide notice to 
the court or trustee with jurisdiction over the foreclosure action 
regarding whether the amount withheld or the alternative amount will be 
(or has been) reported and paid over to the Service. The notice should 
set forth all the information required by the preceding paragraph 
(d)(3)(ii)(A), the amount withheld or alternative amount that will be 
(or has been) reported and paid over to the Service, and the amount that 
will be (or has been) paid over to the court or trustee.
    (iii) Notice to the Service--(A) General rule. A transferee that in 
reliance upon the rules of this paragraph (d)(3) withholds an 
alternative amount (or does not withhold because the alternative amount 
is zero) must, on or before the 20th day following the final 
determination by a court or trustee in a foreclosure action or on or 
before the 20th day following the date of the transfer with respect to a 
transfer pursuant to a deed in lieu of foreclosure, provide notice 
thereof to the Assistant Commissioner (International) at the address 
provided in Sec. 1.1445-1(g)(10). (The filing of such a notice shall 
not relieve a creditor of any obligation it may have to file a notice 
pursuant to section 6050J and the regulations thereunder.) No particular 
form is required but the following information must be set forth in 
paragraphs labelled to correspond with the numbers set forth below.
    (1) A statement that the notice constitutes a notice of foreclosure 
action or transfer pursuant to a deed in lieu of foreclosure under Sec. 
1.1445-2(d)(3).
    (2) The name, identifying number, and home address (in the case of 
an individual) or office address (in the case of an entity) of the 
purchaser/transferee.
    (3) The name, identifying number, and home address (in the case of 
an individual) or office address (in the case of an entity) of the 
debor/transferor.
    (4) In a foreclosure action, the date of the final determination by 
a court or trustee regarding the distribution of the amount realized 
from the foreclosure sale. In a transfer pursuant to a deed in lieu of 
foreclosure, the date the property is transferred to the purchaser/
transferee.
    (5) A brief description of the property.
    (6) The amount realized from the foreclosure sale or with respect to 
the transfer pursuant to a deed in lieu of foreclosure.
    (7) The alternative amount.
    (B) Special rule for lenders required to file Form 1099-A where the 
alternative amount is zero. A person required under section 6050J to 
file Form 1099-A does not have to comply with the notice requirement of 
Sec. 1.1445-2(d)(3)(iii)(A) if the alternative amount is zero. In such 
case, the filing of the Form 1099-A will be deemed to satisfy the notice 
requirments of Sec. 1.1445-2(d)(3)(iii)(A).
    (iv) Requirements not applicable. A transferee is not required to 
withhold tax or provide notice pursuant to the rules of this paragraph 
(d)(3) if no substantive withholding liability applies to the transfer 
of the property by the debtor/transferor. For example, if the debtor/
transferor provides the transferee with a certification of non-foreign 
status pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, then no substantive 
withholding liability would exist with respect to the acquisition of the 
property from the debtor transferor. In such a case, no withholding of 
tax or notice to the Internal Revenue Service is required of the 
transferee with respect to the repossession or foreclosure.
    (v) Anti-abuse rule. If a U.S. real property interest is transferred 
in foreclosure or pursuant to a deed in lieu of foreclosure for a 
principal purpose of avoiding the requirements of section 1445(a), then 
the provisions of this paragraph (d)(3) shall not apply to the transfer 
and the transferee shall be fully liable for any failure to withhold 
with respect to the transfer. A principal purpose to avoid section 
1445(a) will be presumed (subject to rebuttal on the basis of all 
relevant facts and circumstances) if:
    (A) The transferee acquires property in which it, or a related 
party, has a security interest;
    (B) The security interest did not arise in connection with the 
debtor/transferor's or a related party's or predecessor in interest's 
acquisition,

[[Page 174]]

improvement, or maintenance of the property; and
    (C) The total amount of all debts secured by the property exceeds 90 
percent of the fair market value of the property.
    (4) Installment payments. A transferee of a U.S. real property 
interest is not required to withhold under section 1445 when making 
installment payments on an obligation arising out of a dispositions that 
took place before January 1, 1985. With respect to disposition that take 
place after December 31, 1984, the transferee shall be required to 
satisfy its entire withholding obligation within the time specified in 
Sec. 1.1445-1(c) regardless of the amount actually paid by the 
transferee. Thereafter, no withholding is required upon further 
installment payments on an obligation arising out of the transfer. A 
transferee that is unable to satisfy its entire withholding obligation 
within the time specified in Sec. 1.1445-1(c) may request a withholding 
certificate pursuant to Sec. 1.1445-3.
    (5) Acquisitions by governmental bodies. No withholding of tax is 
required under section 1445 with respect to any acquisition of property 
by the United States, a state or possession of the United States, a 
political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia.
    (6) [Reserved]
    (7) Withholding certificate obtained by transferee or transferor. No 
withholding is required under section 1445(a) if the transferee is 
provided with a withholding cerfiticate that so specifies. Either the 
transferor or the transferee may seek a withholding certificate from the 
Internal Revenue Service, pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 1.1445-3.
    (8) Amount realized by transferor is zero. If the amount realized by 
transferor on a transfer of a U.S. real property interest is zero, no 
withholding is required.
    (e) Effective date for taxpayer identification numbers. The 
requirement in paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(B), (d)(2)(iii)(B), and 
(d)(3)(iii)(A)(2) and (3) of this section that taxpayer identification 
numbers be provided (in all cases) is applicable for dispositions of 
U.S. real property interests occurring after November 3, 2003.

Sec. 1.1445-3  Adjustments to amount required to be withheld pursuant 
to withholding certificate.

    (a) In general. Withholding under section 1445(a) may be reduced or 
eliminated pursuant to a withholding certificate issued by the Internal 
Revenue Service in accordance with the rules of this section. A 
withholding certificate may be issued by the Service in cases where 
reduced withholding is appropriate (see paragraph (c) of this section), 
where the transferor is exempt from U.S. tax (see paragraph (d) of this 
section), or where an agreement for the payment of tax is entered into 
with the Service (see paragraph (e) of this section). A withholding 
certificate that is obtained prior to a transfer notifies the transferee 
that no withholding is required. A withholding certificate that is 
obtained after a transfer has been made may authorize a normal refund or 
an early refund pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section. Either a 
transferee or transferor may apply for a withholding certificate. The 
Internal Revenue Service will act upon an application for a withholding 
certificate not later than the 90th day after it is received. Solely for 
this purpose (i.e., determining the day upon which the 90-day period 
commences), an application is received by the Service on the date that 
all information necessary for the Service to make a determination is 
provided by the applicant. In no event, however, will a withholding 
certificate be issued without the transferor's identifying number. (For 
rules regarding whether an application for a withholding certificate has 
been timely submitted, see Sec. 1.445-1(c)(2).) The Service may deny a 
request for a withholding certificate where, after due notice, an 
applicant fails to provide information necessary for the Service to make 
a determination. The Service will act upon an application for an early 
refund not later than the 90th day after it is received. An application

[[Page 175]]

for an early refund must either (1) include a copy of a withholding 
certificate issued by the Service with respect to the transaction or, 
(2) be combined with an application for a withholding certificate. Where 
an application for an early refund is combined with an application for a 
withholding certificate, the Service will act upon both applications not 
later than the 90th day after receipt. In the case of an application for 
a certificate based on non-conforming secuirty under paragraph (e)(3)(v) 
of this section, and in unusually complicated cases, the Service may be 
unable to provide a final withholding certificate by the 90th day. In 
such a case the Service will notify the applicant, by the 45th day after 
receipt of the application, that additional processing time will be 
necessary. The Service's notice may request additional information or 
explanation concerning particular aspects of the application, and will 
provide a target date for final action (contingent upon the 
application's timely submission of any requested information). A 
withholding certificate issued pursuant to the provisions of this 
section serves to fulfill the requirements of section 1445(b)(4) 
concerning qualifying statements, section 1445(c)(1) concerning the 
transferor's maximum tax liability, or section 1445(c)(2) concerning the 
Secretary's authority to prescribe reduced withholding.
    (b) Applications for withholding certificates--(1) In general. An 
application for a withholding certificate must be submitted to the 
Director, Philadelphia Service Center, at the address provided in Sec. 
1.1445-1(g)(10). An application for a withholding certificate must be 
signed by a responsible officer in the case of a corporation, by a 
general partner in the case of a partnership, by a trustee, executor, or 
equivalent fiduciary in the case of a trust or estate, and in the case 
of an individual by the individual himself. A duly authorized agent may 
sign the application but the application must contain a valid power of 
attorney authorizing the agent to sign the application on behalf of the 
applicant. The person signing the application must verify under 
penalties of perjury that all representations made in connection with 
the application are true, correct, and complete to his knowledge and 
belief. No particular form is required for an application, but the 
application must set forth the information described in paragraphs (b), 
(2), (3), and (4), and to the extent applicable, paragraph (b)(5) or (6) 
of this section.
    (2) Parties to the transaction. The application must set forth the 
name, address, and identifying number of the person submitting the 
application (specifying whether that person is the transferee or 
transferor), and the name, address, and identifying number of other 
parties to the transaction (specifying whether each such party is a 
transferee or transferor). The Service will deny the application if 
complete information, including the identifying numbers of all the 
parties, is not provided. Thus, for example, the applicant should 
determine if an identifying number exists for each party, and, if none 
exists for a particular party, the applicant should notify the 
particular party of the obligation to get an identifying number before 
the application can be submitted to the Service. The address provided in 
the case of an individual must be that individual's home address, and 
the address provided in the case of an entity must be that entity's 
office address. A mailing address may be provided in addition to, but 
not in lieu of, a home address or office address.
    (3) Real property interest to be transferred. The application must 
set forth information concerning the U.S. real property interest with 
respect to which the withholding certificate is sought, including the 
type of interest, the contract price, and, in the case of an interest in 
real property, its location and general description, or in the case of 
an interest in a U.S. real property holding corporation, the class or 
type and amount of the interest.
    (4) Basis for certificate--(i) Reduced withholding. If a withholding 
certificate is sought on the basis of a claim that reduced withholding 
in appropriate, the application must include:
    (A) A calculation of the maximum tax that may be imposed on the 
disposition in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Such 
calculation must be accompanied by a copy of the

[[Page 176]]

relevant contract and depreciation schedules or other evidence that 
confirms the contract price and adjusted basis of the property. If no 
depreciation schedules are provided, the application must state the 
nature of the use of the property and why depreciation was not 
allowable. Evidence that supports any claimed adjustment to the maximum 
tax on the disposition must also be provided;
    (B) A calculation of the transferor's unsatisfied withholding 
liability, or evidence supporting the claim that no such liability 
exists, in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section; and
    (C) In the case of a request for a special reduction of withholding 
pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of this section, a statement of law and 
facts in support of the request.
    (ii) Exemption. If a withholding certificate is sought on the basis 
of the transferor's exemption from U.S. tax, the application must set 
forth a brief statement of the law and facts that support the claimed 
exemption. In this regard, see paragraph (d) of this section.
    (iii) Agreement. If a withholding certificate is sought on the basis 
of an agreement for the payment of tax, the application must include a 
signed copy of the agreement proposed by the applicant and a copy of the 
security instrument (if any) proposed by the applicant. In this regard, 
see paragraph (e) of this section.
    (5) Special rule for exclusions from income under section 121. A 
withholding certificate may be sought on the basis of a section 121 
exclusion as a reduction in the amount of tax due under paragraph 
(c)(2)(v) of this section. The application must include information 
establishing that the transferor, who is a nonresident alien individual 
at the time of the sale (and is therefore subject to sections 897 and 
1445) is entitled to claim the benefits of section 121. For example, a 
claim for reduced withholding as a result of section 121 must include 
information that the transferor occupied the U.S. real property interest 
as his or her personal residence for the required period of time.
    (6) Special rule for like-kind exchanges under Section 1031. A 
withholding certificate may be requested with respect to a like-kind 
exchange under section 1031 as a transaction subject to a nonrecognition 
provision under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. The application 
must include information substantiating the requirements of section 
1031. The IRS may require additional information during the course of 
the application process to determine that the requirements of section 
1031 are satisfied. In the case of a deferred like-kind exchange, the 
withholding agent is excused from reporting and paying the withholding 
tax to the IRS within 20 days after the transfer only if an application 
for a withholding certificate is submitted prior to or on the date of 
transfer. See Sec. 1.1445-1(c)(2) for rules concerning delayed 
reporting and payment where an application for a withholding certificate 
has been submitted to the IRS prior to or on the date of transfer.
    (c) Adjustment of amount required to be withheld--(1) In general. 
The Internal Revenue Service may issue a withholding certificate that 
excuses withholding or that permits the transferee to withhold an 
adjusted amount reflecting the transferor's maximum tax liability. The 
transferor's maximum tax liability is the sum of--
    (i) The maximum amount which could be imposed as tax under section 
871 or 882 upon the transferor's disposition of the subject real 
property interest, as determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, 
and
    (ii) The transferor's unsatisfied withholding liability with respect 
to the subject real property interest, as determined under paragraph 
(c)(3) of this section.

In addition, the Internal Revenue Service may issue a withholding 
certificate that permits the transferee to withhold a reduced amount if 
the Service determines pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of this section that 
reduced withholding will not jeopardize the collection of tax.
    (2) Maximum tax imposed on disposition. The first element of the 
transferor's maximum tax liability is the maximum amount which the 
transferor could be required to pay as tax upon

[[Page 177]]

the disposition of the subject real property interest. In the case of an 
individual transferor that amount will generally be the contract price 
of the property minus its adjusted basis, multiplied by the maximum 
individual income tax rate applicable to long term capital gain. In the 
case of a corporate transferor, that amount will generally be the 
contract price of the property minus its adjusted basis, multiplied by 
the maximum corporate income tax rate applicable to long term capital 
gain. However, that amount must be adjusted to take into account the 
following:
    (i) Any reduction of tax to which the transferor is entitled under 
the provisions of a U.S. income tax treaty;
    (ii) The effect of any nonrecognition provision that is applicable 
to the transaction;
    (iii) Any losses realized and recognized upon the previous 
disposition of U.S. real property interests during the taxable year;
    (iv) Any amount that is required to be treated as ordinary income; 
and
    (v) Any other factor that may increase or reduce the tax upon the 
disposition.
    (3) Transferor's unsatisfied withholding liability--(i) In general. 
The second element of the transferor's maximum tax liability is the 
transferor's unsatisfied withholding liability. That liability is the 
amount of any tax that the transferor was required to but did not 
withhold and pay over under section 1445 upon the acquisition of the 
subject U.S. real property interest or a predecessor interest. The 
transferor's unsatisfied withholding liability is included in the 
calculation of maximum tax liability so that such prior withholding 
liability can be satisfied by the transferee's withholding upon the 
current transfer. Alternatively, the transferor's unsatisfied 
withholding liability may be disregarded for purposes of calculating the 
maximum tax liability, if either--
    (A) Such prior withholding liability is fully satisfied by a payment 
that is made with the application submitted pursuant to this section; or
    (B) An agreement is entered into for the payment of that liability 
pursuant to the rules of paragraph (e) of this section.


Because section 1445 only requires withholding after December 31, 1984, 
no transferor's unsatisfied withholding liability can exist unless the 
transferor acquired the subject or predecessor real property interest 
after that date. For purposes of this paragraph (c), a predecessor 
interest is one that was exchanged for the subject U.S. real property 
interest in a transaction in which the transferor was not required to 
recognize the full amount of the gain or loss realized upon the 
transfer.
    (ii) Evidence that no unsatisfied withholding liability exists. For 
purposes of paragraph (b)(4)(i)(B) of this section (concerning 
information that must be submitted with an application for a withholding 
certificate), evidence that the transferor has no unsatisfied 
withholding liability includes any one of the following documents:
    (A) Evidence that the transferor acquired the subject or predecessor 
real property interest prior to January 1, 1985;
    (B) A copy of the Form 8288 that was filed by the transferor, and 
proof of payment of the amount shown due thereon, with respect to the 
transferor's acquisition of the subject or predecessor real property 
interest;
    (C) A copy of a withholding certificate with respect to the 
transferor's acquisition of the subject or predecessor real property 
interest, plus a copy of Form 8288 and proof of payment with respect to 
any withholding required under that certificate;
    (D) A copy of the non-foreign certification furnished by the person 
from whom the subject or predecessor U.S. real property interest was 
acquired, executed at the time of that acquisition;
    (E) Evidence that the transferor purchased the subject or 
predecessor real property for $300,000 or less, and a statement signed 
by the transferor under penalties of perjury, that the transferor 
purchased the property for use as a residence within the meaning of 
Sec. 1.1445-2(d)(1);
    (F) Evidence that the person from whom the transferor acquired the 
subject or predecessor U.S. real property interest fully paid any tax 
imposed on

[[Page 178]]

that transaction pursuant to section 897.
    (G) A copy of a notice of nonrecognition treatment provided to the 
transferor pursuant to Sec. 1.1445-2(d)(2) by person from whom the 
transferor acquired the subject or predecessor U.S. real property 
interest; and
    (H) A statement, signed by the transferor under penalties of 
perjury, setting forth the facts and circumstances that supported the 
transferor's conclusion that no withholding was required under section 
1445(a) with respect to the transferor's acquisition of the subject or 
predecessor real property interest.
    (4) Special reduction of amount required to be withheld. The 
Internal Revenue Service may, in its discretion, issue a withholding 
certificate that permits the transferee to withhold a reduced amount 
based upon a determination that reduced withholding will not jeopardize 
the collection of tax. A transferor that requests a withholding 
certificate pursuant to this paragraph (c)(4) is required pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(4)(i)(C) of this section to submit a statement of law and 
facts in support of the request. That statement must explain why the 
transferor is unable to enter into an agreement for the payment of tax 
pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section.
    (d) Transferor's exemption from U.S. tax--(1) In general. The 
Internal Revenue Service will issue a withholding certificate that 
excuses all withholding by a transferee if it is established that:
    (i) The transferor's gain from the disposition of the subject U.S. 
real property interest will be exempt from U.S. tax, and
    (ii) The transferor has no unsatisfied withholding liability.

For the available exemptions, see paragraph (d)(2) of this section. The 
transferor's unsatisfied withholding liability shall be determined in 
accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c)(3) of this section. A 
transferor that is entitled to a reduction of (rather than an exemption 
from) U.S. tax may obtain a withholding certificate to that effect 
pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) Available exemptions. A transferor's gain from the disposition 
of a U.S. real property interest may be exempt from U.S. tax because 
either:
    (i) The transferor is an integral part or controlled entity of a 
foreign government and the disposition of the subject property is not a 
commercial activity, as determined pursuant to section 892 and the 
regulations thereunder; or
    (ii) The transferor is entitled to the benefits of an income tax 
treaty that provides for such an exemption (subject to the limitations 
imposed by section 1125(c) of Pub. L. 96-499, which, in general, 
overrides such benefits as of January 1, 1985).
    (e) Agreement for the payment of tax--(1) In general. The Internal 
Revenue Service will issue a withholding certificate that excuses 
withholding or that permits a transferee to withhold a reduced amount, 
if either the transferee or the transferor enters into an agreement for 
the payment of tax pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph (e). An 
agreement for the payment of tax is a contract between the Service and 
any other person that consists of two necessary elements. Those elements 
are--
    (i) A contract between the Service and the other person, setting 
forth in detail the rights and obligations of each; and
    (ii) A security instrument or other form of security acceptable to 
the Director, Foreign Operations District.
    (2) Contents of agreement--(i) In general. An agreement for the 
payment of tax must cover an amount described in subdivision (ii) or 
(iii) of this paragraph (e)(2). The agreement may either provide 
adequate security for the payment of the chosen amount in accordance 
with paragraph (e)(3) of this section, or provide for the payment of 
that amount through a combination of security and withholding of tax by 
the transferee.
    (ii) Tax that would otherwise be withheld. An agreement for the 
payment of tax may cover the amount of tax that would otherwise be 
required to be withheld pursuant to section 1445(a). In addition to the 
amount computed pursuant to section 1445(a), the applicant must agree to 
pay interest upon that amount, at the rate established under section 
6621, with respect to the period

[[Page 179]]

between the date on which the tax imposed by section 1445(a) would 
otherwise be due (i.e., the 20th day after the date of transfer) and the 
date on which the transferor's payment of tax with respect to the 
disposition will be due under the agreement. The amount of interest 
agreed upon must be paid by the applicant regardless of whether or not 
the Service is required to draw upon any security provided pursuant to 
the agreement. The interest may be paid either with the return or by the 
Service drawing upon the security.
    (iii) Maximum tax liability. An agreement for the payment of tax may 
cover the transferor's maximum tax liability, determined in accordance 
with paragraph (c) of this section. The agreement must also provide for 
the payment of an additional amount equal to 25 percent of the amount 
determined under paragraph (c) of this section. This additional amount 
secures the interest and penalties that would accrue between the date of 
a failure to file a return and pay tax with respect to the disposition, 
and the date on which the Service collects upon that liability pursuant 
to the agreement. Such additional amount will only be collected if the 
Service finds it necessary to draw upon any security provided due to the 
transferor's failure to file a return and pay tax with respect to the 
relevant disposition.
    (3) Major types of security--(i) In general. The following are the 
major types of security acceptable to the Service. Further details with 
respect to the terms and conditions of each type may be specified by 
Revenue Procedure.
    (ii) Bond with surety or guarantor. The Service may accept as 
security with respect to a transferor's tax liability a bond that is 
executed with a satisfactory surety or guarantor. Only the following 
persons may act as surety or guarantor for this purpose
    (A) A surety company holding a certificate of authority from the 
Secretary as an acceptable surety on Federal bonds, as listed in 
Treasury Department Circular No. 570, published annually in the Federal 
Register on the first working day of July;
    (B) A person that is engaged within or without the United States in 
the conduct of a banking, financing, or similar business under the 
principles of Sec. 1.864-4(c)(5), and that is subject to U.S. or 
foreign local or national regulation of such business, if that person is 
otherwise acceptable to the Service; and
    (C) A person that is engaged within or without the United States in 
the conduct of an insurance business that is subject to U.S. or foreign 
local or national regulation, if that person is otherwise acceptable to 
the Service.
    (iii) Bond with collateral. The Service may accept as security with 
respect to a transferor's tax liability a bond that is secured by 
acceptable collateral. All collateral must be deposited with a 
responsible financial institution acting as escrow agent, or, in the 
Service's discretion, with the Service. Only the following types of 
collateral are acceptable:
    (A) Bonds, notes, or other public debt obligations of the United 
States, in accordance with the rules of 31 CFR part 225; and
    (B) A certified cashier's, or treasurer's check, drawn on an entity 
acceptable to the Service that is engaged within or without the United 
States in the conduct of a banking, financing, or similar business under 
the principles of Sec. 1.864-4(c)(5) and that is subject to U.S. or 
foreign local or national regulation of such business.
    (iv) Letter of credit. The Service may accept as security with 
respect to a transferor's tax liability an irrevocable letter of credit. 
The Service may accept a letter of credit issued by an entity acceptable 
to the Service that is engaged within or without the United States in 
the conduct of a banking, financing, or similar business under the 
principles of Sec. 1.864-4(c)(5) and that is subject to U.S. or foreign 
local or national regulation of such business. However, the Director 
will accept a letter of credit from an entity that is not engaged in 
trade or business in the United States only if such letter may be drawn 
on an advising bank within the United States.
    (v) Guarantees and other non-conforming security--(A) Guarantee. The 
Service may in its discretion accept as security with respect to a 
transferor's tax liability the applicant's guarantee that it will pay 
such liability. The

[[Page 180]]

Service will in general accept such a guarantee only from a corporation, 
foreign or domestic, any class of stock of which is regularly traded on 
an established securities market on the date of the transfer.
    (B) Other forms of security. The Service may in unusual 
circumstances and at its discretion accept any form of security that if 
finds to be adequate. An application for a withholding certificate that 
proposes a form of security that does not conform with any of the 
preferred types set forth in paragraph (e)(3) (ii) through (iv) of this 
section or any relevant Revenue Procedure must include:
    (1) A detailed statement of the facts and circumstances supporting 
the use of the proposed form of security, and
    (2) A memorandum of law concerning the validity and enforceability 
of the proposed form of security.
    (4) Terms of security instrument. Any security instrument that is 
furnished pursuant to this section must provide that--
    (i) The amount of each deposit of estimated tax that will be 
required with respect to the gain realized on the subject disposition 
may be collected by levy upon the security as of the date following the 
date on which each such deposit is due (unless such deposit is timely 
made);
    (ii) The entire amount of the liability may be collected by levy 
upon the security at any time during the nine months following the date 
on which the payment of tax with respect to the subject disposition is 
due, subject to release of the security upon the full payment of the tax 
and any interest and penalties due. If the transferor requests an 
extension of time to file a return with respect to the disposition, then 
the Director may require that the term of the security instrument be 
extended until the date that is nine months after the filing deadline as 
extended.
    (f) Amendments to application for withholding certificate--(1) In 
general. An applicant for a withholding certificate may amend an 
otherwise complete application by submitting an amending statement to 
the Director, Philadelphia Service Center, at the address provided in 
Sec. 1.1445-1(g)(10). The amending statement shall provide the 
information required by Sec. 1.1445-3(f)(3) and must be signed and 
accompanied by a penalties of perjury statement in accordance with Sec. 
1.1445-3(b)(1).
    (2) Extension of time for the Service to process reqests for 
withholding certificates--(i) In general. If an amending statement is 
submitted, the time in which the Internal Revenue Service must act upon 
the amended application shall be extended by 30 days.
    (ii) Substantial amendments. If an amending statement is submitted 
and the Service finds that the statement substantially amends the facts 
of the underlying application or substantially alters the terms of the 
withholding certificate as requested in the initial application, the 
time within which the Service must act upon the amended application 
shall be extended by 60 days. The applicant shall be so notified.
    (iii) Amending statement received after the requested withholding 
certificate has been signed by the Director, Philadelphia Service 
Center. If an amending statement is received after the withholding 
certificate, drafted in response to the underlying application, has been 
signed by the Director, Philadelphia Service Center or his delegate and 
prior to the day such certificate is mailed to the applicant, the time 
in which the Service must act upon the amended application shall be 
extended by 90 days. The applicant will be so notified.
    (3) Information required to be submitted. No particular form is 
required for an amending statement but the statement must provide the 
following information:
    (i) Identification of applicant. The amending statement must set 
forth the name, address and identifying number of the person submitting 
the amending statement (specifying whether that person is the transferee 
or transferor).
    (ii) Date of underlying application. The amending statement must set 
forth the date of the underlying application for a withholding 
certificate.
    (iii) Real property interest to be (or that has been) transferred. 
The amending statement must set forth a brief description of the real 
property interest with respect to which the underlying application for a 
withholding certificate was submitted.

[[Page 181]]

    (iv) Amending information. The amending statement must fully set 
forth the basis for the amendment including any modification of the 
facts supporting the application for a withholding certificate and any 
change sought in the terms of the withholding certificate.
    (g) Early refund of overwithheld amounts. If a transferor receives a 
withholding certificate pursuant to this section, and an amount greater 
than that specified in the certificate was withheld by the transferee, 
then pursuant to the rules of this paragraph (g) the transferor may 
apply for a refund (without interest) of the excess amount prior to the 
date on which the transferor's tax return is due (without extensions). 
(Any interest payable on refunds issued after the filing of a tax return 
shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of section 6611 
and regulations thereunder.) An application for an early refund must be 
addressed to the Director, Philadelphia Service Center, at the address 
provided in Sec. 1.1445-1(g)(10). No particular form is required for 
the application, but the following information must be set forth in 
separate paragraphs numbered to correspond with the number given below:
    (1) Name, address, and identifying number of the transferor seeking 
the refund;
    (2) Amount required to be withheld pursuant to the withholding 
certificate issued by Internal Revenue Service;
    (3) Amount withheld by the transferee (attach a copy of Form 8288-A 
stamped by IRS pursuant to Sec. 1.1445-1(c));
    (4) Amount to be refunded to the transferor. An application for an 
early refund cannot be processed unless the required copy of Form 8288-A 
(or substantial evidence of the amount withheld in the case of a failure 
to receive Form 8288-A as provided in Sec. 1.1445-1(f)(3)) is attached 
to the application. If an application for a withholding certificate 
based upon the transferor's maximum tax liability is submitted after the 
transfer takes place, then that application may be combined with an 
application for an early refund. The Service will act upon a claim for 
refund within the time limits set forth in paragraph (a) of this 
section.
    (h) Effective date for taxpayer identification numbers. The 
requirement in paragraphs (b)(2), (f)(3)(i), and (g)(1) of this section 
that taxpayer identification numbers be provided (in all cases) is 
applicable for dispositions of U.S. real property interests occurring 
after November 3, 2003.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1445-4  Liability of agents.

    (a) Duty to provide notice of false certification or statement to 
transferee. A transferee's or transferor's agent must provide notice to 
the transferee if either--
    (1) The transferee is furnished with a non-U.S. real property 
interest statement pursuant to Sec. 1.1445-2(c)(3) and the agent knows 
that the statement is false; or
    (2) The transferee is furnished with a non-foreign certification 
pursuant to Sec. 1.1445-2(b)(2) and either (i) the agent knows that the 
certification is false, or (ii) the agent represents a transferor that 
is a foreign corporation. An agent that represents a transferor that is 
a foreign corporation is not required to provide notice to the 
transferee if the foreign corporation provided a non-foreign 
certification to the transferee prior to such agent's employment and the 
agent does not know that the corporation did so.
    (b) Duty to provide notice of false certification or statement to 
entity or fiduciary. A transferee's or transferor's agent must provide 
notice to an entity or fiduciary that plans to carry out a transaction 
described in section 1445(e) (1), (2), (3), or (4) if either--
    (1) The entity or fiduciary is furnished with a non-U.S. real 
property interest statement pursuant to Sec. 1.1445-5(b)(4)(iii) and 
the agent knows that such statement is false; or
    (2) The entity or fiduciary is furnished with a non-foreign 
certification pursuant to Sec. 1.1445-5(b)(3) (ii) and either (i) the 
agent knows that such certification is false, or (ii) the agent 
represents a foreign corporation that made such a certification.

[[Page 182]]

    (c) Procedural requirements--(1) Notice to transferee, entity, or 
fiduciary. An agent who is required by this section to provide notice 
must do so in writing as soon as possible after learning of the false 
certification or statement, but not later than the date of the transfer 
(prior to the transferee's payment of consideration). If an agent first 
learns of a false certification or statement after the date of the 
transfer, notice must be given by the third day following that 
discovery. The notice must state that the certification or statement is 
false and may not be relied upon. The notice must also explain the 
possible consequences to the recipient of a failure to withhold. The 
notice need not disclose the information on which the agent's statement 
is based. The following is an example of an acceptable notice.``This is 
to notify you that you may be required to withhold tax in connection 
with (describe transaction). You have been provided with a certification 
of non-foreign status (or a non-U.S. real property interest statement) 
in connection with that transaction. I have learned that that document 
is false. Therefore, you may not rely upon it as a basis for failing to 
withhold under section 1445 of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 1445 
provides that any person who acquires a U.S. real property interest from 
a foreign person must withhold a tax equal to 10 percent of the total 
purchase price. (The term `U.S. real property interest' includes real 
property, stock in U.S. corporations whose assets are primarily real 
property, and some personal property associated with realty.) Any person 
who is required to withhold but fails to do so can be held liable for 
the tax. Thus, if you do not withhold the 10 percent tax from the total 
that you pay on this transaction you could be required to pay the tax 
yourself, if what you are acquiring is a U.S. real property interest and 
the transferor is a foreign person. Tax that is withheld must be 
promptly paid over to the IRS using Form 8288. For further information 
see sections 897 and 1445 of the Internal Revenue Code and the related 
regulations.''
    (2) Notice to be filed with IRS. An agent who is required by 
paragraph (a) or (b) of this section to provide notice to a transferee, 
entity, or fiduciary must furnish a copy of that notice to the Internal 
Revenue Service by the date on which the notice is required to be given 
to the transferee, entity, or fiduciary. The copy of the notice must be 
delivered to the Director, Philadelphia Service Center at the address 
provided in Sec. 1.1445-1(g)(10) and must be accompanied by a cover 
letter stating that the copy is being filed pursuant to the requirements 
of this Sec. 1.1445-4(c)(2).
    (d) Effect on recipient. A transferee, entity, or fiduciary that 
receives a notice pursuant to this section prior to the date of the 
transfer from any agent of the transferor or transferee may not rely 
upon the subject certification or statement for purposes of excusing 
withholding pursuant to Sec. 1.1445-2 or Sec. 1.1445-5. Therefore, the 
recipient of a notice may be held liable for any failure to deduct and 
withhold tax under section 1445 as if such certification or statement 
had never been given. For special rules concerning the effect of the 
receipt of a notice after the date of the transfer, see Sec. Sec. 
1.1445-2(b)(4)(iv) and 1.1445-5 (c), (d) and (e).
    (e) Failure to provide notice. Any agent who is required to provide 
notice but who fails to do so in the manner required by paragraph (a) or 
(b) of this section shall be held liable for the tax that the recipient 
of the notice would have been required to withhold under section 1445 if 
such notice had been given. However, an agent's liability under this 
paragraph (e) is limited to the amount of compensation that that agent 
derives from the transaction. In addition, an agent who assists in the 
preparation of, or fails to disclose knowledge of, a false certification 
or statement may be liable for civil or criminal penalties.
    (f) Definition of transferor's or transferee's agent--(1) In 
general. For purposes of this section, the terms ``transferor's agent'' 
and ``transferee's agent'' means any person who represents the 
transferor or transferee (respectively)--
    (i) In any negotiation with another person (or another person's 
agent) relating to the transaction; or
    (ii) In settling the transaction.

[[Page 183]]

    (2) Transactions subject to section 1445(e). In the case of 
transactions subject section 1445(e), the following definitions apply.
    (i) The term ``transferor's agent'' means any person that represents 
or advises an entity or fiduciary with respect to the planning, 
arrangement, or consummation by the entity of a transaction described in 
section 1445(e) (1), (2), (3), or (4).
    (ii) The term ``transferee's agent'' means any person that 
represents or advises the holder of an interest in an entity with 
respect to the planning, arrangement or consummation by the entity of a 
transaction described in section 1445(e) (1), (2), (3), or (4).
    (3) Exclusion of settlement officers and clerical personnel. For 
purposes of this section, a person shall not be treated as a 
transferor's agent or transferee's agent with respect to any transaction 
solely because such person performs one or more of the following 
activities.
    (i) The receipt and disbursement of any portion of the consideration 
for the transaction;
    (ii) The recording of any document in connection with the 
transaction;
    (iii) Typing, copying, and other clerical tasks;
    (iv) The obtaining of title insurance reports and reports concerning 
the condition of the real property that is the subject of the 
transaction; or
    (v) The transmission or delivery of documents between the parties.
    (4) Exclusion for governing body of a condominium association and 
the board of directors of a cooperative housing corporation. The members 
of a board, committee or other governing body of a condominium 
association and the board of directors and officers of a cooperative 
housing corporation will not be deemed agents of the transferor or 
transferee if such individuals function exclusively in their capacity as 
representatives of such association or corporation with respect to the 
transaction. In addition, the managing agent of a cooperative housing 
corporation or condominium association will not be deemed to be an agent 
of the transferee or transferor if such person functions exclusively in 
its capacity as a managing agent. If a person's activities include 
advising the transferee or transferor with respect to the transfer, this 
exclusion shall not apply.

Sec. 1.1445-5  Special rules concerning distributions and other 
transactions by corporations, partnerships, trusts, and estates.

    (a) Purpose and scope. This section provides special rules 
concerning the withholding that is required under section 1445(e) upon 
distributions and other transactions involving domestic or foreign 
corporations, partnerships, trusts, and estates. Paragraph (b) of this 
section provides rules that apply generally to the various withholding 
requirements set forth in this section. Under section 1445(e)(1) and 
paragraph (c) of this section, a domestic partnership or the fiduciary 
of a domestic trust or estate is required to withhold tax upon the 
entity's disposition of a U.S. real property interest if any foreign 
persons are partners or beneficiaries of the entity. Paragraph (d) 
provides rules concerning the requirement of section 1445(e)(2) that a 
foreign corporation withhold tax upon its distribution of a U.S. real 
property interest to its interest-holders. Finally, under section 
1445(e)(3) and paragraph (e) of this section a domestic U.S. real 
property holding corporation is required to withhold tax upon certain 
distributions to interest-holders that are foreign persons. Paragraphs 
(f) and (g) of this section are reserved to provide rules concerning 
transactions involving interests in partnerships, trusts, and estates 
that will be subject to withholding pursuant to sections 1445(e) (4) and 
(5).
    (b) Rules of general application--(1) Double withholding not 
required. If tax is required to be withheld with respect to a transfer 
of property in accordance with the rules of this section, then no 
additional tax is required to be withheld by the transferee of the 
property with respect to that transfer pursuant to the general rules of 
section 1445(a) and Sec. 1.1445-1. For rules coordinating the 
withholding under section 1441 (or section 1442 or 1443) and under 
section 1445 on distributions from a corporation, see Sec. 1.1441-
3(b)(4). If a transfer of

[[Page 184]]

a U.S. real property interest described in section 1445(e) is exempt 
from withholding under the rules of this section, then no withholding is 
required under the general rules of section 1445(a) and Sec. 1.1445-1.
    (2) Coordination with nonrecognition provisions--(i) In general. 
Withholding shall not be required under the rules of this section with 
respect to a transfer described in section 1445(e) of a U.S. real 
property interest if--
    (A) By reason of the operation of a nonrecognition provision of the 
Internal Revenue Code or the provisions of any treaty of the United 
States no gain or loss is required to be recognized by the foreign 
person with respect to which withholding would otherwise be required; 
and
    (B) The entity or fiduciary that is otherwise required to withhold 
complies with the notice requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this 
section. The entity or fiduciary must determine whether gain or loss is 
required to be recognized pursuant to the rules of section 897 and the 
applicable nonrecognition provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. An 
entity or fiduciary may obtain a withholding certificate from the 
Internal Revenue Service that confirms the applicability of a 
nonrecognition provision, but is not required to do so. For purposes of 
this paragraph (b)(2), a nonrecognition provision is any provision of 
the Internal Revenue Code for not recognizing gain or loss. If 
nonrecognition treatment is available only with respect to part of the 
gain realized on a transfer, the exemption from withholding provided by 
this paragraph (b)(2) shall not apply. In such cases a withholding 
certificate may be sought pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 1.1445-6.
    (ii) Notice of nonrecognition transfer. An entity or fiduciary that 
fails to withhold tax with respect to a transfer in reliance upon the 
rules of this paragraph (b)(2) must by the 20th day after the date of 
the transfer deliver a notice thereof to the Director, Philadelphia 
Service Center, at the address provided in Sec. 1.1445-1(g)(10). No 
particular form is required for a notice of transfer, but the following 
information must be set forth in paragraphs labelled to correspond with 
the letter set forth below:
    (A) A statement that the document submitted constitutes a notice of 
a nonrecognition transfer pursuant to the requirements of Sec. 1.1445-
5(b)(2)(ii);
    (B) The name, office address, and identifying number of the entity 
of fiduciary submitting the notice;
    (C) The name, identifying number, and home address (in the case of 
an individual) or office address (in the case of an entity) of each 
foreign person with respect to which withholding would otherwise be 
required;
    (D) A brief description of the transfer; and
    (E) A brief statement of the law and facts supporting the claim that 
recognition of gain or loss is not required with respect to the 
transfer.
    (3) Interest-holder not a foreign person--(i) In general. Pursuant 
to the provisions of paragraphs (c) and (e) of this section, an entity 
or fiduciary is required to withhold with respect to certain transfers 
of property if a holder of an interest in the entity is a foreign 
person. For purposes of determining whether a holder of an interest is a 
foreign person, and entity or fiduciary may rely upon a certification of 
nonforeign status provided by that person in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(3)(ii) of this section. Except to the extent provided in paragraph 
(b)(3)(iii) of this section, such a certification excuses the entity or 
fiduciary from any liability otherwise imposed pursuant to section 
1445(e) and regulations thereunder. However, no obligation is imposed 
upon an entity or fiduciary to obtain certifications from interest-
holders; an entity or fiduciary may instead rely upon other means to 
ascertain the nonforeign status of an interest-holder. If the entity or 
fiduciary does rely upon other means but the interest-holder proves, in 
fact, to be a foreign person, then the entity or fiduciary is subject to 
any liability imposed pursuant to section 1445 and regulations 
thereunder.

An entity or fiduciary is not required to rely upon other means to 
ascertain the non-foreign status of an interest-holder and may demand a 
certification of non-foreign status. If the certification is not 
provided, the entity or fiduciary may withhold tax under section 1445 
and will be considered, for

[[Page 185]]

purposes of sections 1461 through 1463, to have been required to 
withhold such tax.
    (ii) Interest-holder's certification of non-foreign status--(A) In 
general. For purposes of this section, an entity or fiduciary may treat 
any holder of an interest in the entity as a U.S. person if that 
interest-holder furnishes to the entity or fiduciary a certification 
stating that the interest-holder is not a foreign person, in accordance 
with the provisions of paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B) of this section. In 
general, a foreign person is a nonresident alien individual, foreign 
corporation, foreign partnership, foreign trust, or foreign estate, but 
not a resident alien individual. In this regard, see Sec. 1.897-1(k).
    (B) Procedural rules. An interest-holder's certification of non-
foreign status must--
    (1) State that the interest-holder is not a foreign person;
    (2) Set forth the interest-holder's name, identifying number, home 
address (in the case of an individual), or office address (in the case 
of an entity), and place of incorporation (in the case of a 
corporation); and
    (3) Be signed under penalties of perjury.

Pursuant to Sec. 1.897-1(p), an individual's identifying number is the 
individual's Social Security number and any other person's identifying 
number is its U.S. employer identification number. The certification 
must be signed by a responsible officer in the case of a corporation, by 
a general partner in the case of a partnership, and by a trustee, 
executor, or equivalent fiduciary in the case of a trust or estate. No 
particular form is needed for a certification pursuant to this paragraph 
(b)(3)(ii)(B), nor is any particular language required, so long as the 
document meets the requirements of this paragraph. Samples of acceptable 
certifications are provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(D) of this section. 
An entity may rely upon a certification pursuant to this paragraph 
(b)(3)(ii)(B) for a period of two calendar years following the close of 
the calendar year in which the certification was given.

If an interest holder becomes a foreign person within the period 
described in the preceding sentence, the interest-holder must notify the 
entity prior to any further dispositions or distributions and upon 
receipt of such notice (or any other notification of the foreign status 
of the interest-holder) the entity may no longer rely upon the prior 
certification. An entity that obtains and relies upon a certification 
must retain that certification with its books and records for a period 
of three calendar years following the close of the last calendar year in 
which the entity relied upon the certification.
    (C) Foreign corporation that has made an election under section 
897(i). A foreign corporation that has made a valid election under 
section 897(i) to be treated as a domestic corporation for purposes of 
section 897 may provide a certification of non-foreign status pursuant 
to this paragraph (b)(3)(ii). However, an electing foreign corporation 
must attach to such certification a copy of the acknowledgment of the 
election provided to the corporation by the Internal Revenue Service 
pursuant to Sec. 1.897-3(d)(4).

An acknowledgment is valid for this purpose only if it states that the 
information required by Sec. 1.897-3 has been determined to be 
complete.
    (D) Sample certifications--(1) Individual interest-holder.

    ``Under section 1445(e) of the Internal Revenue Code, a corporation, 
partnership, trust or estate must withhold tax with respect to certain 
transfers of property if a holder of an interest in the entity is a 
foreign person. To inform (name of entity) that no withholding is 
required with respect to my interest in it, I, (name of interest-
holder), hereby certify the following:

    1. I am not a nonresident alien for purposes of U.S. income 
taxation;
    2. My U.S. taxpayer identifying number (Social Security number) is 
--------; and
    3. My home address is

I agree to inform [name of entity] promptly if I become a nonresident 
alien at any time during the three years immediately following the date 
of this notice.
    I understand that this certification may be disclosed to the 
Internal Revenue Service by (name of entity) and that any false 
statement I have made here could be punished by fine, imprisonment, or 
both.
    Under penalties of perjury I declare that I have examined this 
certification and to the best of my knowledge and belief it is true, 
correct, and complete.

    (2) Entity interest-holder. ``Under section 1445(e) of the Internal 
Revenue Code, a corporation, partnership, trust, or estate must withhold

interest in the entity is a foreign person. To inform [name of entity] 
that no withholding is required with respect to [name of interest-

[Title ]''

    (iii) Reliance upon certification not permitted. An entity or 
fiduciary may not rely upon an interest-holder's certification of non-
foreign status if, prior to or at the time of the transfer with respect 
to which withholding would be required, the entity or fiduciary either--
    (A) Has actual knowledge that the certification is false;
    (B) Has received a notice that the certification is false from a 
transferor's or transferee's agent, pursuant to Sec. 1.1445-4; or
    (C) Has received from a corporation that it knows to be a foreign 
corporation a certification that does not have attached to it a copy of 
the IRS acknowledgment of the corporation's election under section 
897(i), as required by paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(C) of this section. Such an 
entity's or fiduciary's withholding obligations shall apply as if a 
statement had never been given, and such an entity or fiduciary may be 
held fully liable pursuant to Sec. 1.1445-1(e) for any failure to 
withhold. For special rules concerning an entity's belated receipt of a 
notice concerning a false certification, see paragraphs (c)(2)(ii) and 
(e)(2)(iii) of this section.
    (4) Property transferred not a U.S. real property interest--(i) In 
general. Pursuant to the provisions of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this 
section, an entity or fiduciary is required to withhold with respect to 
certain transfers of property, if the property transferred is a U.S. 
real property interest. (In addition, taxable distributions of U.S. real 
property interests by domestic or foreign partnerships, trusts, and 
estates will be subject to withholding pursuant to section 1445(e)(4) 
and paragraph (f) of this section after publication of a Treasury 
decision under sections 897 (e)(2) and (g). As defined in section 897(c) 
and Sec. 1.897-1(c), a U.S. real property interest includes certain 
interests in U.S. corporations, as well as direct interests in real 
property and certain associated personal property. This paragraph (b)(4) 
provides rules pursuant to which an entity (or fiduciary thereof) that 
transfers an interest in a U.S. corporation may determine that 
withholding is not required because the interest transferred is not a 
U.S. real property interest. To determine whether an interest in 
tangible property constitutes a U.S. real property interest the transfer 
of which would be subject to withholding, see Sec. 1.897-1 (b) and (c).
    (ii) Interests in publicly traded entities. Withholding is not 
required under paragraph (c) or (d) of this section upon an entity's 
transfer of an interest in a domestic corporation if any class of stock 
of the corporation is regularly traded on an established securities 
market. This exemption shall apply to a disposition incident to an 
initial public offering of stock pursuant to a registration statement 
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Similarly, no withholding is required under paragraph (c) or (d) of this 
section upon an entity's transfer of an interest in a publicly traded 
partnership

[[Page 187]]

or trust. However, the rule of this paragraph (b)(4)(ii) shall not apply 
to the transfer, to a single transferee (or related transferees as 
defined in Sec. 1.897-1(i)) in a single transaction (or related 
transactions), of an interest described in Sec. 1.897-1(c)(2)(iii)(B) 
(relating to substantial amounts of non-publicly traded interests in 
publicly traded corporations) or of similar interests in publicly traded 
partnerships or trusts. The entity making a transfer described in the 
preceding sentence must otherwise determine whether withholding is 
required, pursuant to section 1445(e) and the regulations thereunder. 
Transactions shall be deemed to be related if they are undertaken within 
90 days of one another or if it can otherwise be shown that they were 
undertaken in pursuance of a prearranged plan.
    (iii) Corporation's statement that interest is not a U.S. real 
property interest. (A) In general. No withholding is required under 
paragraph (c) or (d) of this section upon an entity's transfer of an 
interest in a domestic corporation if, prior to the transfer, the entity 
or fiduciary obtains a statement, issued by the corporation pursuant to 
Sec. 1.897-2(h), certifying that the interest is not a U.S. real 
property interest. In general, a corporation may issue such a statement 
only if the corporation was not a U.S. real property holding corporation 
at any time during the previous five years (or the period in which the 
interest was held by its present holder, if shorter) or if interests in 
the corporation ceased to be United States real property interests under 
section 897(c)(1)(B). (A corporation may not provide such a statement 
based on its determination that the interest in question is an interest 
solely as a creditor.) See Sec. 1.897-2 (f) and (h). A corporation's 
statement may be relied upon for purposes of this paragraph (b)(4)(iii) 
only if the statement is dated not more than 30 days prior to the date 
of the transfer.
    (B) Reliance on statement not permitted. An entity or fiduciary is 
not entitled to rely upon a statement that an interest in a corporation 
is not a U.S. real property interest, if, prior to or at the time of the 
transfer, the entity or fiduciary either--
    (1) Has actual knowledge that the statement is false, or
    (2) Receives a notice that the statement is false from a 
transferor's or transferee's agent, pursuant to Sec. 1.1445-4.

Such an entity's or fiduciary's withholding obligations shall apply as 
if a statement had never been given, and such an entity or fiduciary may 
be held fully liable pursuant to Sec. 1.1445-1(e) for any failure to 
withhold. For special rules concerning an entity's belated receipt of a 
notice concerning a false statement, see paragraphs (c)(2)(iii) and 
(d)(2)(i) of this section.
    (5) Reporting and paying over of withheld amounts--(i) In General. 
An entity or fiduciary must report and pay over to the Internal Revenue 
Service any tax withheld pursuant to section 1445(e) and this section by 
the 20th day after the date of the transfer (as defined in Sec. 1.1445-
1(g)(8). Forms 8288 and 8288-A are used for this purpose and must be 
filed at the location as provided in the instructions to Forms 8288 and 
8288-A. The contents of Forms 8288 and 8288-A are described in Sec. 
1.1445-1(d). Pursuant to section 7502 and regulations thereunder, the 
timely mailing of Forms 8288 and 8288-A by U.S. mail will be treated as 
their timely filing. Form 8288-A will be stamped by the Internal Revenue 
Service to show receipt, and a stamped copy will be mailed by the 
Service to the interest holder if the Form 8288 is complete, including 
the transferor's identifying number, at the address shown on the form, 
for the interest-holder's use. See paragraph (b)(7) of this section. If 
an application for a withholding certificate with respect to a transfer 
of a U.S. real property interest was submitted to the Internal Revenue 
Service on the day of or at any time prior to the transfer, the entity 
or fiduciary must withold the amount required under section 1445(e) and 
the rules of this section. However, the amount withheld, or a lesser 
amount as determined by the Service, need not be reported and paid over 
to the Service until the 20th day following the Service's final 
determination. For this purpose, the Service's final determination

[[Page 188]]

occurs on the day when the withholding certificate is mailed to the 
applicant by the Service or when a notification denying the request for 
a withholding certificate is mailed to the applicant by the Service. An 
application is submitted to the Service on the day it is actually 
received by the Service at the address provided in Sec. 1.1445-1(g)(10) 
or, under the rules of section 7502, on the day it is mailed to the 
Service at the address provided in Sec. 1.1445-1(g)(10). For rules 
concerning the issuance of withholding certificates, see Sec. 1.1445-6.
    (ii) Anti-abuse rule. An entity or fiduciary that in reliance upon 
the rules of this paragraph (b)(5)(ii) fails to report and pay over 
amounts withheld by the 20th day following the date of the transfer, 
shall be subject to the payment of interest and penalties if the 
relevant application for a withholding certificate (or an amendment of 
the application for a withholding certificate) was submitted for a 
principle purpose of delaying the payment to the IRS of the amount 
withheld. Interest and penalties shall be assessed on the amount that is 
ultimately paid over, with respect to the period between the 20th day 
after the date of the transfer and the date on which payment is made.
    (6) Liability upon failure to withhold. For rules regarding 
liability upon failure to withhold under section 1445(e) and this Sec. 
1.1445-5, see Sec. 1.1445-1(e).
    (7) Effect of withholding by entity or fiduciary upon interest 
holder. The withholding of tax under section 1445(e) does not excuse a 
foreign person that is subject to U.S. tax by reason of the operation of 
section 897 from filing a U.S. tax return. Thus, Form 1040NR. 1041. or 
1120F, as appropriate must be filed and any tax due must be paid, by the 
filing date otherwise applicable to such person (or any extension 
thereof). The tax withheld with respect to the foreign person under 
section 1445(e) (as shown on Form 8288-A) shall be credited against the 
amount of income tax as computed in such return, but only if the stamped 
copy of Form 8288-A provided to the entity or fiduciary (under paragraph 
(b)(5) of this section) is attached to the return or substantial 
evidence of the amount of tax withheld is attached to the return in 
accordance with the succeeding sentence. If a stamped copy of Form 8288-
A has not been provided to the interest-holder by the Service, the 
interest-holder may establish the amount of tax withheld by the entity 
or fiduciary by attaching to its return substantial evidence of such 
amount. Such an interest-holder must attach to its return a statement 
which supplies all of the information required by Sec. 1.1445-1(d)(2). 
If the amount withheld under section 1445(e) constitutes less than the 
full amount of the foreign person's U.S. tax liability for that taxable 
year, then a payment of estimated tax may be required to be made 
pursuant to section 6154 or 6654 prior to the filing of the income tax 
return for the year. Alternatively, if the amount withheld under section 
1445(e) exceeds the foreign person's maximum tax liability with respect 
to the transaction (as reflected in a withholding certificate issued by 
the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to Sec. 1.1445-6), then the 
foreign person may seek an early refund of the excess pursuant to Sec. 
1.1445-6(g). A foreign person that takes gain into account in accordance 
with the provisions of section 453 shall not be entitled to a refund to 
the amount withheld, unless a withholding certificate providing for such 
a refund is obtained pursuant to Sec. 1.1445-6. If an entity or 
fiduciary withholds tax under section 1445(e) with respect to a 
beneficial owner of an interest who is not a foreign person, such 
beneficial owner may credit the amount of any tax withheld against his 
income tax liability in accordance with the provisions of this Sec. 
1.1445-5(b)(7) or apply for an early refund under Sec. 1.1445-6(g).
    (8) Effective dates--(i) Partnership, trust, and estate dispositions 
of U.S. real property interests. The provisions of section 1445(e)(1) 
and paragraph (c) of this section, requiring withholding upon certain 
dispositions of U.S. real property interests by domestic partnerships, 
trusts, and estates, shall apply to any disposition on or after January 
1, 1985.
    (ii) Certain distributions by foreign corporations. The provisions 
of section 1445(e)(2) and paragraph (d) of this section, requiring 
withholding upon distributions of U.S. real property interests by 
foreign corporations shall apply

[[Page 189]]

to distributions made on or after January 1, 1985.
    (iii) Distributions by certain domestic corporations to foreign 
shareholders. The provisions of section 1445(e)(3) and paragraph (e)(1) 
of this section, requiring withholding upon distributions in redemption 
of stock under section 302(a) or liquidating distributions under Part II 
of subchapter C of the Internal Revenue Code by U.S. real property 
holding corporations to foreign shareholders, shall apply to 
distributions made on or after January 1, 1985. The provisions of 
section 1445(e)(3) and paragraph (e)(1) of this section requiring 
withholding on distributions under section 301 by U.S. real property 
holding corporations to foreign shareholders shall apply to 
distributions made after August 20, 1996. The provisions of paragraph 
(e) of this section providing for the coordination of withholding 
between sections 1445 and 1441 (or 1442 or 1443) for distributions under 
section 301 by U.S. real property holding corporations to foreign 
shareholders apply to distributions after December 31, 2000 (see Sec. 
1.1441-3(c)(4) and (h)).
    (iv) Taxable distributions by domestic or foreign partnerships, 
trusts, and estates. The provisions of section 1445(e)(4), requiring 
withholding upon certain taxable distributions by domestic or foreign 
partnerships, trusts, and estates, shall apply to distributions made on 
or after the effective date of a Treasury decision under section 897 
(e)(2)(B)(ii) and (g).
    (v) [Reserved]
    (vi) Tiered Partnerships. No withholding is required upon the 
disposition of a U.S. real property interest by a partnership which is 
directly owned, in whole or in part, by another domestic partnership 
(but only to the extent that the amount realized is attributable to the 
partnership interest of that other partnership) until the effective date 
of a Treasury Decision published under section 1445(e) providing rules 
governing this matter.
    (c) Dispositions of U.S. real property interests by domestic 
partnerships, trusts, and estates--(1) Withholding required--(i) In 
general. If a domestic partnership, trust, or estate disposes of a U.S. 
real property interest and any partner, beneficiary, or owner of the 
entity is a foreign person, then the partnership or the trustee, 
executor, or equivalent fiduciary of the trust or estate must withhold 
tax with respect to each such foreign person in accordance with the 
provisions of subdivision (ii), (iii), or (iv), of this paragraph (c)(1) 
(as applicable). The withholding obligation imposed by this paragraph 
(c) applies to the fiduciary of a trust even if the grantor of the trust 
or another person is treated as the owner of the trust or any portion 
thereof for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code. Thus, the withholding 
obligation imposed by this paragraph (c) applies to the trustee of a 
land trust or similar arrangement, even if such a trustee is not 
ordinarily treated under the applicable provisions of local law as a 
true fiduciary.
    (ii) Disposition by partnership. A partnership must withhold a tax 
equal to 35 percent (or the highest rate specified in section 
1445(e)(1)) of each foreign partner's distributive share of the gain 
realized by the partnership upon the disposition of each U.S. real 
property interest. Such distributive share of the gain must be 
determined pursuant to the principles of section 704 and the regulations 
thereunder. For the rules applicable to partnerships, interests in which 
are regularly traded on an established securities market, see Sec. 
1.1445-8.
    (iii) Disposition by trust or estate.--(A) In general. A trustee, 
fiduciary, executor or equivalent fiduciary (hereafter collectively 
referred to as the fiduciary) of a trust or estate having one or more 
foreign beneficiaries must withhold tax in accordance with the rules of 
this Sec. 1.1445-5(c)(1)(iii). Such a fiduciary must establish a U.S. 
real property interest account and must enter in such account all gains 
and losses realized during the taxable year of the trust or estate from 
dispositions of U.S. real property interests. The fiduciary must 
withhold 35 percent (or the highest rate specified in section 
1445(e)(1)) of any distribution to a foreign beneficiary that is 
attributable to the balance in the U.S. real property interest account 
on the day of the distribution. A distribution from a trust or estate to 
a beneficiary (domestic or foreign) shall, solely for purposes of

[[Page 190]]

section 1445(e)(1), be deemed to be attributable first to any balance in 
the U.S. real property interest account and then to other amounts. 
However, a distribution that occurs prior to the transfer of a U.S. real 
property interest in a taxable year or at any other time when the amount 
contained in the U.S. real property interest account is zero, is not 
subject to withholding under this Sec. 1.1445-5(c)(1)(iii). The U.S. 
real property interest account is reduced by the amount distributed to 
all beneficiaries (domestic and foreign) attributable to such account 
during the taxable year of the trust or estate. Any ending balance of 
the U.S. real property interest account not distributed by the close of 
the taxable year of the trust or estate is cancelled and is not carried 
over (or carried back) to any other year. Thus, the beginning balance of 
such account in any taxable year of the trust or estate is always zero. 
For rules applicable to grantor trusts see Sec. 1.1445-5(c)(1)(iv). For 
rules applicable to trusts, interests in which are regularly traded on 
an established securities market and real estate investment trusts, see 
Sec. 1.1445-8.
    (B) Example.The following example illustrates the rules of paragraph 
(c)(1)(iii)(A) of this section.

    On January 1, 1994, A establishes a domestic trust (which has as its 
taxable year, the calendar year) for the benefit of B, a nonresident 
alien, and C, a U.S. citizen. The trust is not a trust subject to 
sections 671 through 679. Under the terms of the trust, the trustee, T, 
is given discretion to distribute income and corpus of the trust to 
provide for the reasonable needs of B and C. During the trust's 1994 tax 
year, T disposes of three parcels of vacant land located in the United 
States. The following chart illustrates the computation of the amount 
subject to withholding under section 1445 with respect to distributions 
made by T to B and C during 1994.

    (iv) Disposition by grantor trust. The trustee or equivalent 
fiduciary of a trust that is subject to the provisions of subpart E of 
part 1 of subchapter J (sections 671 through 679) must withhold a tax 
equal to 35 percent (or the highest rate specified in section 
1445(e)(1)) of the gain realized from each disposition of a U.S. real 
property interest to the extent such gain is allocable to a portion of 
the trust treated as owned by a foreign person under subpart E of part 1 
of subchapter J.
    (2) Withholding not required under paragraph (c)--(i) [Reserved]
    (ii) Interest-holder not a foreign person--(A) In general. A 
domestic partnership, trust, or estate that disposes of a U.S. real 
property interest shall not be required to withhold with respect to any 
partner or beneficiary that it determines, pursuant to the rules of 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section, not to be a foreign person.
    (B) Belated notice of false certification. If after the date of the 
transfer a partnership or fiduciary learns that a partner's or 
beneficiary's certification of non-foreign status is false, then that 
partnership or fiduciary shall be required to withhold, with respect to 
the foreign partner or beneficiary that gave the false certification, 
the lessor of--
    (1) The amount otherwise required to be withheld under the rules of 
this paragraph (c), or
    (2) An amount equal to that partner's or beneficiary's remaining 
interests in the income or assets of the partnership, trust, or estate. 
Amounts so withheld must be reported and paid over by the 60th day 
following the date on which the partnership or fiduciary learns that the 
certification is false.

[[Page 191]]

For rules concerning the notifications of false certifications that may 
be required to be given to partnerships and fiduciaries, see Sec. 
1.1445-4(b).
    (iii) Property disposed of not a U.S. real property interest--(A) In 
general. No withholding is required under this paragraph (c) if a 
domestic partnership, trust, or estate that disposes of property 
determines pursuant to the rules of paragraph (b)(4) of this section 
that the property disposed of is not a U.S. real property interest.
    (B) Belated notice of false statement. If after the date of the 
transfer a partnership or fiduciary learns that a corporation's 
statement (that an interest in the corporation is not a U.S. real 
property interest) is false, then that partnership or fiduciary shall be 
required to withhold, with respect to each foreign partner or 
beneficiary, the lesser of--
    (1) The amount otherwise required to be withheld under the rules of 
this paragraph (c), or
    (2) An amount equal to that partner's or beneficiary's remaining 
interests in the income or assets of the parnership, trust, or estate.

Amounts so withheld must be reported and paid over by the 60th day 
following the date on which the partnership or fiduciary learns that the 
statement is false. For rules concerning the notifications of false 
statements that may be required to be given to partnerships or 
fiduciaries, see Sec. 1.1445-4(b).
    (iv) Withholding certificate. No withholding is required under this 
paragraph (c) with respect to the transfer of a U.S. real property 
interest if the Internal Revenue Service issues a withholding 
certificate that so provides. For rules concerning the issuance of 
withholding certificates, see Sec. 1.1445-6.
    (v) Nonrecognition transactions. For special rules concerning 
transactions entitled to nonrecognition of gain or loss, see paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section.
    (3) Large partnerships or trusts--(i) In general. If a partnership 
or trust has more than 100 partners or beneficiaries, then the 
partnership or fiduciary of the trust may elect to withhold in 
accordance with the provisions of this Sec. 1.1445-5(c)(3) in lieu of 
withholding in the manner required by Sec. 1.1445-5(c)(1). However, the 
rules of this Sec. 1.1445-5(c)(3) shall not apply to any partnership or 
trust interests in which are regularly traded on an established 
securities market except as described in Sec. 1.1445-8(c)(1). The rules 
of this Sec. 1.1445-5(c)(3) shall not apply to any real estate 
investment trust. See Sec. 1445-8.
    (ii) Amount to be withheld. A partnership or trust electing to 
withhold under this Sec. 1.1445-5(c)(3) shall withhold from each 
distribution to a foreign person an amount equal to 35 percent (or the 
highest rate specified in section 1445(e)(1)) of the amount attributable 
to section 1445(e)(1) transfers.
    (iii) Amounts attributable to section 1445(e)(1) transfers. A 
distribution is attributable to section 1445(e)(1) transfers to the 
extent of the partner's or beneficiary's proportionate share of the 
current balance of the entity's section 1445(e)(1) account. A 
distribution from a partnership or trust that has made an election under 
this Sec. 1.1445-5(c)(3) shall be deemed first to be attributable to a 
section 1445(e)(1) transfer to the extent of the balance in the section 
1445(e)(1) account. An entity's section 1445(e)(1) account shall be 
equal to--
    (A) The total amount of net gain realized by the entity upon all 
transfers of U.S. real property interests carried out by the entity 
after the date of its election under this Sec. 1.1445-5(c)(3); minus
    (B) The total amount of all distributions by the entity to domestic 
and foreign distributees from such account.
    (iv) Special rules for entities that make recurring sales of growing 
crops and timber. An entity that makes an election under Sec. 1.1445-
5(c)(3) and that makes recurring sales of growing crops and timber may 
further elect to determine the amount subject to withholding under the 
rules of this Sec. 1.1445-5(c)(3)(iv). Such an entity must withhold 
from each distribution to a foreign partner or beneficiary an amount 
equal to 10 percent of such partner's or beneficiary's proportionate 
share of the current balance of the entity's gross section 1445(e)(1) 
account. An entity's gross section 1445(e)(1) account equals--
    (A) The total amount realized by the entity upon all transfers of 
U.S. real property interests carried out by the

[[Page 192]]

entity after the date of its election under this Sec. 1.1445-
5(c)(3)(iv); minus
    (B) The total amount of all distributions to domestic and foreign 
distributees from such account.

An entity that elects to compute the amount subject to withholding under 
this Sec. 1.1445-5(c)(3)(iv), shall make such election in accordance 
with Sec. 1.1445-5(c)(3)(vi) and shall be subject to the provisions 
otherwise applicable under Sec. 1.1445-5(c)(3).
    (v) Procedural rules. An election under paragraph (c)(3) may be made 
by filing a notice thereof with the Director, Philadelphia Service 
Center, at the address provided in Sec. 1.1445-1(g)(10). The notice 
must be submitted by a general partner (in the case of a partnership) or 
the trustee or equivalent fiduciary (in the case of a trust). The notice 
must set forth the name, office address, and identifying number of the 
partnership or fiduciary making the election, and, in the case of a 
partnership, must include the name, office address, and identifying 
number of the general partner submitting the election. An election under 
this paragraph (c)(3) may be revoked only with the consent of the 
Internal Revenue Service. Consent of the Service may be requested by 
filing an application to revoke the election with the Director, 
Philadelphia Service Center at the address stated above. This 
application must include all information provided to the Service with 
the election notice and must provide an explanation of the reasons for 
revoking the election. The application to revoke an election must also 
specify the amount remaining to be distributed in the section 1445(e)(1) 
account or the gross section 1445(e)(1) account.

An entity that ceases to qualify under section 1.1445-5(c)(3) because 
such entity does not have more than 100 partners or beneficiaries may 
revoke its election only with the consent of the Internal Revenue 
Service.
    (d) Distributions of U.S. real property interests by foreign 
corporations--(1) In general. A foreign corporation that distributes a 
U.S. real property interest must deduct and withhold a tax equal to 35 
percent (or the rate specified in section 1445(e)(2)) of the amount of 
gain recognized by the corporation on the distribution. The amount of 
gain required to be recognized by the corporation must be determined 
pursuant to the rules of section 897 and any other applicable section. 
For special rules concerning the applicability of a nonrecognition 
provision to a distribution, see paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The 
withholding liability imposed by this paragraph (d) applies to the same 
taxpayer that owes the related substantive income tax liability pursuant 
to the operation of section 897. Only one such liability will be 
assessed and collected from a foreign corporation, but separate 
penalties for failures to comply with the two requirements will be 
asserted.
    (2) Withholding not required--(i) Property distributed not a U.S. 
real property interest--(A) In general. No withholding is required under 
this paragraph (d) if a foreign corporation that distributes property 
determines pursuant to the rules of paragraph (b)(3) of this section 
that the property distributed is not a U.S. real property interest.
    (B) Belated notice of false statement. If after the date of a 
distribution described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section a foreign 
corporation learns that another corporation's statement (that an 
interest in that other corporation is not a U.S. real property interest) 
is false, then the foreign corporation may not rely upon that statement 
for any purpose. Such a foreign corporation's withholding obligations 
under this paragraph (d) shall apply if a statement had never been 
given, and such a corporation may be held fully liable pursuant to Sec. 
1.1445-5(b)(5) for any failure to withhold. Amounts withheld pursuant to 
the rule of this paragraph (d)(2)(i)(B) must be reported and paid over 
by the 60th day following the date on which the foreign corporation 
learns that the statement is false. No penalties or interest will be 
assessed for failures to withhold prior to that date. For rules 
concerning the notifications of false statements that may be required to 
be given to foreign corporations, see Sec. 1.1445-4(b).
    (ii) Withholding certificate. No withholding is required under this 
paragraph (d) with respect to a foreign corporation's distribution of a 
U.S. real property interest if the distributing

[[Page 193]]

corporation obtains a withholding certificate from the Internal Revenue 
Service that so provides. For rules concerning the issuance of 
withholding certificates, see Sec. 1.1445-6.
    (e) Distributions to foreign persons by U.S. real property holding 
corporations--(1) In general. A domestic corporation that distributes 
any property to a foreign person that holds an interest in the 
corporation must deduct and withhold a tax equal to 10 percent of the 
fair market value of the property distributed to the foreign person, 
if--
    (i) The foreign person's interest in the corporation constitutes a 
U.S. real property interest under the provisions of section 897 and 
regulations thereunder; and
    (ii) There is a distribution of property in redemption of stock 
treated as an exchange under section 302(a), in liquidation of the 
corporation pursuant to the provisions of Part II of subchapter C of the 
Internal Revenue Code (sections 331 through section 346), or with 
respect to stock under section 301 that is not made out of earnings and 
profits of the corporation.
    (2) Coordination rules for Section 301 distributions. If a domestic 
corporation makes a distribution of property under section 301 to a 
foreign person whose interest in such corporation constitutes a U.S. 
real property interest under the provisions of section 897 and the 
regulations thereunder, then see Sec. 1.1441-3(c)(4) for rules 
coordinating withholding obligations under sections 1445 and 1441 (or 
1442 or 1443)).
    (3) Withholding not required--(i) Foreign person's interest not a 
U.S. real property interest. Withholding is required under this 
paragraph (e) only with respect to distributions to foreign persons 
holding interests in the corporation that constitute U.S. real property 
interests. In general, a foreign person's interest in a domestic 
corporation constitutes a U.S. real property interest if the corporation 
was a U.S real property holding corporation at any time during the 
shorter of (A) the period in which the foreign person held the interest 
or (B) the previous five years (but not earlier than June 19, 1980). See 
section 897(c) and Sec. Sec. 1.897-1(c) and 1.897-2 (b) and (h). 
However, an interest in such a corporation ceases to be a U.S. real 
property interest after all of the U.S. real property interests held by 
the corporation itself are disposed of in transactions on which gain or 
loss is recognized. See section 897(c)(1)(B) and Sec. 1.897-2(f)(2). 
Thus, if a U.S. real property holding corporation in the process of 
liquidation does not elect section 337 nonrecognition treatment upon its 
sale of all U.S. real property interests held by the corporation, and 
recognizes gain or loss upon such sales, interests in that corporation 
cease to be U.S. real property interests. Therefore, no withholding 
would be required with respect to that corporation's subsequent 
liquidating distribution to a foreign shareholder of property other than 
a U.S. real property interest.
    (ii) Nonrecognition transactions. For special rules concerning the 
applicability of a nonrecognition provision to a distribution described 
in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, see paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section.
    (iii) Interest-holder not a foreign person--(A) In general. A 
domestic corporation shall not be required to withhold under this 
paragraph (e) with respect to a distribution of property to any 
distributee that it determines, pursuant to the rules of paragraph 
(b)(3) of this section, not to be a foreign person.
    (B) Belated notice of false certification. If after the date of a 
distribution described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section a domestic 
corporation learns that an interest-holder's certification of non-
foreign status is false, then the corporation may rely upon that 
certification only if the person providing the false certification holds 
(or held) less than 10 percent of the value of the outstanding stock of 
the corporation. With respect to less than 10 percent interest-holders, 
no withholding is required under this paragraph (e) upon receipt of a 
belated notice of false certification. With respect to 10 percent or 
greater interest-holders, the corporation's withholding obligations 
under this paragraph (e) shall apply as if a certification had never 
been given, and such a corporation may be held fully liable pursuant to 
Sec. 1.1445-5(b)(6) for any failure to withhold as of the date 
specified in this Sec. 1.1445-5(e)(3)(iii)(B). Amounts withheld 
pursuant to the rule of this paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(B) must be

[[Page 194]]

reported and paid over by the 60th day following the date on which the 
corporation learns that the certification is false. No penalties or 
interest for failures to withhold will be assessed prior to that date. 
For rules concerning the notifications of false certifications that may 
be required to be given to U.S. real property holding corporations, see 
Sec. 1.1445-4(b).
    (iv) Withholding certificate. No withholding, or reduced 
withholding, is required under this paragraph (e) with respect to a 
domestic corporation's distribution of property if the distributing 
corporation obtains a withholding certificate from the Internal Revenue 
Service that so provides. For rules concerning the issuance of 
withholding certificates, see Sec. 1.1445-6.
    (f) Taxable distributions by domestic or foreign partnerships, 
trusts, or estates. [Reserved]
    (g) Dispositions of interests in partnerships, trusts, and estates. 
[Reserved]
    (h) Effective date for taxpayer identification numbers. The 
requirement in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(B) and (C) of this section that 
taxpayer identification numbers be provided (in all cases) is applicable 
for dispositions of U.S. real property interests occurring after 
November 3, 2003.

Sec. 1.1445-6  Adjustments pursuant to withholding certificate of 
amount required to be withheld under section 1445(e).

    (a) Withholding certificate for purposes of section 1445(e)--(1) In 
general. Pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 1.1445-5 (c)(2)(iv), 
(d)(2)(ii), and (e)(2)(iv), withholding under section 1445(e) may be 
reduced or eliminated pursuant to a withholding certificate issued by 
the Internal Revenue Service in accordance with the rules of this Sec. 
1.1445-6. A withholding certificate may be issued in cases where 
adjusted withholding is appropriate (e.g., because of the applicability 
of a nonrecognition provision--see paragraph (c) of this section), where 
the relevant taxpayers are exempt from U.S. tax (see paragraph (d) of 
this section), or where an agreement for the payment of tax is entered 
into with the Service (see paragraph (e) of this section). A withholding 
certificate that is obtained prior to a transfer allows the entity or 
fiduciary to withhold a reduced amount or excuses withholding entirely. 
A withholding certificate that is obtained after a transfer has been 
made may authorize a normal refund or an early refund pursuant to 
paragraph (g) of this section. The Internal Revenue Service will act 
upon an application for a withholding certificate not later than the 
90th day after it is received. (The Service may deny a request for a 
withholding certificate where, after due notice, an applicant fails to 
provide the information necessary to make a determination.) Solely for 
this purpose (i.e., determining the day upon which the 90 day period 
commences), an application is received by the Service on the date when 
all information necessary for the Service to make a determination is 
provided by the applicant. In no event, however, will a withholding 
certificate be issued without the transferor's identifying number. (For 
rules regarding whether an application has been timely submitted, see 
Sec. 1.1445-5(b)(5)). The Internal Revenue Service will act upon an 
application for an early refund not later than the 90th day after it is 
received. An application for an early refund must either (i) include a 
copy of a withholding certificate issued by the Service with respect to 
the transaction, or (ii) be combined with an application for a 
withholding certificate. Where an application for an early refund is 
combined with an application for a withholding certificate, the Service 
will act upon both applications not later than the 90th day after 
receipt. Either an entity, a fiduciary, or a relevant taxpayer (as 
defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section) may apply for a withholding 
certificate. An entity or fiduciary may apply for a withholding 
certificate with respect to all or less than all relevant taxpayers. For 
special rules concerning the issuance of a withholding certificate to a 
foreign corporation that has made an election under section 897(i), see 
Sec. 1.1445-7(d).

[[Page 195]]

    (2) Relevant taxpayer. For purposes of this section, the term 
``relevant taxpayer'' means any foreign person that will bear 
substantive income tax liability by reason of the operation of section 
897 with respect to a transaction upon which withholding is required 
under section 1445(e).
    (b) Applications for withholding certificates--(1) In general. An 
application for a withholding certificate pursuant to this Sec. 1.1445-
6 must be submitted in the manner provided in Sec. 1.1445--3 (b). 
However, in lieu of the information required to be submitted pursuant to 
Sec. 1.1445-3(b)(4), the applicant must provide the information 
required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section. In addition, the 
information required by paragraph (b)(3) of this section must be 
submitted with the application.
    (2) Basis for certificate--(i) Adjusted withholding. If a 
withholding certificate is sought on the basis of a claim that adjusted 
withholding is appropriate, the application must include a calculation, 
in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, of the maximum tax 
that may be imposed on each relevant taxpayer with respect to which 
adjusted withholding is sought. The application must also include all 
evidence necessary to substantiate the claimed calculation, such as 
records of adjustments to basis or appraisals of fair market value.
    (ii) Exemption. If a withholding certificate is sought on the basis 
of a relevant taxpayer's exemption from U.S. tax, the application must 
set forth a brief statement of the law and facts that support the 
claimed exemption. See paragraph (d) of this section.
    (iii) Agreement. If a withholding certificate is sought on the basis 
of an agreement for the payment of tax, the application must include a 
copy of the agreement proposed by the applicant and a copy of the 
security instrument (if any) proposed by the applicant. In this regard, 
see paragraph (e) of this section.
    (3) Relevant taxpayers. An application for withholding certificate 
pursuant to this section must include all of the following information: 
the name, identifying number, and home address (in the case of an 
individual) or office address (in the case of an entity) of each 
relevant taxpayer with respect to which adjusted withholding is sought.
    (c) Adjustment of amount required to be withheld. The Internal 
Revenue Service may issue a withhold certificate that excuses 
withholding or that permits an entity or fiduciary to withhold an 
adjusted amount reflecting the relevant taxpayers' maximum tax 
liability. A relevant taxpayer's maximum tax liability is the maximum 
amount which that taxpayer could be required to pay as tax by reason of 
the transaction upon which withholding is required. In the case of an 
individual taxpayer that amount will generally be the gain realized by 
the individual, multiplied by the maximum individual income tax rate 
applicable to long term capital gain. In the case of a corporate 
taxpayer, that amount will generally be the gain realized by the 
corporation, multiplied by the maximum corporate income tax rate 
applicable to long term capital gain. However, that amount must be 
adjusted to take into account the following:
    (1) Any reduction of tax to which the relevant taxpayer is entitled 
under the provisions of a U.S. income tax treaty;
    (2) The effect of any nonrecognition provision that is applicable to 
the transaction;
    (3) Any losses previously realized and recognized by the relevant 
taxpayer during the taxable year by reason of the operation of section 
897;
    (4) Any amount realized upon the subject transfer by the relevant 
taxpayer that is required to be treated as ordinary income under any 
provision of the Code; and
    (5) Any other factor that may increase or reduce the tax upon the 
transaction.
    (d) Relevant taxpayer's exemption from U.S. tax--(1) In general. The 
Internal Revenue Service will issue a withholding certificate that 
excuses withholding by an entity or fiduciary if it is established that 
a relevant taxpayer's income from the transaction will be exempt from 
U.S. tax. For the available exemptions, see paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section. If a relevant taxpayer is entitled to a reduction of (rather 
than an

[[Page 196]]

exemption from) U.S. tax, then the entity or fiduciary may obtain a 
withholding certificate to that effect pursuant to the provisions of 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) Available exemptions. A relevant taxpayer's income from a 
transaction with respect to which withholding is required under section 
1445(e) may be exempt from U.S. tax because either:
    (i) The relevant taxpayer is an integral part or controlled entity 
of a foreign government and the subject income is exempt from U.S. tax 
pursuant to section 892 and the regulations thereunder; or
    (ii) The relevant taxpayer is entitled to the benefits of an income 
tax treaty that provides for such an exemption (subject to the 
limitations imposed by section 1125(c) of Pub. L. 96-499, which, in 
general overrides such benefits as of January 1, 1985).
    (e) Agreement for the payment of tax--(1) In general. The Internal 
Revenue Service will issue a withholding certificate that excuses 
withholding or that permits an entity or fiduciary to withhold a reduced 
amount, if the entity, fiduciary, or a relevant taxpayer enters into an 
agreement for the payment of tax pursuant to the provisions of this 
paragraph (e). An agreement for the payment of tax is a contract between 
the Service and the entity, fiduciary, or relevant taxpayer that 
consists of two necessary elements. Those elements are--
    (i) A contract between the Service and the other person, setting 
forth in detail the rights and obligations of each; and
    (ii) A security instrument or other form of security acceptable to 
the Assistant Commissioner (International).
    (2) Contents of agreement--(i) In general. An agreement for the 
payment of tax must cover an amount described in subdivision (ii) or 
(iii) of this paragraph (e)(2). The agreement may either provide 
adequate security for the payment of the chosen amount with respect to 
the relevant taxpayer in accordance with paragraph (e)(3) of this 
section or provide for the payment of that amount through a combination 
of security and withholding of tax by the entity or fiduciary.
    (ii) Tax that would otherwise be withheld. An agreement for the 
payment of tax may cover the amount of tax that would otherwise be 
required to be withheld with respect to the relevant taxpayer pursuant 
to section 1445(e). In addition to the amount computed pursuant to 
section 1445(e), the applicant must agree to pay interest upon that 
amount, at the rate established under section 6621, with respect to the 
period between the date on which withholding tax under section 1445(e) 
would otherwise be due and the date on which the relevant taxpayer's 
payment of tax with respect to the disposition will be due. The amount 
of interest agreed upon must be paid by the applicant regardless of 
whether or not the Service is required to draw upon any security 
provided pursuant to the agreement. The interest may be paid either with 
the return or by the Service drawing upon the security.
    (iii) Maximum tax liability. An agreement for the payment of tax may 
cover the relevant taxpayer's maximum tax liability, determined in 
accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. The agreement must also 
provide for the payment of an additional amount equal to 25 percent of 
the amount determined under paragraph (c) of this section. This 
additional amount secures the interest and penalties that would accrue 
between the date of the relevant taxpayer's failure to file a return and 
pay tax with respect to the disposition, and the date of which the 
Service collects upon that liability pursuant to the agreement.
    (iv) Allocation of payment. An agreement for the payment of tax 
pursuant to this section must set forth an allocation of the payment 
provided for by the agreement among the relevant taxpayers with respect 
to which the withholding certificate is sought. In the case of an 
agreement that covers an amount described in subdivision (ii) of this 
paragraph (e)(2), such allocation must be based upon the amount that 
would otherwise be required to be withheld with respect to each relevant 
taxpayer. In the case of an agreement that covers an amount described in 
subdivision (iii) of this paragraph (e)(2), such

[[Page 197]]

allocation must be based upon each relevant taxpayer's maximum tax 
liability.
    (3) Major types of security. The major types of security that are 
acceptable to the Internal Revenue Service for purposes of this section 
are described in Sec. 1.1445-3(e)(3).
    (4) Terms of security instrument. Any security instrument that is 
furnished pursuant to this section must contain the terms described in 
Sec. 1.1445-3(e)(4).
    (f) Amendments to application for withholding certificates--(1) In 
general. An applicant for a withholding certificate may amend an 
otherwise complete application by submitting an amending statement to 
the Director, Philadelphia Service Center at the address provided in 
Sec. 1.1445-1(g)(10). The amending statement shall provide the 
information required by Sec. 1.1445-6(f)(3) and must be signed and 
accompanied by a penalties of perjury statement in accordance with Sec. 
1.1445-6(b).
    (2) Extension of time for the Service to process requests for 
withholding certificates--(i) In general. If an amending statement is 
submitted, the time in which the Internal Revenue Service must act upon 
the amended application shall be extended by 30 days.
    (ii) Substantial amendments. If an amending statement is submitted 
and the Service finds that the statement substantially amends to the 
facts of the underlying application or substantially alters the terms of 
the withholding certificate as requested in the initial application, the 
time within which the Service must act upon the amended application 
shall be extended by 60 days. The applicant shall be so notified.
    (iii) Amending statement received after the requested withholding 
certificate has been signed by the Director, Philadelphia Service 
Center. If an amending statement is received after the withholding 
certificate, drafted in response to the underlying application, has been 
signed by the Director, Philadelphia Service Center or his delegate and 
prior to the day such certificate is mailed to the applicant, the time 
in which the Service must act upon the amended application shall be 
extended by 90 days.
    (3) Information required to be submitted. No particular form is 
required for an amending statement but the statement must provide the 
following information:
    (i) Identification of applicant. The amending statement must set 
forth the name, address, and identifying number of the person submitting 
the amending statement.
    (ii) Date of application. The amending statement must set forth the 
date of the underlying application for a withholding certificate.
    (iii) Real property interest to be (or that has been) transferred. 
The amending statement must set forth a brief description of the real 
property interest with respect to which the underlying application for a 
withholding certificate was submitted.
    (iv) Amending information. The amending statement must fully set 
forth the basis for the amendment including any modification of the 
facts supporting the application for a withholding certificate and any 
change sought in the terms of the withholding certificate.
    (g) Early refund of overwithheld amounts. If the Internal Revenue 
Service issues a withholding certificate pursuant to this section, and 
an amount greater than that specified in the certificate was withheld by 
the entity or fiduciary, then pursuant to the rules of this paragraph 
(g) a relevant taxpayer may apply for an early refund of a proportionate 
share of the excess amount (without interest) prior to the date on which 
the relevant taxpayer's return is due (without extensions). An 
application for an early refund must be addressed to the Director, 
Philadelphia Service Center, at the address provided in Sec. 1.1445-
1(g)(10). No particular form is required for the application, but the 
following information must be set forth in separate paragraphs numbered 
to correspond with the numbers given below:
    (1) Name, address, and identifying number of the relevant taxpayer 
seeking the refund;
    (2) Amount required to be withheld pursuant to withholding 
certificate;
    (3) Amount withheld by entity or fiduciary (attach a copy of Form 
8288-A stamped by IRS pursuant to Sec. 1.1445-5(b)(4) or provide 
substantial evidence of the amount withheld in the case of a

[[Page 198]]

failure to receive Form 8288-A, as provided in Sec. 1.1445-5(b)(7)); 
and
    (4) Amount to be refunded to the relevant taxpayer.

An application for an early refund cannot be processed unless the 
required copy of Form 8288-A or substantial evidence of the amount 
withheld in the case of a failure to receive Form 8288-A (as provided in 
Sec. 1.1445-5(b)(7)) is attached to the application. If an application 
for a withholding certificate is submitted after the transfer takes 
place, then that application may be combined with an application for an 
early refund. The Service will act upon a claim for refund within the 
time limits set forth in Sec. 1.1445-6(a)(1).
    (h) Effective date for taxpayer identification numbers. The 
requirement in paragraphs (b)(3), (f)(3)(i), and (g)(1) of this section 
that taxpayer identification numbers be provided (in all cases) is 
applicable for dispositions of U.S. real property interests occurring 
after November 3, 2003.

Sec. 1.1445-7  Treatment of foreign corporation that has made an election 
under section 897(i) to be treated as a domestic corporation.

    (a) In general. Pursuant to section 897(i) a foreign corporation may 
elect to be treated as a domestic corporation for purposes of sections 
897 and 6039C. A foreign corporation that has made such an election 
shall also be treated as a domestic corporation for purposes of the 
withholding required under section 1445, in accordance with the 
provisions of this section.
    (b) Withholding under section 1445(a)--(1) Dispositions by 
corporation. A foreign corporation that has made an election under 
section 897(i) may provide a transferee with a certification of non-
foreign status in connection with the corporation's disposition of a 
U.S. real property interest. However, in accordance with the provisions 
of Sec. Sec. 1.1445-2(b)(2)(ii) and 1.1445-5(b)(3)(ii)(C), such an 
electing foreign corporation must attach to such certification a copy of 
the acknowledgment of the election provided to the corporation by the 
Internal Revenue Service pursuant to Sec. 1.897-3(d)(4) which states 
that the information required by Sec. 1.897-3 has been determined to be 
complete.
    (2) Dispositions of interests in corporation. Dispositions of 
interests in electing foreign corporations shall be subject to the 
withholding requirements of section 1445(a) and the rules of Sec. Sec. 
1.1445-1 through 1.1445-4. Therefore, if a foreign person disposes of an 
interest in such a corporation, and that interest is a U.S. real 
property interest under the provisions of section 897 and regulations 
thereunder, then the transferee is required to withhold under section 
1445(a).
    (c) Withholding under section 1445(e). Because a foreign corporation 
that has made an election under section 897(i) is treated as a domestic 
corporation for purposes of determining withholding obligations under 
section 1445, such a corporation is not subject to the requirement of 
section 1445(e)(2) that a foreign corporation withhold at the corporate 
capital gain rate from the gain recognized upon the distribution of a 
U.S. real property interest. Such a corporation is subject to the 
provisions of section 1445(e)(3). Thus, if interests in an electing 
corporation constitute U.S. real property interests, then the 
corporation is required to withhold with respect to the non-dividend 
distribution of any property to an interest-holder that is a foreign 
person. See Sec. 1.1445-5(e). Dividend distributions (distributions 
that are described in section 301) shall be treated as provided in 
sections 897(f), 1441 and 1442. In addition, if interests in an electing 
foreign corporation do not constitute U.S. real property interests, then 
distributions by such corporation shall be treated as provided in 
sections 897(f) (if applicable), 1441 and 1442.

Sec. 1.1445-8  Special rules regarding publicly traded partnerships, 
publicly traded trusts and real estate investment trusts (REITs).

    (a) Entities to which this section applies. The rules of this 
section apply to--

[[Page 199]]

    (1) Any partnership or trust, interests in which are regularly 
traded on an established securities market (regardless of the number of 
its partners or beneficiaries), and
    (2) Any REIT (regardless of the form of its organization).

For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the rules of section 
1445 (e)(1) and this section shall not apply to a publicly traded 
partnership (as defined in section 7704) which is treated as a 
corporation under section 7704(a), or to those entities that are 
classified as ``associations'' and taxed as corporations. See Sec. 
301.7701-2.
    (b) Obligation to withhold--(1) In general. An entity described in 
paragraph (a) of this section is not required to withhold under the 
provisions of Sec. 1.1445-5(c), which states the withholding 
requirements of domestic partnerships, trusts and estates upon the 
disposition of U.S. real property interests. Except as otherwise 
provided in this paragraph (b), an entity described in paragraph (a) of 
this section shall be liable to withhold tax upon the distribution of 
any amount attributable to the disposition of a U.S. real property 
interest, with respect to each holder of an interest in the entity that 
is a foreign person. The amount to be withhold is described in paragraph 
(c) of this section.
    (2) Publicly traded partnerships. Publicly traded partnerships which 
comply with the withholding procedures under section 1446 will be deemed 
to have satisfied their withholding obligations under this paragraph 
(b).
    (3) Special rule for certain distributions to nominees. In the case 
of a person that--
    (i) Is a nominee (as defined in paragraph (d) of this section),
    (ii) Receives a distribution attributable to the disposition of a 
U.S. real property interest directly from an entity described in 
paragraph (a) of this section or indirectly from such entity through a 
nominee,
    (iii) Receives the distribution for payment to any foreign person, 
or the account of any foreign person, and
    (iv) Receives a qualified notice pursuant to paragraph (f) of this 
section,

then the obligation to withhold in accordance with the general rules of 
section 1445(e)(1) and this paragraph (b) shall be imposed solely on 
that person to the extent of the amount specified by the qualified 
notice. A person obligated to withhold by reason of this paragraph 
(b)(3) is referred to as a withholding agent.
    (4) Person designated to act for withholding agent. The rules stated 
in Sec. 1.1441-7(b) (1) and (2) regarding a person designated to act 
for a withholding agent shall apply for purposes of this section.
    (5) Effect of withholding exemption granted under Sec. 1.1441-4(f). 
A letter issued by a district director under the provisions of Sec. 
1.1441-4(f), which exempts a person from withholding under section 1441 
or section 1442, shall also exempt that person from withholding under 
this paragraph (b), if--
    (i) The letter identifies another person as the withholding agent 
for purposes of section 1441 or 1442, and
    (ii) Such other person enters into a written agreement, with the 
district director who issued the letter, to be the withholding agent for 
purposes of this paragraph (b).

The exemption granted, and the corresponding withholding obligation 
imposed, by this paragraph (b)(5) shall apply with respect to the first 
distribution made after execution of the agreement described in the 
preceding sentence and shall continue to apply to all distributions made 
during the period in which the exemption granted under Sec. 1.1441-4(f) 
is in effect.
    (6) Payment other than in money. The rule stated in Sec. 1.1441-
7(c) regarding payment other than in money shall apply for purposes of 
this section.
    (c) Amount to be withheld--(1) Distribution from a publicly traded 
partnership or publicly traded trust. The amount to be withheld under 
this section with respect to a distribution by a publicly traded 
partnership or publicly traded trust shall be computed in the manner 
described in Sec. 1.1445-5(c)(3) (ii) and (iii), subject to the rules 
of this section.
    (2) REITs--(i) In general. The amount to be withheld with respect to 
a distribution by a REIT, under this section shall be equal to 35 
percent (or the highest rate specified in section 1445(e)(1)) of the 
amount described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.

[[Page 200]]

    (ii) Amount subject to withholding--(A) In general. Except as 
otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, the 
amount subject to withholding is the amount of any distribution, 
determined with respect to each share or certificate of beneficial 
interest, designated by a REIT as a capital gain dividend, multiplied by 
the number of shares or certificates of beneficial interest owned by the 
foreign person. Solely for purposes of this paragraph, the largest 
amount of any distribution occurring after March 7, 1991 that could be 
designated as a capital gain dividend under section 857(b)(3)(C) shall 
be deemed to have been designated by a REIT as a capital gain dividend 
regardless of the amount actually designated.
    (B) Distribution attributable to net short-term capital gain from 
the disposition of a U.S. real property interest. [Reserved]
    (C) Designation of prior distribution as capital gain dividend. If a 
REIT makes an actual designation of a prior distribution, in whole or in 
part, as a capital gain dividend, such prior distribution shall not be 
subject to withholding under this section. Rather, a REIT must 
characterize and treat as a capital gain dividend distribution (solely 
for purposes of section 1445(e)(1)) each distribution, determined with 
respect to each share or certificate of beneficial interest, made on the 
day of, or any time subsequent to, such designation as a capital gain 
dividend until such characterized amounts equal the amount of the prior 
distribution designated as a capital gain dividend. The provisions of 
this paragraph shall not be applicable in any taxable year in which the 
REIT adopts a formal or informal resolution or plan of complete 
liquidation.
    (iii) Example. The following example illustrates the rules of 
paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section.

    In the first quarter of 1988, XYZ REIT makes a dividend distribution 
of $2X. In the second quarter of 1988, XYZ sells real property, 
recognizing a long term capital gain of $15X, and makes a dividend 
distribution of $5X. In the third quarter of 1988, XYZ makes a 
distribution of $3X. In the fourth quarter of 1988, XYZ sells real 
property recognizing a long term capital loss of $2X. Within 30 days 
after the close of the taxable year, XYZ designates a capital gain 
dividend for the year of $13X. It subsequently makes a fourth quarter 
distribution of $7X. Since XYZ has made an actual designation of prior 
distributions during the taxable year as capital gain dividends, 
withholding on those prior distributions will not be required. However, 
the REIT must characterize, solely for purposes of section 1445(e)(1), a 
total amount of $13X of dividend distributions as capital gain 
dividends. Therefore, the fourth quarter dividend distribution of $7X 
must be characterized as a capital gain dividend subject to withholding 
under this section. In addition, XYZ will be required to characterize an 
additional $6X of subsequent dividend distributions as capital gain 
dividends.

    (d) Definition of nominee. For purposes of this section, the term 
``nominee'' means a domestic person that holds an interest in an entity 
described in paragraph (a) of this section on behalf of another domestic 
or foreign person.
    (e) Determination of non-foreign status by withholding agent. A 
withholding agent may rely on a certificate of non-foreign status 
pursuant to Sec. 1.1445-2(b) or on the statements and address provided 
to it on Form W-9 or a form that is substantailly similar to such form, 
to determine whether an interest holder is a domestic person. Reliance 
on these documents will excuse the withholding agent from liability 
imposed under section 1445(e)(1) in the absence of actual knowledge that 
the interest holder is a foreign person. A withholding agent may also 
employ other means to determine the status of an interest holder, but, 
if the agent relies on such other means and the interest holder proves, 
in fact, to be a foreign person, then the withholding agent is subject 
to any liability imposed pursuant to section 1445 and the regulations 
thereunder for failure to withhold.
    (f) Qualified notice. A qualified notice for purposes of paragraph 
(b)(3)(iv) of this section is a notice given by a partnership, trust or 
REIT regarding a distribution that is attributable to the disposition of 
a U.S. real property interest in accordance with the notice requirements 
with respect to dividends described in 17 CFR 240.10b-17(b) (1) or (3) 
issued pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. 78a et 
seq. In the case of a REIT, a qualified notice is only a notice of a 
distribution, all or any portion of which the

[[Page 201]]

REIT actually designates, or characterizes in accordance with paragraph 
(c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, as a capital gain dividend in accordance 
with 17 CFR 240.10b-17(b) (1) or (3), with respect to each share or 
certificate of beneficial interest. A deemed designation under paragraph 
(c)(2)(ii)(A) of this section may not be the subject of a qualified 
notice under this paragraph (f). A person described in paragraph (b)(3) 
of this section shall be treated as receiving a qualified notice at the 
time such notice is published in accordance wtih 17 CFR 240.10b-17(b) 
(1) or (3).
    (g) Reporting and paying over withheld amounts. With respect to an 
amount withheld under this section, a withholding agent is not required 
to conform to the requirements of Sec. 1.1445-5(b)(5) but is required 
to report and pay over to the Internal Revenue Service any amount 
required to be withheld pursuant to the rules and procedures of section 
1461, the regulations thereunder and Sec. 1.6302-2. Forms 1042 and 
1042S are to be used for this purpose.
    (h) Early refund procedure not available. The early refund procedure 
set forth in Sec. 1.1445-6(g) shall not apply to amounts withheld under 
the rules of this section. For adjustment of over-withheld amounts, see 
Sec. 1.1461.4.
    (i) Liability upon failure to withhold. For rules regarding 
liability upon failure to withhold under Sec. 1445(e) and this section, 
see Sec. 1.1445-1(e).

[T.D. 8321, 55 FR 50553, Dec. 7, 1990; 56 FR 4542, Feb. 5, 1991, as 
amended by T.D. 8647, 60 FR 66077, Dec. 21, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 1.1445-10T  Special rule for Foreign governments (temporary).

    (a) This section provides a temporary regulation that, if and when 
adopted as a final regulation will add a new paragraph (d)(6) to Sec. 
1.1445-2. Paragraph (b) of this section would then appear as paragraph 
(d)(6) of Sec. 1.1445-2.
    (b) Foreign government--(1) As transferor. A foreign government is 
subject to U.S. taxation under section 897 on the disposition of a U.S. 
real property interest except to the extent specifically otherwise 
provided in the regulations issued under section 892. A foreign 
government that disposes of a U.S. real property interest that is not 
subject to taxation as specifically provided by the regulations under 
section 892 may present a notice of nonrecognition treatment pursuant to 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section that specifically cites the provision 
of such regulation, and thereby avoids withholding by the transferee of 
the property. A foreign government that disposes of a U.S. real property 
interest or the transferee of the property may obtain a withholding 
certificate from the Internal Revenue Service that confirms the 
applicability of section 892, but neither is required to do so. Rules 
concerning the issuance of withholding certificates are provided in 
Sec. 1.1445-3.
    (2) As transferee. A foreign government or international 
organization that acquires a U.S. real property interest is fully 
subject to section 1445 and the regulations thereunder. Therefore, such 
an entity is required to withhold tax upon the acquisition of a U.S. 
real property interest from a foreign person.
    (c) Effective date. The rules of this section shall be effective for 
transfers, exchanges, distributions and other dispositions occuring on 
or after June 6, 1988.

[T.D. 8198, 53 FR 16230, May 5, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 1.1445-11T  Special rules requiring withholding under Sec. 1.1445-5 (temporary).

    (a) Purpose and scope. This section provides temporary regulations 
that, if and when adopted as a final regulation will add certain new 
paragraphs within Sec. 1.1445-5 (b) and (c). The paragraphs of this 
section would then appear as set forth below. Paragraph (b) of this 
section would then appear as paragraph (b)(8)(v) of Sec. 1.1445-5. 
Paragraph (c) of this section would then appear as paragraph (c)(2)(i) 
of Sec. 1.1445-5. Paragraph (d) of this section would then appear as 
paragraph (g) of Sec. 1.1445-5.
    (b) Dispositions of interests in partnerships, trusts, and estates. 
The provisions of section 1445(e)(5), requiring withholding upon certain 
dispositions of interests in partnerships, trusts, and estates, that own 
directly or indirectly a U.S. real property interest shall apply to 
dispositions on or after the effective date of a later Treasury decision 
under section 897(g) of the Code except in the

[[Page 202]]

case of dispositions of interests in partnerships in which fifty percent 
of the value of the gross assets consist of U.S. real property interests 
and ninety percent or more of the value of the gross assets consist of 
U.S. real property interests plus any cash or cash equivalents. The 
provisions of section 1445(e)(5), shall apply, however, to dispositions 
after June 6, 1988, of interests in partnerships in which fifty percent 
or more of the value of the gross assets consist of U.S. real property 
interests, and ninety percent or more of the value of the gross assets 
consist of U.S. real property interests plus any cash or cash 
equivalents. See paragraph (d) of this section.
    (c) Transactions covered elsewhere. No withholding is required under 
this paragraph (c) with respect to the distribution of a U.S. real 
property interest by a partnership, trust, or estate. Such distributions 
shall be subject to withholding under section 1445(e)(4) and paragraph 
(f) of this Sec. 1.1445-5 on the effective date of a later Treasury 
decision published under section 897(g) of the Code. No withholding is 
required at this time for distributions described in the preceding 
sentence. See paragraph (b)(8)(iv) of this Sec. 1.1445-5. No 
withholding is required under this paragraph with respect to the 
disposition of an interest in a trust, estate, or partnership except in 
the case of a partnership in which fifty percent or more of the value of 
the gross assets consist of U.S. real property interests, and ninety 
percent or more of the value of the gross assets consist of U.S. real 
property interests plus any cash or cash equivalents. See paragraph 
(b)(8)(v) of Sec. 1.1445-5. Withholding shall be required as provided 
in section 1445(e)(5) and paragraph (g) of this section with respect to 
the disposition after June 6, 1988, of an interest in a partnership in 
which fifty percent or more of the value of the gross assets consist of 
U.S. real property interests, and ninety percent or more of the value of 
the gross assets consist of U.S. real property interests plus any cash 
or cash equivalents.
    (d) Dispositions of interests in partnerships, trusts or estates--
(1) Withholding required on disposition of certain partnership 
interests. Withholding is required under section 1445(e)(5) and this 
paragraph with respect to the disposition by a foreign partner of an 
interest in a domestic or foreign partnership in which fifty percent or 
more of the value of the gross assets consist of U.S. real property 
interests, and ninety percent or more of the value of the gross assets 
consist of U.S. real property interests plus any cash or cash 
equivalents. For purposes of this paragraph cash equivalents mean any 
asset readily convertible into cash (whether or not denominated in U.S. 
dollars), including, but not limited to, bank accounts, certificates of 
deposit, money market accounts, commercial paper, U.S. and foreign 
treasury obligations and bonds, corporate obligations and bonds, 
precious metals or commodities, and publicly traded instruments. The 
taxpayer on filing an income tax return for the year of the disposition 
may demonstrate the extent to which the gain on the disposition of the 
interest is not attributable to U.S. real property interests. A taxpayer 
is also permitted by Sec. 1.1445-3 to apply for a withholding 
certificate in instances where reduced withholding is approporiate.
    (2) Withholding not required--(i) Transferee receives statement that 
interest in partnership is not described in paragraph (d)(1). No 
withholding is required under paragraph (d)(1) of this section upon the 
disposition of a partnership interest otherwise described in that 
paragraph if the transferee is provided a statement, issued by the 
partnership and signed by a general partner under penalties of perjury 
no earlier than 30 days before the transfer, certifying that fifty 
percent or more of the value of the gross assets does not consist of 
U.S. real property interests, or that ninety percent or more of the 
value of the gross assets of the partnership does not consist of U.S. 
real property interests plus cash or cash equivalents.
    (ii) Reliance on statement not permitted. A transferee is not 
entitled to rely upon a statement described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of 
this section if, prior to or at the time of the transfer, the transferee 
either--
    (A) Has actual knowledge that the statement is false, or

[[Page 203]]

    (B) Receives a notice, pursuant to Sec. 1.1445-4.

Such a transferee's withholding obligations shall apply as if the 
statement had never been given, and such a transferee may be held fully 
liable pursuant to Sec. 1.1445-1(e) for any failure to withhold.
    (iii) Belated notice of false statement. If, after the date of the 
transfer, a transferee receives notice that a statement provided under 
paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section is false, then such transferee may 
rely on the statement only with respect to consideration that was paid 
prior to the receipt of the notice. Such a transferee is required to 
withhold a full 10 percent of the amount realized from the consideration 
that remains to be paid to the transferor. Thus, if 10 percent or more 
of the amount realized remains to be paid to the transferor, then the 
transferee is required to withhold and pay over the full 10 percent. The 
transferee must do so by withholding and paying over the entire amount 
of each successive payment of consideration to the transferor, until the 
full 10 percent of the amount realized has been withheld and paid over. 
Amounts so withheld must be reported and paid over by the 20th day 
following the date on which each such payment of consideration is made. 
A transferee that is subject to the rules of this Sec. 1.1445-
10T(d)(2)(iii) may not obtain a withholding certificate pursuant to 
Sec. 1.1445-3, but must instead withhold and pay over the amounts 
required by this paragraph.
    (e) Effective date. The rules of this section are effective for 
transactions after June 6, 1988.

                         TAX-FREE COVENANT BONDS


<R05>
Sec. 1.1451-1  Tax-free covenant bonds issued before January 1, 1934.

    (a) Rates of withholding--(1) Rate of 2 percent. Withholding of a 
tax equal to 2 percent is required in the case of interest upon bonds or 
other corporate obligations containing a tax-free covenant and issued 
before January 1, 1934, paid to an individual, a fiduciary, or a 
partnership, whether resident or nonresident, or to a nonresident 
foreign corporation, regardless of whether the liability assumed by the 
obligor is less than, equal to, or greater than 2 percent.
    (2) Rate of 30 percent. Notwithstanding subparagraph (1) of this 
paragraph, if the liability assumed by the obligor does not exceed 2 
percent of the interest, withholding is required at the rate of 30 
percent in the case of payments to a nonresident alien individual, a 
nonresident partnership composed in whole or in part of nonresident 
aliens, a nonresident foreign corporation, or an owner who is unknown to 
the withholding agent.
    (3) Obligations of resident payers. The rates of withholding 
specified in subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph are applicable 
to interest on such tax-free covenant bonds issued by a domestic 
corporation or by a resident foreign corporation.
    (4) Obligations of nonresident payers. A nonresident foreign 
corporation having a fiscal or paying agent in the United States is 
required to withhold a tax of 2 percent in the case of interest upon its 
tax-free covenant bonds issued before January 1, 1934, which is paid to 
an individual or fiduciary who is a citizen or resident of the United 
States, to a partnership any member of which is a citizen or resident, 
or to an unknown owner.
    (5) Interest from sources without the United States. Withholding is 
not required under section 1451 in the case of interest upon bonds or 
other corporate obligations issued before January 1, 1934, and 
containing a tax-free covenant if the interest is not to be treated as 
income from sources within the United States and the payments are made 
to a nonresident alien, a partnership composed wholly of nonresident 
aliens, or a nonresident foreign corporation.
    (6) Tax treaties. The rates of tax to be withheld in accordance with 
this paragraph shall be reduced as may be provided by treaty with any 
country. See section 894 and Sec. 1.1441-6 relating to income subject 
to a reduced rate of, or an exemption from, income tax pursuant to an 
income tax convention.
    (b) Date of issue. The withholding provisions of section 1451 are 
applicable only to bonds, mortgages, or deeds of trust, or other similar 
obligations of a

[[Page 204]]

corporation which were issued before January 1, 1934, and which contain 
a tax-free covenant. For the purpose of section 1451, bonds, mortgages, 
or deeds of trust, or other similar obligations of a corporation, are 
issued when delivered. If a broker or other person acts as selling agent 
of the obligor, the obligation is issued when delivered by the agent to 
the purchaser. If a broker or other person purchases the obligation 
outright for the purpose of holding or reselling it, the obligation is 
issued when delivered to such broker or other person.
    (c) Extended maturity date. In cases where on or after January 1, 
1934, the maturity date of bonds or other obligations of a corporation 
is extended, the bonds or other obligations shall be considered to have 
been issued on or after January 1, 1934. The interest on such 
obligations is not subject to the withholding provisions of section 1451 
but falls within the class of interest described in section 1441. See 
paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of Sec. 1.1441-3.
    (d) Covenant in trust deed. Bonds issued under a trust deed 
containing a tax-free covenant are treated as if they contain such a 
covenant. If neither the bonds nor the trust deeds given by the obligor 
to secure them contained a tax-free covenant, but the original trust 
deeds were modified before January 1, 1934, by supplemental agreements 
containing a tax-free covenant executed by the obligor corporation and 
the trustee, the bonds issued before January 1, 1934, are subject to the 
provisions of section 1451, provided appropriate authority existed for 
the modification of the trust deeds in this manner. The authority must 
have been contained in the original trust deeds or actually secured from 
the bondholders.
    (e) Notation showing date of issue. In order that the date of issue 
of bonds, mortgages, deeds of trust, or other similar corporate 
obligations containing a tax-free covenant may be readily determined by 
the owner for the purpose of preparing the ownership certificates 
required by Sec. 1.1461-1, the issuing or debtor corporation shall 
indicate the date of issue by an appropriate notation, or use the phrase 
``issued on or after January 1, 1934,'' on each such obligation or in a 
statement accompanying the delivery of the obligation.
    (f) Effect of withholding on income taxes of bondholder and issuing 
corporation--(1) Federal tax. In the case of corporate bonds or other 
corporate obligations issued before January 1, 1934, and containing a 
tax-free covenant, the corporation paying a Federal tax, or any part of 
it, for someone else pursuant to its agreement is not entitled to deduct 
such payment from its gross income on any ground; nor shall the tax so 
paid be included in the gross income of the bondholder. The amount of 
the tax so paid may, nevertheless, be claimed by the bondholder in 
accordance with paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.1462-1 as a credit against the 
total amount of income tax due. See also section 32. The tax so paid by 
the corporation upon tax-free covenant bond interest payable to a 
domestic or resident fiduciary and allocable to any nonresident alien 
beneficiary under section 652 or 662 is allowable, pro rata, as a credit 
against:
    (i) The tax required to be withheld by the fiduciary in accordance 
with paragraph (f) of Sec. 1.1441-3 from the income of the beneficiary, 
and
    (ii) The total income tax computed in the return of the beneficiary, 
as indicated in paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.1462-1.
    (2) State taxes. In the case of corporate bonds or other obligations 
containing an appropriate tax-free covenant, the corporation paying for 
someone else, pursuant to its agreement, a State tax or any tax other 
than a Federal tax may deduct such payment as interest paid on 
indebtedness.
    (g) Alien resident of Puerto Rico. For purposes of this section the 
term ``nonresident alien individual'' includes an alien resident of 
Puerto Rico.
    (h) Other rules for withholding of tax under section 1451. The rules 
for withholding stated in paragraphs (c) (2) and (3), (f), and (g) of 
Sec. 1.1441-3 shall also apply for purposes of withholding the tax 
under this section.

Sec. 1.1451-2  Exemptions from withholding under section 1451.

    (a) Claiming personal exemptions. Withholding under Sec. 1.1451-1 
from interest on bonds or other obligations of corporations issued 
before January 1, 1934, and containing a tax-free covenant shall not be 
required if there is filed with the withholding agent when presenting 
coupons for payment, or not later than February 1 of the following year, 
an ownership certificate on Form 1000 stating:
    (1) In the case of a citizen or resident of the United States, that 
his taxable income does not exceed his deductions for personal 
exemptions allowed under section 151; or
    (2) In the case of an estate or trust the fiduciary of which is a 
citizen or resident of the United States, that its taxable income does 
not exceed the deduction for the personal exemption allowed under 
section 642(b).
    (b) Claiming residence in United States. To claim residence in the 
United States for purposes of section 1451, see Sec. 1.1441-5.
    (c) Other exemptions. The exemptions allowed by paragraphs (d) and 
(h) of Sec. 1.1441-4 shall also apply for purposes of section 1451.

                  APPLICATION OF WITHHOLDING PROVISIONS


<R05>
Sec. 1.1461-1  Payment and returns of tax withheld.

    (a) Payment of withheld tax--(1) Deposits of tax. Every withholding 
agent who withholds tax pursuant to chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue 
Code (Code) and the regulations under such chapter shall deposit such 
amount of tax with an authorized financial institution as provided in 
Sec. 1.6302-2(a). If for any reason the total amount of tax required to 
be returned for any calendar year pursuant to paragraph (b) of this 
section has not been deposited pursuant to Sec. 1.6302-2, the 
withholding agent shall pay the balance of tax due for such year at such 
place as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) shall specify. The tax shall 
be paid when filing the return required under paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section for such year, unless the IRS specifies otherwise.
    (2) Penalties for failure to pay tax. For penalties and additions to 
the tax for failure to timely pay the tax required to be withheld under 
chapter 3 of the Code, see sections 6656, 6672, and 7202 and the 
regulations under those sections.
    (b) Income tax return--(1) General rule. A withholding agent shall 
make an income tax return on Form 1042 (or such other form as the IRS 
may prescribe) for income paid during the preceding calendar year that 
the withholding agent is required to report on an information return on 
Form 1042-S (or such other form as the IRS may prescribe) under 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section. See section 6011 and Sec. 1.6011-
1(c). The withholding agent must file the return on or before March 15 
of the calendar year following the year in which the income was paid. 
The return must show the aggregate amount of income paid and tax 
withheld required to be reported on all the Forms 1042-S for the 
preceding calendar year by the withholding agent, in addition to such 
information as is required by the form and accompanying instructions. 
Withholding certificates or other statements or information provided to 
a withholding agent are not required to be attached to the return. A 
return must be filed under this paragraph (b)(1) even though no tax was 
required to be withheld during the preceding calendar year. The 
withholding agent must retain a copy of Form 1042 for the applicable 
statute of limitations on assessments and collection with respect to the 
amounts required to be reported on the Form 1042. See section 6501 and 
the regulations thereunder for the applicable statute of limitations. 
Adjustments to the total amount of tax withheld, as described in Sec. 
1.1461-2, shall be stated on the return as prescribed by the form and 
accompanying instructions.
    (2) Amended returns. An amended return may be filed on a Form 1042 
or such other form as the IRS may prescribe. An amended return must 
include such information as the form or accompanying instructions shall 
require, including, with respect to any information that has changed 
from the

[[Page 206]]

time of the filing of the return, the information that was shown on the 
original return and the corrected information.
    (c) Information returns--(1) Filing requirement--(i) In general. A 
withholding agent (other than an individual who is not acting in the 
course of a trade or business with respect to a payment) must make an 
information return on Form 1042-S (or such other form as the IRS may 
prescribe) to report the amounts subject to reporting, as defined in 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section, that were paid during the preceding 
calendar year. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, any person that 
withholds or is required to withhold an amount under sections 1441, 
1442, or 1443 must file a Form 1042-S for the payment withheld upon 
whether or not that person is engaged in a trade or business and whether 
or not the payment is an amount subject to reporting. A Form 1042-S 
shall be prepared for each recipient of an amount subject to reporting. 
The Form 1042-S shall be prepared in such manner as the form and 
accompanying instructions prescribe. One copy of the Form 1042-S shall 
be filed with the IRS on or before March 15 of the calendar year 
following the year in which the amount subject to reporting was paid. It 
shall be filed with a transmittal form as provided in the instructions 
to the Form 1042-S and to the transmittal form. Withholding 
certificates, documentary evidence, or other statements or documentation 
provided to a withholding agent are not required to be attached to the 
form. Another copy of the Form 1042-S must be furnished to the recipient 
for whom the form is prepared (or any other person, as required under 
this paragraph (c) or the instructions to the form) on or before March 
15 of the calendar year following the year in which the amount subject 
to reporting was paid. The withholding agent must retain a copy of each 
Form 1042-S for the statute of limitations on assessment and collection 
applicable to the Form 1042 to which the Form 1042-S relates.
    (ii) Recipient--(A) Defined. For purposes of this section, the term 
recipient means--
    (1) A beneficial owner as defined in Sec. 1.1441-1(c)(6), including 
a foreign estate or a foreign complex trust, as defined in Sec. 1.1441-
1(c)(25);
    (2) A qualified intermediary as defined in Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(5)(ii);
    (3) A withholding foreign partnership as defined in Sec. 1.1441-
5(c)(2) or a withholding foreign trust under Sec. 1.1441-5(e)(5)(v);
    (4) An authorized foreign agent as defined in Sec. 1.1441-7(c);
    (5) A U.S. branch that is treated as a U.S. person under Sec. 
1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv)(A);
    (6) A nonwithholding foreign partnership or a foreign simple trust 
as defined in Sec. 1.1441-1(c)(24), but only to the extent the income 
is (or is treated as) effectively connected with the conduct of a trade 
or business in the United States by such entity;
    (7) A payee, as defined in Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(2) that is presumed to 
be a foreign person under the presumption rules of Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3); 
1.1441-5(d) or (e)(6), or 1.6049-5(d); and
    (8) Any other person as required on Form 1042-S or the instructions 
to the form.
    (B) Persons that are not recipients. A recipient does not include--
    (1) A nonqualified intermediary;
    (2) A payment to a wholly-owned entity that is disregarded under 
Sec. 301.7701-2(c)(2) of this chapter as an entity separate from its 
owner;
    (3) A flow-through entity, as defined in Sec. 1.1441-1(c)(23) (to 
the extent it is receiving amounts subject to reporting other than 
income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in 
the United States); and
    (4) A U.S. branch described in Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv) that is not 
treated as a U.S. person under that section.
    (2) Amounts subject to reporting--(i) In general. Subject to the 
exceptions described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, amounts 
subject to reporting on Form 1042-S are amounts paid to a foreign payee 
(including persons presumed to be foreign) that are amounts subject to 
withholding as defined in Sec. 1.1441-2(a). Amounts subject to 
reporting include amounts subject to withholding even if no amount is 
deducted and withheld from the payment because of a treaty or Internal 
Revenue Code exception to taxation or because

[[Page 207]]

an amount withheld was reimbursed to the payee under the adjustment 
procedures of Sec. 1.1461-2. In addition, amounts subject to reporting 
include any amounts paid to a foreign payee on which a withholding agent 
withheld an amount (either under chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code 
or section 3406) whether or not the amount is subject to withholding. 
Amounts subject to reporting include, but are not limited to, the 
following items--
    (A) The entire amount of a corporate distribution (whether actual or 
deemed) irrespective of any estimate of the portion of the distribution 
that represents a taxable dividend;
    (B) Interest, including the portion of a notional principal contract 
payment that is characterized as interest. Interest shall also be 
reported on Form 1042-S if it is bank deposit interest paid to 
nonresident alien individuals as required under Sec. 1.6049-8;
    (C) Rents;
    (D) Royalties;
    (E) Compensation for dependent and independent personal services 
performed in the United States;
    (F) Annuities;
    (G) Pension distributions and other deferred income;
    (H) Gambling winnings that are not exempt from tax under section 
871(j);
    (I) Income from the cancellation of indebtedness unless the 
withholding agent is unrelated to the debtor and does not have knowledge 
of the facts that give rise to the payment (see Sec. 1.1441-2(d));
    (J) Amounts that are (or are presumed to be) effectively connected 
with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States (including 
deposit interest as defined in sections 871(i)(2)(A) and 881(d)) even if 
no withholding certificate is required to be furnished by the payee or 
beneficial owner. In the case of amounts paid on a notional principal 
contract described in Sec. 1.1441-4(a)(3) that are presumed to be 
effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the 
United States, the amount required to be reported is limited to the 
amount of cash paid from the notional principal contract;
    (K) Scholarship, fellowship, or grant income and compensation for 
personal services that is not excludible from gross income under section 
117 (whether or not the taxable scholarship, fellowship, grant income, 
or compensation for personal services is exempt from tax under an income 
tax treaty) paid to foreign students, trainees, teachers, or 
researchers;
    (L) Amounts paid to foreign governments, international 
organizations, or the Bank for International Settlements, whether or not 
documentation must be provided; and
    (M) Original issue discount paid on the redemption of an OID 
obligation. The amount to be reported is the amount of OID includible in 
the gross income of the holder of the obligation, if known, or, if not 
known, the total amount of original issue discount determined as if the 
holder held the obligation from its original issuance. A withholding 
agent may determine the total amount of OID by using the most recently 
published ``List of Original Issue Discount Instruments,'' (Publication 
1212, available from the IRS Forms Distribution Centers).
    (ii) Exceptions to reporting. The amounts listed in this paragraph 
(c)(2)(ii) are not required to be reported on Form 1042-S--
    (A) Interest (including original issue discount) that is deposit 
interest under sections 871(i)(2)(A) and 881(d) and that is not 
effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the 
United States, unless reporting is required under Sec. 1.6049-8 
(regarding payments to certain foreign residents) or is interest that is 
effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the 
United States;
    (B) Interest or original issue discount on certain short-term 
obligations, described in section 871(g)(1)(B) or 881(a)(3);
    (C) Interest paid on obligations sold between interest payment dates 
and the portion of the purchase price of an OID obligation that is sold 
or exchanged in a transaction other than a redemption, unless the sale 
or exchange is part of a plan, the principal purpose of which is to 
avoid tax and the withholding agent has actual knowledge or reason to 
know of such plan (see Sec. 1.1441-2(a)(5) and (6));

[[Page 208]]

    (D) Any item required to be reported on a Form W-2, including an 
item required to be shown on Form W-2 solely by reason of Sec. 1.6041-2 
(relating to return of information for payments to employees) or Sec. 
1.6052-1 (relating to information regarding payment of wages in the form 
of group-term life insurance);
    (E) Any item required to be reported on Form 1099, and such other 
forms as are prescribed pursuant to the information reporting provisions 
of sections 6041 through 6050P and the regulations under those sections;
    (F) Amounts paid on a notional principal contract described in Sec. 
1.1441-4(a)(3)(i) that are not effectively connected with the conduct of 
a trade or business in the United States (or not treated as effectively 
connected pursuant to Sec. 1.1441-4(a)(3)(ii));
    (G) Amounts required to be reported on Form 8288 (U.S. Withholding 
Tax Return for Dispositions by Foreign Persons of U.S. Real Property 
Interests) or Form 8804 (Annual Return for Partnership Withholding Tax 
(section 1446)). A withholding agent that must report a distribution 
partly on a Form 8288 or 8804 and partly on a Form 1042-S may elect to 
report the entire amount on a Form 8288 or 8804;
    (H) Interest (including original issue discount) paid with respect 
to foreign-targeted registered obligations described in Sec. 1.871-
14(e)(2) to the extent the documentation requirements described in Sec. 
1.871-14(e)(3) and (4) are required to be satisfied (taking into account 
the provisions of Sec. 1.871-14(e)(4)(ii), if applicable;
    (I) Interest on a foreign targeted bearer obligation (see Sec. Sec. 
1.1441-1(b)(4)(i) and 1.1441-2(a));
    (J) Gain described in section 301(c)(3); and
    (K) Amounts described in Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(4)(xviii) (dealing with 
certain amounts paid by the U.S. government).
    (3) Required information. The information required to be furnished 
under this paragraph (c)(3) shall be based upon the information provided 
by or on behalf of the recipient of an amount subject to reporting (as 
corrected and supplemented based on the withholding agent's actual 
knowledge) or the presumption rules of Sec. Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3), 
1.1441-4(a); 1.1441-5(d) and (e); 1.1441-9(b)(3) or 1.6049-5(d). The 
Form 1042-S must include the following information, if applicable--
    (i) The name, address, and taxpayer identifying number of the 
withholding agent;
    (ii) A description of each category of income paid based on the 
income codes provided on the form (e.g., interest, dividends, royalties, 
etc.) and the aggregate amount in each category expressed in U.S. 
dollars;
    (iii) The rate of withholding applied or the basis for exempting the 
payment from withholding (based on exemption codes provided on the 
form);
    (iv) The name and address of the recipient;
    (v) The name and address of any nonqualified intermediary, flow-
through entity, or U.S. branch as described in Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv) 
(other than a branch that is treated as a U.S. person) to which the 
payment was made;
    (vi) The taxpayer identifying number of the recipient if required 
under Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(4)(vii) or if actually known to the withholding 
agent making the return;
    (vii) The taxpayer identifying number of a nonqualified intermediary 
or flow-through entity (to the extent it is not a recipient) or other 
flow-through entity to the extent it is known to the withholding agent;
    (viii) The country (based on the country codes provided on the form) 
of the recipient and of any nonqualified intermediary or flow-through 
entity the name of which appears on the form; and
    (ix) Such information as the form or the instructions may require in 
addition to, or in lieu of, information required under this paragraph 
(c)(3).
    (4) Method of reporting--(i) Payments by U.S. withholding agents to 
recipients. A withholding agent that is a U.S. person (other than a 
foreign branch of a U.S. person that is a qualified intermediary as 
defined in Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(5)(ii)) and that makes payments of amounts 
subject to reporting on Form 1042-S must file a separate Form 1042-S for 
each recipient who receives such amount. For purposes of this paragraph 
(c)(4), a U.S. person includes a U.S. branch described in Sec. 1.1441-

[[Page 209]]

1(e)(2)(iv)(A) or (E) that agrees to be treated as a U.S. person. Except 
as may otherwise be required on Form 1042-S or the instructions to the 
form, only payments for which the income code, exemption code, 
withholding rate and recipient code are the same may be reported on a 
single Form 1042-S. See paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section for 
reporting of payments made to a person that is not a recipient.
    (A) Payments to beneficial owners. If a U.S. withholding agent makes 
a payment directly to a beneficial owner it must complete Form 1042-S 
treating the beneficial owner as the recipient. Under the grace period 
rule of Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iv), a U.S. withholding agent may, under 
certain circumstances, treat a payee as a foreign person while the 
withholding agent awaits a valid withholding certificate. A U.S. 
withholding agent who relies on the grace period rule to treat a payee 
as a foreign person must file a Form 1042-S to report all payments on 
Form 1042-S during the period that person was presumed to be foreign 
even if that person is later determined to be a U.S. person based on 
appropriate documentation or is presumed to be a U.S. person after the 
grace period ends. In the case of joint owners, a withholding agent may 
provide a single Form 1042-S made out to the owner whose status the U.S. 
withholding agent relied upon to determine the applicable rate of 
withholding. If, however, any one of the owners requests its own Form 
1042-S, the withholding agent must furnish a Form 1042-S to the person 
who requests it. If more than one Form 1042-S is issued for a single 
payment, the aggregate amount paid and tax withheld that is reported on 
all Forms 1042-S cannot exceed the total amounts paid to joint owners 
and the tax withheld thereon.
    (B) Payments to a qualified intermediary, a withholding foreign 
partnership, or a withholding foreign trust. A U.S. withholding agent 
that makes payments to a qualified intermediary (whether or not the 
qualified intermediary assumes primary withholding responsibility), a 
withholding foreign partnership, or a withholding foreign trust shall 
complete Forms 1042-S treating the qualified intermediary or withholding 
foreign partnership as the recipient. The U.S. withholding agent must 
complete a separate Form 1042-S for each withholding rate pool. A 
withholding rate pool is a payment of a single type of income 
(determined by the income codes on Form 1042-S) that is subject to a 
single rate of withholding. A qualified intermediary that does not 
assume primary withholding responsibility on all payments it receives 
provides information regarding the proportions of income subject to a 
particular withholding rate to the withholding agent on a withholding 
statement associated with a qualified intermediary withholding 
certificate. A qualified intermediary may provide a U.S. withholding 
agent with information regarding withholding rate pools for U.S. non-
exempt recipients (as defined under Sec. 1.1441-1(c)(21)). Amounts paid 
with respect to such withholding rate pools must be reported on Form 
1099 completed for each U.S. non-exempt recipient to the extent they are 
subject to Form 1099 reporting. These amounts must not be reported on 
Form 1042-S. In addition, the qualified intermediary may provide the 
U.S. withholding agent information regarding withholding rate pools for 
U.S. persons that are exempt recipients as defined under Sec. 1.1441-
1(c)(20). If such information is provided, a U.S. withholding agent 
should not report such withholding rate pools on Form 1042-S.
    (C) Amounts paid to U.S. branches treated as U.S. persons. A U.S. 
withholding agent making a payment to a U.S. branch of a foreign person 
described in Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv) shall complete Form 1042-S as 
follows--
    (1) If the branch has provided the U.S. withholding agent with a 
withholding certificate that evidences its agreement with the 
withholding agent to be treated as a U.S. person, the U.S. withholding 
agent files Forms 1042-S treating the U.S. branch as the recipient;
    (2) If the branch has provided the U.S. withholding agent with a 
withholding certificate that transmits information regarding beneficial 
owners, qualified intermediaries, withholding foreign partnerships, or 
other recipients, the U.S. withholding agent must complete a separate 
Form 1042-S for

[[Page 210]]

each recipient whose documentation is associated with the U.S. branch's 
withholding certificate; or
    (3) If the U.S. withholding agent cannot reliably associate a 
payment with a valid withholding certificate from the U.S. branch, it 
shall treat the U.S. branch as the recipient and report the income as 
effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the 
United States.
    (D) Amounts paid to an authorized foreign agent. If a U.S. 
withholding agent makes a payment to an authorized foreign agent, the 
withholding agent files Forms 1042-S treating the authorized foreign 
agent as the recipient, provided that the authorized foreign agent 
reports the payments on Forms 1042-S to each recipient to which it makes 
payments. If the authorized foreign agent fails to report the amounts 
paid on Forms 1042-S for each recipient to which the payment is made, 
the U.S. withholding agent remains responsible for such reporting.
    (E) Dual Claims. A U.S. withholding agent may make a payment to a 
foreign entity that is simultaneously claiming a reduced rate of tax on 
its own behalf for a portion of the payment and a reduced rate on behalf 
of persons in their capacity as interest holders in that entity on the 
remaining portion. See Sec. 1.1441-6(b)(2)(iii). If the claims are 
consistent and the withholding agent accepts the multiple claims, the 
withholding agent must file a separate Form 1042-S for those payments 
for which the entity is treated as the beneficial owner and Forms 1042-S 
for each of the interest holder in the entity for which the interest 
holder is treated as the recipient. For those payments for which the 
interest holder in an entity is treated as the recipient, the U.S. 
withholding agent shall prepare the Form 1042-S in the same manner as a 
payment made to a nonqualified intermediary or flow-through entity as 
set forth in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section. If the claims are 
consistent but the withholding agent has not chosen to accept the 
multiple claims, or if the claims are inconsistent, the withholding 
agent must file a separate Form 1042-S for the person or persons it has 
chosen to treat as the recipients.
    (ii) Payments made by U.S. withholding agents to persons that are 
not recipients--(A) Amounts paid to a nonqualified intermediary, a flow-
through entity, and certain U.S. branches. If a U.S. withholding agent 
makes a payment to a nonqualified intermediary, a flow-through entity, 
or a U.S. branch described in Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv) (other than a 
branch that agrees to be treated as a U.S. person), it must complete a 
separate Form 1042-S for each recipient to the extent the withholding 
agent can reliably associate a payment with valid documentation (within 
the meaning of Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(2)(vii)) from the recipient which is 
associated with the withholding certificate provided by the nonqualified 
intermediary, flow-through entity, or U.S. branch. If a payment is made 
through tiers of nonqualified intermediaries or flow-through entities, 
the withholding agent must nevertheless complete Form 1042-S for the 
recipients to the extent it can reliably associate the payment with 
documentation from the recipients. A withholding agent that is 
completing a Form 1042-S for a recipient that receives a payment through 
a nonqualified intermediary, a flow-through entity, or a U.S. branch 
must include on the Form 1042-S the name of the nonqualified 
intermediary or flow-through entity from which the recipient directly 
receives the payment. If a U.S. withholding agent cannot reliably 
associate the payment, or any portion of the payment, with valid 
documentation from a recipient either because no such documentation has 
been provided or because the nonqualified intermediary, flow-through 
entity, or U.S. branch has failed to provide sufficient allocation 
information so that the withholding agent can associate the payment, or 
any portion thereof, with valid documentation, then the withholding 
agent must report the payments as made to an unknown recipient in 
accordance with the appropriate presumption rules for that payment. 
Thus, if under the presumption rules the payment is presumed to be made 
to a foreign person, the withholding agent must generally withhold 30 
percent of the payment and report the payment on Form 1042-S made out to 
an unknown recipient and shall also include

[[Page 211]]

the name of the nonqualified intermediary or flow-through entity that 
received the payment on behalf of the unknown recipient. If, however, 
the recipient is presumed to be a U.S. non-exempt recipient (as defined 
in Sec. 1.1441-1(c)(21)), the withholding agent must withhold on the 
payment as required under section 3406 and report the payment as made to 
an unknown recipient on the appropriate Form 1099 as required under 
chapter 61 of the Internal Revenue Code.
    (B) Disregarded entities. If a U.S. withholding agent makes a 
payment to a disregarded entity but receives a valid withholding 
certificate or other documentary evidence from a foreign person that is 
the single owner of a disregarded entity, the withholding agent must 
file a Form 1042-S treating the foreign single owner as the recipient. 
The taxpayer identifying number on the Form 1042-S, if required, must be 
the foreign single owner's TIN.
    (iii) Reporting by qualified intermediaries, withholding foreign 
partnerships, and withholding foreign trusts. A qualified intermediary, 
a withholding foreign partnership, and a withholding foreign trust shall 
report payments on Form 1042-S as provided in their agreements with the 
IRS and the instructions to the form.
    (iv) Reporting by a nonqualified intermediary, flow-through entity, 
and certain U.S. branches. A nonqualified intermediary, flow-through 
entity, or U.S. branch described in Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(2)(iv) (other than 
a U.S. branch that is treated as a U.S. person) is a withholding agent 
and must file Forms 1042-S for amounts paid to recipients in the same 
manner as a U.S. withholding agent. A Form 1042-S will not be required, 
however, if another withholding agent has reported the same amount to 
the same recipient for which the nonqualified intermediary, flow-through 
entity, or U.S. branch would be required to file a return and the entire 
amount that should be withheld from such payment has been withheld. A 
nonqualified intermediary, flow-through entity, or U.S. branch must 
report payments made to recipients to the extent it has failed to 
provide the appropriate documentation to another withholding agent 
together with the information required for that withholding agent to 
reliably associate the payment with the recipient documentation or to 
the extent it knows, or has reason to know, that less than the required 
amount has been withheld. A nonqualified intermediary or flow-through 
entity that is required to report a payment on Form 1042-S must follow 
the same rules as apply to a U.S. withholding agent under paragraph 
(c)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section.
    (v) Pro rata reporting for allocation failures. If a nonqualified 
intermediary, flow-through entity, or U.S. branch described in Sec. 
1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv) (other than a branch treated as a U.S. person) that 
uses the alternative procedures of Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iv)(D) fails to 
provide information sufficient to allocate the amount subject to 
reporting paid to a withholding rate pool to the payees identified for 
that pool, then the withholding agent shall report the payment in 
accordance with the rule provided in Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iv)(D)(6).
    (vi) Other withholding agents. Any person that is a withholding 
agent not described in paragraph (c)(4)(i), (iii), or (iv) of this 
section (e.g., a foreign person that is not a qualified intermediary, 
flow-through entity, or U.S. branch) shall file Form 1042-S in the same 
manner as a U.S. withholding agent and in accordance with the 
instructions to the form.
    (5) Magnetic media reporting. A withholding agent that makes 250 or 
more Form 1042-S information returns for a taxable year must file Form 
1042-S returns on magnetic media. See Sec. 301.6011-2 of this chapter 
for requirements applicable to a withholding agent that files Forms 
1042-S with the IRS on magnetic media and publications of the IRS 
relating to magnetic media filing.
    (d) Report of taxpayer identifying numbers. When so required under 
procedures that the IRS may prescribe in published guidance (see Sec. 
601.601(d)(2) of this chapter), a withholding agent must attach to the 
Form 1042 a list of all the taxpayer identifying numbers (and 
corresponding names) that have been furnished to the withholding agent 
and upon which the withholding agent has relied to grant a reduced rate

[[Page 212]]

of withholding and that are not otherwise required to be reported on a 
Form 1042-S under the provisions of this section.
    (e) Indemnification of withholding agent. A withholding agent is 
indemnified against the claims and demands of any person for the amount 
of any tax it deducts and withholds in accordance with the provisions of 
chapter 3 of the Code and the regulations under that chapter. A 
withholding agent that withholds based on a reasonable belief that such 
withholding is required under chapter 3 of the Code and the regulations 
under that chapter is treated for purposes of section 1461 and this 
paragraph (e) as having withheld tax in accordance with the provisions 
of chapter 3 of the Code and the regulations under that chapter. In 
addition, a withholding agent is indemnified against the claims and 
demands of any person for the amount of any payments made in accordance 
with the grace period provisions set forth in Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iv). 
This paragraph (e) does not apply to relieve a withholding agent from 
tax liability under chapter 3 of the Code or the regulations under that 
chapter.
    (f) Amounts paid not constituting gross income. Any amount withheld 
in accordance with Sec. 1.1441-3 shall be reported and paid in 
accordance with this section, even though the amount paid to the 
beneficial owner may not constitute gross income in whole or in part. 
For this purpose, a reference in this section and Sec. 1.1461-2 to an 
amount shall, where appropriate, be deemed to refer to the amount 
subject to withholding under Sec. 1.1441-3.
    (g) Extensions of time to file Forms 1042 and 1042-S. The IRS may 
grant an extension of time in which to file a Form 1042 or a Form 1042-
S. Form 2758, Application for Extension of Time to File Certain Excise, 
Income, Information, and Other Returns (or such other form as the IRS 
may prescribe), must be used to request an extension of time for a Form

Sec. 1.1461-2  Adjustments for overwithholding or underwithholding of tax.

    (a) Adjustments of overwithheld tax--(1) In general. A withholding 
agent that has overwithheld under chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code 
(Code) and made a deposit of the tax as provided in Sec. 1.6302-2(a) 
may adjust the overwithheld amount either pursuant to the reimbursement 
procedure described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section or pursuant to 
the set-off procedure described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section. 
Adjustments under this paragraph (a) may only be made within the time 
prescribed under paragraph (a) (2) or (3) of this section. After such 
time, a refund of the amount overwithheld can only be claimed by the 
beneficial owner with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) pursuant to the 
procedures described in chapter 65 of the Code. For purposes of this 
section, the term overwithholding means any amount actually withheld 
(determined before application of the adjustment procedures under this 
section) from an item of income pursuant to chapter 3 of the Code or the 
regulations thereunder in excess of the actual tax liability due, 
regardless of whether such overwithholding was in error or appeared 
correct at the time it occurred.
    (2) Reimbursement of tax--(i) General rule. Under the reimbursement 
procedure, the withholding agent repays the

[[Page 213]]

beneficial owner or payee for the amount overwithheld. In such a case, 
the withholding agent may reimburse itself by reducing, by the amount of 
tax actually repaid to the beneficial owner or payee, the amount of any 
deposit of tax made by the withholding agent under Sec. 1.6302-
2(a)(1)(iii) for any subsequent payment period occurring before the end 
of the calendar year following the calendar year of overwithholding. Any 
such reduction that occurs for a payment period in the calendar year 
following the calendar year of overwithholding shall be allowed only 
if--
    (A) The withholding agent states, on a timely filed (not including 
extensions) Form 1042-S for the calendar year of overwithholding, the 
amount of tax withheld and the amount of any actual repayment; and
    (B) The withholding agent states on a timely filed (not including 
extensions) Form 1042 for the calendar year of overwithholding, that the 
filing of the Form 1042 constitutes a claim for credit in accordance 
with Sec. 1.6414-1.
    (ii) Record maintenance. If the beneficial owner is repaid an amount 
of withholding tax under the provisions of this paragraph (a)(2), the 
withholding agent shall keep as part of its records a receipt showing 
the date and amount of repayment and the withholding agent must provide 
a copy of such receipt to the beneficial owner. For this purpose, a 
canceled check or an entry in a statement is sufficient provided that 
the check or statement contains a specific notation that it is a refund 
of tax overwithheld.
    (3) Set-offs. Under the set-off procedure, the withholding agent may 
repay the beneficial owner or payee by applying the amount overwithheld 
against any amount which otherwise would be required under chapter 3 of 
the Code or the regulations thereunder to be withheld from income paid 
by the withholding agent to such person before the earlier of the due 
date (without regard to extensions) for filing the Form 1042-S for the 
calendar year of overwithholding or the date that the Form 1042-S is 
actually filed with the IRS. For purposes of making a return on Form 
1042 or 1042-S (or an amended form) for the calendar year of 
overwithholding and for purposes of making a deposit of the amount 
withheld, the reduced amount shall be considered the amount required to 
be withheld from such income under chapter 3 of the Code and the 
regulations thereunder.
    (4) Examples. The principles of this paragraph (a) are illustrated 
by the following examples:

    Example 1. (i) N is a nonresident alien individual who is a resident 
of the United Kingdom. In December 2001, a domestic corporation C pays a 
dividend of $100 to N, at which time C withholds $30 and remits the 
balance of $70 to N. On February 10, 2002, prior to the time that C 
files its Form 1042, N furnishes a valid Form W-8 described in Sec. 
1.1441-1(e)(2)(i) upon which C may rely to reduce the rate of 
withholding to 15 percent under the provisions of the U.S.-U.K. tax 
treaty. Consequently, N advises C that its tax liability is only $15 and 
not $30 and requests reimbursement of $15. Although C has already 
deposited the $30 that was withheld, as required by Sec. 1.6302-
2(a)(1)(iv), C repays N in the amount of $15.
    (ii) During 2001, C makes no other payments upon which tax is 
required to be withheld under chapter 3 of the Code; accordingly, its 
return on Form 1042 for such year, which is filed on March 15, 2002, 
shows total tax withheld of $30, an adjusted total tax withheld of $15, 
and $30 previously paid for such year. Pursuant to Sec. 1.6414-1(b), C 
claims a credit for the overpayment of $15 shown on the Form 1042 for 
2001. Accordingly, it is permitted to reduce by $15 any deposit required 
by Sec. 1.6302-2 to be made of tax withheld during the calendar year 
2002. The Form 1042-S required to be filed by C with respect to the 
dividend of $100 paid to N in 2001 is required to show tax withheld of 
$30 and tax released of $15.
    Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1. In addition, 
during 2002, C makes payments to N upon which it is required to withhold 
$200 under chapter 3 of the Code, all of which is withheld in June 2002. 
Pursuant to Sec. 1.6302-2(a)(1)(iii), C deposits the amount of $185 on 
July 15, 2002 ($200 less the $15 for which credit is claimed on the Form 
1042 for 2001). On March 15, 2003, C Corporation files its return on 
Form 1042 for calendar year 2002, which shows total tax withheld of 
$200, $185 previously deposited by C, and $15 allowable credit.
    Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example 1. Under Sec. 
1.6032-2(a)(1)(ii)), C is required to deposit on a quarter-monthly basis 
the tax withheld under chapter 3 of the Code. C withholds tax of $100 
between February 8 and February 15, 2002, and deposits $75 [($100x90 
percent) less $15] of the withheld tax within 3 banking days after 
February 15, 2002, and by depositing $10 [($100-$15) less

[[Page 214]]

$75] within 3 banking days after March 15, 2002.

    (b) Withholding of additional tax when underwithholding occurs. A 
withholding agent may withhold from future payments made to a beneficial 
owner the tax that should have been withheld from previous payments to 
such beneficial owner. In the alternative, the withholding agent may 
satisfy the tax from property that it holds in custody for the 
beneficial owner or property over which it has control. Such additional 
withholding or satisfaction of the tax owed may only be made before the 
date that the Form 1042 is required to be filed (not including 
extensions) for the calendar year in which the underwithholding 
occurred. See Sec. 1.6302-2 for making deposits of tax or Sec. 1.1461-
1(a) for making payment of the balance due for a calendar year.
    (c) Definition. For purposes of this section, the term payment 
period means the period for which the withholding agent is required by 
Sec. 1.6302-2(a)(1) to make a deposit of tax withheld under chapter 3 
of the Code.
    (d) Effective date. This section applies to payments made after 
December 31, 2000.

72188, Dec. 31, 1998; T.D. 8856, 64 FR 73412, Dec. 30, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 1.1462-1  Withheld tax as credit to recipient of income.

    (a) Creditable tax. The entire amount of the income from which the 
tax is required to be withheld (including amounts calculated under the 
gross-up formula in Sec. 1.1441-3(f)(1)) shall be included in gross 
income in the return required to be made by the beneficial owner of the 
income, without deduction for the amount required to be or actually 
withheld, but the amount of tax actually withheld shall be allowed as a 
credit against the total income tax computed in the beneficial owner's 
return.
    (b) Amounts paid to persons who are not the beneficial owner. 
Amounts withheld at source under chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code 
(Code) on payments to a fiduciary, partnership, or intermediary is 
deemed to have been paid by the taxpayer ultimately liable for the tax 
upon such income. Thus, for example, if a beneficiary of a trust is 
subject to the taxes imposed by section 1, 2, 3, or 11 upon any portion 
of the income received from a foreign trust, the part of any amount 
withheld at source which is properly allocable to the income so taxed to 
such beneficiary shall be credited against the amount of the income tax 
computed upon the beneficiary's return, and any excess shall be 
refunded. Further, if a partnership withholds an amount under chapter 3 
of the Code with respect to the distributive share of a partner that is 
a partnership or with respect to the distributive share of partners in 
an upper tier partnership, such amount is deemed to have been withheld 
by the upper tier partnership.
    (c) Effective date. This section applies to payments made after 
December 31, 2000.

[T.D. 8734, 62 FR 53471, Oct. 14, 1997, as amended by T.D. 8804, 63 FR 
72188, Dec. 31, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 1.1463-1  Tax paid by recipient of income.

    (a) Tax paid. If the tax required to be withheld under chapter 3 of 
the Internal Revenue Code is paid by the beneficial owner of the income 
or by the withholding agent, it shall not be re-collected from the 
other, regardless of the original liability therefor. However, this 
section does not relieve the person that did not withhold tax from 
liability for interest or any penalties or additions to tax otherwise 
applicable. See Sec. 1.1441-7(b) for additional applicable rules.
    (b) Effective date. This section applies to failures to withhold 
occurring after December 31, 2000.

[T.D. 8734, 62 FR 53471, Oct. 14, 1997, as amended by T.D. 8804, 63 FR 
72188, Dec. 31, 1998; T.D. 8856, 64 FR 73412, Dec. 30, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 1.1464-1  Refunds or credits.

    (a) In general. The refund or credit under chapter 65 of the Code of 
an overpayment of tax which has actually been withheld at the source 
under chapter 3 of the Code shall be made to the taxpayer from whose 
income the amount of such tax was in fact withheld. To the extent that 
the overpayment under chapter 3 was not in fact withheld at the source, 
but was paid,

[[Page 215]]

by the withholding agent the refund or credit under chapter 65 of the 
overpayment shall be made to the withholding agent. Thus, where a debtor 
corporation assumes liability pursuant to its tax-free covenant for the 
tax required to be withheld under chapter 3 upon interest and pays the 
tax in behalf of its bondholder, and it can be shown that the bondholder 
is not in fact liable for any tax, the overpayment of tax shall be 
credited or refunded to the withholding agent in accordance with chapter 
65 since the tax was not actually deducted and withheld from the 
interest paid to the bondholder. In further illustration, where a 
withholding agent who is required by chapter 3 to withhold $300 tax from 
rents paid to a nonresident alien individual mistakenly withholds $320 
and mistakenly pays $350 as internal revenue tax, the amount of $30 
shall be credited or refunded to the withholding agent in accordance 
with chapter 65 and the amount of $20 shall be credited or refunded in 
accordance with such chapter to the person from whose income such amount 
has been withheld.
    (b) Tax repaid to payee. For purposes of this section and Sec. 
1.6414-1, any amount of tax withheld under chapter 3 of the Code, which, 
pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of Sec. 1.1461-2, is repaid by the 
withholding agent to the person from whose income such amount was 
erroneously withheld shall be considered as tax which, within the 
meaning of sections 1464 and 6414, was not actually withheld by the 
withholding agent.

July 1, 1939, except as otherwise noted.

Sec. 16.1 Definitions. As used in the regulations in this part the 
term:
    (a) ``Act'' means the act of April 3, 1939 (53 Stat. 560; 10 U.S.C. 
311, 312, 34 U.S.C. 496), together with the applicable provisions of

organization or group, through or by means of which any business, 
financial operation or venture is carried on.
    (c) ``Contract'' means an agreement made by authority of the 
Secretary of the Army for the construction or manufacture of any 
complete aircraft or any portion thereof for the Army.
    (d) ``Contractor'' means a person entering into a direct contract 
with the Secretary of the Army or his duly authorized representative.
    (e) ``Subcontract'' means an agreement entered into by one person 
with another person for the construction or manufacture of any complete 
aircraft or any portion thereof for the Army, the prime contract for 
such aircraft or portion thereof having been entered into between a 
contractor and the Secretary of the Army or his duly authorized 
representative.
    (f) ``Subcontractor'' means any person other than a contractor 
entering into a subcontract.
    (g) ``Contracting party'' means a contractor or subcontractor as the 
case may be.
    (h) ``Contract price'' or ``total contract price'' means the amount 
or total amount to be received under a contract or subcontract as the 
case may be.

[[Page 216]]

    (i) ``Income-taxable year'' means the calendar year, the fiscal year 
ending during such calendar year, or the fractional part of such 
calendar or fiscal year, upon the basis of which the contracting party's 
net income is computed and for which its income tax returns are made for 
Federal income tax purposes.

Sec. 16.2 Contracts and subcontracts under which excess profit 
liability may be incurred. Except as otherwise provided with respect to 
contracts or subcontracts for certain scientific equipment (see Sec. 
16.3), every contract awarded for an amount exceeding $10,000 and 
entered into after the enactment of the act of April 3, 1939 for the 
construction or manufacture of any complete aircraft or any portion 
thereof for the Army, is subject to the provisions of the act relating 
to excess profit liability. Any subcontract made with respect to such a 
contract and involving an amount in excess of $10,000 is also within the 
scope of the act. If a contracting party places orders with another 
party, aggregating an amount in excess of $10,000, for articles or 
materials which constitute a part of the cost of performing the contract 
or subcontract, the placing of such orders shall constitute a 
subcontract within the scope of the act, unless it is clearly shown that 
each of the orders involving $10,000 or less is a bona fide separate and 
distinct subcontract and not a subdivision made for the purpose of 
evading the provisions of the act.

Sec. 16.3 Contracts or subcontracts for scientific equipment. No excess 
profit liability is incurred upon a contract or subcontract entered into 
after the enactment of the act of April 3, 1939, if at the time or prior 
to the time such contract or subcontract is made it is designated by the 
Secretary of the Army as being exempt under the provisions of the act 
pertaining to scientific equipment used for communication, target 
detection, navigation, and fire control.

Sec. 16.4 Completion of contract defined. The date of delivery of the 
aircraft or portion thereof covered by the contract or subcontract shall 
be considered the date of completion of the contract or subcontract 
unless otherwise determined jointly by the Secretary of the Army and the 
Secretary of the Treasury or their duly authorized representatives. 
Except as otherwise provided in the preceding sentence, the replacement 
of defective parts or delivered articles or the performance of other 
guarantee work in respect of such articles will not operate to extend 
the date of completion. As to the treatment of the cost of such work as 
a cost of performing a contract or subcontract, see Sec. 16.8(h). As to 
a refund in case of adjustment due to any subsequently incurred 
additional costs, see Sec. 16.18. If a contract or subcontract is at 
any time cancelled or terminated, it is completed at the time of the 
cancellation or termination.

Sec. 16.5 Manner of determining liability. (a) The first step in the 
determination of the excess profit to be paid to the United States by a 
contracting party with respect to contracts and subcontracts completed 
within an income-taxable year is to ascertain the total contract prices 
of all contracts and subcontracts completed by the contracting party 
within the income-taxable year. As to total contract prices, see Sec. 
16.7.
    (b) The second step is to ascertain the cost of performing such 
contracts and subcontracts and to deduct such cost from the total 
contract prices of such contracts and subcontracts as computed in the 
first step. See Sec. 16.8. The amount remaining after such subtraction 
is the amount of net profit or net loss upon the contracts and 
subcontracts completed within the income-taxable year.
    (c) The third step, in case there is a net profit upon such 
contracts and subcontracts, is to subtract from the amount of such net 
profit as computed in the second step the sum of:
    (1) An amount equal to 12 percent of the total contract prices of 
the contracts and subcontracts completed within the income- taxable 
year;
    (2) The amount of any net loss allowable as a credit in determining 
the excess profit for the income-taxable year (see Sec. 16.9); and
    (3) The amount of any deficiency in profit allowable as a credit in 
determining the excess profit for the income-taxable year (see Sec. 
16.9). The amount remaining after such subtraction is the amount of 
excess profit for the income-taxable year.
    (d) The fourth step is to ascertain the amount of credit allowed for 
Federal income taxes paid or remaining to be paid upon the amount of 
such excess profit (see Sec. 16.10) and then subtract from the amount 
of such excess profit the amount of credit for Federal income taxes. The 
amount remaining after this subtraction is the amount of excess profit 
to be paid to the United States by the contracting party for the income-
taxable year.

Sec. 16.6 Computation of excess profit liability. The application of 
the provisions of Sec. 16.5 may be illustrated by the following 
example:
    Example. On September 1, 1939, the B Corporation, which keeps its 
books and makes its Federal income tax returns on a calendar year basis, 
entered into a contract for the construction of Army aircraft coming 
within the scope of the act, the total contract price of which was 
$200,000. On March 10, 1940, the corporation entered into another such 
contract, the total contract price of which was $40,000. Both contracts 
were completed within the calendar year 1940, the first at a cost

[[Page 217]]

of $155,000 and the second at a cost of $45,000. During the year 1940, 
the B Corporation also completed at a deficiency in profit of $2,000 a 
contract entered into after April 3, 1939, for the construction of naval 
aircraft coming within the scope of 10 U.S.C. 2382 (formerly section 3 
of the Act of March 27, 1934 (48 Stat. 505)). For the year 1939, the B 
Corporation sustained a net loss of $1,500 and a deficiency in profit of 
$1,000 on all contracts and subcontracts entered into after April 3, 
1939, for Army aircraft coming within the scope of the act and completed 
within the calendar year 1939. For the year 1939, the B Corporation also 
sustained a net loss of $1,000 on a contract, entered into after April 
3, 1939, and completed within the calendar year 1939, for naval aircraft 
coming within the scope of 10 U.S.C. 2382 (formerly section 3 of the Act 
of March 27, 1934 (48 Stat. 505)). For purposes of the Federal income 
tax, the net income of the B Corporation for the year 1940, on which the 
tax was paid, amounted to $96,000, which included the total net profit 
of $40,000 upon the two contracts entered into on September 1, 1939, and 
March 10, 1940. The excess profit liability is $4,332, computed as 
follows:

Total contract prices:
  Contract No. 1................................    $200,000
  Contract No. 2................................      40,000

Sec. 16.7 Total contract price. The total contract price of a 
particular contract or subcontract (see Sec. 16.1) may be received in 
money or its equivalent. If something other than money is received, only 
the fair market value of the thing received, at the date of receipt, is 
to be included in determining the amount received. Bonuses earned for 
bettering performance and penalties incurred for failure to meet the 
contract guarantees are to be regarded as adjustments of the original 
contract price. Trade or other discounts granted by a contracting party 
in respect of a contract or subcontract performed by such party are also 
to be deducted in determining the true total contract price of such 
contract or subcontract.

Sec. 16.8 Cost of performing a contract or subcontract.--(a) General 
rule. The cost of performing a particular contract or subcontract shall 
be the sum of (1) the direct costs, including therein expenditures for 
materials, direct labor and direct expenses, incurred by the contracting 
party in performing the contract or subcontract; and (2) the proper 
proportion of any indirect costs (including therein a reasonable 
proportion of management expenses) incident to and necessary for the 
performance of the contract or subcontract.
    (b) Elements of cost. No definitions of the elements of cost may be 
stated which are of invariable application to all contractors and 
subcontractors. In general, the elements of cost may be defined for 
purposes of the act as follows:
    (1) Manufacturing cost, which is the sum of factory cost (see 
paragraph (c) of this section) and other manufacturing cost (see 
paragraph (d) of this section);
    (2) Miscellaneous direct expenses (see paragraph (e) of this 
section);
    (3) General expenses, which are the sum of indirect engineering 
expenses, usually termed ``engineering overhead'' (see paragraph (f) of 
this section) and expenses of distribution, servicing and administration 
(see paragraph (g) of this section); and
    (4) Guarantee expenses (see paragraph (h) of this section).
    (c) Factory cost. Factory cost is the sum of the following:
    (1) Direct materials. Materials, such as those purchased for stock 
and subsequently issued for contract operations and those acquired under 
subcontracts, which become a component part of the finished product or 
which are used directly in fabricating, converting or processing such 
materials or parts.
    (2) Direct productive labor. Productive labor, usually termed ``shop 
labor,'' which is performed on and is properly chargeable directly to 
the article manufactured or constructed pursuant to the contract or 
subcontract, but which ordinarily does not include direct engineering 
labor (see subparagraph (3) of this paragraph).
    (3) Direct engineering labor. The compensation of professional 
engineers and other technicists (including reasonable advisory

[[Page 218]]

fees), and of draftsmen, properly chargeable directly to the cost of the 
contract or subcontract.
    (4) Miscellaneous direct factory charges. Items which are properly 
chargeable directly to the factory cost of performing the contract or 
subcontract but which do not come within the classifications in 
subparagraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this paragraph, as for example, 
royalties which the contracting party pays to another party and which 
are properly chargeable to the cost of performing the contract or 
subcontract (but see paragraph (d) of this section).
    (5) Indirect factory expenses. Items, usually termed ``factory 
overhead,'' which are not directly chargeable to the factory cost of 
performing the contract or subcontract but which are properly incident 
to and necessary for the performance of the contract or subcontract and 
consist of the following:
    (i) Labor. Amounts expended for factory labor, such as supervision 
and inspection, clerical labor, timekeeping, packing and shipping, 
stores supply, services of tool crib attendants, and services in the 
factory employment bureau, which are not chargeable directly to 
productive labor of the contract or subcontract.
    (ii) Materials and supplies. The cost of materials and supplies for 
general use in the factory in current operations, such as shop fuel, 
lubricants, heat-treating, plating, cleaning and anodizing supplies, 
nondurable tools and gauges, stationery (such as time tickets and other 
forms), and boxing and wrapping materials.
    (iii) Service expenses. Factory expenses of a general nature, such 
as those for power, heat and light (whether purchased or produced), 
ventilation and air-conditioning and operation and maintenance of 
general plant assets and facilities.
    (iv) Fixed charges and obsolescence. Recurring charges with respect 
to property used for manufacturing purposes of the contract or 
subcontract, such as premiums for fire and elevator insurance, property 
taxes, rentals and allowances for depreciation of such property, 
including maintenance and depreciation of reasonable stand-by equipment; 
and depreciation and obsolescence of special equipment and facilities 
necessarily acquired primarily for the performance of the contract or 
subcontract. In making allowances for depreciation, consideration shall 
be given to the number and length of shifts.
    (v) Miscellaneous indirect factory expenses. Miscellaneous factory 
expenses not directly chargeable to the factory cost of performing the 
contract or subcontract, such as purchasing expenses; ordinary and 
necessary expenses of rearranging facilities within a department or 
plant; employees' welfare expenses; premiums or dues on compensation 
insurance; employers' payments to unemployment, old age and social 
security Federal and State funds not including payments deducted from or 
chargeable to employees or officers; pensions and retirement payments to 
factory employees; factory accident compensation (as to self-insurance, 
see paragraph (g) of this section); but not including any amounts which 
are not incident to services, operations, plant, equipment or facilities 
involved in the performance of the contract or subcontract.
    (d) Other manufacturing cost. Other manufacturing cost as used in 
paragraph (b) of this section includes items of manufacturing costs 
which are not properly or satisfactorily chargeable to factory costs 
(see paragraph (c) of this section) but which upon a complete showing of 
all pertinent facts are properly to be included as a cost of performing 
the contract or subcontract, as for instance, payments of royalties and 
amortization of the cost of designs purchased and patent rights over 
their useful life; and ``deferred'' or ``unliquidated'' experimental and 
development charges. For example, in case experimental and development 
costs have been properly deferred or capitalized and are amortized in 
accordance with a reasonably consistent plan, a proper portion of the 
current charge, determined by a ratable allocation which is reasonable 
in consideration of the pertinent facts, may be treated as a cost of 
performing the contract or subcontract. In the case of general 
experimental and development expenses which may be charged off 
currently, a reasonable portion thereof may be allocated to the cost of 
performing the contract or subcontract. If a special experimental or 
development project is carried on in pursuance of a contract, or in 
anticipation of a contract which is later entered into, and the expense 
is not treated as a part of general experimental and development 
expenses or is not otherwise allowed as a cost of performing the 
contract, there clearly appearing no reasonable prospect of an 
additional contract for the type of article involved, the entire cost of 
such project may be allowed as a part of the cost of performing the 
contract.
    (e) Miscellaneous direct expenses. Miscellaneous direct expenses as 
used in paragraph (b) of this section include:
    (1) Cost of installation and construction. Cost of installation and 
construction includes the cost of materials, labor and expenses 
necessary for the erection and installation prior to the completion of 
the contract and after the delivery of the product or material 
manufactured or constructed pursuant to the contract or subcontract.
    (2) Sundry direct expenses. Items of expense which are properly 
chargeable directly to the cost of performing a contract or subcontract 
and which do not constitute guarantee expenses (see paragraph (h) of 
this section) or direct costs classified as factory cost or other 
manufacturing cost (see paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section), such as 
premiums on

[[Page 219]]

performance or other bonds required under the contract or subcontract; 
State sales taxes imposed on the contracting party; freight on outgoing 
shipments; fees paid for wind tunnel and model basin tests; 
demonstration and test expenses; crash insurance premiums; traveling 
expenses. In order for any such item to be allowed as a charge directly 
to the cost of performing a contract or subcontract, (i) a detailed 
record shall be kept by the contracting party of all items of a similar 
character, and (ii) no item of a similar character which is properly a 
direct charge to other work shall be allowed as a part of any indirect 
expenses in determining the proper proportion thereof chargeable to the 
cost of performing the contract or subcontract. As to allowable indirect 
expenses, see paragraphs (c)(5), (f), (g) and (j) of this section.
    (f) Indirect engineering expenses. Indirect engineering expenses, 
usually termed ``engineering overhead,'' which are treated in this 
section as a part of general expenses in determining the cost of 
performing a contract or subcontract (see paragraph (b) of this 
section), comprise the general engineering expenses which are incident 
to and necessary for the performance of the contract or subcontract, 
such as the following:
    (1) Labor. Reasonable fees of engineers employed in a general 
consulting capacity, and compensation of employees for personal services 
to the engineering department, such as supervision, which is properly 
chargeable to the contract or subcontract, but which is not chargeable 
as direct engineering labor (see paragraph (c)(3) of this section).
    (2) Material. Supplies for the engineering department, such as paper 
and ink for drafting and similar supplies.
    (3) Miscellaneous expenses. Expenses of the engineering department, 
such as (i) maintenance and repair of engineering equipment, and (ii) 
services purchased outside of the engineering department for blue 
printing, drawing, computing, and like purposes.
    (g) Expenses of distribution, servicing and administration. Expenses 
of distribution, servicing and administration, which are treated in this 
section as a part of general expenses in determining the cost of 
performing a contract or subcontract (see paragraph (b) of this 
section), comprehend the expenses incident to and necessary for the 
performance of the contract or subcontract, which are incurred in 
connection with the distribution and general servicing of the 
contracting party's products and the general administration of the 
business, such as:
    (1) Compensation for personal services of employees. The salaries of 
the corporate and general executive officers and the salaries and wages 
of administrative clerical employees and of the office services 
employees such as telephone operators, janitors, cleaners, watchmen and 
office equipment repairmen.
    (2) Bidding and general selling expenses. Bidding and general 
selling expenses which by reference to all the pertinent facts and 
circumstances reasonably constitute a part of the cost of performing a 
contract or subcontract. The treatment of bidding and general selling 
expenses as a part of general expenses in accordance with this paragraph 
is in lieu of any direct charges which otherwise might be made for such 
expenses. The term ``bidding expenses'' as used in this section includes 
all expenses in connection with preparing and submitting bids.
    (3) General servicing expenses. Expenses which by reference to all 
the pertinent facts and circumstances reasonably constitute a part of 
the cost of performing a contract or subcontract and which are incident 
to delivered or installed articles and are due to ordinary adjustments 
or minor defects; but including no items which are treated as a part of 
guarantee expenses (see paragraph (h) of this section) or as a part of 
direct costs, such as direct materials, direct labor, and other direct 
expense.
    (4) Other expenses. Miscellaneous office and administrative 
expenses, such as stationery and office supplies; postage; repair and 
depreciation of office equipment; contributions to local charitable or 
community organizations to the extent constituting ordinary and 
necessary business expenses; employees' welfare expenses; premiums and 
dues on compensation insurance; employers' payments to unemployment, old 
age and social security Federal and State funds not including payments 
deducted from or chargeable to employees or officers; pensions and 
retirement payments to administrative office employees and accident 
compensation to office employees (as to self-insurance, see subdivision 
(i) of this subparagraph.
    (i) Subject to the exception stated in this subdivision, in cases 
where a contracting party assumes its own insurable risks (usually 
termed ``self-insurance''), losses and payments will be allowed in the 
cost of performing a contract or subcontract only to the extent of the 
actual losses suffered or payments incurred during, and in the course 
of, the performance of the contract or subcontract and properly 
chargeable to such contract or subcontract. If however, a contracting 
party assumes its own insurable risks (a) for compensation paid to 
employees for injuries received in the performance of their duties, or 
(b) for unemployment risks in States where insurance is required, there 
may be allowed as a part of the cost of performing a contract or 
subcontract a reasonable portion of the charges set up for purposes of 
self-insurance under a system of accounting regularly employed by the 
contracting party, as determined by the Commissioner of Internal 
Revenue, at rates not

[[Page 220]]

exceeding the lawful or approved rates of insurance companies for such 
insurance, reduced by amounts representing the acquisition cost in such 
companies, provided the contracting party adopts and consistently 
follows this method with respect to self-insurance in connection with 
all contracts and subcontracts subsequently performed by him.
    (ii) Allowances for interest on invested capital are not allowable 
as costs of performing a contract or subcontract.
    (iii) Among the items which shall not be included as a part of the 
cost of performing a contract or subcontract or considered in 
determining such cost, are the following: Entertainment expenses; dues 
and memberships other than of regular trade associations; donations 
except as otherwise provided above; losses on other contracts; profits 
or losses from sales or exchanges of capital assets; extraordinary 
expenses due to strikes or lockouts; fines and penalties; amortization 
of unrealized appreciation of values of assets; expenses, maintenance 
and depreciation of excess facilities (including idle land and building, 
idle parts of a building, and excess machinery and equipment) vacated or 
abandoned, or not adaptable for future use in performing contracts or 
subcontracts; increases in reserve accounts for contingencies, repairs, 
compensation insurance (except as above provided with respect to self-
insurance) and guarantee work; Federal and State income and excess-
profits taxes and surtaxes; cash discount earned up to one percent of 
the amount of the purchase, except that all discounts on subcontracts 
subject to the act will be considered; interest incurred or earned; bond 
discount or finance charges; premiums for life insurance on the lives of 
officers; legal and accounting fees in connection with reorganizations, 
security issues, capital stock issues and the prosecution of claims 
against the United State (including income tax matters); taxes and 
expenses on issues and transfers of capital stock; losses on 
investments; bad debts; and expenses of collection and exchange.
    (iv) In order that the cost of performing a contract or subcontract 
may be accounted for clearly, the amount of any excess profits repayable 
to the United States pursuant to the act should not be charged to or 
included in such cost.
    (h) Guarantee expenses. Guarantee expenses include the various items 
of factory cost, other manufacturing cost, cost of installation and 
construction, indirect engineering expenses and other general expenses 
(see paragraphs (c) to (g), of this section) which are incurred after 
delivery or installation of the article manufactured or constructed 
pursuant to the particular contract or subcontract and which are 
incident to the correction of defects or deficiencies which the 
contracting party is required to make under the guarantee provisions of 
the particular contract or subcontract. If the total amount of such 
guarantee expenses is not ascertainable at the time of filing the report 
required to be filed with the district director of internal revenue (see 
Sec. 16.15) and the contracting party includes any estimated amount of 
such expenses as part of the claimed total cost of performing the 
contract or subcontract, such estimated amount shall be separately shown 
on the report and the reasons for claiming such estimated amount shall 
accompany the report; but only the amount of guarantee expenses actually 
incurred will be allowed. If the amount of guarantee expenses actually 
incurred is greater than the amount (if any) claimed on the report and 
the contracting party has made an overpayment of excess profit, a refund 
of the overpayment shall be made in accordance with the provisions of 
Sec. 16.18. If the amount of guarantee expenses actually incurred is 
less than the amount claimed on the report and an additional amount of 
excess profit is determined to be due, the additional amount of excess 
profit shall be assessed and paid in accordance with the provisions of 
Sec. 16.18.
    (i) Unreasonable compensation. (1) The salaries and compensation for 
services which are treated as a part of the cost of performing a 
contract or subcontract include reasonable payments for salaries, 
bonuses, or other compensation for services. As a general rule, bonuses 
paid to employees (and not to officers) in pursuance of a regularly 
established incentive bonus system may be allowed as a part of the cost 
of performing a contract or subcontract.
    (2) The test of allowability is whether the aggregate compensation 
paid to each individual is for services actually rendered incident to, 
and necessary for, the performance of the contract or subcontract, and 
is reasonable. Excessive or unreasonable payments, whether in cash, 
stock or other property ostensibly as compensation for services shall 
not be included in the cost of performing a contract or subcontract.
    (j) Allocation of indirect costs. No general rule applicable to all 
cases may be stated for ascertaining the proper proportion of the 
indirect costs to be allocated to the cost of performing a particular 
contract or subcontract. Such proper proportion depends upon all the 
facts and circumstances relating to the performance of the particular 
contract or subcontract. Subject to a requirement that all items which 
have no relation to the performance of the contract or subcontract shall 
be eliminated from the amount to be allocated, the following methods of 
allocation are outlined as acceptable in a majority of cases:
    (1) Factory indirect expenses. The allowable indirect factory 
expenses (see paragraph

[[Page 221]]

(c)(5) of this section) shall ordinarily be allocated or ``distributed'' 
to the cost of the contract or subcontract on the basis of the 
proportion which the direct productive labor (see paragraph (c)(2) of 
this section) attributable to the contract or subcontract bears to the 
total direct productive labor of the production department or particular 
section thereof during the period within which the contract or 
subcontract is performed, except that if the indirect factory expenses 
are incurred in different amounts and in different proportions by the 
various producing departments consideration shall be given to such 
circumstances to the extent necessary to make a fair and reasonable 
determination of the true profit and excess profit.
    (2) Engineering indirect expenses. The allowable indirect 
engineering expenses (see paragraph (f) of this section) shall 
ordinarily be allocated or ``distributed'' to the cost of the contract 
or subcontract on the basis of the proportion which the direct 
engineering labor attributable to the contract or subcontract (see 
paragraph (c)(3) of this section) bears to the total direct engineering 
labor of the engineering department or particular section thereof during 
the period within which the contract or subcontract is performed. If the 
expenses of the engineering department are not sufficient in amount to 
require the maintenance of separate accounts, the engineering indirect 
costs may be included in the indirect factory expenses (see paragraph 
(c)(5) of this section) and allocated or distributed to the cost of 
performing the contract or subcontract as a part of such expenses, 
provided the proportion so allocated or distributed is proper under the 
facts and circumstances relating to the performance of the particular 
contract or subcontract.
    (3) Administrative expenses (or ``overhead''). The allowable 
expenses of administration (see paragraph (g) of this section) or other 
general expenses except indirect engineering expenses, bidding and 
general selling expenses, and general servicing expenses shall 
ordinarily be allocated or distributed to the cost of performing a 
contract or subcontract on the basis of the proportion which the sum of 
the manufacturing cost (see paragraph (b) of this section) and the cost 
of installation and construction (see paragraph (e) of this section) 
attributable to the particular contract or subcontract bears to the sum 
of the total manufacturing cost and the total cost of installation and 
construction during the period within which the contract or subcontract 
is performed.
    (4) Bidding, general selling, and general servicing expenses. The 
allowable bidding and general selling expenses and general servicing 
expenses (see paragraph (g) (2) and (3) of this section) shall 
ordinarily be allocated or distributed to the cost of performing a 
contract or subcontract on the basis of:
    (i) The proportion which the contract price of the particular 
contract or subcontract bears to the total sales made(including 
contracts or subcontracts completed) during the period within which the 
particular contract or subcontracts is performed, or
    (ii) The proportion which the sum of the manufacturing cost (see 
paragraph (b) of this section) and the cost of installation and 
construction (see paragraph (e) of this section) attributable to the 
particular contract or subcontract bears to the sum of the total 
manufacturing cost and the total cost of installation and construction 
during the period within which the contract or subcontract is performed,

except that special consideration shall be given to the relation which 
certain classes of such expenses bear to the various classes of articles 
produced by the contracting party in each case in which such 
consideration is necessary in order to make a fair and reasonable 
determination of the true profit and excess profit. See Sec. 16.13.

Sec. 16.9 Credit for net loss or for deficiency in profit in computing 
excess profit. (a) The term ``net loss'' as used in the act and as 
applied to contracts and subcontracts for aircraft or portions thereof 
coming within the regulations prescribed under the act or under 10 
U.S.C. 2382 (formerly section 3 of the Act of March 27, 1934 (48 Stat. 
505)) means the amount by which the total cost of performing all such 
contracts and subcontracts for aircraft entered into after April 3, 
1939, and completed by a particular contracting party within the income-
taxable year exceeds the total contract prices of such contracts and 
subcontracts. As to the meaning of income-taxable year, see Sec. 16.1.
    (b) The term ``deficiency in profit'', as used in the act and as 
applied to contracts and subcontracts for aircraft or portions thereof 
coming within the regulations prescribed under the act or under 10 
U.S.C. 2882 (formerly section 3 of the Act of March 27, 1934 (48 Stat. 
505)), means the amount by which 12 percent of the total contract prices 
of all such contracts and subcontracts for aircraft entered into after 
April 3, 1939, and completed by a particular contracting party within 
the income-taxable year exceeds the net profit upon all such contracts 
and subcontracts.
    (c) A net loss or a deficiency in profit sustained by a contracting 
party for an income-taxable year is allowable as a credit in computing 
the contracting party's excess profit on contracts and subcontracts for 
aircraft coming within the regulations prescribed under the act or under 
10 U.S.C. 2382 (formerly section 3 of the Act of March 27, 1934 (48 
Stat. 505)) and completed during the four next succeeding income-taxable 
years. Credit for such a net loss or deficiency in profit may be claimed 
in the contracting party's

[[Page 222]]

annual report of profit filed with the district director of internal 
revenue (see Sec. 16.15), but it shall be supported by separate 
schedules for each contract or subcontract involved showing total 
contract prices, costs of performance and pertinent facts relative 
thereto, together with a summarized computation of the net loss or 
deficiency in profit. The net loss or deficiency in profit claimed is 
subject to verification and adjustment. As to preservation of books and 
records, see Sec. 16.13.
    (d) Net loss or deficiency in profit sustained on contracts and 
subcontracts completed within one income-taxable year may not be 
considered in computing net loss or deficiency in profit sustained on 
contracts and subcontracts completed within another income-taxable year.
    (e) The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the 
following example:
    Example. For the calendar year 1939, the A Corporation, which keeps 
its books and makes its Federal income tax returns on a calendar year 
basis, sustained a net loss of $30,000 on the contracts and subcontracts 
for Army aircraft and portions thereof coming within the scope of the 
act and completed within that year. During the year 1939, the A 
Corporation also completed contracts for naval aircraft coming within 
the scope of 10 U.S.C. 2382 (formerly section 3 of the Act of March 27, 
1934 (48 Stat. 505)) at a deficiency in profit of $10,000. In 1940, the 
A Corporation completed similar contracts for Army aircraft totaling 
$175,000 at a cost of $155,000, whereby the A Corporation realized a net 
profit of $20,000 but sustained a deficiency in profit of $1,000 (i.e., 
12 percent of $175,000, or $21,000, less $20,000. During the year 1940, 
the A Corporation also completed contracts for naval aircraft coming 
within the scope of 10 U.S.C. 2382 (formerly section 3 of the Act of 
March 27, 1934 (48 Stat. 505)) at a net loss of $2,000. In 1941, the A 
Corporation completed contracts for Army aircraft coming within the 
scope of the act totaling $400,000 at a cost of $300,000, or at a net 
profit of $100,000. After deducting from the net profit of $100,000 for 
the year 1941 the amount of $48,000 (i.e., 12 percent of the total 
contract price of $400,000), there remains $52,000 in excess profit on 
the contracts completed in the year 1941. The A Corporation may deduct 
from such $52,000, in determining the amount of excess profit it must 
pay for the year 1941 with respect to the contracts completed in such 
year, the net loss of $30,000 and the deficiency in profit of $10,000 
sustained in 1939 on Army and naval aircraft contracts, respectively, 
and the net loss of $2,000 and the deficiency in profit of $1,000 
sustained in 1940 on naval and Army aircraft contracts, respectively.

[T.D. 4909, 4 FR 2733, July 1, 1939, as amended by T.D. 6511, 25 FR 
12442, Dec. 6, 1960]

Sec. 16.10 Credit for Federal income taxes. For the purpose of 
computing the amount of excess profit to be paid to the United States, a 
credit is allowable against the excess profit for the amount of Federal 
income taxes paid or remaining to be paid on the amount of such excess 
profit. The ``Federal income taxes'' in respect of which this credit is 
allowable include the income taxes imposed by Titles I and IA of the 
Revenue Act of 1938, and Chapter 1 and Subchapter A of Chapter 2 of the 
Internal Revenue Code, and the excess-profits taxes imposed by section 
602 of the Revenue Act of 1938 and Subchapter B of Chapter 2 of the 
Internal Revenue Code. This credit is allowable for these taxes only to 
the extent that it is affirmatively shown that they have been finally 
determined and paid or remain to be paid and that they were imposed upon 
the excess profit against which the credit is to be made. In case such a 
credit has been allowed and the amount of Federal income taxes imposed 
upon the excess profit is redetermined, the credit previously allowed 
shall be adjusted accordingly.

Sec. 16.11 Failure of contractor to require agreement by subcontractor. 
(a) Every contract or subcontract coming within the scope of the act and 
the regulations in this part is required by the act to contain, among 
other things, an agreement by the contracting party to make no 
subcontract unless the subcontractor agrees:
    (1) To make a report, as described in the act, under oath to the 
Secretary of War upon the completion of the subcontract;
    (2) To pay into the Treasury excess profit, as determined by the 
Treasury Department, in the manner and amounts specified in the act;
    (3) To make no subdivision of the subcontract for the same article 
or articles for the purpose of evading the provisions of the act;
    (4) That the manufacturing spaces and books of its own plant, 
affiliates, and subdivisions shall at all times be subject to inspection 
and audit as provided in the act.
    (b) If a contracting party enters into a subcontract with a 
subcontractor who fails to make such agreement, such contracting party 
shall, in addition to its liability for excess profit determined on 
contracts or subcontracts performed by it, be liable for any excess 
profit determined to be due the United States on the subcontract entered 
into with such subcontractor. In such event, however, the excess profit 
to be paid to the United States in respect of the subcontract entered 
into with such subcontractor shall be determined separately from any 
contracts or subcontracts performed by the contracting party entering 
into the subcontract with such subcontractor.

Sec. 16.12 Evasion of excess profit. Section 3 of the act of March 27, 
1934, as amended, provides

[[Page 223]]

that the contracting party shall agree to make no subdivisions of any 
contract or subcontract for the same article or articles for the purpose 
of evading the provisions of the act. If any such subdivision or 
subcontract is made it shall constitute a violation of the agreement 
provided for in the act, and the cost of completing a contract or 
subcontract by a contracting party which violates such agreement shall 
be determined in a manner necessary clearly to reflect the true excess 
profit of such contracting party.

Sec. 16.13 Books of account and records. (a) It is recognized that no 
uniform method of accounting can be prescribed for all contracting 
parties subject to the provisions of the act. Each contracting party is 
required by law to make a report of its true profits and excess profit. 
Such party must, therefore, maintain such accounting records as will 
enable it to do so. See Sec. 16.8. Among the essentials are the 
following:
    (1) The profit or loss upon a particular contract or subcontract 
shall be accounted for and fully explained in the books of account 
separately on each contract or subcontract.
    (2) Any cost accounting methods, however standard they may be and 
regardless of long continued practice, shall be controlled by, and be in 
accord with, the objectives and purposes of the act and of any 
regulations prescribed thereunder.
    (3) The accounts shall clearly disclose the nature and amount of the 
different items of cost of performing a contract or subcontract.
    (b) In cases where it has been the custom priorly to use so-called 
``normal'' rates of overhead expense or administrative expenses, or 
``standard'' or ``normal'' prices of material or labor charges, no 
objection will be made to the use temporarily during the period of 
performing the contract or subcontract of such methods in charging the 
contract or subcontract, if the method of accounting employed is such as 
clearly to reflect, in the final determination upon the books of 
account, the actual profit derived from the performance of the contract 
or subcontract and if the necessary adjusting entries are entered upon 
the books and they explain in full detail the revisions necessary to 
accord with the facts. As to the elements of cost, see Sec. 16.8.
    (c) All books, records, and original evidences of costs (including, 
among other things, production orders, bills or schedules of materials, 
purchase requisitions, purchase orders, vouchers, requisitions for 
materials, standing expense orders, inventories, labor time cards, pay 
rolls, cost distribution sheets) pertinent to the determination of the 
true profit, excess profit, deficiency in profit or net loss from the 
performance of a contract or subcontract shall be kept at all times 
available for inspection by internal- revenue officers, and shall be 
carefully preserved and retained so long as the contents thereof may 
become material in the administration of the act. This provision is not 
confined to books, records, and original evidences pertaining to items 
which may be considered to be a part of the cost of performing a 
contract or subcontract. It is applicable to all books, records, and 
original evidences of costs of each plant, branch or department involved 
in the performance of a contract or subcontract or in the allocation or 
distribution of costs to the contract or subcontract.

Sec. 16.14 Report to Secretary of the Army. (a) Upon the completion of 
a contract or subcontract coming within the scope of the act and the 
regulations in this part, the contracting party is required to make a 
report, under oath, to the Secretary of the Army. As to the date of 
completion of a contract or subcontract, see Sec. 16.4. Such report 
shall be in the form prescribed by the Secretary of the Army and shall 
state the total contract price, the cost of performing the contract, the 
net income from such contract, and the per centum such income bears to 
the contract price. The contracting party shall also include as a part 
of such report a statement showing:
    (1) The manner in which the indirect costs were determined and 
allocated to the cost of performing the contract or subcontract (see 
Sec. 16.8);
    (2) The name and address of every subcontractor with whom a 
subcontract was made, the object of such subcontract, the date when 
completed and the amount thereof; and
    (3) The name and address of each affiliate or other organization, 
trade or business owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the same 
interests as those who so own or control the contracting party, together 
with a statement showing in detail all transactions which were made with 
such affiliate or other organization, trade or business and are 
pertinent to the determination of the excess profit.
    (b) A copy of the report required to be made to the Secretary of the 
Army is required to be transmitted by the contracting party to the 
Secretary of the Treasury. Such copy shall not be transmitted directly 
to the Secretary of the Treasury but shall be filed as a part of the 
annual report. See Sec. 16.15.

Sec. 16.15 Annual reports for income-taxable years--(a) General 
requirements. Every contracting party completing a contract or 
subcontract within the contracting party's income-taxable year ending 
after April 3, 1939 shall file with the district director of internal 
revenue for the internal revenue district in which the contracting 
party's Federal income tax returns are required to be filed an annual 
report on the prescribed form of the profit and excess profit on all 
contracts and subcontracts coming within the scope of the

[[Page 224]]

act and the regulations in this part and completed within the particular 
income-taxable year. There shall be included as a part of such a report 
a statement, preferably in columnar form, showing separately for each 
such contract or subcontract completed by the contracting party within 
the income-taxable year the total contract price, the cost of performing 
the contract or subcontract and the resulting profit or loss on each 
contract or subcontract together with a summary statement showing in 
detail the computation of the net profit or net loss upon all contracts 
and subcontracts completed within the income-taxable year and the amount 
of the excess profit, if any, for the income-taxable year covered by the 
report. A copy of the report made to the Secretary of the Army (see 
Sec. 16.14) with respect to each contract or subcontract covered in the 
annual report, shall be filed as a part of such annual report. In case 
the income-taxable year of the contracting party is a period of less 
than twelve months (see Sec. 16.1), the report required by this section 
shall be made for such period and not for a full year.
    (b) Time for filing annual reports. Annual reports of contracts and 
subcontracts coming within the scope of the act and the regulations in 
this part completed by a contracting party within an income-taxable year 
must be filed on or before the 15th day of the ninth month following the 
close of the contracting party's income-taxable year. It is important 
that the contracting party render on or before the due date an annual 
report as nearly complete and final as it is possible for the 
contracting party to prepare. An extension of time granted the 
contracting party for filing its Federal income tax return does not 
serve to extend the time for filing the annual report required by this 
section. Authority consistent with authorizations for granting 
extensions of time for filing Federal income tax returns is hereby 
delegated to the various collectors of internal revenue for granting 
extensions of time for filing the reports required by this section. 
Application for extensions of time for filing such reports should be 
addressed to the district director of internal revenue for the district 
in which the contracting party files its Federal income tax returns and 
must contain a full recital of the causes for the delay.

Sec. 16.16 Payment of excess profit liability. The amount of the excess 
profit liability to be paid to the United States shall be paid on or 
before the due date for filing the report with the district director of 
internal revenue. See Sec. 16.15. At the option of the contracting 
party, the amount of the excess profit liability may be paid in four 
equal installments instead of in a single payment, in which case the 
first installment is to be paid on or before the date prescribed for the 
payment of the excess profit as a single payment, the second installment 
on or before the 15th day of the third month, the third installment on 
or before the 15th day of the sixth month, and the fourth installment on 
or before the 15th day of the ninth month, after such date.

Sec. 16.17 Liability of surety. The surety under contracts entered into 
with the Secretary of the Army for the construction or manufacture of 
any complete aircraft or any portion thereof for the Army shall not be 
liable for payment of excess profit due the United States in respect of 
such contracts.

Sec. 16.18 Determination of liability for excess profit, interest and 
penalties; assessment, collection, payment, refunds. (a) The duty of 
determining the correct amount of excess profit liability on contracts 
and subcontracts coming within the scope of the act and the regulations 
in this part is upon the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. Under section 
3(b) of the act of March 27, 1934, as last amended, all provisions of 
law (including the provisions of law relating to interest, penalties and 
refunds) applicable with respect to the taxes imposed by Title I of the 
Revenue Act of 1934 and not inconsistent with section 3 of the act of 
March 27, 1934, as last amended, are applicable with respect to the 
assessment, collection, or payment of excess profits on contracts and 
subcontracts coming within the scope of the act and the regulations in 
this part and to refunds of overpayments of profits into the Treasury 
under the act. Claims by a contracting party for the refund of an amount 
of excess profit, interest, penalties, and additions to such excess 
profit shall conform to the general requirements prescribed with respect 
to claims for refund of overpayments of taxes imposed by Title I of the 
Revenue Act of 1934 and, if filed on account of any additional costs 
incurred pursuant to guarantee provisions in a contract, shall be 
supplemented by a statement under oath showing the amount and nature of 
such costs and all facts pertinent thereto.
    (b) Administrative procedure for the determination, assessment and 
collection of excess profit liability under the act and the regulations 
in this part and the examination of reports and claims in connection 
therewith will be prescribed from time to time by the Commissioner of 
Internal Revenue.

Sec. 17.1 Definitions. As used in the regulations in this part the 
term:
    (a) Act means the act of March 27, 1934 (48 Stat. 505; 34 U.S.C. 
496), as originally enacted, as amended by the act of June 25, 1936 (49 
Stat. 1926; 34 U.S.C. 496), and as further amended by the act of April 
3, 1939 (53 Stat. 560; 34 U.S.C. 496).
    (b) Person includes an individual, a corporation, a partnership, a 
trust or estate, a joint-stock company, an association, or a syndicate, 
group, pool, joint venture or other unincorporated organization or 
group, through or by means of which any business, financial operation or 
venture is carried on.
    (c) Contract means an agreement made by authority of the Secretary 
of the Navy for the construction or manufacture of any complete naval 
vessel or aircraft or any portion thereof.
    (d) Contractor means a person entering into a direct contract with 
the Secretary of the Navy or his duly authorized representative.
    (e) Subcontract means an agreement entered into by one person with 
another person for the construction or manufacture of a complete naval 
vessel or aircraft or any portion thereof, the prime contract for such 
vessel or aircraft or portion thereof having been entered into between a 
contractor and the Secretary of the Navy or his duly authorized 
representative.
    (f) Subcontractor means any person other than a contractor entering 
into a subcontract.
    (g) Contracting party means a contractor or subcontractor as the 
case may be.
    (h) Contract price or contract price means the amount or total 
amount to be received under a contract or subcontract as the case may 
be.
    (i) Income-taxable year means the calendar year, the fiscal year 
ending during such calendar year or the fractional part of such calendar 
or fiscal year, upon the basis of which the contracting party's net 
income is computed and for which its income tax returns are made for 
Federal income tax purposes.

Sec. 17.2 Scope of this part. The regulations in this part deal with 
liability for excess profit on contracts and subcontracts for the 
construction or manufacture of any complete naval vessel or aircraft or 
any portion thereof completed within income-taxable years ending after 
April 3, 1939. As to the date of the completion of a contract or 
subcontract, see Sec. 17.5.

Sec. 17.3 Contracts and subcontracts under which excess profit 
liability may be incurred. Except as otherwise provided with respect to 
contracts or subcontracts for certain scientific equipment (see Sec. 
17.4), every contract awarded for an amount exceeding $10,000 and 
entered into after the enactment of the act of March 27, 1934 for the 
construction or manufacture of any complete naval vessel or aircraft, or 
any portion thereof, is subject to the provisions of the act relating to 
excess profit liability. Any subcontract made with respect to such a 
contract and involving an amount in excess of $10,000 is also within the 
scope of the act. If a contracting party places orders with another 
party, aggregating an amount in excess of $10,000, for articles or 
materials which constitute a part of the cost of performing the contract 
or subcontract, the placing of such orders shall constitute a 
subcontract within the scope of the act, unless it is clearly shown that 
each of the orders involving $10,000 or less is a bona fide separate and 
distinct subcontract and not a subdivision made for the purpose of 
evading the provisions of the act.

Sec. 17.4 Contracts or subcontracts for scientific equipment. No excess 
profit liability is incurred upon a contract or subcontract entered into 
after the amendment of section 3(b) of the act of June 25, 1936, if at 
the time or prior to the time such contract or subcontract is made it is 
designated by the Secretary of the Navy as being exempt under the 
provisions of the act pertaining to scientific equipment used for 
communication, target detection, navigation, or fire control. The 
exemption of contracts or subcontracts for scientific equipment does not 
extend to any contract or subcontract entered into prior to the 
enactment of such amendment of section 3(b) of the act.

Sec. 17.5 Completion of contract defined. The date of delivery of the 
vessel, aircraft or portion thereof covered by the contract or 
subcontract shall be considered the date of completion of the contract 
or subcontract unless otherwise determined jointly by the Secretary of 
the Navy and the Secretary of the Treasury or their duly authorized 
representatives. Except as otherwise provided in the preceding sentence, 
the replacement of defective parts of delivered articles or the 
performance of other guarantee work in respect to such articles will not 
operate to extend the date of completion. As to the treatment of the 
cost of such work as a cost of performing a contract or subcontract, see 
Sec. 17.9(h). As to a refund in case of adjustment due to any 
subsequently incurred additional costs, see Sec. 17.19. If a contract 
or subcontract is at any time cancelled or terminated, it is completed 
at the time of the cancellation or termination.

Sec. 17.6 Manner of determining liability with respect to contracts or 
subcontracts for complete naval vessles or portions thereof. If in an 
income-taxable year ending after April 3, 1939 a contracting party 
completes one or more contracts or subcontracts coming within the scope 
of the act and entered into for the construction or manufacture of any 
complete naval vessel or any portion thereof, the amount of excess 
profit to be paid to the

[[Page 226]]

United States with respect to all such contracts and subcontracts 
completed within the income-taxable year shall be computed as follows:
    (a) The first step is to ascertain the total contract prices of all 
such contracts and subcontracts completed by the contracting party 
within the income-taxable year. As to total contract prices, see 
Sec. Sec. 17.1 and 17.8.
    (b) The second step is to ascertain the cost of performing such 
contracts and subcontracts (see Sec. 17.9) and to deduct such cost from 
the total contract prices of such contracts and subcontracts as computed 
in the first step.

The amount remaining after such subtraction is the amount of net profit 
or net loss upon such contracts and subcontracts completed within the 
income-taxable year.
    (c) The third step, in case there is a new profit upon such 
contracts and subcontracts, is to subtract from the amount of such net 
profit as computed in the second step the sum of:
    (1) An amount equal to 10 percent of the total contract prices of 
such contracts and subcontracts completed within the income- taxable 
year; and
    (2) The amount of any net loss which was sustained in the preceding 
income-taxable year with respect to contracts or subcontracts entered 
into for the construction or manufacture of any complete naval vessel or 
any portion thereof, and which is allowable as a credit in determining 
the excess profit for the income-taxable year with respect to contracts 
and subcontracts entered into for the construction or manufacture of any 
complete naval vessel or any portion thereof (see Sec. 17.10(a)).

The amount remaining after such subtraction is the amount of excess 
profit for the income-taxable year with respect to contracts and 
subcontracts entered into for the construction or manufacture of any 
complete naval vessel or any portion thereof.
    (d) The fourth step is to ascertain the amount of credit allowed for 
Federal income taxes paid or remaining to be paid upon the amount of 
such excess profit as computed in the third step (see Sec. 17.11) and 
then subtract from the amount of such excess profit the amount of credit 
for Federal income taxes. The amount remaining after this subtraction is 
the amount of excess profit to be paid to the United States by the 
contracting party for the income-taxable year with respect to contracts 
and subcontracts entered into for the construction or manufacture of any 
complete naval vessel or any portion thereof and completed within the 
income- taxable year.
    (e) The application of the provisions of this section of the 
regulations may be illustrated by the following example:
    Example: On September 1, 1939 the A Corporation, which keeps its 
books and makes its Federal income tax returns on a calendar year basis, 
entered into a contract with the Secretary of the Navy for the 
construction of portions of a naval vessel coming within the scope of 
the act, the total contract price of which $200,000. On March 10, 1940 
the A Corporation entered into another such contract, the total contract 
price of which was $40,000. Both contracts were completed within the 
calendar year 1940, the first at a cost of $155,000 and the second at a 
cost of $45,000. During the year 1940 the A Corporation also completed 
at a loss of $10,000 two contracts entered into for the construction or 
manufacture of naval aircraft coming within the scope of the act. For 
the year 1939 the A Corporation sustained a net loss of $2,500 on all 
contracts and subcontracts for any complete naval vessel or any portion 
thereof coming within the scope of the act and completed within the 
calendar year 1939. For the year 1939 the A Corporation also sustained a 
net loss of $1,800 on all other contracts and subcontracts coming within 
the scope of the act which were completed within the calendar year 1939. 
For purposes of Federal income tax, the net income of the A Corporation 
for the year 1940 amounted to $96,000, which amount included the net 
profit of $40,000 upon the contracts entered into on September 1, 1939 
and March 10, 1940. For the year 1940 the A Corporation paid Federal 
income taxes amounting to $19,200. The excess profit liability of the A 
Corporation for 1940 is payable with respect to the contracts for 
portions of a naval vessel which were completed in 1940. The loss of 
$10,000 on other contracts completed in 1940 and the net loss of $1,800 
for 1939 on contracts and subcontracts for naval aircraft do not enter 
into the computation of such liability. Accordingly, the excess profit 
liability of the A Corporation for 1940 is $10,800 computed as follows:

Total contract prices:
  Contract No. 1................................    $200,000
  Contract No. 2................................      40,000
                                                 ------------
                                                  ..........    $240,000
  Less cost of performing contracts:
  Contract No. 1................................     155,000
  Contract No. 2................................      45,000
                                                 ------------
                                                  ..........     200,000
                                                             -----------
    Net profit on contracts.................................      40,000
 
Less:
  10 percent of total contract prices (10             24,000
   percent of $240,000).........................
  Net loss from 1939............................       2,500
                                                 ------------
                                                  ..........      26,500
                                                             -----------
      Excess profit for year 1940...........................      13,500

  Less credit for Federal income taxes (Federal income tax         2,700
   on $13,500 at rates for 1940)............................

    Amount of excess profit payable to the United States....      10,800
 

Sec. 17.7 Manner of determining liability with respect to contracts or 
subcontracts for complete naval aircraft or portions thereof. If in an 
income-taxable year ending after April 3, 1939 a contracting party 
completes one or more contracts or subcontracts coming within the scope 
of the act and entered into for the construction or manufacture of any 
complete naval aircraft or any portion thereof, the amount of excess 
profit to be paid to the United States with respect to all such 
contracts and subcontracts completed within the income-taxable year 
shall be computed as follows:
    (a) The first step is to ascertain the total contract prices of all 
such contracts and subcontracts completed by the contracting party 
within the income-taxable year. As to total contract prices, see Sec. 
Sec. 17.1 and 17.8.
    (b) The second step is to ascertain the cost of performing such 
contracts and subcontracts (see Sec. 17.9) and to deduct such cost from 
the total contract prices of such contracts and subcontracts as computed 
in the first step.

The amount remaining after such subtraction is the amount of net profit 
or net loss upon such contracts and subcontracts completed within the 
income-taxable year.
    (c) The third step, in case there is a net profit upon such 
contracts and subcontracts, is to subtract from the amount of such net 
profit as computed in the second step the sum of:
    (1) An amount equal to 12 percent of the total contract prices of 
such contracts and subcontracts completed within the income- taxable 
year;
    (2) The amount of any net loss which was sustained in the same or a 
prior income- taxable year with respect to contracts or subcontracts for 
the construction or manufacture of any complete aircraft or any portion 
thereof, and which is allowable as a credit in determining the excess 
profit for the income-taxable year with respect to contracts and 
subcontracts entered into for the construction or manufacture of 
complete aircraft or any portion thereof (see Sec. 17.10(b)); and
    (3) The amount of any deficiency in profit which was sustained in 
the same or a prior income-taxable year with respect to contracts or 
subcontracts for the construction or manufacture of any complete 
aircraft or any portion thereof, and which is allowable as a credit in 
determining the excess profit for the income-taxable year with respect 
to contracts and subcontracts entered into for the construction or 
manufacture of complete aircraft or any portion thereof (see Sec. 
17.10(c)).

The amount remaining after such subtraction is the amount of excess 
profit for the income-taxable year with respect to contracts and 
subcontracts entered into for the construction or manufacture of 
complete naval aircraft or any portion thereof.
    (d) The fourth step is to ascertain the amount of credit allowed for 
Federal income taxes paid or remaining to be paid upon the amount of 
such excess profit as computed in the third step (see Sec. 17.11) and 
then subtract from the amount of such excess profit the amount of credit 
for Federal income taxes. The amount remaining after this subtraction is 
the amount of excess profit to be paid to the United States by the 
contracting party for the income-taxable year with respect to contracts 
and subcontracts entered into for the construction or manufacture of 
complete naval aircraft or any portion thereof and completed within the 
income-taxable year.
    (e) The application of the provisions of this section of the 
regulations may be illustrated by the following example:
    Example. On September 1, 1939, the B Corporation, which keeps its 
books and makes its Federal income tax returns on a calendar year basis, 
entered into a contract with the Secretary of the Navy for the 
construction of naval aircraft coming within the scope of the act, the 
total contract price of which was $200,000. On March 10, 1940, the B 
Corporation entered into another such contract, the total contract price 
of which was $40,000. Both contracts were completed within the calendar 
year 1940, the first at a cost of $155,000 and the second at a cost of 
$45,000. During the year 1940, the B Corporation also completed at a 
deficiency in profit of $2,000 a contract entered into for the 
construction of Army aircraft coming within the scope of the act. During 
the year 1940, the B Corporation also completed at a loss of $10,000 two 
contracts entered into for the construction or manufacture of portions 
of a naval vessel coming within the scope of the act. For the year 1939, 
the B Corporation sustained a net loss of $2,500 and a deficiency in 
profit of $1,000 on all contracts and subcontracts for naval aircraft 
coming within the scope of the act and completed within the calendar 
year 1939. For the year 1939, the B Corporation also sustained a net 
loss of $1,800 on a contract for the construction of Army aircraft 
coming within the scope of the act which was completed within the 
calendar year 1939. For the purposes of the Federal income tax, the net 
income of the B Corporation for the year 1940, on which the tax was 
paid, amounted to $96,000, which included the net profit of $40,000 upon 
the contracts entered into on September 1, 1939, and March 10, 1940. The 
excess profit liability of the B Corporation for 1940 is payable with 
respect to the

[[Page 228]]

contracts for naval aircraft which were completed in 1940. The loss of 
$10,000 on the contracts for portions of a naval vessel completed in 
1940 does not enter into the computation of such liability. Accordingly, 
the excess profit liability of the B Corporation for 1940 is $2,964 
computed as follows:

Total contract prices:
  Contract No. 1................................    $200,000
  Contract No. 2................................      40,000
                                                 ------------

12443, Dec. 6, 1960]

Sec. 17.8 Total contract price. The total contract price of a 
particular contract or subcontract (see Sec. 17.1) may be received in 
money or its equivalent. If something other than money is received, only 
the fair market value of the thing received, at the date of receipt, is 
to be included in determining the amount received. Bonuses earned for 
bettering performance and penalties incurred for failure to meet the 
contract guarantees are to be regarded as adjustments of the original 
contract price. Trade or other discounts granted by a contracting party 
in respect of a contract or subcontract performed by such party are also 
to be deducted in determining the true total contract price of such 
contract or subcontract.

Sec. 17.9 Cost of performing a contract or subcontract--(a) General 
rule. The cost of performing a particular contract or subcontract shall 
be the sum of (1) the direct costs, including therein expenditures for 
materials, direct labor and direct expenses, incurred by the contracting 
party in performing the contract or subcontract; and (2) the proper 
proportion of any indirect costs (including therein a reasonable 
proportion of management expenses) incident to and necessary for the 
performance of the contract or subcontract.
    (b) Elements of cost. No definitions of the elements of cost may be 
stated which are of invariable application to all contractors and 
subcontractors. In general, the elements of cost may be defined for 
purposes of the act as follows:
    (1) Manufacturing cost, which is the sum of factory cost (see 
paragraph (c) of this section) and other manufacturing cost (see 
paragraph (d) of this section);
    (2) Miscellaneous direct expenses (see paragraph (e) of this 
section);
    (3) General expenses, which are the sum of indirect engineering 
expenses, usually termed ``engineering overhead'' (see paragraph (f) of 
this section) and expenses of distribution, servicing and administration 
(see paragraph (g) of this section); and
    (4) Guarantee expenses (see paragraph (h) of this section).
    (c) Factory cost. Factory cost is the sum of the following:
    (1) Direct materials. Materials, such as those purchased for stock 
and subsequently issued for contract operations and those acquired under 
subcontracts, which become a component part of the finished product or 
which are used directly in fabricating, converting or processing such 
materials or parts.
    (2) Direct productive labor. Productive labor, usually termed ``shop 
labor,'' which is performed on and is properly chargeable directly to 
the article manufactured or constructed pursuant to the contract or 
subcontract, but which ordinarily does not include direct engineering 
labor (see subparagraph (3) of this paragraph).
    (3) Direct engineering labor. The compensation of professional 
engineers and other technicists (including reasonable advisory fees), 
and of draftsmen, properly chargeable directly to the cost of the 
contract or subcontract.
    (4) Miscellaneous direct factory charges. Items which are properly 
chargeable directly to the factory cost of performing the contract or 
subcontract but which do not come within the classifications in 
subparagraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this paragraph, as for example, 
royalties which the contracting party pays to another party and which 
are properly chargeable to the cost of performing the contract or 
subcontract (but see paragraph (d) of this section).
    (5) Indirect factory expenses. Items, usually termed ``factory 
overhead,'' which are not directly chargeable to the factory cost of 
performing the contract or subcontract but

[[Page 229]]

which are properly incident to and necessary for the performance of the 
contract or subcontract and consist of the following:
    (i) Labor. Amounts expended for factory labor, such as supervision 
and inspection, clerical labor, timekeeping, packing and shipping, 
stores supply, services of tool crib attendants, and services in the 
factory employment bureau, which are not chargeable directly to 
productive labor of the contract or subcontract.
    (ii) Materials and supplies. The cost of materials and supplies for 
general use in the factory in current operations, such as shop fuel, 
lubricants, heat-treating, plating, cleaning and anodizing supplies, 
nondurable tools and gauges, stationery (such as time tickets and other 
forms), and boxing and wrapping materials.
    (iii) Service expenses. Factory expenses of a general nature, such 
as those for power, heat and light (whether purchased or produced), 
ventilation and air conditioning and operation and maintenance of 
general plant assets and facilities.
    (iv) Fixed charges and obsolescence. Recurring charges with respect 
to property used for manufacturing purposes of the contract or 
subcontract, such as premiums for fire and elevator insurance, property 
taxes, rentals and allowances for depreciation of such property, 
including maintenance and depreciation of reasonable standby equipment; 
and depreciation and obsolescence of special equipment and facilities 
necessarily acquired primarily for the performance of the contract or 
subcontract. In making allowances for depreciation, consideration shall 
be given to the number and length of shifts.
    (v) Miscellaneous indirect factory expenses. Miscellaneous factory 
expenses not directly chargeable to the factory cost of performing the 
contract or subcontract, such as purchasing expenses; ordinary and 
necessary expenses of rearranging facilities within a department or 
plant; employees' welfare expenses; premiums or dues on compensation 
insurance; employers' payments to unemployment, old age and social 
security, Federal and State funds not including payments deducted from 
or chargeable to employees or officers; pensions and retirement payments 
to factory employees; factory accident compensation (as to self-
insurance, see paragraph (g) of this section); but not including any 
amounts which are not incident to services, operations, plant, equipment 
or facilities involved in the performance of the contract or 
subcontract.
    (d) Other manufacturing cost. Other manufacturing cost as used in 
paragraph (b) of this section includes items of manufacturing costs 
which are not properly or satisfactorily chargeable to factory costs 
(see paragraph (c) of this section) but which upon a complete showing of 
all pertinent facts are properly to be included as a cost of performing 
the contract or subcontract, as for instance, payments of royalties and 
amortization of the cost of designs purchased and patent rights over 
their useful life; and ``deferred'' or ``unliquidated'' experimental and 
development charges. For example, in case experimental and development 
costs have been properly deferred or capitalized and are amortized in 
accordance with a reasonably consistent plan, a proper portion of the 
current charge, determined by a ratable allocation which is reasonable 
in consideration of the pertinent facts, may be treated as a cost of 
performing the contract or subcontract. In the case of general 
experimental and development expenses which may be charged off 
currently, a reasonable portion thereof may be allocated to the cost of 
performing the contract or subcontract. If a special experimental or 
development project is carried on in pursuance of a contract, or in 
anticipation of a contract which is later entered into, and the expense 
is not treated as a part of general experimental and development 
expenses or is not otherwise allowed as a cost of performing the 
contract, there clearly appearing no reasonable prospect of an 
additional contract for the type of article involved, the entire cost of 
such project may be allowed as a part of the cost of performing the 
contract.
    (e) Miscellaneous direct expenses. Miscellaneous direct expenses as 
used in paragraph (b) of this section include:
    (1) Cost of installation and construction. Cost of installation and 
construction includes the cost of materials, labor and expenses 
necessary for the erection and installation prior to the completion of 
the contract and after the delivery of the product or material 
manufactured or constructed pursuant to the contract or subcontract.
    (2) Sundry direct expenses. Items of expense which are properly 
chargeable directly to the cost of performing a contract or subcontract 
and which do not constitute guarantee expenses (see paragraph (h) of 
this section) or direct costs classified as factory cost or other 
manufacturing cost (see paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section), such as 
premiums on performance or other bonds required under the contract or 
subcontract; State sales taxes imposed on the contracting party; freight 
on outgoing shipments; fees paid for wind tunnel and model basin tests; 
demonstration and test expenses; crash insurance premiums; traveling 
expenses. In order for any such item to be allowed as a charge directly 
to the cost of performing a contract or subcontract, (i) a detailed 
record shall be kept by the contracting party of all items of a similar 
character, and (ii) no item of a similar character which is properly a 
direct charge to other work shall be allowed as a part of any indirect 
expenses in determining the proper proportion thereof chargeable to the 
cost of performing the contract or subcontract. As to allowable indirect 
expenses,

[[Page 230]]

see paragraphs (c)(5), (f), (g), and (j) of this section.
    (f) Indirect engineering expenses. Indirect engineering expenses, 
usually termed ``engineering overhead,'' which are treated in this 
section as a part of general expenses in determining the cost of 
performing a contract or subcontract (see paragraph (b) of this 
section), comprise the general engineering expenses which are incident 
to and necessary for the performance of the contract or subcontract, 
such as the following:
    (1) Labor. Reasonable fees of engineers employed in a general 
consulting capacity, and compensation of employees for personal services 
to the engineering department, such as supervision, which is properly 
chargeable to the contract or subcontract, but which is not chargeable 
as direct engineering labor (see paragraph (c)(3) of this section).
    (2) Material. Supplies for the engineering department, such as paper 
and ink for drafting and similar supplies.
    (3) Miscellaneous expenses. Expenses of the engineering department, 
such as (i) maintenance and repair of engineering equipment, and (ii) 
services purchased outside of the engineering department for blue- 
printing, drawing, computing, and like purposes.
    (g) Expenses of distribution, servicing and administration. Expenses 
of distribution, servicing and administration, which are treated in this 
section as a part of general expenses in determining the cost of 
performing a contract or subcontract (see paragraph (b) of this 
section), comprehend the expenses incident to and necessary for the 
performance of the contract or subcontract, which are incurred in 
connection with the distribution and general servicing of the 
contracting party's products and the general administration of the 
business, such as:
    (1) Compensation for personal services of employees. The salaries of 
the corporate and general executive officers and the salaries and wages 
of administrative clerical employees and of the office services 
employees such as telephone operators, janitors, cleaners, watchmen and 
office equipment repairmen.
    (2) Bidding and general selling expenses. Bidding and general 
selling expenses which by reference to all the pertinent facts and 
circumstances reasonably constitute a part of the cost of performing a 
contract or subcontract. The treatment of bidding and general selling 
expenses as a part of general expenses in accordance with this paragraph 
is in lieu of any direct charges which otherwise might be made for such 
expenses. The term ``bidding expenses'' as used in this section includes 
all expenses in connection with preparing and submitting bids.
    (3) General servicing expenses. Expenses which by reference to all 
the pertinent facts and circumstances reasonably constitute a part of 
the cost of performing a contract or subcontract and which are incident 
to delivered or installed articles and are due to ordinary adjustments 
or minor defects; but including no items which are treated as a part of 
guarantee expenses (see paragraph (h) of this section) or as a part of 
direct costs, such as direct materials, direct labor, and other direct 
expense.
    (4) Other expenses. Miscellaneous office and administrative 
expenses, such as stationery and office supplies; postage; repair and 
depreciation of office equipment; contributions to local charitable or 
community organizations to the extent constituting ordinary and 
necessary business expenses; employees' welfare expenses; premiums and 
dues on compensation insurance; employers' payments to unemployment, old 
age and social security Federal and State funds not including payments 
deducted from or chargeable to employees or officers; pensions and 
retirement payments to administrative office employees and accident 
compensation to office employees (as to self-insurance, see subdivision 
(i) of this subparagraph).
    (i) Subject to the exception stated in this subdivision, in cases 
where a contracting party assumes its own insurable risks (usually 
termed ``self-insurance''), losses and payments will be allowed in the 
cost of performing a contract or subcontract only to the extent of the 
actual losses suffered or payments incurred during, and in the course 
of, the performance of the contract or subcontract and properly 
chargeable to such contract or subcontract. If, however, a contracting 
party assumes its own insurable risks (a) for compensation paid to 
employees for injuries received in the performance of their duties, or 
(b) for unemployment risks in States where insurance is required, there 
may be allowed as a part of the cost of performing a contract or 
subcontract a reasonable portion of the charges set up for purposes of 
self-insurance under a system of accounting regularly employed by the 
contracting party, as determined by the Commissioner of Internal 
Revenue, at rates not exceeding the lawful or approved rates of 
insurance companies for such insurance, reduced by amounts representing 
the acquisition cost in such companies, provided the contracting party 
adopts and consistently follows this method with respect to self-
insurance in connection with all contracts and subcontracts subsequently 
performed by him.
    (ii) Allowances for interest on invested capital are not allowable 
as costs of performing a contract or subcontract.
    (iii) Among the items which shall not be included as a part of the 
cost of performing a contract or subcontract or considered in 
determining such cost, are the following: Entertainment expenses; dues 
and memberships other than of regular trade associations; donations 
except as otherwise provided above; losses on other contracts; profits 
or losses

[[Page 231]]

from sales or exchanges of capital assets; extraordinary expenses due to 
strikes or lockouts; fines and penalties; amortization of unrealized 
appreciation of values of assets; expenses, maintenance and depreciation 
of excess facilities (including idle land and building, idle parts of a 
building, and excess machinery and equipment) vacated or abandoned, or 
not adaptable for future use in performing contracts or subcontracts; 
increases in reserve accounts for contingencies, repairs, compensation 
insurance (except as above provided with respect to self-insurance) and 
guarantee work; Federal and State income and excess-profits taxes and 
surtaxes; cash discount earned up to one percent of the amount of the 
purchase, except that all discounts on subcontracts subject to the act 
will be considered; interest incurred or earned; bond discount or 
finance charges; premiums for life insurance on the lives of officers; 
legal and accounting fees in connection with reorganizations, security 
issues, capital stock issues and the prosecution of claims against the 
United States (including income tax matters); taxes and expenses on 
issues and transfers of capital stock; losses on investments; bad debts; 
and expenses of collection and exchange.
    (iv) In order that the cost of performing a contract or subcontract 
may be accounted for clearly, the amount of any excess profits repayable 
to the United States pursuant to the act should not be charged to or 
included in such cost.
    (h) Guarantee expenses. Guarantee expenses include the various items 
of factory, cost, other manufacturing cost, cost of installation and 
construction, indirect engineering expenses and other general expenses 
(see paragraphs (c) to (g) of this section) which are incurred after 
delivery or installation of the article manufactured or constructed 
pursuant to the particular contract or subcontract and which are 
incident to the correction of defects or deficiencies which the 
contracting party is required to make under the guarantee provisions of 
the particular contract or subcontract. If the total amount of such 
guarantee expenses is not ascertainable at the time of filing the report 
required to be filed with the district director of internal revenue (see 
Sec. 17.16) and the contracting party includes any estimated amount of 
such expenses as part of the claimed total cost of performing the 
contract or subcontract, such estimated amount shall be separately shown 
on the report and the reasons for claiming such estimated amount shall 
accompany the report; but only the amount of guarantee expenses actually 
incurred will be allowed. If the amount of guarantee expenses actually 
incurred is greater than the amount (if any) claimed on the report and 
the contracting party has made an overpayment of excess profit, a refund 
of the overpayment shall be made, in accordance with the provisions of 
Sec. 17.19. If the amount of guarantee expenses actually incurred is 
less than the amount claimed on the report and an additional amount of 
excess profit is determined to be due, the additional amount of excess 
profit shall be assessed and paid in accordance with the provisions of 
Sec. 17.19.
    (i) Unreasonable compensation. (1) The salaries and compensation for 
services which are treated as a part of the cost of performing a 
contract or subcontract include reasonable payments for salaries, 
bonuses, or other compensation for services. As a general rule, bonuses 
paid to employees (and not to officers) in pursuance of a regularly 
established incentive bonus system may be allowed as a part of the cost 
of performing a contract or subcontract.
    (2) The test of allowability is whether the aggregate compensation 
paid to each individual is for services actually rendered incident to, 
and necessary for, the performance of the contract or subcontract, and 
is reasonable. Excessive or unreasonable payments whether in cash, stock 
or other property ostensibly as compensation for services shall not be 
included in the cost of performing a contract or subcontract.
    (j) Allocation of indirect costs. No general rule applicable to all 
cases may be stated for ascertaining the proper proportion of the 
indirect costs to be allocated to the cost of performing a particular 
contract or subcontract. Such proper proportion depends upon all the 
facts and circumstances relating to the performance of the particular 
contract or subcontract. Subject to a requirement that all items which 
have no relation to the performance of the contract or subcontract shall 
be eliminated from the amount to be allocated, the following methods of 
allocation are outlined as acceptable in a majority of cases:
    (1) Factory indirect expenses. The allowable indirect factory 
expenses (see paragraph (c)(5) of this section) shall ordinarily be 
allocated or ``distributed'' to the cost of the contract or subcontract 
on the basis of the proportion which the direct productive labor (see 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section) attributable to the contract or 
subcontract bears to the total direct productive labor of the production 
department or particular section thereof during the period within which 
the contract or subcontract is performed, except that if the indirect 
factory expenses are incurred in different amounts and in different 
proportions by the various producing departments consideration shall be 
given to such circumstances to the extent necessary to make a fair and 
reasonable determination of the true profit and excess profit.
    (2) Engineering indirect expenses. The allowable indirect 
engineering expenses (see paragraph (f) of this section) shall 
ordinarily be allocated or ``distributed'' to the cost of the contract 
or subcontract on the basis of the

[[Page 232]]

proportion which the direct engineering labor attributable to the 
contract or subcontract (see paragraph (c)(3) of this section) bears to 
the total direct engineering labor of the engineering department or 
particular section thereof during the period within which the contract 
or subcontract is performed. If the expenses of the engineering 
department are not sufficient in amount to require the maintenance of 
separate accounts, the engineering indirect costs may be included in the 
indirect factory expenses (see paragraph (c)(5) of this section) and 
allocated or distributed to the cost of performing the contract or 
subcontract as a part of such expenses, provided the proportion so 
allocated or distributed is proper under the facts and circumstances 
relating to the performance of the particular contract or subcontract.
    (3) Administrative expenses (or ``overhead''). The allowable 
expenses of administration (see paragraph (g) of this section) or other 
general expenses except indirect engineering expenses, bidding and 
general selling expenses, and general servicing expenses shall 
ordinarily be allocated or distributed to the cost of performing a 
contract or subcontract on the basis of the proportion which the sum of 
the manufacturing cost (see paragraph (b) of this section) and the cost 
of installation and construction (see paragraph (e) of this section) 
attributable to the particular contract or subcontract bears to the sum 
of the total manufacturing cost and the total cost of installation and 
construction during the period within which the contract or subcontract 
is performed.
    (4) Bidding, general selling, and general servicing expenses. The 
allowable bidding and general selling expenses and general servicing 
expenses (see paragraph (g) (2) and (3) of this section) shall 
ordinarily be allocated or distributed to the cost of performing a 
contract or subcontract on the basis of:
    (i) The proportion which the contract price of the particular 
contract or subcontract bears to the total sales made (including 
contracts or subcontracts completed) during the period within which the 
particular contract or subcontract is performed, or
    (ii) The proportion which the sum of the manufacturing cost (see 
paragraph (b) of this section) and the cost of installation and 
construction (see paragraph (e) of this section) attributable to the 
particular contract or subcontract bears to the sum of the total 
manufacturing cost and the total cost of installation and construction 
during the period within which the contract or subcontract is performed.

except that special consideration shall be given to the relation which 
certain classes of such expenses bear to the various classes of article 
produced by the contracting party in each case in which such 
consideration is necessary in order to make a fair and reasonable 
determination of the true profit and excess profit. See Sec. 17.14.

Sec. 17.10 Credits for net loss and deficiency in profit in computing 
excess profit--(a) Net loss on contracts and subcontracts for naval 
vessels or portions thereof. In the case of contracts or subcontracts 
for the construction or manufacture of any complete naval vessel or any 
portion thereof coming within the scope of the act which are completed 
within an income-taxable year ending after April 3, 1939, the term ``net 
loss'' as used in the act and in this part means the amount by which the 
total costs of performing all such contracts and subcontracts completed 
within such income-taxable year exceeds the total contract prices of 
such contracts and subcontracts. Such net loss sustained by a 
contracting party for an income-taxable year ending after April 3, 1939, 
is allowable as a credit in computing the contracting party's excess 
profit on contracts and subcontracts for the construction or manufacture 
of any complete naval vessel or any portion thereof which are completed 
within the next succeeding income-taxable year.
    (b) Net loss on contracts and subcontracts for aircraft or portions 
thereof. In the case of contracts or subcontracts for the construction 
or manufacture of any complete aircraft or any portion thereof coming 
within the scope of the act, which are completed within an income-
taxable year ending after April 3, 1939, the term ``net loss'' as used 
in the act and in these regulations means the amount by which the total 
costs of performing all such contracts and subcontracts completed within 
such income-taxable year exceeds the total contract prices of such 
contracts and subcontracts. Such net loss sustained by a contracting 
party for an income-taxable year ending after April 3, 1939, is 
allowable as a credit in computing the contracting party's excess profit 
on contracts and subcontracts for the construction or manufacture of any 
complete aircraft or any portion thereof which are completed within the 
four next succeeding income-taxable years.
    (c) Deficiency in profit. The term ``deficiency in profit'' as used 
in the act and in this part relates to contracts and subcontracts coming 
within the scope of the act which are for the construction or 
manufacture of any complete aircraft or any portion thereof and are 
completed within an income-taxable year ending after April 3, 1939. As 
so used, the term ``deficiency in profit'' means the amount by which 12 
percent of the total contract prices of such contracts and subcontracts 
which are completed by a particular contracting party within the income-
taxable year exceeds the net profit upon such contracts and 
subcontracts. A deficiency in profit sustained by a contracting party 
with respect to such contracts and subcontracts

[[Page 233]]

for the construction or manufacture of complete aircraft or any portion 
thereof and completed within any income-taxable year ending after April 
3, 1939, is allowable as a credit in computing the contracting party's 
excess profit on contracts and subcontracts for the construction or 
manufacture of complete aircraft or any portion thereof which are 
completed within the same or the four next succeeding income-taxable 
years.
    (d) Claim for credit. Credit for a deficiency in profit or a net 
loss may be claimed in the contracting party's annual report of profit 
filed with the district director of internal revenue (see Sec. 17.16), 
but it shall be supported by separate schedules for each contract or 
subcontract involved showing total contract prices, costs of performance 
and pertinent facts relative thereto, together with a summarized 
computation of the deficiency in profit or net loss. The deficiency in 
profit or net loss claimed is subject to verification and adjustment. As 
to preservation of books and records, see Sec. 17.14. A deficiency in 
profit or net loss sustained on contracts and subcontracts completed 
within one income-taxable year may not be considered in computing a net 
loss or deficiency in profit sustained on contracts and subcontracts 
completed within another income- taxable year.
    (e) Examples. The provisions of this section of the regulations may 
be illustrated by the following examples:
    Example (1) For the calendar year 1939 the A Corporation, which 
keeps its books and makes its Federal income tax returns on a calendar 
year basis, sustained a net loss of $50,000 upon all contracts and 
subcontracts coming within the scope of the act which were entered into 
for the construction or manufacture of any complete naval vessel or any 
portion thereof and were completed within the calendar year 1939. For 
the calendar year 1940 the A Corporation had a net profit of $30,000 
upon all such contracts and subcontracts completed within the year 1940. 
It also had a net profit of $10,000 upon other contracts completed 
within that year all such contracts being for naval aircraft coming 
within the scope of the act. For the calendar year 1941 the corporation 
had a net profit of $25,000 upon contracts completed within that year. 
The net loss of $50,000 sustained in 1939 may be taken as a credit 
against the net profit of $30,000 realized in 1940 upon the contracts 
for the construction or manufacture of complete naval vessels or 
portions thereof completed within that year; but the excess of $20,000 
($50,000 minus $30,000) may not be taken as a credit in computing the 
excess profit realized upon the other contracts completed in 1940 at a 
net profit of $10,000 or as a credit in computing the excess profit upon 
the contracts completed within the year 1941 at a net profit of $25,000.
    Example (2). For the calendar year 1939, the B Corporation, which 
keeps its books and makes its Federal income tax returns on a calendar 
year basis, sustained a net loss of $10,000 and a deficiency in profit 
of $35,000 upon all contracts and subcontracts for naval aircraft and 
portions thereof coming within the scope of the act and completed within 
that year. During the year 1939, the B Corporation also completed 
contracts for Army aircraft coming within the scope of the Act at a net 
profit which was $15,000 in excess of 12 percent of the total contract 
prices of such contracts. On all contracts and subcontracts for naval 
aircraft coming within the scope of the act and completed within the 
calendar year 1940, the B Corporation realized a net profit which was 
$25,000 in excess of 12 percent of the total contract prices of such 
contracts and subcontracts while sustaining a deficiency in profit of 
$10,000 on like contracts and subcontracts for Army aircraft. On all 
contracts and subcontracts for naval aircraft coming within the scope of 
the act and completed within the calendar year 1941, the B Corporation 
realized a net profit which was $20,000 in excess of 12 percent of the 
total contract prices of such contracts. The net loss of $10,000 and 
deficiency in profit of $35,000 (or a total of $45,000) sustained in 
1939 with respect to contracts and subcontracts for naval aircraft 
completed within that year may be taken as a credit to the extent of 
$15,000 in computing the excess profit on the contracts and subcontracts 
for Army aircraft completed in 1939. The remainder of such net loss and 
such deficiency in profit ($45,000 minus $15,000, or $30,000) may be 
combined with the deficiency in profit of $10,000 sustained in 1940 on 
contracts for Army aircraft and taken as a credit to the extent of 
$25,000 in computing the excess profit on the contracts and subcontracts 
for aircraft completed during 1940. The sum of such net loss and such 
deficiency in profit then remaining ($40,000 minus $25,000, or $15,000) 
may be taken as a credit in computing the excess profit realized on the 
contracts and subcontracts for aircraft completed in the year 1941.
[T.D. 4906, 4 FR 2492, June 27, 1939, as amended by T.D. 6512, 25 FR 
12444, Dec. 6, 1960]

Sec. 17.11 Credit for Federal income taxes. For the purpose of 
computing the amount of excess profit to be paid to the United States, a 
credit is allowable against the excess profit for the amount of Federal 
income taxes paid or remaining to be paid on the amount of such excess 
profit. The ``Federal income taxes'' in respect of which this credit is 
allowable include the income taxes imposed by Titles I and IA of the 
Revenue Act of 1938, and Chapter 1 and Subchapter A of Chapter 2 of the

[[Page 234]]

Internal Revenue Code, and the excess-profits taxes imposed by section 
602 of the Revenue Act of 1938, and Subchapter B of Chapter 2 of the 
Internal Revenue Code. This credit is allowable for these taxes only to 
the extent that it is affirmatively shown that they have been finally 
determined and paid or remain to be paid and that they were imposed upon 
the excess profit against which the credit is to be made. In case such a 
credit has been allowed and the amount of Federal income taxes imposed 
upon the excess profit is redetermined, the credit previously allowed 
shall be accordingly adjusted.

Sec. 17.12 Failure of contractor to require agreement by subcontractor. 
(a) Every contract or subcontract coming within the scope of the act is 
required by the act to contain, among other things, an agreement by the 
contracting party to make no subcontract unless the subcontractor 
agrees:
    (1) To make a report, as described in the act, under oath to the 
Secretary of the Navy upon the completion of the subcontract;
    (2) To pay into the Treasury excess profit, as determined by the 
Treasury Department, in the manner and amounts specified in the act;
    (3) To make no subdivision of the subcontract for the same article 
or articles for the purpose of evading the provisions of the act;
    (4) That the manufacturing spaces and books of its own plant, 
affiliates, and subdivisions shall at all times be subject to inspection 
and audit as provided in the act.
    (b) If a contracting party enters into a subcontract with a 
subcontractor who fails to make such agreement, such contracting party 
shall, in addition to its liability for excess profit determined on 
contracts or subcontracts performed by it, be liable for any excess 
profit determined to be due the United States on the subcontract entered 
into with such subcontractor. In such event, however, the excess profit 
to be paid to the United States in respect of the subcontract entered 
into with such subcontractor shall be determined separately from any 
contracts or subcontracts performed by the contracting party entering 
into the subcontract with such subcontractor.

Sec. 17.13 Evasion of excess profit. Section 3 of the act provides that 
the contracting party shall agree to make no subdivisions of any 
contract or subcontract for the same article or articles for the purpose 
of evading the provisions of the act. If any such subdivision or 
subcontract is made it shall constitute a violation of the agreement 
provided for in the act, and the cost of completing a contract or 
subcontract by a contracting party which violates such agreement shall 
be determined in a manner necessary clearly to reflect the true excess 
profit of such contracting party.

Sec. 17.14 Books of account and records. (a) It is recognized that no 
uniform method of accounting can be prescribed for all contracting 
parties subject to the provisions of the act. Each contracting party is 
required by law to make a report of its true profit and excess profit. 
Such party must, therefore, maintain such accounting records as will 
enable it to do so. See Sec. 17.9. Among the essentials are the 
following:
    (1) The profit or loss upon a particular contract or subcontract 
shall be accounted for and fully explained in the books of account 
separately on each contract or subcontract.
    (2) Any cost accounting methods, however standard they may be and 
regardless of long continued practice, shall be controlled by, and be in 
accord with, the objectives and purposes of the act and of any 
regulations prescribed thereunder.
    (3) The accounts shall clearly disclose the nature and amount of the 
different items of cost of performing a contract or subcontract.
    (b) In cases where it has been the custom priorly to use so-called 
``normal'' rates of overhead expense or administrative expenses, or 
``standard'' or ``normal'' prices of material or labor charges, no 
objection will be made to the use temporarily during the period of 
performing the contract or subcontract of such methods in charging the 
contract or subcontract, if the method of accounting employed is such as 
clearly to reflect, in the final determination upon the books of 
account, the actual profit derived from the performance of the contract 
or subcontract and if the necessary adjusting entries are entered upon 
the books and they explain in full detail the revisions necessary to 
accord with the facts. As to the elements of cost, see Sec. 17.9.
    (c) All books, records, and original evidences of costs (including, 
for example, production orders, bills or schedules of materials, 
purchase requisitions, purchase orders, vouchers, requisitions for 
materials, standing expense orders, inventories, labor time cards, 
payrolls, cost distribution sheets) pertinent to the determination of 
the true profit, excess profit, deficiency in profit, or net loss from 
the performance of a contract or subcontract shall be kept at all times 
available for inspection by internal revenue officers, and shall be 
carefully preserved and retained so long as the contents thereof may 
become material in the administration of the act. This provision is not 
confined to books, records and original evidences pertaining to items 
which may be considered to be a part of the cost of performing a 
contract or subcontract. It is applicable to all books, records and 
original evidences of costs of each plant, branch or department involved 
in the performance of a contract or subcontract or in the distribution 
of costs to the contract or subcontract.


[[Page 235]]


Sec. 17.15 Report to Secretary of the Navy. (a) Upon the completion of 
a contract or a subcontract coming within the scope of the act and this 
part, the contracting party is required to make a report, under oath, to 
the Secretary of the Navy. As to the date of completion of a contract or 
subcontract, see Sec. 17.5. The act requires that such report shall be 
in the form prescribed by the Secretary of the Navy and shall state the 
total contract price, the cost of performing the contract, the net 
income from such contract, and the per centum such income bears to the 
contract price. The contracting party shall also include as a part of 
such report a statement showing:
    (1) The manner in which the indirect costs were determined and 
allocated to the cost of performing the contract or subcontract (see 
Sec. 17.9);
    (2) The name and address of every subcontractor with whom a 
subcontract was made, the object of such subcontract, the date when 
completed and the amount thereof; and
    (3) The name and address of each affiliate or other organization, 
trade or business owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the same 
interests as those who so own or control the contracting party, together 
with a statement showing in detail all transactions which were made with 
such affiliate or other organization, trade or business and are 
pertinent to the determination of the excess profit.
    (b) A copy of the report required to be made to the Secretary of the 
Navy is required to be transmitted by the contracting party to the 
Secretary of the Treasury. Such copy shall not be transmitted directly 
to the Secretary of the Treasury but shall be filed as a part of the 
annual report. See Sec. 17.16.

Sec. 17.16 Annual reports for income-taxable years--(a) General 
requirements. Every contracting party completing a contract or 
subcontract within the contracting party's income-taxable year ending 
after April 3, 1939 shall file, with the district director of internal 
revenue for the internal revenue district in which the contracting 
party's Federal income tax return is required to be filed, annual 
reports on the prescribed forms of the profit and excess profit on all 
contracts and subcontracts coming within the scope of the act. If any 
contracts or subcontracts so completed by the contracting party were 
entered into for the construction or manufacture of any complete naval 
vessel or any portion thereof, the profit and excess profit on all such 
contracts and subcontracts completed within the income-taxable year 
ending after April 3, 1939 shall be computed in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 17.6. If any contracts or subcontracts so completed 
by the contracting party were entered into for the construction or 
manufacture of any complete naval aircraft or any portion thereof, the 
profit and excess profit on all such contracts and subcontracts 
completed within the income-taxable year ending after April 3, 1939 
shall be computed in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 17.7. There 
shall be included as a part of the annual report a statement, preferably 
in columnar form, showing separately for each contract or subcontract 
completed by the contracting party within the income-taxable year and 
covered by the report, the total contract price, the cost of performing 
the contract or subcontract and resulting profit or loss on each 
contract or subcontract together with a summary statement showing in 
detail the computation of the net profit or net loss upon each group of 
contracts and subcontracts covered by the report and the amount of the 
excess profit, if any, with respect to each group of contracts and 
subcontracts covered by the report. A copy of the report made to the 
Secretary of the Navy (see Sec. 17.15) with respect to each contract or 
subcontract covered in the annual report, shall be filed as a part of 
such annual report. In case the income-taxable year of the contracting 
party is a period of less than twelve months (see Sec. 17.1), the 
reports required by this section shall be made for such period and not 
for a full year.

    (b) Time for filing annual reports. Annual reports of contracts and 
subcontracts completed by a contracting party within an income-taxable 
year ending after April 3, 1939 shall be filed on or before the 15th day 
of the ninth month following the close of the contracting party's 
income-taxable year. It is important that the contracting party render 
on or before the due date annual reports as nearly complete and final as 
it is possible for the contracting party to prepare. An extension of 
time granted the contracting party for filing its Federal income tax 
return does not serve to extend the time for filing the annual reports 
required by this section. Authority consistent with authorizations for 
granting extensions of time for filing Federal income tax returns is 
hereby delegated to the various district directors of internal revenue 
for granting extensions of time for filing the reports required by this 
section. Application for extensions of time for filing such reports 
should be addressed to the district director of internal revenue for the 
district in which the contracting party files its Federal income tax 
returns and must contain a full recital of the causes for the delay.

Sec. 17.17 Payment of excess profit liability. The amount of the excess 
profit liability to be paid to the United States shall be paid on or 
before the due date for filing the report with the district director of 
internal revenue. See Sec. 17.16. At the option of the contracting 
party, the amount of the excess profit liability may be paid in four 
equal installments instead of in a single payment, in which case

[[Page 236]]

the first installment is to be paid on or before the date prescribed for 
the payment of the excess profit as a single payment, the second 
installment on or before the 15th day of the third month, the third 
installment on or before the 15th day of the sixth month, and the fourth 
installment on or before the 15th day of the ninth month, after such 
date.

Sec. 17.18 Liability of surety. The surety under contracts entered into 
after the amendment of section 3(b) of the act of June 25, 1936 shall 
not be liable for payment of excess profit due the United States in 
respect of such contracts.

Sec. 17.19 Determination of liability for excess profit, interest and 
penalties; assessment, collection, payment, refunds. (a) The duty of 
determining the correct amount of excess profit liability on contracts 
and subcontracts coming within the scope of the act is upon the 
Commissioner of Internal Revenue. Under section 3(b) of the act, as 
amended, and section 651 of the Internal Revenue Code, all provisions of 
law (including the provisions of law relating to interest, penalties and 
refunds) applicable with respect to the taxes imposed by Title I of the 
Revenue Act of 1934 and not inconsistent with section 3 of the act are 
applicable with respect to the assessment, collection, or payment of 
excess profits on contracts and subcontracts coming within the scope of 
the act and to refunds of overpayments of profits into the Treasury 
under the act. Claims by a contracting party for the refund of an amount 
of excess profit, interest, penalties, and additions to such excess 
profit shall conform to the general requirements prescribed with respect 
to claims for refund of overpayments of taxes imposed by Title I of the 
Revenue Act of 1934 and, if filed on account of any additional costs 
incurred pursuant to guarantee provisions in a contract, shall be 
supplemented by a statement under oath showing the amount and nature of 
such costs and all facts pertinent thereto.
    (b) Administrative procedure for the determination, assessment and 
collection of excess profit liability under section 3 of the act, 
sections 650 and 651 of the Internal Revenue Code, and this part, and 
the examination of reports and claims in connection therewith will be 
prescribed from time to time by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.

                  Tax on Transfers To Avoid Income Tax


<R05>
Sec. 1.1491-1  Imposition of tax.

    Section 1491 imposes an excise tax upon transfers of stock or 
securities by a citizen or resident of the United States, or by a 
domestic corporation or partnership, or by a trust which is not a 
foreign trust, to a foreign corporation as paid-in surplus or as a 
contribution to capital, or to a foreign trust, or to a foreign 
partnership. The tax is in an amount equal to 27\1/2\ percent of the 
excess of (a) the value of the stock or securities so transferred over 
(b) its adjusted basis, as provided in section 1011, for determining 
gain in the hands of the transferor.

[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 12082, Nov. 26, 1960]


<R05>
Sec. 1.1492-1  Nontaxable transfers.

    (a) The tax imposed by section 1491 does not apply:
    (1) If the transferee is an organization (other than an organization 
described in section 401(a) exempt from income tax under the provisions 
of sections 501 to 504, inclusive; or
    (2) If before the transfer it has been established to the 
satisfaction of the Commissioner that the transfer is not in pursuance 
of a plan having as one of its principal purposes the avoidance of 
Federal income taxes.
    (b) Whether a transfer of stock or securities is in pursuance of a 
plan having as one of its principal purposes the avoidance of Federal 
income taxes is a question to be determined from the facts and 
circumstances of each particular case. In any such case where a 
transferor desires to establish that the transfer is not in pursuance of 
such a plan, a statement of the facts relating to the plan under which 
the transfer is to be made or was made, together with

[[Page 237]]

a copy of the plan if in writing, shall be forwarded to the Commissioner 
of Internal Revenue, Washington, DC 20225, for a ruling. This statement 
shall contain, or be verified by, a written declaration that it is made 
under the penalties of perjury. A letter notifying the transferor of the 
Commissioner's determination will be mailed to the transferor.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1493-1  Definition of foreign trust.

    For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1967, a trust is to be 
considered a ``foreign trust'' within the meaning of chapter 5 of the 
Code, if, assuming a subsequent sale by the trustee, outside the United 
States and for cash, of the property transferred to the trust, the 
profit, if any, from such sale (being income from sources without the 
United States under the provisions of part I (section 861 and 
following), subchapter N, chapter 1 of the Code), would not be included 
in the gross income of the trust under subtitle A of the Code. For 
taxable years beginning after December 31, 1966, the term ``foreign 
trust,'' as used in chapter 5 of the Code, shall have the meaning 
prescribed by section 7701(a)(31).

[T.D. 7332, 39 FR 44230, Dec. 23, 1974]


<R05>
Sec. 1.1494-1  Returns; payment and collection of tax.

    (a) Returns and payment. Every person making a transfer described in 
section 1491 shall make a return to the district director on the day on 
which the transfer is made and, unless the transfer is nontaxable under 
section 1492, pay the tax due on such transfer. This return, which shall 
contain, or be verified by, a written declaration that it is made under 
the penalties of perjury, shall be made on Form 926 and shall be filed 
with the district director to whom the transferor's return of income is 
required to be made. The return shall set forth in detail the following 
information:
    (1) Name and address of transferor, and place of organization or 
creation, if a corporation, partnership, or trust.
    (2) Name and address of transferee, place of organization or 
creation, and whether the transferee is a foreign corporation, a foreign 
trust, or a foreign partnership. If the transferee is a foreign trust or 
a foreign partnership, the name and address of the fiduciary and each 
beneficiary, in the case of a trust, or of each partner, in the case of 
a partnership, must be shown.
    (3) Description and amount of stock or securities transferred, the 
date of transfer, and a complete statement showing all the facts 
relating to the transfer, accompanied by a copy of the plan under which 
the transfer was made.
    (4) The fair market value of the stock or securities transferred as 
of the date of transfer, and the adjusted basis provided in section 1011 
for determining gain in the hands of the transferor.
    (5) Whether the transfer was made in pursuance of a plan submitted 
to and approved by the Commissioner as not having as one of its 
principal purposes the avoidance of Federal income taxes. If the plan 
has been so approved, a copy of the Commissioner's letter approving the 
plan shall accompany the return.
    (6) Such other information as may be required by the return form.
    (b) Certificate. (1) If the transferee of the stock or securities, 
the transfer of which is reported in the return, is a foreign 
organization meeting the tests of exemption from income tax provided in 
part I (section 501 and following), subchapter F, chapter 1 of the Code, 
and the transferor on that account claims that no liability for tax is 
imposed by section 1491, such transferor must file with Form 926 a 
certificate establishing the exemption of the transferee under such part 
I. This certificate, which shall contain, or be verified by, a written 
declaration that it is made under the penalties of perjury, shall 
contain complete information showing the character of the transferee, 
the purpose for which it was organized, its actual activities, the 
source of its income and the disposition of such income, whether or not 
any of its income is credited to surplus or may inure to the benefit of 
any private shareholder or individual, and in general all facts relating 
to its operations which affect its right to exemption. To such 
certificate shall be attached a copy of the charter or articles

[[Page 238]]

of incorporation, the by-laws of the organization, and the latest 
financial statement showing the assets, liabilities, receipts, and 
disbursements of the organization.
    (2) If the transferee is a foreign organization which has been held 
to be exempt from income tax under such part I (or corresponding 
provisions of prior law), a copy of the Commissioner's letter so holding 
shall be filed with Form 926 in lieu of the above certificate and 
attachments.
    (c) Assessment and collection. The determination, assessment, and 
collection of the tax and the examination of returns and claims filed 
pursuant to chapter 5 of the Code will be made under such procedure as 
may be prescribed from time to time by the Commissioner.

contained in the 26 CFR part 1 edition revised April 1, 1996) are 
applicable to taxable years beginning before January 1, 1966.

[T.D. 8677, 61 FR 33325, June 27, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1.1502-1  Definitions.

    (a) Group. The term group means an affiliated group of corporations 
as defined in section 1504. See Sec. 1.1502-75(d) as to when a group 
remains in existence. Except as the context otherwise requires, 
references to a group are references to a consolidated group (as defined 
in paragraph (h) of this section).
    (b) Member. The term member means a corporation (including the 
common parent) that is included in the group, or as the context may 
require, a corporation that is included in a subgroup.
    (c) Subsidiary. The term subsidiary means a corporation other than 
the common parent which is a member of such group.
    (d) Consolidated return year. The term consolidated return year 
means a taxable year for which a consolidated return is filed or 
required to be filed by such group.
    (e) Separate return year. The term separate return year means a 
taxable year of a corporation for which it files a separate return or 
for which it joins in the filing of a consolidated return by another 
group.
    (f) Separate return limitation year--(1) In general. Except as 
provided in paragraphs (f)(2) and (3) of this section, the term separate 
return limitation year (or SRLY) means any separate return year of a 
member or of a predecessor of a member.
    (2) Exceptions. The term separate return limitation year (or SRLY) 
does not include:
    (i) A separate return year of the corporation which is the common 
parent for the consolidated return year to which the tax attribute is to 
be carried (except as provided in Sec. 1.1502- 75(d)(2)(ii) and 
subparagraph (3) of this paragraph),
    (ii) A separate return year of any corporation which was a member of 
the group for each day of such year, or
    (iii) A separate return year of a predecessor of any member if such 
predecessor was a member of the group for each day of such year,

Provided that an election under section 1562(a) (relating to the 
privilege to elect multiple surtax exemptions) was never effective (or 
is no longer effective as a result of a termination of

[[Page 239]]

such election) for such year. An election under section 1562(a) which is 
effective for a taxable year beginning in 1963 and ending in 1964 shall 
be disregarded.
    (3) Reverse acquisitions. In the event of an acquisition to which 
Sec. 1.1502-75(d)(3) applies, all taxable years of the first 
corporation and of each of its subsidiaries ending on or before the date 
of the acquisition shall be treated as separate return limitation years, 
and the separate return years (if any) of the second corporation and 
each of its subsidiaries shall not be treated as separate return 
limitation years (unless they were so treated immediately before the 
acquisition). For example, if corporation P merges into corporation T, 
and the persons who were stockholders of P immediately before the 
merger, as a result of owning the stock of P, own more than 50 percent 
of the fair market value of the outstanding stock of T, then a loss 
incurred before the merger by T (even though it is the common parent), 
or by a subsidiary of T, is treated as having been incurred in a 
separate return limitation year. Conversely, a loss incurred before the 
merger by P, or by a subsidiary of P in a separate return year during 
all of which such subsidiary was a member of the group of which P was 
the common parent and for which section 1562 was not effective, is 
treated as having been incurred in a year which is not a separate return 
limitation year.
    (4) Predecessor and successors. The term predecessor means a 
transferor or distributor of assets to a member (the successor) in a 
transaction--
    (i) To which section 381(a) applies; or
    (ii) That occurs on or after January 1, 1997, in which the 
successor's basis for the assets is determined, directly or indirectly, 
in whole or in part, by reference to the basis of the assets of the 
transferor or distributor, but in the case of a transaction that occurs 
before June 25, 1999, only if the amount by which basis differs from 
value, in the aggregate, is material. For a transaction that occurs 
before June 25, 1999, only one member may be considered a predecessor to 
or a successor of one other member.
    (g) Consolidated return change of ownership--(1) In general. A 
consolidated return change of ownership occurs during any taxable year 
(referred to in this subparagraph as the ``year of change'') of the 
corporation which is the common parent for the taxable year to which the 
tax attribute is to be carried, if, at the end of the year of change:
    (i) Any one or more of the persons described in section 382(a)(2) 
own a percentage of the fair market value of the outstanding stock of 
such corporation which is more than 50 percentage points greater than 
such person or persons owned at:
    (a) The beginning of such taxable year, or
    (b) The beginning of the preceding taxable year, and
    (ii) The increase in percentage points at the end of such year is 
attributable to:
    (a) A purchase (within the meaning of section 382(a)(4)) by such 
person or persons of such stock, the stock of another corporation owning 
stock in such corporation, or an interest in a partnership or trust 
owning stock in such corporation, or
    (b) A decrease in the amount of such stock outstanding or the amount 
of stock outstanding of another corporation owning stock in such 
corporation, except a decrease resulting from a redemption to pay death 
taxes to which section 303 applies.

For purposes of subdivision (i) (a) and (b) of this subparagraph, the 
beginning of the taxable years specified therein shall be the beginning 
of such taxable years or October 1, 1965, whichever occurs later.
    (2) Operating rules. For purposes of this paragraph:
    (i) The term stock means all shares except nonvoting stock which is 
limited and preferred as to dividends, and
    (ii) Section 318 (relating to constructive ownership of stock) shall 
apply in determining the ownership of stock, except that section 318(a) 
(2)(C) and (3)(C) shall be applied without regard to the 50-percent 
limitation contained therein.
    (3) Old members. The term old members of a group means:
    (i) Those corporations which were members of such group immediately 
preceding the first day of the taxable

[[Page 240]]

year in which the consolidated return change of ownership occurs, or
    (ii) If the group was not in existence prior to the taxable year in 
which the consolidated return change of ownership occurs, the 
corporation which is the common parent for the taxable year to which the 
tax attribute is to be carried.
    (4) Reverse acquisitions. If there has been a consolidated return 
change of ownership of a corporation under subparagraph (1) of this 
paragraph and the stock or assets of such corporation are subsequently 
acquired by another corporation in an acquisition to which Sec. 1.1502-
75(d)(3) applies so that the group of which the former corporation is 
the common parent is treated as continuing in existence, then the ``old 
members'', as defined in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, of such 
group immediately before the acquisition shall continue to be treated as 
``old members'' immediately after the acquisition. For example, assume 
that corporations P and S comprise group PS, and PS undergoes a 
consolidated return change of ownership. Subsequently, the stock of P, 
the common parent, is acquired by corporation T, the common parent of 
group TU, in an acquisition to which section 368(a)(1)(B) and Sec. 
1.1502-75(d)(3) apply. The PS group is treated as continuing in 
existence with T as the common parent. P and S continue to be treated as 
old members, as defined in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph.
    (h) Consolidated group. The term ``consolidated group'' means a 
group filing (or required to file) consolidated returns for the tax 
year.
    (i) [Reserved]
    (j) Affiliated. Corporations are affiliated if they are members of a 
group with each other.

                       Consolidated Tax Liability


<R05>
Sec. 1.1502-2  Computation of tax liability.

    The tax liability of a group for a consolidated return year shall be 
determined by adding together:
    (a) The tax imposed by section 11 on the consolidated taxable income 
for such year (see Sec. 1.1502-11 for the computation of consolidated 
taxable income);
    (b) The tax imposed by section 541 on the consolidated undistributed 
personal holding company income;
    (c) If paragraph (b) of this section does not apply, the aggregate 
of the taxes imposed by section 541 on the separate undistributed 
personal holding company income of the members which are personal 
holding companies;
    (d) If paragraph (b) of this section does not apply, the tax imposed 
by section 531 on the consolidated accumulated taxable income (see Sec. 
1.1502-43);
    (e) The tax imposed by section 594(a) in lieu of the taxes imposed 
by section 11 or 1201 on the taxable income of a life insurance 
department of the common parent of a group which is a mutual savings 
bank;
    (f) The tax imposed by section 802(a) on consolidated life insurance 
company taxable income;
    (g) The tax imposed by section 831(a) on the consolidated insurance 
company taxable income of the members which are subject to such tax;
    (h) The tax imposed by section 1201, instead of the taxes computed 
under paragraphs (a) and (g) of this section, computed by reference to 
the net capital gain of the group (see Sec. 1.1502-22) (or, for 
consolidated return years to which Sec. 1.1502-22 does not apply, 
computed by reference to the excess of the consolidated net long-term 
capital gain over the consolidated net short-term capital loss (see 
Sec. 1.1502-41A for the determination of the consolidated net long-term 
capital gain and the consolidated net short-term capital loss));
    (i) [Reserved]
    (j) The tax imposed by section 1333 on war loss recoveries; and

[[Page 241]]


by allowing as a credit against such taxes the investment credit under 
section 38 (see Sec. 1.1502-3), and the foreign tax credit under 
section 33 (see Sec. 1.1502-4). For purposes of this section, the 
surtax exemption of the group for a consolidated return year is $25,000, 
or if a lesser amount is allowed under section 1561, such lesser amount. 
See Sec. 1.1561-2(a)(2). For increase in tax due to the application of 
section 47, see Sec. 1.1502-3(f). For amount of tax surcharge, see 
section 51 and Sec. 1.1502-7.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1502-3   Consolidated tax credits.

    (a) Determination of amount of consolidated credit--(1) In general. 
The credit allowed by section 38 for a consolidated return year of a 
group shall be equal to the consolidated credit earned. The consolidated 
credit earned is equal to the aggregate of the credit earned (as 
determined under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph) by all members of 
the group for the consolidated return year.
    (2) Determination of credit earned. The credit earned of a member is 
an amount equal to 7 percent of such member's qualified investment 
(determined under section 46(c)). For purposes of computing a member's 
qualified investment, the basis of property shall not include any gain 
or loss realized with respect to such property by another member in an 
intercompany transaction (as defined in Sec. 1.1502-13(b)), whether or 
not such gain or loss is deferred. Thus, if section 38 property acquired 
in an intercompany transaction has a basis of $100 to the purchasing 
member, and if the selling member has a $20 gain with respect to such 
property, the basis of such property for purposes of computing the 
purchaser's qualified investment is only $80. Such $80 basis shall also 
be used for purposes of applying section 47 to such property. See 
paragraph (f) of this section.
    (3) Consolidated limitation based on amount of tax. (i) 
Notwithstanding the amount of the consolidated credit earned for the 
taxable year, the consolidated credit allowed by section 38 to the group 
for the consolidated return year is limited to:
    (a) So much of the consolidated liability for tax as does not exceed 
$25,000, plus
    (b) For taxable years ending on or before March 9, 1967, 25 percent 
of the consolidated liability for tax in excess of $25,000, or
    (c) For taxable years ending after March 9, 1967, 50 percent of the 
consolidated liability for tax in excess of $25,000.

The $25,000 amount referred to in the preceding sentence shall be 
reduced by any part of such $25,000 amount apportioned under Sec. 1.46-
1 to component members of the controlled group (as defined in section 
46(a)(5)) which do not join in the filing of the consolidated return. 
For further rules for computing the limitation based on amount of tax 
with respect to the suspension period (as defined in section 48(j)), see 
section 46(a)(2). The amount determined under this subparagraph is 
referred to in this section as the ``consolidated limitation based on 
amount of tax.''
    (ii) If an organization to which section 593 applies or a 
cooperative organization described in section 1381(a) joins in the 
filing of the consolidated return, the $25,000 amount referred to in 
subdivision (i) of this subparagraph (reduced as provided in such 
subdivision) shall be apportioned equally among the members of the group 
filing the consolidated return. The amount so apportioned equally to any 
such organization shall then be decreased in accordance with the 
provisions of section 46(d). Finally, the sum of all such equal portions 
(as decreased under section 46(d)) of each member of the group shall be 
substituted for the $25,000 amount referred to in subdivision (i) of 
this subparagraph.
    (4) Consolidated liability for tax. For purposes of subparagraph (3) 
of this paragraph, the consolidated liability for tax shall be the 
income tax imposed for the taxable year upon the group by chapter 1 of 
the Code, reduced by the consolidated foreign tax credit allowable under 
Sec. 1.1502-4. The tax imposed by section 56 (relating to minimum tax 
for tax preferences), section 531 (relating to accumulated earnings 
tax), section 541 (relating to personal holding

[[Page 242]]

company tax), and any additional tax imposed by section 1351(d)(1) 
(relating to recoveries of foreign expropriation losses), shall not be 
considered tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code. In addition, any 
increase in tax resulting from the application of section 47 (relating 
to certain dispositions, etc., of section 38 property) shall not be 
treated as tax imposed by chapter 1 for purposes of computing the 
consolidated liability for tax.
    (b) Carryback and carryover of unused credits--(1) Allowance of 
unused credit as consolidated carryback or carryover. A group shall be 
allowed to add to the amount allowable as a credit under paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section for any consolidated return year an amount equal 
to the aggregate of the consolidated investment credit carryovers and 
carrybacks to such year. The consolidated investment credit carryovers 
and carrybacks to the taxable year shall consist of any consolidated 
unused credits of the group, plus any unused credits of members of the 
group arising in separate return years of such members, which may be 
carried over or back to the taxable year under the principles of section 
46(b). However, such consolidated carryovers and carrybacks shall not 
include any consolidated unused credits apportioned to a corporation for 
a separate return year pursuant to paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.1502-79 and 
shall be subject to the limitations contained in paragraphs (c) and (e) 
of this section. A consolidated unused credit for any consolidated 
return year is the excess of the consolidated credit earned over the 
consolidated limitation based on amount of tax for such year.
    (2) Absorption rules. For purposes of determining the amount, if 
any, of an unused credit (whether consolidated or separate) which can be 
carried to a taxable year (consolidated or separate), the amount of such 
unused credit which is absorbed in a prior consolidated return year 
under section 46(b) shall be determined by:
    (i) Applying all unused credits which can be carried to such prior 
year in the order of the taxable years in which such unused credits 
arose, beginning with the taxable year which ends earliest, and
    (ii) Applying all such unused credits which can be carried to such 
prior year from taxable years ending on the same date on a pro rata 
basis.
    (3) Example. The provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section may be illustrated by the following example:

    Example. (i) Corporation P is incorporated on January 1, 1966. On 
that same day P incorporates corporation S, a wholly owned subsidiary. P 
and S file consolidated returns for calendar years 1966 and 1967. P's 
and S's credit earned, the consolidated credit earned, and the 
consolidated limitation based on amount of tax for 1966 and 1967 are as 
follows:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                                                  Consolidated
                                                           Credit earned       Consolidated     limitation based
                                                                              credit earned     on amount of tax
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1966:
  P....................................................            $60,000
  S....................................................            $30,000            $90,000           $100,000
1967:
  P....................................................            $40,000
  S....................................................            $25,000            $65,000            $50,000
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) P's and S's credit earned for 1966 are aggregated, and the 
group's consolidated credit earned, $90,000, is allowable in full to the 
group as a credit under section 38 for 1966 since such amount is less 
than the consolidated limitation based on amount of tax for 1966, 
$100,000.
    (iii) Since the consolidated limitation based on amount of tax for 
1967 is $50,000, only $50,000 of the $65,000 consolidated credit earned 
for such year is allowable to the group under section 38 as a credit for 
1967. The consolidated unused credit for 1967 of $15,000 ($65,000 less 
$50,000) is a consolidated investment credit carryback and carryover to 
the years prescribed in section 46(b). In this case the consolidated 
unused credit is a consolidated investment credit carryback to 1966 
(since P and S were not in existence in 1964 and 1965) and a 
consolidated investment credit carryover to 1968 and subsequent years. 
The portion of the consolidated unused credit for 1967 which is 
allowable as a credit for 1966 is $10,000. This amount shall be

[[Page 243]]

added to the amount allowable as a credit to the group for 1966. The 
balance of the consolidated unused credit for 1967 to be carried to 1968 
is $5,000. These amounts are computed as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Consolidated carryback to 1966...  ...........  ...........      $15,000
  1966 consolidated limitation     ...........     $100,000  ...........
   based on tax..................
Less: Consolidated credit earned       $90,000
 for 1966........................
  Consolidated unused credits                0      $90,000  ...........
   attributable to years
   preceding 1967................
                                  --------------
Limit on amount of 1967            ...........  ...........      $10,000
 consolidated unused credit which
 may be added as a credit for
 1966............................
                                  --------------
Balance of 1967 consolidated       ...........  ...........       $5,000
 unused credit to be carried to
 1968............................
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) Limitation on investment credit carryovers and carrybacks from 
separate return limitation years applicable for consolidated return 
years for which the due date of the return is on or before March 13, 
1998--(1) General rule. In the case of an unused credit of a member of 
the group arising in a separate return limitation year (as defined in 
Sec. 1.1502-1(f)) of such member (and in a separate return limitation 
year of any predecessor of such member), the amount which may be 
included under paragraph (b) of this section (computed without regard to 
the limitation contained in paragraph (e) of this section) shall not 
exceed the amount determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
    (2) Computation of limitation. The amount referred to in paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section with respect to a member of the group is the 
excess, if any, of--
    (i) The limitation based on amount of tax of the group, minus such 
limitation recomputed by excluding the items of income, deduction, and 
foreign tax credit of such member; over
    (ii) The sum of the investment credit earned by such member for such 
consolidated return year, and the unused credits attributable to such 
member which may be carried to such consolidated return year arising in 
unused credit years ending prior to the particular separate return 
limitation year.
    (3) Special effective date. This paragraph (c) applies to 
consolidated return years for which the due date of the income tax 
return (without extensions) is on or before March 13, 1998. See 
paragraph (d) of this section for the rule that limits the group's use 
of a section 38 credit carryover or carryback from a SRLY for a 
consolidated return year for which the due date of the income tax return 
(without extensions) is after March 13, 1998. See also paragraph (d)(4) 
of this section for an optional effective date rule (generally making 
the rules of this paragraph (c) inapplicable to a consolidated return 
year beginning after December 31, 1996, if the due date of the income 
tax return (without extensions) for such year is on or before March 13, 
1998).
    (4) Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (c) may be 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. (i) Assume the same facts as in the example contained in 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section, except that all the stock of 
corporation T, also a calendar year taxpayer, is acquired by P on 
January 1, 1968, and that P, S, and T file a consolidated return for 
1968. In 1966, T had an unused credit of $10,000 which has not been 
absorbed and is available as an investment credit carryover to 1968. 
Such carryover is from a separate return limitation year. P's and S's 
credit earned for 1968 is $10,000 each, and T's credit earned is $8,000; 
the consolidated credit earned is therefore $28,000. The group's 
consolidated limitation based on amount of tax for 1968 is $50,000. Such 
limitation recomputed by excluding the items of income, deduction, and 
foreign tax credit of T is $30,000. Thus, the amount determined under 
paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section is $20,000 ($50,000 minus $30,000). 
Accordingly, the limitation on the carryover of T's unused credit is 
$12,000, the excess of $20,000 over $8,000 (the sum of T's credit earned 
for the taxable year and any carryovers from prior unused credit years 
(none in this case)). Therefore T's $10,000 unused credit from 1966 may 
be carried over to

[[Page 244]]

the consolidated return year without limitation.
    (ii) The group's consolidated credit earned for 1968, $28,000, is 
allowable in full as a credit under section 38 since such amount is less 
than the consolidated limitation based on amount of tax, $50,000.
    (iii) The group's consolidated investment credit carryover to 1968 
is $15,000, consisting of the consolidated unused credits of the group 
($5,000) plus T's separate return year unused credit ($10,000). The 
entire $15,000 consolidated carryover shall be added to the amount 
allowable to the group as a credit under section 38 for 1968, since such 
amount is less than $22,000 (the excess of the consolidated limitation 
based on tax, $50,000, over the sum of the consolidated credit earned 
for 1968, $28,000, and unused credits arising in prior unused credit 
years, zero).
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except that the 
amount determined under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section is $12,000. 
Therefore, the limitation on the carryover of T's unused credit is 
$4,000. Accordingly, the consolidated investment credit carryover is 
only $9,000 since the amount of T's separate return year unused credit 
which may be added to the group's $ 5,000 consolidated unused credit is 
$4,000. These amounts are computed as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
T's carryover to 1968............  ...........  ...........      $10,000
  Consolidated limitation based    ...........      $12,000  ...........
   on amount of tax minus
   recomputed limitation.........
Less: T's credit earned for 1968.       $8,000  ...........  ...........
  Unused credits attributable to             0       $8,000  ...........
   T arising in unused credit
   years preceding 1966..........
                                  --------------
 Limit on amount of 1966 unused    ...........  ...........       $4,000
 credit of T which may be added
 to consolidated investment
 credit carryover................
                                  --------------
Balance of 1966 unused credit of   ...........  ...........       $6,000
 T to be carried to 1969 (subject
 to the limitation contained in
 paragraph (c) of this section)..
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (d) Limitation on tax credit carryovers and carrybacks from separate 
return limitation years applicable for consolidated return years for 
which the due date of the return is after March 13, 1998--(1) General 
rule. The aggregate of a member's unused section 38 credits arising in 
SRLYs that are included in the consolidated section 38 credits for all 
consolidated return years of the group may not exceed--
    (i) The aggregate for all consolidated return years of the member's 
contributions to the consolidated section 38(c) limitation for each 
consolidated return year; reduced by
    (ii) The aggregate of the member's section 38 credits arising and 
absorbed in all consolidated return years (whether or not absorbed by 
the member).
    (2) Computational rules--(i) Member's contribution to the 
consolidated section 38(c) limitation. If the consolidated section 38(c) 
limitation for a consolidated return year is determined by reference to 
the consolidated tentative minimum tax (see section 38(c)(1)(A)), then a 
member's contribution to the consolidated section 38(c) limitation for 
such year equals the member's share of the consolidated net income tax 
minus the member's share of the consolidated tentative minimum tax. If 
the consolidated section 38(c) limitation for a consolidated return year 
is determined by reference to the consolidated net regular tax liability 
(see section 38(c)(1)(B)), then a member's contribution to the 
consolidated section 38(c) limitation for such year equals the member's 
share of the consolidated net income tax minus 25 percent of the 
quantity which is equal to so much of the member's share of the 
consolidated net regular tax liability less its portion of the $25,000 
amount specified in section 38(c)(1)(B). The group computes the member's 
shares by applying to the respective consolidated amounts the principles 
of section 1552 and the percentage method under Sec. 1.1502-33(d)(3), 
assuming a 100% allocation of any decreased tax liability. The group 
must

[[Page 245]]

make proper adjustments so that taxes and credits not taken into account 
in computing the limitation under section 38(c) are not taken into 
account in computing the member's share of the consolidated net income 
tax, etc. (See, for example, the taxes described in section 26(b) that 
are disregarded in computing regular tax liability.) Also, the group may 
apportion all or a part of the $25,000 amount (or lesser amount if 
reduced by section 38(c)(3)) for any year to one or more members.
    (ii) Years included in computation. For purposes of computing the 
limitation under this paragraph (d), the consolidated return years of 
the group include only those years, including the year to which a credit 
is carried, that the member has been continuously included in the 
group's consolidated return, but exclude--
    (A) For carryovers, any years ending after the year to which the 
credit is carried; and
    (B) For carrybacks, any years ending after the year in which the 
credit arose.
    (iii) Subgroups and successors. The SRLY subgroup principles under 
Sec. 1.1502-21(c)(2) apply for purposes of this paragraph (d). The 
predecessor and successor principles under Sec. 1.1502-21(f) also apply 
for purposes of this paragraph (d).
    (iv) Overlap with section 383. The principles under Sec. 1.1502-
21(g) apply for purposes of this paragraph (d). For example, an overlap 
of paragraph (d) of this section and the application of section 383 with 
respect to a credit carryover occurs if a corporation becomes a member 
of a consolidated group (the SRLY event) within six months of the change 
date of an ownership change giving rise to a section 383 credit 
limitation with respect to that carryover (the section 383 event), with 
the result that the limitation of this paragraph (d) does not apply. See 
Sec. Sec. 1.1502-21(g)(2)(ii)(A) and 1.383-1; see also Sec. 1.1502-
21(g)(4) (subgroup rules).
    (3) Effective date--(i) In general. This paragraph (d) generally 
applies to consolidated return years for which the due date of the 
income tax return (without extensions) is after March 13, 1998.
    (A) Contribution years. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(4)(ii) 
of this section, a group does not take into account a consolidated 
taxable year for which the due date of the income tax return (without 
extensions) is on or before March 13, 1998, in determining a member's 
(or subgroup's) contributions to the consolidated section 38(c) 
limitation under this paragraph (d).
    (B) Special subgroup rule. In the event that the principles of Sec. 
1.1502-21(g)(1) do not apply to a particular credit carryover in the 
current group, then solely for purposes of applying paragraph (d) of 
this section to determine the limitation with respect to that carryover 
and with respect to which the SRLY register (the aggregate of the 
member's or subgroup's contribution to consolidated section 38(c) 
limitation reduced by the aggregate of the member's or subgroup's 
section 38 credits arising and absorbed in all consolidated return 
years) began in a taxable year for which the due date of the return is 
on or before May 25, 2000, the principles of Sec. 1.1502-21(c)(2) shall 
be applied without regard to the phrase ``or for a carryover that was 
subject to the overlap rule described in paragraph (g) of this section 
or Sec. 1.1502-15(g) with respect to another group (the former 
group).''
    (ii) Overlap rule. Paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section (relating to 
overlap with section 383) applies to taxable years for which the due 
date (without extensions) of the consolidated return is after May 25, 
2000. For purposes of paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section, only an 
ownership change to which section 383, as amended by the Tax Reform Act 
of 1986 (100 Stat. 2085), applies and which results in a section 383 
credit limitation shall constitute a section 383 event.
    (4) Optional effective date of January 1, 1997. (i) For consolidated 
taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 1997, for which the due 
date of the income tax return (without extensions) is on or before March 
13, 1998, in lieu of paragraphs (c) and (e)(3) of this section (relating 
to the general business credit), Sec. 1.1502-4(f)(3) and (g)(3) 
(relating to the foreign tax credit), the next to last sentence of Sec. 
1.1502-9A(a)(2), Sec. 1.1502-9A(b)(1)(v) (relating to overall foreign

[[Page 246]]

losses), and Sec. 1.1502-55(h)(4)(iii) (relating to the alternative 
minimum tax credit), a consolidated group may apply the corresponding 
provisions as they appear in 1998-1 C.B. 655 through 661 (see Sec. 
601.601(d)(2) of this chapter) (treating references in such 
corresponding provisions to Sec. Sec. 1.1502-9(b)(1)(ii), (iii), and 
(iv) as references to Sec. Sec. 1.1502-9A(b)(1)(ii), (iii), and (iv)). 
Also, in the case of a consolidated return change of ownership that 
occurs on or after January 1, 1997, in a taxable year for which the due 
date of the income tax return (without extensions) is on or before March 
13, 1998, a consolidated group may choose not to apply paragraph (e) of 
this section and Sec. 1.1502-4(g) to taxable years ending after 
December 31, 1996. A consolidated group making the choices described in 
the two preceding sentences generally must apply all such corresponding 
provisions (including not applying paragraph (e) of this section and 
Sec. 1.1502-4(g)) for all relevant years. However, a consolidated group 
making the election provided in Sec. 1.1502-9A(b)(1)(vi) (electing not 
to apply Sec. 1.1502-9A(b)(1)(v) to years beginning before January 1, 
1998) may nevertheless choose to apply all such corresponding provisions 
referred to in this paragraph (d)(4)(i) other than the provision 
corresponding to Sec. 1.1502-9A(b)(1)(v) for all relevant years.
    (ii) If a consolidated group chooses to apply the corresponding 
provisions referred to in paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section, the 
consolidated group shall not take into account a consolidated taxable 
year beginning before January 1, 1997, in determining a member's (or 
subgroup's) contributions to the consolidated section 38(c) limitation 
under this paragraph (d).
    (5) Example. The following example illustrates the provisions of 
this paragraph (d):

    Example. (i) Individual A owns all of the stock of P and T. P is the 
common parent of the P group. P acquires all the stock of T at the 
beginning of Year 2. T carries over an unused section 38 general 
business credit from Year 1 of $100,000. The table in paragraph (i) of 
this Example shows the group's net consolidated income tax, consolidated 
tentative minimum tax, and consolidated net regular tax liabilities, and 
T's share of such taxes computed under the principles of section 1552 
and the percentage method under Sec. 1.1502-33(d)(3), assuming a 100% 
allocation of any decreased tax liability, for Year 2. (The effects of 
the lower section 11 brackets are ignored, there are no other tax 
credits affecting a group amount or member's share, and $1,000s are 
omitted.)

[[Page 247]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR25MY00.002

    (ii) T's Year 1 is a SRLY with respect to the P group. See Sec. 
1.1502-1(f)(2)(ii). T did not undergo an ownership change giving rise to 
a section 383 credit limitation within 6 months of joining the P group. 
Thus, T's $100,000 general business credit arising in Year 1 is subject 
to a SRLY limitation in the P group. The amount of T's unused section 38 
credits from Year 1 that are included in the consolidated section 38 
credits for Year 2 may not exceed T's contribution to the consolidated 
section 38(c) limitation. For Year 2, the group determines the 
consolidated section 38(c) limitation by reference to consolidated 
tentative minimum tax for Year 2. Therefore, T's contribution to the 
consolidated section 38(c) limitation for Year 2 equals its share of 
consolidated net income tax minus its share of consolidated tentative 
minimum tax. T's contribution is $280,000 minus $160,000, or $120,000. 
However, because the

[[Page 248]]

group has a consolidated section 38 limitation of zero, it may not 
include any of T's unused section 38 credits in the consolidated section 
38 credits for Year 2.
    (iii) The following table shows similar information for the group 
for Year 3:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR25MY00.003

    (iv) The amount of T's unused section 38 credits from Year 1 that 
are included in the consolidated section 38 credits for Year 3 may not 
exceed T's aggregate contribution to the consolidated section 38(c) 
limitation

[[Page 249]]

for Years 2 and 3. For Year 3, the group determines the consolidated 
section 38(c) limitation by reference to the consolidated tentative 
minimum tax for Year 3. Therefore, T's contribution to the consolidated 
section 38(c) limitation for Year 3 equals its share of consolidated net 
income tax minus its share of consolidated tentative minimum tax. 
Applying the principles of section 1552 and Sec. 1.1502-33(d) (taking 
into account, for example, that T's positive earnings and profits 
adjustment under Sec. 1.1502-33(d) reflects its losses actually 
absorbed by the group), T's contribution is $(105,000) minus $(40,000), 
or $(65,000). T's aggregate contribution to the consolidated section 
38(c) limitation for Years 2 and 3 is $120,000 + $(65,000), or $55,000. 
The group may include $55,000 of T's Year 1 unused section 38 credits in 
its consolidated section 38 tax credit in Year 3.


    (e) Limitation on investment credit carryovers where there has been 
a consolidated return change of ownership-- (1) General rule. If a 
consolidated return change of ownership (as defined in paragraph (g) of 
Sec. 1.1502-1) occurs during the taxable year or an earlier taxable 
year, the amount which may be included under paragraph (b) of this 
section in the consolidated investment credit carryovers to the taxable 
year with respect to the aggregate unused credits attributable to old 
members of the group (as defined in paragraph (g)(3) of Sec. 1.1502-1) 
arising in taxable years (consolidated or separate) ending on the same 
day and before the taxable year in which the consolidated return change 
of ownership occurred shall not exceed the amount determined under 
subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.
    (2) Computation of limitation. The amount referred to in 
subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall be the excess of the 
consolidated limitation based on the amount of tax for the taxable year, 
recomputed by including only the items of income, deduction, and foreign 
tax credit of the old members, over the sum of:
    (i) The aggregate investment credits earned by the old members for 
the taxable year, and
    (ii) The aggregate unused investment credits attributable to the old 
members which may be carried to the taxable year arising in unused 
credit years ending prior to the particular unused credit year or years.
    (3) Special effective date. This paragraph (e) applies only to a 
consolidated return change of ownership that occurred during a 
consolidated return year for which the due date of the income tax return 
(without extensions) is on or before March 13, 1998. See paragraph 
(d)(4) of this section for an optional effective date rule (generally 
making the rules of this paragraph (e) also inapplicable if the 
consolidated return change of ownership occurred on or after January 1, 
1997, and during a consolidated return year for which the due date of 
the income tax return (without extensions) is on or before March 13, 
1998).
    (f) Early dispositions, etc., of section 38 property--(1) 
Dispositions of section 38 property during and after consolidated return 
year. If property is subject to section 47(a) (1) or (2) with respect to 
a member during a consolidated return year, any increase in tax shall be 
added to the tax liability of the group under Sec. 1.1502-2 (regardless 
of whether the property was placed in service in a consolidated or 
separate return year). Also, if property is subject to section 47(a) (1) 
or (2) with respect to a corporation during a taxable year for which 
such corporation files on a separate return basis, any increase in tax 
shall be added to the tax liability of such corporation (regardless of 
whether such property was placed in service in a consolidated or 
separate return year).
    (2) Exception for transfer to another member. (i) Except as provided 
in subdivisions (ii) and (iii) of this subparagraph, a transfer of 
section 38 property from one member of the group to another member of 
such group during a consolidated return year shall not be treated as a 
disposition or cessation within the meaning of section 47(a)(1). If such 
section 38 property is disposed of, or otherwise ceases to be section 38 
property or becomes public utility property with respect to the 
transferee, before the close of the estimated useful life which was 
taken into account in computing qualified investment, then section 47(a) 
(1) or (2) shall apply to the transferee with respect to such property 
(determined by taking into account the period of use, qualified 
investment, other dispositions, etc., of the transferor). Any increase 
in tax due to the application of section 47(a) (1) or (2) shall be added 
to the tax liability of

[[Page 250]]

such transferee (or the tax liability of a group, if the transferee 
joins in the filing of a consolidated return).
    (ii) Except as provided in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph, 
if section 38 property is disposed of during a consolidated return year 
by one member of the group to another member of such group which is an 
organization to which section 593 applies or a cooperative organization 
described in section 1381(a), the tax under chapter 1 of the Code for 
such consolidated return year shall be increased by an amount equal to 
the aggregate decrease in the credits allowed under section 38 for all 
prior taxable years which would result solely from treating such 
property, for purposes of determining qualified investment, as placed in 
service by such organization to which section 593 applies or such 
cooperative organization described in section 1381(a), as the case may 
be, but with due regard to the use of the property before such transfer.
    (iii) Section 47(a)(1) shall apply to a transfer of section 38 
property by a corporation during a consolidated return year if such 
corporation is liquidated in a transaction to which section 334(b)(2) 
applies.
    (3) Examples. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by 
the following examples:

    Example (1). P, S, and T file a consolidated return for calendar 
year 1967. In such year S places in service section 38 property having 
an estimated useful life of more than 8 years. In 1968, P, S, and T file 
a consolidated return and in such year S sells such property to T. Such 
sale will not cause section 47(a)(1) to apply.
    Example (2). Assume the same facts as in example (1), except that P, 
S, and T filed separate returns for 1967. The sale from S to T will not 
cause section 47(a)(1) to apply.
    Example (3). Assume the same facts as in example (1), except that P, 
S, and T continue to file consolidated returns through 1971 and in such 
year T disposes of the property to individual A. Section 47(a)(1) will 
apply to the group and any increase in tax shall be added to the tax 
liability of the group. For the purposes of determining the actual 
period of use by T, such period shall include S's period of use.
    Example (4). Assume the same facts as in example (3), except that T 
files a separate return in 1971. Again, the actual periods of use by S 
and T will be combined in applying section 47. If the disposition 
results in an increase in tax under section 47(a)(1), such additional 
tax shall be added to the separate tax liability of T.
    Example (5). Assume the same facts as in example (1), except that in 
1969, P sells all the stock of T to a third party. Such sale will not 
cause section 47(a)(1) to apply.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1502-4  Consolidated foreign tax credit.

    (a) In general. The credit under section 901 for taxes paid or 
accrued to any foreign country or possession of the United States shall 
be allowed to the group only if the common parent corporation chooses to 
use such credit in the computation of the tax liability of the group for 
the consolidated return year. If this choice is made, no deduction may 
be taken on the consolidated return for such taxes paid or accrued by 
any member of the group. See section 275(a)(4).
    (b) Limitation effective under section 904(a) for the group--(1) 
Common parent's limitation effective for group. The determination of 
whether the overall limitation or the per-country limitation applies for 
a consolidated return year shall be made by reference to the limitation 
effective with respect to the common parent corporation for such year. 
If the limitation effective with respect to a member for its immediately 
preceding separate return year differs from the limitation effective 
with respect to the common parent corporation for the consolidated 
return year, then such member shall, if the overall limitation is 
effective with respect to the common parent, be deemed to have made an 
election to use such overall limitation, or, if the per-country 
limitation is effective with respect to the common parent, be deemed to 
have revoked its election to use the overall limitation. Consent of the 
Secretary or his delegate (if otherwise required) is hereby given to 
such member for such election or revocation. Any such election or 
revocation shall apply only prospectively beginning with such 
consolidated return year.

[[Page 251]]

    (2) Limitation effective for subsequent years. The limitation 
effective with respect to a member for the last year for which it joins 
in the filing of a consolidated return with a group shall remain in 
effect for a subsequent separate return year and may be changed by such 
corporation for such subsequent year only in accordance with the 
provisions of section 904(b) (and this paragraph if it joins in the 
filing of a consolidated return with another group). Any retroactive 
change in the limitation by the common parent corporation for such 
member's last consolidated return year shall change the election 
effective with respect to such member for such last period. Thus, if the 
common parent (P) elects the overall limitation with respect to calendar 
year 1966, such election would be effective with respect to its 
subsidiary S for 1966. If S leaves the group at the beginning of 
calendar year 1967, such election shall be effective for 1967 with 
respect to S (unless S revokes such election for 1967 or a subsequent 
year in accordance with section 904(b), or this paragraph if it joins in 
the filing of a consolidated return with another group). However, if P 
retroactively changes back to the per-country limitation with respect to 
1966, such limitation would be effective with respect to S for 1966 and 
subsequent years (unless S elects the overall limitation for any such 
subsequent year).
    (c) Computation of consolidated foreign tax credit. The foreign tax 
credit for the consolidated return year shall be determined on a 
consolidated basis under the principles of sections 901 through 905 and 
section 960. For example, if the per-country limitations applies to the 
consolidated return year, taxes paid or accrued for such year (including 
those deemed paid or accrued under sections 902 and 960(a) and paragraph 
(e) of this section) to each foreign country or possession by the 
members of the group shall be aggregated. If the overall limitation 
applies, taxes paid or accrued for such year (including those deemed 
paid or accrued) to all foreign countries and possessions by members of 
the group shall be aggregated. If the overall limitation applies and a 
member of the group qualifies as a Western Hemisphere trade corporation, 
see section 1503(b).
    (d) Computation of limitation on credit. For purposes of computing 
the group's applicable limitation under section 904(a), the following 
rules shall apply:
    (1) Computation of taxable income from foreign sources. The 
numerator of the applicable limiting fraction under section 904(a) shall 
be an amount (not in excess of the amount determined under subparagraph 
(2) of this paragraph) equal to the aggregate of the separate taxable 
incomes of the members from sources within each foreign country or 
possession of the United States (if the per-country limitation is 
applicable), or from sources without the United States (if the overall 
limitation is applicable), determined under Sec. 1.1502-12, adjusted 
for the following items taken into account in the computation of 
consolidated taxable income:
    (i) The portion of the consolidated net operating loss deduction, 
the consolidated charitable contributions deduction, the consolidated 
dividends received deduction, and the consolidated section 922 
deduction, attributable to such foreign source income;
    (ii) Any such foreign source capital gain net income (net capital 
gain for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) (determined 
without regard to any net capital loss carryover or carryback);
    (iii) Any such foreign source net capital loss and section 1231 net 
loss, reduced by the portion of the consolidated net capital loss 
attributable to such foreign source loss; and
    (iv) The portion of any consolidated net capital loss carryover or 
carryback attributable to such foreign source income which is absorbed 
in the taxable year.
    (2) Computation of entire taxable income. The denominator of the 
applicable limiting fraction under section 904(a) (that is, the entire 
taxable income of the group) shall be the consolidated taxable income of 
the group computed in accordance with Sec. 1.1502-11.
    (3) Computation of tax against which credit is taken. The tax 
against which the limiting fraction under section 904(a) is applied 
shall be the consolidated tax liability of the group determined under 
Sec. 1.1502-2, but without regard to paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (j)

[[Page 252]]

thereof, and without regard to any credit against such liability.
    (e) Carryover and carryback of unused foreign tax--(1) Allowance of 
unused foreign tax as consolidated carryover or carryback. The aggregate 
of the consolidated unused foreign tax carryovers and carrybacks to the 
taxable year, to the extent absorbed for such year under the principles 
of section 904(d), shall be deemed to be paid or accrued to a foreign 
country or possession for such year. The consolidated unused foreign tax 
carryovers and carrybacks to the taxable year shall consist of any 
consolidated unused foreign tax, plus any unused foreign tax of members 
for separate return years of such members, which may be carried over or 
back to the taxable year under the principles of section 904 (d) and 
(e). However, such consolidated carryovers and carrybacks shall not 
include any consolidated unused foreign taxes apportioned to a 
corporation for a separate return year pursuant to Sec. 1.1502-79(d) 
and shall be subject to the limitations contained in paragraphs (f) and 
(g) of this section. A consolidated unused foreign tax is the excess of 
the foreign taxes paid or accrued by the group (or deemed paid or 
accrued by the group, other than by reason of section 904(d) over the 
applicable limitation for the consolidated return year.
    (2) Absorption rules. For purposes of determining the amount, if 
any, of an unused foreign tax (consolidated or separate) which can be 
carried to a taxable year (consolidated or separate), the amount of such 
unused tax which is absorbed in a prior consolidated return year under 
section 904(d) shall be determined by:
    (i) Applying all unused foreign taxes which can be carried to such 
prior year in the order of the taxable years in which such unused taxes 
arose, beginning with the taxable year which ends earliest, and
    (ii) Applying all such unused taxes which can be carried to such 
prior year from taxable years ending on the same date on a pro rata 
basis.
    (f) Limitation on unused foreign tax carryover or carryback from 
separate return limitation years--(1) General rule. In the case of an 
unused foreign tax of a member of the group arising in a separate return 
limitation year (as defined in paragraph (f) of Sec. 1.1502-1) of such 
member, the amount which may be included under paragraph (e) of this 
section (computed without regard to the limitation contained in 
paragraph (g) of this section) shall not exceed the amount determined 
under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.
    (2) Computation of limitation. The amount referred to in 
subparagraph (1) of this paragraph with respect to a member of the group 
is the excess, if any, of:
    (i) The section 904(a) limitation of the group, minus such 
limitation recomputed by excluding the items of income and deduction of 
such member, over
    (ii) The sum of (a) the foreign taxes paid (or deemed paid, other 
than by reason of section 904(d)) by such member for the consolidated 
return year, and (b) the unused foreign tax attributable to such member 
which may be carried to such consolidated return year arising in taxable 
years ending prior to the particular separate return limitation year.
    (3) Limitation on unused foreign tax credit carryover or carryback 
from separate return limitation years. Paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this 
section do not apply for consolidated return years for which the due 
date of the income tax return (without extensions) is after March 13, 
1998. For consolidated return years for which the due date of the income 
tax return (without extensions) is after March 13, 1998, a group shall 
include an unused foreign tax of a member arising in a SRLY without 
regard to the contribution of the member to consolidated tax liability 
for the consolidated return year. See also Sec. 1.1502-3(d)(4) for an 
optional effective date rule (generally making the rules of paragraphs 
(f)(1) and (2) of this section also inapplicable to a consolidated 
return year beginning on or after January 1, 1997, if the due date of 
the income tax return (without extensions) for such year is on or before 
March 13, 1998).
    (g) Limitation on unused foreign tax carryover where there has been 
a consolidated return change of ownership--(1) General rule. If a 
consolidated return change of ownership (as defined in

[[Page 253]]

paragraph (g) of Sec. 1.1502-1) occurs during the taxable year or an 
earlier taxable year, the amount which may be included under paragraph 
(e) of this section in the consolidated unused foreign tax carryovers to 
the taxable year with respect to the aggregate unused credits 
attributable to the old members of the group (as defined in paragraph 
(g)(3) of Sec. 1.1502-1) arising in taxable years (consolidated or 
separate) ending on the same day and before the taxable year in which 
the consolidated return change of ownership occurred shall not exceed 
the amount determined under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.
    (2) Computation of limitation. The amount referred to in 
subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall be the excess of the section 
904(a) limitation of the group for the taxable year, recomputed by 
including only the items of income and deduction of the old members of 
the group, over the sum of:
    (i) The aggregate foreign taxes paid (or deemed paid, other than by 
reason of section 904(d)) by the old members for the taxable year, and
    (ii) The aggregate unused foreign tax attributable to the old 
members which can be carried to the taxable year arising in taxable 
years ending prior to the particular unused foreign tax year or years.
    (3) Special effective date for CRCO limitation. Paragraphs (g)(1) 
and (2) of this section apply only to a consolidated return change of 
ownership that occurred during a consolidated return year for which the 
due date of the income tax return (without extensions) is on or before 
March 13, 1998. See also Sec. 1.1502-3(d)(4) for an optional effective 
date rule (generally making the rules of paragraph (g)(1) and (2) of 
this section also inapplicable if the consolidated return change of 
ownership occurred on or after January 1, 1997, and during a 
consolidated return year for which the due date of the income tax return 
(without extensions) is on or before March 13, 1998).
    (h) Amount of credit with respect to interest income. If any member 
of the group has interest income described in section 904(f)(2) (for a 
year for which it filed on a consolidated or separate basis), the 
group's foreign tax credit with respect to such interest shall be 
computed separately in accordance with the principles of section 904(f) 
and this section.
    (i) [Reserved]
    (j) Examples. The provisions of this section may be illustrated by 
the following examples:

    Example (1). Domestic corporation P is incorporated on January 1, 
1966. On that same day it also incorporates domestic corporations S and 
T, wholly owned subsidiaries. P, S, and T file consolidated returns for 
1966 and 1967 on the basis of a calendar year. T engages in business 
solely in country A. S transacts business solely in countries A and B. P 
does business solely in the United States. During 1966 T sold an item of 
inventory to P at a profit of $2,000. Under Sec. 1.1502-13 (as 
contained in the 26 CFR part 1 edition revised as of April 1, 1995) such 
profit is deferred and none of the circumstances of restoration 
contained in paragraph (d), (e), or (f) of Sec. 1.1502-13 have occurred 
as of the close of 1966. The taxable income for 1966 from foreign and 
United States sources, and the foreign taxes paid on such foreign income 
are as follows:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Such taxable income was computed by taking into account the rules 
provided in Sec. 1.1502-12. Thus, the $2,000 deferred profit is not 
included in T's taxable income for 1966 (but will be included for the 
taxable year for which one of the events specified in paragraph (d), 
(e), or (f) of Sec. 1.1502-13 occurs). The consolidated taxable income 
of the group (computed in accordance with Sec. 1.1502-11) is $80,000. 
The consolidated tax liability against which the credit may be taken 
(computed in accordance with paragraph (d)(3) of this section) is 
$31,900.

[[Page 254]]

    (i) Assuming P chooses to use the foreign taxes paid as a credit and 
the group is subject to the per-country limitation, the group may take 
as a credit against the consolidated tax liability $11,962.50 of the 
amount paid to country A, plus the $3,000 paid to country B. Such 
amounts are computed as follows: The aggregate taxes paid to country A 
of $18,000 is limited to $11,962.50 ($31,900 times $30,000/$80,000). The 
unused foreign tax with respect to country A is $6,037.50 ($18,000 less 
$11,962.50), and is a consolidated unused foreign tax which shall be 
carried to the years prescribed by section 904(d). A credit of $3,000 is 
available with respect to the taxes paid to country B since such amount 
is less than the limitation of $3,987.50 ($31,900 times $10,000/
$80,000).
    (ii) Assuming the overall limitation is in effect for the taxable 
year, the group may take $15,950 as a credit, computed as follows: The 
aggregate taxes paid to all foreign countries of $21,000 is limited to 
$15,950 ($31,900 times $40,000/$80,000). The unused foreign tax is 
$5,050 ($21,000 less $15,950), and is a consolidated unused foreign tax 
which shall be carried to the years prescribed by section 904(d).
    Example (2). Assume the same facts as in example (1), except that T 
has a $10,000 long-term capital gain (derived from a sale to a nonmember 
in country A) and P has a $10,000 long-term capital loss (derived from a 
sale to a nonmember in the United States). Notwithstanding that the 
consolidated net capital gain (capital gain net income for taxable years 
beginning after December 31, 1976) of the group is zero, T's capital 
gain shall be reflected in full in the computation of taxable income 
from foreign sources.
    Example (3). Assume the same facts as in example (1), except that 
the group had a consolidated section 172 deduction of $8,000 which is 
attributable to a net operating loss sustained by T. The $8,000 
consolidated net operating loss deduction is offset against T's income 
from country A, thus reducing T's taxable income from country A to 
$12,000.

Sec. 1.1502-5  Estimated tax.

    (a) General rule--(1) Consolidated estimated tax. If a group files a 
consolidated return for two consecutive taxable years, it must make 
payments of estimated tax on a consolidated basis for each subsequent 
taxable year, until such time as separate returns are properly filed. 
Until such time, the group is treated as a single corporation for 
purposes of section 6154 (relating to payment of estimated tax by 
corporations). If separate returns are filed by the members for a 
taxable year, the amount of any estimated tax payments made with respect 
to a consolidated payment of estimated tax for such year shall be 
credited against the separate tax liabilities of the members in any 
manner designated by the common parent which is satisfactory to the 
Commissioner. The consolidated payments of estimated tax shall be 
deposited with the authorized financial institution with which the 
common parent deposits its estimated tax payments. A statement should be 
attached to the payment setting forth the name, address, employer 
identification number, and internal revenue service center of each 
member.
    (2) First two consolidated return years. For the first 2 years for 
which a group files a consolidated return, it may make payments of 
estimated tax on either a consolidated or separate basis. If a 
consolidated return is filed for such year, the amount of any estimated 
tax payments made for such year by any member shall be credited against 
the tax liability of the group.
    (3) Effective date. This section applies to taxable years for which 
the due date (without extensions) for filing returns is after August 6, 
1979. For prior taxable years see 26 CFR 1.1502-5 (Revised as of April 
1, 1978).
    (b) Addition to tax for failure to pay estimated tax under section 
6655--(1) Consolidated return filed. For the first two taxable years for 
which a group files a consolidated return, the group may compute the 
amount of the penalty (if any) under section 6655 on a consolidated 
basis or separate member basis, regardless of the method of payment. 
Thereafter, for a taxable year for which the group files a consolidated 
return, the group must compute the penalty on a consolidated basis.
    (2) Computation of penalty on consolidated basis. (i) This paragraph 
(b)(2) gives the rules for computing the penalty under section 6655 on a 
consolidated basis.
    (ii) The tax and facts shown on the return for the preceding taxable 
year referred to in section 6655(d) (1) and (2) are, if a consolidated 
return was filed for that preceding year, such items

[[Page 255]]

shown on the consolidated return for that preceding year or, if one was 
not filed for that preceding year, the aggregate taxes and the facts 
shown on the separate returns of the common parent and any other 
corporation that was a member of the same affiliated group as the common 
parent for that preceding year.
    (iii) If estimated tax was not paid on a consolidated basis, then 
the amount of the group's payments of estimated tax for the taxable year 
is the aggregate of the payments made by all members for the year.
    (iv) Section 6655(d)(1) applies only if the common parent's 
consolidated return, or each member's separate return, for the preceding 
taxable year (as the case may be) was a taxable year of 12 months.
    (3) Computation of penalty on separate member basis. To compute any 
penalty under section 6655 on a separate member basis, for purposes of 
section 6655(b)(1), the ``tax shown on the return for the taxable year'' 
is the portion of the tax shown on the consolidated return allocable to 
the member under paragraph (b)(5) of this section. If the member was 
included in the consolidated return filed by the group for the preceding 
taxable year then:
    (i) For purposes of section 6655(d)(1), the ``tax shown on the 
return'' for any member shall be the portion of the tax shown on the 
consolidated return for the preceding year allocable to the member under 
paragraph (b)(5) of this section.
    (ii) For purposes of section 6655(d)(2), the ``facts shown on the 
return'' shall be the facts shown on the consolidated return for the 
preceding year and the tax computed under that section shall be 
allocated under the rules of paragraph (b)(5) of this section.
    (4) Consolidated payments if separate returns filed. If the group 
does not file a consolidated return for the taxable year, but makes 
payments of estimated tax on a consolidated basis, for purposes of 
section 6655(b)(2), the ``amount, if any of the installment paid'' by 
any member is an amount apportioned to the member in a manner designated 
by the common parent that is satisfactory to the Commissioner. If the 
member was included in the consolidated return filed by the group for 
the preceding taxable year, the amount of a member's penalty under 
section 6655 is computed on the separate member basis described in 
paragraph (b)(3) (i) and (ii) of this section.
    (5) Rules for allocation of consolidated tax liability. For purposes 
of subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph, the tax shown on a 
consolidated return shall be allocated to the members of the group under 
the method which the group has elected pursuant to section 1552 and 
1.1502-33(d)(2).
    (c) Examples. The provisions of this section may be illustrated by 
the following examples:

    Example (1). Corporations P and S-1 file a consolidated return for 
the first time for calendar year 1978. P and S-1 also file consolidated 
returns for 1979 and 1980. For 1978 and 1979, P and S-1 may make 
payments of estimated tax on either a separate or consolidated basis. 
For 1980, however, the group must pay its estimated tax on a 
consolidated basis. In determining whether P and S-1 come within the 
exception provided in section 6655(d)(1) for 1980, the ``tax shown on 
the return'' is the tax shown on the consolidated return for 1979.
    Example (2). Assume the same facts as in example (1). Assume further 
that corporation S-2 was a member of the group during 1979, and joins in 
the filing of the consolidated return for such year but ceases to be a 
member of the group on September 15, 1980. In determining whether the 
group (which no longer includes S-2) comes within the exception provided 
in section 6655(d)(1) for 1980, the ``tax shown on the return'' is the 
tax shown on the consolidated return for 1979.
    Example (3). Assume the same facts as in example (1). Assume further 
that corporation S-2 becomes a member of the group on July 1, 1980, and 
joins in the filing of the consolidated return for 1968. In determining 
whether the group (which now includes S-2) comes within the exception 
provided in section 6655(d)(1) for 1980, the ``tax shown on the return'' 
is the tax shown on the consolidated return for 1979. Any tax of S-2 for 
any separate return year is not included as a part of the ``tax shown on 
the return'' for purposes of applying section 6655(d)(1).
    Example (4). Corporations X and Y filed consolidated returns for the 
calendar years 1977 and 1978 and separate returns for 1979. In 
determining whether X and Y comes within the exception provided in 
section 6655(d)(1) for 1979, the ``tax shown on the return'' is the 
amount of tax shown on the consolidated return for 1978 allocable to X 
and Y in accordance with paragraph (b)(5) of this section.

Sec. 1.1502-6  Liability for tax.

    (a) Several liability of members of group. Except as provided in 
paragraph (b) of this section, the common parent corporation and each 
subsidiary which was a member of the group during any part of the 
consolidated return year shall be severally liable for the tax for such 
year computed in accordance with the regulations under section 1502 
prescribed on or before the due date (not including extensions of time) 
for the filing of the consolidated return for such year.
    (b) Liability of subsidiary after withdrawal. If a subsidiary has 
ceased to be a member of the group and in such cessation resulted from a 
bona fide sale or exchange of its stock for fair value and occurred 
prior to the date upon which any deficiency is assessed, the 
Commissioner may, if he believes that the assessment or collection of 
the balance of the deficiency will not be jeopardized, make assessment 
and collection of such deficiency from such former subsidiary in an 
amount not exceeding the portion of such deficiency which the 
Commissioner may determine to be allocable to it. If the Commissioner 
makes assessment and collection of any part of a deficiency from such 
former subsidiary, then for purposes of any credit or refund of the 
amount collected from such former subsidiary the agency of the common 
parent under the provisions of Sec. 1.1502-77 shall not apply.
    (c) Effect of intercompany agreements. No agreement entered into by 
one or more members of the group with any other member of such group or 
with any other person shall in any case have the effect of reducing the 
liability prescribed under this section.

Sec. 1.1502-9  Consolidated overall foreign losses and separate 
limitation losses.

    (a) In general. This section provides rules for applying section 
904(f) (including its definitions and nomenclature) to a group and its 
members. Generally, section 904(f) concerns rules relating to overall 
foreign losses (OFLs) and separate limitation losses (SLLs) and the 
consequences of such losses. As provided in section 904(f)(5), losses 
are computed separately in each category of income described in section 
904(d)(1) (basket). Paragraph (b) of this section defines terms and 
provides computational and accounting rules, including rules regarding 
recapture. Paragraph (c) of this section provides rules that apply to 
OFLs and SLLs when a member becomes or ceases to be a member of a group. 
Paragraph (d) of this section provides a predecessor and successor rule. 
Paragraph (e) of this section provides effective dates.
    (b) Consolidated application of section 904(f). A group applies 
section 904(f) for a consolidated return year in accordance with that 
section, subject to the following rules:
    (1) Computation of CSLI or CSLL and consolidated U.S. source income 
or loss. The group computes its consolidated separate limitation income 
(CSLI) or consolidated separate limitation loss (CSLL) for each basket 
under the principles of Sec. 1.1502-11 by aggregating each member's 
foreign-source taxable income or loss in such basket computed under the 
principles of Sec. 1.1502-12, and taking into account the foreign 
portion of the consolidated items described in Sec. 1.1502-11(a)(2) 
through (8) for such basket. The group computes its consolidated U.S.-
source taxable income or loss under similar principles.
    (2) Netting CSLLs, CSLIs, and consolidated U.S. source taxable 
income or loss. The group applies section 904(f)(5) to determine the 
extent to which a CSLL for a basket reduces CSLI for another basket or 
consolidated U.S.-source taxable income.
    (3) CSLL and COFL accounts. To the extent provided in section 
904(f), the amount by which a CSLL for a basket (the loss basket) 
reduces CSLI for another basket (the income basket) shall result in the 
creation of (or addition

[[Page 257]]

to) a CSLL account for the loss basket with respect to the income 
basket. Likewise, the amount by which a CSLL for a loss basket reduces 
consolidated U.S.-source income will create (or add to) a consolidated 
overall foreign loss account (a COFL account).
    (4) Recapture of COFL and CSLL accounts. In the case of a COFL 
account for a loss basket, section 904(f)(1) and (3) recharacterizes 
some or all of the foreign-source income in the loss basket as U.S.-
source income. In the case of a CSLL account for a loss basket with 
respect to an income basket, section 904(f)(5)(C) and (F) 
recharacterizes some or all of the foreign-source income in the loss 
basket as foreign-source income in the income basket. The COFL account 
or CSLL account is reduced to the extent amounts are recharacterized 
with respect to such account.
    (5) Intercompany transactions--(i) Nonapplication of section 904(f) 
disposition rules. Neither section 904(f)(3) (in the case of a COFL 
account) nor (5)(F) (in the case of a CSLL account) applies at the time 
of a disposition that is an intercompany transaction to which Sec. 
1.1502-13 applies. Instead, section 904(f)(3) and (5)(F) applies only at 
such time and only to the extent that the group is required under Sec. 
1.1502-13 (without regard to section 904(f)(3) and (5)(F)) to take into 
account any intercompany items resulting from the disposition, based on 
the COFL or CSLL account existing at the end of the consolidated return 
year during which the group takes the intercompany items into account.
    (ii) Example. Paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section is illustrated by 
the following examples. The identity of the parties and the basic 
assumptions set forth in Sec. 1.1502-13(c)(7)(i) apply to the examples. 
Except as otherwise stated, assume further that the consolidated group 
recognizes no foreign-source income other than as a result of the 
transactions described. The examples are as follows:

    Example 1. (i) On June 10, Year 1, S transfers nondepreciable 
property with a basis of $100 and a fair market value of $250 to B in a 
transaction to which section 351 applies. The property was predominantly 
used without the United States in a trade or business, within the 
meaning of section 904(f)(3). B continues to use the property without 
the United States. The group has a COFL account in the relevant loss 
basket of $120 as of December 31, Year 1.
    (ii) Because the contribution from S to B is an intercompany 
transaction, section 904(f)(3) does not apply to result in any gain 
recognition in Year 1. See paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section.
    (iii) On January 10, Year 4, B ceases to be a member of the group. 
Because S did not recognize gain in Year 1 under section 351, no gain is 
taken into account in Year 4 under Sec. 1.1502-13(d). Thus, no portion 
of the group's COFL account is recaptured in Year 4. For rules requiring 
apportionment of a portion of the COFL account to B, see paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section.
    Example 2. (i) The facts are the same as in paragraph (i) of Example 
1. On January 10, Year 4, B sells the property to X for $300. As of 
December 31, Year 4, the group's COFL account is $40. (The COFL account 
was reduced between Year 1 and Year 4 due to unrelated foreign-source 
income taken into account by the group.)
    (ii) B takes into account gain of $200 in Year 4. The $40 COFL 
account in Year 4 recharacterizes $40 of the gain as U.S. source. See 
section 904(f)(3).
    Example 3. (i) On June 10, Year 1, S sells nondepreciable property 
with a basis of $100 and a fair market value of $250 to B for $250 cash. 
The property was predominantly used without the United States in a trade 
or business, within the meaning of section 904(f)(3). The group has a 
COFL account in the relevant loss basket of $120 as of December 31, Year 
1. B predominately uses the property in a trade or business without the 
United States.
    (ii) Because the sale is an intercompany transaction, section 
904(f)(3) does not require the group to take into account any gain in 
Year 1. Thus, under paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section, the COFL 
account is not reduced in Year 1.
    (iii) On January 10, Year 4, B sells the property to X for $300. As 
of December 31, Year 4, the group's COFL account is $60. (The COFL 
account was reduced between Year 1 and Year 4 due to unrelated foreign-
source income taken into account by the group.)
    (iv) In Year 4, S's $150 intercompany gain and B's $50 corresponding 
gain are taken into account to produce the same effect on consolidated 
taxable income as if S and B were divisions of a single corporation. See 
Sec. 1.1502-13(c). All of B's $50 corresponding gain is recharacterized 
under section 904(f)(3). If S and B were divisions of a single 
corporation and the intercompany sale were a transfer between the 
divisions, B would succeed to S's $100 basis in the property and would 
have $200 of gain ($60 of which would be recharacterized under section 
904(f)(3)), instead

[[Page 258]]

of a $50 gain. Consequently, S's $150 intercompany gain and B's $50 
corresponding gain are taken into account, and $10 of S's gain is 
recharacterized under section 904(f)(3) as U.S. source to reflect the 
$10 difference between B's $50 recharacterized gain and the $60 
recomputed gain that would have been recharacterized.

    (c) Becoming or ceasing to be a member of a group--(1) Adding 
separate accounts on becoming a member. At the time that a corporation 
becomes a member of a group (a new member), the group adds to the 
balance of its COFL or CSLL account the balance of the new member's 
corresponding OFL account or SLL account. A new member's OFL account 
corresponds to a COFL account if the account is for the same loss 
basket. A new member's SLL account corresponds to a CSLL account if the 
account is for the same loss basket and with respect to the same income 
basket. If the group does not have a COFL or CSLL account corresponding 
to the new member's account, it creates a COFL or CSLL account with a 
balance equal to the balance of the member's account.
    (2) Apportionment of consolidated account to departing member--(i) 
In general. A group apportions to a member that ceases to be a member (a 
departing member) a portion of each COFL and CSLL account as of the end 
of the year during which the member ceases to be a member and after the 
group makes the additions or reductions to such account required under 
paragraphs (b)(3), (b)(4) and (c)(1) of this section (other than an 
addition under paragraph (c)(1) of this section attributable to a member 
becoming a member after the departing member ceases to be a member). The 
group computes such portion under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, 
as limited by paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section. The departing 
member carries such portion to its first separate return year after it 
ceases to be a member. Also, the group reduces each account by such 
portion and carries such reduced amount to its first consolidated return 
year beginning after the year in which the member ceases to be a member. 
If two or more members cease to be members in the same year, the group 
computes the portion allocable to each such member (and reduces its 
accounts by such portion) in the order that the members cease to be 
members.
    (ii) Departing member's portion of group's account. A departing 
member's portion of a group's COFL or CSLL account for a loss basket is 
computed based upon the member's share of the group's assets that 
generate income subject to recapture at the time that the member ceases 
to be a member. Under the characterization principles of Sec. Sec. 
1.861-9T(g)(3) and 1.861-12T, the group identifies the assets of the 
departing member and the remaining members that generate foreign-source 
income (foreign assets) in each basket. The assets are characterized 
based upon the income that the assets are reasonably expected to 
generate after the member ceases to be a member. The member's portion of 
a group's COFL or CSLL account for a loss basket is the group's COFL or 
CSLL account, respectively, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of 
which is the value of the member's foreign assets for the loss basket 
and the denominator of which is the value of the foreign assets of the 
group (including the departing member) for the loss basket. The value of 
the foreign assets is determined under the asset valuation rules of 
Sec. 1.861-9T(g)(1) and (2) using either tax book value or fair market 
value under the method chosen by the group for purposes of interest 
apportionment as provided in Sec. 1.861-9T(g)(1)(ii). For purposes of 
this paragraph (c)(2)(ii), Sec. 1.861-9T(g)(2)(iv) (assets in 
intercompany transactions) shall apply, but Sec. 1.861-9T(g)(2)(iii) 
(adjustments for directly allocated interest) shall not apply. If the 
group uses the tax book value method, the member's portions of COFL and 
CSLL accounts are limited by paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section. In 
addition, for purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(ii), the tax book value 
of assets transferred in intercompany transactions shall be determined 
without regard to previously deferred gain or loss that is taken into 
account by the group as a result of the transaction in which the member 
ceases to be a member. The assets should be valued at the time the 
member ceases to be a member, but values on other dates may be used 
unless this creates substantial distortions. For example, if a member

[[Page 259]]

ceases to be a member in the middle of the group's consolidated return 
year, an average of the values of assets at the beginning and end of the 
year (as provided in Sec. 1.861-9T(g)(2)) may be used or, if a member 
ceases to be a member in the early part of the group's consolidated 
return year, values at the beginning of the year may be used, unless 
this creates substantial distortions.
    (iii) Limitation on member's portion for groups using tax book value 
method. If a group uses the tax book value method of valuing assets for 
purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section and the aggregate of a 
member's portions of COFL and CSLL accounts for a loss basket (with 
respect to one or more income baskets) determined under paragraph 
(c)(2)(ii) of this section exceeds 150 percent of the actual fair market 
value of the member's foreign assets in the loss basket, the member's 
portion of the COFL or CSLL accounts for the loss basket shall be 
reduced (proportionately, in the case of multiple accounts) by such 
excess. This rule does not apply if the departing member and all other 
members that cease to be members as part of the same transaction own all 
(or substantially all) the foreign assets in the loss basket.
    (iv) Determination of values of foreign assets binding on departing 
member. The group's determination of the value of the member's and the 
group's foreign assets for a loss basket is binding on the member, 
unless the Commissioner concludes that the determination is not 
appropriate. The common parent of the group must attach a statement to 
the return for the taxable year that the departing member ceases to be a 
member of the group that sets forth the name and taxpayer identification 
number of the departing member, the amount of each COFL or CSLL for each 
loss basket that is apportioned to the departing member under this 
paragraph (c)(2), the method used to determine the value of the member's 
and the group's foreign assets in each such loss basket, and the value 
of the member's and the group's foreign assets in each such loss basket. 
The common parent must also furnish a copy of the statement to the 
departing member.
    (v) Anti-abuse rule. If a corporation becomes a member and ceases to 
be a member, and a principal purpose of the corporation becoming and 
ceasing to be a member is to transfer the corporation's OFL account or 
SLL account to the group or to transfer the group's COFL or CSLL account 
to the corporation, appropriate adjustments will be made to eliminate 
the benefit of such a transfer of accounts. Similarly, if any member 
acquires assets or disposes of assets (including a transfer of assets 
between members of the group and the departing member) with a principal 
purpose of affecting the apportionment of accounts under paragraph 
(c)(2)(i) of this section, appropriate adjustments will be made to 
eliminate the benefit of such acquisition or disposition.
    (vi) Examples. The following examples illustrate this paragraph (c):

    Example 1. (i) On November 6, Year 1, S, a member of the P group, a 
consolidated group with a calendar consolidated return year, ceases to 
be a member of the group. On December 31, Year 1, the P group has a $40 
COFL account for the general limitation basket, a $20 CSLL account for 
the general limitation basket (i.e., the loss basket) with respect to 
the passive basket (i.e., the income basket), and a $10 CSLL account for 
the shipping income basket (i.e., the loss basket) with respect to the 
passive basket (i.e., the income basket). No member of the group has 
foreign-source income or loss in Year 1. The group apportions its 
interest expense according to the tax book value method.
    (ii) On November 6, Year 1, the group identifies S's assets and its 
own assets (including S's assets) expected to produce foreign general 
limitation income. Use of end-of-the-year values will not create 
substantial distortions in determining the relative values of S's and 
the group's relevant assets on November 6, Year 1. The group determines 
that S's relevant assets have a tax book value of $2,000 and a fair 
market value of $2,200. Also, the group's relevant assets (including S's 
assets) have a tax book value of $8,000. On November 6, Year 1, S has no 
assets expected to produce foreign shipping income.
    (iii) Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, S takes a $10 COFL 
account for the general limitation basket ($40 x $2000/$8000) and a $5 
CSLL account for the general limitation basket with respect to the 
passive basket ($20 x $2000/$8000). S does not take any portion of the 
shipping income basket CSLL account. The limitation described in 
paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section does not apply because the 
aggregate of the COFL and CSLL accounts for the general limitation 
basket that are apportioned to S ($15) is less than 150 percent of the 
actual fair market value of

[[Page 260]]

S's general limitation foreign assets ($2,200 x 150%).

    Example 2. (i) Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except that 
the fair market value of S's general limitation foreign assets is $4 as 
of November 6, Year 1.

    (ii) Under paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section, S's COFL and CSLL 
accounts for the general limitation basket must be reduced by $9, which 
is the excess of $15 (the aggregate amount of the accounts apportioned 
under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section) over $6 (150 percent of the 
$4 actual fair market value of S's general limitation foreign assets). S 
thus takes a $4 COFL account for the general limitation basket ($10-($9 
x $10/$15)) and a $2 CSLL account for the general limitation basket with 
respect to the passive basket ($5-($9 x $5/$15)).

    (d) Predecessor and successor. A reference to a member includes, as 
the context may require, a reference to a predecessor or successor of 
the member. See Sec. 1.1502-1(f).

    (e) Effective dates. This section applies to consolidated return 
years for which the due date of the income tax return (without 
extensions) is after August 11, 1999. However, paragraph (b)(5) of this 
section (intercompany transactions) is not applicable for intercompany 
transactions that occur before January 28, 1999. A group applies the 
principles of Sec. 1.1502-9A(e) to a disposition which is an 
intercompany transaction to which Sec. 1.1502-13 applies and that 
occurs before January 28, 1999. Also, paragraph (c)(2) of this section 
(apportionment of consolidated account to departing member) is not 
applicable for members ceasing to be members of a group before January 
28, 1999. A group applies the principles of Sec. 1.1502-9A (rather than 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section) to determine the amount of a 
consolidated account that is apportioned to a member that ceases to be a 
member of the group before January 28, 1999 (and reduces its 
consolidated account by such apportioned amount) before applying 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section to members that cease to be members on 
or after January 28, 1999.


[T.D. 8833, 64 FR 43616, Aug. 11, 1999]

               Computation of Consolidated Taxable Income


<R05>
Sec. 1.1502-11  Consolidated taxable income.

    (a) In general. The consolidated taxable income for a consolidated 
return year shall be determined by taking into account:
    (1) The separate taxable income of each member of the group (see 
Sec. 1.1502-12 for the computation of separate taxable income);
    (2) Any consolidated net operating loss deduction (see Sec. Sec. 
1.1502-21 (or 1.1502-21A, as appropriate) for the computation of the 
consolidated net operating loss deduction);
    (3) Any consolidated capital gain net income (net capital gain for 
taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) (see Sec. Sec. 1.1502-
22 (or 1.1502-22A, as appropriate) for the computation of the 
consolidated capital gain net income (net capital gain for taxable years 
beginning before January 1, 1977));
    (4) Any consolidated section 1231 net loss (see Sec. Sec. 1.1502-
23 (or 1.1502-23A, as appropriate) for the computation of the 
consolidated section 1231 net loss);
    (5) Any consolidated charitable contributions deduction (see Sec. 
1.1502-24 for the computation of the consolidated charitable 
contributions deduction);
    (6) Any consolidated section 922 deduction (see Sec. 1.1502-25 for 
the computation of the consolidated section 922 deduction);
    (7) Any consolidated dividends received deduction (see Sec. 1.1502-
26 for the computation of the consolidated dividends received 
deduction); and
    (8) Any consolidated section 247 deduction (see Sec. 1.1502-27 for 
the computation of the consolidated section 247 deduction).
    (b) Elimination of circular stock basis adjustments--(1) In general. 
If one member (P) disposes of the stock of another member (S), this 
paragraph (b) limits the use of S's deductions and losses in the year of 
disposition and the carryback of items to prior years. The purpose of 
the limitation is to prevent P's income or gain from the disposition of 
S's stock from increasing the absorption of S's deductions and losses, 
because the increased absorption would reduce P's basis (or increase its 
excess

[[Page 261]]

loss account) in S's stock under Sec. 1.1502-32 and, in turn, increase 
P's income or gain. See paragraph (b)(3) of this section for the 
application of these principles to P's deduction or loss from the 
disposition of S's stock, and paragraph (b)(4) of this section for the 
application of these principles to multiple stock dispositions. See 
Sec. 1.1502-19(c) for the definition of disposition.
    (2) Limitation on deductions and losses--(i) Determination of amount 
of limitation. If P disposes of one or more shares of S's stock, the 
extent to which S's deductions and losses for the tax year of the 
disposition (and its deductions and losses carried over from prior 
years) may offset income and gain is subject to limitation. The amount 
of S's deductions and losses that may offset income and gain is 
determined by tentatively computing taxable income (or loss) for the 
year of disposition (and any prior years to which the deductions or 
losses may be carried) without taking into account P's income and gain 
from the disposition.
    (ii) Application of limitation. S's deductions and losses offset 
income and gain only to the extent of the amount determined under 
paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. To the extent S's deductions and 
losses in the year of disposition cannot offset income or gain because 
of the limitation under this paragraph (b), the items are carried to 
other years under the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code 
and regulations as if they were the only items incurred by S in the year 
of disposition. For example, to the extent S incurs an operating loss in 
the year of disposition that is limited, the loss is treated as a 
separate net operating loss attributable to S arising in that year. The 
tentative computation does not affect the manner in which S's unlimited 
deductions and losses are absorbed or the manner in which deductions and 
losses of other members are absorbed. (If the amount of S's unlimited 
deductions and losses actually absorbed is less than the amount absorbed 
in the tentative computation, P's stock basis adjustments under Sec. 
1.1502-32 reflect only the amounts actually absorbed.)
    (iii) Examples. For purposes of the examples in this paragraph (b), 
unless otherwise stated, P owns all of the only class of S's stock for 
the entire year, S owns no stock of lower-tier members, the tax year of 
all persons is the calendar year, all persons use the accrual method of 
accounting, the facts set forth the only corporate activity, all 
transactions are between unrelated persons, and tax liabilities are 
disregarded. The principles of this paragraph (b)(2) are illustrated by 
the following examples.

    Example 1. Limitation on losses with respect to stock gain. (a) P 
has a $500 basis in S's stock. For Year 1, P has ordinary income of $30 
(determined without taking P's gain or loss from the disposition of S's 
stock into account) and S has an $80 ordinary loss. P sells S's stock 
for $520 at the close of Year 1.
    (b) To determine the amount of the limitation on S's loss under 
paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, and the effect under Sec. 1.1502-
32(b) of the absorption of S's loss on P's basis in S's stock, P's gain 
or loss from the disposition of S's stock is not taken into account. The 
group is tentatively treated as having a consolidated net operating loss 
of $50 (P's $30 of income minus S's $80 loss). Thus, $50 of S's loss is 
limited under this paragraph (b).
    (c) Because $30 of S's loss is absorbed in the determination of 
consolidated taxable income under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, 
P's basis in S's stock is reduced under Sec. 1.1502-32(b) from $500 to 
$470 immediately before the disposition. Consequently, P recognizes a 
$50 gain from the sale of S's stock and the group has consolidated 
taxable income of $50 for Year 1 (P's $30 of ordinary income and $50 
gain from the sale of S's stock, less the $30 of S's loss). In addition, 
S's limited loss of $50 is treated as a separate net operating loss 
attributable to S and, because S ceases to be a member, the loss is 
apportioned to S under Sec. 1.1502-21 (or Sec. 1.1502-79A, as 
appropriate) and carried to its first separate return year.
    Example 2. Carrybacks and carryovers. (a) For Year 1, the P group 
has consolidated taxable income of $30, and a consolidated net capital 
loss of $100 ($50 attributable to P and $50 to S). At the beginning of 
Year 2, P has a $300 basis in S's stock. For Year 2, P has ordinary 
income of $30, and a $20 capital gain (determined without taking the 
$100 consolidated net capital loss carryover or P's gain or loss from 
the disposition of S's stock into account), and S has a $100 ordinary 
loss. P sells S's stock for $280 at the close of Year 2.
    (b) To determine the amount of the limitation under paragraph 
(b)(2)(i) of this section on S's losses, and the effect of the 
absorption of S's losses on P's basis in S's stock under Sec. 1.1502-
32(b), P's gain or loss from the disposition of S's stock is not taken 
into account. For Year 2, the P group is tentatively

[[Page 262]]

treated as having a $70 consolidated net operating loss (S's $100 
ordinary loss, less P's $30 of ordinary income). The P group is also 
treated as having no consolidated net capital gain in Year 2, because 
P's $20 capital gain is reduced by $20 of the consolidated net capital 
loss carryover from Year 1 under section 1212(a) (the absorption of 
which is attributed equally to P and S). In addition, of the $70 
consolidated net operating loss, $30 is carried back to Year 1 and 
offsets P's ordinary income in that year, and $40 is carried forward. 
Consequently, $40 of S's operating loss from Year 2, and $40 of the 
consolidated net capital loss carryover from Year 1 attributable to S, 
are limited under this paragraph (b).
    (c) Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the limitation under 
this paragraph (b) does not affect the absorption of any deductions and 
losses attributable to P, $60 of S's operating loss from Year 2, and $10 
of the consolidated net capital loss from Year 1 attributable to S. 
Consequently, P's basis in S's stock is reduced under Sec. 1.1502-32(b) 
by $70, from $300 to $230, and P recognizes a $50 gain from the sale of 
S's stock in Year 2. Thus, the P group is treated as having a $20 
unlimited net operating loss that is carried back to Year 1:

Ordinary income:
  P...........................................................      $30
  S (excluding the $40 limited loss)..........................      (60)
                                                               ---------
    Sub Total.................................................     $(30)
Consolidated net capital gain:
  P ($20 + $50 from S stock - $50 from Year 1)................      $20
  S (-$10 from Year 1)........................................      (10)
                                                               ---------
    Sub Total.................................................      $10
Consolidated taxable income...................................     $(20)
 

    (d) Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, S's $40 ordinary 
loss from Year 2 that is limited under this paragraph (b) is treated as 
a separate net operating loss arising in Year 2. Similarly, $40 of the 
consolidated net capital loss from Year 1 attributable to S is treated 
as a separate net capital loss carried over from Year 1. Because S 
ceases to be a member, the $40 net operating loss from Year 2 and the 
$40 consolidated net capital loss from Year 1 are allocated to S under 
Sec. Sec. 1.1502-21 and 1.1502-22, respectively (or Sec. 1.1502-79A, 
as appropriate) and are carried to S's first separate return year.
    Example 3. Allocation of basis adjustments. (a) For Year 1, the P 
group has consolidated taxable income of $100. At the beginning of Year 
2, P has a $40 basis in each of the 10 shares of S's stock. For Year 2, 
P has an $80 ordinary loss (determined without taking into account P's 
gain or loss from the disposition of S's stock) and S has an $80 
ordinary loss. P sells 2 shares of S's stock for $85 each at the close 
of Year 2.
    (b) Under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the amount of the 
limitation on S's loss is determined by tentatively treating the P group 
as having a $160 consolidated net operating loss for Year 2. Of this 
amount, $100 is carried back under section 172 and absorbed in Year 1 
($50 attributable to S and $50 attributable to P). Consequently, $30 of 
S's loss is limited under this paragraph (b).
    (c) Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the limitation under 
this paragraph (b) does not affect the absorption of P's $80 ordinary 
loss or $50 of S's ordinary loss. Consequently, P's basis in each share 
of S's stock is reduced from $40 to $35 under Sec. 1.1502-32(b), and P 
recognizes a $100 gain from the sale of the 2 shares. Thus, the P group 
is treated as having a $30 unlimited net operating loss:

Ordinary loss:
  P...........................................................    $ (80)
  S (excluding the $30 limited loss)..........................      (50)
                                                               ---------
    Sub Total.................................................    $(130)
Consolidated net capital gain:
  P...........................................................     $100
  S...........................................................        0
                                                               ---------
    Sub Total.................................................     $100
Unlimited consolidated net operating loss.....................     $(30)
 

    (d) A portion of the $130 of unlimited operating losses for Year 2 
is fully absorbed in that year, and a portion is carried back to Year 1. 
Thus, $61.50 of P's $80 loss ($100 multiplied by $80/$130) and $38.50 of 
S's $50 unlimited loss ($100 multiplied by $50/$130) are absorbed in 
Year 2. P's remaining $18.50 of loss and S's remaining $11.50 of loss 
are not subject to limitation and are carried back and absorbed in Year 
1.
    (e) Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, S's $30 of loss 
limited under this paragraph (b) is treated as a separate net operating 
loss.

    (3) Loss dispositions--(i) General rule. The principles of paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section apply to the extent necessary to carry out the 
purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section if P recognizes a deduction 
or loss from the disposition of S's stock.
    (ii) Example. The principles of this paragraph (b)(3) are 
illustrated by the following example.

    Example. (a) P has a $400 basis in S's stock. For Year 1, P has a 
capital gain of $100 (determined without taking P's gain or loss from 
the disposition of S's stock into account) and S has both a $60 capital 
loss and a $200 ordinary loss. P sells S's stock for $140 at the close 
of Year 1.
    (b) Under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the amount of S's 
ordinary and capital losses

[[Page 263]]

that may offset income and gain is determined by tentatively computing 
the group's consolidated net operating loss and consolidated net capital 
loss without taking into account P's loss from the disposition of S's 
stock. The limitation is necessary to prevent P's loss from the 
disposition of S's stock from affecting the absorption of S's losses and 
thereby the adjustments to P's basis in S's stock under Sec. 1.1502-
32(b) (which would, in turn, affect P's loss).
    (c) Under the principles of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the 
amount of the limitation on S's loss is determined by tentatively 
treating the P group as having a $40 consolidated net capital gain and a 
$200 ordinary loss, which results in a $160 consolidated net operating 
loss for Year 1, all of which is attributable to S. Thus, $160 of S's 
ordinary loss is limited under this paragraph (b). See also Sec. Sec. 
1.337(d)-2T and 1.1502-35T for rules relating to basis adjustments and 
allowance of stock loss on dispositions of stock of a subsidiary member.

    (4) Multiple dispositions--(i) Stock of a member. To the extent 
income, gain, deduction, or loss from a prior disposition of S's stock 
is deferred under any rule of law, the limitation under paragraph (b)(2) 
of this section is determined by treating the year the deferred amount 
is taken into account as the year of the disposition.
    (ii) Stock of different members. If S is a higher-tier corporation 
with respect to another member (T), and all of T's items of income, 
gain, deduction, and loss (including the absorption of T's deduction or 
loss) would be fully reflected in P's basis in S's stock under Sec. 
1.1502-32, the limitation under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section with 
respect to T's deductions and losses is determined without taking into 
account any income, gain, deduction, or loss from the disposition of the 
stock of S or T (or of the stock of members owned in the chain 
connecting S and T). However, this paragraph (b) does not otherwise 
limit the absorption of one member's deduction or loss with respect to 
the disposition of another member's stock.
    (iii) Examples. The principles of this paragraph (b)(4) are 
illustrated by the following examples.

    Example 1. Chain of subsidiaries. (a) P owns all of S's stock with a 
$500 basis, and S owns all of T's stock with a $500 basis. For Year 1, P 
has ordinary income of $30, S has no income or loss, and T has an $80 
ordinary loss. P sells S's stock for $520 at the close of Year 1.
    (b) Under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, to determine the amount 
of the limitation under paragraph (b) of this section on T's loss, and 
the effect of the absorption of T's loss on P's basis in S's stock under 
Sec. 1.1502-32(b), P's gain or loss from the disposition of S's stock 
is not taken into account. The group is tentatively treated as having a 
consolidated net operating loss of $50 (P's $30 of income minus T's $80 
loss). Because only $30 of T's loss offsets income or gain, P's basis in 
S's stock is reduced under Sec. 1.1502-32(b) from $500 to $470 
immediately before the disposition of S's stock. Thus, P takes into 
account a $50 gain from the sale of S's stock.
    (c) The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this Example 1, 
except that S has a $10 excess loss account in T's stock (rather than a 
$500 basis). Under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, neither P's gain or 
loss from the disposition of S's stock nor S's gain or loss from the 
disposition of T's stock (under Sec. 1.1502-19) are taken into account 
for purposes of the tentative computations and the effect of any 
absorption under Sec. 1.1502-32(b) on P's basis in S's stock and S's 
excess loss account in T's stock. The group is tentatively treated as 
having a consolidated net operating loss of $50 (P's $30 of income minus 
T's $80 loss), and only $30 of T's loss may offset the group's income or 
gain. Under Sec. 1.1502-32(b), the absorption of $30 of T's loss 
increases S's excess loss account in T's stock to $40 and, under Sec. 
1.1502-19, the excess loss account is taken into account. Moreover, 
under Sec. 1.1502-32(b), P's basis in S's stock is increased 
immediately before the sale by $10 (S's $40 gain under Sec. 1.1502-
19(b) minus T's $30 loss absorbed and tiered up under Sec. 1.1502-
32(b)), from $500 to $510. Thus, P takes into account a $10 gain from 
the sale of S's stock, and S takes into account a $40 gain from its 
excess loss account in T's stock.
    Example 2. Brother-sister subsidiaries. (a) P owns all of the stock 
of S1 and S2, each with a $50 basis. For Year 1, the group has a $100 
consolidated net operating loss ($50 of which is attributable to S1, and 
$50 to S2) determined without taking gain or loss from the disposition 
of member stock into account. At the close of Year 1, P sells the stock 
of S1 and S2 for $100 each.
    (b) Paragraph (b)(4) of this section does not limit the loss of S1 
or S2 with respect to the disposition of stock of the other. 
Consequently, each subsidiary's loss may offset P's gain from the 
disposition of the stock of the other subsidiary. Because this 
absorption results in a $50 reduction in P's basis in the stock of each 
subsidiary under Sec. 1.1502-32(b), P's aggregate gain from the stock 
dispositions is increased from $100 to $200, $100 of which is offset by 
the losses of the subsidiaries.


[[Page 264]]


    (5) Effective date. This paragraph (b) applies to stock dispositions 
occurring in consolidated return years beginning on or after January 1, 
1995. For prior years, see Sec. 1.1502-11(b) as contained in the 26 CFR 
part 1 edition revised as of April 1, 1994.
    (c) Disallowance of loss attributable to pre-1966 distributions. No 
loss shall be allowed upon the sale or other disposition of stock, 
bonds, or other obligations of a member or former member to the extent 
that such loss is attributable to a distribution made in an affiliated 
year beginning before January 1, 1966, out of earnings and profits 
accumulated before the distributing corporation became a member.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1502-13  Intercompany transactions.

    (a) In general--(1) Purpose. This section provides rules for taking 
into account items of income, gain, deduction, and loss of members from 
intercompany transactions. The purpose of this section is to provide 
rules to clearly reflect the taxable income (and tax liability) of the 
group as a whole by preventing intercompany transactions from creating, 
accelerating, avoiding, or deferring consolidated taxable income (or 
consolidated tax liability).
    (2) Separate entity and single entity treatment. Under this section, 
the selling member (S) and the buying member (B) are treated as separate 
entities for some purposes but as divisions of a single corporation for 
other purposes. The amount and location of S's intercompany items and 
B's corresponding items are determined on a separate entity basis 
(separate entity treatment). For example, S determines its gain or loss 
from a sale of property to B on a separate entity basis, and B has a 
cost basis in the property. The timing, and the character, source, and 
other attributes of the intercompany items and corresponding items, 
although initially determined on a separate entity basis, are 
redetermined under this section to produce the effect of transactions 
between divisions of a single corporation (single entity treatment). For 
example, if S sells land to B at a gain and B sells the land to a 
nonmember, S does not take its gain into account until B's sale to the 
nonmember.
    (3) Timing rules as a method of accounting--(i) In general. The 
timing rules of this section are a method of accounting for intercompany 
transactions, to be applied by each member in addition to the member's 
other methods of accounting. See Sec. 1.1502-17 and, with regard to 
consolidated return years beginning on or after November 7, 2001, Sec. 
1.446-1(c)(2)(iii). To the extent the timing rules of this section are 
inconsistent with a member's otherwise applicable methods of accounting, 
the timing rules of this section control. For example, if S sells 
property to B in exchange for B's note, the timing rules of this section 
apply instead of the installment sale rules of section 453. S's or B's 
application of the timing rules of this section to an intercompany 
transaction clearly reflects income only if the effect of that 
transaction as a whole (including, for example, related costs and 
expenses) on consolidated taxable income is clearly reflected.
    (ii) Automatic consent for joining and departing members--(A) 
Consent granted. Section 446(e) consent is granted under this section to 
the extent a change in method of accounting is necessary solely by 
reason of the timing rules of this section--
    (1) For each member, with respect to its intercompany transactions, 
in the first consolidated return year which follows a separate return 
year and in which the member engages in an intercompany transaction; and
    (2) For each former member, with respect to its transactions with 
members that would otherwise be intercompany transactions if the former 
member were still a member, in the first separate return year in which 
the former member engages in such a transaction.
    (B) Cut-off basis. Any change in method of accounting described in 
paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(A) of this section is to be effected on a cut-off 
basis for transactions entered into on or after the first day of the 
year for which consent is granted under paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(A) of this 
section.
    (4) Other law. The rules of this section apply in addition to other 
applicable law (including nonstatutory authorities). For example, this 
section applies in addition to sections 267(f) (additional rules for 
certain losses), 269 (acquisitions to evade or avoid income tax), and 
482 (allocations among commonly controlled taxpayers). Thus, an item 
taken into account under this section can be deferred, disallowed, or

[[Page 266]]

eliminated under other applicable law, for example, section 1091 (losses 
from wash sales).
    (5) References. References in other sections to this section 
include, as appropriate, references to prior law. For effective dates 
and prior law see paragraph (l) of this section.
    (6) Overview--(i) In general. The principal rules of this section 
that implement single entity treatment are the matching rule and the 
acceleration rule of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. Under the 
matching rule, S and B are generally treated as divisions of a single 
corporation for purposes of taking into account their items from 
intercompany transactions. The acceleration rule provides additional 
rules for taking the items into account if the effect of treating S and 
B as divisions cannot be achieved (for example, if S or B becomes a 
nonmember). Paragraph (b) of this section provides definitions. 
Paragraph (e) of this section provides simplifying rules for certain 
transactions. Paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section provide additional 
rules for stock and obligations of members. Paragraphs (h) and (j) of 
this section provide anti-avoidance rules and miscellaneous operating 
rules.

    (b) Definitions. For purposes of this section--

[[Page 267]]

    (1) Intercompany transactions--(i) In general. An intercompany 
transaction is a transaction between corporations that are members of 
the same consolidated group immediately after the transaction. S is the 
member transferring property or providing services, and B is the member 
receiving the property or services. Intercompany transactions include--
    (A) S's sale of property (or other transfer, such as an exchange or 
contribution) to B, whether or not gain or loss is recognized;
    (B) S's performance of services for B, and B's payment or accrual of 
its expenditure for S's performance;
    (C) S's licensing of technology, rental of property, or loan of 
money to B, and B's payment or accrual of its expenditure; and
    (D) S's distribution to B with respect to S stock.
    (ii) Time of transaction. If a transaction occurs in part while S 
and B are members and in part while they are not members, the 
transaction is treated as occurring when performance by either S or B 
takes place, or when payment for performance would be taken into account 
under the rules of this section if it were an intercompany transaction, 
whichever is earliest. Appropriate adjustments must be made in such 
cases by, for example, dividing the transaction into two separate 
transactions reflecting the extent to which S or B has performed.
    (iii) Separate transactions. Except as otherwise provided in this 
section, each transaction is analyzed separately. For example, if S 
simultaneously sells two properties to B, one at a gain and the other at 
a loss, each property is treated as sold in a separate transaction. 
Thus, the gain and loss cannot be offset or netted against each other 
for purposes of this section. Similarly, each payment or accrual of 
interest on a loan is a separate transaction. In addition, an accrual of 
premium is treated as a separate transaction, or as an offset to 
interest that is not a separate transaction, to the extent required 
under separate entity treatment. If two members exchange property, each 
member is S with respect to the property it transfers and B with respect 
to the property it receives. If two members enter into a notional 
principal contract, each payment under the contract is a separate 
transaction and the member making the payment is B with respect to that 
payment and the member receiving the payment is S. See paragraph (j)(4) 
of this section for rules aggregating certain transactions.
    (2) Intercompany items--(i) In general. S's income, gain, deduction, 
and loss from an intercompany transaction are its intercompany items. 
For example, S's gain from the sale of property to B is intercompany 
gain. An item is an intercompany item whether it is directly or 
indirectly from an intercompany transaction.
    (ii) Related costs or expenses. S's costs or expenses related to an 
intercompany transaction are included in determining its intercompany 
items. For example, if S sells inventory to B, S's direct and indirect 
costs properly includible under section 263A are included in determining 
its intercompany income. Similarly, related costs or expenses that are 
not capitalized under S's separate entity method of accounting are 
included in determining its intercompany items. For example, deductions 
for employee wages, in addition to other related costs, are included in 
determining S's intercompany items from performing services for B, and 
depreciation deductions are included in determining S's intercompany 
items from renting property to B.
    (iii) Amounts not yet recognized or incurred. S's intercompany items 
include amounts from an intercompany transaction that are not yet taken 
into account under its separate entity method of accounting. For 
example, if S is a cash method taxpayer, S's intercompany income might 
be taken into account under this section even if the cash is not yet 
received. Similarly, an amount reflected in basis (or an amount 
equivalent to basis) under S's separate entity method of accounting that 
is a substitute for income, gain, deduction or loss from an intercompany 
transaction is an intercompany item.
    (3) Corresponding items--(i) In general. B's income, gain, 
deduction, and loss from an intercompany transaction, or from property 
acquired in an intercompany transaction, are its corresponding

[[Page 268]]

items. For example, if B pays rent to S, B's deduction for the rent is a 
corresponding deduction. If B buys property from S and sells it to a 
nonmember, B's gain or loss from the sale to the nonmember is a 
corresponding gain or loss; alternatively, if B recovers the cost of the 
property through depreciation, B's depreciation deductions are 
corresponding deductions. An item is a corresponding item whether it is 
directly or indirectly from an intercompany transaction (or from 
property acquired in an intercompany transaction).
    (ii) Disallowed or eliminated amounts. B's corresponding items 
include amounts that are permanently disallowed or permanently 
eliminated, whether directly or indirectly. Thus, corresponding items 
include amounts disallowed under section 265 (expenses relating to tax-
exempt income), and amounts not recognized under section 311(a) 
(nonrecognition of loss on distributions), section 332 (nonrecognition 
on liquidating distributions), or section 355(c) (certain distributions 
of stock of a subsidiary). On the other hand, an amount is not 
permanently disallowed or permanently eliminated (and therefore is not a 
corresponding item) to the extent it is not recognized in a transaction 
in which B receives a successor asset within the meaning of paragraph 
(j)(1) of this section. For example, B's corresponding items do not 
include amounts not recognized from a transaction with a nonmember to 
which section 1031 applies or from another transaction in which B 
receives exchanged basis property.
    (4) Recomputed corresponding items. The recomputed corresponding 
item is the corresponding item that B would take into account if S and B 
were divisions of a single corporation and the intercompany transaction 
were between those divisions. For example, if S sells property with a 
$70 basis to B for $100, and B later sells the property to a nonmember 
for $90, B's corresponding item is its $10 loss, and the recomputed 
corresponding item is $20 of gain (determined by comparing the $90 sales 
price with the $70 basis the property would have if S and B were 
divisions of a single corporation). Although neither S nor B actually 
takes the recomputed corresponding item into account, it is computed as 
if B did take it into account (based on reasonable and consistently 
applied assumptions, including any provision of the Internal Revenue 
Code or regulations that would affect its timing or attributes).
    (5) Treatment as a separate entity. Treatment as a separate entity 
means treatment without application of the rules of this section, but 
with the application of the other consolidated return regulations. For 
example, if S sells the stock of another member to B, S's gain or loss 
on a separate entity basis is determined with the application of Sec. 
1.1502-80(b) (non-applicability of section 304), but without 
redetermination under paragraph (c) or (d) of this section.
    (6) Attributes. The attributes of an intercompany item or 
corresponding item are all of the item's characteristics, except amount, 
location, and timing, necessary to determine the item's effect on 
taxable income (and tax liability). For example, attributes include 
character, source, treatment as excluded from gross income or as a 
noncapital, nondeductible amount, and treatment as built-in gain or loss 
under section 382(h) or 384. In contrast, the characteristics of 
property, such as a member's holding period, or the fact that property 
is included in inventory, are not attributes of an item, but these 
characteristics might affect the determination of the attributes of 
items from the property.
    (c) Matching rule. For each consolidated return year, B's 
corresponding items and S's intercompany items are taken into account 
under the following rules:
    (1) Attributes and holding periods--(i) Attributes. The separate 
entity attributes of S's intercompany items and B's corresponding items 
are redetermined to the extent necessary to produce the same effect on 
consolidated taxable income (and consolidated tax liability) as if S and 
B were divisions of a single corporation, and the intercompany 
transaction were a transaction between divisions. Thus, the activities 
of both S and B might affect the attributes of both intercompany items 
and corresponding items.

[[Page 269]]

For example, if S holds property for sale to unrelated customers in the 
ordinary course of its trade or business, S sells the property to B at a 
gain and B sells the property to an unrelated person at a further gain, 
S's intercompany gain and B's corresponding gain might be ordinary 
because of S's activities with respect to the property. Similar 
principles apply if S performs services, rents property, or engages in 
any other intercompany transaction.
    (ii) Holding periods. The holding period of property transferred in 
an intercompany transaction is the aggregate of the holding periods of S 
and B. However, if the basis of the property is determined by reference 
to the basis of other property, the property's holding period is 
determined by reference to the holding period of the other property. For 
example, if S distributes stock to B in a transaction to which section 
355 applies, B's holding period in the distributed stock is determined 
by reference to B's holding period in the stock of S.
    (2) Timing--(i) B's items. B takes its corresponding items into 
account under its accounting method, but the redetermination of the 
attributes of a corresponding item might affect its timing. For example, 
if B's sale of property acquired from S is treated as a dealer 
disposition because of S's activities, section 453(b) prevents any 
corresponding income of B from being taken into account under the 
installment method.
    (ii) S's items. S takes its intercompany item into account to 
reflect the difference for the year between B's corresponding item taken 
into account and the recomputed corresponding item.
    (3) Divisions of a single corporation. As divisions of a single 
corporation, S and B are treated as engaging in their actual transaction 
and owning any actual property involved in the transaction (rather than 
treating the transaction as not occurring). For example, S's sale of 
land held for investment to B for cash is not disregarded, but is 
treated as an exchange of land for cash between divisions (and B 
therefore succeeds to S's basis in the property). Similarly, S's 
issuance of its own stock to B in exchange for property is not 
disregarded, B is treated as owning the stock it receives in the 
exchange, and section 1032 does not apply to B on its subsequent sale of 
the S stock. Although treated as divisions, S and B nevertheless are 
treated as:
    (i) Operating separate trades or businesses. See, e.g., Sec. 1.446-
1(d) (accounting methods for a taxpayer engaged in more than one 
business).
    (ii) Having any special status that they have under the Internal 
Revenue Code or regulations. For example, a bank defined in section 581, 
a domestic building and loan association defined in section 7701(a)(19), 
and an insurance company to which section 801 or 831 applies are treated 
as divisions having separate special status. On the other hand, the fact 
that a member holds property for sale to customers in the ordinary 
course of its trade or business is not a special status.
    (4) Conflict or allocation of attributes. This paragraph (c)(4) 
provides special rules for redetermining and allocating attributes under 
paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.
    (i) Offsetting amounts--(A) In general. To the extent B's 
corresponding item offsets S's intercompany item in amount, the 
attributes of B's corresponding item, determined based on both S's and 
B's activities, control the attributes of S's offsetting intercompany 
item. For example, if S sells depreciable property to B at a gain and B 
depreciates the property, the attributes of B's depreciation deduction 
(ordinary deduction) control the attributes of S's offsetting 
intercompany gain. Accordingly, S's gain is ordinary.
    (B) B controls unreasonable. To the extent the results under 
paragraph (c)(4)(i)(A) are inconsistent with treating S and B as 
divisions of a single corporation, the attributes of the offsetting 
items must be redetermined in a manner consistent with treating S and B 
as divisions of a single corporation. To the extent, however, that B's 
corresponding item on a separate entity basis is excluded from gross 
income, is a noncapital, nondeductible amount, or is otherwise 
permanently disallowed or eliminated, the attributes of B's 
corresponding item always control the attributes of S's offsetting 
intercompany item.

[[Page 270]]

    (ii) Allocation. To the extent S's intercompany item and B's 
corresponding item do not offset in amount, the attributes redetermined 
under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section must be allocated to S's 
intercompany item and B's corresponding item by using a method that is 
reasonable in light of all the facts and circumstances, including the 
purposes of this section and any other rule affected by the attributes 
of S's intercompany item and B's corresponding item. A method of 
allocation or redetermination is unreasonable if it is not used 
consistently by all members of the group from year to year.
    (5) Special status. Notwithstanding the general rule of paragraph 
(c)(1)(i) of this section, to the extent an item's attributes determined 
under this section are permitted or not permitted to a member under the 
Internal Revenue Code or regulations by reason of the member's special 
status, the attributes required under the Internal Revenue Code or 
regulations apply to that member's items (but not the other member). For 
example, if S is a bank to which section 582(c) applies, and sells debt 
securities at a gain to B, a nonbank, the character of S's intercompany 
gain is ordinary as required under section 582(c), but the character of 
B's corresponding item as capital or ordinary is determined under 
paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section without the application of section 
582(c). For other special status issues, see, for example, sections 
595(b) (foreclosure on property securing loans), 818(b) (life insurance 
company treatment of capital gains and losses), and 1503(c) (limitation 
on absorption of certain losses).
    (6) Treatment of intercompany items if corresponding items are 
excluded or nondeductible--(i) In general. Under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of 
this section, S's intercompany item might be redetermined to be excluded 
from gross income or treated as a noncapital, nondeductible amount. For 
example, S's intercompany loss from the sale of property to B is treated 
as a noncapital, nondeductible amount if B distributes the property to a 
nonmember shareholder at no further gain or loss (because, if S and B 
were divisions of a single corporation, the loss would not have been 
recognized under section 311(a)). Paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section, 
however, provides limitations on the application of this rule to 
intercompany income or gain. See also Sec. Sec. 1.1502-32 and 1.1502-33 
(adjustments to S's stock basis and earnings and profits to reflect 
amounts so treated).
    (ii) Limitation on treatment of intercompany items as excluded from 
gross income. Notwithstanding the general rule of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of 
this section, S's intercompany income or gain is redetermined to be 
excluded from gross income only to the extent one of the following 
applies:
    (A) Disallowed amounts. B's corresponding item is a deduction or 
loss and, in the taxable year the item is taken into account under this 
section, it is permanently and explicitly disallowed under another 
provision of the Internal Revenue Code or regulations. For example, 
deductions that are disallowed under section 265 are permanently and 
explicitly disallowed. An amount is not permanently and explicitly 
disallowed, for example, to the extent that--
    (1) The Internal Revenue Code or regulations provide that the amount 
is not recognized (for example, a loss that is realized but not 
recognized under section 332 or section 355(c) is not permanently and 
explicitly disallowed, notwithstanding that it is a corresponding item 
within the meaning of paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section (certain 
disallowed or eliminated amounts));
    (2) A related amount might be taken into account by B with respect 
to successor property, such as under section 280B (demolition costs 
recoverable as capitalized amounts);
    (3) A related amount might be taken into account by another 
taxpayer, such as under section 267(d) (disallowed loss under section 
267(a) might result in nonrecognition of gain for a related person);
    (4) A related amount might be taken into account as a deduction or 
loss, including as a carryforward to a later year, under any provision 
of the Internal Revenue Code or regulations (whether or not the 
carryforward expires in a later year); or

[[Page 271]]

    (5) The amount is reflected in the computation of any credit against 
(or other reduction of) Federal income tax (whether allowed for the 
taxable year or carried forward to a later year).
    (B) Section 311. The corresponding item is a loss that is realized, 
but not recognized under section 311(a) on a distribution to a nonmember 
(even though the loss is not a permanently and explicitly disallowed 
amount within the meaning of paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(A) of this section).
    (C) Other amounts. The Commissioner determines that treating S's 
intercompany item as excluded from gross income is consistent with the 
purposes of this section and other applicable provisions of the Internal 
Revenue Code and regulations.
    (7) Examples--(i) In general. For purposes of the examples in this 
section, unless otherwise stated, P is the common parent of the P 
consolidated group, P owns all of the only class of stock of 
subsidiaries S and B, X is a person unrelated to any member of the P 
group, the taxable year of all persons is the calendar year, all persons 
use the accrual method of accounting, tax liabilities are disregarded, 
the facts set forth the only corporate activity, no member has any 
special status, and the transaction is not otherwise subject to 
recharacterization. If a member acts as both a selling member and a 
buying member (e.g., with respect to different aspects of a single 
transaction, or with respect to related transactions), the member is 
referred to as M, M1, or M2 (rather than as S or B).
    (ii) Matching rule. The matching rule of this paragraph (c) is 
illustrated by the following examples.

    Example 1. Intercompany sale of land followed by sale to a 
nonmember. (a) Facts. S holds land for investment with a basis of $70. S 
has held the land for more than one year. On January 1 of Year 1, S 
sells the land to B for $100. B also holds the land for investment. On 
July 1 of Year 3, B sells the land to X for $110.
    (b) Definitions. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, S's sale of 
the land to B is an intercompany transaction, S is the selling member, 
and B is the buying member. Under paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this 
section, S's $30 gain from the sale to B is its intercompany item, and 
B's $10 gain from the sale to X is its corresponding item.
    (c) Attributes. Under the matching rule of paragraph (c) of this 
section, S's $30 intercompany gain and B's $10 corresponding gain are 
taken into account to produce the same effect on consolidated taxable 
income (and consolidated tax liability) as if S and B were divisions of 
a single corporation. In addition, the holding periods of S and B for 
the land are aggregated. Thus, the group's entire $40 of gain is long-
term capital gain. Because both S's intercompany item and B's 
corresponding item on a separate entity basis are long-term capital 
gain, the attributes are not redetermined under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of 
this section.
    (d) Timing. For each consolidated return year, S takes its 
intercompany item into account under the matching rule to reflect the 
difference for the year between B's corresponding item taken into 
account and the recomputed corresponding item. If S and B were divisions 
of a single corporation and the intercompany sale were a transfer 
between the divisions, B would succeed to S's $70 basis in the land and 
would have a $40 gain from the sale to X in Year 3, instead of a $10 
gain. Consequently, S takes no gain into account in Years 1 and 2, and 
takes the entire $30 gain into account in Year 3, to reflect the $30 
difference in that year between the $10 gain B takes into account and 
the $40 recomputed gain (the recomputed corresponding item). Under 
Sec. Sec. 1.1502-32 and 1.1502-33, P's basis in its S stock and the 
earnings and profits of S and P do not reflect S's $30 gain until the 
gain is taken into account in Year 3. (Under paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section, the results would be the same if S sold the land to B in an 
installment sale to which section 453 would otherwise apply, because S 
must take its intercompany gain into account under this section.)
    (e) Intercompany loss followed by sale to a nonmember at a gain. The 
facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this Example 1, except that 
S's basis in the land is $130 (rather than $70). The attributes and 
timing of S's intercompany loss and B's corresponding gain are 
determined under the matching rule in the manner provided in paragraphs 
(c) and (d) of this Example 1. If S and B were divisions of a single 
corporation and the intercompany sale were a transfer between the 
divisions, B would succeed to S's $130 basis in the land and would have 
a $20 loss from the sale to X instead of a $10 gain. Thus, S takes its 
entire $30 loss into account in Year 3 to reflect the $30 difference 
between B's $10 gain taken into account and the $20 recomputed loss. 
(The results are the same under section 267(f).) S's $30 loss is long-
term capital loss, and B's $10 gain is long-term capital gain.
    (f) Intercompany gain followed by sale to a nonmember at a loss. The 
facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this Example 1, except that B 
sells the land to X for $90 (rather than

[[Page 272]]

$110). The attributes and timing of S's intercompany gain and B's 
corresponding loss are determined under the matching rule. If S and B 
were divisions of a single corporation and the intercompany sale were a 
transfer between the divisions, B would succeed to S's $70 basis in the 
land and would have a $20 gain from the sale to X instead of a $10 loss. 
Thus, S takes its entire $30 gain into account in Year 3 to reflect the 
$30 difference between B's $10 loss taken into account and the $20 
recomputed gain. S's $30 gain is long-term capital gain, and B's $10 
loss is long-term capital loss.
    (g) Intercompany gain followed by distribution to a nonmember at a 
loss. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this Example 1, 
except that B distributes the land to X, a minority shareholder of B, 
and at the time of the distribution the land has a fair market value of 
$90. The attributes and timing of S's intercompany gain and B's 
corresponding loss are determined under the matching rule. Under section 
311(a), B does not recognize its $10 loss on the distribution to X. If S 
and B were divisions of a single corporation and the intercompany sale 
were a transfer between divisions, B would succeed to S's $70 basis in 
the land and would have a $20 gain from the distribution to X instead of 
an unrecognized $10 loss. Under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, 
B's loss that is not recognized under section 311(a) is a corresponding 
item. Thus, S takes its $30 gain into account under the matching rule in 
Year 3 to reflect the difference between B's $10 corresponding 
unrecognized loss and the $20 recomputed gain. B's $10 corresponding 
loss offsets $10 of S's intercompany gain and, under paragraph (c)(4)(i) 
of this section, the attributes of B's corresponding item control the 
attributes of S's intercompany item. Paragraph (c)(6) of this section 
does not prevent the redetermination of S's intercompany item as 
excluded from gross income. (See paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(B) of this 
section). Thus, $10 of S's $30 gain is redetermined to be excluded from 
gross income.
    (h) Intercompany sale followed by section 1031 exchange with 
nonmember. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this Example 1, 
except that, instead of selling the land to X, B exchanges the land for 
land owned by X in a transaction to which section 1031 applies. There is 
no difference in Year 3 between B's $0 corresponding item taken into 
account and the $0 recomputed corresponding item. Thus, none of S's 
intercompany gain is taken into account under the matching rule as a 
result of the section 1031 exchange. Instead, B's gain is preserved in 
the land received from X and, under the successor asset rule of 
paragraph (j)(1) of this section, S's intercompany gain is taken into 
account by reference to the replacement property. (If B takes gain into 
account as a result of boot received in the exchange, S's intercompany 
gain is taken into account under the matching rule to the extent the 
boot causes a difference between B's gain taken into account and the 
recomputed gain.)
    (i) Intercompany sale followed by section 351 transfer to nonmember. 
The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this Example 1, except 
that, instead of selling the land to X, B transfers the land to X in a 
transaction to which section 351(a) applies and X remains a nonmember. 
There is no difference in Year 3 between B's $0 corresponding item taken 
into account and the $0 recomputed corresponding item. Thus, none of S's 
intercompany gain is taken into account under the matching rule as a 
result of the section 351(a) transfer. However, S's entire gain is taken 
into account in Year 3 under the acceleration rule of paragraph (d) of 
this section (because X, a nonmember, reflects B's $100 cost basis in 
the land under section 362).
    Example 2. Dealer activities. (a) Facts. S holds land for investment 
with a basis of $70. On January 1 of Year 1, S sells the land to B for 
$100. B develops the land as residential real estate, and sells 
developed lots to customers during Year 3 for an aggregate amount of 
$110.
    (b) Attributes. S and B are treated under the matching rule as 
divisions of a single corporation for purposes of determining the 
attributes of S's intercompany item and B's corresponding item. Thus, 
although S held the land for investment, whether the gain is treated as 
from the sale of property described in section 1221(1) is based on the 
activities of both S and B. If, based on both S's and B's activities, 
the land is described in section 1221(1), both S's gain and B's gain are 
ordinary income.
    Example 3. Intercompany section 351 transfer. (a) Facts. S holds 
land with a $70 basis and a $100 fair market value for sale to customers 
in the ordinary course of business. On January 1 of Year 1, S transfers 
the land to B in exchange for all of the stock of B in a transaction to 
which section 351 applies. S has no gain or loss under section 351(a), 
and its basis in the B stock is $70 under section 358. Under section 
362, B's basis in the land is $70. B holds the land for investment. On 
July 1 of Year 3, B sells the land to X for $100. Assume that if S and B 
were divisions of a single corporation, B's gain from the sale would be 
ordinary income because of S's activities.
    (b) Timing and attributes. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, 
S's transfer to B is an intercompany transaction. Under paragraph (c)(3) 
of this section, S is treated as transferring the land in exchange for 
B's stock even though, as divisions, S could not own stock of B. S has 
no intercompany item, but B's $30 gain from its sale of the land to X is 
a corresponding item because the land was acquired in an intercompany 
transaction. B's $30 gain is ordinary income that is taken

[[Page 273]]

into account under B's method of accounting.
    (c) Intercompany section 351 transfer with boot. The facts are the 
same as in paragraph (a) of this Example 3, except that S receives $10 
cash in addition to the B stock in the transfer. S recognizes $10 of 
gain under section 351(b), and its basis in the B stock is $70 under 
section 358. Under section 362, B's basis in the land is $80. S takes 
its $10 intercompany gain into account in Year 3 to reflect the $10 
difference between B's $20 corresponding gain taken into account and the 
$30 recomputed gain. Both S's $10 gain and B's $20 gain are ordinary 
income.
    (d) Partial disposition. The facts are the same as in paragraph (c) 
of this Example 3, except B sells only a one- half, undivided interest 
in the land to X for $50. The timing and attributes are determined in 
the manner provided in paragraph (b) of this Example 3, except that S 
takes only $5 of its gain into account in Year 3 to reflect the $5 
difference between B's $10 gain taken into account and the $15 
recomputed gain.
    Example 4. Depreciable property. (a) Facts. On January 1 of Year 1, 
S buys 10-year recovery property for $100 and depreciates it under the 
straight-line method. On January 1 of Year 3, S sells the property to B 
for $130. Under section 168(i)(7), B is treated as S for purposes of 
section 168 to the extent B's $130 basis does not exceed S's adjusted 
basis at the time of the sale. B's additional basis is treated as new 
10-year recovery property for which B elects the straight-line method of 
recovery. (To simplify the example, the half-year convention is 
disregarded.)
    (b) Depreciation through Year 3; intercompany gain. S claims $10 of 
depreciation for each of Years 1 and 2 and has an $80 basis at the time 
of the sale to B. Thus, S has a $50 intercompany gain from its sale to 
B. For Year 3, B has $10 of depreciation with respect to $80 of its 
basis (the portion of its $130 basis not exceeding S's adjusted basis). 
In addition, B has $5 of depreciation with respect to the $50 of its 
additional basis that exceeds S's adjusted basis.
    (c) Timing. S's $50 gain is taken into account to reflect the 
difference for each consolidated return year between B's depreciation 
taken into account with respect to the property and the recomputed 
depreciation. For Year 3, B takes $15 of depreciation into account. If 
the intercompany transaction were a transfer between divisions of a 
single corporation, B would succeed to S's adjusted basis in the 
property and take into account only $10 of depreciation for Year 3. 
Thus, S takes $5 of gain into account in Year 3. In each subsequent year 
that B takes into account $15 of depreciation with respect to the 
property, S takes into account $5 of gain.
    (d) Attributes. Under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the 
attributes of S's gain and B's depreciation must be redetermined to the 
extent necessary to produce the same effect on consolidated taxable 
income as if the intercompany transaction were between divisions of a 
single corporation (the group must have a net depreciation deduction of 
$10). In each year, $5 of B's corresponding depreciation deduction 
offsets S's $5 intercompany gain taken into account and, under paragraph 
(c)(4)(i) of this section, the attributes of B's corresponding item 
control the attributes of S's intercompany item. Accordingly, S's 
intercompany gain that is taken into account as a result of B's 
depreciation deduction is ordinary income.
    (e) Sale of property to a nonmember. The facts are the same as in 
paragraph (a) of this Example 4, except that B sells the property to X 
on January 1 of Year 5 for $110. As set forth in paragraphs (c) and (d) 
of this Example 4, B has $15 of depreciation with respect to the 
property in each of Years 3 and 4, causing S to take $5 of intercompany 
gain into account in each year as ordinary income. The $40 balance of 
S's intercompany gain is taken into account in Year 5 as a result of B's 
sale to X, to reflect the $40 difference between B's $10 gain taken into 
account and the $50 of recomputed gain ($110 of sale proceeds minus the 
$60 basis B would have if the intercompany sale were a transfer between 
divisions of a single corporation). Treating S and B as divisions of a 
single corporation, $40 of the gain is section 1245 gain and $10 is 
section 1231 gain. On a separate entity basis, S would have more than 
$10 treated as section 1231 gain, and B would have no amount treated as 
section 1231 gain. Under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, all $10 
of the section 1231 gain is allocated to S. S's remaining $30 of gain, 
and all of B's $10 gain, is treated as section 1245 gain.
    Example 5. Intercompany sale followed by installment sale. (a) 
Facts. S holds land for investment with a basis of $70x. On January 1 of 
Year 1, S sells the land to B for $100x. B also holds the land for 
investment. On July 1 of Year 3, B sells the land to X in exchange for 
X's $110x note. The note bears a market rate of interest in excess of 
the applicable Federal rate, and provides for principal payments of $55x 
in Year 4 and $55x in Year 5. The interest charge under section 453A(c) 
applies to X's note.
    (b) Timing and attributes. S takes its $30x gain into account to 
reflect the difference in each consolidated return year between B's gain 
taken into account for the year and the recomputed gain. Under section 
453, B takes into account $5x of gain in Year 4 and $5x of gain in Year 
5. Thus, S takes into account $15x of gain in Year 4 and $15x of gain in 
Year 5 to reflect the $15x difference in each of those years between B's 
$5x gain taken into account and the $20x recomputed gain. Both S's $30x 
gain and B's $10x gain are subject to the section 453A(c) interest 
charge beginning in Year 3.

[[Page 274]]

    (c) Election out under section 453(d). If, under the facts in 
paragraph (a) of this Example 5, the P group wishes to elect not to 
apply section 453 with respect to S's gain, an election under section 
453(d) must be made for Year 3 with respect to B's gain. This election 
will cause B's $10x gain to be taken into account in Year 3. Under the 
matching rule, this will result in S's $30x gain being taken into 
account in Year 3. (An election by the P group solely with respect to 
S's gain has no effect because the gain from S's sale to B is taken into 
account under the matching rule, and therefore must reflect the 
difference between B's gain taken into account and the recomputed gain.)
    (d) Sale to a nonmember at a loss, but overall gain. The facts are 
the same as in paragraph (a) of this Example 5, except that B sells the 
land to X in exchange for X's $90x note (rather than $110x note). If S 
and B were divisions of a single corporation, B would succeed to S's 
basis in the land, and the sale to X would be eligible for installment 
reporting under section 453, because it resulted in an overall gain. 
However, because only gains may be reported on the installment method, 
B's $10x corresponding loss is taken into account in Year 3. Under 
paragraph (b)(4) of this section the recomputed corresponding item is 
$20x gain that would be taken into account under the installment method, 
$0 in Year 3 and $10x in each of Years 4 and 5. Thus, in Year 3 S takes 
$10x of gain into account to reflect the difference between B's $10x 
loss taken into account and the $0 recomputed gain for Year 3. Under 
paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, B's $10x corresponding loss offsets 
$10x of S's intercompany gain, and B's attributes control. S takes $10x 
of gain into account in each of Years 4 and 5 to reflect the difference 
in those years between B's $0 gain taken into account and the $10x 
recomputed gain that would be taken into account under the installment 
method. Only the $20x of S's gain taken into account in Years 4 and 5 is 
subject to the interest charge under section 453A(c) beginning in Year 
3. (If P elects under section 453(d) for Year 3 not to apply section 453 
with respect to the gain, all of S's $30x gain will be taken into 
account in Year 3 to reflect the difference between B's $10x loss taken 
into account and the $20x recomputed gain.)
    (e) Intercompany loss, installment gain. The facts are the same as 
in paragraph (a) of this Example 5, except that S has a $130x (rather 
than $70x) basis in the land. Under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, 
the separate entity attributes of S's and B's items from the 
intercompany transaction must be redetermined to produce the same effect 
on consolidated taxable income (and tax liability) as if the transaction 
had been a transfer between divisions. If S and B were divisions of a 
single corporation, B would succeed to S's basis in the land and the 
group would have $20x loss from the sale to X, installment reporting 
would be unavailable, and the interest charge under section 453A(c) 
would not apply. Accordingly, B's gain from the transaction is not 
eligible for installment treatment under section 453. B takes its $10x 
gain into account in Year 3, and S takes its $30x of loss into account 
in Year 3 to reflect the difference between B's $10x gain and the $20x 
recomputed loss.
    (f) Recapture income. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of 
this Example 5, except that S bought depreciable property (rather than 
land) for $100x, claimed depreciation deductions, and reduced the 
property's basis to $70x before Year 1. (To simplify the example, B's 
depreciation is disregarded.) If the intercompany sale of property had 
been a transfer between divisions of a single corporation, $30x of the 
$40x gain from the sale to X would be section 1245 gain (which is 
ineligible for installment reporting) and $10x would be section 1231 
gain (which is eligible for installment reporting). On a separate entity 
basis, S would have $30x of section 1245 gain and B would have $10x of 
section 1231 gain. Accordingly, the attributes are not redetermined 
under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. All of B's $10x gain is 
eligible for installment reporting and is taken into account $5x each in 
Years 4 and 5 (and is subject to the interest charge under section 
453A(c)). S's $30x gain is taken into account in Year 3 to reflect the 
difference between B's $0 gain taken into account and the $30x of 
recomputed gain. (If S had bought the depreciable property for $110x and 
its recomputed basis under section 1245 had been $110x (rather than 
$100x), B's $10x gain and S's $30x gain would both be recapture income 
ineligible for installment reporting.)
    Example 6. Intercompany sale of installment obligation. (a) Facts. S 
holds land for investment with a basis of $70x. On January 1 of Year 1, 
S sells the land to X in exchange for X's $100x note, and S reports its 
gain on the installment method under section 453. X's note bears 
interest at a market rate of interest in excess of the applicable 
Federal rate, and provides for principal payments of $50x in Year 5 and 
$50x in Year 6. Section 453A applies to X's note. On July 1 of Year 3, S 
sells X's note to B for $100x, resulting in $30x gain from S's prior 
sale of the land to X under section 453B(a).
    (b) Timing and attributes. S's sale of X's note to B is an 
intercompany transaction, and S's $30x gain is intercompany gain. S 
takes $15x of the gain into account in each of Years 5 and 6 to reflect 
the $15x difference in each year between B's $0 gain taken into account 
and the $15x recomputed gain. S's gain continues to be treated as its 
gain from the sale to X, and the deferred tax liability remains subject 
to the interest charge under section 453A(c).

[[Page 275]]

    (c) Worthlessness. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of 
this Example 6, except that X's note becomes worthless on December 1 of 
Year 3 and B has a $100x short-term capital loss under section 165(g) on 
a separate entity basis. Under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, B's 
holding period for X's note is aggregated with S's holding period. Thus, 
B's loss is a long- term capital loss. S takes its $30x gain into 
account in Year 3 to reflect the $30x difference between B's $100x loss 
taken into account and the $70x recomputed loss. Under paragraph 
(c)(1)(i) of this section, S's gain is long-term capital gain.
    (d) Pledge. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this 
Example 6, except that, on December 1 of Year 3, B borrows $100x from an 
unrelated bank and secures the indebtedness with X's note. X's note 
remains subject to section 453A(d) following the sale to B. Under 
section 453A(d), B's $100x of proceeds from the secured indebtedness is 
treated as an amount received on December 1 of Year 3 by B on X's note. 
Thus, S takes its entire $30x gain into account in Year 3.
    Example 7. Performance of services. (a) Facts. S is a driller of 
water wells. B operates a ranch in a remote location, and B's taxable 
income from the ranch is not subject to section 447. B's ranch requires 
water to maintain its cattle. During Year 1, S drills an artesian well 
on B's ranch in exchange for $100 from B, and S incurs $80 of expenses 
(e.g., for employees and equipment). B capitalizes its $100 cost for the 
well under section 263, and takes into account $10 of cost recovery 
deductions in each of Years 2 through 11. Under its separate entity 
method of accounting, S would take its income and expenses into account 
in Year 1. If S and B were divisions of a single corporation, the costs 
incurred in drilling the well would be capitalized.
    (b) Definitions. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the service 
transaction is an intercompany transaction, S is the selling member, and 
B is the buying member. Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, S's 
$100 of income and $80 of related expenses are both included in 
determining its intercompany income of $20.
    (c) Timing and attributes. S's $20 of intercompany income is taken 
into account under the matching rule to reflect the $20 difference 
between B's corresponding items taken into account (based on its $100 
cost basis in the well) and the recomputed corresponding items (based on 
the $80 basis that B would have if S and B were divisions of a single 
corporation and B's basis were determined by reference to S's $80 of 
expenses). In Year 1, S takes into account $80 of its income and the $80 
of expenses. In each of Years 2 through 11, S takes $2 of its $20 
intercompany income into account to reflect the annual $2 difference 
between B's $10 of cost recovery deductions taken into account and the 
$8 of recomputed cost recovery deductions. S's $100 income and $80 
expenses, and B's cost recovery deductions, are ordinary items (because 
S's and B's items would be ordinary on a separate entity basis, the 
attributes are not redetermined under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this 
section). If S's offsetting $80 of income and expense would not be taken 
into account in the same year under its separate entity method of 
accounting, they nevertheless must be taken into account under this 
section in a manner that clearly reflects consolidated taxable income. 
See paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section.
    (d) Sale of capitalized services. The facts are the same as in 
paragraph (a) of this Example 7, except that B sells the ranch before 
Year 11 and recognizes gain attributable to the well. To the extent of 
S's income taken into account as a result of B's cost recovery 
deductions, as well as S's offsetting $80 of income and expense, the 
timing and attributes are determined in the manner provided in paragraph 
(c) of this Example 7. The attributes of the remainder of S's $20 of 
income and B's gain from the sale are redetermined to produce the same 
effect on consolidated taxable income as if S and B were divisions of a 
single corporation. Accordingly, S's remaining intercompany income is 
treated as recapture income or section 1231 gain, even though it is from 
S's performance of services.
    Example 8. Rental of property. B operates a ranch that requires 
grazing land for its cattle. S owns undeveloped land adjoining B's 
ranch. On January 1 of Year 1, S leases grazing rights to B for Year 1. 
B's $100 rent expense is deductible for Year 1 under its separate entity 
accounting method. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the rental 
transaction is an intercompany transaction, S is the selling member, and 
B is the buying member. S takes its $100 of income into account in Year 
1 to reflect the $100 difference between B's rental deduction taken into 
account and the $0 recomputed rental deduction. S's income and B's 
deduction are ordinary items (because S's intercompany item and B's 
corresponding item would both be ordinary on a separate entity basis, 
the attributes are not redetermined under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this 
section).
    Example 9. Intercompany sale of a partnership interest. (a) Facts. S 
owns a 20% interest in the capital and profits of a general partnership. 
The partnership holds land for investment with a basis equal to its 
value, and operates depreciable assets which have value in excess of 
basis. S's basis in its partnership interest equals its share of the 
adjusted basis of the partnership's land and depreciable assets. The 
partnership has an election under section 754 in effect. On January 1 of 
Year 1, S sells its partnership interest to B at a gain. During Years 1 
through 10, the partnership depreciates the operating assets, and B's

[[Page 276]]

depreciation deductions from the partnership reflect the increase in the 
basis of the depreciable assets under section 743(b).
    (b) Timing and attributes. S's gain is taken into account during 
Years 1 through 10 to reflect the difference in each year between B's 
depreciation deductions from the partnership taken into account and the 
recomputed depreciation deductions from the partnership. Under 
paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(4)(i) of this section, S's gain taken into 
account is ordinary income. (The acceleration rule does not apply to S's 
gain as a result of the section 743(b) adjustment, because the 
adjustment is solely with respect to B and therefore no nonmember 
reflects any part of the intercompany transaction.)
    (c) Partnership sale of assets. The facts are the same as in 
paragraph (a) of this Example 9, and the partnership sells some of its 
depreciable assets to X at a gain on December 31 of Year 4. In addition 
to the intercompany gain taken into account as a result of the 
partnership's depreciation, S takes intercompany gain into account in 
Year 4 to reflect the difference between B's partnership items taken 
into account from the sale (which reflect the basis increase under 
section 743(b)) and the recomputed partnership items. The attributes of 
S's additional gain are redetermined to produce the same effect on 
consolidated taxable income as if S and B were divisions of a single 
corporation (recapture income or section 1231 gain).
    (d) B's sale of partnership interest. The facts are the same as in 
paragraph (a) of this Example 9, and on December 31 of Year 4, B sells 
its partnership interest to X at no gain or loss. In addition to the 
intercompany gain taken into account as a result of the partnership's 
depreciation, the remaining balance of S's intercompany gain is taken 
into account in Year 4 to reflect the difference between B's $0 gain 
taken into account from the sale of the partnership interest and the 
recomputed gain. The character of S's remaining intercompany item and 
B's corresponding item are determined on a separate entity basis under 
section 751, and then redetermined to the extent necessary to produce 
the same effect as treating the intercompany transaction as occurring 
between divisions of a single corporation.
    (e) No section 754 election. The facts are the same as in paragraph 
(d) of this Example 9, except that the partnership does not have a 
section 754 election in effect, and B recognizes a capital loss from its 
sale of the partnership interest to X on December 31 of Year 4. Because 
there is no difference between B's depreciation deductions from the 
partnership taken into account and the recomputed depreciation 
deductions, S does not take any of its gain into account during Years 1 
through 4 as a result of B's partnership's items. Instead, S's entire 
intercompany gain is taken into account in Year 4 to reflect the 
difference between B's loss taken into account from the sale to X and 
the recomputed gain or loss.
    Example 10. Net operating losses subject to section 382 or the SRLY 
rules. (a) Facts. On January 1 of Year 1, P buys all of S's stock. S has 
net operating loss carryovers from prior years. P's acquisition results 
in an ownership change under section 382 with respect to S's loss 
carryovers, and S has a net unrealized built-in gain (within the meaning 
of section 382(h)(3)). S owns nondepreciable property with a $70 basis 
and $100 value. On July 1 of Year 3, S sells the property to B for $100, 
and its $30 gain is recognized built-in gain (within the meaning of 
section 382(h)(2)) on a separate entity basis. On December 1 of Year 5, 
B sells the property to X for $90.
    (b) Timing and attributes. S's $30 gain is taken into account in 
Year 5 to reflect the $30 difference between B's $10 loss taken into 
account and the recomputed $20 gain. S and B are treated as divisions of 
a single corporation for purposes of applying section 382 in connection 
with the intercompany transaction. Under a single entity analysis, the 
single corporation has losses subject to limitation under section 382, 
and this limitation may be increased under section 382(h) if the single 
corporation has recognized built-in gain with respect to those losses. 
B's $10 corresponding loss offsets $10 of S's intercompany gain, and 
thus, under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, $10 of S's intercompany 
gain is redetermined not to be recognized built-in gain. S's remaining 
$20 intercompany gain continues to be treated as recognized built-in 
gain.
    (c) B's recognized built-in gain. The facts are the same as in 
paragraph (a) of this Example 10, except that the property declines in 
value after S becomes a member of the P group, S sells the property to B 
for its $70 basis, and B sells the property to X for $90 during Year 5. 
Treating S and B as divisions of a single corporation, S's sale to B 
does not cause the property to cease to be built-in gain property. Thus, 
B's $20 gain from its sale to X is recognized built-in gain that 
increases the section 382 limitation applicable to S's losses.
    (d) SRLY limitation. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of 
this Example 10, except that P's acquisition of S is not subject to the 
overlap rule of Sec. 1.1502-21(g), and S's net operating loss 
carryovers are subject to the separate return limitation year (SRLY) 
rules. See Sec. 1.1502-21(c). The application of the SRLY rules depends 
on S's status as a separate corporation having losses from separate 
return limitation years. Under paragraph (c)(5), the attribute of S's 
intercompany item as it relates to S's SRLY limitation is not 
redetermined, because the SRLY limitation depends on S's special status. 
Accordingly, S's $30 intercompany gain is included in determining its 
SRLY limitation for Year 5.

[[Page 277]]

    Example 11. Section 475. (a) Facts. S, a dealer in securities within 
the meaning of section 475(c), owns a security with a basis of $70. The 
security is held for sale to customers and is not identified under 
section 475(b) as within an exception to marking to market. On July 1 of 
Year 1, S sells the security to B for $100. B is not a dealer and holds 
the security for investment. On December 31 of Year 1, the fair market 
value of the security is $100. On July 1 of Year 2, B sells the security 
to X for $110.
    (b) Attributes. Under section 475, a dealer in securities can treat 
a security as within an exception to marking to market under section 
475(b) only if it timely identifies the security as so described. Under 
the matching rule, attributes must be redetermined by treating S and B 
as divisions of a single corporation. As a result of S's activities, the 
single corporation is treated as a dealer with respect to securities, 
and B must continue to mark to market the security acquired from S. 
Thus, B's corresponding items and the recomputed corresponding items are 
determined by continuing to treat the security as not within an 
exception to marking to market. Under section 475(d)(3), it is possible 
for the character of S's intercompany items to differ from the character 
of B's corresponding items.
    (c) Timing and character. S has a $30 gain when it disposes of the 
security by selling it to B. This gain is intercompany gain that is 
taken into account in Year 1 to reflect the $30 difference between B's 
$0 gain taken into account from marking the security to market under 
section 475 and the recomputed $30 gain that would be taken into 
account. The character of S's gain and B's gain are redetermined as if 
the security were transferred between divisions. Accordingly, S's gain 
is ordinary income under section 475(d)(3)(A)(i), but under section 
475(d)(3)(B)(ii) B's $10 gain from its sale to X is capital gain that is 
taken into account in Year 2.
    (d) Nondealer to dealer. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) 
of this Example 11, except that S is not a dealer and holds the security 
for investment with a $70 basis, B is a dealer to which section 475 
applies and, immediately after acquiring the security from S for $100, B 
holds the security for sale to customers in the ordinary course of its 
trade or business. Because S is not a dealer and held the security for 
investment, the security is treated as properly identified as held for 
investment under section 475(b)(1) until it is sold to B. Under section 
475(b)(3), the security thereafter ceases to be described in section 
475(b)(1) because B holds the security for sale to customers. The mark-
to-market requirement applies only to changes in the value of the 
security after B's acquisition. B's mark-to-market gain taken into 
account and the recomputed mark-to-market gain are both determined based 
on changes from the $100 value of the security at the time of B's 
acquisition. There is no difference between B's $0 mark-to-market gain 
taken into account in Year 1 and the $0 recomputed mark-to-market gain. 
Therefore, none of S's gain is taken into account in Year 1 as a result 
of B's marking the security to market in Year 1. In Year 2, B has a $10 
gain when it disposes of the security by selling it to X, but would have 
had a $40 gain if S and B were divisions of a single corporation. Thus, 
S takes its $30 gain into account in Year 2 under the matching rule. 
Under section 475(d)(3), S's gain is capital gain even though B's 
subsequent gain or loss from marking to market or disposing of the 
security is ordinary gain or loss. If B disposes of the security at a 
$10 loss in Year 2, S's gain taken into account in Year 2 is still 
capital because on a single entity basis section 475(d)(3) would provide 
for $30 of capital gain and $10 of ordinary loss. Because the attributes 
are not redetermined under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, 
paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section does not apply. Furthermore, if B 
held the security for investment, and so identified the security under 
section 475(b)(1), the security would continue to be excepted from 
marking to market.
    Example 12. Section 1092. (a) Facts. On July 1 of Year 1, S enters 
into offsetting long and short positions with respect to actively traded 
personal property. The positions are not section 1256 contracts, and 
they are the only positions taken into account for purposes of applying 
section 1092. On August 1 of Year 1, S sells the long position to B at 
an $11 loss, and there is $11 of unrealized gain in the offsetting short 
position. On December 1 of Year 1, B sells the long position to X at no 
gain or loss. On December 31 of Year 1, there is still $11 of unrealized 
gain in the short position. On February 1 of Year 2, S closes the short 
position at an $11 gain.
    (b) Timing and attributes. If the sale from S to B were a transfer 
between divisions of a single corporation, the $11 loss on the sale to X 
would have been deferred under section 1092(a)(1)(A). Accordingly, there 
is no difference in Year 1 between B's corresponding item of $0 and the 
recomputed corresponding item of $0. S takes its $11 loss into account 
in Year 2 to reflect the difference between B's corresponding item of $0 
taken into account in Year 2 and the recomputed loss of $11 that would 
have been taken into account in Year 2 under section 1092(a)(1)(B) if S 
and B had been divisions of a single corporation. (The results are the 
same under section 267(f)).
    Example 13. Manufacturer incentive payments. (a) Facts. B is a 
manufacturer that sells its products to independent dealers for resale. 
S is a credit company that offers financing, including financing to 
customers of the dealers. S also purchases the product from the dealers 
for lease to customers of

[[Page 278]]

the dealers. During Year 1, B initiates a program of incentive payments 
to the dealers' customers. Under B's program, S buys a product from an 
independent dealer for $100 and leases it to a nonmember. S pays $90 to 
the dealer for the product, and assigns to the dealer its $10 incentive 
payment from B. Under their separate entity accounting methods, B would 
deduct the $10 incentive payment in Year 1 and S would take a $90 basis 
in the product. Assume that if S and B were divisions of a single 
corporation, the $10 payment would not be deductible and the basis of 
the property would be $100.
    (b) Timing and attributes. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, 
the incentive payment transaction is an intercompany transaction. Under 
paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, S has a $10 intercompany item not 
yet taken into account under its separate entity method of accounting. 
Under the matching rule, S takes its intercompany item into account to 
reflect the difference between B's corresponding item taken into account 
and the recomputed corresponding item. In Year 1 there is a $10 
difference between B's $10 deduction taken into account and the $0 
recomputed deduction. Accordingly, under the matching rule S must take 
the $10 incentive payment into account as intercompany income in Year 1. 
S's $10 of income and B's $10 deduction are ordinary items. S's basis in 
the product is $100 rather than the $90 it would be under S's separate 
entity method of accounting. S's additional $10 of basis in the product 
is recovered based on subsequent events (e.g., S's cost recovery 
deductions or its sale of the product).
    Example 14. Source of income under section 863. (a) Intercompany 
sale with no independent factory price. S manufactures inventory in the 
United States, and recognizes $75 of income on sales to B in Year 1. B 
distributes the inventory in Country Y and recognizes $25 of income on 
sales to X, also in Year 1. Title passes from S to B, and from B to X, 
in Country Y. There is no independent factory price (as defined in 
regulations under section 863) for the sale from S to B. Under the 
matching rule, S's $75 intercompany income and B's $25 corresponding 
income are taken into account in Year 1. In determining the source of 
income, S and B are treated as divisions of a single corporation, and 
section 863 applies as if $100 of income were recognized from producing 
in the United States and selling in Country Y. Assume that applying the 
section 863 regulations on a single entity basis, $50 is treated as 
foreign source income and $50 as U.S. source income. Assume further that 
on a separate entity basis, S would have $37.50 of foreign source income 
and $37.50 of U.S. source income, and that all of B's $25 of income 
would be foreign source income. Thus, on a separate entity basis, S and 
B would have $62.50 of combined foreign source income and $37.50 of U.S. 
source income. Accordingly, under single entity treatment, $12.50 that 
would be treated as foreign source income on a separate entity basis is 
redetermined to be U.S. source income. Under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this 
section, attributes are redetermined only to the extent of the $12.50 
necessary to achieve the same effect as a single entity determination. 
Under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, the redetermined attribute 
must be allocated between S and B using a reasonable method. For 
example, it may be reasonable to recharacterize only S's foreign source 
income as U.S. source income because only S would have any U.S. source 
income on a separate entity basis. However, it may also be reasonable to 
allocate the redetermined attribute between S and B in proportion to 
their separate entity amounts of foreign source income (in a 3:2 ratio, 
so that $7.50 of S's foreign source income is redetermined to be U.S. 
source and $5 of B's foreign source income is redetermined to be U.S. 
source), provided the same method is applied to all similar transactions 
within the group.
    (b) Intercompany sale with independent factory price. The facts are 
the same as in paragraph (a) of this Example 14, except that an 
independent factory price exists for the sale by S to B such that $70 of 
S's $75 of income is attributable to the production function. Assume 
that on a single entity basis, $70 is treated as U.S. source income 
(because of the existence of the independent factory price) and $30 is 
treated as foreign source income. Assume that on a separate entity 
basis, $70 of S's income would be treated as U.S. source, $5 of S's 
income would be treated as foreign source income, and all of B's $25 
income would be treated as foreign source income. Because the results 
are the same on a single entity basis and a separate entity basis, the 
attributes are not redetermined under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this 
section.
    (c) Sale of property reflecting intercompany services or 
intangibles. S earns $10 of income performing services in the United 
States for B. B capitalizes S's fees into the basis of property that it 
manufactures in the United States and sells to an unrelated person in 
Year 1 at a $90 profit, with title passing in Country Y. Under the 
matching rule, S's $10 income and B's $90 income are taken into account 
in Year 1. In determining the source of income, S and B are treated as 
divisions of a single corporation, and section 863 applies as if $100 
were earned from manufacturing in the United States and selling in 
Country Y. Assume that on a single entity basis $50 is treated as 
foreign source income and $50 is treated as U.S. source income. Assume 
that on a separate entity basis, S would have $10 of U.S. source income, 
and B would have $45 of foreign source income and $45 of U.S. source 
income. Accordingly, under single entity treatment, $5 of income that 
would be treated as U.S. source income on a separate

[[Page 279]]

entity basis is redetermined to be foreign source income. Under 
paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, attributes are redetermined only to 
the extent of the $5 necessary to achieve the same effect as a single 
entity determination. Under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, the 
redetermined attribute must be allocated between S and B using a 
reasonable method. (If instead of performing services, S licensed an 
intangible to B and earned $10 that would be treated as U.S. source 
income on a separate entity basis, the results would be the same.)
    Example 15. Section 1248. (a) Facts. On January 1 of Year 1, S forms 
FT, a wholly owned foreign subsidiary, with a $10 contribution. During 
Years 1 through 3, FT has earnings and profits of $40. None of the 
earnings and profits is taxed as subpart F income under section 951, and 
FT distributes no dividends to S during this period. On January 1 of 
Year 4, S sells its FT stock to B for $50. While B owns FT, FT has a 
deficit in earnings and profits of $10. On July 1 of Year 6, B sells its 
FT stock for $70 to X, an unrelated foreign corporation.
    (b) Timing. S's $40 of intercompany gain is taken into account in 
Year 6 to reflect the difference between B's $20 of gain taken into 
account and the $60 recomputed gain.
    (c) Attributes. Under the matching rule, the attributes of S's 
intercompany gain and B's corresponding gain are redetermined to have 
the same effect on consolidated taxable income (and consolidated tax 
liability) as if S and B were divisions of a single corporation. On a 
single entity basis, there is $60 of gain and the portion which is 
characterized as a dividend under section 1248 is determined on the 
basis of FT's $30 of earnings and profits at the time of the sale of FT 
to X (the sum of FT's $40 of earnings and profits while held by S and 
FT's $10 deficit in earnings and profits while held by B). Therefore, 
$30 of the $60 gain is treated as a dividend under section 1248. The 
remaining $30 is treated as capital gain. On a separate entity basis, 
all of S's $40 gain would be treated as a dividend under section 1248 
and all of B's $20 gain would be treated as capital gain. Thus, as a 
result of the single entity determination, $10 that would be treated as 
a dividend under section 1248 on a separate entity basis is redetermined 
to be capital gain. Under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, this 
redetermined attribute must be allocated between S's intercompany item 
and B's corresponding item by using a reasonable method. On a separate 
entity basis, only S would have any amount treated as a dividend under 
section 1248 available for redetermination. Accordingly, $10 of S's 
income is redetermined to be not subject to section 1248, with the 
result that $30 of S's intercompany gain is treated as a dividend and 
the remaining $10 is treated as capital gain. All of B's corresponding 
gain is treated as capital gain, as it would be on a separate entity 
basis.
    (d) B has loss. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this 
Example 15, except that FT has no earnings and profits or deficit in 
earnings and profits while B owns FT, and B sells the FT stock to X for 
$40. On a single entity basis, there is $30 of gain, and section 1248 is 
applied on the basis of FT's $40 earnings and profits at the time of the 
sale of FT to X. Under section 1248, the amount treated as a dividend is 
limited to $30 (the amount of the gain). On a separate entity basis, S's 
entire $40 gain would be treated as a dividend under section 1248, and 
B's $10 loss would be a capital loss. B's $10 corresponding loss offsets 
$10 of S's intercompany gain and, under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this 
section, the attributes of B's corresponding item control. Accordingly, 
$10 of S's gain must be redetermined to be capital gain. B's $10 loss 
remains a capital loss. (If, however, S sold FT to B at a loss and B 
sold FT to X at a gain, it may be unreasonable for the attributes of B's 
corresponding gain to control S's offsetting intercompany loss. If B's 
attributes were to control, for example, the group could possibly claim 
a larger foreign tax credit than would be available if S and B were 
divisions of a single corporation.)

    (d) Acceleration rule. S's intercompany items and B's corresponding 
items are taken into account under this paragraph (d) to the extent they 
cannot be taken into account to produce the effect of treating S and B 
as divisions of a single corporation. For this purpose, the following 
rules apply:
    (1) S's items--(i) Timing. S takes its intercompany items into 
account to the extent they cannot be taken into account to produce the 
effect of treating S and B as divisions of a single corporation. The 
items are taken into account immediately before it first becomes 
impossible to achieve this effect. For this purpose, the effect cannot 
be achieved--
    (A) To the extent an intercompany item or corresponding item will 
not be taken into account in determining the group's consolidated 
taxable income (or consolidated tax liability) under the matching rule 
(for example, if S or B becomes a nonmember, or if S's intercompany item 
is no longer reflected in the difference between B's basis (or an amount 
equivalent to basis) in property and the basis (or equivalent amount) 
the property would have if S and B were divisions of a single 
corporation); or

[[Page 280]]

    (B) To the extent a nonmember reflects, directly or indirectly, any 
aspect of the intercompany transaction (e.g., if B's cost basis in 
property purchased from S is reflected by a nonmember under section 362 
following a section 351 transaction).
    (ii) Attributes. The attributes of S's intercompany items taken into 
account under this paragraph (d)(1) are determined as follows:
    (A) Sale, exchange, or distribution. If the item is from an 
intercompany sale, exchange, or distribution of property, its attributes 
are determined under the principles of the matching rule as if B sold 
the property, at the time the item is taken into account under paragraph 
(d)(1)(i) of this section, for a cash payment equal to B's adjusted 
basis in the property (i.e., at no net gain or loss), to the following 
person:
    (1) Property leaves the group. If the property is owned by a 
nonmember immediately after S's item is taken into account, B is treated 
as selling the property to that nonmember. If the nonmember is related 
for purposes of any provision of the Internal Revenue Code or 
regulations to any party to the intercompany transaction (or any related 
transaction) or to the common parent, the nonmember is treated as 
related to B for purposes of that provision. For example, if the 
nonmember is related to P within the meaning of section 1239(b), the 
deemed sale is treated as being described in section 1239(a). See 
paragraph (j)(6) of this section, under which property is not treated as 
being owned by a nonmember if it is owned by the common parent after the 
common parent becomes the only remaining member.
    (2) Property does not leave the group. If the property is not owned 
by a nonmember immediately after S's item is taken into account, B is 
treated as selling the property to an affiliated corporation that is not 
a member of the group.
    (B) Other transactions. If the item is from an intercompany 
transaction other than a sale, exchange, or distribution of property 
(e.g., income from S's services capitalized by B), its attributes are 
determined on a separate entity basis.
    (2) B's items--(i) Attributes. The attributes of B's corresponding 
items continue to be redetermined under the principles of the matching 
rule, with the following adjustments:
    (A) If S and B continue to join with each other in the filing of 
consolidated returns, the attributes of B's corresponding items (and any 
applicable holding periods) are determined by continuing to treat S and 
B as divisions of a single corporation.
    (B) Once S and B no longer join with each other in the filing of 
consolidated returns, the attributes of B's corresponding items are 
determined as if the S division (but not the B division) were 
transferred by the single corporation to an unrelated person. Thus, S's 
activities (and any applicable holding period) before the intercompany 
transaction continue to affect the attributes of the corresponding items 
(and any applicable holding period).
    (ii) Timing. If paragraph (d)(1) of this section applies to S, B 
nevertheless continues to take its corresponding items into account 
under its accounting method. However, the redetermination of the 
attributes of a corresponding item under this paragraph (d)(2) might 
affect its timing.
    (3) Examples. The acceleration rule of this paragraph (d) is 
illustrated by the following examples.

    Example 1. Becoming a nonmember--timing. (a) Facts. S owns land with 
a basis of $70. On January 1 of Year 1, S sells the land to B for $100. 
On July 1 of Year 3, P sells 60% of S's stock to X for $60 and, as a 
result, S becomes a nonmember.
    (b) Matching rule. Under the matching rule, none of S's $30 gain is 
taken into account in Years 1 through 3 because there is no difference 
between B's $0 gain or loss taken into account and the recomputed gain 
or loss.
    (c) Acceleration of S's intercompany items. Under the acceleration 
rule of paragraph (d) of this section, S's $30 gain is taken into 
account in computing consolidated taxable income (and consolidated tax 
liability) immediately before the effect of treating S and B as 
divisions of a single corporation cannot be produced. Because the effect 
cannot be produced once S becomes a nonmember, S takes its $30 gain into 
account in Year 3 immediately before becoming a nonmember. S's gain is 
reflected under Sec. 1.1502-32 in P's basis in the S stock immediately 
before P's sale of the stock. Under Sec. 1.1502-32, P's basis in the S 
stock is increased by $30, and therefore P's

[[Page 281]]

gain is reduced (or loss is increased) by $18 (60% of $30). See also 
Sec. Sec. 1.1502-33 and 1.1502-76(b). (The results would be the same if 
S sold the land to B in an installment sale to which section 453 would 
otherwise apply, because S must take its intercompany gain into account 
under this section.)
    (d) B's corresponding items. Notwithstanding the acceleration of S's 
gain, B continues to take its corresponding items into account under its 
accounting method. Thus, B's items from the land are taken into account 
based on subsequent events (e.g., its sale of the land).
    (e) Sale of B's stock. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of 
this Example 1, except that P sells 60% of B's stock (rather than S 
stock) to X for $60 and, as a result, B becomes a nonmember. Because the 
effect of treating S and B as divisions of a single corporation cannot 
be produced once B becomes a nonmember, S takes its $30 gain into 
account under the acceleration rule immediately before B becomes a 
nonmember. (The results would be the same if S sold the land to B in an 
installment sale to which section 453 would otherwise apply, because S 
must take its intercompany gain into account under this section.)
    (f) Discontinue filing consolidated returns. The facts are the same 
as in paragraph (a) of this Example 1, except that the P group receives 
permission under Sec. 1.1502-75(c) to discontinue filing consolidated 
returns beginning in Year 3. Under the acceleration rule, S takes its 
$30 gain into account on December 31 of Year 2.
    (g) No subgroups. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this 
Example 1, except that P simultaneously sells all of the stock of both S 
and B to X (rather than 60% of S's stock), and S and B become members of 
the X consolidated group. Because the effect of treating S and B as 
divisions of a single corporation in the P group cannot be produced once 
S and B become nonmembers, S takes its $30 gain into account under the 
acceleration rule immediately before S and B become nonmembers. 
(Paragraph (j)(5) of this section does not apply to treat the X 
consolidated group as succeeding to the P group because the X group 
acquired only the stock of S and B.) However, so long as S and B 
continue to join with each other in the filing of consolidated returns, 
B continues to treat S and B as divisions of a single corporation for 
purposes of determining the attributes of B's corresponding items from 
the land.
    Example 2. Becoming a nonmember--attributes. (a) Facts. S holds land 
for investment with a basis of $70. On January 1 of Year 1, S sells the 
land to B for $100. B holds the land for sale to customers in the 
ordinary course of business, and expends substantial resources over a 
two-year period subdividing, developing, and marketing the land. On July 
1 of Year 3, before B has sold any of the land, P sells 60% of S's stock 
to X for $60 and, as a result, S becomes a nonmember.
    (b) Attributes. Under the acceleration rule, the attributes of S's 
gain are redetermined under the principles of the matching rule as if B 
sold the land to an affiliated corporation that is not a member of the 
group for a cash payment equal to B's adjusted basis in the land 
(because the land continues to be held within the group). Thus, whether 
S's gain is capital gain or ordinary income depends on the activities of 
both S and B. Because S and B no longer join with each other in the 
filing of consolidated returns, the attributes of B's corresponding 
items (e.g., from its subsequent sale of the land) are redetermined 
under the principles of the matching rule as if the S division (but not 
the B division) were transferred by the single corporation to an 
unrelated person at the time of P's sale of the S stock. Thus, B 
continues to take into account the activities of S with respect to the 
land before the intercompany transaction.
    (c) Depreciable property. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) 
of this Example 2, except that the property sold by S to B is 
depreciable property. Section 1239 applies to treat all of S's gain as 
ordinary income because it is taken into account as a result of B's 
deemed sale of the property to a affiliated corporation that is not a 
member of the group (a related person within the meaning of section 
1239(b)).
    Example 3. Selling member's disposition of installment note. (a) 
Facts. S owns land with a basis of $70. On January 1 of Year 1, S sells 
the land to B in exchange for B's $110 note. The note bears a market 
rate of interest in excess of the applicable Federal rate, and provides 
for principal payments of $55 in Year 4 and $55 in Year 5. On July 1 of 
Year 3, S sells B's note to X for $110.
    (b) Timing. S's intercompany gain is taken into account under this 
section, and not under the rules of section 453. Consequently, S's sale 
of B's note does not result in its intercompany gain from the land being 
taken into account (e.g., under section 453B). The sale does not prevent 
S's intercompany items and B's corresponding items from being taken into 
account in determining the group's consolidated taxable income under the 
matching rule, and X does not reflect any aspect of the intercompany 
transaction (X has its own cost basis in the note). S will take the 
intercompany gain into account under the matching rule or acceleration 
rule based on subsequent events (e.g., B's sale of the land). See also 
paragraph (g) of this section for additional rules applicable to B's 
note as an intercompany obligation.
    Example 4. Cancellation of debt and attribute reduction under 
section 108(b). (a) Facts. S holds land for investment with a basis of 
$0. On January 1 of Year 1, S sells the land to B

[[Page 282]]

for $100. B also holds the land for investment. During Year 3, B is 
insolvent and B's nonmember creditors discharge $60 of B's indebtedness. 
Because of insolvency, B's $60 discharge is excluded from B's gross 
income under section 108(a), and B reduces the basis of the land by $60 
under sections 108(b) and 1017.
    (b) Acceleration rule. As a result of B's basis reduction under 
section 1017, $60 of S's intercompany gain will not be taken into 
account under the matching rule (because there is only a $40 difference 
between B's $40 basis in the land and the $0 basis the land would have 
if S and B were divisions of a single corporation). Accordingly, S takes 
$60 of its gain into account under the acceleration rule in Year 3. S's 
gain is long-term capital gain, determined under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of 
this section as if B sold the land to an affiliated corporation that is 
not a member of the group for $100 immediately before the basis 
reduction.
    (c) Purchase price adjustment. Assume instead that S sells the land 
to B in exchange for B's $100 purchase money note, B remains solvent, 
and S subsequently agrees to discharge $60 of the note as a purchase 
price adjustment to which section 108(e)(5) applies. Under applicable 
principles of tax law, $60 of S's gain and $60 of B's basis in the land 
are eliminated and never taken into account. Similarly, the note is not 
treated as satisfied and reissued under paragraph (g) of this section.
    Example 5. Section 481. (a) Facts. S operates several trades or 
businesses, including a manufacturing business. S receives permission to 
change its method of accounting for valuing inventory for its 
manufacturing business. S increases the basis of its ending inventory by 
$100, and the related $100 positive section 481(a) adjustment is to be 
taken into account ratably over six taxable years, beginning in Year 1. 
During Year 3, S sells all of the assets used in its manufacturing 
business to B at a gain. Immediately after the transfer, B does not use 
the same inventory valuation method as S. On a separate entity basis, 
S's sale results in an acceleration of the balance of the section 481(a) 
adjustment to Year 3.
    (b) Timing and attributes. Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, 
the balance of S's section 481(a) adjustment accelerated to Year 3 is 
intercompany income. However, S's $100 basis increase before the 
intercompany transaction eliminates the related difference for this 
amount between B's corresponding items taken into account and the 
recomputed corresponding items in subsequent periods. Because the 
accelerated section 481(a) adjustment will not be taken into account in 
determining the group's consolidated taxable income (and consolidated 
tax liability) under the matching rule, the balance of S's section 481 
adjustment is taken into account under the acceleration rule as ordinary 
income at the time of the intercompany transaction. (If S's sale had not 
resulted in accelerating S's section 481(a) adjustment on a separate 
entity basis, S would have no intercompany income to be taken into 
account under this section.)

    (e) Simplifying rules--(1) Dollar-value LIFO inventory methods--(i) 
In general. This paragraph (e)(1) applies if either S or B uses a 
dollar-value LIFO inventory method to account for intercompany 
transactions. Rather than applying the matching rule separately to each 
intercompany inventory transaction, this paragraph (e)(1) provides 
methods to apply an aggregate approach that is based on dollar-value 
LIFO inventory accounting. Any method selected under this paragraph 
(e)(1) must be applied consistently.
    (ii) B uses dollar-value LIFO--(A) In general. If B uses a dollar-
value LIFO inventory method to account for its intercompany inventory 
purchases, and includes all of its inventory costs incurred for a year 
in its cost of goods sold for the year (that is, B has no inventory 
increment for the year), S takes into account all of its intercompany 
inventory items for the year. If B does not include all of its inventory 
costs incurred for the year in its cost of goods sold for the year (that 
is, B has an inventory increment for the year), S does not take all of 
its intercompany inventory income or loss into account. The amount not 
taken into account is determined under either the increment averaging 
method of paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(B) of this section or the increment 
valuation method of paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(C) of this section. Separate 
computations are made for each pool of B that receives intercompany 
purchases from S, and S's amount not taken into account is layered based 
on B's LIFO inventory layers.
    (B) Increment averaging method. Under this paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(B), 
the amount not taken into account is the amount of S's intercompany 
inventory income or loss multiplied by the ratio of the LIFO value of 
B's current-year costs of its layer of increment to B's total inventory 
costs incurred for the year under its LIFO inventory method. If B 
includes more than its inventory costs incurred during any subsequent 
year in its cost of goods sold (a decrement), S

[[Page 283]]

takes into account the intercompany inventory income or loss layers in 
the same manner and proportion as B takes into account its inventory 
decrements.
    (C) Increment valuation method. Under this paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(C), 
the amount not taken into account is the amount of S's intercompany 
inventory income or loss for the appropriate period multiplied by the 
ratio of the LIFO value of B's current-year costs of its layer of 
increment to B's total inventory costs incurred in the appropriate 
period under its LIFO inventory method. The principles of paragraph 
(e)(1)(ii)(B) of this section otherwise apply. The appropriate period is 
the period of B's year used to determine its current-year costs.
    (iii) S uses dollar-value LIFO. If S uses a dollar-value LIFO 
inventory method to account for its intercompany inventory sales, S may 
use any reasonable method of allocating its LIFO inventory costs to 
intercompany transactions. LIFO inventory costs include costs of prior 
layers if a decrement occurs. For example, a reasonable allocation of 
the most recent costs incurred during the consolidated return year can 
be used to compute S's intercompany inventory income or loss for the 
year if S has an inventory increment and uses the earliest acquisitions 
costs method, but S must apportion costs from the most recent 
appropriate layers of increment if an inventory decrement occurs for the 
year.
    (iv) Other reasonable methods. S or B may use a method not 
specifically provided in this paragraph (e)(1) that is expected to 
reasonably take into account intercompany items and corresponding items 
from intercompany inventory transactions. However, if the method used 
results, for any year, in a cumulative amount of intercompany inventory 
items not taken into account by S that significantly exceeds the 
cumulative amount that would not be taken into account under paragraph 
(e)(1)(ii) or (iii) of this section, S must take into account for that 
year the amount necessary to eliminate the excess. The method is 
thereafter applied with appropriate adjustments to reflect the amount 
taken into account.
    (v) Examples. The inventory rules of this paragraph (e)(1) are 
illustrated by the following examples.

    Example 1. Increment averaging method. (a) Facts. Both S and B use a 
double-extension, dollar-value LIFO inventory method, and both value 
inventory increments using the earliest acquisitions cost valuation 
method. During Year 2, S sells 25 units of product Q to B on January 15 
at $10/unit. S sells another 25 units on April 15, on July 15, and on 
September 15, at $12/unit. S's earliest cost of product Q is $7.50/unit 
and S's most recent cost of product Q is $8.00/unit. Both S and B have 
an inventory increment for the year. B's total inventory costs incurred 
during Year 2 are $6,000 and the LIFO value of B's Year 2 layer of 
increment is $600.
    (b) Intercompany inventory income. Under paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of 
this section, S must use a reasonable method of allocating its LIFO 
inventory costs to intercompany transactions. Because S has an inventory 
increment for Year 2 and uses the earliest acquisitions cost method, a 
reasonable method of determining its intercompany cost of goods sold for 
product Q is to use its most recent costs. Thus, its intercompany cost 
of goods sold is $800 ($8.00 most recent cost, multiplied by 100 units 
sold to B), and its intercompany inventory income is $350 ($1,150 sales 
proceeds from B minus $800 cost).
    (c) Timing. (i) Under the increment averaging method of paragraph 
(e)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, $35 of S's $350 of intercompany inventory 
income is not taken into account in Year 2, computed as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JY95.002

    (ii) Thus, $315 of S's intercompany inventory income is taken into 
account in Year 2 ($350 of total intercompany inventory income minus $35 
not taken into account).
    (d) S incurs a decrement. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) 
of this Example 1, except that in Year 2, S incurs a decrement equal to 
50% of its Year 1 layer. Under paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section, S 
must reasonably allocate the LIFO cost of the decrement to the cost of 
goods sold to B to determine S's intercompany inventory income.
    (e) B incurs a decrement. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) 
of this Example 1, except that B incurs a decrement in Year 2. S must 
take into account the entire $350 of

[[Page 284]]

Year 2 intercompany inventory income because all 100 units of product Q 
are deemed sold by B in Year 2.
    Example 2. Increment valuation method. (a) The facts are the same as 
in Example 1. In addition, B's use of the earliest acquisition's cost 
method of valuing its increments results in B valuing its year-end 
inventory using costs incurred from January through March. B's costs 
incurred during the year are: $1,428 in the period January through 
March; $1,498 in the period April through June; $1,524 in the period 
July through September; and $1,550 in the period October through 
December. S's intercompany inventory income for these periods is: $50 in 
the period January through March ((25x$10)-(25x$8)); $100 in the period 
April through June ((25x$12)-(25x$8)); $100 in the period July through 
September ((25x$12)-(25x$8)); and $100 in the period October through 
December ((25x$12)-(25x$8)).
    (b) Timing. (i) Under the increment valuation method of paragraph 
(e)(1)(ii)(C) of this section, $21 of S's $350 of intercompany inventory 
income is not taken into account in Year 2, computed as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JY95.003

    (ii) Thus, $329 of S's intercompany inventory income is taken into 
account in Year 2 ($350 of total intercompany inventory income minus $21 
not taken into account).
    (c) B incurs a subsequent decrement. The facts are the same as in 
paragraph (a) of this Example 2. In addition, assume that in Year 3, B 
experiences a decrement in its pool that receives intercompany purchases 
from S. B's decrement equals 20% of the base-year costs for its Year 2 
layer. The fact that B has incurred a decrement means that all of its 
inventory costs incurred for Year 3 are included in cost of goods sold. 
As a result, S takes into account its entire amount of intercompany 
inventory income from its Year 3 sales. In addition, S takes into 
account $4.20 of its Year 2 layer of intercompany inventory income not 
already taken into account (20% of $21).
    Example 3. Other reasonable inventory methods. (a) Facts. Both S and 
B use a dollar-value LIFO inventory method for their inventory 
transactions. During Year 1, S sells inventory to B and to X. Under 
paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section, to compute its intercompany 
inventory income and the amount of this income not taken into account, S 
computes its intercompany inventory income using the transfer price of 
the inventory items less a FIFO cost for the goods, takes into account 
these items based on a FIFO cost flow assumption for B's corresponding 
items, and the LIFO methods used by S and B are ignored for these 
computations. These computations are comparable to the methods used by S 
and B for financial reporting purposes, and the book methods and results 
are used for tax purposes. S adjusts the amount of intercompany 
inventory items not taken into account as required by section 263A.
    (b) Reasonable method. The method used by S is a reasonable method 
under paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section if the cumulative amount of 
intercompany inventory items not taken into account by S is not 
significantly greater than the cumulative amount that would not be taken 
into account under the methods specifically described in paragraph 
(e)(1) of this section. If, for any year, the method results in a 
cumulative amount of intercompany inventory items not taken into account 
by S that significantly exceeds the cumulative amount that would not be 
taken into account under the methods specifically provided, S must take 
into account for that year the amount necessary to eliminate the excess. 
The method is thereafter applied with appropriate adjustments to reflect 
the amount taken into account (e.g., to prevent the amount from being 
taken into account more than once).

    (2) Reserve accounting--(i) Banks and thrifts. Except as provided in 
paragraph (g)(3)(iv) of this section (deferral of items from an 
intercompany obligation), a member's addition to, or reduction of, a 
reserve for bad debts that is

[[Page 285]]

maintained under section 585 or 593 is taken into account on a separate 
entity basis. For example, if S makes a loan to a nonmember and 
subsequently sells the loan to B, any deduction for an addition to a bad 
debt reserve under section 585 and any recapture income (or reduced bad 
debt deductions) are taken into account on a separate entity basis 
rather than as intercompany items or corresponding items taken into 
account under this section. Any gain or loss of S from its sale of the 
loan to B is taken into account under this section, however, to the 
extent it is not attributable to recapture of the reserve.
    (ii) Insurance companies--(A) Direct insurance. If a member provides 
insurance to another member in an intercompany transaction, the 
transaction is taken into account by both members on a separate entity 
basis. For example, if one member provides life insurance coverage for 
another member with respect to its employees, the premiums, reserve 
increases and decreases, and death benefit payments are determined and 
taken into account by both members on a separate entity basis rather 
than taken into account under this section as intercompany items and 
corresponding items.
    (B) Reinsurance--(1) In general. Paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(A) of this 
section does not apply to a reinsurance transaction that is an 
intercompany transaction. For example, if a member assumes all or a 
portion of the risk on an insurance contract written by another member, 
the amounts transferred as reinsurance premiums, expense allowances, 
benefit reimbursements, reimbursed policyholder dividends, experience 
rating adjustments, and other similar items are taken into account under 
the matching rule and the acceleration rule. For purposes of this 
section, the assuming company is treated as B and the ceding company is 
treated as S.
    (2) Reserves determined on a separate entity basis. For purposes of 
determining the amount of a member's increase or decrease in reserves, 
the amount of any reserve item listed in section 807(c) or 832(b)(5) 
resulting from a reinsurance transaction that is an intercompany 
transaction is determined on a separate entity basis. But see section 
845, under which the Commissioner may allocate between or among the 
members any items, recharacterize any such items, or make any other 
adjustments necessary to reflect the proper source and character of the 
separate taxable income of a member.
    (3) Consent to treat intercompany transactions on a separate entity 
basis--(i) General rule. The common parent may request consent to take 
into account on a separate entity basis items from intercompany 
transactions other than intercompany transactions with respect to stock 
or obligations of members. Consent may be granted for all items, or for 
items from a class or classes of transactions. The consent is effective 
only if granted in writing by the Internal Revenue Service. Unless 
revoked with the written consent of the Internal Revenue Service, the 
separate entity treatment applies to all affected intercompany 
transactions in the consolidated return year for which consent is 
granted and in all subsequent consolidated return years. Consent under 
this paragraph (e)(3) does not apply for purposes of taking into account 
losses and deductions deferred under section 267(f).
    (ii) Time and manner for requesting consent. The request for consent 
described in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section must be made in the 
form of a ruling request. The request must be signed by the common 
parent, include any information required by the Internal Revenue 
Service, and be filed on or before the due date of the consolidated 
return (not including extensions of time) for the first consolidated 
return year to which the consent is to apply. The Internal Revenue 
Service may impose terms and conditions for granting consent. A copy of 
the consent must be attached to the group's consolidated returns (or 
amended returns) as required by the terms of the consent.
    (iii) Effect of consent on methods of accounting. A consent for 
separate entity accounting under this paragraph (e)(3), and a revocation 
of that consent, may require changes in members' methods of accounting 
for intercompany transactions. Because the consent, or a revocation of 
the consent, is effective for

[[Page 286]]

all intercompany transactions occurring in the consolidated return year 
for which the consent or revocation is first effective, any change in 
method is effected on a cut-off basis. Section 446(e) consent is granted 
for any changes in methods of accounting for intercompany transactions 
that are necessary solely to conform a member's methods to a binding 
consent with respect to the group under this paragraph (e)(3) or the 
revocation of that consent, provided the changes are made in the first 
consolidated return year for which the consent or revocation under this 
paragraph (e)(3) is effective. Therefore, section 446(e) consent must be 
separately requested under applicable administrative procedures if a 
member has failed to conform its practices to the separate entity 
accounting provided under this paragraph (e)(3) or the revocation of 
that treatment in the first consolidated return year for which the 
consent to use separate entity accounting or revocation of that consent 
is effective.
    (iv) Consent to treat intercompany transactions on a separate entity 
basis under prior law. A group that has received consent that is in 
effect as of the first day of the first consolidated return year 
beginning on or after July 12, 1995 to treat certain intercompany 
transactions as provided in Sec. 1.1502-13(c)(3) of the regulations (as 
contained in the 26 CFR part 1 edition revised as of April 1, 1995) will 
be considered to have obtained the consent of the Commissioner to take 
items from intercompany transactions into account on a separate entity 
basis as provided in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section. This treatment 
is applicable only to the items, class or classes of transactions for 
which consent was granted under prior law.
    (f) Stock of members--(1) In general. In addition to the general 
rules of this section, the rules of this paragraph (f) apply to stock of 
members.
    (2) Intercompany distributions to which section 301 applies--(i) In 
general. This paragraph (f)(2) provides rules for intercompany 
transactions to which section 301 applies (intercompany distributions). 
For purposes of determining whether a distribution is an intercompany 
distribution, it is treated as occurring under the principles of the 
entitlement rule of paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of this section. A distribution 
is not an intercompany distribution to the extent it is deducted by the 
distributing member. See, for example, section 1382(c)(1).
    (ii) Distributee member. An intercompany distribution is not 
included in the gross income of the distributee member (B). However, 
this exclusion applies to a distribution only to the extent there is a 
corresponding negative adjustment reflected under Sec. 1.1502-32 in B's 
basis in the stock of the distributing member (S). For example, no 
amount is included in B's gross income under section 301(c)(3) from a 
distribution in excess of the basis of the stock of a subsidiary that 
results in an excess loss account under Sec. 1.1502-32(a) which is 
treated as negative basis under Sec. 1.1502-19. B's dividend received 
deduction under section 243(a)(3) is determined without regard to any 
intercompany distributions under this paragraph (f)(2) to the extent 
they are not included in gross income. See Sec. 1.1502-26(b) 
(applicability of the dividends received deduction to distributions not 
excluded from gross income, such as a distribution from the common 
parent to a subsidiary owning stock of the common parent).
    (iii) Distributing member. The principles of section 311(b) apply to 
S's loss, as well as gain, from an intercompany distribution of 
property. Thus, S's loss is taken into account under the matching rule 
if the property is subsequently sold to a nonmember. However, section 
311(a) continues to apply to distributions to nonmembers (for example, 
loss is not recognized).
    (iv) Entitlement rule--(A) In general. For all Federal income tax 
purposes, an intercompany distribution is treated as taken into account 
when the shareholding member becomes entitled to it (generally on the 
record date). For example, if B becomes entitled to a cash distribution 
before it is made, the distribution is treated as made when B becomes 
entitled to it. For this purpose, B is treated as entitled to a 
distribution no later than the time the distribution is taken into 
account under the Internal Revenue Code (e.g., under section 305(c)). To 
the extent a

[[Page 287]]

distribution is not made, appropriate adjustments must be made as of the 
date it was taken into account.
    (B) Nonmember shareholders. If nonmembers own stock of the 
distributing corporation at the time the distribution is treated as 
occurring under this paragraph (f)(2)(iv), appropriate adjustments must 
be made to prevent the acceleration of the distribution to members from 
affecting distributions to nonmembers.
    (3) Boot in an intercompany reorganization--(i) Scope. This 
paragraph (f)(3) provides additional rules for an intercompany 
transaction in which the receipt of money or other property 
(nonqualifying property) results in the application of section 356. For 
example, the distribution of stock of a lower-tier member to a higher-
tier member in an intercompany transaction to which section 355 would 
apply but for the receipt of nonqualifying property is a transaction to 
which this paragraph (f)(3) applies. This paragraph (f)(3) does not 
apply if a party to the transaction becomes a member or nonmember as 
part of the same plan or arrangement. For example, if S merges into a 
nonmember in a transaction described in section 368(a)(1)(A), this 
paragraph (f)(3) does not apply.
    (ii) Treatment. Nonqualifying property received as part of a 
transaction described in this paragraph (f)(3) is treated as received by 
the member shareholder in a separate transaction. See, for example, 
sections 302 and 311 (rather than sections 356 and 361). The 
nonqualifying property is treated as taken into account immediately 
after the transaction if section 354 would apply but for the fact that 
nonqualifying property is received. It is treated as taken into account 
immediately before the transaction if section 355 would apply but for 
the fact that nonqualifying property is received. The treatment under 
this paragraph (f)(3)(ii) applies for all Federal income tax purposes.
    (4) Acquisition by issuer of its own stock. If a member acquires its 
own stock, or an option to buy or sell its own stock, in an intercompany 
transaction, the member's basis in that stock or option is treated as 
eliminated for all purposes. Accordingly, S's intercompany items from 
the stock or options of B are taken into account under this section if B 
acquires the stock or options in an intercompany transaction (unless, 
for example, B acquires the stock in exchange for successor property 
within the meaning of paragraph (j)(1) of this section in a 
nonrecognition transaction). For example, if B redeems its stock from S 
in a transaction to which section 302(a) applies, S's gain from the 
transaction is taken into account immediately under the acceleration 
rule.
    (5) Certain liquidations and distributions--(i) Netting allowed. S's 
intercompany item from a transfer to B of the stock of another 
corporation (T) is taken into account under this section in certain 
circumstances even though the T stock is never held by a nonmember after 
the intercompany transaction. For example, if S sells all of T's stock 
to B at a gain, and T subsequently liquidates into B in a separate 
transaction to which section 332 applies, S's gain is taken into account 
under the matching rule. Under paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section, S's 
intercompany gain taken into account as a result of a liquidation under 
section 332 or a comparable nonrecognition transaction is not 
redetermined to be excluded from gross income. Under this paragraph 
(f)(5)(i), if S has both intercompany income or gain and intercompany 
deduction or loss attributable to stock of the same corporation having 
the same material terms, only the income or gain in excess of the 
deduction or loss is subject to paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section. 
This paragraph (f)(5)(i) applies only to a transaction in which B's 
basis in its T stock is permanently eliminated in a liquidation under 
section 332 or any comparable nonrecognition transaction, including--
    (A) A merger of B into T under section 368(a);
    (B) A distribution by B of its T stock in a transaction described in 
section 355; or
    (C) A deemed liquidation of T resulting from an election under 
section 338(h)(10).
    (ii) Elective relief--(A) In general. If an election is made 
pursuant to this paragraph (f)(5)(ii), certain transactions are

[[Page 288]]

recharacterized to prevent S's items from being taken into account or to 
provide offsets to those items. This paragraph (f)(5)(ii) applies only 
if T is a member throughout the period beginning with S's transfer and 
ending with the completion of the nonrecognition transaction.
    (B) Section 332--(1) In general. If section 332 applies to T's 
liquidation into B, and B transfers T's assets to a new member (new T) 
in a transaction not otherwise pursuant to the same plan or arrangement 
as the liquidation, the transfer is nevertheless treated for all Federal 
income tax purposes as pursuant to the same plan or arrangement as the 
liquidation. For example, if T liquidates into B, but B forms new T by 
transferring substantially all of T's former assets to new T, S's 
intercompany gain or loss generally is not taken into account solely as 
a result of the liquidation if the liquidation and transfer would 
qualify as a reorganization described in section 368(a). (Under 
paragraph (j)(1) of this section, B's stock in new T would be a 
successor asset to B's stock in T, and S's gain would be taken into 
account based on the new T stock.)
    (2) Time limitation and adjustments. The transfer of an asset to new 
T not otherwise pursuant to the same plan or arrangement as the 
liquidation is treated under this paragraph (f)(5)(ii)(B) as pursuant to 
the same plan or arrangement only if B transfers it to new T pursuant to 
a written plan, a copy of which is attached to a timely filed original 
return (including extensions) for the year of T's liquidation, and the 
transfer is completed within 12 months of the filing of that return. 
Appropriate adjustments are made to reflect any events occurring before 
the formation of new T and to reflect any assets not transferred to new 
T as part of the same plan or arrangement. For example, if B retains an 
asset in the reorganization, the asset is treated under paragraph (f)(3) 
of this section as acquired by new T but distributed to B immediately 
after the reorganization.
    (3) Downstream merger, etc. The principles of this paragraph 
(f)(5)(ii)(B) apply, with appropriate adjustments, if B's basis in the T 
stock is eliminated in a transaction similar to a section 332 
liquidation, such as a transaction described in section 368 in which B 
merges into T. For example, if S and B are subsidiaries, and S sells all 
of T's stock to B at a gain followed by B's merger into T in a separate 
transaction described in section 368(a), S's gain is not taken into 
account solely as a result of the merger if T (as successor to B) forms 
new T with substantially all of T's former assets.
    (C) Section 338(h)(10)--(1) In general. This paragraph (f)(5)(ii)(C) 
applies to a deemed liquidation of T under section 332 as the result of 
an election under section 338(h)(10). This paragraph (f)(5)(ii)(C) does 
not apply if paragraph (f)(5)(ii)(B) of this section is applied to the 
deemed liquidation. Under this paragraph, B is treated with respect to 
each share of its T stock as recognizing as a corresponding item any 
loss or deduction it would recognize (determined after adjusting stock 
basis under Sec. 1.1502-32) if section 331 applied to the deemed 
liquidation. For all other Federal income tax purposes, the deemed 
liquidation remains subject to section 332.
    (2) Limitation on amount of loss. The amount of B's loss or 
deduction under this paragraph (f)(5)(ii)(C) is limited as follows--
    (i) The aggregate amount of loss recognized with respect to T stock 
cannot exceed the amount of S's intercompany income or gain that is in 
excess of S's intercompany deduction or loss with respect to shares of T 
stock having the same material terms as the shares giving rise to S's 
intercompany income or gain; and
    (ii) The aggregate amount of loss recognized under this paragraph 
(f)(5)(ii)(C) from T's deemed liquidation cannot exceed the net amount 
of deduction or loss (if any) that would be taken into account from the 
deemed liquidation if section 331 applied with respect to all T shares.
    (3) Asset sale, etc. The principles of this paragraph (f)(5)(ii)(C) 
apply, with appropriate adjustments, if T transfers all of its assets to 
a nonmember and completely liquidates in a transaction comparable to the 
section 338(h)(10) transaction described in paragraph (f)(5)(ii)(C)(1) 
of this section. For example, if S sells all of T's stock to B at a

[[Page 289]]

gain followed by T's merger into a nonmember in exchange for a cash 
payment to B in a transaction treated for Federal income tax purposes as 
T's sale of its assets to the nonmember and complete liquidation, the 
merger is ordinarily treated as a comparable transaction.
    (D) Section 355. If B distributes the T stock in an intercompany 
transaction to which section 355 applies (including an intercompany 
transaction to which 355 applies because of the application of paragraph 
(f)(3) of this section), the redetermination of the basis of the T stock 
under section 358 could cause S's gain or loss to be taken into account 
under this section. This paragraph (f)(5)(ii)(D) applies to treat B's 
distribution as subject to sections 301 and 311 (as modified by this 
paragraph (f)), rather than section 355. The election will prevent S's 
gain or loss from being taken into account immediately to the extent 
matching remains possible, but B's gain or loss from the distribution 
will also be taken into account under this section.
    (E) Election. An election to apply this paragraph (f)(5)(ii) is made 
in a separate statement entitled ``[Insert Name and Employer 
Identification Number of Common Parent] HEREBY ELECTS THE APPLICATION OF 
Sec. 1.1502-13(f)(5)(ii).'' The election must include a description of 
S's intercompany transaction and T's liquidation (or other transaction). 
It must specify which provision of Sec. 1.1502-13(f)(5)(ii) applies and 
how it alters the otherwise applicable results under this section 
(including, for example, the amount of S's intercompany items and the 
amount deferred or offset as a result of this Sec. 1.1502-
13(f)(5)(ii)). A separate election must be made for each application of 
this paragraph (f)(5)(ii). The election must be signed by the common 
parent and filed with the group's income tax return for the year of T's 
liquidation (or other transaction). The Commissioner may impose 
reasonable terms and conditions to the application of this paragraph 
(f)(5)(ii) that are consistent with the purposes of this section.
    (6) Stock of common parent. In addition to the general rules of this 
section, this paragraph (f)(6) applies to parent stock (P stock) and 
positions in P stock held or entered into by another member. For this 
purpose, P stock is any stock of the common parent held (directly or 
indirectly) by another member or any stock of a member (the issuer) that 
was the common parent if the stock was held (directly or indirectly) by 
another member while the issuer was the common parent.
    (i) Loss stock--(A) Recognized loss. Any loss recognized, directly 
or indirectly, by a member with respect to P stock is permanently 
disallowed and does not reduce earnings and profits. See Sec. 1.1502-
32(b)(3)(iii)(A) for a corresponding reduction in the basis of the 
member's stock.
    (B) Other cases. If a member, M, owns P stock, the stock is 
subsequently owned by a nonmember, and, immediately before the stock is 
owned by the nonmember, M's basis in the share exceeds its fair market 
value, then, to the extent paragraph (f)(6)(i)(A) of this section does 
not apply, M's basis in the share is reduced to the share's fair market 
value immediately before the share is held by the nonmember. For 
example, if M owns shares of P stock with a $100x basis and M becomes a 
nonmember at a time when the P shares have a value of $60x, M's basis in 
the P shares is reduced to $60x immediately before M becomes a 
nonmember. Similarly, if M contributes the P stock to a nonmember in a 
transaction subject to section 351, M's basis in the shares is reduced 
to $60x immediately before the contribution. See Sec. 1.1502-
32(b)(3)(iii)(B) for a corresponding reduction in the basis of M's 
stock.
    (C) Waiver of built-in loss on P stock--(1) In general. If a 
nonmember that owns P stock with a basis in excess of its fair market 
value becomes a member of the P consolidated group in a qualifying cost 
basis transaction, the group may make an irrevocable election to reduce 
the basis of the P stock to its fair market value immediately before the 
nonmember becomes a member of the P group. If the nonmember was a member 
of another consolidated group immediately before becoming a member of 
the P group, the reduction in basis is treated as occurring immediately 
after it ceases to be a member

[[Page 290]]

of the prior group. A qualifying cost basis transaction is the purchase 
(i.e., a transaction in which basis is determined under section 1012) by 
members of the P consolidated group (while they are members) in a 12-
month period of an amount of the nonmember's stock satisfying the 
requirements of section 1504(a)(2).
    (2) Election. The election described in this paragraph (6)(i)(C) 
must be made in a separate statement entitled ``ELECTION TO REDUCE BASIS 
OF P STOCK UNDER Sec. 1.1502-13(f)(6).'' The statement must be filed 
with the P consolidated group's return for the year in which the 
nonmember becomes a member, and it must be signed by both P and the 
nonmember. The statement must identify the fair market value of, and the 
amount of the basis reduction in, the P stock.
    (ii) Gain stock. If a member, M, would otherwise recognize gain on a 
qualified disposition of P stock, then immediately before the qualified 
disposition, M is treated as purchasing the P stock from P for fair 
market value with cash contributed to M by P (or, if necessary, through 
any intermediate members). A disposition is a qualified disposition only 
if--
    (A) The member acquires the P stock directly from the common parent 
(P) through a contribution to capital or a transaction qualifying under 
section 351(a) (or, if necessary, through a series of such transactions 
involving only members);
    (B) Pursuant to a plan, the member transfers the stock immediately 
to a nonmember that is not related, within the meaning of section 267(b) 
or 707(b), to any member of the group;
    (C) No nonmember receives a substituted basis in the stock within 
the meaning of section 7701(a)(42);
    (D) The P stock is not exchanged for P stock;
    (E) P neither becomes nor ceases to be the common parent as part of, 
or in contemplation of, the disposition or plan; and
    (F) M is neither a nonmember that becomes a member nor a member that 
becomes a nonmember as part of, or in contemplation of, the disposition 
or plan.
    (iii) Mark-to-market of P stock. Paragraphs (f)(6)(i) and (ii) of 
this section shall not apply to any gain or loss from a share of P stock 
held by a member, M, if--
    (A) M regularly trades in P stock (of the same class) with customers 
in the ordinary course of its business as a dealer;
    (B) The gain or loss on the share is taken into account by M 
pursuant to section 475(a);
    (C) M's basis in the share is not adjusted by reference to the basis 
of any other property or by reference to income, gain, deduction, or 
loss from other property; and
    (D) Neither M nor any other member of the group has structured or 
engaged in any transaction while a member (or in anticipation of 
becoming a member), during the taxable year or in any year within the 
preceding five taxable years that is open for assessment under section 
6501, with a principal purpose of avoiding gain or creating loss on P 
stock subject to section 475(a).
    (iv) Options, warrants, and other positions--(A) In general. This 
paragraph (f)(6) applies with appropriate adjustments to positions in P 
stock to the extent that P's gain or loss from an equivalent position 
would not be recognized under section 1032. Thus, if M purchases an 
option to buy or sell P stock and sells the option at a loss, the loss 
is permanently disallowed under paragraph (f)(6)(i)(A) of this section. 
Similarly, if M is the grantor of such an option and becomes a 
nonmember, then the principles of paragraph (f)(6)(i)(B) of this section 
apply to the extent that M would recognize loss from cash settlement of 
the option at its fair market value immediately before M becomes a 
nonmember, and proper adjustments must be made in the amount of any gain 
or loss subsequently realized from the position by M. If P grants M an 
option to acquire P stock in a transaction meeting the requirements of 
paragraph (f)(6)(ii) of this section, M is treated as having purchased 
the option from P for fair market value with cash contributed to M by P.
    (B) Mark-to-market of positions in P stock. For purposes of 
paragraph (f)(6)(iii) of this section, gain or loss

[[Page 291]]

with respect to a position taken into account under section 1256(a) is 
treated as taken into account under section 475(a) to the extent that 
the gain or loss would be taken into account under the principles of 
section 475.
    (v) Effective date. This paragraph (f)(6) applies to gain or loss 
taken into account on or after July 12, 1995, and to transactions 
occurring on or after July 12, 1995. However, paragraph (f)(6)(ii) of 
this section and the last sentence of paragraph (f)(6)(iv)(A) of this 
section do not apply to dispositions of P stock or options occurring on 
or after May 16, 2000. For example, if S sells P stock to B at a loss 
prior to July 12, 1995, and B sells the P stock to a nonmember after 
July 12, 1995, S's loss is disallowed because it is taken into account 
after July 12, 1995. If a taxpayer takes a gain or loss into account or 
engages in a transaction on or after July 12, 1995, during a tax year 
ending prior to December 31, 1995, the taxpayer may treat the gain or 
loss or the transaction under the rules published in 1995-32 I.R.B. 47, 
instead of under the rules of this paragraph (f)(6).
    (7) Examples. The application of this section to intercompany 
transactions with respect to stock of members is illustrated by the 
following examples.

    Example 1. Dividend exclusion and property distribution. (a) Facts. 
S owns land with a $70 basis and $100 value. On January 1 of Year 1, P's 
basis in S's stock is $100. During Year 1, S declares and makes a 
dividend distribution of the land to P. Under section 311(b), S has a 
$30 gain. Under section 301(d), P's basis in the land is $100. On July 1 
of Year 3, P sells the land to X for $110.
    (b) Dividend elimination and stock basis adjustments. Under 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, S's distribution to P is an 
intercompany distribution. Under paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, 
P's $100 of dividend income is not included in gross income. Under Sec. 
1.1502-32, P's basis in S's stock is reduced from $100 to $0 in Year 1.
    (c) Matching rule and stock basis adjustments. Under the matching 
rule (treating P as the buying member and S as the selling member), S 
takes its $30 gain into account in Year 3 to reflect the $30 difference 
between P's $10 gain taken into account and the $40 recomputed gain. 
Under Sec. 1.1502-32, P's basis in S's stock is increased from $0 to 
$30 in Year 3.
    (d) Loss property. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of 
this Example 1, except that S has a $130 (rather than $70) basis in the 
land. Under paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section, the principles of 
section 311(b) apply to S's loss from the intercompany distribution. 
Thus, S has a $30 loss that is taken into account under the matching 
rule in Year 3 to reflect the $30 difference between P's $10 gain taken 
into account and the $20 recomputed loss. (The results are the same 
under section 267(f).) Under Sec. 1.1502-32, P's basis in S's stock is 
reduced from $100 to $0 in Year 1, and from $0 to a $30 excess loss 
account in Year 3. (If P had distributed the land to its shareholders, 
rather than selling the land to X, P would take its $10 gain under 
section 311(b) into account, and S would take its $30 loss into account 
under the matching rule with $10 offset by P's gain and $20 
recharacterized as a noncapital, nondeductible amount.)
    (e) Entitlement rule. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of 
this Example 1, except that, after P becomes entitled to the 
distribution but before the distribution is made, S issues additional 
stock to the public and becomes a nonmember. Under paragraph (f)(2)(i) 
of this section, the determination of whether a distribution is an 
intercompany distribution is made under the entitlement rule of 
paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of this section. Treating S's distribution as made 
when P becomes entitled to it results in the distribution being an 
intercompany distribution. Under paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, 
the distribution is not included in P's gross income. S's $30 gain from 
the distribution is intercompany gain that is taken into account under 
the acceleration rule immediately before S becomes a nonmember. Thus, 
there is a net $70 decrease in P's basis in its S stock under Sec. 
1.1502-32 ($100 decrease for the distribution and a $30 increase for S's 
$30 gain). Under paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of this section, P does not take 
the distribution into account again under separate return rules when 
received, and P is not entitled to a dividends received deduction.
    Example 2. Excess loss accounts. (a) Facts. S owns all of T's only 
class of stock with a $10 basis and $100 value. S has substantial 
earnings and profits, and T has $10 of earnings and profits. On January 
1 of Year 1, S declares and distributes a dividend of all of the T stock 
to P. Under section 311(b), S has a $90 gain. Under section 301(d), P's 
basis in the T stock is $100. During Year 3, T borrows $90 and declares 
and makes a $90 distribution to P to which section 301 applies, and P's 
basis in the T stock is reduced under Sec. 1.1502-32 from $100 to $10. 
During Year 6, T has $5 of earnings that increase P's basis in the T 
stock under Sec. 1.1502-32 from $10 to $15. On December 1 of Year 9, T 
issues additional stock to X and, as a result, T becomes a nonmember.
    (b) Dividend exclusion. Under paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, 
P's $100 of dividend income from S's distribution of the T stock, and 
its $10 of dividend income from T's $90

[[Page 292]]

distribution, are not included in gross income.
    (c) Matching and acceleration rules. Under Sec. 1.1502-19(b)(1), 
when T becomes a nonmember P must include in income the amount of its 
excess loss account (if any) in T stock. P has no excess loss account in 
the T stock. Therefore P's corresponding item from the deconsolidation 
of T is $0. Treating S and P as divisions of a single corporation, the T 
stock would continue to have a $10 basis after the distribution, and the 
adjustments under Sec. 1.1502-32 for T's $90 distribution and $5 of 
earnings would result in a $75 excess loss account. Thus, the recomputed 
corresponding item from the deconsolidation is $75. Under the matching 
rule, S takes $75 of its $90 gain into account in Year 9 as a result of 
T becoming a nonmember, to reflect the difference between P's $0 gain 
taken into account and the $75 recomputed gain. S's remaining $15 of 
gain is taken into account under the matching and acceleration rules 
based on subsequent events (for example, under the matching rule if P 
subsequently sells its T stock, or under the acceleration rule if S 
becomes a nonmember).
    (d) Reverse sequence. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of 
this Example 2, except that T borrows $90 and makes its $90 distribution 
to S before S distributes T's stock to P. Under paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of 
this section, T's $90 distribution to S ($10 of which is a dividend) is 
not included in S's gross income. The corresponding negative adjustment 
under Sec. 1.1502-32 reduces S's basis in the T stock from $10 to an 
$80 excess loss account. Under section 311(b), S has a $90 gain from the 
distribution of T stock to P. Under section 301(d) P's initial basis in 
the T stock is $10 (the stock's fair market value), and the basis 
increases to $15 under Sec. 1.1502-32 as a result of T's earnings in 
Year 6. The timing and attributes of S's gain are determined in the 
manner provided in paragraph (c) of this Example 2. Thus, $75 of S's 
gain is taken into account under the matching rule in Year 9 as a result 
of T becoming a nonmember, and the remaining $15 is taken into account 
under the matching and acceleration rules based on subsequent events.
    (e) Partial stock sale. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) 
of this Example 2, except that P sells 10% of T's stock to X on December 
1 of Year 9 for $1.50 (rather than T's issuing additional stock and 
becoming a nonmember). Under the matching rule, S takes $9 of its gain 
into account to reflect the difference between P's $0 gain taken into 
account ($1.50 sale proceeds minus $1.50 basis) and the $9 recomputed 
gain ($1.50 sale proceeds plus $7.50 excess loss account).
    (f) Loss, rather than cash distribution. The facts are the same as 
in paragraph (a) of this Example 2, except that T retains the loan 
proceeds and incurs a $90 loss in Year 3 that is absorbed by the group. 
The timing and attributes of S's gain are determined in the same manner 
provided in paragraph (c) of this Example 2. Under Sec. 1.1502-32, the 
loss in Year 3 reduces P's basis in the T stock from $100 to $10, and 
T's $5 of earnings in Year 6 increase the basis to $15. Thus, $75 of S's 
gain is taken into account under the matching rule in Year 9 as a result 
of T becoming a nonmember, and the remaining $15 is taken into account 
under the matching and acceleration rules based on subsequent events. 
(The timing and attributes of S's gain would be determined in the same 
manner provided in paragraph (d) of this Example 2 if T incurred the $90 
loss before S's distribution of the T stock to P.)
    (g) Stock sale, rather than stock distribution. The facts are the 
same as in paragraph (a) of this Example 2, except that S sells the T 
stock to P for $100 (rather than distributing the stock). The timing and 
attributes of S's gain are determined in the same manner provided in 
paragraph (c) of this Example 2. Thus, $75 of S's gain is taken into 
account under the matching rule in Year 9 as a result of T becoming a 
nonmember, and the remaining $15 is taken into account under the 
matching and acceleration rules based on subsequent events.
    Example 3. Intercompany reorganization. (a) Facts. P forms S and B 
by contributing $200 to the capital of each. During Years 1 through 4, S 
and B each earn $50, and under Sec. 1.1502-32 P adjusts its basis in 
the stock of each to $250. (See Sec. 1.1502-33 for adjustments to 
earnings and profits.) On January 1 of Year 5, the fair market value of 
S's assets and its stock is $500, and S merges into B in a tax-free 
reorganization. Pursuant to the plan of reorganization, P receives B 
stock with a fair market value of $350 and $150 of cash.
    (b) Treatment as a section 301 distribution. The merger of S into B 
is a transaction to which paragraph (f)(3) of this section applies. P is 
treated as receiving additional B stock with a fair market value of $500 
and, under section 358, a basis of $250. Immediately after the merger, 
$150 of the stock received is treated as redeemed, and the redemption is 
treated under section 302(d) as a distribution to which section 301 
applies. Because the $150 distribution is treated as not received as 
part of the merger, section 356 does not apply and no basis adjustments 
are required under section 358(a)(1)(A) and (B). Because B is treated 
under section 381(c)(2) as receiving S's earnings and profits and the 
redemption is treated as occurring after the merger, $100 of the 
distribution is treated as a dividend under section 301 and P's basis in 
the B stock is reduced correspondingly under Sec. 1.1502-32. The 
remaining $50 of the distribution reduces P's basis in the B stock. 
Section 301(c)(2) and Sec. 1.1502-32. Under paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of 
this section, P's $100 of dividend income is not included in gross 
income. Under Sec. 1.302-2(c),

[[Page 293]]

proper adjustments are made to P's basis in its B stock to reflect its 
basis in the B stock redeemed, with the result that P's basis in the B 
stock is reduced by the entire $150 distribution.
    (c) Depreciated property. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) 
of this Example 3, except that property of S with a $200 basis and $150 
fair market value is distributed to P (rather than cash of B). As in 
paragraph (b) of this Example 3, P is treated as receiving additional B 
stock in the merger and a $150 distribution to which section 301 applies 
immediately after the merger. Under paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this 
section, the principles of section 311(b) apply to B's $50 loss and the 
loss is taken into account under the matching and acceleration rules 
based on subsequent events (e.g., under the matching rule if P 
subsequently sells the property, or under the acceleration rule if B 
becomes a nonmember). The results are the same under section 267(f).
    (d) Divisive transaction. Assume instead that, pursuant to a plan, S 
distributes the stock of a lower-tier subsidiary in a spin-off 
transaction to which section 355 applies together with $150 of cash. The 
distribution of stock is a transaction to which paragraph (f)(3) of this 
section applies. P is treated as receiving the $150 of cash immediately 
before the section 355 distribution, as a distribution to which section 
301 applies. Section 356(b) does not apply and no basis adjustments are 
required under section 358(a)(1) (A) and (B). Because the $150 
distribution is treated as made before the section 355 distribution, the 
distribution reduces P's basis in the S stock under Sec. 1.1502-32, and 
the basis allocated under section 358(c) between the S stock and the 
lower-tier subsidiary stock received reflects this basis reduction.
    Example 4. Stock redemptions and distributions. (a) Facts. Before 
becoming a member of the P group, S owns P stock with a $30 basis. On 
January 1 of Year 1, P buys all of S's stock. On July 1 of Year 3, P 
redeems the P stock held by S for $100 in a transaction to which section 
302(a) applies.
    (b) Gain under section 302. Under paragraph (f)(4) of this section, 
P's basis in the P stock acquired from S is treated as eliminated. As a 
result of this elimination, S's intercompany item will never be taken 
into account under the matching rule because P's basis in the stock does 
not reflect S's intercompany item. Therefore, S's $70 gain is taken into 
account under the acceleration rule in Year 3. The attributes of S's 
item are determined under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section by 
applying the matching rule as if P had sold the stock to an affiliated 
corporation that is not a member of the group at no gain or loss. 
Although P's corresponding item from a sale of its stock would have been 
excluded from gross income under section 1032, paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of 
this section prevents S's gain from being treated as excluded from gross 
income; instead S's gain is capital gain.
    (c) Gain under section 311. The facts are the same as in paragraph 
(a) of this Example 4, except that S distributes the P stock to P in a 
transaction to which section 301 applies (rather than the stock being 
redeemed), and S has a $70 gain under section 311(b). The timing and 
attributes of S's gain are determined in the manner provided in 
paragraph (b) of this Example 4.
    (d) Loss stock. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this 
Example 4, except that S has a $130 (rather than $30) basis in the P 
stock and has a $30 loss under section 302(a). The limitation under 
paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section does not apply to intercompany 
losses. Thus, S's loss is taken into account in Year 3 as a noncapital, 
nondeductible amount.
    Example 5. Intercompany stock sale followed by section 332 
liquidation. (a) Facts. S owns all of the stock of T, with a $70 basis 
and $100 value, and T's assets have a $10 basis and $100 value. On 
January 1 of Year 1, S sells all of T's stock to B for $100. On July 1 
of Year 3, when T's assets are still worth $100, T distributes all of 
its assets to B in an unrelated complete liquidation to which section 
332 applies.
    (b) Timing and attributes. Under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this 
section, B's unrecognized gain or loss under section 332 is a 
corresponding item for purposes of applying the matching rule. In Year 3 
when T liquidates, B has $0 of unrecognized gain or loss under section 
332 because B has a $100 basis in the T stock and receives a $100 
distribution with respect to its T stock. Treating S and B as divisions 
of a single corporation, the recomputed corresponding item would have 
been $30 of unrecognized gain under section 332 because B would have 
succeeded to S's $70 basis in the T stock. Thus, under the matching 
rule, S's $30 intercompany gain is taken into account in Year 3 as a 
result of T's liquidation. Under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, 
the attributes of S's gain and B's corresponding item are redetermined 
as if S and B were divisions of a single corporation. Although S's gain 
ordinarily would be redetermined to be treated as excluded from gross 
income to reflect the nonrecognition of B's gain under section 332, S's 
gain remains capital gain because B's unrecognized gain under section 
332 is not permanently and explicitly disallowed under the Code. See 
paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section. However, relief may be elected 
under paragraph (f)(5)(ii) of this section.
    (c) Intercompany sale at a loss. The facts are the same as in 
paragraph (a) of this Example 5, except that S has a $130 (rather than 
$70) basis in the T stock. The limitation under paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of 
this section does not apply to intercompany losses. Thus, S's 
intercompany loss is taken into account in

[[Page 294]]

Year 3 as a noncapital, nondeductible amount. However, relief may be 
elected under paragraph (f)(5)(ii) of this section.
    Example 6. Intercompany stock sale followed by section 355 
distribution. (a) Facts. S owns all of the stock of T with a $70 basis 
and a $100 value. On January 1 of Year 1, S sells all of T's stock to M 
for $100. On June 1 of Year 6, M distributes all of its T stock to its 
nonmember shareholders in a transaction to which section 355 applies. At 
the time of the distribution, M has a basis in T stock of $100 and T has 
a value of $150.
    (b) Timing and attributes. Under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this 
section, M's $50 gain not recognized on the distribution under section 
355 is a corresponding item. Treating S and M as divisions of a single 
corporation, the recomputed corresponding item would be $80 of 
unrecognized gain under section 355 because M would have succeeded to 
S's $70 basis in the T stock. Thus, under the matching rule, S's $30 
intercompany gain is taken into account in Year 6 as a result of the 
distribution. Under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the attributes 
of S's intercompany item and M's corresponding item are redetermined to 
produce the same effect on consolidated taxable income as if S and M 
were divisions of a single corporation. Although S's gain ordinarily 
would be redetermined to be treated as excluded from gross income to 
reflect the nonrecognition of M's gain under section 355(c), S's gain 
remains capital gain because M's unrecognized gain under section 355(c) 
is not permanently and explicitly disallowed under the Code. See 
paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section. Because M's distribution of the T 
stock is not an intercompany transaction, relief is not available under 
paragraph (f)(5)(ii) of this section.
    (c) Section 355 distribution within the group. The facts are the 
same as under paragraph (a) of this Example 6, except that M distributes 
the T stock to B (another member of the group), and B takes a $75 basis 
in the T stock under section 358. Under paragraph (j)(2) of this 
section, B is a successor to M for purposes of taking S's intercompany 
gain into account, and therefore both M and B might have corresponding 
items with respect to S's intercompany gain. To the extent it is 
possible, matching with respect to B's corresponding items produces the 
result most consistent with treating S, M, and B as divisions of a 
single corporation. See paragraphs (j)(3) and (j)(4) of this section. 
However, because there is only $5 difference between B's $75 basis in 
the T stock and the $70 basis the stock would have if S, M, and B were 
divisions of a single corporation, only $5 can be taken into account 
under the matching rule with respect to B's corresponding items. (This 
$5 is taken into account with respect to B's corresponding items based 
on subsequent events.) The remaining $25 of S's $30 intercompany gain is 
taken into account in Year 6 under the matching rule with respect to M's 
corresponding item from its distribution of the T stock. The attributes 
of S's remaining $25 of gain are determined in the same manner as in 
paragraph (b) of this Example 6.
    (d) Relief elected. The facts are the same as in paragraph (c) of 
this Example 6 except that P elects relief pursuant to paragraph 
(f)(5)(ii)(D) of this section. As a result of the election, M's 
distribution of the T stock is treated as subject to sections 301 and 
311 instead of section 355. Accordingly, M recognizes $50 of 
intercompany gain from the distribution, B takes a basis in the stock 
equal to its fair market value of $150, and S and M take their 
intercompany gains into account with respect to B's corresponding items 
based on subsequent events. (None of S's gain is taken into account in 
Year 6 as a result of M's distribution of the T stock.)

    (g) Obligations of members--(1) In general. In addition to the 
general rules of this section, the rules of this paragraph (g) apply to 
intercompany obligations.
    (2) Definitions. For purposes of this section--
    (i) Obligation of a member. An obligation of a member is--
    (A) Any obligation of the member constituting indebtedness under 
general principles of Federal income tax law (for example, under 
nonstatutory authorities, or under section 108, section 163, section 
171, or section 1275), but not an executory obligation to purchase or 
provide goods or services; and
    (B) Any security of the member described in section 475(c)(2)(D) or 
(E), and any comparable security with respect to commodities, but not if 
the security is a position with respect to the member's stock. See 
paragraphs (f)(4) and (6) of this section for special rules applicable 
to positions with respect to a member's stock.
    (ii) Intercompany obligations. An intercompany obligation is an 
obligation between members, but only for the period during which both 
parties are members.
    (3) Deemed satisfaction and reissuance of intercompany obligations--
(i) Application--(A) In general. If a member realizes an amount (other 
than zero) of income, gain, deduction, or loss, directly or indirectly, 
from the assignment or extinguishment of all or part of its remaining 
rights or obligations under an intercompany obligation, the intercompany 
obligation is treated for all

[[Page 295]]

Federal income tax purposes as satisfied under paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of 
this section and, if it remains outstanding, reissued under paragraph 
(g)(3)(iii) of this section. Similar principles apply under this 
paragraph (g)(3) if a member realizes any such amount, directly or 
indirectly, from a comparable transaction (for example, a marking-to-
market of an obligation or a bad debt deduction), or if an intercompany 
obligation becomes an obligation that is not an intercompany obligation.
    (B) Exceptions. This paragraph (g)(3) does not apply to an 
obligation if any of the following applies:
    (1) The obligation became an intercompany obligation by reason of an 
event described in Sec. 1.108-2(e) (exceptions to the application of 
section 108(e)(4)).
    (2) The amount realized is from reserve accounting under section 585 
or section 593 (see paragraph (g)(3)(iv) of this section for special 
rules).
    (3) The amount realized is from the conversion of an obligation into 
stock of the obligor.
    (4) Treating the obligation as satisfied and reissued will not have 
a significant effect on any person's Federal income tax liability for 
any year. For this purpose, obligations issued in connection with the 
same transaction or related transactions are treated as a single 
obligation. However, this paragraph (g)(3)(i)(B)(4) does not apply to 
any obligation if the aggregate effect of this treatment for all 
obligations in a year would be significant.
    (ii) Satisfaction--(A) General rule. If a creditor member sells 
intercompany debt for cash, the debt is treated as satisfied by the 
debtor immediately before the sale for the amount of the cash. For other 
transactions, similar principles apply to treat the intercompany debt as 
satisfied immediately before the transaction. Thus, if the debt is 
transferred for property, it is treated as satisfied for an amount 
consistent with the amount for which the debt is deemed reissued under 
paragraph (g)(3)(iii) of this section, and the basis of the property is 
also adjusted to reflect that amount. If this paragraph (g)(3) applies 
because the debtor or creditor becomes a nonmember, the obligation is 
treated as satisfied for cash in an amount equal to its fair market 
value immediately before the debtor or creditor becomes a nonmember. 
Similar principles apply to intercompany obligations other than debt.
    (B) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1502-
13T(g)(3)(ii)(B).
    (iii) Reissuance. If a creditor member sells intercompany debt for 
cash, the debt is treated as a new debt (with a new holding period) 
issued by the debtor immediately after the sale for the amount of cash. 
For other transactions, if the intercompany debt remains outstanding, 
similar principles apply to treat the debt as reissued immediately after 
the transaction. Thus, if the debt is transferred for property, it is 
treated as new debt issued for the property. See, for example, section 
1273(b)(3) or section 1274. If this paragraph (g)(3) applies because the 
debtor or creditor becomes a nonmember, the debt is treated as new debt 
issued for an amount of cash equal to its fair market value immediately 
after the debtor or creditor becomes a nonmember. Similar principles 
apply to intercompany obligations other than debt.
    (iv) Bad debt reserve. A member's deduction under section 585 or 
section 593 for an addition to its reserve for bad debts with respect to 
an intercompany obligation is not taken into account, and is not treated 
as realized under this paragraph (g)(3) until the intercompany 
obligation becomes an obligation that is not an intercompany obligation, 
or, if earlier, the redemption or cancellation of the intercompany 
obligation.
    (4) Deemed satisfaction and reissuance of obligations becoming 
intercompany obligations--(i) Application--(A) In general. This 
paragraph (g)(4) applies if an obligation that is not an intercompany 
obligation becomes an intercompany obligation.
    (B) Exceptions. This paragraph (g)(4) does not apply to an 
obligation if--
    (1) The obligation becomes an intercompany obligation by reason of 
an event described in Sec. 1.108-2(e) (exceptions to the application of 
section 108(e)(4)); or
    (2) Treating the obligation as satisfied and reissued will not have 
a significant effect on any person's Federal

[[Page 296]]

income tax liability for any year. For this purpose, obligations issued 
in connection with the same transaction or related transactions are 
treated as a single obligation. However, this paragraph (g)(4)(i)(B)(2) 
does not apply to any obligation if the aggregate effect of this 
treatment for all obligations in a year would be significant.
    (ii) Intercompany debt. If this paragraph (g)(4) applies to an 
intercompany debt--
    (A) Section 108(e)(4) does not apply;
    (B) The debt is treated for all Federal income tax purposes, 
immediately after it becomes an intercompany debt, as satisfied and a 
new debt issued to the holder (with a new holding period) in an amount 
determined under the principles of Sec. 1.108-2(f);
    (C) The attributes of all items taken into account from the 
satisfaction are determined on a separate entity basis, rather than by 
treating S and B as divisions of a single corporation;
    (D) Any intercompany gain or loss taken into account is treated as 
not subject to section 354 or section 1091; and
    (E) Solely for purposes of Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(4) and the effect of 
any election under that provision, any loss taken into account under 
this paragraph (g)(4) by a corporation that becomes a member as a result 
of the transaction in which the obligation becomes an intercompany 
obligation is treated as a loss carryover from a separate return 
limitation year.
    (iii) Other intercompany obligations. If this paragraph (g)(4) 
applies to an intercompany obligation other than debt, the principles of 
paragraph (g)(4)(ii) of this section apply to treat the intercompany 
obligation as satisfied and reissued for an amount of cash equal to its 
fair market value immediately after the obligation becomes an 
intercompany obligation.
    (5) Examples. The application of this section to obligations of 
members is illustrated by the following examples.

    Example 1. Interest on intercompany debt. (a) Facts. On January 1 of 
Year 1, B borrows $100 from S in return for B's note providing for $10 
of interest annually at the end of each year, and repayment of $100 at 
the end of Year 5. B fully performs its obligations. Under their 
separate entity methods of accounting, B accrues a $10 interest 
deduction annually under section 163, and S accrues $10 of interest 
income annually under section 61(a)(4).
    (b) Matching rule. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the 
accrual of interest on B's note is an intercompany transaction. Under 
the matching rule, S takes its $10 of income into account in each of 
Years 1 through 5 to reflect the $10 difference between B's $10 of 
interest expense taken into account and the $0 recomputed expense. S's 
income and B's deduction are ordinary items. (Because S's intercompany 
item and B's corresponding item would both be ordinary on a separate 
entity basis, the attributes are not redetermined under paragraph 
(c)(1)(i) of this section.)
    (c) Original issue discount. The facts are the same as in paragraph 
(a) of this Example 1, except that B borrows $90 (rather than $100) from 
S in return for B's note providing for $10 of interest annually and 
repayment of $100 at the end of Year 5. The principles described in 
paragraph (b) of this Example 1 for stated interest also apply to the 
$10 of original issue discount. Thus, as B takes into account its 
corresponding expense under section 163(e), S takes into account its 
intercompany income. S's income and B's deduction are ordinary items.
    (d) Tax-exempt income. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of 
this Example 1, except that B's borrowing from S is allocable under 
section 265 to B's purchase of state and local bonds to which section 
103 applies. The timing of S's income is the same as in paragraph (b) of 
this Example 1. Under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, the 
attributes of B's corresponding item of disallowed interest expense 
control the attributes of S's offsetting intercompany interest income. 
Paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section does not prevent the 
redetermination of S's intercompany item as excluded from gross income, 
because section 265 permanently and explicitly disallows B's 
corresponding deduction. Accordingly, S's intercompany income is treated 
as excluded from gross income.
    Example 2. Intercompany debt becomes nonintercompany debt. (a) 
Facts. On January 1 of Year 1, B borrows $100 from S in return for B's 
note providing for $10 of interest annually at the end of each year, and 
repayment of $100 at the end of Year 20. As of January 1 of Year 3, B 
has paid the interest accruing under the note and S sells B's note to X 
for $70, reflecting a change in the value of the note as a result of 
increases in prevailing market interest rates. B is never insolvent 
within the meaning of section 108(d)(3).
    (b) Deemed satisfaction. Under paragraph (g)(3) of this section, B's 
note is treated as satisfied for $70 immediately before S's sale to X. 
As a result of the deemed satisfaction of the obligation for less than 
its adjusted issue price, B takes into account $30 of discharge of 
indebtedness income under section

[[Page 297]]

61(a)(12). On a separate entity basis, S's $30 loss would be a capital 
loss under section 1271(a)(1). Under the matching rule, however, the 
attributes of S's intercompany item and B's corresponding item must be 
redetermined to produce the same effect as if the transaction had 
occurred between divisions of a single corporation. B's corresponding 
item completely offsets S's intercompany item in amount. Accordingly, 
under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, the attributes of B's $30 of 
discharge of indebtedness income control the attributes of S's loss. 
Thus, S's loss is treated as ordinary loss.
    (c) Deemed reissuance. Under paragraph (g)(3) of this section, B is 
also treated as reissuing, directly to X, a new note with a $70 issue 
price and a $100 stated redemption price at maturity. The new note is 
not an intercompany obligation, it has a $70 issue price and $100 stated 
redemption price at maturity, and the $30 of original issue discount 
will be taken into account by B and X under sections 163(e) and 1272.
    (d) Creditor deconsolidation. The facts are the same as in paragraph 
(a) of this Example 2, except that P sells S's stock to X (rather than 
S's selling the note of B). Under paragraph (g)(3) of this section, the 
note is treated as satisfied by B for its $70 fair market value 
immediately before S becomes a nonmember, and B is treated as reissuing 
a new note to S immediately after S becomes a nonmember. The results for 
S's $30 of loss and B's discharge of indebtedness income are the same as 
in paragraph (b) of this Example 2. The new note is not an intercompany 
obligation, it has a $70 issue price and $100 stated redemption price at 
maturity, and the $30 of original issue discount will be taken into 
account by B and S under sections 163(e) and 1272.
    (e) Debtor deconsolidation. The facts are the same as in paragraph 
(a) of this Example 2, except that P sells B's stock to X (rather than 
S's selling the note of B). The results are the same as in paragraph (d) 
of this Example 2.
    (f) Appreciated note. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of 
this Example 2, except that S sells B's note to X for $130 (rather than 
$70), reflecting a decline in prevailing market interest rates. Under 
paragraph (g)(3) of this section, B's note is treated as satisfied for 
$130 immediately before S's sale of the note to X. Under Sec. 1.163-
7(c), B takes into account $30 of repurchase premium. On a separate 
entity basis, S's $30 gain would be a capital gain under section 
1271(a)(1), and B's $30 premium deduction would be an ordinary 
deduction. Under the matching rule, however, the attributes of S's 
intercompany item and B's corresponding item must be redetermined to 
produce the same effect as if the transaction had occurred between 
divisions of a single corporation. Under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this 
section, the attributes of B's corresponding premium deduction control 
the attributes of S's intercompany gain. Accordingly, S's gain is 
treated as ordinary income. B is also treated as reissuing a new note 
directly to X which is not an intercompany obligation. The new note has 
a $130 issue price and a $100 stated redemption price at maturity. Under 
Sec. 1.61-12(c), B's $30 premium income under the new note is taken 
into account over the life of the new note.
    Example 3. Loss or bad debt deduction with respect to intercompany 
debt. (a) Facts. On January 1 of Year 1, B borrows $100 from S in return 
for B's note providing for $10 of interest annually at the end of each 
year, and repayment of $100 at the end of Year 5. In Year 3, S sells B's 
note to P for $60. B is never insolvent within the meaning of section 
108(d)(3). Assume B's note is not a security within the meaning of 
section 165(g)(2).
    (b) Deemed satisfaction and reissuance. Under paragraph (g)(3) of 
this section, B is treated as satisfying its note for $60 immediately 
before the sale, and reissuing a new note directly to P with a $60 issue 
price and a $100 stated redemption price at maturity. On a separate 
entity basis, S's $40 loss would be a capital loss, and B's $40 income 
would be ordinary income. Under the matching rule, however, the 
attributes of S's intercompany item and B's corresponding item must be 
redetermined to produce the same effect as if the transaction had 
occurred between divisions of a single corporation. Under paragraph 
(c)(4)(i) of this section, the attributes of B's corresponding discharge 
of indebtedness income control the attributes of S's intercompany loss. 
Accordingly, S's loss is treated as ordinary loss.
    (c) Partial bad debt deduction. The facts are the same as in 
paragraph (a) of this Example 3, except that S claims a $40 partial bad 
debt deduction under section 166(a)(2) (rather than selling the note to 
P). The results are the same as in paragraph (b) of this Example 3. B's 
note is treated as satisfied and reissued with a $60 issue price. S's 
$40 intercompany deduction and B's $40 corresponding income are both 
ordinary.
    (d) Insolvent debtor. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of 
this Example 3, except that B is insolvent within the meaning of section 
108(d)(3) at the time that S sells the note to P. On a separate entity 
basis, S's $40 loss would be capital, B's $40 income would be excluded 
from gross income under section 108(a), and B would reduce attributes 
under section 108(b) or section 1017. However, under paragraph 
(g)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, section 108(a) does not apply to B's 
income to characterize it as excluded from gross income. Accordingly, 
the attributes of S's intercompany loss and B's corresponding income are 
redetermined in the same manner as in paragraph (b) of this Example 3.
    Example 4. Nonintercompany debt becomes intercompany debt. (a) 
Facts. On January 1 of

[[Page 298]]

Year 1, B borrows $100 from X in return for B's note providing for $10 
of interest annually at the end of each year, and repayment of $100 at 
the end of Year 5. As of January 1 of Year 3, B has fully performed its 
obligations, but the note's fair market value is $70. On January 1 of 
Year 3, P buys all of X's stock. B is solvent within the meaning of 
section 108(d)(3).
    (b) Deemed satisfied and reissuance. Under paragraph (g)(4) of this 
section, B is treated as satisfying its indebtedness for $70 (determined 
under the principles of Sec. 1.108-2(f)(2)) immediately after X becomes 
a member. Both X's $30 capital loss under section 1271(a)(1) and B's $30 
of discharge of indebtedness income under section 61(a)(12) are taken 
into account in determining consolidated taxable income for Year 3. 
Under paragraph (g)(4)(ii)(C) of this section, the attributes of items 
resulting from the satisfaction are determined on a separate entity 
basis. But see section 382 and Sec. 1.1502-15 (as appropriate). B is 
also treated as reissuing a new note. The new note is an intercompany 
obligation, it has a $70 issue price and $100 stated redemption price at 
maturity, and the $30 of original issue discount will be taken into 
account by B and X in the same manner as provided in paragraph (c) of 
Example 1 of this paragraph (g)(5).
    (c) Election to file consolidated returns. Assume instead that B 
borrows $100 from S during Year 1, but the P group does not file 
consolidated returns until Year 3. Under paragraph (g)(4) of this 
section, B's indebtedness is treated as satisfied and a new note 
reissued immediately after the debt becomes intercompany debt. The 
satisfaction and reissuance are deemed to occur on January 1 of Year 3, 
for the fair market value of the note (determined under the principles 
of Sec. 1.108-2(f)(2)) at that time.
    Example 5. Notional principal contracts. (a) Facts. On April 1 of 
Year 1, M1 enters into a contract with counterparty M2 under which, for 
a term of five years, M1 is obligated to make a payment to M2 each April 
1, beginning in Year 2, in an amount equal to the London Interbank 
Offered Rate (LIBOR), as determined on the immediately preceding April 
1, multiplied by a $1,000 notional principal amount. M2 is obligated to 
make a payment to M1 each April 1, beginning in Year 2, in an amount 
equal to 8% multiplied by the same notional principal amount. LIBOR is 
7.80% on April 1 of Year 1. On April 1 of Year 2, M2 owes $2 to M1.
    (b) Matching rule. Under Sec. 1.446-3(d), the net income (or net 
deduction) from a notional principal contract for a taxable year is 
included in (or deducted from) gross income. Under Sec. 1.446-3(e), the 
ratable daily portion of M2's obligation to M1 as of December 31 of Year 
1 is $1.50 ($2 multiplied by 275/365). Under the matching rule, M1's net 
income for Year 1 of $1.50 is taken into account to reflect the 
difference between M2's net deduction of $1.50 taken into account and 
the $0 recomputed net deduction. Similarly, the $.50 balance of the $2 
of net periodic payments made on April 1 of Year 2 is taken into account 
for Year 2 in M1's and M2's net income and net deduction from the 
contract. In addition, the attributes of M1's intercompany income and 
M2's corresponding deduction are redetermined to produce the same effect 
as if the transaction had occurred between divisions of a single 
corporation. Under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, the attributes 
of M2's corresponding deduction control the attributes of M1's 
intercompany income. (Although M1 is the selling member with respect to 
the payment on April 1 of Year 2, it might be the buying member in a 
subsequent period if it owes the net payment.)
    (c) Dealer. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this 
Example 5, except that M2 is a dealer in securities, and the contract 
with M1 is not inventory in the hands of M2. Under section 475, M2 must 
mark its securities to market at year-end. Assume that under section 
475, M2's loss from marking to market the contract with M1 is $100. 
Under paragraph (g)(3) of this section, M2 is treated as making a $100 
payment to M1 to terminate the contract immediately before section 475 
is applied. M1's $100 of income from the termination payment is taken 
into account under the matching rule to reflect M2's deduction under 
Sec. 1.446-3(h). The attributes of M1's intercompany income and M2's 
corresponding deduction are redetermined to produce the same effect as 
if the transaction had occurred between divisions of a single 
corporation. Under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, the attributes 
of M2's corresponding deduction control the attributes of M1's 
intercompany income. Accordingly, M1's income is treated as ordinary 
income. Paragraph (g)(3) of this section also provides that, immediately 
after section 475 would apply, a new contract is treated as reissued 
with an upfront payment of $100. Under Sec. 1.446-3(f), the deemed $100 
up front payment by M1 to M2 is taken into account over the term of the 
new contract in a manner reflecting the economic substance of the 
contract (for example, allocating the payment in accordance with the 
forward rates of a series of cash-settled forward contracts that reflect 
the specified index and the $1,000 notional principal amount). (The 
timing of taking items into account is the same if M1, rather than M2, 
is the dealer subject to the mark-to-market requirement of section 475 
at year-end. However in this case, because the attributes of the 
corresponding deduction control the attributes of the intercompany 
income, M1's income from the deemed termination payment might be 
ordinary or capital.)

    (h) Anti-avoidance rules--(1) In general. If a transaction is 
engaged in or structured with a principal purpose to avoid the purposes 
of this section (including, for example, by avoiding treatment as an 
intercompany transaction), adjustments must be made to carry out the 
purposes of this section.
    (2) Examples. The anti-avoidance rules of this paragraph (h) are 
illustrated by the following examples. The examples set forth below do 
not address common law doctrines or other authorities that might apply 
to recast a transaction or to otherwise affect the tax treatment of a 
transaction. Thus, in addition to adjustments under this paragraph (h), 
the Commissioner can, for example, apply the rules of section 269 or 
Sec. 1.701-2 to disallow a deduction or to recast a transaction.

    Example 1. Sale of a partnership interest. (a) Facts. S owns land 
with a $10 basis and $100 value. B has net operating losses from 
separate return limitation years (SRLYs) subject to limitation under 
Sec. 1.1502-21(c). Pursuant to a plan to absorb the losses without 
limitation by the SRLY rules, S transfers the land to an unrelated, 
calendar-year partnership in exchange for a 10% interest in the capital 
and profits of the partnership in a transaction to which section 721 
applies. The partnership does not have a section 754 election in effect. 
S later sells its partnership interest to B for $100. In the following 
year, the partnership sells the land to X for $100. Because the 
partnership does not have a section 754 election in effect, its $10 
basis in the land does not reflect B's $100 basis in the partnership 
interest. Under section 704(c), the partnership's $90 built-in gain is 
allocated to B, and B's basis in the partnership interest increases to 
$190 under section 705. In a later year, B sells the partnership 
interest to a nonmember for $100.
    (b) Adjustments. Under Sec. 1.1502-21(c), the partnership's $90 
built-in gain allocated to B ordinarily increases the amount of B's SRLY 
limitation, and B's $90 loss from its sale of the partnership interest 
ordinarily is not subject to limitation under the SRLY rules. Because 
the contribution of property to the partnership and the sale of the 
partnership interest were part of a plan a principal purpose of which 
was to achieve a reduction in consolidated tax liability by creating 
offsetting gain and loss for B while deferring S's intercompany gain, 
B's allocable share of the partnership's gain from its sale of the land 
is treated under paragraph (h)(1) of this section as not increasing the 
amount of B's SRLY limitation.
    Example 2. Transitory status as an intercompany obligation. (a) 
Facts. P historically has owned 70% of X's stock and the remaining 30% 
is owned by unrelated shareholders. On January 1 of Year 1, S borrows 
$100 from X in return for S's note requiring $10 of interest annually at 
the end of each year, and repayment of $100 at the end of Year 20. As of 
January 1 of Year 3, the P group has substantial net operating loss 
carryovers, and the fair market value of S's note falls to $70 due to an 
increase in prevailing market interest rates. X is not permitted under 
section 166(a)(2) to take into account a $30 loss with respect to the 
note. Pursuant to a plan to permit X to take into account its $30 loss 
without disposing of the note, P acquires an additional 10% of X's 
stock, causing X to become a member, and P subsequently resells the 10% 
interest. X's $30 loss with respect to the note is a net unrealized 
built-in loss within the meaning of Sec. 1.1502-15.
    (b) Adjustments. Under paragraph (g)(4) of this section, X 
ordinarily would take into account its $30 loss as a result of the note 
becoming an intercompany obligation, and S would take into account $30 
of discharge of indebtedness income. Under Sec. 1.1502-22, X's loss is 
not combined with items of the other members and the loss would be 
carried to X's separate return years as a result of X becoming a 
nonmember. However, the transitory status of S's indebtedness to X as an 
intercompany obligation is structured with a principal purpose to 
accelerate the recognition of X's loss. Thus, S's note is treated under 
paragraph (h)(1) of this section as not becoming an intercompany 
obligation.
    Example 3. Corporate mixing bowl. (a) Facts. M1 and M2 are 
subsidiaries of P. M1 operates a manufacturing business on land it 
leases from M2. The land is the only asset held by M2. P intends to 
dispose of the M1 business, including the land owned by M2; P's basis in 
the M1 stock is equal to the stock's fair market value. M2's land has a 
value of $20 and a basis of $0 and P has a $0 basis in the stock of M2. 
In Year 1, with a principal purpose of avoiding gain from the sale of 
the land (by transferring the land to M1 with a carry-over basis without 
affecting P's basis in the stock of M1 or M2), M1 and M2 form 
corporation T; M1 contributes cash in exchange for 80% of the T stock 
and M2 contributes the land in exchange for 20% of the stock. In Year 3, 
T liquidates, distributing $20 cash to M2 and the land (plus $60 cash) 
to M1. Under Sec. 1.1502-34, section 332 applies to both M1 and M2. 
Under section 337, T recognizes no gain or loss from its liquidating 
distribution of the land to M1. T has neither gain nor loss on its 
distribution of cash to M2. In Year 4, P sells all of the stock of M1 to 
X and liquidates M2.
    (b) Adjustments. A principal purpose for the formation and 
liquidation of T was to avoid gain from the sale of M2's land. Thus, 
under paragraph (h)(1) of this section, M2 must

[[Page 300]]

take $20 of gain into account when the stock of M1 is sold to X.
    Example 4. Partnership mixing bowl. (a) Facts. M1 owns a self-
created intangible asset with a $0 basis and a fair market value of 
$100. M2 owns land with a basis of $100 and a fair market value of $100. 
In Year 1, with a principal purpose of creating basis in the intangible 
asset (which would be eligible for amortization under section 197), M1 
and M2 form partnership PRS; M1 contributes the intangible asset and M2 
contributes the land. X, an unrelated person, contributes cash to PRS in 
exchange for a substantial interest in the partnership. PRS uses the 
contributed assets in legitimate business activities. Five years and six 
months later, PRS liquidates, distributing the land to M1, the 
intangible to M2, and cash to X. The group reports no gain under 
sections 707(a)(2)(B) and 737(a) and claims that M2's basis in the 
intangible asset is $100 under section 732 and that the asset is 
eligible for amortization under section 197.
    (b) Adjustments. A principal purpose of the formation and 
liquidation of PRS was to create additional amortization without an 
offsetting increase in consolidated taxable income by avoiding treatment 
as an intercompany transaction. Thus, under paragraph (h)(1) of this 
section, appropriate adjustments must be made.
    Example 5. Sale and leaseback. (a) Facts. S operates a factory with 
a $70 basis and $100 value, and has loss carryovers from SRLYs. Pursuant 
to a plan to take into account the $30 unrealized gain while continuing 
to operate the factory, S sells the factory to X for $100 and leases it 
back on a long-term basis. In the transaction, a substantial interest in 
the factory is transferred to X. The sale and leaseback are not 
recharacterized under general principles of Federal income tax law. As a 
result of S's sale to X, the $30 gain is taken into account and 
increases S's SRLY limitation.
    (b) No adjustments. Although S's sale was pursuant to a plan to 
accelerate the $30 gain, it is not subject to adjustment under paragraph 
(h)(1) of this section. The sale is not treated as engaged in or 
structured with a principal purpose to avoid the purposes of this 
section.

    (i) [Reserved]
    (j) Miscellaneous operating rules. For purposes of this section--
    (1) Successor assets. Any reference to an asset includes, as the 
context may require, a reference to any other asset the basis of which 
is determined, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by reference 
to the basis of the first asset.
    (2) Successor persons--(i) In general. Any reference to a person 
includes, as the context may require, a reference to a predecessor or 
successor. For this purpose, a predecessor is a transferor of assets to 
a transferee (the successor) in a transaction--
    (A) To which section 381(a) applies;
    (B) In which substantially all of the assets of the transferor are 
transferred to members in a complete liquidation;
    (C) In which the successor's basis in assets is determined (directly 
or indirectly, in whole or in part) by reference to the basis of the 
transferor, but the transferee is a successor only with respect to the 
assets the basis of which is so determined; or
    (D) Which is an intercompany transaction, but only with respect to 
assets that are being accounted for by the transferor in a prior 
intercompany transaction.
    (ii) Intercompany items. If the assets of a predecessor are acquired 
by a successor member, the successor succeeds to, and takes into account 
(under the rules of this section), the predecessor's intercompany items. 
If two or more successor members acquire assets of the predecessor, the 
successors take into account the predecessor's intercompany items in a 
manner that is consistently applied and reasonably carries out the 
purposes of this section and applicable provisions of law.
    (3) Multiple triggers. If more than one corresponding item can cause 
an intercompany item to be taken into account under the matching rule, 
the intercompany item is taken into account in connection with the 
corresponding item most consistent with the treatment of members as 
divisions of a single corporation. For example, if S sells a truck to B, 
its intercompany gain from the sale is not taken into account by 
reference to B's depreciation if the depreciation is capitalized under 
section 263A as part of B's cost for a building; instead, S's gain 
relating to the capitalized depreciation is taken into account when the 
building is sold or as it is depreciated. Similarly, if B purchases 
appreciated land from S and transfers the land to a lower-tier member in 
exchange for stock, thereby duplicating the basis of the land in the 
basis of the stock, items with respect to both the stock and the land 
can cause S's intercompany gain to be taken into account; if the lower-
tier

[[Page 301]]

member becomes a nonmember as a result of the sale of its stock, the 
attributes of S's intercompany gain are determined with respect to the 
land rather than the stock.
    (4) Multiple or successive intercompany transactions. If a member's 
intercompany item or corresponding item affects the accounting for more 
than one intercompany transaction, appropriate adjustments are made to 
treat all of the intercompany transactions as transactions between 
divisions of a single corporation. For example, if S sells property to 
M, and M sells the property to B, then S, M, and B are treated as 
divisions of a single corporation for purposes of applying the rules of 
this section. Similar principles apply with respect to intercompany 
transactions that are part of the same plan or arrangement. For example, 
if S sells separate properties to different members as part of the same 
plan or arrangement, all of the participating members are treated as 
divisions of a single corporation for purposes of determining the 
attributes (which might also affect timing) of the intercompany items 
and corresponding items from each of the properties.
    (5) Acquisition of group--(i) Scope. This paragraph (j)(5) applies 
only if a consolidated group (the terminating group) ceases to exist as 
a result of--
    (A) The acquisition by a member of another consolidated group of 
either the assets of the common parent of the terminating group in a 
reorganization described in section 381(a)(2), or the stock of the 
common parent of the terminating group; or
    (B) The application of the principles of Sec. 1.1502-75(d)(2) or 
(d)(3).
    (ii) Application. If the terminating group ceases to exist under 
circumstances described in paragraph (j)(5)(i) of this section, the 
surviving group is treated as the terminating group for purposes of 
applying this section to the intercompany transactions of the 
terminating group. For example, intercompany items and corresponding 
items from intercompany transactions between members of the terminating 
group are taken into account under the rules of this section by the 
surviving group. This treatment does not apply, however, to members of 
the terminating group that are not members of the surviving group 
immediately after the terminating group ceases to exist (for example, 
under section 1504(a)(3) relating to reconsolidation, or section 1504(c) 
relating to includible insurance companies).
    (6) Former common parent treated as continuation of group. If a 
group terminates because the common parent is the only remaining member, 
the common parent succeeds to the treatment of the terminating group for 
purposes of applying this section so long as it neither becomes a member 
of an affiliated group filing separate returns nor becomes a corporation 
described in section 1504(b). For example, if the only subsidiary of the 
group liquidates into the common parent in a complete liquidation to 
which section 332 applies, or the common parent merges into the 
subsidiary and the subsidiary is treated as the common parent's 
successor under paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section, the taxable income 
of the surviving corporation is treated as the group's consolidated 
taxable income in which the intercompany and corresponding items must be 
included. See Sec. 1.267(f)-1 for additional rules applicable to 
intercompany losses or deductions.
    (7) Becoming a nonmember. For purposes of this section, a member is 
treated as becoming a nonmember if it has a separate return year 
(including another group's consolidated return year). A member is not 
treated as having a separate return year if its items are treated as 
taken into account in computing the group's consolidated taxable income 
under paragraph (j)(5) or (6) of this section.
    (8) Recordkeeping. Intercompany and corresponding items must be 
reflected on permanent records (including work papers). See also section 
6001, requiring records to be maintained. The group must be able to 
identify from these permanent records the amount, location, timing, and 
attributes of the items, so as to permit the application of the rules of 
this section for each year.
    (9) Examples. The operating rules of this paragraph (j) are 
illustrated generally throughout this section, and by the following 
examples.


[[Page 302]]


    Example 1. Intercompany sale followed by section 351 transfer to 
member. (a) Facts. S holds land for investment with a basis of $70. On 
January 1 of Year 1, S sells the land to M for $100. M also holds the 
land for investment. On July 1 of Year 3, M transfers the land to B in 
exchange for all of B's stock in a transaction to which section 351 
applies. Under section 358, M's basis in the B stock is $100. B holds 
the land for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business and, 
under section 362(b), B's basis in the land is $100. On December 1 of 
Year 5, M sells 20% of the B stock to X for $22. In an unrelated 
transaction on July 1 of Year 8, B sells 20% of the land for $22.
    (b) Definitions. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, S's sale of 
the land to M and M's transfer of the land to B are both intercompany 
transactions. S is the selling member and M is the buying member in the 
first intercompany transaction, and M is the selling member and B is the 
buying member in the second intercompany transaction. M has no 
intercompany items under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Because B 
acquired the land in an intercompany transaction, B's items from the 
land are corresponding items to be taken into account under this 
section. Under the successor asset rule of paragraph (j)(1) of this 
section, references to the land include references to M's B stock. Under 
the successor person rule of paragraph (j)(2) of this section, 
references to M include references to B with respect to the land.
    (c) Timing and attributes resulting from the stock sale. Under 
paragraph (c)(3) of this section, M is treated as owning and selling B's 
stock for purposes of the matching rule even though, as divisions, M 
could not own and sell stock in B. Under paragraph (j)(3) of this 
section, both M's B stock and B's land can cause S's intercompany gain 
to be taken into account under the matching rule. Thus, S takes $6 of 
its gain into account in Year 5 to reflect the $6 difference between M's 
$2 gain taken into account from its sale of B stock and the $8 
recomputed gain. Under paragraph (j)(4) of this section, the attributes 
of this gain are determined by treating S, M, and B as divisions of a 
single corporation. Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, S's $6 gain 
and M's $2 gain are treated as long-term capital gain. The gain would be 
capital on a separate entity basis (assuming that section 341 does not 
apply), and this treatment is not inconsistent with treating S, M, and B 
as divisions of a single corporation because the stock sale and 
subsequent land sale are unrelated transactions and B remains a member 
following the sale.
    (d) Timing and attributes resulting from the land sale. Under 
paragraph (j)(3) of this section, S takes $6 of its gain into account in 
Year 8 under the matching rule to reflect the $6 difference between B's 
$2 gain taken into account from its sale of an interest in the land and 
the $8 recomputed gain. Under paragraph (j)(4) of this section, the 
attributes of this gain are determined by treating S, M, and B as 
divisions of a single corporation and taking into account the activities 
of S, M, and B with respect to the land. Thus, both S's gain and B's 
gain might be ordinary income as a result of B's activities. (If B 
subsequently sells the balance of the land, S's gain taken into account 
is limited to its remaining $18 of intercompany gain.)
    (e) Sale of successor stock resulting in deconsolidation. The facts 
are the same as in paragraph (a) of this Example 1, except that M sells 
60% of the B stock to X for $66 on December 1 of Year 5 and B becomes a 
nonmember. Under the matching rule, M's sale of B stock results in $18 
of S's gain being taken into account (to reflect the difference between 
M's $6 gain taken into account and the $24 recomputed gain). Under the 
acceleration rule, however, the entire $30 gain is taken into account 
(to reflect B becoming a nonmember, because its basis in the land 
reflects M's $100 cost basis from the prior intercompany transaction). 
Under paragraph (j)(4) of this section, the attributes of S's gain are 
determined by treating S, M, and B as divisions of a single corporation. 
Because M's cost basis in the land will be reflected by B as a 
nonmember, all of S's gain is treated as from the land (rather than a 
portion being from B's stock), and B's activities with respect to the 
land might therefore result in S's gain being ordinary income.
    Example 2. Intercompany sale of member stock followed by 
recapitalization. (a) Facts. Before becoming a member of the P group, S 
owns P stock with a basis of $70. On January 1 of Year 1, P buys all of 
S's stock. On July 1 of Year 3, S sells the P stock to M for $100. On 
December 1 of Year 5, P acquires M's original P stock in exchange for 
new P stock in a recapitalization described in section 368(a)(1)(E).
    (b) Timing and attributes. Although P's basis in the stock acquired 
from M is eliminated under paragraph (f)(4) of this section, the new P 
stock received by M is exchanged basis property (within the meaning of 
section 7701(a)(44)) having a basis under section 358 equal to M's basis 
in the original P stock. Under the successor asset rule of paragraph 
(j)(1) of this section, references to M's original P stock include 
references to M's new P stock. Because it is still possible to take S's 
intercompany item into account under the matching rule with respect to 
the successor asset, S's gain is not taken into account under the 
acceleration rule as a result of the basis elimination under paragraph 
(f)(4) of this section. Instead, the gain is taken into account based on 
subsequent events with respect to M's new P stock (for example, a 
subsequent distribution or redemption of the new stock).

[[Page 303]]

    Example 3. Back-to-back intercompany transactions--matching. (a) 
Facts. S holds land for investment with a basis of $70. On January 1 of 
Year 1, S sells the land to M for $90. M also holds the land for 
investment. On July 1 of Year 3, M sells the land for $100 to B, and B 
holds the land for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. 
During Year 5, B sells all of the land to customers for $105.
    (b) Timing. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, S's sale of the 
land to M and M's sale of the land to B are both intercompany 
transactions. S is the selling member and M is the buying member in the 
first intercompany transaction, and M is the selling member and B is the 
buying member in the second intercompany transaction. Under paragraph 
(j)(4) of this section, S, M and B are treated as divisions of a single 
corporation for purposes of determining the timing of their items from 
the intercompany transactions. See also paragraph (j)(2) of this section 
(B is treated as a successor to M for purposes of taking S's 
intercompany gain into account). Thus, S's $20 gain and M's $10 gain are 
both taken into account in Year 5 to reflect the difference between B's 
$5 gain taken into account with respect to the land and the $35 
recomputed gain (the gain that B would have taken into account if the 
intercompany sales had been transfers between divisions of a single 
corporation, and B succeeded to S's $70 basis).
    (c) Attributes. Under paragraphs (j)(4) of this section, the 
attributes of the intercompany items and corresponding items of S, M, 
and B are also determined by treating S, M, and B as divisions of a 
single corporation. For example, the attributes of S's and M's 
intercompany items are determined by taking B's activities into account.
    Example 4. Back-to-back intercompany transactions--acceleration. (a) 
Facts. During Year 1, S performs services for M in exchange for $10 from 
M. S incurs $8 of employee expenses. M capitalizes the $10 cost of S's 
services under section 263 as part of M's cost to acquire real property 
from X. Under its separate entity method of accounting, S would take its 
income and expenses into account in Year 1. M holds the real property 
for investment and, on July 1 of Year 5, M sells it to B at a gain. B 
also holds the real property for investment. On December 1 of Year 8, 
while B still owns the real property, P sells all of M's stock to X and 
M becomes a nonmember.
    (b) M's items. M takes its gain into account immediately before it 
becomes a nonmember. Because the real property stays in the group, the 
acceleration rule redetermines the attributes of M's gain under the 
principles of the matching rule as if B sold the real property to an 
affiliated corporation that is not a member of the group for a cash 
payment equal to B's adjusted basis in the real property, and S, M, and 
B were divisions of a single corporation. Thus, M's gain is capital 
gain.
    (c) S's items. Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, S 
includes the $8 of expenses in determining its $2 intercompany income. 
In Year 1, S takes into account $8 of income and $8 of expenses. Under 
paragraph (j)(4) of this section, appropriate adjustments must be made 
to treat both S's performance of services for M and M's sale to B as 
occurring between divisions of a single corporation. Thus, S's $2 of 
intercompany income is not taken into account as a result of M becoming 
a nonmember, but instead will be taken into account based on subsequent 
events (e.g., under the matching rule based on B's sale of the real 
property to a nonmember, or under the acceleration rule based on P's 
sale of the stock of S or B to a nonmember). See the successor person 
rules of paragraph (j)(2) of this section (B is treated as a successor 
to M for purposes of taking S's intercompany income into account).
    (d) Sale of S's stock. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of 
this Example 4, except that P sells all of S's stock (rather than M's 
stock) and S becomes a nonmember on July 1 of Year 5. S's remaining $2 
of intercompany income is taken into account immediately before S 
becomes a nonmember. Because S's intercompany income is not from an 
intercompany sale, exchange, or distribution of property, the attributes 
of the intercompany income are determined on a separate entity basis. 
Thus, S's $2 of intercompany income is ordinary income. M does not take 
any of its intercompany gain into account as a result of S becoming a 
nonmember.
    (e) Intercompany income followed by intercompany loss. The facts are 
the same as in paragraph (a) of this Example 4, except that M sells the 
real property to B at a $1 loss (rather than a gain). M takes its $1 
loss into account under the acceleration rule immediately before M 
becomes a nonmember. But see Sec. 1.267(f)-1 (which might further defer 
M's loss if M and B remain in a controlled group relationship after M 
becomes a nonmember). Under paragraph (j)(4) of this section appropriate 
adjustments must be made to treat the group as if both intercompany 
transactions occurred between divisions of a single corporation. 
Accordingly, P's sale of M stock also results in S taking into account 
$1 of intercompany income as capital gain to offset M's $1 of 
corresponding capital loss. The remaining $1 of S's intercompany income 
is taken into account based on subsequent events.
    Example 5. Successor group. (a) Facts. On January 1 of Year 1, B 
borrows $100 from S in return for B's note providing for $10 of interest 
annually at the end of each year, and repayment of $100 at the end of 
Year 20. As of January 1 of Year 3, B has paid the interest accruing 
under the note. On that date, X acquires all of P's stock and the former 
P

[[Page 304]]

group members become members of the X consolidated group.
    (b) Successor. Under paragraph (j)(5) of this section, although B's 
note ceases to be an intercompany obligation of the P group, the note is 
not treated as satisfied and reissued under paragraph (g) of this 
section as a result of X's acquisition of P stock. Instead, the X 
consolidated group succeeds to the treatment of the P group for purposes 
of paragraph (g) of this section, and B's note is treated as an 
intercompany obligation of the X consolidated group.
    (c) No subgroups. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this 
Example 5, except that X simultaneously acquires the stock of S and B 
from P (rather than X acquiring all of P's stock). Paragraph (j)(5) of 
this section does not apply to X's acquisitions. Unless an exception 
described in paragraph (g)(3)(i)(B) applies, B's note is treated as 
satisfied immediately before S and B become nonmembers, and reissued 
immediately after they become members of the X consolidated group. The 
amount at which the note is satisfied and reissued under paragraph 
(g)(3) of this section is based on the fair market value of the note at 
the time of P's sales to X. Paragraph (g)(4) of this section does not 
apply to the reissued B note in the X consolidated group, because the 
new note is always an intercompany obligation of the X consolidated 
group.
    Example 6. Liquidation--80% distributee. (a) Facts. X has had 
preferred stock described in section 1504(a)(4) outstanding for several 
years. On January 1 of Year 1, S buys all of X's common stock for $60, 
and B buys all of X's preferred stock for $40. X's assets have a $0 
basis and $100 value. On July 1 of Year 3, X distributes all of its 
assets to S and B in a complete liquidation. Under Sec. 1.1502-34, 
section 332 applies to both S and B. Under section 337, X has no gain or 
loss from its liquidating distribution to S. Under sections 336 and 
337(c), X has a $40 gain from its liquidating distribution to B. B has a 
$40 basis under section 334(a) in the assets received from X, and S has 
a $0 basis under section 334(b) in the assets received from X.
    (b) Intercompany items from the liquidation. Under the matching 
rule, X's $40 gain from its liquidating distribution to B is not taken 
into account under this section as a result of the liquidation (and 
therefore is not yet reflected under Sec. Sec. 1.1502-32 and 1.1502-
33). Under the successor person rule of paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this 
section, S and B are both successors to X. Under section 337(c), X 
recognizes gain or loss only with respect to the assets distributed to 
B. Under paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section, to be consistent with the 
purposes of this section, S succeeds to X's $40 intercompany gain. The 
gain will be taken into account by S under the matching and acceleration 
rules of this section based on subsequent events. (The allocation of the 
intercompany gain to S does not govern the allocation of any other 
attributes.)
    Example 7. Liquidation--no 80% distributee. (a) Facts. X has only 
common stock outstanding. On January 1 of Year 1, S buys 60% of X's 
stock for $60, and B buys 40% of X's stock for $40. X's assets have a $0 
basis and $100 value. On July 1 of Year 3, X distributes all of its 
assets to S and B in a complete liquidation. Under Sec. 1.1502-34, 
section 332 applies to both S and B. Under sections 336 and 337(c), X 
has a $100 gain from its liquidating distributions to S and B. Under 
section 334(b), S has a $60 basis in the assets received from X and B 
has a $40 basis in the assets received from X.
    (b) Intercompany items from the liquidation. Under the matching 
rule, X's $100 intercompany gain from its liquidating distributions to S 
and B is not taken into account under this section as a result of the 
liquidation (and therefore is not yet reflected under Sec. Sec. 1.1502-
32 and 1.1502-33). Under the successor person rule of paragraph 
(j)(2)(i) of this section, S and B are both successors to X. Under 
paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section, to be consistent with the purposes 
of this section, S succeeds to X's $40 intercompany gain with respect to 
the assets distributed to B, and B succeeds to X's $60 intercompany gain 
with respect to the assets distributed to S. The gain will be taken into 
account by S and B under the matching and acceleration rules of this 
section based on subsequent events. (The allocation of the intercompany 
gain does not govern the allocation of any other attributes.)

    (l) Effective dates--(1) In general. This section applies with 
respect to transactions occurring in years beginning on or after July 
12, 1995. If both this section and prior law apply to a transaction, or 
neither applies, with the result that items may be duplicated, omitted, 
or eliminated in determining taxable income (or tax liability), or items 
may be treated inconsistently, prior law (and not this section) applies 
to the transaction. For example, S's and B's items from S's sale of 
property to B which occurs in a consolidated return year beginning 
before July 12, 1995, are taken into account under prior law, even 
though B may dispose of the property in a consolidated return year 
beginning on or after July 12, 1995. Similarly, an intercompany 
distribution to which a shareholder becomes entitled in a consolidated 
return year beginning before July 12, 1995, but which is distributed in 
a consolidated return year beginning on or after that date is taken into 
account under prior law (generally when distributed), because this 
section generally takes dividends into account when the shareholder 
becomes entitled to them but this section does not apply at that time. 
If application of prior law to S's deferred gain or loss from a deferred 
intercompany transaction (as defined under prior law) occurring in a 
consolidated return year beginning prior to July 12, 1995, would be 
affected by an intercompany transaction (as defined under this section) 
occurring in a consolidated return year beginning on or after July 12, 
1995, S's deferred gain or loss continues to be taken into account as 
provided under prior law, and the items from the subsequent intercompany 
transaction are taken into account under this section. Appropriate 
adjustments must be made to prevent items from being duplicated,omitted, 
or eliminated in determining taxable income as a result of the 
application of both this section and prior law to the successive 
transactions, and to ensure the proper application of prior law.
    (2) Avoidance transactions. This paragraph (l)(2) applies if a 
transaction is engaged in or structured on or after April 8, 1994, with 
a principal purpose to avoid the rules of this section (and instead to 
apply prior law). If this paragraph (l)(2) applies, appropriate 
adjustments must be made in years beginning on or after July 12, 1995, 
to prevent the avoidance, duplication, omission, or elimination of any 
item (or tax liability), or any other inconsistency with the rules of 
this section. For example, if S is a dealer in real property and sells 
land to B on March 16, 1995 with a principal purpose of converting any 
future appreciation in the land to capital gain, B's gain from the sale 
of the land on May 11, 1997 might be characterized as ordinary income 
under this paragraph (l)(2).
    (3) Election for certain stock elimination transactions--(i) In 
general. A group may elect pursuant to this paragraph (l)(3) to apply 
this section (including the elections available under paragraph 
(f)(5)(ii) of this section) to stock elimination transactions to which 
prior law would otherwise apply. If an election is made, this section, 
and not prior law, applies to determine the timing and attributes of S's 
and B's gain or loss from stock with respect to all stock elimination 
transactions.
    (ii) Stock elimination transactions. For purposes of this paragraph 
(l)(3), a stock elimination transaction is a transaction in which stock 
transferred from S to B--
    (A) Is cancelled or redeemed on or after July 12, 1995;
    (B) Is treated as cancelled in a liquidation pursuant to an election 
under section 338(h)(10) with respect to a qualified stock purchase with 
an acquisition date on or after July 12, 1995;
    (C) Is distributed on or after July 12, 1995; or
    (D) Is exchanged on or after July 12, 1995 for stock of a member 
(determined immediately after the exchange) in a transaction that would 
cause S's gain or loss from the transfer to be taken into account under 
prior law.
    (iii) Time and manner of making election. An election under this 
paragraph (l)(3) is made by attaching to a timely filed original return 
(including extensions) for the consolidated return year including July 
12, 1995 a statement entitled ``[Insert Name and Employer Identification 
Number of Common Parent] HEREBY ELECTS THE APPLICATION OF Sec. 1.1502-
13(l)(3).'' See paragraph (f)(5)(ii)(E) of this section for the

[[Page 306]]

manner of electing the relief provisions of paragraph (f)(5)(ii) of this 
section.
    (4) Prior law. For transactions occurring in S's years beginning 
before July 12, 1995, see the applicable regulations issued under 
section 1502. See Sec. Sec. 1.1502-13, 1.1502-13T, 1.1502-14, 1.1502-
14T, 1.1502-31, and 1.1502-32 (as contained in the 26 CFR part 1 edition 
revised as of April 1, 1995).
    (5) Consent to adopt method of accounting. For intercompany 
transactions occurring in a consolidated group's first taxable year 
beginning on or after July 12, 1995, the Commissioner's consent under 
section 446(e) is hereby granted for any changes in methods of 
accounting that are necessary solely by reason of the timing rules of 
this section. Changes in method of accounting for these transactions are 
to be effected on a cut-off basis.

    (1) Paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section (limitation on treatment of 
intercompany income or gain as excluded from gross income) does not 
apply to prevent any intercompany income or gain from being excluded 
from gross income;
    (2) Any gain or loss from an intercompany obligation is not subject

<R05>
Sec. 1.1502-15  SRLY limitation on built-in losses.

    (a) SRLY limitation. Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this 
section (relating to built-in losses of the common parent) and paragraph 
(g) of this section (relating to an overlap with section 382), built-in 
losses are subject to the SRLY limitation under Sec. Sec. 1.1502-21(c) 
and 1.1502-22(c) (including applicable subgroup principles). Built-in 
losses are treated as deductions or losses in the year recognized, 
except for the purpose of determining the amount of, and the extent to 
which the built-in loss is limited by, the SRLY limitation for the year 
in which it is recognized. Solely for such purpose, a built-in loss is 
treated as a hypothetical net operating loss carryover or net capital 
loss carryover arising in a SRLY, instead of as a deduction or loss in 
the year recognized. To the extent that a built-in loss is allowed as a 
deduction under this section in the year it is recognized, it offsets 
any consolidated taxable income for the year before any loss carryovers 
or carrybacks are allowed as a deduction. To the extent not so allowed, 
it is treated as a separate net operating loss or net capital loss 
carryover or carryback arising in the year of recognition and, under 
Sec. 1.1502-21(c) or 1.1502-22(c), the year of recognition is treated 
as a SRLY.
    (b) Built-in losses--(1) Defined. If a corporation has a net 
unrealized built-in loss under section 382(h)(3) (as modified by this 
section) on the day it becomes a member of the group (whether or not the 
group is a consolidated group), its deductions and losses are built-in 
losses under this section to the

[[Page 307]]

extent they are treated as recognized built-in losses under section 
382(h)(2)(B) (as modified by this section). This paragraph (b) generally 
applies separately with respect to each member, but see paragraph (c) of 
this section for circumstances in which it is applied on a subgroup 
basis.
    (2) Operating rules. Solely for purposes of applying paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section, the principles of Sec. 1.1502-94(c) apply with 
appropriate adjustments, including the following:
    (i) Stock acquisition. A corporation is treated as having an 
ownership change under section 382(g) on the day the corporation becomes 
a member of a group, and no other events (e.g., a subsequent ownership 
change under section 382(g) while it is a member) are treated as causing 
an ownership change.
    (ii) Asset acquisition. In the case of an asset acquisition by a 
group, the assets and liabilities acquired directly from the same 
transferor (whether corporate or non-corporate, foreign or domestic) 
pursuant to the same plan are treated as the assets and liabilities of a 
corporation that becomes a member of the group (and has an ownership 
change) on the date of the acquisition.
    (iii) Recognized built-in gain or loss. A loss that is included in 
the determination of net unrealized built-in gain or loss and that is 
recognized but disallowed or deferred (e.g., under Sec. Sec. 1.337(d)-
2T, 1.1502-35T, or section 267) is not treated as a built-in loss unless 
and until the loss would be allowed during the recognition period 
without regard to the application of this section. Section 
382(h)(1)(B)(ii) does not apply to the extent it limits the amount of 
recognized built-in loss that may be treated as a pre-change loss to the 
amount of the net unrealized built-in loss.
    (c) Built-in losses of subgroups--(1) In general. In the case of a 
subgroup, the principles of paragraph (b) of this section apply to the 
subgroup, and not separately to its members. Thus, the net unrealized 
built-in loss and recognized built-in loss for purposes of paragraph (b) 
of this section are based on the aggregate amounts for each member of 
the subgroup.
    (2) Members of subgroups. A subgroup is composed of those members 
that have been continuously affiliated with each other for the 60 
consecutive month period ending immediately before they become members 
of the group in which the loss is recognized. A member remains a member 
of the subgroup until it ceases to be affiliated with the loss member. 
For this purpose, the principles of Sec. 1.1502-21(c)(2)(iv) through 
(vi) apply with appropriate adjustments.
    (3) Coordination of 60 month affiliation requirement with the 
overlap rule. If one or more corporations become members of a group and 
are included in the determination of a net unrealized built-in loss that 
is subject to the overlap rule described in paragraph (g)(1) of this 
section, then for purposes of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, such 
corporations that become members of the group are treated as having been 
affiliated for 60 consecutive months with the common parent of the group 
and are also treated as having been affiliated with any other members 
who have been affiliated or are treated as having been affiliated with 
the common parent at such time. The corporations are treated as having 
been affiliated with such other members for the same period of time that 
those members have been affiliated or are treated as having been 
affiliated with the common parent. If two or more corporations become 
members of the group at the same time, but this paragraph (c)(3) does 
not apply to every such corporation, then immediately after the 
corporations become members of the group, and solely for purposes of 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the corporations to which this 
paragraph (c)(3) applies are treated as having not been previously 
affiliated with the corporations to which this paragraph (c)(3) does not 
apply. If the common parent has become the common parent of an existing 
group within the previous five year period in a transaction described in 
Sec. 1.1502-75(d)(2)(ii) or (3), the principles of Sec. Sec. 1.1502-
91(g)(6) and 1.1502-96(a)(2)(iii) shall apply.
    (4) Built-in amounts. Solely for purposes of determining whether the 
subgroup has a net unrealized built-in loss or whether it has a 
recognized built-in loss, the principles of Sec. 1.1502-91(g) and (h) 
apply with appropriate adjustments.

[[Page 308]]

    (d) Examples. For purposes of the examples in this section, unless 
otherwise stated, all groups file consolidated returns, all corporations 
have calendar taxable years, the facts set forth the only corporate 
activity, value means fair market value and the adjusted basis of each 
asset equals its value, all transactions are with unrelated persons, and 
the application of any limitation or threshold under section 382 is 
disregarded. The principles of this section are illustrated by the 
following examples:

    Example 1. Determination of recognized built-in loss. (i) Individual 
A owns all of the stock of P and T. T has two depreciable assets. Asset 
1 has an unrealized loss of $55 (basis $75, value $20), and asset 2 has 
an unrealized gain of $20 (basis $30, value $50). P acquires all the 
stock of T from Individual A during Year 1, and T becomes a member of 
the P group. P's acquisition of T is not an ownership change as defined 
by section 382(g). Paragraph (g) of this section does not apply because 
there is not an overlap of the application of the rules contained in 
paragraph (a) of this section and section 382.
    (ii) Under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, and solely for 
purposes of applying paragraph (b)(1) of this section, T is treated as 
having an ownership change under section 382(g) on becoming a member of 
the P group. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, none of T's $55 of 
unrealized loss is treated as a built-in loss unless T has a net 
unrealized built-in loss under section 382(h)(3) on becoming a member of 
the P group.
    (iii) Under section 382(h)(3)(A), T has a $35 net unrealized built-
in loss on becoming a member of the P group (($55)+$20=($35)). Assume 
that this amount exceeds the threshold requirement in section 
382(h)(3)(B). Under section 382(h)(2)(B), the entire amount of T's $55 
unrealized loss is treated as a built-in loss to the extent it is 
recognized during the 5-year recognition period described in section 
382(h)(7). Under paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, the restriction 
under section 382(h)(1)(B)(ii), which limits the amount of recognized 
built-in loss that is treated as pre-change loss to the amount of the 
net unrealized built-in loss, is inapplicable for this purpose. 
Consequently, the entire $55 of unrealized loss (not just the $35 net 
unrealized loss) is treated under paragraph (b)(1) of this section as a 
built-in loss to the extent it is recognized within 5 years of T's 
becoming a member of the P group. Under paragraph (a) of this section, a 
built-in loss is subject to the SRLY limitation under Sec. 1.1502-
21(c)(1).
    (iv) Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the built-in loss 
would similarly be subject to a SRLY limitation under Sec. 1.1502-
21(c)(1) if T transferred all of its assets and liabilities to a 
subsidiary of the P group in a single transaction described in section 
351. To the extent the built-in loss is recognized within 5 years of T's 
transfer, all of the items contributed by the acquiring subsidiary to 
consolidated taxable income (and not just the items attributable to the 
assets and liabilities transferred by T) are included for purposes of 
determining the SRLY limitation under Sec. 1.1502-21(c)(1).
    Example 2. Actual application of section 382 not relevant. (i) 
Individual A owns all of the stock of P, and Individual B owns all of 
the stock of T. T has two depreciable assets. Asset 1 has an unrealized 
loss of $25 (basis $75, value $50), and asset 2 has an unrealized gain 
of $20 (basis $30, value $50). P buys 55 percent of the stock of T in 
January of Year 1, resulting in an ownership change of T under section 
382(g). During March of Year 2, P buys the 45 percent balance of the T 
stock, and T becomes a member of the P group.
    (ii) Although T has an ownership change for purposes of section 382 
in Year 1 and not Year 2, T's joining the P group in Year 2 is treated 
as an ownership change under section 382(g) solely for purposes of this 
section. Consequently, for purposes of this section, whether T has a net 
unrealized built-in loss under section 382(h)(3) is determined as if the 
day T joined the P group were a change date.
    Example 3. Determination of a recognized built-in loss of a 
subgroup. (i) Individual A owns all of the stock of P, S, and M. P and M 
are each the common parent of a consolidated group. During Year 1, P 
acquires all of the stock of S from Individual A, and S becomes a member 
of the P group. P's acquisition of S is not an ownership change as 
defined by section 382(g). At the beginning of Year 7, M acquires all of 
the stock of P from Individual A, and P and S become members of the M 
group. M's acquisitions of P and S are also not ownership changes as 
defined by section 382(g). At the time of M's acquisition of the P 
stock, P has (disregarding the stock of S) a $10 net unrealized built-in 
gain (two depreciable assets, asset 1 with a basis of $35 and a value of 
$55, and asset 2 with a basis of $55 and a value of $45), and S has a 
$75 net unrealized built-in loss (two depreciable assets, asset 3 with a 
basis of $95 and a value of $10, and asset 4 with a basis of $10 and a 
value of $20).
    (ii) Under paragraph (c) of this section, P and S compose a subgroup 
on becoming members of the M group because P and S were continuously 
affiliated for the 60 month period ending immediately before they became 
members of the M group. Consequently, paragraph (b) of this section does 
not apply to P and S separately. Instead, their separately computed 
unrealized gains and losses are aggregated for purposes of determining 
whether, and the extent to which, any unrealized loss is treated as 
built-in loss

[[Page 309]]

under this section and is subject to the SRLY limitation under Sec. 
1.1502-21(c).
    (iii) Under paragraph (c) of this section, the P subgroup has a net 
unrealized built-in loss on the day P and S become members of the M 
group, determined by treating the day they become members as a change 
date. The net unrealized built-in loss is the aggregate of P's net 
unrealized built-in gain of $10 and S's net unrealized built-in loss of 
$75, or an aggregate net unrealized built-in loss of $65. (The stock of 
S owned by P is disregarded for purposes of determining the net 
unrealized built-in loss. However, any loss allowed on the sale of the 
stock within the recognition period is taken into account in determining 
recognized loss.) Assume that the $65 net unrealized built-in loss 
exceeds the threshold requirement under section 382(h)(3)(B).
    (iv) Under paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2)(iii), and (c) of this section, 
a loss recognized during the 5-year recognition period on an asset of P 
or S held on the day that P and S became members of the M group is a 
built-in loss except to the extent the group establishes that such loss 
exceeds the amount by which the adjusted basis of such asset on the day 
the member became a member exceeded the fair market value of such asset 
on that same day. If P sells asset 2 for $45 in Year 7 and recognizes a 
$10 loss, the entire $10 loss is treated as a built-in loss under 
paragraphs (b)(2)(iii) and (c) of this section. If S sells asset 3 for 
$10 in Year 7 and recognizes an $85 loss, the entire $85 loss is treated 
as a built-in loss under paragraphs (b)(2)(iii) and (c) of this section 
(not just the $55 balance of the P subgroup's $65 net unrealized built-
in loss).
    (v) The determination of whether P and S constitute a SRLY subgroup 
for purposes of loss carryovers and carrybacks, and the extent to which 
built-in losses are not allowed under the SRLY limitation, is made under 
Sec. 1.1502-21(c).
    Example 4. Computation of SRLY limitation. (i) Individual A owns all 
of the stock of P, the common parent of a consolidated group. During 
Year 1, Individual A forms T by contributing $300, and T sustains a $100 
net operating loss. During Year 2, T's assets decline in value to $100. 
At the beginning of Year 3, P acquires all the stock of T from 
Individual A, and T becomes a member of the P group with a net 
unrealized built-in loss of $100. P's acquisition of T is not an 
ownership change as defined by section 382(g). Assume that $100 exceeds 
the threshold requirements of section 382(h)(3)(B). During Year 3, T 
recognizes its unrealized built-in loss as a $100 ordinary loss. The 
members of the P group contribute the following net income to the 
consolidated taxable income of the P group (disregarding T's recognized 
built-in loss and any consolidated net operating loss deduction under 
Sec. 1.1502-21) for Years 3 and 4:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                Year 3   Year 4   Total
------------------------------------------------------------------------
P group (without T)                               $100     $100     $200
T............................................       60       40      100
CTI..........................................      160      140      300
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) Under paragraph (b) of this section, T's $100 ordinary loss in 
Year 3 (not taken into account in the consolidated taxable income 
computations above) is a built-in loss. Under paragraph (a) of this 
section, the built-in loss is treated as a net operating loss carryover 
for purposes of determining the SRLY limitation under Sec. 1.1502-
21(c).
    (iii) For Year 3, Sec. 1.1502-21(c) limits T's $100 built-in loss 
and $100 net operating loss carryover from Year 1 to the aggregate of 
the P group's consolidated taxable income through Year 3, determined by 
reference to only T's items. For this purpose, consolidated taxable 
income is determined without regard to any consolidated net operating 
loss deductions under Sec. 1.1502-21(a).
    (iv) The P group's consolidated taxable income through Year 3 is $60 
when determined by reference to only T's items. Under Sec. 1.1502-
21(c), the SRLY limitation for Year 3 is therefore $60.
    (v) Under paragraph (a) of this section, the $100 built-in loss is 
treated as a current deduction for all purposes other than determination 
of the SRLY limitation under Sec. 1.1502-21(c). Consequently, a 
deduction for the built-in loss is allowed in Year 3 before T's loss 
carryover from Year 1 is allowed, but only to the extent of the $60 SRLY 
limitation. None of T's Year 1 loss carryover is allowed because the 
built-in loss ($100) exceeds the SRLY limitation for Year 3.
    (vi) The $40 balance of the built-in loss that is not allowed in 
Year 3 because of the SRLY limitation is treated as a $40 net operating 
loss arising in Year 3 that is carried to other years in accordance with 
the rules of Sec. 1.1502-21(b). The $40 net operating loss is treated 
under paragraph (a) of this section and Sec. 1.1502-21(c)(1)(ii) as a 
loss carryover or carryback from Year 3 that arises in a SRLY, and is 
subject to the rules of Sec. 1.1502-21 (including Sec. 1.1502-21(c)) 
rather than this section. See also Sec. 1.1502-21(c)(1)(iii) Example 4.
    (vii) The facts are the same as in paragraphs (i) through (vi) of 
this Example 4, except that T has an additional built-in loss when it 
joins the P group which is recognized in Year 4. For purposes of 
determining the SRLY limitation for this additional loss in Year 4 (or 
any subsequent year), the $60 of built-in loss allowed as a deduction in 
Year 3 is treated under paragraph (a) of this section as a deduction in 
Year 3 that reduces the P group's consolidated taxable income when 
determined by reference to only T's items.
    Example 5. Built-in loss exceeding consolidated taxable income in 
the year recognized. (i)

[[Page 310]]

Individual A owns all of the stock of P and T. During Year 1, P acquires 
all the stock of T from Individual A, and T becomes a member of the P 
group. P's acquisition of T was not an ownership change as defined by 
section 382(g). At the time of acquisition, T has a noncapital asset 
with an unrealized loss of $45 (basis $100, value $55), which exceeds 
the threshold requirements of section 382(h)(3)(B). During Year 2, T 
sells its asset for $55 and recognizes the unrealized built-in loss. The 
P group has $10 of consolidated taxable income in Year 2, computed by 
disregarding T's recognition of the $45 built-in loss and the 
consolidated net operating loss deduction, while the consolidated 
taxable income would be $25 if determined by reference to only T's items 
(other than the $45 loss).
    (ii) T's $45 loss is recognized in Year 2 and, under paragraph (b) 
of this section, constitutes a built-in loss. Under paragraph (a) of 
this section and Sec. 1.1502-21(c)(1)(ii), the loss is treated as a net 
operating loss carryover to Year 2 for purposes of applying the SRLY 
limitation under Sec. 1.1502-21(c).
    (iii) For Year 2, T's SRLY limitation is the aggregate of the P 
group's consolidated taxable income through Year 2 determined by 
reference to only T's items. For this purpose, consolidated taxable 
income is determined by disregarding any built-in loss that is treated 
as a net operating loss carryover, and any consolidated net operating 
loss deductions under Sec. 1.1502-21(a). Consolidated taxable income so 
determined is $25.
    (iv) Under Sec. 1.1502-21(c), $25 of the $45 built-in loss could be 
deducted in Year 2. Because the P group has only $10 of consolidated 
taxable income (determined without regard to the $45), the $25 loss 
creates a consolidated net operating loss of $15. This loss is carried 
back or forward under the rules of Sec. 1.1502-21(b) and absorbed under 
the rules of Sec. 1.1502-21(a). This loss is not treated as arising in 
a SRLY (see Sec. 1.1502-21(c)(1)(ii)) and therefore is not subject to 
the SRLY limitation under Sec. 1.1502-21(c) in any consolidated return 
year of the group to which it is carried. The remaining $20 is treated 
as a loss carryover arising in a SRLY and is subject to the limitation 
of Sec. 1.1502-21(c) in the year to which it is carried.

    (e) Predecessors and successors. For purposes of this section, any 
reference to a corporation or member includes, as the context may 
require, a reference to a successor or predecessor, as defined in Sec. 
1.1502-1(f)(4).
    (f) Built-in losses recognized by common parent of group-- (1) 
General rule. Paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to any loss 
recognized by the group on an asset held by the common parent on the 
date the group is formed. Following an acquisition described in Sec. 
1.1502-75(d)(2) or (3), references to the common parent are to the 
corporation that was the common parent immediately before the 
acquisition.
    (2) Anti-avoidance rule. If a corporation that becomes a common 
parent of a group acquires assets with a net unrealized built-in loss in 
excess of the threshold requirement of section 382(h)(3)(B) (and thereby 
increases its net unrealized built-in loss or decreases its net 
unrealized built-in gain) prior to, and in anticipation of, the 
formation of the group, paragraph (f)(1) of this section does not apply.
    (g) Overlap with section 382--(1) General rule. The limitations 
provided in Sec. Sec. 1.1502-21(c) and 1.1502-22(c) do not apply to 
recognized built-in losses or to loss carryovers or carrybacks 
attributable to recognized built-in losses when the application of 
paragraph (a) of this section results in an overlap with the application 
of section 382.
    (2) Definitions--(i) Generally. For purposes of this paragraph (g), 
the definitions and nomenclature contained in section 382, the 
regulations thereunder, and Sec. Sec. 1.1502-90 through 1.1502-99 
apply.
    (ii) Overlap--(A) An overlap of the application of paragraph (a) of 
this section and the application of section 382 with respect to built-in 
losses occurs if a corporation becomes a member of a consolidated group 
(the SRLY event) within six months of the change date of an ownership 
change giving rise to a section 382(a) limitation that would apply with 
respect to the corporation's recognized built-in losses (the section 382 
event). Except as provided in paragraph (g)(3) of this section, 
application of the overlap rule does not require that the size and 
composition of the corporation's net unrealized built-in loss is the 
same on the date of the section 382 event and the SRLY event.
    (B) For special rules in the event that there is a SRLY subgroup 
and/or a loss subgroup as defined in Sec. 1.1502-91(d)(2) with respect 
to built-in losses, see paragraph (g)(4) of this section.
    (3) Operating rules--(i) Section 382 event before SRLY event. If a 
SRLY event occurs on the same date as a section 382 event or within the 
six month period beginning on the date of the section 382 event, 
paragraph (g)(1) of this section applies beginning with the tax

[[Page 311]]

year that includes the SRLY event. Paragraph (g)(1) of this section does 
not apply, however, if a corporation that would otherwise be subject to 
the overlap rule acquires assets from a person other than a member of 
the group with a net unrealized built-in loss in excess of the threshold 
requirement of section 382(h)(3)(B) (and thereby increases its net 
unrealized built-in loss) after the section 382 event, and before the 
SRLY event.
    (ii) SRLY event before section 382 event. If a section 382 event 
occurs within the period beginning the day after the SRLY event and 
ending six months after the SRLY event, paragraph (g)(1) of this section 
applies starting with the first tax year that begins after the section 
382 event. However, paragraph (g)(1) of this section does not apply at 
any time if a corporation that otherwise would be subject to paragraph 
(g)(1) of this section transfers assets with an unrealized built-in loss 
to another member of the group after the SRLY event, but before the 
section 382 event, unless the corporation recognizes the built-in loss 
upon the transfer.
    (4) Subgroup rules. In general, in the case of built-in losses for 
which there is a SRLY subgroup and the corporations joining the group at 
the time of the SRLY event also constitute a loss subgroup (as defined 
in Sec. 1.1502-91(d)(2)), the principles of this paragraph (g) apply to 
the SRLY subgroup, and not separately to its members. However, paragraph 
(g)(1) of this section applies with respect to built-in losses only if--
    (i) All members of the SRLY subgroup with respect to those built-in 
losses are also included in a loss subgroup (as defined in Sec. 1.1502-
91(d)(2)); and
    (ii) All members of a loss subgroup (as defined in Sec. 1.1502-
91(d)(2)) are also members of a SRLY subgroup with respect to those 
built-in losses.
    (5) Asset acquisitions. Notwithstanding the application of this 
paragraph (g), paragraph (a) of this section applies to asset 
acquisitions by the corporation that occurs after the latter of the SRLY 
event and the section 382 event. See, paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this 
section.
    (6) Examples. The principles of this paragraph (g) are illustrated 
by the following examples:

    Example 1. Determination of subgroup. (i) Individual A owns all of 
the stock of P, P1, and S. In Year 1, P acquires all of the stock of P1, 
and they file a consolidated return. In Year 3, P acquires all of the 
stock of S, and S joins the P group. Individual B, unrelated to 
Individual A, owns all of the stock of M and K, each the common parent 
of a consolidated group. Individual C, unrelated to either Individual A 
or Individual B, owns all of the stock of T.
    (ii) At the beginning of Year 7, M acquires all of the stock of P 
from Individual A, and, as a result, P, P1, and S become members of the 
M group. At the time of M's acquisition of the P stock, P has a $15 net 
unrealized built-in loss (disregarding the stock of P1), P1 has a net 
unrealized built-in gain of $10, and S has a net unrealized built-in 
gain of $5.
    (iii) During Year 8, M acquires all of the stock of T, and T joins 
the M group. At the time of M's acquisition of the T stock, T had an 
unrealized built-in loss of $15. At the beginning of Year 9, K acquires 
all of the stock of M from Individual B, and the members of the M 
consolidated group including P, P1, S, and T become members of the K 
group. At the time of K's acquisition of the M stock, M has 
(disregarding the stock of P and T) a $15 net unrealized built-in loss, 
P has a $20 net unrealized built-in loss (disregarding the stock of P1), 
P1 has a net unrealized built-in gain of $5, S has a net unrealized 
built-in loss of $35, and T has a $15 net unrealized built-in loss.
    (iv) M's acquisition of P in Year 7 results in P, P1, and S becoming 
members of the M group (the SRLY event). Under paragraph (c) of this 
section, P and P1 compose a SRLY built-in loss subgroup because they 
have been affiliated for the 60 consecutive month period immediately 
preceding joining the M group. S is not a member of the subgroup because 
on becoming a member of the M group it had not been continuously 
affiliated with P and P1 for the 60 month period ending immediately 
before it became a member of the M group. Consequently, Sec. 1.1502-15 
applies to S separately from the P and P1 subgroup.
    (v) Assuming that the $5 net unrealized built-in loss of the P/P1 
subgroup exceeds the threshold requirement under section 382(h)(3)(B), 
M's acquisition of P resulted in an ownership change of P and P1 within 
the meaning of section 382(g) that subjects P and P1 to a limitation 
under section 382(a) (the section 382 event). Because, with respect to P 
and P1, the SRLY event and the change date of the section 382 event 
occur on the same date and because the loss subgroup and SRLY subgroup 
are coextensive, there is an overlap of the application of the SRLY 
rules and the application of section 382.

[[Page 312]]

    (vi) S was not a loss corporation because it did not have a net 
operating loss carryover, or a net unrealized built-in loss, and 
therefore, M's acquisition of P did not result in an ownership change of 
S within the meaning of section 382(g). S, therefore is not subject to 
the overlap rule of paragraph (g) of this section.
    (vii) M's acquisition of T resulted in T becoming a member of the M 
group (the SRLY event). Assuming that T's $15 net unrealized built-in 
loss exceeds the threshold requirement under section 382(h)(3)(B), M's 
acquisition of T also resulted in an ownership change of T within the 
meaning of section 382(g) that subjects T to a limitation under section 
382(a) (the section 382 event). Because, with respect to T, the SRLY 
event and the change date of the section 382 event occur on the same 
date, there is an overlap of the application of the SRLY rules and the 
application of section 382 within the meaning of paragraph (g) of this 
section.
    (viii) K's acquisition of M results in the members of the M 
consolidated group, including T, P, P1, and S, becoming members of the K 
group (the SRLY event). Because T, P, and P1 were each included in the 
determination of a net unrealized built-in loss that was subject to the 
overlap rule described in paragraph (g)(1) of this section when they 
each became members of the M group, they are deemed under paragraph 
(c)(3) of this section to have been continuously affiliated with M for 
the 60 month period ending immediately before becoming a member of the M 
group, notwithstanding their actual affiliation history. As a result, M, 
T, P, and P1 compose a SRLY built-in loss subgroup under paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section. K's acquisition of M is not subject to paragraph 
(g) of this section because it does not result in a section 382 event.
    (ix) S, however, is not a member of the subgroup under paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section. Because S was not included in the determination 
of a net unrealized built-in loss that was subject to the overlap rule 
described in paragraph (g)(1) of this section when it joined the M 
group, S is treated as becoming an affiliate of M on the date it joined 
the M group. Furthermore, under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, S is 
deemed to have begun its affiliation with P and P1 on the date it joined 
the M group. Consequently, Sec. 1.1502-15 applies to S separately to 
the extent its built-in loss is recognized within the recognition 
period.
    Example 2. Post-overlap acquisition of assets. (i) Individual A owns 
all of the stock of P, the common parent of a consolidated group. B, an 
individual unrelated to Individual A, owns all of the stock of T. T has 
two depreciable assets. Asset 1 has an unrealized built-in loss of $25 
(basis $75, value $50), and asset 2 has an unrealized built-in gain of 
$20 (basis $30, value $50). During Year 3, P buys all of the stock of T 
from Individual B. On January 1, Year 4, P contributes $80 cash and 
Individual A contributes asset 3, a depreciable asset, with a net 
unrealized built-in loss of $45 (basis $65, value $20), in exchange for 
T stock in a transaction that is described in section 351.
    (ii) P's acquisition of T results in T becoming a member of the P 
group (the SRLY event) and also results in an ownership change of T, 
within the meaning of section 382(g), that gives rise to a limitation 
under section 382(a) (the section 382 event).
    (iii) Because the SRLY event and the change date of the section 382 
event occur on the same date, there is an overlap of the application of 
the SRLY rules and the application of section 382. Consequently, under 
paragraph (g) of this section, the limitation under paragraph (a) of 
this section does not apply to T's net unrealized built-in loss when it 
joined the P group.
    (iv) Individual A's Year 4 contribution of a depreciable asset 
occurred after T was a member of the P group. Assuming that the amount 
of the net unrealized built-in loss exceeds the threshold requirement of 
section 382(h)(3)(B), the sale of asset 3 within the recognition period 
is subject to the SRLY limitation of paragraphs (a) and (b)(2)(ii) of 
this section.
    Example 3. Overlap rule. (i) Individual A owns all of the stock of 
P, the common parent of a consolidated group. B, an individual unrelated 
to Individual A, owns all of the stock of T. T has two depreciable 
assets. Asset 1 has an unrealized loss of $55 (basis $75, value $20), 
and asset 2 has an unrealized gain of $30 (basis $30, value $60). On 
February 28 of Year 2, P purchases 55% of T from Individual B. On June 
30, of Year 2, P purchases an additional 35% of T from Individual B.
    (ii) The February 28 purchase of 55% of T is a section 382 event 
because it results in an ownership change of T that gives rise to a 
section 382(a) limitation. The June 30 purchase of 35% of T results in T 
becoming a member of the P group and is therefore a SRLY event.
    (iii) Because the SRLY event occurred within six months of the 
change date of the section 382 event, there is an overlap of the 
application of the SRLY rules and the application of section 382, and 
paragraph (a) of this section does not apply. Therefore, the SRLY 
limitation does not apply to any of the $55 loss in asset 1 recognized 
by T after T joined the P group. See Sec. 1.1502-94 for rules relating 
to the application of section 382 with respect to T's $25 unrealized 
built-in loss.
    Example 4. Overlap rule-Fluctuation in value. (i) The facts are the 
same as in Example 3, except that by June 30, of Year 2, asset 1 had 
declined in value by a further $10. Thus asset 1 had an unrealized loss 
of $65 (basis $75,

[[Page 313]]

value $10), and asset 2 had an unrealized gain of $30 (basis $30, value 
$60).
    (ii) Because paragraph (a) of this section does not apply, the 
further decrease in asset 1's value is disregarded. Consequently, the 
results are the same as in Example 3.

    (h) Effective date--(1) In general. This section generally applies 
to built-in losses recognized in taxable years for which the due date 
(without extensions) of the consolidated return is after June 25, 1999. 
However--
    (i) In the event that paragraphs (f)(1) and (g)(1) of this section 
do not apply to a particular built-in loss in the current group, then 
solely for purposes of applying paragraph (a) of this section to 
determine a limitation with respect to that built-in loss and with 
respect to which the SRLY register (consolidated taxable income 
determined by reference to only the member's (or subgroup's) items of 
income, gain, deduction, or loss) began in a taxable year for which the 
due date of the return was on or before June 25, 1999, paragraph (c)(3) 
of this section shall not apply; and
    (ii) For purposes of paragraph (g) of this section, only an 
ownership change to which section 382(a) as amended by the Tax Reform 
Act of 1986 applies shall constitute a section 382 event.
    (2) Prior periods. For certain taxable years ending on or before 
June 25, 1999, see Sec. 1.1502-15T in effect prior to June 25, 1999, as 
contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 1999, as applicable.

Sec. 1.1502-16  Mine exploration expenditures.

    (a) Section 617--(1) In general. If the aggregate amount of the 
expenditures to which section 617(a) applies, paid or incurred with 
respect to mines or deposits located outside the United States (as 
defined in section 638 and the regulations thereunder), does not exceed:
    (i) $400,000 minus
    (ii) All amounts deducted or deferred during the taxable year and 
all preceding taxable years under section 617 or section 615 of the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1954 and section 23(ff) of the Internal Revenue 
Code of 1939 by corporations which are members of the group during the 
taxable year (and individuals or corporations which have transferred any 
mineral property to any such member within the meaning of section 
617(g)(2)(B)) for taxable years ending after December 31, 1950 and prior 
to the taxable year, then the deduction under section 617 with respect 
to such foreign expenditures and paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.1502-12 for 
each member shall be no greater than an allocable portion of such amount 
hereinafter referred to as the ``consolidated foreign exploration 
limitation.'' Such allocable portion shall be determined under 
subparagraph (2) of this paragraph. If the amount of such expenditures 
exceeds the consolidated foreign exploration limitation, no deduction 
shall be allowed with respect to such excess.
    (2) Allocable portion of limitation. A member's allocable portion of 
the consolidated foreign exploration limitation for a consolidated 
return year shall be:
    (i) The amount allocated by the common parent pursuant to an 
allocation plan adopted by the consolidated group, but in no event shall 
a member be allocated more than the amount it could have deducted had it 
filed a separate return. Such allocation plan must include a statement 
which also contains the total foreign exploration expenditures of each 
member which could have been deducted under section 617 if the member 
had filed a separate return. Such plan must be attached to a 
consolidated return filed on or before the due date of such return 
(including extensions of time), and may not be changed after such date, 
or
    (ii) If no plan is filed in accordance with subdivision (i) of this 
subparagraph, then the portion of the consolidated foreign exploration 
limitation allocable to each member incurring such expenditures is an 
amount equal to such limitation multiplied by a fraction, the numerator 
of which is the amount of foreign exploration expenditures which could 
have been deducted under section 617 by such member had it filed a 
separate return and the denominator of which is the aggregate of such 
amounts for all members of the group.

[[Page 314]]

    (b) Section 615--(1) In general. If the aggregate amount of the 
expenditures, to which section 615(a) applies, which are paid or 
incurred by the members of the group during any consolidated return year 
exceeds the lesser of:
    (i) $100,000, or
    (ii) $400,000 minus all such expenditures deducted (or deferred) by 
corporations which are members of the group during the taxable year (and 
individuals or corporations which have transferred any mineral property 
to any such member within the meaning of section 615(c)(2)(B)) for 
taxable years ending after December 31, 1950, and prior to the taxable 
year, then the deduction (or amount deferrable) under section 615 and 
paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.1502-12 for each member shall be no greater 
than an allocable portion of such lesser amount, hereinafter referred to 
as the ``consolidated exploration limitation''. Such allocable portion 
shall be determined under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.
    (2) Allocable portion of limitation. A member's allocable portion of 
the consolidated exploration limitation for a consolidated return year 
shall be:
    (i) The amount allocated by the common parent pursuant to an 
allocation plan adopted by the consolidated group, but in no event shall 
a member be allocated more than the amount it could have deducted (or 
deferred) had it filed a separate return. Such allocation plan must 
include a statement which also contains the total exploration 
expenditures of each member for the taxable year, and the expenditures 
of each member which could have been deducted (or deferred) under 
section 615 if the member had filed a separate return. Such plan must be 
attached to a consolidated return filed on or before the due date of 
such return (including extensions of time), and may not be changed after 
such date, or
    (ii) If no plan is filed in accordance with subdivision (i) of this 
subparagraph, then the portion of the consolidated exploration 
limitation allocable to each member incurring such expenditures is an 
amount equal to such limitation multiplied by a fraction, the numerator 
of which is the amount which could have been deducted (or deferred) 
under section 615 by such member had it filed a separate return and the 
denominator of which is the aggregate of such amounts for all members of 
the group.
    (c) Examples. The provisions of this section may be illustrated by 
the following examples:

    Example (1). Corporation X and its wholly owned subsidiaries, 
corporations Y and Z, file a consolidated return for the calendar year 
1971. None of the corporations have incurred exploration expenditures 
described in section 617 in previous years. During 1971, X incurred 
foreign exploration expenditures of $30,000, Y of $20,000, and Z of 
$40,000. The amount of foreign exploration expenditures deductible under 
section 617 for purposes of computing separate taxable income under 
Sec. 1.1502-12 will be the amount actually expended by each 
corporation.
    Example (2). Assume the same facts as in example (1) except that 
prior to 1971, X, Y, and Z had deducted (or deferred) under section 615 
and 617 a total of $300,000 of exploration expenditures. During 1971, 
with respect to deposits located outside the United States X incurred 
exploration expenditures of $25,000, Y of $75,000, and Z of $125,000. 
The consolidated exploration limitation under paragraph (a) of this 
section with respect to the foreign deposits (there is no limitation 
with respect to the domestic expenditures) is $100,000. X may allocate 
the $100,000 in any manner among the three members, except that X may 
not be allocated more than $25,000 nor Y more than $75,000, the amount 
actually expended by X and Y and which they could have deducted had they 
each filed a separate return. If the allocation is not made in 
accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, the $100,000 
limitation will be allocated under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section 
as follows:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                                                       Allocable
                         Corporation                           Expenditure   Fraction    Limitation     portion
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               ...........      25,000
X............................................................      $25,000    ------      x$100,000=     $12,500
                                                               ...........     200,000
 
                                                               ...........      75,000
Y............................................................      $75,000    ------      x$100,000=     $37,500
                                                               ...........     200,000
 
                                                               ...........     100,000

[[Page 315]]

 
Z............................................................     $125,000    ------      x$100,000=     $50,000
                                                               ...........     200,000
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The denominator of $200,000 was calculated as follows:

    X=$25,000
    Y=$75,000
    Z=$100,000 (maximum amount allowed if filed separately)
Total $200,000.
    Example (3). Assume the same facts as in example (2) and that on 
January 1, 1971, X acquired all of the stock of corporation T which 
prior to its taxable year beginning January 1, 1971, had previously 
deducted (or deferred) $310,000 of exploration expenditures. Assume 
further that in 1971 X incurred $25,000 of foreign exploration 
expenditures, Y $50,000, T $50,000, and Z none. A consolidated return is 
filed for 1971. None of the expenditures may be deducted under section 
617 since the consolidated exploration limitation is zero. The 
limitation is zero since the aggregate amount of previously deducted (or 
deferred) exploration expenditures by the members of the group exceeds 
$400,000. (The total of such expenditures is $410,000, of which $310,000 
is attributable to T and, assuming the allocation of the limitation in 
example (2) is made under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, $12,500 
is attributable to X, $37,500 to Y, and $50,000 to Z.
    Example (4). Assume the same facts as in example (3) except that on 
December 31, 1971, X sold all of the stock in Z to an unrelated party. 
The consolidated exploration limitation for 1972 will be $40,000, 
computed by subtracting from $400,000, the aggregate amount of 
previously deducted (or deferred) exploration expenditures incurred by 
the members of the group prior to 1972. (The total of such expenditures 
is $360,000, of which $12,500 is attributable to X, $37,500 to Y and 
$310,000 to T.) Amounts previously deducted (or deferred) by Z are not 
taken into account since it was not a member of the group at any time 
during 1972. Amounts previously deducted (or deferred) by Z shall be 
taken into account by it for subsequent separate return years.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1502-17  Methods of accounting.

    (a) General rule. The method of accounting to be used by each member 
of the group shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of 
section 446 as if such member filed a separate return. For treatment of 
depreciable property after a transfer within the group, see paragraph 
(g) of Sec. 1.1502-12.
    (b) Adjustments required if method of accounting changes--(1) 
General rule. If a member of a group changes its method of accounting 
for a consolidated return year, the terms and conditions prescribed by 
the Commissioner under section 446(e), including section 481(a) where 
applicable, shall apply to the member. If the requirements of section 
481(b) are met because applicable adjustments under section 481(a) are 
substantial, the increase in tax for any prior year shall be computed 
upon the basis of a consolidated return or a separate return, whichever 
was filed for such prior year.
    (2) Changes in method of accounting for intercompany transactions. 
If a member changes its method of accounting for intercompany 
transactions for a consolidated return year, the change in method 
generally will be effected on a cut-off basis.
    (c) Anti-avoidance rules--(1) General rule. If one member (B) 
directly or indirectly acquires an activity of another member (S), or 
undertakes S's activity, with the principal purpose to avail the group 
of an accounting method that would be unavailable (or would be 
unavailable without securing consent from the Commissioner) if S and B 
were treated as divisions of a single corporation, B must use the 
accounting method for the acquired or undertaken activity determined 
under paragraph (c)(2) of this section or must secure consent from the 
Commissioner under applicable administrative procedures to use a 
different method.
    (2) Treatment as divisions of a single corporation. B must use the 
method of accounting that would be required if B acquired the activity 
from S in a transaction to which section 381 applied. Thus, the 
principles of section 381 (c)(4) and (c)(5) apply to resolve any 
conflicts between the accounting methods of S and B, and the acquired or 
undertaken activity is treated as having the accounting method used by 
S. Appropriate adjustments are made to treat all acquisitions or 
undertakings that

[[Page 316]]

are part of the same plan or arrangement as a single acquisition or 
undertaking.
    (d) Examples. The provisions of this section are illustrated by the 
following examples:

    Example 1. Separate return treatment generally. X and its wholly-
owned subsidiary Y filed separate returns for their calendar years 
ending December 31, 1965. During calendar year 1965, X employed an 
accrual method of accounting, established a reserve for bad debts, and 
elected under section 171 to amortize bond premiums with respect to its 
fully taxable bonds. During calendar year 1965, Y employed the cash 
receipts and disbursements method, used the specific charge-off method 
with respect to its bad debts, and did not elect to amortize bond 
premiums under section 171 with respect to its bonds. X and Y filed a 
consolidated return for 1966. For 1966 X and Y must continue to compute 
income under their respective methods of accounting (unless a change in 
method under section 446 is made).
    Example 2. Adopting methods. Corporation P is a member of a 
consolidated group. P provides consulting services to customers under 
various agreements. For one type of customer, P's agreements require 
payment only when the contract is completed (payment-on-completion 
contracts). P uses an overall accrual method of accounting. Accordingly, 
P takes its income from consulting contracts into account when earned, 
received, or due, whichever is earlier. With the principal purpose to 
avoid seeking the consent of the Commissioner to change its method of 
accounting for the payment-on-completion contracts to the cash method, P 
forms corporation S, and S begins to render services to those customers 
subject to the payment-on-completion contracts. P continues to render 
services to those customers not subject to these contracts.
    (b) Under paragraph (c) of this section, S must account for the 
consulting income under the payment-on-completion contracts on an 
accrual method rather than adopting the cash method contemplated by P.
    Example 3. Changing inventory sub-method. (a) Corporation P is a 
member of a consolidated group. P operates a manufacturing business that 
uses dollar-value LIFO, and has built up a substantial LIFO reserve. P 
has historically manufactured all its inventory and has used one natural 
business unit pool. P begins purchasing goods identical to its own 
finished goods from a foreign supplier, and is concerned that it must 
establish a separate resale pool under Sec. 1.472-8(c). P anticipates 
that it will begin to purchase, rather than manufacture, a substantial 
portion of its inventory, resulting in a recapture of most of its LIFO 
reserve because of decrements in its manufacturing pool. With the 
principal purpose to avoid the decrements, P forms corporation S in Year 
1. S operates as a distributor to nonmembers, and P sells all of its 
existing inventories to S. S adopts LIFO, and elects dollar-value LIFO 
with one resale pool. Thereafter, P continues to manufacture and 
purchase inventory, and to sell it to S for resale to nonmembers. P's 
intercompany gain from sales to S is taken into account under Sec. 
1.1502-13. S maintains its Year 1 base dollar value of inventory so that 
P will not be required to take its intercompany items (which include the 
effects of the LIFO reserve recapture) into account.
    (b) Under paragraph (c) of this section, S must maintain two pools 
(manufacturing and resale) to the same extent that P would be required 
to maintain those pools under Sec. 1.472-8 if it had not formed S.

    (e) Effective dates. Paragraph (b) of this section applies to 
changes in method of accounting effective for years beginning on or 
after July 12, 1995. For changes in method of accounting effective for 
years beginning before that date, see Sec. 1.1502-17 (as contained in 
the 26 CFR part 1 edition revised as of April 1, 1995). Paragraphs (c) 
and (d) apply with respect to acquisitions occurring or activities 
undertaken in years beginning on or after July 12, 1995.

[T.D. 6894, 31 FR 11794, Sept. 8, 1966, as amended by T.D. 8597, 60 FR 
36708, July 18, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 1.1502-18  Inventory adjustment.

    (a) Definition of intercompany profit amount. For purposes of this 
section, the term ``intercompany profit amount'' for a taxable year 
means an amount equal to the profits of a corporation (other than those 
profits which such corporation has elected not to defer pursuant to 
Sec. 1.1502- 13(c)(3) or which have been taken into account pursuant to 
Sec. 1.1502-13(f)(1)(viii)) arising in transactions with other members 
of the group with respect to goods which are, at the close of such 
corporation's taxable year, included in the inventories of any member of 
the group. See Sec. 1.1502-13(c)(2) with respect to the determination 
of profits. See the last sentence of Sec. 1.1502-13(f)(1)(i) for rules 
for determining which goods are considered to be disposed of outside the 
group and therefore not included in inventories of members.

[[Page 317]]

    (b) Addition of initial inventory amount to taxable income. If a 
corporation:
    (1) Is a member of a group filing a consolidated return for the 
taxable year,
    (2) Was a member of such group for its immediately preceding taxable 
year, and
    (3) Filed a separate return for such preceding year,

then the intercompany profit amount of such corporation for such 
separate return year (hereinafter referred to as the ``initial inventory 
amount'') shall be added to the income of such corporation for the 
consolidated return year (or years) in which the goods to which the 
initial inventory amount is attributable are disposed of outside the 
group or such corporation becomes a nonmember. Such amount shall be 
treated as gain from the sale or exchange of property which is neither a 
capital asset nor property described in section 1231.
    (c) Recovery of initial inventory amount--(1) Unrecovered inventory 
amount. The term ``unrecovered inventory amount'' for any consolidated 
return year means the lesser of:
    (i) The intercompany profit amount for such year, or
    (ii) The initial inventory amount.

However, if a corporation ceases to be a member of the group during a 
consolidated return year, its unrecovered inventory amount for such year 
shall be considered to be zero.
    (2) Recovery during consolidated return years. (i) To the extent 
that the unrecovered inventory amount of a corporation for a 
consolidated return year is less than such amount for its immediately 
preceding year, such decrease shall be treated for such year by such 
corporation as a loss from the sale or exchange of property which is 
neither a capital asset nor property described in section 1231.
    (ii) To the extent that the unrecovered inventory amount for a 
consolidated return year exceeds such amount for the preceding year, 
such increase shall be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of 
property which is neither a capital asset nor property described in 
section 1231.
    (3) Recovery during first separate return year. For the first 
separate return year of a member following a consolidated return year, 
the unrecovered inventory amount for such consolidated return year 
(minus any part of the initial inventory amount which has not been added 
to income pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section) shall be treated as 
a loss from the sale or exchange of property which is neither a capital 
asset nor property described in section 1231.
    (4) Acquisition of group. For purposes of this section, a member of 
a group shall not become a nonmember or be considered as filing a 
separate return solely because of a termination of the group 
(hereinafter referred to as the ``terminating group'') resulting from:
    (i) The acquisition by a nonmember corporation of (a) the assets of 
the common parent in a reorganization described in subparagraph (A), 
(C), or (D) (but only if the requirements of subparagraphs (A) and (B) 
of section 354(b)(1) are met) of section 368 (a)(1), or (b) stock of the 
common parent, or
    (ii) The acquisition (in a transaction to which Sec. 1.1502-
75(d)(3) applies) by a member of (a) the assets of a nonmember 
corporation in a reorganization referred to in subdivision (i) of this 
subparagraph, or (b) stock of a nonmember corporation,

if all the members of the terminating group (other than such common 
parent if its assets are acquired) immediately before the acquisition 
are members immediately after the acquisition of another group 
(hereinafter referred to as the ``succeeding group'') which files a 
consolidated return for the first taxable year ending after the date of 
acquisition. The members of the succeeding group shall succeed to any 
initial inventory amount and to any unrecovered inventory amount of 
members of the terminating group. This subparagraph shall not apply with 
respect to acquisitions occurring before August 25, 1971.
    (d) Examples. The provisions of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this 
section may be illustrated by the following examples:

    Example (1). Corporations P, S, and T report income on the basis of 
a calendar year. Such corporations file separate returns for 1965. P 
manufactures widgets which it sells to both S and T, who act as 
distributors. The inventories of S and T at the close of 1965 are

[[Page 318]]

comprised of widgets which they purchased from P and with respect to 
which P derived profits of $5,000 and $8,000, respectively. P, S, and T 
file a consolidated return for 1966. During 1966, P sells widgets to S 
and T with respect to which it derives profits of $7,000 and $10,000, 
respectively. The inventories of S and T as of December 31, 1966, are 
comprised of widgets on which P derived net profits of $4,000 and 
$8,000, respectively. P's initial inventory amount is $13,000, P's 
intercompany profit amount for 1965 (such $13,000 amount is the profits 
of P with respect to goods sold to S and T and included in their 
inventories at the close of 1965). Assuming that S and T identify their 
goods on a first-in, first-out basis, the entire opening inventory 
amount of $13,000 is added to P's income for 1966 as gain from the sale 
or exchange of property which is neither a capital asset nor properly 
described in section 1231, since the goods to which the initial 
inventory amount is attributable were disposed of in 1966 outside the 
group. However, since P's unrecovered inventory amount for 1966, $12,000 
(the intercompany profit amount for the year, which is less than the 
initial inventory amount), is less than the unrecovered inventory amount 
for 1965, $13,000, this decrease of $1,000 is treated by P for 1966 as a 
loss from the sale or exchange of property which is neither a capital 
asset nor property described in section 1231.
    Example (2). Assume the same facts as in example (1) and that at the 
close of 1967, a consolidated return year, the inventories of S and T 
are comprised of widgets on which P derived profits of $5,000 and 
$3,000, respectively. Since P's unrecovered inventory amount for 1967, 
$8,000, is less than $12,000, the unrecovered inventory amount for 1966, 
this decrease of $4,000 is treated by P for 1967 as a loss from the sale 
or exchange of property which is neither a capital asset nor property 
described in section 1231.
    Example (3). Assume the same facts as in examples (1) and (2) and 
that in 1968, a consolidated return year, P's intercompany profit amount 
is $11,000. P will report $3,000 (the excess of $11,000, P's unrecovered 
inventory amount for 1968, over $8,000, P's unrecovered inventory amount 
for 1967) for 1968 as a gain from the sale or exchange of property which 
is neither a capital asset nor property described in section 1231.
    Example (4). Assume the same facts as in examples (1), (2), and (3) 
and that in 1969 P, S, and T file separate returns. P will report 
$11,000 (its unrecovered inventory amount for 1968, $11,000, minus the 
portion of the initial inventory amount which has not been added to 
income during 1966, 1967, and 1968, zero) as a loss from the sale or 
exchange of property which is neither a capital asset nor property 
described in section 1231.
    Example (5). Corporations P and S file a consolidated return for the 
first time for the calendar year 1966. P manufactures machines and sells 
them to S, which sells them to users throughout the country. At the 
close of 1965, S has on hand 20 machines which it purchased from P and 
with respect to which P derived profits of $3,500. During 1966, P sells 
6 machines to S on which it derives profits of $1,300, and S sells 5 
machines which it had on hand at the beginning of the year (S 
specifically identifies the machines which it sells) and on which P had 
derived profits of $900. P's initial inventory amount is $3,500, of 
which $900 is added to P's income in 1966 as gain from the sale or 
exchange of property which is neither a capital asset nor property 
described in section 1231, since such $900 amount is attributable to 
goods disposed of in 1966 outside the group, which goods were included 
in S's inventory at the close of 1965. If P and S continue to file 
consolidated returns, the remaining $2,600 of the initial inventory 
amount will be added to P's income as the machines on which such profits 
were derived are disposed of outside the group.
    Example (6). Assume that in example (5) S had elected to inventory 
its goods under section 472 (relating to last-in, first-out 
inventories). None of P's initial inventory amount of $3,500 would be 
added to P's income in 1966, since none of the goods to which such 
amount is attributable would be considered to be disposed of during such 
year under the last-in, first-out method of identifying inventories.

    (e) Section 381 transfer. If a member of the group is a transferor 
or distributor of assets to another member of the group within the 
meaning of section 381(a), then the acquiring corporation shall be 
treated as succeeding to the initial inventory amount of the transferor 
or distributor corporation to the extent that as of the date of 
distribution or transfer such amount has not yet been added to income. 
Such amount shall then be added to the acquiring corporation's income 
under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section. For purposes of 
applying paragraph (c) of this section:
    (1) The initial inventory amount of the transferor or distributor 
corporation shall be added to such amount of the acquiring corporation 
as of the close of the acquiring corporation's taxable year in which the 
date of distribution or transfer occurs, and
    (2) The unrecovered inventory amount of the transferor or 
distributor corporation for its taxable year preceding the taxable year 
of the group in

[[Page 319]]

which the date of distribution or transfer occurs shall be added to such 
amount of the acquiring corporation.
    (f) Transitional rules for years before 1966--(1) In general. If:
    (i) A group filed a consolidated return for the taxable year 
immediately preceding the first taxable year to which this section 
applies,
    (ii) Any member of such group made an opening adjustment to its 
inventory pursuant to paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.1502-39A (as contained in 
the 26 CFR edition revised as of April 1, 1996), and
    (iii) Paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.1502-39A (as contained in the 26 CFR 
edition revised as of April 1, 1996), has not been applicable for any 
taxable year subsequent to the taxable year for which such adjustment 
was made,

then subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph shall apply.
    (2) Closing adjustment to inventory. (i) For the first consolidated 
return year to which this section applies, the increase in inventory 
prescribed in paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.1502-39A (as contained in the 26 
CFR edition revised as of April 1, 1996), shall be made as if such year 
were a separate return year.
    (ii) For the first separate return year of a member to which this 
section applies, the adjustment to inventory (whether an increase or a 
decrease) prescribed in paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.1502-39A (as contained 
in the 26 CFR edition revised as of April 1, 1996), minus any adjustment 
already made pursuant to subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, shall be 
made to the inventory of such member.
    (3) Addition and recovery of initial inventory amount. Each selling 
member shall treat as an initial inventory amount its share of the net 
amount by which the inventories of all members are increased pursuant to 
subparagraph (2)(i) of this paragraph for the first taxable year to 
which this section applies. A member's share shall be such net amount 
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is its initial 
inventory amount (computed under paragraph (b) as if such taxable year 
were its first consolidated return year), and the denominator of which 
is the sum of such initial inventory amounts of all members. Such 
initial inventory amount shall be added to the income of such selling 
member and shall be recovered at the time and in the manner prescribed 
in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
    (4) Example. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by 
the following example:

    Example. (i) Corporations P, S, and T file consolidated returns for 
calendar 1966, having filed consolidated returns continuously since 
1962. P is a wholesale distributor of groceries selling to chains of 
supermarkets, including those owned by S and T. The opening inventories 
of S and T for 1962 were reduced by $40,000 and $80,000, respectively, 
pursuant to paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.1502-39A (as contained in the 26 
CFR edition revised as of April 1, 1996). At the close of 1965, S and T 
have on hand in their inventories goods on which P derived profits of 
$80,000 and $90,000, respectively. The inventories of S and T at the 
close of 1966 include goods which they purchased from P during the year 
on which P derived profits of $85,000 and $105,000, respectively.
    (ii) The opening inventories of S and T for 1966, the first year to 
which this section applies, are increased by $40,000 and $80,000, 
respectively, pursuant to the provisions of subparagraph (2)(i) of this 
paragraph. P will take into account (as provided in paragraphs (b) and 
(c) of this section) an initial inventory amount of $120,000 as of the 
beginning of 1966, the net amount by which the inventories of S and T 
were increased in such year. Since the increases in the inventories of S 
and T are the maximum allowable under paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.1502-39A 
(as contained in the 26 CFR edition revised as of April 1, 1996) (i.e., 
the amount by which such inventories were originally decreased), no 
further adjustments will be made pursuant to subparagraph (2)(ii) of 
this paragraph to such inventories in the event that separate returns 
are subsequently filed.

    (5) Election not to eliminate. If a group filed a consolidated 
return for the taxable year immediately preceding the first taxable year 
to which this section applies, and for such preceding year the members 
of the group did not eliminate gain or loss on intercompany inventory 
transactions pursuant to the adoption under Sec. 1.1502-31A(b)(1) (as 
contained in the 26 CFR edition revised as of April 1, 1996) of a 
consistent accounting practice taking into account such gain or loss, 
then for purposes of this section each member shall be treated as if it 
had filed a separate return for such immediately preceding year.

[[Page 320]]

    (g) Transitional rules for years beginning on or after July 12, 
1995. Paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section do not apply for 
taxable years beginning on or after July 12, 1995. Any remaining 
unrecovered inventory amount of a member under paragraph (c) of this 
section is recovered in the first taxable year beginning on or after 
July 12, 1995, under the principles of paragraph (c)(3) of this section 
by treating the first taxable year as the first separate return year of 
the member. The unrecovered inventory amount can be recovered only to 
the extent it was previously included in taxable income. The principles 
of this section apply, with appropriate adjustments, to comparable 
amounts under paragraph (f) of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1502-19  Excess loss accounts.

    (a) In general--(1) Purpose. This section provides rules for a 
member (P) to include in income its excess loss account in the stock of 
another member (S). The purpose of the excess loss account is to 
recapture in consolidated taxable income P's negative adjustments with 
respect to S's stock (e.g., under Sec. 1.1502-32 from S's deductions, 
losses, and distributions), to the extent the negative adjustments 
exceed P's basis in the stock.
    (2) Excess loss accounts--(i) In general. P's basis in S's stock is 
adjusted under the consolidated return regulations and other rules of 
law. Negative adjustments may exceed P's basis in S's stock. The 
resulting negative amount is P's excess loss account in S's stock. For 
example:
    (A) Once P's negative adjustments under Sec. 1.1502-32 exceed its 
basis in S's stock, the excess is P's excess loss account in the S 
stock. If P has further adjustments, they first increase or decrease the 
excess loss account.
    (B) If P forms S by transferring property subject to liabilities in 
excess of basis, Sec. 1.1502-80(d) provides for the nonapplicability of 
section 357(c) and the resulting negative basis under section 358 is P's 
excess loss account in the S stock.
    (ii) Treatment as negative basis. P's excess loss account is treated 
for all Federal income tax purposes as basis that is a negative amount, 
and a reference to P's basis in S's stock includes a reference to P's 
excess loss account.
    (3) Application of other rules of law. The rules of this section are 
in addition to other rules of law. See, e.g., Sec. Sec. 1.1502-32 
(investment adjustment rules establishing and adjusting excess loss 
accounts) and 1.1502-80(d) (nonapplicability of section 357(c)). The 
provisions of this section and other rules of law must not be applied to 
recapture the same amount more than once. For purposes of this section, 
the definitions in Sec. 1.1502-32 apply.
    (b) Excess loss account taken into account as income or gain--(1) 
[Reserved]. For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1502-19T(b)(1).
    (2) Nonrecognition or deferral--(i) In general. P's income or gain 
under paragraph (b)(1) of this section is subject to any nonrecognition 
or deferral rules applicable to the disposition. For example, if S 
liquidates and the exchange of P's stock in S is subject to section 332, 
or P transfers all of its assets (including S's stock) to S in a 
reorganization to which section 361(a) applies, P's income or gain from 
the excess loss account is not recognized under these rules.
    (ii) Nonrecognition or deferral inapplicable. If P's income or gain 
under paragraph (b)(1) of this section is from a disposition described 
in paragraph (c)(1) (ii) or (iii) of this section (relating to 
deconsolidations and worthlessness), the income or gain is taken into 
account notwithstanding any nonrecognition or deferral rules (even if 
the disposition is also described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this 
section). For example, if P transfers S's stock to a nonmember in a 
transaction to which section 351 applies, P's income or gain from the 
excess loss account is taken into account.
    (3) Tiering up in chains. If the stock of more than one subsidiary 
is disposed of in the same transaction, the income or gain under this 
section is taken into account in the order of the tiers, from the lowest 
to the highest.

[[Page 321]]

    (4) Insolvency--(i) In general. Gain under this section is treated 
as ordinary income to the extent of the amount by which S is insolvent 
(within the meaning of section 108(d)(3)) immediately before the 
disposition. For this purpose S's liabilities include any amount to 
which preferred stock would be entitled if S were liquidated immediately 
before the disposition, and any former liabilities that were discharged 
to the extent the discharge was treated as tax-exempt income under Sec. 
1.1502-32(b)(3)(ii)(C) (special rule for discharges).
    (ii) Reduction for amount of distributions. The amount treated as 
ordinary income under this paragraph (b)(4) is reduced to the extent it 
exceeds the amount of P's excess loss account redetermined without 
taking into account S's distributions to P to which Sec. 1.1502-
32(b)(2)(iv) applies.
    (c) Disposition of stock. For purposes of this section:
    (1) In general. P is treated as disposing of a share of S's stock:
    (i) Transfer, cancellation, etc. At the time--
    (A) P transfers or otherwise ceases to own the share for Federal 
income tax purposes, even if no gain or loss is taken into account; or
    (B) P takes into account gain or loss (in whole or in part) with 
respect to the share.
    (ii) Deconsolidation. At the time--
    (A) P becomes a nonmember, or a nonmember determines its basis in 
the share (or any other asset) by reference to P's basis in the share, 
directly or indirectly, in whole or in part (e.g., under section 362); 
or
    (B) S becomes a nonmember, or P's basis in the share is reflected, 
directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, in the basis of any asset 
other than member stock (e.g., under section 1071).
    (iii) Worthlessness. At the time--
    (A) Substantially all of S's assets are treated as disposed of, 
abandoned, or destroyed for Federal income tax purposes (e.g., under 
section 165(a) or Sec. 1.1502-80(c), or, if S's asset is stock of a 
lower-tier member, the stock is treated as disposed of under this 
paragraph (c)). An asset of S is not considered to be disposed of or 
abandoned to the extent the disposition is in complete liquidation of S 
or is in exchange for consideration (other than relief from 
indebtedness);
    (B) An indebtedness of S is discharged, if any part of the amount 
discharged is not included in gross income and is not treated as tax-
exempt income under Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(3)(ii)(C); or
    (C) A member takes into account a deduction or loss for the 
uncollectibility of an indebtedness of S, and the deduction or loss is 
not matched in the same tax year by S's taking into account a 
corresponding amount of income or gain from the indebtedness in 
determining consolidated taxable income.
    (2) Becoming a nonmember. A member is treated as becoming a 
nonmember if it has a separate return year (including another group's 
consolidated return year). For example, S may become a nonmember if it 
issues additional stock to nonmembers, but S does not become a nonmember 
as a result of its complete liquidation. A disposition under paragraph 
(c)(1)(ii) of this section must be taken into account in the 
consolidated return of the group. For example, if a group ceases under 
Sec. 1.1502-75(c) to file a consolidated return as of the close of its 
consolidated return year, the disposition under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of 
this section is treated as occurring immediately before the close of the 
year. If S becomes a nonmember because P sells S's stock to a nonmember, 
P's sale is a disposition under both paragraphs (c)(1) (i) and (ii) of 
this section. If a group terminates under Sec. 1.1502-75(d) because the 
common parent is the only remaining member, the common parent is not 
treated as having a deconsolidation event under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of 
this section.
    (3) Exception for acquisition of group--(i) Application. This 
paragraph (c)(3) applies only if a consolidated group (the terminating 
group) ceases to exist as a result of--
    (A) The acquisition by a member of another consolidated group of 
either the assets of the common parent of the terminating group in a 
reorganization described in section 381(a)(2), or the stock of the 
common parent of the terminating group; or

[[Page 322]]

    (B) The application of the principles of Sec. 1.1502-75(d)(2) or 
(d)(3).
    (ii) General rule. Paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section does not 
apply solely by reason of the termination of a group in a transaction to 
which this paragraph (c)(3) applies, if there is a surviving group that 
is, immediately thereafter, a consolidated group. Instead, the surviving 
group is treated as the terminating group for purposes of applying this 
section to the terminating group. This treatment does not apply, 
however, to members of the terminating group that are not members of the 
surviving group immediately after the terminating group ceases to exist 
(e.g., under section 1504(a)(3) relating to reconsolidation, or section 
1504(c) relating to includible insurance companies).
    (d) Special allocation of basis adjustments or determinations. If a 
member has an excess loss account in shares of a class of S's stock at 
the time of a basis adjustment or determination under the Internal 
Revenue Code with respect to other shares of the same class of S's stock 
owned by the member, the adjustment or determination is allocated first 
to equalize and eliminate that member's excess loss account. For 
example, if P owns 50 shares of S's only class of stock with a $100 
basis and 50 shares with a $100 excess loss account, and P contributes 
$200 to S without receiving additional shares, the contribution first 
eliminates P's excess loss account, then increases P's basis in each 
share by $1. (If P transfers the $200 in exchange for an additional 100 
shares of S's stock in a transaction to which section 351 applies, P's 
excess loss account is first eliminated, and P's basis in the additional 
shares is $100.) See Sec. 1.1502-32(c) for similar allocations of 
investment adjustments to prevent or eliminate excess loss accounts.
    (e) Anti-avoidance rule. If any person acts with a principal purpose 
contrary to the purposes of this section, to avoid the effect of the 
rules of this section or apply the rules of this section to avoid the 
effect of any other provision of the consolidated return regulations, 
adjustments must be made as necessary to carry out the purposes of this 
section.
    (f) Predecessors and successors. For purposes of this section, any 
reference to a corporation (or to a share of the corporation's stock) 
includes a reference to a successor or predecessor (or to a share of 
stock of a predecessor or successor), as the context may require.
    (g) Examples. For purposes of the examples in this section, unless 
otherwise stated, P owns all 100 shares of the only class of S's stock 
and S owns all 100 shares of the only class of T's stock, the stock is 
owned for the entire year, T owns no stock of lower-tier members, the 
tax year of all persons is the calendar year, all persons use the 
accrual method of accounting, the facts set forth the only corporate 
activity, all transactions are between unrelated persons, and tax 
liabilities are disregarded. The principles of this section are 
illustrated by the following examples.

    Example 1. Taxable disposition of stock. (a) Facts. P has a $150 
basis in S's stock, and S has a $100 basis in T's stock. For Year 1, P 
has $500 of ordinary income, S has no income or loss, and T has a $200 
ordinary loss. S sells T's stock to a nonmember for $60 at the close of 
Year 1.
    (b) Analysis. Under paragraph (c) of this section, the sale is a 
disposition of T's stock at the close of Year 1 (the day of the sale). 
Under Sec. 1.1502-32(b), T's loss results in S having a $100 excess 
loss account in T's stock immediately before the sale. Under paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section, S takes into account the $100 excess loss 
account as an additional $100 of gain from the sale. Consequently, S 
takes into account a $160 gain from the sale in determining the group's 
consolidated taxable income. Under Sec. 1.1502-32(b), T's $200 loss and 
S's $160 gain result in a net $40 decrease in P's basis in S's stock as 
of the close of Year 1, from $150 to $110.
    (c) Intercompany sale followed by sale to nonmember. The facts are 
the same as in paragraph (a) of this Example 1, except that S sells T's 
stock to P for $60 at the close of Year 1, and P sells T's stock to a 
nonmember at a gain at the beginning of Year 5. Under paragraph (c) of 
this section, S's sale is treated as a disposition of T's stock at the 
close of Year 1 (the day of the sale). Under Sec. 1.1502-13 and 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section, S's $160 gain from the sale is 
deferred and taken into account in Year 5 as a result of P's sale of the 
T stock. Under Sec. 1.1502-32(b), the absorption of T's $200 loss in 
Year 1 results in P having a $50 excess loss account in S's stock at the 
close of Year 1. In Year 5, S's $160 gain taken into account eliminates 
P's excess loss account in S's stock and increases P's basis in the 
stock to $110.

[[Page 323]]

    (d) Intercompany distribution followed by sale to a nonmember. The 
facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this Example 1, except that 
the value of the T stock is $60 and S declares and distributes a 
dividend of all of the T stock to P at the close of Year 1, and P sells 
the T stock to a nonmember at a gain at the beginning of Year 5. Under 
paragraph (c) of this section, S's distribution is treated as a 
disposition of T's stock at the close of Year 1 (the day of the 
distribution). S's $100 excess loss account in T's stock is treated as 
additional gain under section 311(b) from the distribution. Under 
section 301(d), P's basis in the T stock is $60. Under Sec. 1.1502-13, 
and paragraph (b)(2) of this section, S's $160 gain from the 
distribution is deferred and taken into account in Year 5 as a result of 
P's sale of the T stock. Under Sec. 1.1502-32(b), T's $200 loss and S's 
$60 distribution result in P having a $110 excess loss account in S's 
stock at the close of Year 1. In Year 5, S's $160 gain taken into 
account eliminates P's excess loss account in S's stock and increases 
P's basis in the stock to $50.
    Example 2. Basis determinations under the Internal Revenue Code in 
intercompany reorganizations. (a) Facts. P owns all of the stock of S 
and T. P has a $150 basis in S's stock and a $100 excess loss account in 
T's stock. P transfers T's stock to S without receiving additional S 
stock, in a transaction to which section 351 applies.
    (b) Analysis. Under paragraph (c) of this section, P's transfer is 
treated as a disposition of T's stock. Under section 351 and paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section, P does not recognize gain from the disposition. 
Under section 358 and paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, P's $100 
excess loss account in T's stock decreases P's $150 basis in S's stock 
to $50. In addition, S takes a $100 excess loss account in T's stock 
under section 362. (If P had received additional S stock, paragraph (d) 
of this section would not apply to shift basis from P's original S stock 
because the basis of the original stock is not adjusted or determined as 
a result of the contribution; but paragraph (d) would apply to shift 
basis if P had transferred S's stock to T in exchange for additional T 
stock, because the basis of the additional T stock would be determined 
when P has an excess loss account in its original T stock.)
    (c) Intercompany merger. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) 
of this Example 2, except that T merges into S in a reorganization 
described in section 368(a)(1)(A) (and in section 368(a)(1)(D)), and P 
receives no additional S stock in the reorganization. Under section 354 
and paragraph (b)(2) of this section, P does not recognize gain. Under 
section 358 and paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, P's $100 excess 
loss account in T's stock decreases P's $150 basis in the S stock to 
$50. (Similarly, if S merges into T and P does not receive additional T 
stock, P's $150 basis in S's stock eliminates P's excess loss account in 
T's stock, and increases P's basis in T's stock to $50.)
    (d) Liquidation of only subsidiary. Assume instead that P and S are 
the only members of the P group, P has a $100 excess loss account in S's 
stock, and S liquidates in a transaction to which section 332 applies. 
Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the liquidation is not a 
deconsolidation event under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section merely 
because P is the only remaining member. Under section 332 and paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section, P does not recognize gain. Under section 334(b), 
P succeeds to S's basis in the assets it receives from S in the 
liquidation. (P would also not recognize gain if P transferred all of 
its assets (including S's stock) to S in a reorganization to which 
section 361(a) applied, because S would be a successor to P under 
paragraph (f) of this section.)
    Example 3. Section 355 distribution of stock with an excess loss 
account. (a) Facts. P has a $30 excess loss account in S's stock, and S 
has a $90 excess loss account in T's stock. S distributes the T stock to 
P in a transaction to which section 355 applies, and neither P nor S 
recognizes any gain or loss. At the time of the distribution, the T 
stock represents 33% of the value of the S stock. Following the 
distribution, P's basis in the S stock is allocated under Sec. 1.358-2 
in proportion to the fair market values of the S stock and the T stock.
    (b) Analysis. Under paragraph (c) of this section, S's distribution 
of the T stock is treated as a disposition. Under section 355(c) and 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section, S does not recognize any gain from the 
distribution. Under section 358, S's excess loss account in the T stock 
is eliminated, and P's $30 excess loss account in the S stock is treated 
as basis allocated between the S stock and the T stock based on their 
relative values. Consequently, P has a $20 excess loss account in the S 
stock and a $10 excess loss account in the T stock. (If P had a $30 
basis rather than a $30 excess loss account in the S stock, S would not 
recognize gain, its excess loss account in the T stock would be 
eliminated, and P's basis in the stock of S and T would be $20 and $10, 
respectively.)
    (c) Section 355 distribution to nonmember. The facts are the same as 
in paragraph (a) of this Example 3, except that P also distributes the T 
stock to its shareholders in a transaction to which section 355 applies. 
Under paragraph (c) of this section, P's distribution is treated as a 
disposition of T's stock. Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, 
because P's disposition is described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this 
section, P's $10 excess loss account in the T stock must be taken into 
account at the time of the distribution, notwithstanding the

    Example 4. Deconsolidation of a member. (a) Facts. P has a $50 
excess loss account in S's stock, and S has a $100 excess loss account 
in T's stock. T issues additional stock to a nonmember and, as a 
consequence, T becomes a nonmember.
    (b) Analysis. Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, S is treated 
as disposing of each of its shares of T's stock immediately before T 
becomes a nonmember. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, S takes 
into account its $100 excess loss account as gain from the sale or 
exchange of T's stock. Under Sec. 1.1502-32(b) of this section, S's 
$100 gain eliminates P's excess loss account in S's stock and increases 
P's basis in S's stock to $50.
    (c) Deconsolidation of a higher-tier member. The facts are the same 
as in paragraph (a) of this Example 4, except that S (rather than T) 
issues the stock and, as a consequence, both S and T become nonmembers. 
Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, P is treated as disposing of S's 
stock and S is treated as disposing of T's stock immediately before S 
and T become nonmembers. Under Sec. 1.1502-32(b) and paragraph (b)(3) 
of this section, because S and T become nonmembers in the same 
transaction and T is the lower-tier member, S is first treated under 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section as taking into account its $100 excess 
loss account as gain from the sale or exchange of T's stock. Under Sec. 
1.1502-32(b), S's $100 gain eliminates P's excess loss account in S's 
stock and increases P's basis in S's stock to $50 immediately before S 
becomes a nonmember. Thus, only S's $100 gain is taken into account in 
the determination of the group's consolidated taxable income.
    (d) Intercompany gain and deconsolidation. The facts are the same as 
in paragraph (c) of this Example 4, except that T has $30 of gain that 
is deferred under Sec. 1.1502-13 and taken into account in determining 
consolidated taxable income immediately before T becomes a nonmember. 
Under Sec. 1.1502-32(b), T's $30 gain decreases S's excess loss account 
in T's stock from $100 to $70 immediately before S is treated as 
disposing of T's stock. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, S is 
treated as taking into account its $70 excess loss account as gain from 
the disposition of T's stock. Under Sec. 1.1502-32(b), S's $70 gain 
from the excess loss account and T's $30 deferred gain that is taken 
into account eliminate P's $50 excess loss account in S's stock and 
increase P's basis in S's stock to $50 immediately before S becomes a 
nonmember.
    Example 5. Worthlessness. (a) Facts. P forms S with a $150 
contribution, and S borrows $150. For Year 1, S has a $50 ordinary loss 
that is carried over as part of the group's consolidated net operating 
loss. For Year 2, P has $160 of ordinary income, and S has a $160 
ordinary loss. Under Sec. 1.1502-32(b), S's loss results in P having a 
$10 excess loss account in S's stock. During Year 3, the value of S's 
assets (without taking S's liabilities into account) continues to 
decline and S's stock becomes worthless within the meaning of section 
165(g) (without taking into account Sec. 1.1502-80(c)). For Year 4, S 
has $10 of ordinary income.
    (b) Analysis. Under paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(A) of this section, P is 
not treated as disposing of S's stock in Year 3 solely because S's stock 
becomes worthless within the meaning of section 165(g) (taking S's 
liabilities into account). In addition, because S's stock is not treated 
as worthless, section 382(g)(4)(D) does not prevent the Year 1 
consolidated net operating loss carryover from offsetting S's $10 of 
income in Year 4.
    (c) Discharge of indebtedness. The facts are the same as in 
paragraph (a) of this Example 5, except that, instead of S's stock 
becoming worthless within the meaning of section 165(g), S's creditor 
discharges $40 of S's indebtedness during Year 3, S is insolvent by more 
than $40 before the discharge, the discharge is excluded from the P 
group's gross income under section 108(a), and $40 of the $50 
consolidated net operating loss carryover attributable to S is 
eliminated under section 108(b). Under Sec. 1.1502- 32(b)(3)(ii)(C), 
S's $40 of discharge income is treated as tax-exempt income because 
there is a corresponding decrease under Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(3)(iii) for 
elimination of the loss carryover. Under paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(B) of 
this section, P is treated as disposing of S's stock if the amount 
discharged is not included in gross income and is not treated as tax-
exempt income under Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(3)(ii)(C). Because the discharge 
is treated as tax-exempt income, P is not treated as disposing of S's 
stock by reason of the discharge.
    Example 6. Avoiding worthlessness. (a) Facts. P forms S with a $100 
contribution and S borrows $150. For Years 1 through 5, S has a $210 
ordinary loss that is absorbed by the group. Under Sec. 1.1502-32(b), 
S's loss results in P having a $110 excess loss account in S's stock. S 
defaults on the indebtedness, but the creditor does not discharge the 
debt (or initiate collection procedures). At the beginning of Year 6, S 
ceases any substantial operations with respect to the assets, but 
maintains their ownership with a principal purpose to avoid P's taking 
into account its excess loss account in S's stock.
    (b) Analysis. Under paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(A) of this section, P's 
excess loss account on each of its shares of S's stock ordinarily is 
taken into account at the time substantially all of S's assets are 
treated as disposed of, abandoned, or destroyed for Federal income tax 
purposes. Under paragraph (e) of this section, however, S's assets are 
not taken into account at the beginning of Year 6 for purposes of 
applying paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(A) of this section. Consequently, S is 
treated as worthless at the beginning of Year 6, and P's $110 excess 
loss account is taken into account.

    (h) Effective date--(1) Application. This section applies with 
respect to determinations of the basis of (including an excess loss 
account in) the stock of a member in consolidated return years beginning 
on or after January 1, 1995. If this section applies, basis (and excess 
loss accounts) must be determined or redetermined as if this section 
were in effect for all years (including, for example, the consolidated 
return years of another consolidated group to the extent adjustments 
during those consolidated return years are still reflected). Any such 
determination or redetermination does not, however, affect any prior 
period.
    (2) Dispositions of stock--(i) Dispositions of stock before 
effective date. If P was treated as disposing of stock of S in a tax 
year beginning before January 1, 1995 (including, for example, a deemed 
disposition because S was worthless) under the rules of this section 
then in effect, the amount of P's income, gain, deduction, or loss, and 
the stock basis reflected in that amount, are not redetermined under 
paragraph (h)(1) of this section. See paragraph (h)(3) of this section 
for the applicable rules.
    (ii) Application of special limitation. [Reserved]. For further 
guidance, see Sec. 1.1502-19T(h)(2)(ii).
    (iii) Intercompany amounts. For purposes of this paragraph (h)(2), a 
disposition does not include a transaction to which Sec. 1.1502-13, 
Sec. 1.1502-13T, Sec. 1.1502-14, or Sec. 1.1502-14T applies. Instead, 
the transaction is deemed to occur as the income, gain, deduction, or 
loss (if any) is taken into account.
    (3) Prior law. For prior determinations, see prior regulations under 
section 1502 as in effect with respect to the determination. See, e.g., 
Sec. 1.1502-19 as contained in the 26 CFR part 1 edition revised as of 
April 1, 1994.

Sec. 1.1502-19T  Excess loss accounts (temporary).

    (a) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1502-19(a).
    (b) Excess loss account taken into account as income or gain--(1) 
Operating rules--(i) General rule. Except as provided in paragraph 
(b)(1)(ii) of this section, if P is treated under Sec. 1.1502-19 as 
disposing of a share of S's stock, P takes into account its excess loss 
account in the share as income or gain from the disposition.
    (ii) Special limitation on amount taken into account. 
Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, if P is treated as 
disposing of a share of S's stock as a result of the application of 
Sec. 1.1502-19(c)(1)(iii)(B), the aggregate amount of its excess loss 
account in the shares of S's stock that P takes into account as income 
or gain from the disposition shall not exceed the amount of S's 
indebtedness that is discharged that is neither included in gross income 
nor treated as tax-exempt income under Sec. 1.1502-32T(b)(3)(ii)(C)(1). 
If more than one share of S's stock has an excess loss account, such 
excess loss accounts shall be taken into account pursuant to the 
preceding sentence, to the extent possible, in a manner that equalizes 
the excess loss accounts in S's shares that have an excess loss account.
    (iii) Treatment of disposition. Except as provided in Sec. 1.1502-
19(b)(4), the disposition is treated as a sale or exchange for purposes 
of determining the character of the income or gain.
    (b)(2) through (h)(2)(i) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see Sec. 
1.1502-19(b)(2) through (h)(2)(i).
    (h)(2)(ii) Application of special limitation. If P was treated as 
disposing of stock of S because S was treated as worthless as a result 
of the application of Sec. 1.1502-19(c)(1)(iii)(B) after August 29, 
2003 and in a consolidated return year beginning on or after January 1, 
1995, the amount of P's income, gain, deduction, or loss, and the stock 
basis reflected in that amount, are determined or redetermined with 
regard to paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. If P was treated as 
disposing of stock of S because S was treated as worthless as a result 
of the application of Sec. 1.1502-19(c)(1)(iii)(B) on or before August 
29, 2003 and in a consolidated return year beginning on or after January 
1, 1995, the group may determine or redetermine the amount of P's 
income, gain, deduction, or loss, and the stock basis reflected in that 
amount with regard to paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1502-20  Disposition or deconsolidation of subsidiary stock.

    (a) Loss disallowance--(1) General rule. No deduction is allowed for 
any loss recognized by a member with respect to the disposition of stock 
of a subsidiary. See also Sec. Sec. 1.1502-11(c) (stock losses 
attributable to certain pre-1966 distributions) and 1.1502-80(c) 
(deferring the treatment of stock of members as worthless under section 
165(g)).
    (2) Disposition. Disposition means any event in which gain or loss 
is recognized, in whole or in part.
    (3) Coordination with loss deferral and other disallowance rules--
(i) In general. Loss with respect to the stock of a subsidiary may be 
deferred or disallowed under other applicable provisions of the Code and 
regulations, including section 267(f). Paragraph (a)(1) of this section 
does not apply to loss that is disallowed under any other provision. If 
loss is deferred under any other provision, paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section applies when the loss is taken into account. However, if an 
overriding event described in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section 
occurs before the deferred loss is taken into account, paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section applies to the loss immediately before the event occurs 
even though the loss may not be taken into account until a later time. 
Any loss not disallowed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section is 
subject to disallowance or deferral under other applicable provisions of 
the Code and regulations.
    (ii) Overriding events. For purposes of paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this 
section, the following are overriding events:
    (A) The stock ceases to be owned by a member of the consolidated 
group.
    (B) The stock is canceled or redeemed (regardless of whether it is 
retired or held as treasury stock).
    (C) The stock is treated as disposed of under Sec. 1.1502-
19(c)(1)(ii)(B) or (c)(1)(iii).
    (4) Netting. Paragraph (a) (1) of this section does not apply to 
loss with respect to the disposition of stock of a subsidiary, to the 
extent that, as a consequence of the same plan or arrangement, gain is 
taken into account by members with respect to stock of the same 
subsidiary having the same material terms. If the gain to which this 
paragraph (a)(4) applies is less than the amount of the loss with 
respect to the disposition of the subsidiary's stock, the gain is 
applied to offset loss with respect to each share disposed of as a 
consequence of the same plan or arrangement in proportion to the amount 
of the loss deduction that would have been disallowed under paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section with respect to such share before the application 
of this paragraph (a)(4). If the same item of gain could be taken into 
account more than once in limiting the application of paragraphs (a)(1) 
and (b)(1) of this section, the item is taken into account only once.
    (5) Examples. For purposes of the examples in this section, unless 
otherwise stated, all corporations have only one class of stock 
outstanding, all groups file consolidated returns on a calendar-year 
basis, the facts set forth the only corporate activity, all transactions 
are between unrelated persons, and tax liabilities are disregarded. The 
basis of each asset is the same for determining earnings and profits 
adjustments and taxable income. References to the investment adjustment 
system are references to the rules of Sec. Sec. 1.1502-19, 1.1502-32 
and 1.1502-33. The principles of this paragraph (a) are illustrated by 
the following examples.

    Example 1. Loss attributable to recognized built-it gain. P buys all 
the stock of T for $100, and T becomes a member of the P group. T has an 
asset with a basis of $0 and a value of $100. T sells the asset for 
$100. Under the investment adjustment system, P's basis in the T stock 
increases to $200. Five years later, P sells all the T stock for $100 
and recognizes a loss of $100. Under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, 
no deduction is allowed to P for the $100 loss.
    Example 2. Effect of post-acquisition appreciation. P buys all the 
stock of T for $100, and T becomes a member of the P group. T has an 
asset with a basis of $0 and a value of $100. T sells the asset for 
$100. Under the investment adjustment system, P's basis in the T stock 
increases to $200. T reinvests the proceeds of the sale in an asset that 
appreciates in value to $180. Five years after the sale, P sells all the 
stock of T for $180 and recognizes a $20 loss. Under paragraph (a)(1) of

[[Page 327]]

this section, no deduction is allowed to P for the $20 loss.
    Example 3. Disallowance of duplicated loss. P forms S with a 
contribution of $100 in exchange for all of the S stock, and S becomes a 
member of the P group. S has an operating loss of $60. The group is 
unable to use the loss, and the loss becomes a consolidated net 
operating loss carryover attributable to S. Five years later, P sells 
the stock of S for $40, recognizing a $60 loss. Under paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section, P's $60 loss on the sale of the S stock is disallowed. 
(See paragraph (g) of this section for the elective reattribution of S's 
$60 net operating loss to P in connection with the sale.)
    Example 4. Deemed asset sale election. (i) P forms S with a 
contribution of $100 in exchange for all of the S stock, and S becomes a 
member of the P group. S buys an asset for $100, and the value of the 
asset declines to $40. P sells all the S stock to P1 for $40. Under 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section, P's $60 loss on the sale of the S 
stock is disallowed.
    (ii) If P and P1 instead elect deemed asset sale treatment under 
section 338 (h) (10), S is treated as selling all of its assets, and no 
loss is recognized by P on its sale of the S stock. As a result of the 
recharacterization of the stock sale as an asset sale, the $60 loss in 
the asset is recognized. Under section 338 (h)(10), S's $60 loss is 
included in the consolidated return of the P group, and S is treated as 
liquidating into P under section 332 following the deemed asset sale. 
Paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not apply to S's $60 loss.
    Example 5. Gain and loss recognized with respect to stock as a 
consequence of the same plan or arrangement. P, the common parent of a 
group, owns 50 shares of the stock of T with an aggregate basis of $50, 
and S, a wholly owned subsidiary of P, owns the remaining 50 shares of 
T's stock with an aggregate basis of $100. All of the stock has the same 
terms. P and S sell all the T stock to the public for $140 pursuant to a 
single public offering. P therefore recognizes a gain of $20 and S 
recognizes a loss of $30. For purposes of paragraph (a)(4) of this 
section, the gain and loss recognized by P and S is considered to be a 
consequence of the same plan or arrangement. Accordingly, the amount of 
S's $30 loss disallowed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section is 
limited to $10 (the $30 reduced by P's $20 gain).
    Example 6. Deferred loss and recognized gain. (i) P is the common 
parent of a consolidated group, S is a wholly owned subsidiary of P, and 
T is a recently purchased, wholly owned subsidiary of S. S has a $100 
basis in the T stock, and T has an asset with a basis of $40 and a value 
of $100. T sells the asset for $100, recognizing a $60 gain. Under the 
investment adjustment system, S's basis in the T stock increases from 
$100 to $160. S sells its T stock to P for $100 in an intercompany 
transaction, recognizing a $60 intercompany loss that is deferred under 
section 267(f) and Sec. 1.1502-13. P subsequently sells all the stock 
of T for $100 to X, a member of the same controlled group (as defined in 
section 267(f)) as P but not a member of the P consolidated group.
    (ii) Under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, the application of 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section to S's $60 intercompany loss on the 
sale of its T stock to P is deferred, because S's intercompany loss is 
deferred under section 267(f) and Sec. 1.1502-13. P's sale of the T 
stock to X ordinarily would result in S's intercompany loss being taken 
into account under the matching rule of Sec. 1.1502-13(c). The deferred 
loss is not taken into account under Sec. 1.267(f)-1, however, because 
P's sale to X (a member of the same controlled group as P) is a second 
intercompany transaction for purposes of section 267(f). Nevertheless, 
paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section provides that paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section applies to the intercompany loss as a result of P's sale to 
X because the T stock ceases to be owned by a member of the P 
consolidated group. Thus, the loss is disallowed under paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section immediately before P's sale and is therefore never taken 
into account under section 267(f).
    (iii) The facts are the same as in (i) of this Example, except that 
S is liquidated after its sale of the T stock to P, but before P's sale 
of the T stock to X, and P sells the T stock to X for $110. Under 
Sec. Sec. 1.1502-13(j) and 1.267(f)-1(b), P succeeds to S's 
intercompany loss as a result of S's liquidation. Thus, paragraph 
(a)(3)(i) of this section continues to defer the application of 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section until P's sale to X. Under paragraph 
(a)(4) of this section, the amount of S's $60 intercompany loss 
disallowed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section is limited to $50 
because P's $10 gain on the disposition of the T stock is taken into 
account as a consequence of the same plan or arrangement.
    (iv) The facts are the same as in (i) of this Example, except that P 
sells the T stock to A, a person related to P within the meaning of 
section 267(b)(2). Although S's intercompany loss is ordinarily taken 
into account under the matching rule of Sec. 1.1502-13(c) as a result 
of P's sale, Sec. 1.267(f)-1(c)(2)(ii) provides that none of the 
intercompany loss is taken into account because A is a nonmember that is 
related to P under section 267(b). Under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this 
section, paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not apply to loss that is 
disallowed under any other provision. Because Sec. 1.267(f)-1(c)(2)(ii) 
and section 267(d) provide that the benefit of the intercompany loss is 
retained by A if the property is later disposed of at a gain, the 
intercompany loss is not disallowed for purposes of paragraph (a)(3)(i) 
of this section. Thus, the intercompany loss is disallowed under 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section immediately before P's sale and is 
therefore never taken into account under section 267(d).


[[Page 328]]


    (b) Basis reduction on deconsolidation--(1) General rule. If a 
member's basis in a share of stock of a subsidiary exceeds its value 
immediately before a deconsolidation of the share, the basis of the 
share is reduced at that time to an amount equal to its value. If both a 
disposition and a deconsolidation occur with respect to a share in the 
same transaction, paragraph (a) of this section applies and, to the 
extent necessary to effectuate the purposes of this section, this 
paragraph (b) applies following the application of paragraph (a) of this 
section.
    (2) Deconsolidation. Deconsolidation means any event that causes a 
share of stock of a subsidiary that remains outstanding to be no longer 
owned by a member of any consolidated group of which the subsidiary is 
also a member.
    (3) Value. Value means fair market value.
    (4) Netting. Paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not apply to 
reduce the basis of stock of a subsidiary, to the extent that, as a 
consequence of the same plan or arrangement as that giving rise to the 
deconsolidation, gain is taken into account by members with respect to 
stock of the same subsidiary having the same material terms. If the gain 
to which this paragraph (b)(4) applies is less than the amount of basis 
reduction with respect to shares of the subsidiary's stock, the gain is 
applied to offset basis reduction with respect to each share 
deconsolidated as a consequence of the same plan or arrangement in 
proportion to the amount of the reduction that would have been required 
under paragraph (b)(1) of this section with respect to such share before 
the application of this paragraph (b)(4). If the same item of gain could 
be taken into account more than once in limiting the application of 
paragraphs (a)(1) and (b)(1) of this section, the time is taken into 
account only once.
    (5) Loss within 2 years after basis reduction--(i) In general. If a 
share is deconsolidated and a direct or indirect disposition of the 
share occurs within 2 years after the date of the deconsolidation, a 
separate statement entitled ``Statement Pursuant to Section Sec. 
1.1502-20(b)(5)'' must be filed with the taxpayer's return for the year 
of disposition. If the taxpayer fails to file the statement as required, 
no deduction is allowed for any loss recognized with respect to the 
disposition. A disposition after the 2-year period described in this 
paragraph (b)(5) that is pursuant to an agreement, option, or other 
arrangement entered into within the 2-year period is treated as a 
disposition within the 2-year period for purposes of this section.
    (ii) Contents of statement. The statement required under paragraph 
(b)(5)(i) of this section must contain--
    (A) The name and employer identification number (E.I.N.) of the 
subsidiary.
    (B) The amount of prior basis reduction (if any) with respect to the 
stock of the subsidiary under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (C) The basis of the stock of the subsidiary immediately before the 
disposition.
    (D) The amount realized on the disposition.
    (E) The amount of the loss recognized on the disposition.
    (6) Examples. The principles of this paragraph (b) are illustrated 
by the following examples.

    Example 1. Simultaneous application of loss disallowance rule and 
basis reduction rule to stock of the same subsidiary. (i) P buys all the 
stock of T for $100, and T becomes a member of the P group. T has an 
asset with a basis of $0 and a value of $100. T sells the asset for 
$100. Under the investment adjustment system, P's basis in the T stock 
increases to $200. Five years later, P sells 60 shares of T stock for 
$60 and recognizes $60 loss on the sale. The sale causes a 
deconsolidation of the remaining 40 shares of T stock held by P.
    (ii) P's $60 loss on the sale of T stock is disallowed under 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section, P must reduce the basis of the 40 shares of T stock it 
continues to own from $80 to $40, the value of the shares immediately 
before the deconsolidation.
    (iii) Although P's disposition of the 60 shares also causes a 
deconsolidation of these shares, paragraph (b)(1) of this section 
provides that, if both paragraph (a) and paragraph (b) of this section 
apply to a share in the same transaction, paragraph (a) of this section 
applies first and this paragraph (b) applies only to the extent 
necessary to effectuate the purposes of this section. Under paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section, P's $60 loss on the sale of the 60 shares is 
disallowed. Under the facts of this example, it is not necessary to also 
apply this paragraph (b) to the

[[Page 329]]

60 shares in order to effectuate the purposes of this section.
    Example 2. Deconsolidation of subsidiary stock on contribution to a 
partnership. (i) P buys all the stock of T for $100, and T becomes a 
member of the P group. T has an asset with a basis of $0 and a value of 
$100. T sells the asset for $100. Under the investment adjustment 
system, P's basis in the T stock increases to $200. Five years later, P 
transfers all the stock of T to partnership M in exchange for a 
partnership interest in M, in a transaction to which section 721 
applies.
    (ii) At the time of the exchange, P's basis in the T stock is $200 
and the T stock's value is $100. Under paragraph (b) of this section, 
the transfer to M causes a deconsolidation of the T stock, and P must 
reduce its basis in the T stock, immediately before the transfer to M, 
from $200 to the stock's $100 value at the time of the transfer. As a 
result, P has a basis of $100 in its interest in M, and M has a basis of 
$100 in the stock of T.
    Example 3. Simultaneous application of loss disallowance and basis 
reduction to stock of different subsidiaries. (i) P owns all the stock 
of S, which in turn owns all the stock of S1, and S and S1 are members 
of the P group. P's basis in the S stock is $100 and S's basis in the S1 
stock is $100. S1 buys all the stock of T for $100, and T becomes a 
member of the P group. T has an asset with a basis of $0 and a value of 
$100. T sells the asset for $100. Under the investment adjustment 
system, S1's basis in the T stock, S's basis in the S1 stock, and P's 
basis in the S stock each increase from $100 to $200. S then sells all 
the S1 stock for $100 and recognizes a loss of $100.
    (ii) Under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, S's $100 loss on the 
sale of the S1 stock is disallowed.
    (iii) If S1 and T are not members of a consolidated group 
immediately after the sale of the stock of S1, the T stock is 
deconsolidated and, under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, S1 must 
reduce the basis of the T stock to its $100 value immediately before the 
sale.
    (iv) If S1 and T are members of a consolidated group immediately 
after the sale of the S1 stock, the T stock is not deconsolidated, and 
no reduction is required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    Example 4. Extending the time period for dispositions. (i) In Year 
1, P, the common parent of a group, buys all 100 shares of the stock of 
T for $100. T's only asset has a basis of $0 and a value of $100. T 
sells the asset for $100. Under the investment adjustment system, P's 
basis in the T stock increases from $100 to $200. At the beginning of 
Year 5, P causes T to issue 30 additional shares of stock to the public 
for $30. This issuance causes a deconsolidation of the T stock owned by 
P, and paragraph (b)(1) of this section requires P to reduce its basis 
in the T stock from $200 to $100.
    (ii) Within 2 years after the date of the basis reduction, P agrees 
to sell all of its T stock for $90 at the end of Year 7. Under paragraph 
(b)(5) of this section, P's disposition of the T stock at the end of 
Year 7 is treated as occurring within the 2-year period following the 
basis reduction, because the disposition is pursuant to an agreement 
reached within 2 years after the basis reduction. Accordingly, P's $10 
loss may not be deducted unless P files the statement required under 
paragraph (b)(5) of this section. This result is reached whether or not 
the agreement is in writing. P's disposition would also have been 
treated as occurring within the 2-year period if the disposition were 
pursuant to an option issued within the period.
    Example 5. Deferred loss and subsequent basis reduction. (i) P is 
the common parent of a consolidated group, S is a wholly owned 
subsidiary of P, and T is a recently purchased, wholly owned subsidiary 
of S. S has a $100 basis in the T stock, and T has an asset with a basis 
of $40 and a value of $100. T sells the asset for $100, recognizing $60 
of gain. Under the investment adjustment system, S's basis in the T 
stock increases from $100 to $160. S sells its T stock to P for $100 in 
an intercompany transaction, recognizing a $60 intercompany loss that is 
deferred under section 267(f) and Sec. 1.1502-13. T issues 30 
additional shares of stock to the public for $30 which causes a 
deconsolidation of the T stock owned by P.
    (ii) Under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, the application of 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section to S's intercompany loss on the sale of 
its T stock to P is deferred because S's loss is deferred under section 
267(f) and Sec. 1.1502-13. Because the fair market value of the T stock 
owned by P is $100 immediately before the deconsolidation and P has a 
$100 basis in the stock at that time, no basis reduction is required 
under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (iii) T's issuance of additional shares to the public results in S's 
intercompany loss being taken into account under the acceleration rule 
of Sec. 1.1502-13(d) because there is no difference between P's $100 
basis in the T stock and the $100 basis the T stock would have had if P 
and S had been divisions of a single corporation. S's loss taken into 
account is disallowed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    Example 6. Gain and basis reduction with respect to the same plan or 
arrangement. (i) P, the common parent of a group, owns 50 shares of T 
stock with an aggregate basis of $50, and S, a wholly owned subsidiary 
of P, owns the remaining 50 shares of T stock with an aggregate basis of 
$100. All of the stock has the same terms. P sells all of its T stock to 
the public for $70 and recognizes a $20 gain. The sale causes a 
deconsolidation of S's 50 shares of T stock.

[[Page 330]]

    (ii) Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, S must reduce the basis 
of its 50 shares of T stock from $100 to $70, the value of the shares 
immediately before the deconsolidation. However, under paragraph (b)(4) 
of this section, because P's $20 gain is recognized as a consequence of 
the same plan or arrangement as that giving rise to the deconsolidation, 
S's basis reduction is eliminated to the extent of $20. Thus, S must 
reduce the basis of its T stock from $100 to $90.
    Example 7. Netting allocated between loss disallowance and basis 
reduction. (i) P is the common parent of a group and S is its wholly 
owned subsidiary. P and S each own 50 shares of T stock and each has an 
aggregate basis of $50. All of the stock has the same terms. S recently 
purchased its T stock from S1, a lower tier subsidiary, in an 
intercompany transaction in which S1 recognized a $30 intercompany gain 
that was deferred under Sec. 1.1502-13. T has an asset with a basis of 
$0 and a value of $100. T sells the asset for $100, recognizing $100 of 
gain. Under the investment adjustment system, P and S each increase the 
basis of their T stock to $100. S sells all of its T stock to the public 
for $50 and recognizes a $50 loss. The sale causes a deconsolidation of 
P's T stock.
    (ii) S's $50 loss on the sale of T stock is disallowed under 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section, P must reduce its $100 basis in the T stock to the $50 value 
immediately before the deconsolidation.
    (iii) Under the matching rule of Sec. 1.1502-13, S's sale of its T 
stock results in S1's $30 intercompany gain being taken into account. 
Under paragraphs (a)(4) and (b)(4) of this section, the gain may be 
taken into account by P and S in limiting the application of paragraphs 
(a)(1) and (b)(1) of this section, but it may be taken into account only 
once. Under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, S may apply the gain to 
decrease the amount of loss disallowed under paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section from $50 to $20. None of the gain remains to decrease the $50 of 
P's basis reduction under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. (P may 
instead apply the gain to decrease the basis reduction under paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section instead of S decreasing its disallowed loss, but 
if the T stock is sold within 2 years, the statement described in 
paragraph (b)(5) of this section must be filed if a deduction is to be 
allowed for any loss recognized on the disposition.)

    (c) Allowable loss--(1) General rule. The amount of loss disallowed 
under paragraph (a)(1) of this section and the amount of basis reduction 
under paragraph (b)(1) of this section with respect to a share of stock 
shall not exceed the sum of the following amounts--
    (i) Extraordinary gain dispositions. The amount of income or gain 
(or its equivalent), net of directly related expenses, that is allocated 
to the share from extraordinary gain dispositions.
    (ii) Positive investment adjustments. The amount of the positive 
adjustment (if any) with respect to the share under Sec. 1.1502-32 for 
each consolidated return year, but only to the extent the amount exceeds 
the amount described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section for the 
year.
    (iii) Duplicated loss. The amount of duplicated loss with respect to 
the share.
    (2) Operating rules. For purposes of applying paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section--
    (i) Extraordinary gain dispositions. An ``extraordinary gain 
disposition'' is--
    (A) An actual or deemed disposition of--
    (1) A capital asset as defined in section 1221 (determined without 
the application of any other rules of law).
    (2) Property used in a trade or business as defined in section 
1231(b) (determined without the application of any holding period 
requirement).
    (3) An asset described in section 1221 (1), (3), (4), or (5), if 
substantially all the assets in such category from the same trade or 
business are disposed of in one transaction (or series of related 
transactions).
    (4) Assets disposed of in an applicable asset acquisition under 
section 1060(c).
    (B) A positive section 481(a) adjustment.
    (C) A discharge of indebtedness.
    (D) Any other event (or item) identified in guidance published in 
the Internal Revenue Bulletin.


An extraordinary gain disposition is taken into account under paragraph 
(c)(1)(i) of this section only if it occurs on or after November 19, 
1990. For this purpose, federal income taxes may be directly related to 
extraordinary gain dispositions only to the extent of the excess (if 
any) of the group's income tax liability actually imposed under subtitle 
A of the Internal Revenue Code for the taxable year of the extraordinary 
gain dispositions over the group's income tax liability for the taxable 
year redetermined by not taking into account the extraordinary

[[Page 331]]

gain dispositions. For this purpose, the group's income tax liability 
actually imposed and its redetermined income tax liability are 
determined without taking into account the foreign tax credit under 
section 27(a) of the Code.
    (ii) Positive investment adjustments. For purposes of paragraph 
(c)(1)(ii) of this section, a positive adjustment under Sec. 1.1502-32 
is the sum of the amounts under Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(2) (i) through (iii) 
for the consolidated return year (the adjustment determined without 
taking distributions into account). However, amounts included in any 
loss carryover are taken into account in the year they arise rather than 
the year absorbed.
    (iii) Applicable amounts. Amounts are described in paragraphs 
(c)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section only to the extent they are reflected 
in the basis of the share, directly or indirectly, immediately before 
the disposition or deconsolidation. For this purpose, an amount is 
reflected in the basis of a share if the share's basis would have been 
different without the amount. However, amounts included in any loss 
carryover are taken into account in the year they arise rather than the 
year absorbed.
    (iv) Related party rule. The amounts described in paragraphs (c)(1) 
(i) and (ii) of this section are not reduced or eliminated by reason of 
an acquisition of the share from a person related within the meaning of 
section 267(b) or section 707(b)(1), substituting ``10 percent'' for 
``50 percent'' each place that it appears, even if the share is not 
transferred basis property as defined in section 7701 (a)(43).
    (v) Pre-September 13, 1991 positive investment adjustments--(A) In 
general. The amount determined under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this 
section is limited for tax years of the subsidiary ending on or before 
September 13, 1991. The amount may not exceed the net increase, if any, 
in the basis of the share from--
    (1) The date the share was first acquired by a member (whether or 
not a member at that time); to
    (2) The end of the last taxable year ending on or before September 
13, 1991 (or, if earlier, the date of the disposition or 
deconsolidation). If the share is transferred basis property (within the 
meaning of section 7701 (a)(43) from a prior consolidated group, the 
date under paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A)(1) of this section is the date the 
share was first acquired by a member of the prior group. For purposes of 
this paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A), an increase in an excess loss account is 
treated as a decrease in stock basis and a decrease in an excess loss 
account is treated as an increase in stock basis.
    (B) Cessation of netting. If a lower amount would result under 
paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section by determining the amount under 
this paragraph (c)(2)(v) as of the end of an earlier taxable year ending 
after December 31, 1986--
    (1) The amount under this paragraph (c)(2)(v) is determined as of 
the earlier year end; and
    (2) The amount determined under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section 
is not limited for tax years of the subsidiary ending after the earlier 
year end.
    (vi) Duplicated loss. ``Duplicated loss'' is determined immediately 
after a disposition or deconsolidation, and equals the excess (if any) 
of--
    (A) The sum of--
    (1) The aggregate adjusted basis of the assets of the subsidiary 
other than any stock and securities that the subsidiary owns in another 
subsidiary, and
    (2) Any losses attributable to the subsidiary and carried to the 
subsidiary's first taxable year following the disposition or 
deconsolidation, and
    (3) Any deferred deductions (such as deductions deferred under 
section 469) of the subsidiary, over
    (B) The sum of--
    (1) The value of the subsidiary's stock, and
    (2) Any liabilities of the subsidiary, and
    (3) Any other relevant items.
    The amounts determined under this paragraph (c)(2)(vi) with respect 
to a subsidiary include its allocable share of corresponding amounts 
with respect to all lower tier subsidiaries. If 80 percent or more in 
value of the stock of a subsidiary is acquired by purchase in a single 
transaction (or in a series of related transactions during any 12-month 
period), the value of the subsidiary's stock may not exceed the purchase

[[Page 332]]

price of the stock divided by the percentage of the stock (by value) so 
purchased. For this purpose, stock is acquired by purchase if the 
transferee is not related to the transferor within the meaning of 
sections 267(b) and 707(b)(1), substituting ``10 percent'' for ``50 
percent'' each place that it appears, and the transferee's basis in the 
stock is determined wholly by reference to the consideration paid for 
such stock.
    (vii) Disallowance amounts applied only once. The amounts described 
in paragraph (c)(1) of this section are not applied more than once to 
disallow a loss, reduce basis, or reattribute loss under this section.
    (3) Statement of allowed loss. Paragraph (c)(1) of this section 
applies only if the separate statement required under this paragraph 
(c)(3) is filed with the taxpayer's return for the year of the 
disposition or deconsolidation. The statement must be entitled ``ALLOWED 
LOSS UNDER SECTION 1.1502-20(c)'' and must contain--
    (i) The name and employer identification number (E.I.N.) of the 
subsidiary.
    (ii) The basis of the stock of the subsidiary immediately before the 
disposition or deconsolidation.
    (iii) The amount realized on the disposition and the amount of fair 
market value on the deconsolidation.
    (iv) The amount of the deduction not disallowed under paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section by reason of this paragraph (c) and the amount of 
basis not reduced under paragraph (b)(1) of this section by reason of 
this paragraph (c).
    (v) The amount of loss disallowed under paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section and the amount of basis reduced under paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section.
    (4) Examples. For purposes of the examples in this paragraph, unless 
otherwise stated, the group files the statement required under paragraph 
(c)(3) of this section. The principles of this paragraph (c) are 
illustrated by the following examples.

    Example 1. Allowable loss attributable to lost built-in gain. (i) 
Individual A forms T. P buys all the stock of T from A for $100, and T 
becomes a member of the P group. T has a capital asset with a basis of 
$0 and a value of $100. The value of the asset declines, and T sells the 
asset for $40. Under the investment adjustment system, P's basis in the 
T stock increases to $140. P then sells all the stock of T for $40 and 
recognizes a loss of $100.
    (ii) The amount of the $100 loss disallowed under paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section may not exceed the amount determined under paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section. Under paragraphs (c)(2) (i) and (iii) of this 
section, T's $40 gain is from an extraordinary gain disposition and the 
amount is reflected in the basis of the T stock under Sec. 1.1502-32 
immediately before the disposition. Thus, the gain is described in 
paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. Because this amount is the only 
amount described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the amount of P's 
$100 loss that is disallowed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section is 
limited to $40. (No amount is described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this 
section because the amount of T's positive investment adjustments does 
not exceed the amount included under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this 
section.)
    (iii) The results would be the same if the asset, instead of being 
owned by T, is owned by a partnership in which T is a partner and T is 
allocated the $40 of gain under section 704(b). Under paragraphs (c)(2) 
(i) and (iii) of this section, T's $40 gain is from an extraordinary 
gain disposition, and the gain is reflected in the basis of the T stock 
under Sec. 1.1502-32 immediately before the disposition.
    Example 2. Extraordinary gain dispositions. (i) Individual A forms 
T. P buys all the stock of T from A for $100 in Year 1, and T becomes a 
member of the P group. T owns a capital asset, asset 1, with a basis of 
$0 and a value of $100. T sells asset 1 for $100 in Year 1 and invests 
the proceeds in a trade or business asset, asset 2. For Year 2, asset 2 
produces $30 of gross operating income and $20 of cost recovery 
deductions. On December 31 of Year 2, asset 2 has an $80 adjusted basis 
and T disposes of asset 2 for $85; however, because T incurs $20 of 
expenses directly related to the sale of asset 2, the disposition 
produces a $15 loss that is taken into account in the determination of 
taxable income or loss under Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(2)(i) (the loss offsets 
T's $10 of operating income for Year 2, as well as $5 of operating 
income of P in that year). Under the investment adjustment system, P's 
basis in the T stock increases by $95, to $195, because T has $110 of 
income and a $15 loss. P sells the T stock for $95 in Year 5 and 
recognizes a $100 loss.
    (ii) Under paragraphs (c)(2) (i) and (iii) of this section, the $100 
gain from the disposition of asset 1 is from an extraordinary gain 
disposition and is reflected in the basis of the T stock. Thus, the gain 
is described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. The sale of asset 2 
is not taken into account under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section 
because, net of directly related expenses, T does not have income or 
gain from the sale. (No amount is described under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) 
of this

[[Page 333]]

section because T's positive investment adjustments are taken into 
account under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.) Because the $100 
amount described under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section equals P's 
$100 loss from the disposition of the T stock, all of the loss is 
disallowed.
    Example 3. Positive investment adjustments. (i) Individual A forms 
T. S, a member of the P group, buys all the stock of T from A for $100, 
and T becomes a member of the P group. T has an asset with a basis of $0 
and a value of $100. The asset earns $100 of operating income in Year 1 
and declines in value to $0. T invests the operating income in another 
asset that produces a $25 operating loss for Year 2. Under the 
investment adjustment system, S's basis in the T stock increases to $200 
at the end of Year 1, and decreases to $175 at the end of Year 2. S 
sells all the stock of T for $75 in Year 5 and recognizes a loss of 
$100.
    (ii) Under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the $100 of income 
from Year 1 is a positive investment adjustment. The amount is not 
reduced by the $25 operating loss for Year 2. Because the $100 amount 
described under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section equals S's $100 
loss from the disposition of the T stock, all of the loss is disallowed.
    Example 4. Treatment of net operating income as attributable to 
built-in gain. (i) Individual A forms T. P buys all the stock of T from 
A for $100, and T becomes a member of the P group. T has a capital asset 
with a basis of $0 and a value of $100. The asset declines in value to 
$40. The asset earns $100 of operating income unrelated to its $60 
decline in value. Under the investment adjustment system, P's basis in 
the T stock increases to $200. P then sells all the stock of T for $140 
(the asset worth $40 and $100 cash) and recognizes a loss of $60.
    (ii) The $100 adjustment to the basis of the T stock is an amount 
described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. Because this amount 
exceeds the amount of loss otherwise disallowed under paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section, P's entire $60 loss from the disposition of T stock is 
disallowed.
    Example 5. Carryover basis transactions--amounts attributable to 
separate return years. (i) Individual A forms T. S purchases all the 
stock of T from A for $100, and T becomes a member of the S group. T has 
a capital asset with a basis of $0 and a value of $100. T sells the 
asset for $100. Under the investment adjustment system, S's basis in the 
T stock increases to $200. P buys all of the stock of S for $100, and 
both S and T become members of the P group. S then sells the T stock for 
$100 and recognizes a loss of $100.
    (ii) Under paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section, the $100 
adjustment to S's basis in the T stock while a member of the S group is 
an amount described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section with respect 
to the P group because it continues to be reflected in the basis of the 
T stock immediately before the stock is disposed of. Because this amount 
equals the loss otherwise disallowed under paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section, S's $100 loss from the disposition of T stock is disallowed.
    Example 6. Cost basis for subsidiary stock. (i) In Year 1, 
individual A forms T. T's assets appreciate in value from $0 to $100, 
and T recognizes $100 of gain in an extraordinary gain disposition. T 
reinvests the sale proceeds in assets that appreciate in value to $150. 
In Year 3, A sells all of the T stock to P for $150, and T becomes a 
member of the P group. While a member of the P group, T's assets decline 
in value to $130 and P sells the T stock in Year 7 for $130 and 
recognizes a $20 loss.
    (ii) Although T has a $100 gain from extraordinary gain 
dispositions, the gain is not reflected in P's basis in the T stock 
within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section. P's basis 
reflects the stock's value at the time of P's purchase, and is 
determined without regard to whether T recognized the gain before the 
purchase. Thus, no part of T's gain is described in paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section, and no part of the $20 loss is disallowed under paragraph 
(a) of this section. (For rules that apply if A and P are related 
persons, see paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section.)
    Example 7. Adjustments to stock basis under applicable rules of law. 
(i) Individual A forms T, and T's assets subsequently appreciate. T 
borrows $100 on a nonrecourse basis secured by the appreciated assets. P 
buys all of the stock of T from A for $150. After becoming a member of 
the P group, T has a $100 operating loss that is absorbed in the 
determination of consolidated taxable income and P's basis in the T 
stock is reduced to $50 under Sec. 1.1502-32. Because T's assets have 
declined in value, T's creditors discharge $60 of T's indebtedness. The 
$60 discharge is not included in T's gross income under section 108(a), 
but no attributes are reduced under section 108(b).
    (ii) Under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, the discharge of 
indebtedness is an extraordinary gain disposition. Under Sec. 1.1502-
32(b)(3)(ii), however, the $60 discharge of indebtedness is not treated 
as tax-exempt income that increases P's basis in the T stock. 
Consequently, under paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section, T's discharge 
of indebtedness income is not reflected in P's basis in the T stock. 
Thus, there is no amount under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (iii) The facts are the same as in paragraph (i) of this Example, 
except that $60 of T's operating loss is not absorbed and is included in 
a consolidated net operating loss that is carried over under Sec. Sec. 
1.1502-21A or 1.1502-21, and the $60 is eliminated from the carryover 
under section 108(b) as a result of T's discharge of indebtedness. The 
absorption of $40

[[Page 334]]

of T's loss reduces P's basis in the T stock from $150 to $110. The $60 
discharge of indebtedness is treated as tax-exempt income that increases 
P's basis in the T stock, and the $60 attribute reduction is treated as 
a noncapital, nondeductible expense that reduces P's basis in the T 
stock. Thus, P's basis in T's stock remains $110 following the discharge 
and attribute reduction. Because P's basis is $110, rather than $50, the 
discharge of indebtedness income is reflected in P's basis for purposes 
of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section. Thus, the amount under 
paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section is $60.
    Example 8. Duplicated loss. (i) Individual A forms T with a 
contribution of $100 in exchange for all of the T stock. Individual B 
forms T1 with a contribution of land that has a $90 basis and $100 
value. T buys all the stock of T1 from B for $100. P buys all the stock 
of T from A for $100, and both T and T1 become members of the P group. 
The value of T1's land declines to $40. P sells all of the T stock for 
$40 and recognizes a loss of $60.
    (ii) Under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, P's amount of 
duplicated loss is $50. This is computed under paragraph (c)(2)(vi) of 
this section immediately after the disposition as the excess of--
    (A) The $90 aggregate adjusted basis of the assets of T and T1 
(other than stock and securities of T1 owned by T), over
    (B) The $40 fair market value of the T stock (determined under 
paragraph (c)(2)(vi) of this section). Because this amount is the only 
amount described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the amount of P's 
$60 loss disallowed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section is limited to 
$50.
    (iii) The result would be the same if the value of T1's property did 
not decline and T1 instead had an operating loss of $60 (attributable to 
borrowed funds) which the P group was unable to use. In that case, the 
$50 excess of the sum of--
    (A) The $90 aggregate adjusted basis of the assets of T and T1 
(other than stock and securities of members of the P group), plus the 
$60 net operating loss attributable to T1 and carried to its first 
taxable year following the disposition, over
    (B) The sum of the $40 fair market value of the T stock, plus the 
$60 of T1 liabilities, is an amount described in paragraph (c)(2)(vi) of 
this section. (See paragraph (g) of this section for the elective 
reattribution of T1's $60 net operating loss to P in connection with the 
sale.)
    Example 9. Intercompany stock sales. (i) P is the common parent of a 
consolidated group, S is a wholly owned subsidiary of P, and T is a 
wholly owned recently purchased subsidiary of S. S has a $100 basis in 
the T stock, and T has a capital asset with a basis of $0 and a value of 
$100. T's asset declines in value to $60. Before T has any positive 
investment adjustments or extraordinary gain dispositions, S sells its T 
stock to P for $60. T's asset reappreciates and is sold for $100, and T 
recognizes $100 of gain. Under the investment adjustment system, P's 
basis in the T stock increases to $160. P then sells all of the T stock 
for $100 and recognizes a loss of $60.
    (ii) S's sale of the T stock to P is an intercompany transaction. 
Thus, S's $40 loss is deferred under section 267(f) and Sec. 1.1502-13. 
Under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the application of paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section to S's $40 loss is deferred until the loss is 
taken into account. Under the matching rule of Sec. 1.1502-13(c), the 
loss is taken into account to reflect the difference for each year 
between P's corresponding items taken into account and P's recomputed 
corresponding items (the corresponding items that P would take into 
account for the year if S and P were divisions of a single corporation). 
If S and P were divisions of a single corporation and the intercompany 
sale were a transfer between the divisions, P would succeed to S's $100 
basis and would have a $200 basis in the T stock at the time it sells 
the T stock ($100 of initial basis plus $100 under the investment 
adjustment system). S's $40 loss is taken into account at the time of 
P's sale of the T stock to reflect the $40 difference between the $60 
loss P takes into account and P's recomputed $100 loss.
    (iii) Under the matching rule of Sec. 1.1502-13(c), the attributes 
of S's $40 loss and P's $60 loss are redetermined to produce the same 
effect on consolidated taxable income (and consolidated tax liability) 
as if S and P were divisions of a single corporation. Under Sec. 
1.1502-13(b)(6), attributes of the losses include whether they are 
disallowed under this section. Because the amount described in paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section is $100, both S's $40 loss and P's $60 loss are 
disallowed.

    (d) Successors--(1) General rule. This section applies, to the 
extent necessary to effectuate the purposes of this section, to any 
property the basis of which is determined, directly or indirectly, in 
whole or in part, by reference to the basis of a subsidiary's stock.
    (2) Examples. The principles of this paragraph (d) are illustrated 
by the following examples.

    Example 1. Status of successor as member. (i) P, the common parent 
of a group, buys all the stock of T for $100. T's only asset has a basis 
of $0 and a value of $100. T sells the asset for $100, and buys another 
asset for $100. Under the investment adjustment system, P's basis in the 
T stock increases to $200, and the earnings and profits of P increase by 
$100. P later transfers all the stock of T to an unrelated consolidation 
group in exchange for 10 percent of the stock of X, the

[[Page 335]]

common parent of that group, in a transaction described in section 
368(a)(1)(B). At the time of the exchange, the value of the X stock 
received by P is $80.
    (ii) Under section 358, P has a basis of $200 in the X stock it 
receives in exchange for T. Under section 362, X has a $200 basis in the 
T stock.
    (iii) Neither paragraph (a)(1) nor (b)(1) of this section applies to 
the stock of T on P's transfer of the stock to the X group, because no 
gain or loss is recognized on the transfer, and the transfer is not a 
deconsolidation of the stock of T under paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section.
    (iv) The X stock owned by P after the reorganization is a successor 
interest to the T stock because P's basis in the X stock is determined 
by reference to P's basis in the T stock. The purposes of this section 
require that the reorganization exchange be treated as a deconsolidation 
event with respect to P's interest in the X stock. Because X is not a 
member of the P group, a failure to reduce the basis of the X stock 
owned by P to its fair market value would permit the P group to 
recognize and deduct the loss attributable to the T stock. However, 
because T is a member of the X group, a reduction in the basis of the T 
stock is not necessary to prevent the X group from recognizing and 
deducting the loss arising in the P group. The transfer of T stock to X 
therefore constitutes a deconsolidation of the X stock but not the T 
stock. Therefore, P must reduce its basis in the X stock from $200 to 
its $80 value at that time. However, X's basis in the T stock remains 
$200.
    Example 2. Continued application after deconsolidation. (i) P, the 
common parent of a group, buys all the stock of T for $100. T's only 
asset has a basis of $0 and a value of $100. T sells the asset for $100, 
and buys another asset for $100. Under the investment adjustment system, 
P's basis in the T stock increases to $200. P later transfers all the 
stock of T to partnership M in exchange for a partnership interest in M, 
in a transaction to which section 721 applies. The value of the T stock 
immediately before the transfer to M is $100. Less than 2 years later, P 
sells its interest in M for $80.
    (ii) Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, because the stock of T 
is deconsolidated on the transfer to M, immediately before the transfer 
to M, P reduces its basis in the T stock to the stock's $100 value 
immediately before the transfer. As a result, P has a basis of $100 in 
its interest in M, and M has a basis of $100 in the T stock.
    (iii) When P sells its interest in M for $80, it recognizes a $20 
loss. Because the basis of P's interest in M is determined by reference 
to P's basis in the T stock, and the reporting requirements could 
otherwise be circumvented, P's partnership interest in M is a successor 
interest to the T stock. Under paragraph (b)(5) of this section, P is 
required to file a statement with its return for the year of its 
disposition of its interest in M in order to deduct its loss. If P does 
not file the required statement described in paragraph (b)(5) of this 
section, P's loss on the disposition of its interest in M is disallowed.

    (e) Anti-avoidance rules--(1) General rule. The rules of Sec. 
1.1502-20 must be applied in a manner that is consistent with and 
reasonably carries out their purposes. If a taxpayer acts with a view to 
avoid the effect of the rules of this section, adjustments must be made 
as necessary to carry out their purposes.
    (2) Anti-stuffing rule--(i) Application. This paragraph (e)(2) 
applies if--
    (A) A transfer of any asset (including stock and securities) on or 
after March 9, 1990 is followed within 2 years by a direct or indirect 
disposition or a deconsolidation of stock, and
    (B) The transfer is with a view to avoiding, directly or indirectly, 
in whole or in part--
    (1) The disallowance of loss on the disposition or the basis 
reduction on the deconsolidation of stock of a subsidiary, or
    (2) The recognition of unrealized gain following the transfer.
    A disposition or deconsolidation after the 2-year period described 
in this paragraph (e)(2)(i) that is pursuant to an agreement, option, or 
other arrangement entered into within the 2-year period is treated as a 
disposition or deconsolidation within the 2-year period for purposes of 
this section.
    (ii) Basis reduction. If this paragraph (e)(2) applies, the basis of 
the stock is reduced, immediately before the disposition or 
deconsolidation, to cause the disallowance of loss, the reduction of 
basis, or the recognition of gain, otherwise avoided by reason of the 
transfer.
    (3) Examples. The principles of this paragraph (e) are illustrated 
by the following examples.

    Example 1. Shifting of value. (i) P buys all the stock of T for 
$100, and T becomes a member of the P group. T has an asset with a basis 
of $0 and a value of $100. With the view described in paragraph (e)(1) 
of this section, P transfers land with a value of $100 and a basis of 
$100 to T in exchange for preferred stock with a $200 redemption price 
and liquidation preference. The $100 redemption premium (the excess of 
the $200 redemption

[[Page 336]]

price over the $100 issue price) ultimately increases the value of the 
preferred stock from $100 to $200 (and decreases the value of the common 
stock). T sells the built-in gain asset for $100, and P's aggregate 
basis in S's common and preferred stock increases to $300. In addition, 
as a result of a cumulative redetermination under Sec. 1.1502-32(c)(4), 
P's basis in the T preferred stock increases from $100 to $200 and P's 
basis in the common stock remains $100. P subsequently sells the common 
stock at a loss.
    (ii) Under section 305, the redemption premium is treated as a 
distribution of property to which section 301 and Sec. 1.1502-13(f)(2) 
apply. Under Sec. Sec. 1.1502-13 and 1.1502-32, P's aggregate basis in 
the preferred and common stock is unaffected by the deemed 
distributions.
    (iii) P's loss on the sale of the common stock is disallowed under 
paragraph (e)(1) of this section. This disallowance prevents the 
preferred stock from shifting value and stock basis adjustments from the 
common stock to avoid the disallowance of loss under this section.
    Example 2. Basic stuffing case. (i) In Year 1, P buys all the stock 
of T for $100, and T becomes a member of the P group. T has an asset 
with a basis of $0 and a value of $100. T sells the asset for $100. 
Under the investment adjustment system, P's basis in the T stock 
increases from $100 to $200. In Year 5, P transfers to T an asset with a 
basis of $0 and a value of $100 in a transaction to which section 351 
applies, with the view described in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section. 
In Year 6, P sells all the stock of T for $200.
    (ii) Under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, P must reduce the 
basis in its T stock by $100 immediately before the sale. This basis 
reduction causes a $100 gain to be recognized on the sale.
    (iii) The $100 basis reduction also would be required if the T stock 
is deconsolidated in Year 6 instead of being sold. P must reduce the 
basis in its T stock by $100 immediately before the deconsolidation.
    (iv) The $100 basis reduction also would be required if the P stock 
were acquired at the beginning of Year 6 by the M consolidated group, 
even though the asset transfer took place outside the M group. Paragraph 
(e)(2)(i) of this section requires only that the transferor have the 
view at the time of the transfer.
    Example 3. Stacking rules. (i) In Year 1, P buys all the stock of T 
for $100, and T becomes a member of the P group. T has an asset with a 
basis of $0 and a value of $100. T sells the asset for $100. Under the 
investment adjustment system, P's basis in the T stock increases from 
$100 to $200. In Year 5, when the value of the T stock remains $100, P 
transfers to T an asset with a basis of $0 and a value of $100 in a 
transaction to which section 351 applies, with the view described in 
paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section. Thereafter, the value of the 
contributed asset declines to $10. In Year 6, P sells all the T stock 
for $110 and recognizes a $90 loss.
    (ii) Because the transferred asset declined in value by $90, the 
transfer enabled P to avoid the disallowance of loss by the sale of T 
only to the extent of $10. Under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, P 
must reduce the basis in its T stock immediately before the sale to 
cause recognition of gain in an amount equal to the loss disallowance 
otherwise avoided by reason of the transfer. The amount of this basis 
reduction is $100, causing a $10 gain to be recognized on the sale.
    (iii) The facts are the same as in (i) of this Example, except that 
the transferred asset does not decline in value and that T reinvests the 
$100 in proceeds from the asset sale in another asset that appreciates 
in value to $190. In Year 6, P sells T for $290. Because the new asset 
appreciated in value by $90, the transfer enabled P to avoid the 
disallowance of loss on the sale of T only to the extent of $10. Under 
paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, P must reduce the basis in its T 
stock immediately before the sale to cause recognition of gain in an 
amount equal to the loss disallowance otherwise avoided by reason of the 
transfer. The amount of this basis reduction is $10, causing a $100 gain 
to be recognized on the sale.
    Example 4. Contribution of built-in loss asset. (i) In Year 1, P 
forms S with a contribution of $100 in exchange for all of S's stock, 
and S becomes a member of the P group. S buys an asset for $100, and the 
asset appreciates in value to $200. P then buys all the stock of T for 
$100, and T becomes a member of the P group. T has an asset with a basis 
of $0 and a value of $100. T sells the asset for $100, and under the 
investment adjustment system P's basis in the T stock increases from 
$100 to $200. In Year 5, when the value of the T stock remains $100, P 
transfers the T stock to S in a transaction to which section 351 
applies, with the view described in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section. 
The transfer causes P's basis in the S stock to increase from $100 to 
$300 and the value of S to increase from $200 to $300. In Year 6, P 
sells the S stock for $300.
    (ii) Under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, P must reduce the 
basis in its S stock immediately before the sale to cause recognition of 
gain in an amount equal to the gain recognition otherwise avoided by 
reason of the transfer. The amount of this basis reduction is $100, 
causing a $100 gain to be recognized on the sale.
    Example 5. Absence of a view. (i) In Year 1, P buys all the stock of 
T for $100, and T becomes a member of the P group. T has 2 historic 
assets, asset 1 with a basis of $40 and value of $90, and asset 2 with a 
basis of $60 and value of $10. In Year 2, T sells asset 1 for $90. Under 
the investment adjustment system, P's basis in the T stock increases 
from

[[Page 337]]

$100 to $150. Asset 2 is not essential to the operation of T's business, 
and T distributes asset 2 to P in Year 5 with a view to having the group 
retain its $50 loss inherent in the asset. Under Sec. 1.1502-13(f)(2), 
and the application of the principles of this rule in section 267(f), T 
has a $50 intercompany loss that is deferred. Under Sec. 1.1502-
32(b)(3)(iv), the distribution reduces P's basis in the T stock by $10 
to $140 in Year 5. In Year 6, P sells all the T stock for $90. Under the 
acceleration rule of Sec. 1.1502-13(d), and the application of the 
principles of this rule in section 267(f), T's intercompany loss is 
ordinarily taken into account immediately before P's sale of the T 
stock. Assuming that the loss is absorbed by the group, P's basis in T's 
stock would be reduced from $140 to $90 under Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(3)(i), 
and there would be no gain or loss from the stock disposition. 
(Alternatively, if the loss is not absorbed and the loss is reattributed 
to P under paragraph (g) of this section, the reattribution would reduce 
P's basis in T's stock from $140 to $90.)
    (ii) A $50 loss is reflected both in T's basis in asset 2 and in P's 
basis in the T stock. Because the distribution results in the loss with 
respect to asset 2 being taken into account before the corresponding 
loss reflected in the T stock, and asset 2 is an historic asset of T, 
the distribution is not with the view described in paragraph (e)(2) of 
this section.
    Example 6. Extending the time period for dispositions. (i) In Year 
1, P buys all the stock of T for $100, and T becomes a member of the P 
group. T has an asset with a basis of $0 and a value of $100. T sells 
the asset for $100. Under the investment adjustment system, P's basis in 
the T stock increases from $100 to $200. At the beginning of Year 5, P 
transfers to T an asset with a basis of $0 and a value of $100 in a 
transaction to which section 351 applies, with the view described in 
paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section. Within 2 years, P agrees to sell 
all the stock of T for $200 at the end of Year 7.
    (ii) Under paragraph (e)(2) (i) of this section, P's disposition of 
the T stock at the end of Year 7 is treated as occurring within the 2-
year period following P's transfer of the asset to T, because the 
disposition is pursuant to an agreement reached within 2 years after the 
transfer. Accordingly, under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, P 
must reduce the basis in its T stock by $100 immediately before the 
sale. This result is reached whether or not the agreement is in writing. 
P's disposition would also have been treated as occurring within the 2-
year period if the disposition were pursuant to an option issued within 
the period.

    (f) No tiering up of certain adjustments--(1) General rule. If the 
basis of stock of a subsidiary (S) owned by a another member (P) is 
reduced under this section on the deconsolidation of the S stock, no 
corresponding adjustment is made under Sec. 1.1502-32 to the basis of 
the stock of P if there is a disposition or deconsolidation of the P 
stock in the same transaction. If there is a disposition or 
deconsolidation in the same transaction of less than all the stock of P, 
appropriate adjustments must be made under Sec. 1.1502-32 with respect 
to P (and any higher-tier members).
    (2) Example. The principles of this paragraph (f) are illustrated by 
the following example.

    Example. (i) P, the common parent of a group, owns all the stock of 
S, S owns all the stock of S1, and S1 owns all the stock of S2. P's 
basis in the S stock is $100, S's basis in the S1 stock is $100, and 
S1's basis in the S2 stock is $100. In Year 1, S2 buys all the stock of 
T for $100. T has an asset with a basis of $0 and a value of $100. In 
Year 2, T sells the asset for $100. Under the investment adjustment 
system, the basis of each subsidiary's stock increases from $100 to 
$200. In Year 6, S sells all the stock of S1 for $100 to A, an 
individual, and recognizes a loss of $100. S1, S2, and T are not members 
of a consolidated group immediately after the sale because the new S1 
group does not file a consolidated return for its first tax year.
    (ii) Under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, no deduction is allowed 
to S for its loss from the sale of the S1 stock. Under Sec. 1.1502-
32(b)(3)(iii), S's disallowed loss is treated as a noncapital, 
nondeductible expense for Year 6 that reduces P's basis in the S stock. 
(Under Sec. 1.1502-33, S's earnings and profits for Year 6 are reduced 
by the amount of S's disallowed loss for earnings and profits purposes 
and, under Sec. 1.1502-33(b), this reduction is reflected in P's 
earnings and profits.)
    (iii) Under paragraphs (b)(1) and (f)(1) of this section, because 
the stock of T and S2 are deconsolidated as a result of S's sale of the 
S1 stock, the basis of their stock must be reduced immediately before 
the sale from $200 to $100 (the value immediately before the 
deconsolidation). Under Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(3)(iii), the basis reductions 
are treated as noncapital, nondeductible expenses for Year 6. Under 
paragraph (f)(2) of this section, however, because the S2 stock is 
deconsolidated in the same transaction, the basis reduction to the T 
stock does not tier up under Sec. 1.1502-32(a)(3). Similarly, because 
the S1 stock is disposed of in the same transaction, the basis reduction 
to the S2 stock also does not tier up. (Comparable treatment applies for 
purposes of earnings and profits under Sec. 1.1502-33.)


[[Page 338]]


    (g) Reattribution of subsidiary's losses to common parent--(1) 
Reattribution rule. If a member disposes of stock of a subsidiary and 
the member's loss would be disallowed under paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section, the common parent may make an irrevocable election to 
reattribute to itself any portion of the net operating loss carryovers 
and net capital loss carryovers attributable to the subsidiary (and any 
lower tier subsidiary) without regard to the order in which they were 
incurred. The amount reattributed may not exceed the amount of loss that 
would be disallowed if no election is made under this paragraph (g). For 
this purpose, the amount of loss that would be disallowed is determined 
by applying paragraph (c)(1) of this section (without taking into 
account the requirement under paragraph (c)(3) of this section that a 
statement be filed) and by not taking the reattribution into account. 
The amount of loss that would be disallowed and the losses that may be 
reattributed are determined immediately after the disposition, but the 
reattribution is deemed to be made immediately before the disposition. 
The common parent succeeds to the reattributed losses as if the losses 
were succeeded to in a transaction described in section 381(a). Any 
owner shift of the subsidiary (including any deemed owner shift 
resulting from section 382(g)(4)(D) or 382(l)(3)) in connection with the 
disposition is not taken into account under section 382 with respect to 
the reattributed losses. See Sec. 1.1502-96(d) for rules relating to 
section 382 and the reattribution of losses under this paragraph (g).
    (2) Insolvency limitation. If the subsidiary whose losses are to be 
reattributed, or any higher tier subsidiary, is insolvent within the 
meaning of section 108(d)(3) at the time of the disposition, losses of 
the subsidiary may be reattributed only to the extent they exceed the 
sum of the separate insolvencies of any subsidiaries (taking into 
account only the subsidiary and its higher tier subsidiaries) that are 
insolvent. For purposes of determining insolvency, liabilities owed to 
higher tier members are not taken into account, and stock of a 
subsidiary that is limited and preferred as to dividends and that is not 
owned by higher tier members is treated as a liability to the extent of 
the amount of preferred distributions to which the stock would be 
entitled if the subsidiary were liquidated on the date of the 
disposition.
    (3) Examples. The principles of this paragraph (g) are illustrated 
by the following examples.

    Example 1. Basic reattribution case. (i) P, the common parent of a 
group, forms S with a $100 contribution. For Year 1, S has a $60 
operating loss that is not absorbed and is included in the group's 
consolidated net operating loss that is carried over under Sec. Sec. 
1.1502-21A or 1.1502-21. Under Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(3)(i), P's basis in 
the S stock is not reduced to reflect S's loss because the loss is not 
absorbed. Under Sec. 1.1502-33(b), S's deficit in earnings and profits 
is reflected in P's earnings and profits even though the loss is not 
absorbed for tax purposes. During Year 2, S's remaining assets 
appreciate in value and P sells the S stock for $55. But for an election 
to reattribute losses under paragraph (g) of this section, P would have 
a $45 loss from the sale that would be disallowed.
    (ii) P elects under paragraph (g)(1) of this section to reattribute 
to itself $45 of S's losses (the maximum amount permitted). As a result, 
$45 of the $60 net operating loss carryover attributable to S is 
reattributed to P. This reattributed loss may be included in the net 
operating loss carryover to subsequent consolidated return years of the 
P group. P succeeds to these losses as if the losses were succeeded to 
in a transaction described in section 381(a) and they retain their 
character as ordinary losses. The remaining $15 of net operating loss 
carryover attributable to S is carried over to the first separate return 
year of S.
    (iii) Under Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(3)(iii), the reattribution of $45 of 
loss is a noncapital, nondeductible expense that reduces P's basis in 
the S stock from $100 to $55 immediately before the disposition. 
Consequently, P does not recognize any gain or loss from the 
disposition.
    (iv) Assume that $20 of S's losses arose in Year 1 and $40 in Year 
2, and that P elects to reattribute all $40 from Year 2 and $5 from Year 
1. P succeeds to these losses as if the losses were succeeded to in a 
transaction described in section 381(a), and the losses retain their 
character as ordinary losses arising in Years 1 and 2. The losses 
continue to be subject to any limitations originally applicable to S, 
but P succeeds to them and may absorb the losses independently of S. 
(For example, P's use of the Year 2 losses does not depend on S's use of 
the Year 1 losses that were not reattributed to P.)
    Example 2. Lower tier subsidiary. (i) P, the common parent of a 
group, forms S with a

[[Page 339]]

$100 contribution. S then forms T with a $40 contribution and T borrows 
$60. For Year 1, S has a $30 operating loss and T has a $55 operating 
loss. The losses are not absorbed and are included in the group's 
consolidated net operating loss that is carried over under Sec. Sec. 
1.1502-21A or 1.1502-21. Under Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(3)(i), P's basis in 
the S stock, and S's basis in the T stock, are not reduced to reflect 
the S and T losses because the group is unable to absorb the losses. 
(Under Sec. 1.1502-33(b), the deficits in earnings and profits of S and 
T are tiered up for earnings and profits purposes even though not 
absorbed for tax purposes.) During Year 2, P sells the S stock for $30 
($100 invested, minus S's $30 loss and $40 unrealized loss from its 
investment in the T stock). But for an election to reattribute losses 
under paragraph (g) of this section, P would have a $70 loss from the 
sale, which would be disallowed.
    (ii) S's $30 portion of the net operating loss carryover may be 
reattributed to P under paragraph (g)(1) of this section. Because T is 
insolvent by $15, paragraph (g)(2) of this section provides that only 
$40 of its $55 portion of the net operating loss carryover may be 
reattributed to P under paragraph (g)(1) of this section. There is no 
limitation, however, on which $40 of T's $55 loss may be reattributed.
    (iii) P elects under paragraph (g)(1) of this section to reattribute 
to itself $40 of T's losses (the maximum amount permitted). P does not 
elect, however, to reattribute to itself any of S's losses. As a result, 
$40 of the $85 net operating loss carryover is reattributed to P. This 
reattributed loss may be included in the net operating loss carryover to 
subsequent consolidated return years of the P group. Of the $45 
remaining net operating loss carryover, the $15 attributable to T and 
$30 attributable to S are carried over to their first separate return 
years.
    (iv) Under Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(3)(iii), the reattribution of loss is 
a noncapital, nondeductible expense that reduces P's basis in the S 
stock to $60 immediately before the disposition. Consequently, P 
recognizes only a $30 loss from the disposition of its S stock ($30 sale 
proceeds and $60 basis), and this loss is disallowed.
    Example 3. Separate return limitation year losses. (i) P, the common 
parent of a group, buys the stock of S for $100. S has a net operating 
loss carryover of $40 from a separate return limitation year, and assets 
with a value and basis of $100. The assets of S decline in value by $40, 
and P sells all the stock of S for $60. But for an election to 
reattribute losses under this paragraph (g), P would have a $40 loss on 
the sale of S that would be disallowed.
    (ii) S's $40 loss carryover from a separate return limitation year 
may be reattributed to P under paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
    (iii) P elects under paragraph (g)(1) of this section to reattribute 
to itself S's $40 (loss the maximum amount permitted). Following the 
reattribution, the loss is included in the net operating loss carryover 
to subsequent consolidated return years of the P group.
    (iv) Under Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(3)(iii), the reattribution of loss is 
a noncapital, nondeductible expense that reduces P's basis in the S 
stock to $60 immediately before the disposition. Consequently, P 
recognizes no gain or loss from the disposition of its S stock. For P's 
treatment of the $40 reattributed loss, see Sec. 1.1502-1(f).

    (4) Time and manner of making the election--(i) In general. The 
election described in paragraph (g)(1) of this section must be made in a 
separate statement entitled ``this is an election under Sec. 1.1502-
20(g)(1) To reattribute losses of [insert names and employer 
identification numbers (E.I.N.) of each subsidiary whose losses are 
reattributed] to [insert name and employer identification number of 
common parent].'' The statement must include the following information--
    (A) For each subsidiary, the amount of each net operating loss and 
net capital loss, and the year in which each arose, that is reattributed 
to the common parent;
    (B) If a subsidiary ceases to be a member, the name and employer 
identification number of the person acquiring the subsidiary's stock; 
and
    (C) If the common parent is reattributing to itself all or any part 
of a section 382 limitation pursuant to Sec. 1.1502-96(d)(5), the 
information required by paragraph (g)(4)(ii) of this section.
    The statement must be signed by the common parent, and by each 
subsidiary with respect to which loss is reattributed under this 
paragraph (g) that does not remain a member of the common parent's group 
immediately following the disposition. The statement must be filed with 
the group's income tax return for the tax year of the disposition and a 
copy of the statement must be retained by the subsidiary. If the 
acquirer is a subsidiary in a consolidated group, the name and employer 
identification number of the common parent of the group must be included 
in the statement, and a copy of the statement must also be delivered to 
the common parent.

[[Page 340]]

    (ii) Reattribution of section 382 limitation. The information 
required by this paragraph (g)(4)(ii) is a separate list for each 
subsidiary (or a separate list for two or more subsidiaries that are 
members of a loss subgroup whose pre-change subgroup losses are being 
reattributed) with respect to which an apportionment of a separate 
section 382 limitation or subgroup section 382 limitation is being made, 
setting forth--
    (A) The name and E.I.N. of the subsidiary (or subsidiaries that were 
members of a loss subgroup);
    (B) A statement entitled ``THIS IS AN ELECTION UNDER Sec. 1.1502-
96(d)(5) TO APPORTION ALL OR PART OF [insert A SEPARATE or A SUBGROUP or 
BOTH A SEPARATE AND A SUBGROUP] SECTION 382 LIMITATION TO [insert name 
and E.I.N. of the common parent]'';
    (C) The date of the ownership change giving rise to the separate 
section 382 limitation or subgroup section 382 limitation that is being 
apportioned;
    (D) The amount of the separate (or subgroup) section 382 limitation 
for the taxable year in which the reattribution occurs (determined 
without reference to any apportionment under this section or Sec. 
1.1502-95(c));
    (E) The amount of each net operating loss carryover or capital loss 
carryover, and the year in which it arose, of the subsidiary (or 
subsidiaries) that is subject to the separate section 382 limitation or 
subgroup section 382 limitation that is being apportioned to the common 
parent, and the amount of the value element and adjustment element of 
that limitation that is apportioned to the common parent.
    (iii) Filing of subsidiary's copy of statement. The subsidiary whose 
losses are reattributed (or the common parent of any consolidated group 
that acquires the subsidiary or lower tier subsidiary) must attach its 
copy of the statement described in paragraph (g)(5)(i) of this section 
to its income return for the first tax year ending after the due date, 
including extensions, of the return in which the election required by 
paragraph (g)(5)(i) of this section is to be filed.
    (h) Effective dates--(1) General rule. Except as otherwise provided 
in this paragraph (h), this section applies with respect to dispositions 
and deconsolidations on or after February 1, 1991. For this purpose, 
dispositions deferred under Sec. 1.1502-13 are deemed to occur at the 
time the deferred gain or loss is taken into account unless the stock 
was deconsolidated before February 1, 1991. If stock of a subsidiary 
became worthless during a taxable year including February 1, 1991, the 
disposition with respect to the stock is treated as occurring on the 
date the stock became worthless.
    (2) Election to accelerate effective date--(i) In general. A group 
may make an irrevocable election to apply this section to all its 
members, instead of Sec. 1.337(d)-2, with respect to all dispositions 
and deconsolidations on or after November 19, 1990.
    (ii) Time and manner of making the election--in general. The 
election described in paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section must be made 
in a separate statement entitled ``this is an election under Sec. 
1.1502-20(h)(2) to accelerate the application of Sec. 1.1502-20 to the 
consolidated group of which [insert name and employer identification 
number of common parent] is the common parent.'' The statement must be 
signed by the common parent and filed with the group's income tax return 
for the tax year of the first disposition or deconsolidation to which 
the election applies. If the separate statement required under this 
paragraph (h) (2) (ii) is to be filed with a return the due date 
(including extensions) of which is before April 16, 1991, the statement 
may be filed with an amended return for the year of the disposition or 
deconsolidation. Any other filings required under this Sec. 1.1502-20, 
such as the statement required under Sec. 1.1502-20(c)(3), which 
ordinarily cannot be made with an amended return, must be made at such 
time and in such manner as permitted by the Commissioner.
    (3) Binding contract rule. For purposes of this paragraph (h), if a 
disposition or deconsolidation is pursuant to a binding written contract 
entered into before March 9, 1990, and in continuous effect until the 
disposition or deconsolidation, the date the contract became binding is 
treated as the date of the disposition or deconsolidation.

[[Page 341]]

    (4) Application of Sec. 1.1502-20T to certain transactions--(i) In 
general. If a group files the certification described in paragraph 
(h)(4)(ii) of this section, it may apply Sec. 1.1502-20T (as contained 
in the CFR edition revised as of April 1, 1990), to all of its members 
with respect to all dispositions and deconsolidations by the certifying 
group to which Sec. 1.1502-20T otherwise applied by its terms 
occurring--
    (A) On or after March 9, 1990 (but only if not pursuant to a binding 
contract described in Sec. 1.337(d)-1T(e)(2) (as contained in the CFR 
edition revised as of April 1, 1990) that was entered into before March 
9, 1990); and
    (B) Before November 19, 1990 (or thereafter, if pursuant to a 
binding contract described in Sec. 1.1502-20T(g)(3) that was entered 
into on or after March 9, 1990 and before November 19, 1990).
    The certification under this paragraph (h)(4)(i) with respect to the 
application of Sec. 1.1502-20T to any transaction described in this 
paragraph (h)(4)(i) may not be withdrawn and, if the certification is 
filed, Sec. 1.1502-20T must be applied to all such transactions on all 
returns (including amended returns) on which such transactions are 
included.
    (ii) Time and manner of filing certification. The certification 
described in paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section must be made in a 
separate statement entitled ``[insert name and employer identification 
number of common parent] hereby certifies under Sec. 1.1502-20 (h)(4) 
that the group of which it is the common parent is applying Sec. 
1.1502-20T to all transactions to which that section otherwise applied 
by its terms.'' The statement must be signed by the common parent and 
filed with the group's income tax return for the taxable year of the 
first disposition or deconsolidation to which the certification applies. 
If the separate statement required under this paragraph (h)(4) is to be 
filed with a return the due date (including extensions) of which is 
before November 16, 1991, the statement may be filed with an amended 
return for the year of the disposition or deconsolidation that is filed 
within 180 days after September 13, 1991. Any other filings required 
under Sec. 1.1502-20T, such as the statement required under Sec. 
1.1502-20T(f)(5), may be made with the amended return, regardless of 
whether Sec. 1.1502-20T permits such filing by amended return.
    (5) Cross reference. For transitional loss limitation rules, see 
Sec. Sec. 1.337(d)-1 and 1.337(d)-2.

Sec. 1.1502-20T  Disposition or deconsolidation of subsidiary stock (temporary).

    (a) through (h) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1502-
20(a) through (h).
    (i) Limitations on the applicability of Sec. 1.1502-20--(1) 
Dispositions and deconsolidations on or after March 7, 2002. Except to 
the extent specifically incorporated in Sec. 1.337(d)-2T, Sec. 1.1502-
20 does not apply to a disposition or deconsolidation of stock of a 
subsidiary on or after March 7, 2002, unless the disposition or 
deconsolidation was effected pursuant to a binding written contract 
entered into before March 7, 2002, that was in continuous effect until 
the disposition or deconsolidation.
    (2) Dispositions and deconsolidations prior to March 7, 2002. In the 
case of a disposition or deconsolidation of stock of a subsidiary by a 
member before March 7, 2002, or a disposition or deconsolidation on or 
after March 7, 2002, that was effected pursuant to a binding written 
contract entered into before March 7, 2002, that was in continuous 
effect until the disposition or deconsolidation, a consolidated group 
may determine the amount of the member's allowable loss or basis 
reduction by applying Sec. 1.1502-20 in its entirety, or, in lieu 
thereof, subject to the conditions set forth in this paragraph (i), by 
making an irrevocable election to apply the provisions of either--
    (i) Section 1.1502-20, except that in applying Sec. 1.1502-
20(c)(1), the amount of

[[Page 342]]

loss disallowed under Sec. 1.1502-20(a)(1) and the amount of basis 
reduction under Sec. 1.1502-20(b)(1) with respect to a share of stock 
will not exceed the sum of the amounts described in Sec. 1.1502-
20(c)(1)(i) and (ii); or
    (ii) Section 1.337(d)-2T.
    (3) Operating rules--(i) Reattribution of losses in the case of an 
election to determine allowable loss by applying the provisions 
described in paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section. If a consolidated 
group elects to determine allowable loss by applying the provisions 
described in paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section, an election described 
in Sec. 1.1502-20(g) to reattribute losses will be respected only if 
the requirements of Sec. 1.1502-20(g), including the requirement that 
the election be filed with the group's income tax return for the year of 
the disposition, have been or are satisfied. For example, if a 
consolidated group did not file a valid election described in Sec. 
1.1502-20(g) with its return for the year of the disposition, this 
section does not authorize the group that disposed of the stock to make 
such an election with its return for the year in which it elects to 
determine its allowable stock loss under the provisions described in 
paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section. If a consolidated group that made a 
valid election described in Sec. 1.1502-20(g) with respect to the 
disposition of stock elects to determine allowable loss by applying the 
provisions described in paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section, the 
election described in Sec. 1.1502-20(g) may not be revoked, and the 
amount of loss treated as reattributed as of the time of the disposition 
pursuant to the election described in Sec. 1.1502-20(g) is the amount 
of loss originally reattributed, reduced to the extent that it exceeds 
the greater of--
    (A) The amount of stock loss disallowed after applying the 
provisions described in paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section; and
    (B) The amount of reattributed losses that the group that disposed 
of the stock absorbed in years for which the assessment of a deficiency 
is prevented by any law or rule of law as of the date the election to 
apply the provisions described in paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section is 
filed and at all times thereafter.
    (ii) Reattribution of losses in the case of an election to determine 
allowable loss by applying the provisions described in paragraph 
(i)(2)(ii) of this section. If a consolidated group elects to determine 
allowable loss by applying the provisions described in paragraph 
(i)(2)(ii) of this section, the consolidated group may not make an 
election described in Sec. 1.1502-20(g) to reattribute any losses. If 
the consolidated group made an election described in Sec. 1.1502-20(g) 
with respect to the disposition of subsidiary stock, the amount of loss 
treated as reattributed pursuant to such election will be the greater 
of--
    (A) Zero; and
    (B) The amount of reattributed losses that the group that disposed 
of the stock absorbed in years for which the assessment of a deficiency 
is prevented by any law or rule of law as of the date the election to 
apply the provisions described in paragraph (i)(2)(ii) of this section 
is filed and at all times thereafter.
    (iii) Apportionment of section 382 limitation in the case of a 
reduction of reattributed losses--(A) Losses subject to a separate 
section 382 limitation. If, as a result of the application of paragraph 
(i)(3)(i) or (ii) and paragraph (i)(3)(vii) of this section, pre-change 
separate attributes that were subject to a separate section 382 
limitation are treated as losses of a subsidiary and the common parent 
previously elected to apportion all or a part of such limitation to 
itself under Sec. 1.1502-96(d), the common parent may reduce the amount 
of such limitation apportioned to itself.
    (B) Losses subject to a subgroup section 382 limitation. If, as a 
result of the application of paragraph (i)(3)(i) or (ii) and paragraph 
(i)(3)(vii) of this section, pre-change subgroup attributes that were 
subject to a subgroup section 382 limitation are treated as losses of a 
subsidiary and the common parent previously elected to apportion all or 
a part of such limitation to itself under Sec. 1.1502-96(d), the common 
parent may reduce the amount of such limitation apportioned to itself. 
In addition, if such subsidiary has ceased to be a member of the loss 
subgroup to which the pre-change subgroup attributes relate, the common 
parent may increase

[[Page 343]]

the total amount of such limitation apportioned to such subsidiary (or 
loss subgroup that includes such subsidiary) under Sec. 1.1502-95(c) by 
an amount not in excess of the amount by which such limitation that is 
apportioned to the common parent is reduced pursuant to the previous 
sentence.
    (C) Losses subject to a consolidated section 382 limitation. If, as 
a result of the application of paragraph (i)(3)(i) or (ii) and paragraph 
(i)(3)(vii) of this section, pre-change consolidated attributes (or pre-
change subgroup attributes) that were subject to a consolidated section 
382 limitation (or subgroup section 382 limitation where the common 
parent was a member of the loss subgroup) are treated as losses of a 
subsidiary, and the subsidiary has ceased to be a member of the loss 
group (or loss subgroup), the common parent may increase the amount of 
such limitation that is apportioned to such subsidiary (or loss subgroup 
that includes such subsidiary) under Sec. 1.1502-95(c). The amount of 
each element of such limitation that can be apportioned to a subsidiary 
(or loss subgroup that includes such subsidiary) pursuant to this 
paragraph (i)(3)(iii)(C), however, cannot exceed the product of (x) the 
element and (y) a fraction the numerator of which is the amount of pre-
change consolidated attributes (or subgroup attributes) subject to that 
limitation that are treated as losses of the subsidiary (or loss 
subgroup) as a result of the application of paragraph (i)(3)(i) or (ii) 
and paragraph (i)(3)(vii) of this section and the denominator of which 
is the total amount of pre-change attributes subject to that limitation 
determined as of the close of the taxable year in which the subsidiary 
ceases to be a member of the group (or loss subgroup).
    (D) Operating rules--(i) Limitations on apportionment. In making any 
adjustment to an apportionment of a subgroup section 382 limitation or a 
consolidated section 382 limitation pursuant to paragraph (i)(3)(iii)(B) 
or (C) of this section, the common parent must take into account the 
extent, if any, to which such limitation has previously been apportioned 
to another subsidiary or loss subgroup prior to the date the election to 
apply the provisions described in paragraph (i)(2)(i) or (ii) of this 
section is filed.
     (ii) Manner and effect of adjustment to previous apportionment of 
limitation to common parent. Any reduction in a previous apportionment 
of a separate section 382 limitation or a subgroup section 382 
limitation to the common parent made pursuant to paragraph 
(i)(3)(iii)(A) or (B) of this section is treated as effective when the 
previous apportionment was effective. Any such adjustment must be made 
in a manner consistent with the principles of Sec. 1.1502-95(c). For 
example, to the extent the apportionment of a separate section 382 
limitation or a subgroup section 382 limitation to a common parent is 
reduced pursuant to paragraph (i)(3)(iii)(A) or (B) of this section, the 
amount of such limitation available to the subsidiary or loss subgroup, 
as applicable, is increased.
     (iii) Manner and effect of adjustment to apportionment of 
limitation to departing subsidiary or loss subgroup. Any increase in an 
amount of a subgroup section 382 limitation or a consolidated section 
382 limitation apportioned to a departing subsidiary (or loss subgroup 
that includes such subsidiary) made pursuant to paragraph (i)(3)(iii)(B) 
or (C) of this section is treated as effective for taxable years ending 
after the date the subsidiary ceases to be a member of the group or loss 
subgroup. Any such adjustment may be made regardless of whether the 
common parent previously elected to apportion all or a part of such 
limitation to such subsidiary (or loss subgroup that includes such 
subsidiary) under Sec. 1.1502-95(c) or 1.1502-95A(c), but must be made 
in a manner consistent with the principles of Sec. 1.1502-95(c). For 
example, to the extent the apportionment of an element of a subgroup 
section 382 limitation or a consolidated section 382 limitation to a 
departing subsidiary is increased pursuant to paragraph (i)(3)(iii)(B) 
or (C) of this section, the amount of such element of such limitation 
that is available to the loss subgroup or loss group is reduced 
consistent with Sec. 1.1502-95(c)(3).
     (iv) Prohibition against other adjustments. This paragraph 
(i)(3)(iii) does not authorize the common parent to

[[Page 344]]

adjust the apportionment of any separate section 382 limitation, 
subgroup section 382 limitation, or consolidated section 382 limitation 
that it previously apportioned to a subsidiary, to a loss subgroup, or 
to itself under Sec. 1.1502-95(c), 1.1502-95A(c), or 1.1502-96(d), 
other than as provided in paragraphs (i)(3)(iii)(A), (B), and (C) of 
this section.
    (E) Time and manner of making apportionment adjustment. An 
adjustment to the apportionment of any separate section 382 limitation, 
subgroup section 382 limitation, or consolidated section 382 limitation 
pursuant to paragraph (i)(3)(iii)(A), (B), or (C) of this section must 
be made as part of the group's election to apply the provisions of 
paragraph (i)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section, as described in paragraph 
(i)(4) of this section.
    (iv) Notification of reduction of reattributed losses and adjustment 
of apportionment of section 382 limitation. If the application of 
paragraph (i)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section results in a reduction of 
the losses treated as reattributed pursuant to an election described in 
Sec. 1.1502-20(g), then, prior to the date that the group files its 
income tax return for the taxable year that includes March 7, 2002, the 
common parent must send the notification required by this paragraph to 
the subsidiary, at the subsidiary's last known address. In addition, if 
the acquirer of the subsidiary stock was a member of a consolidated 
group at the time of the disposition, the common parent must send a copy 
of such notification to the person that was the common parent of the 
acquirer's group at the time of the acquisition, at its last known 
address. The notification is to be in the form of a statement entitled 
``Recomputation of Losses Reattributed Pursuant to the Election 
Described in Sec. 1.1502-20(g),'' that is signed by the common parent 
and that includes the following information--
    (A) The name and employer identification number (E.I.N.) of the 
subsidiary;
    (B) The original and the recomputed amount of losses treated as 
reattributed pursuant to the election described in Sec. 1.1502-20(g); 
and
    (C) If the apportionment of a separate section 382 limitation, a 
subgroup section 382 limitation, or a consolidated section 382 
limitation is adjusted pursuant to paragraph (i)(3)(iii)(A), (B), or (C) 
of this section, the original and the adjusted apportionment of such 
limitation.
    (v) Items taken into account in open years--(A) General rule. An 
election under paragraph (i)(2) of this section affects a taxpayer's 
items of income, gain, deduction, or loss only to the extent that the 
election gives rise, directly or indirectly, to items or amounts that 
would properly be taken into account in a year for which an assessment 
of deficiency or a refund of overpayment, as the case may be, is not 
prevented by any law or rule of law. Under this paragraph, if the 
election increases the loss allowed with respect to a disposition of 
subsidiary stock, but the year of the disposition (or the year to which 
such loss would have been carried back or carried forward) is a year for 
which a refund of overpayment is prevented by law, to the extent that 
the absorption of such excess loss in such year would have affected the 
tax treatment of another item (e.g., another loss that was absorbed in 
such year) that has an effect in a year for which a refund of 
overpayment is not prevented by any law or rule of law, the election 
will affect the treatment of such other item. Therefore, if the 
absorption of the excess loss in the year of the disposition (which is a 
year for which a refund of overpayment is prevented by law) would have 
prevented the absorption of another loss (the second loss) in such year 
and such loss would have been carried to and used in a year for which a 
refund of overpayment is not prevented by any law or rule of law (the 
other year), the election makes the second loss available for use in the 
other year.
    (B) Special rule. If a member's basis in stock of a subsidiary was 
reduced pursuant to Sec. 1.1502-32 because a loss with respect to stock 
of a lower-tier subsidiary was treated as disallowed under Sec. 1.1502-
20, then, to the extent such disallowed loss is allowed as a result of 
an election under paragraph (i) of the section but would have been 
properly absorbed or expired in a year for which a

[[Page 345]]

refund of overpayment is prevented by law or rule of law, the member's 
basis in the subsidiary stock may be increased for purposes of 
determining the group's or the shareholder-member's Federal income tax 
liability in all years for which a refund of overpayment is not 
prevented by law or rule of law.
    (vi) Conforming amendments for items previously taken into account 
in open years. To the extent that, on any Federal income tax return, the 
common parent absorbed losses that were reattributed pursuant to an 
election described in Sec. 1.1502-20(g) and the amount of losses so 
absorbed is in excess of the amount of losses that are treated as 
reattributed after application of paragraph (i)(3)(i) or (ii) of this 
section, or that may be taken into account after any adjustment to an 
apportionment of a separate section 382 limitation, a subgroup section 
382 limitation, or a consolidated section 382 limitation pursuant to 
paragraph (i)(3)(iii) of this section, such returns must be amended to 
the greatest extent possible to reflect the reduction in the amount of 
losses treated as reattributed and any adjustment to the apportionment 
of such limitation.
    (vii) Availability of losses to subsidiary. To the extent that any 
losses of a subsidiary are reattributed to the common parent pursuant to 
an election described in Sec. 1.1502-20(g), such reattribution is 
binding on the subsidiary and any group of which the subsidiary is or 
becomes a member. Therefore, if the subsidiary ceases to be a member of 
the group, any reattributed losses are not thereafter available to the 
subsidiary and may not be utilized by the subsidiary or any other group 
of which such subsidiary is or becomes a member. To the extent that the 
application of paragraph (i)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section results in a 
reduction in the amount of losses treated as reattributed to the common 
parent pursuant to an election described in Sec. 1.1502-20(g), however, 
losses in the amount of such reduction are available to the subsidiary 
and may be utilized by the subsidiary or any group of which such 
subsidiary is a member, subject to applicable limitations (e.g., section 
382).
    (viii) Apportionment of section 382 limitation in the case of an 
amendment of an election made pursuant to Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(4). (A) In 
general. If, in connection with a disposition or deconsolidation of 
subsidiary stock, the subsidiary the stock of which was disposed of or 
deconsolidated became a member of another consolidated group (the 
acquiring group), and, pursuant to Sec. 1.1502-32T(b)(4)(vii), the 
acquiring group amends an election made pursuant to Sec. 1.1502-
32(b)(4) to treat all or a portion of the loss carryovers of such 
subsidiary (or a lower-tier corporation of such subsidiary) as expiring 
for all Federal income tax purposes, then the common parent may 
reapportion a separate, subgroup, or consolidated section 382 limitation 
with respect to such subsidiary or lower-tier corporation in a manner 
consistent with the principles of paragraph (i)(3)(iii)(A) through (D) 
of this section. Any reapportionment of a section 382 limitation made 
pursuant to the previous sentence shall have the effects described in 
paragraph (i)(3)(iii)(D)(ii) and (iii) of this section. For purposes of 
this section, a lower-tier corporation is a corporation that was a 
member of the group of which the subsidiary was a member immediately 
before becoming a member of the acquiring group and that became a member 
of the acquiring group as a result of the subsidiary becoming a member 
of the acquiring group.
    (B) Time and manner of adjustment of apportionment of section 382 
limitation. The common parent must include a statement entitled 
Adjustment of Apportionment of Section 382 Limitation in Connection with 
Amendment of Election under Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(4) with or as part of any 
timely filed (including any extensions) original return for a taxable 
year that includes any date on or before May 7, 2003 or with or as part 
of an amended return filed before the date the original return for the 
taxable year that includes May 7, 2003 is due (with regard to 
extensions). The statement must set forth the name and employer 
identification number (E.I.N.) of the subsidiary and both the original 
and the adjusted apportionment of a separate section 382 limitation, a 
subgroup

[[Page 346]]

section 382 limitation, and a consolidated section 382 limitation, as 
applicable. The requirements of this paragraph (i)(3)(viii)(B) will be 
treated as satisfied if the information required by this paragraph 
(i)(3)(viii)(B) is included in the statement required by paragraph 
(i)(4) of this section rather than in a separate statement.
    (C) Effective date. This paragraph (i)(3)(viii) is applicable on and 
after May 7, 2003.
    (4) Time and manner of making the election. An election to determine 
allowable loss or basis reduction by applying the provisions described 
in paragraph (i)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section is made by including the 
statement required by this paragraph with or as part of any timely filed 
(including any extensions) original return for a taxable year that 
includes any date on or before March 7, 2002, or, if the date of the 
disposition or deconsolidation of the stock of the subsidiary is after 
March 7, 2002, then such date, or with or as part of an amended return 
filed before the date the original return for the taxable year that 
includes March 7, 2002, is due (including any extensions). Filing a 
statement in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph satisfies 
the requirement to file a ``statement of allowed loss'' otherwise 
imposed under Sec. 1.1502-20(c)(3) or Sec. 1.337(d)-2T(c)(3). The 
statement required by this paragraph satisfies the requirement that a 
statement be filed in order to claim allowable loss or basis reduction 
by applying the provisions described in paragraph (i)(2)(i) or (ii). The 
statement filed under this paragraph shall be entitled ``Allowed Loss 
under Section [Specify Section under Which Allowed Loss Is Determined] 
Pursuant to Section 1.1502-20T(i)'' and must include the following 
information--
    (i) The name and employer identification number (E.I.N.) of the 
subsidiary and of the member(s) that disposed of the subsidiary stock;
    (ii) In the case of an election to determine allowable loss or basis 
reduction by applying the provisions described in paragraph (i)(2)(i) of 
this section, a statement that the taxpayer elects to determine 
allowable loss or basis reduction by applying such provisions;
    (iii) In the case of an election to determine allowable loss or 
basis reduction by applying the provisions described in paragraph 
(i)(2)(ii) of this section, a statement that the taxpayer elects to 
determine allowable loss or basis reduction by applying such provisions;
    (iv) If an election described in Sec. 1.1502-20(g) was made with 
respect to the disposition of the stock of the subsidiary, the amount of 
losses originally treated as reattributed pursuant to such election and 
the amount of losses treated as reattributed pursuant to paragraph 
(i)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section;
    (v) If an apportionment of a separate section 382 limitation, a 
subgroup section 382 limitation, or a consolidated section 382 
limitation is adjusted pursuant to paragraph (i)(3)(iii)(A), (B), or (C) 
of this section, the original and redetermined apportionment of such 
limitation; and
    (vi) If the application of paragraph (i)(3)(i) or (ii) of this 
section results in a reduction of the amount of losses treated as 
reattributed pursuant to an election described in Sec. 1.1502-20(g), a 
statement that the notification described in paragraph (i)(3)(iv) of 
this section was sent to the subsidiary and, if the acquirer was a 
member of a consolidated group at the time of the stock sale, to the 
person that was the common parent of such group at such time, as 
required by paragraph (i)(3)(iv) of this section.
    (5) Special time for filing election in the case of a waiver under 
Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(4). (i) In general. Notwithstanding the provisions of 
paragraph (i)(4) of this section, the election to determine allowable 
loss or basis reduction provided in this paragraph (i) may be made by 
including the statement required by paragraph (i)(4) of this section 
with or as part of an original or amended return that is filed on or 
before June 15, 2003, if--
    (A) The group that includes the acquirer of the subsidiary stock 
made an election pursuant to Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(4) to treat all or a 
portion of the loss carryovers of the subsidiary (or a lower-tier 
corporation of such subsidiary) as expiring for all Federal income tax 
purposes;

[[Page 347]]

    (B) The timely filing of an election to determine allowable loss or 
basis reduction by applying the provisions described in paragraph 
(i)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section would permit the acquiring group to 
amend its election under Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(4) pursuant to Sec. 1.1502-
32T(b)(4)(vii);
    (C) June 6, 2003 is after the date the original return of the 
consolidated group for the taxable year that includes March 7, 2002, is 
due (including extensions); and
    (D) The statement required by paragraph (i)(4) of this section 
specifies that the filing of the election is permitted under this 
paragraph (i)(5).
    (ii) Effective date. This paragraph (i)(5) is applicable on and 
after May 7, 2003.
    (6) Cross references. See Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(4)(v) for a special 
rule for filing a waiver of loss carryovers.

                    Computation of Consolidated Items


<R05>
Sec. 1.1502-21  Net operating losses.

    (a) Consolidated net operating loss deduction. The consolidated net 
operating loss deduction (or CNOL deduction) for any consolidated return 
year is the aggregate of the net operating loss carryovers and 
carrybacks to the year. The net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks 
consist of--
    (1) Any CNOLs (as defined in paragraph (e) of this section) of the 
consolidated group; and
    (2) Any net operating losses of the members arising in separate 
return years.
    (b) Net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks to consolidated 
return and separate return years. Net operating losses of members 
arising during a consolidated return year are taken into account in 
determining the group's CNOL under paragraph (e) of this section for 
that year. Losses taken into account in determining the CNOL may be 
carried to other taxable years (whether consolidated or separate) only 
under this paragraph (b).
    (1) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1502-21T(b)(1).
    (2) Carryovers and carrybacks of CNOLs to separate return years--(i) 
In general. If any CNOL that is attributable to a member may be carried 
to a separate return year of the member, the amount of the CNOL that is 
attributable to the member is apportioned to the member (apportioned 
loss) and carried to the separate return year. If carried back to a 
separate return year, the apportioned loss may not be carried back to an 
equivalent, or earlier, consolidated return year of the group; if 
carried over to a separate return year, the apportioned loss may not be 
carried over to an equivalent, or later, consolidated return year of the 
group.
    (ii) Special rules--(A) Year of departure from group. If a 
corporation ceases to be a member during a consolidated return year, net 
operating loss carryovers attributable to the corporation are first 
carried to the consolidated return year, and only the amount so 
attributable that is not absorbed by the group in that year is carried 
to the corporation's first separate return year. For rules concerning a 
member departing a subgroup, see paragraph (c)(2)(vii) of this section.
    (B) Offspring rule. In the case of a member that has been a member 
continuously since its organization (determined without regard to 
whether the member is a successor to any other corporation), the CNOL 
attributable to the member is included in the carrybacks to consolidated 
return years before the member's existence. If the group did not file a 
consolidated return for a carryback year, the loss may be carried back 
to a separate return year of the common parent under paragraph (b)(2)(i) 
of this section, but only if the common parent was not a member of a 
different consolidated group or of an affiliated group filing separate 
returns for the year to which the loss is carried or any subsequent year 
in the carryback period. Following an acquisition described in Sec. 
1.1502-75(d)(2) or (3), references to the common parent are to the 
corporation that was the common parent immediately before the 
acquisition.
    (iii) Equivalent years. Taxable years are equivalent if they bear 
the same numerical relationship to the consolidated return year in which 
a CNOL

[[Page 348]]

arises, counting forward or backward from the year of the loss. For 
example, in the case of a member's third taxable year (which was a 
separate return year) that preceded the consolidated return year in 
which the loss arose, the equivalent year is the third consolidated 
return year preceding the consolidated return year in which the loss 
arose. See paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section for certain short 
taxable years that are disregarded in making this determination.
    (iv) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1502-
21T(b)(2)(iv).
    (v) Examples. For purposes of the examples in this section, unless 
otherwise stated, all groups file consolidated returns, all corporations 
have calendar taxable years, the facts set forth the only corporate 
activity, value means fair market value and the adjusted basis of each 
asset equals its value, all transactions are with unrelated persons, and 
the application of any limitation or threshold under section 382 is 
disregarded. The principles of this paragraph (b)(2) are illustrated by 
the following examples:

    Example 1. Offspring rule. (i) During Year 1, Individual A forms P 
and T, and they each file a separate return. P forms S on March 15 of 
Year 2, and P and S file a consolidated return. P acquires all the stock 
of T from Individual A at the beginning of Year 3, and T becomes a 
member of the P group. P's acquisition of T is not an ownership change 
within the meaning of section 382. P, S, and T sustain a $1,100 CNOL in 
Year 3 and, under paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section, the loss is 
attributable $200 to P, $300 to S, and $600 to T.
    (ii) Of the $1,100 CNOL in Year 3, the $500 amount of the CNOL that 
is attributable to P and S ($200 + $300) may be carried to P's separate 
return in Year 1. Even though S was not in existence in Year 1, the $300 
amount of the CNOL attributable to S may be carried back to P's separate 
return in Year 1 because S (unlike T) has been a member of the P group 
since its organization and P is a qualified parent under paragraph 
(b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section. To the extent not absorbed in that year, 
the loss may then be carried to the P group's return in Year 2. The $600 
amount of the CNOL attributable to T is a net operating loss carryback 
to T's separate return in Year 1, and if not absorbed in Year 1, then to 
Year 2.
    Example 2. Departing members. (i) The facts are the same as in 
Example 1. In addition, on June 15 of Year 4, P sells all the stock of 
T. The P group's consolidated return for Year 4 includes the income of T 
through June 15. T files a separate return for the period from June 16 
through December 31.
    (ii) $600 of the Year 3 CNOL attributable to T is apportioned to T 
and is carried back to its separate return in Year 1. To the extent the 
$600 is not absorbed in T's separate return in Year 1 or Year 2, it is 
carried to the consolidated return in Year 4 before being carried to T's 
separate return in Year 4. Any portion of the loss not absorbed in T's 
Year 1 or Year 2 or in the P group's Year 4 is then carried to T's 
separate return in Year 4.
    Example 3. Offspring rule following acquisition. (i) Individual A 
owns all of the stock of P, the common parent of a consolidated group. 
In Year 1, B, an individual unrelated to Individual A, forms T. P 
acquires all of the stock of T at the beginning of Year 3, and T becomes 
a member of the P group. The P group has $200 of consolidated taxable 
income in Year 2, and $300 of consolidated taxable income in Year 3 
(computed without regard to the CNOL deduction). At the beginning of 
Year 4, T forms a subsidiary, Y, in a transaction described in section 
351. The P group has a $300 consolidated net operating loss in Year 4, 
and under paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section, the loss is attributable 
entirely to Y.
    (ii) Even though Y was not in existence in Year 2, $300, the amount 
of the consolidated net operating loss attributable to Y, may be carried 
back to the P group's Year 2 consolidated return under paragraph 
(b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section because Y has been a member of the P group 
since its organization. To the extent not absorbed in that year, the 
loss may then be carried to the P group's consolidated return in Year 3.

    (3) Special rules--(i) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see Sec. 
1.1502-21T(b)(3)(i).
    (ii) Special elections--(A) Groups that include insolvent financial 
institutions. For rules applicable to relinquishing the entire carryback 
period with respect to losses attributable to insolvent financial 
institutions, see Sec. 301.6402-7 of this chapter.
    (B) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1502-
21T(b)(3)(ii)(B).
    (C) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1502-
21T(b)(3)(ii)(C).
    (iii) Short years in connection with transactions to which section 
381(a) applies. If a member distributes or transfers assets to a 
corporation that is a member immediately after the distribution or 
transfer in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, the 
transaction does not cause the distributor or transferor to have a short

[[Page 349]]

year within the consolidated return year of the group in which the 
transaction occurred that is counted as a separate year for purposes of 
determining the years to which a net operating loss may be carried.
    (iv) Special status losses. [Reserved]
    (v) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1502-21T(b)(3)(v).
    (c) Limitations on net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks from 
separate return limitation years--(1) SRLY limitation--(i) General rule. 
Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section (relating to an 
overlap with section 382), the aggregate of the net operating loss 
carryovers and carrybacks of a member arising (or treated as arising) in 
SRLYs that are included in the CNOL deductions for all consolidated 
return years of the group under paragraph (a) of this section may not 
exceed the aggregate consolidated taxable income for all consolidated 
return years of the group determined by reference to only the member's 
items of income, gain, deduction, and loss. For this purpose--
    (A) Consolidated taxable income is computed without regard to CNOL 
deductions;
    (B) Consolidated taxable income takes into account the member's 
losses and deductions (including capital losses) actually absorbed by 
the group in consolidated return years (whether or not absorbed by the 
member);
    (C) In computing consolidated taxable income, the consolidated 
return years of the group include only those years, including the year 
to which the loss is carried, that the member has been continuously 
included in the group's consolidated return, but exclude--
    (1) For carryovers, any years ending after the year to which the 
loss is carried; and
    (2) For carrybacks, any years ending after the year in which the 
loss arose; and
    (D) The treatment under Sec. 1.1502-15 of a built-in loss as a 
hypothetical net operating loss carryover in the year recognized is 
solely for purposes of determining the limitation under this paragraph 
(c) with respect to the loss in that year and not for any other purpose. 
Thus, for purposes of determining consolidated taxable income for any 
other losses, a built-in loss allowed under this section in the year it 
arises is taken into account.
    (ii) Losses treated as arising in SRLYs. If a net operating loss 
carryover or carryback did not arise in a SRLY but is attributable to a 
built-in loss (as defined under Sec. 1.1502-15), the carryover or 
carryback is treated for purposes of this paragraph (c) as arising in a 
SRLY if the built-in loss was not allowed, after application of the SRLY 
limitation, in the year it arose. For an illustration, see Sec. 1.1502-
15(d), Example 5. But see Sec. 1.1502-15(g)(1).
    (iii) Examples. The principles of this paragraph (c)(1) are 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. Determination of SRLY limitation. (i) Individual A owns 
P. In Year 1, Individual A forms T, and T sustains a $100 net operating 
loss that is carried forward. P acquires all the stock of T at the 
beginning of Year 2, and T becomes a member of the P group. The P group 
has $300 of consolidated taxable income in Year 2 (computed without 
regard to the CNOL deduction). Such consolidated taxable income would be 
$70 if determined by reference to only T's items.
    (ii) T's $100 net operating loss carryover from Year 1 arose in a 
SRLY. See Sec. 1.1502-1(f)(2)(iii). P's acquisition of T was not an 
ownership change as defined by section 382(g). Thus, the $100 net 
operating loss carryover is subject to the SRLY limitation in paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section. The SRLY limitation for Year 2 is consolidated 
taxable income determined by reference to only T's items, or $70. Thus, 
$70 of the loss is included under paragraph (a) of this section in the P 
group's CNOL deduction for Year 2.
    (iii) The facts are the same as in paragraph (i) of this Example 1, 
except that such consolidated taxable income (computed without regard to 
the CNOL deduction and by reference to only T's items) for Year 2 is a 
loss (a CNOL) of $370. Because the SRLY limitation may not exceed the 
consolidated taxable income determined by reference to only T's items, 
and such items aggregate to a CNOL, T's $100 net operating loss 
carryover from Year 1 is not allowed under the SRLY limitation in Year 
2. Moreover, if consolidated taxable income (computed without regard to 
the CNOL deduction and by reference to only T's items) did not exceed 
$370 in Year 3, the carryover would still be restricted under paragraph 
(c) of this section in Year 3, because the aggregate consolidated 
taxable income for all consolidated return years of the group computed 
by reference to only T's items would not be a positive amount.

[[Page 350]]

    Example 2. Net operating loss carryovers. (i) In Year 1, Individual 
A forms P, and P sustains a $40 net operating loss that is carried 
forward. P has no income in Year 2. Individual A also owns T which 
sustains a net operating loss of $50 in Year 2 that is carried forward. 
P acquires the stock of T from Individual A during Year 3, but T is not 
a member of the P group for each day of the year. P and T file separate 
returns and sustain net operating losses of $120 and $60, respectively, 
for Year 3. The P group files consolidated returns beginning in Year 4. 
During Year 4, the P group has $160 of consolidated taxable income 
(computed without regard to the CNOL deduction). Such consolidated 
taxable income would be $70 if determined by reference to only T's 
items. These results are summarized as follows:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) P's Year 1, Year 2, and Year 3 are not SRLYs with respect to 
the P group. See Sec. 1.1502-1(f)(2)(i). Thus, P's $40 net operating 
loss arising in Year 1 and $120 net operating loss arising in Year 3 are 
not subject to the SRLY limitation under paragraph (c) of this section. 
Under the principles of section 172, paragraph (b) of this section 
requires that the loss arising in Year 1 be the first loss absorbed by 
the P group in Year 4. Absorption of this loss leaves $120 of the 
group's consolidated taxable income available for offset by other loss 
carryovers.
    (iii) T's Year 2 and Year 3 are SRLYs with respect to the P group. 
See Sec. 1.1502-1(f)(2)(ii). P's acquisition of T was not an ownership 
change as defined by section 382(g). Thus, T's $50 net operating loss 
arising in Year 2 and $60 net operating loss arising in Year 3 are 
subject to the SRLY limitation. Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, 
the SRLY limitation for Year 4 is $70, and under paragraph (b) of this 
section, T's $50 loss from Year 2 must be included under paragraph (a) 
of this section in the P group's CNOL deduction for Year 4. The 
absorption of this loss leaves $70 of the group's consolidated taxable 
income available for offset by other loss carryovers.
    (iv) P and T each carry over net operating losses to Year 4 from a 
taxable year ending on the same date (Year 3). The losses carried over 
from Year 3 total $180. Under paragraph (b) of this section, the losses 
carried over from Year 3 are absorbed on a pro rata basis, even though 
one arises in a SRLY and the other does not. However, the group cannot 
absorb more than $20 of T's $60 net operating loss arising in Year 3 
because its $70 SRLY limitation for Year 4 is reduced by T's $50 Year 2 
SRLY loss already included in the CNOL deduction for Year 4. Thus, the 
absorption of Year 3 losses is as follows:
    Amount of P's Year 3 losses absorbed = $120/($120 + $20) x $70 = 
$60.
    Amount of T's Year 3 losses absorbed = $20/($120 + $20) x $70 = $10.
    (v) The absorption of $10 of T's Year 3 loss further reduces T's 
SRLY limitation to $10 ($70 of initial SRLY limitation, reduced by the 
$60 net operating loss already included in the CNOL deductions for Year 
4 under paragraph (a) of this section).
    (vi) P carries its remaining $60 Year 3 net operating loss and T 
carries its remaining $50 Year 3 net operating loss over to Year 5. 
Assume that, in Year 5, the P group has $90 of consolidated taxable 
income (computed without regard to the CNOL deduction). The group's CTI 
determined by reference to only T's items is a CNOL of $4. For Year 5, 
the CNOL deduction is $66, which includes $60 of P's Year 3 loss and $6 
of T's Year 3 loss (the aggregate consolidated taxable income for Years 
4 and 5 determined by reference to T's items, or $66, reduced by T's 
SRLY losses actually absorbed by the group in Year 4, or $60).
    Example 3. Net operating loss carrybacks. (i) P owns all of the 
stock of S and T. The members of the P group contribute the following to 
the consolidated taxable income of the P group for Years 1, 2, and 3:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                      Year 1          Year 2          Year 3           Total
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
P...............................................            $100             $60             $80            $240
S...............................................              20              20              30              70
T...............................................              30              10            (50)            (10)
CTI.............................................             150              90              60             300
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


[[Page 351]]

    (ii) P sells all of the stock of T to Individual A at the beginning 
of Year 4. For its Year 4 separate return year, T has a net operating 
loss of $30.
    (iii) T's Year 4 is a SRLY with respect to the P group. See Sec. 
1.1502-1(f)(1). T's $30 net operating loss carryback to the P group from 
Year 4 is not allowed under paragraph (c) of this section to be included 
in the CNOL deduction under paragraph (a) of this section for Year 1, 2, 
or 3, because the P group's consolidated taxable income would not be a 
positive amount if determined by reference to only T's items for all 
consolidated return years through Year 4 (without regard to the $30 net 
operating loss). The $30 loss is carried forward to T's Year 5 and 
succeeding taxable years as provided under the Internal Revenue Code.
    Example 4. Computation of SRLY limitation for built-in losses 
treated as net operating loss carryovers. (i) Individual A owns P. In 
Year 1, Individual A forms T by contributing $300 and T sustains a $100 
net operating loss. During Year 2, T's assets decline in value by $100. 
At the beginning of Year 3, P acquires all the stock of T from 
Individual A, and T becomes a member of the P group in a transaction 
that does not result in an ownership change under section 382(g). At the 
time of the acquisition, T has a $100 net unrealized built-in loss, 
which exceeds the threshold requirements of section 382(h)(3)(B). During 
Year 3, T recognizes its unrealized loss as a $100 ordinary loss. The 
members of the P group contribute the following to the consolidated 
taxable income of the P group for Years 3 and 4 (computed without regard 
to T's recognition of its unrealized loss and any CNOL deduction under 
this section):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                Year 3   Year 4   Total
------------------------------------------------------------------------
P group (without T)..........................     $100     $100     $200
T............................................       60       40      100
CTI..........................................      160      140      300
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) Under Sec. 1.1502-15(a), T's $100 of ordinary loss in Year 3 
constitutes a built-in loss that is subject to the SRLY limitation under 
paragraph (c) of this section. The amount of the limitation is 
determined by treating the deduction as a net operating loss carryover 
from a SRLY. The built-in loss is therefore subject to a $60 SRLY 
limitation for Year 3. The built-in loss is treated as a net operating 
loss carryover solely for purposes of determining the extent to which 
the loss is not allowed by reason of the SRLY limitation, and for all 
other purposes the loss remains a loss arising in Year 3. Consequently, 
under paragraph (b) of this section, the $60 allowed under the SRLY 
limitation is absorbed by the P group before T's $100 net operating loss 
carryover from Year 1 is allowed.
    (iii) Under Sec. 1.1502-15(a), the $40 balance of the built-in loss 
that is not allowed in Year 3 because of the SRLY limitation is treated 
as a $40 net operating loss arising in Year 3 that is subject to the 
SRLY limitation because, under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, 
Year 3 is treated as a SRLY, and is carried to other years in accordance 
with the rules of paragraph (b) of this section. The SRLY limitation for 
Year 4 is the P group's consolidated taxable income for Year 3 and Year 
4 determined by reference to only T's items and without regard to the 
group's CNOL deductions ($60 + $40), reduced by T's loss actually 
absorbed by the group in Year 3 ($60). The SRLY limitation for Year 4 is 
$40.
    (iv) Under paragraph (c) of this section and the principles of 
section 172(b), $40 of T's $100 net operating loss carryover from Year 1 
is included in the CNOL deduction under paragraph (a) of this section in 
Year 4.
    Example 5. Dual SRLY registers and accounting for SRLY losses 
actually absorbed. (i) In Year 1, T sustains a $100 net operating loss 
and a $50 net capital loss. At the beginning of Year 2, T becomes a 
member of the P group in a transaction that does not result in an 
ownership change under section 382(g). Both of T's carryovers from Year 
1 are subject to SRLY limits under this paragraph (c) and Sec. 1.1502-
22(c). The members of the P group contribute the following to the 
consolidated taxable income for Years 2 and 3 (computed without regard 
to T's CNOL deduction under this section or net capital loss carryover 
under Sec. 1.1502-22):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                           P        T
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              Year 1 (SRLY)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ordinary..............................................  .......    (100)
Capital...............................................  .......    (50)
                                 Year 2
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ordinary..............................................       30       60
Capital...............................................        0    (20)
                                 Year 3
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ordinary..............................................       10       40
Capital...............................................        0       30
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) For Year 2, the group computes separate SRLY limits for each of 
T's SRLY carryovers from Year 1. The group determines its ability to use 
its capital loss carryover before it determines its ability to use its 
ordinary loss carryover. Under section 1212, because the group has no 
Year 2 capital gain, it cannot absorb any capital losses in Year 2. T's 
Year 1 net capital loss and the group's Year 2 consolidated net capital 
loss (all of which is attributable to T) are carried over to Year 3.
    (iii) Under this section, the aggregate amount of T's $100 net 
operating loss carryover from Year 1 that may be included in the CNOL 
deduction of the group for Year 2 may not exceed $60--the amount of the 
consolidated taxable income computed by reference only to T's items, 
including losses and deductions to the extent actually absorbed

[[Page 352]]

(i.e., $60 of T's ordinary income for Year 2). Thus, the group may 
include $60 of T's ordinary loss carryover from Year 1 in its Year 2 
CNOL deduction. T carries over its remaining $40 of its Year 1 loss to 
Year 3.
    (iv) For Year 3, the group again computes separate SRLY limits for 
each of T's SRLY carryovers from Year 1. The group has consolidated net 
capital gain (without taking into account a net capital loss carryover 
deduction) of $30. Under Sec. 1.1502-22(c), the aggregate amount of T's 
$50 capital loss carryover from Year 1 that may be included in computing 
the group's consolidated net capital gain for all years of the group 
(here Years 2 and 3) may not exceed $30 (the aggregate consolidated net 
capital gain computed by reference only to T's items, including losses 
and deductions actually absorbed (i.e., $30 of capital gain in Year 3)). 
Thus, the group may include $30 of T's Year 1 capital loss carryover in 
its computation of consolidated net capital gain for Year 3, which 
offsets the group's capital gains for Year 3. T carries over its 
remaining $20 of its Year 1 loss to Year 4. The group carries over the 
Year 2 consolidated net capital loss to Year 4.
    (v) Under this section, the aggregate amount of T's net operating 
loss carryover from Year 1 that may be included in the CNOL deduction of 
the group for Years 2 and 3 may not exceed $100, which is the amount of 
the aggregate consolidated taxable income for Years 2 and 3 determined 
by reference only to T's items, including losses and deductions actually 
absorbed (i.e., $60 of ordinary income in Year 2 plus $40 of ordinary 
income, $30 of capital gain, and $30 of SRLY capital losses actually 
absorbed in Year 3). The group included $60 of T's ordinary loss 
carryover in its Year 2 CNOL deduction. It may include the remaining $40 
of the carryover in its Year 3 CNOL deduction.

    (2) SRLY subgroup limitation. In the case of a net operating loss 
carryover or carryback for which there is a SRLY subgroup, the 
principles of paragraph (c)(1) of this section apply to the SRLY 
subgroup, and not separately to its members. Thus, the contribution to 
consolidated taxable income and the net operating loss carryovers and 
carrybacks arising (or treated as arising) in SRLYs that are included in 
the CNOL deductions for all consolidated return years of the group under 
paragraph (a) of this section are based on the aggregate amounts of 
income, gain, deduction, and loss of the members of the SRLY subgroup 
for the relevant consolidated return years (as provided in paragraph 
(c)(1)(i)(C) of this section). For an illustration of aggregate amounts 
during the relevant consolidated return years following the year in 
which a member of a SRLY subgroup ceases to be a member of the group, 
see paragraph (c)(2)(viii) Example 4 of this section. A SRLY subgroup 
may exist only for a carryover or carryback arising in a year that is 
not a SRLY (and is not treated as a SRLY under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of 
this section) with respect to another group (the former group), whether 
or not the group is a consolidated group, or for a carryover that was 
subject to the overlap rule described in paragraph (g) of this section 
or Sec. 1.1502-15(g) with respect to another group (the former group). 
A separate SRLY subgroup is determined for each such carryover or 
carryback. A consolidated group may include more than one SRLY subgroup, 
and a member may be a member of more than one SRLY subgroup. Solely for 
purposes of determining the members of a SRLY subgroup with respect to a 
loss:
    (i) Carryovers. In the case of a carryover, the SRLY subgroup is 
composed of the member carrying over the loss (the loss member) and each 
other member that was a member of the former group that becomes a member 
of the group at the same time as the loss member. A member remains a 
member of the SRLY subgroup until it ceases to be affiliated with the 
loss member. The aggregate determination described in paragraph (c)(1) 
of this section and this paragraph (c)(2) includes the amounts of 
income, gain, deduction, and loss of each member of the SRLY subgroup 
for the consolidated return years during which it remains a member of 
the SRLY subgroup. For an illustration of the aggregate determination of 
a SRLY subgroup, see paragraph (c)(2)(viii) Example 2 of this section.
    (ii) Carrybacks. In the case of a carryback, the SRLY subgroup is 
composed of the member carrying back the loss (the loss member) and each 
other member of the group from which the loss is carried back that has 
been continuously affiliated with the loss member from the year to which 
the loss is carried through the year in which the loss arises.
    (iii) Built-in losses. In the case of a built-in loss, the SRLY 
subgroup is composed of the member recognizing

[[Page 353]]

the loss (the loss member) and each other member that was part of the 
subgroup with respect to the loss determined under Sec. 1.1502-15(c)(2) 
immediately before the members became members of the group. The 
principles of paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section apply to 
determine the SRLY subgroup for the built-in loss that is, under 
paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, treated as arising in a SRLY with 
respect to the group in which the loss is recognized. For this purpose 
and as the context requires, a reference in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and 
(ii) of this section to a group or former group is a reference to the 
subgroup determined under Sec. 1.1502-15(c)(2).
    (iv) Principal purpose of avoiding or increasing a SRLY limitation. 
The members composing a SRLY subgroup are not treated as a SRLY subgroup 
if any of them is formed, acquired, or availed of with a principal 
purpose of avoiding the application of, or increasing any limitation 
under, this paragraph (c). Any member excluded from a SRLY subgroup, if 
excluded with a principal purpose of so avoiding or increasing any SRLY 
limitation, is treated as included in the SRLY subgroup.
    (v) Coordination with other limitations. This paragraph (c)(2) does 
not allow a net operating loss to offset income to the extent 
inconsistent with other limitations or restrictions on the use of 
losses, such as a limitation based on the nature or activities of 
members. For example, any dual consolidated loss may not reduce the 
taxable income to an extent greater than that allowed under section 
1503(d) and Sec. 1.1503-2. See also Sec. 1.1502-47(q) (relating to 
preemption of rules for life-nonlife groups).
    (vi) Anti-duplication. If the same item of income or deduction could 
be taken into account more than once in determining a limitation under 
this paragraph (c), or in a manner inconsistent with any other provision 
of the Internal Revenue Code or regulations incorporating this paragraph 
(c), the item of income or deduction is taken into account only once and 
in such manner that losses are absorbed in accordance with the ordering 
rules in paragraph (b) of this section and the underlying purposes of 
this section.
    (vii) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1502-
21T(c)(2)(vii).
    (viii) Examples. The principles of this paragraph (c)(2) are 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. Members of SRLY subgroups. (i) Individual A owns all of 
the stock of P, S, T and M. P and M are each the common parent of a 
consolidated group. During Year 1, P sustains a $50 net operating loss. 
At the beginning of Year 2, P acquires all the stock of S at a time when 
the aggregate basis of S's assets exceeds their aggregate value by $70, 
and S becomes a member of the P group. At the beginning of Year 3, P 
acquires all the stock of T, T has a $60 net operating loss carryover at 
the time of the acquisition, and T becomes a member of the P group. 
During Year 4, S forms S1 and T forms T1, each by contributing assets 
with built-in gains which are, in the aggregate, material. S1 and T1 
become members of the P group. During Year 7, M acquires all of the 
stock of P, and the members of the P group become members of the M group 
for the balance of Year 7. The $50 and $60 loss carryovers of P and T 
are carried to Year 7 of the M group, and the value and basis of S's 
assets did not change after it became a member of the former P group. 
None of the transactions described above resulted in an ownership change 
under section 382(g).
    (ii) Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a separate SRLY 
subgroup is determined for each loss carryover and built-in loss. In the 
P group, P's $50 loss carryover is not treated as arising in a SRLY. See 
Sec. 1.1502-1(f). Consequently, the carryover is not subject to 
limitation under paragraph (c) of this section in the P group.
    (iii) In the M group, P's $50 loss carryover is treated as arising 
in a SRLY and is subject to the limitation under paragraph (c) of this 
section. A SRLY subgroup with respect to that loss is composed of 
members which were members of the P group, the group as to which the 
loss was not a SRLY. The SRLY subgroup is composed of P, the member 
carrying over the loss, and each other member of the P group that became 
a member of the M group at the same time as P. A member of the SRLY 
subgroup remains a member until it ceases to be affiliated with P. For 
Year 7, the SRLY subgroup is composed of P, S, T, S1, and T1.
    (iv) In the P group, S's $70 unrealized loss, if recognized within 
the 5-year recognition period after S becomes a member of the P group, 
is subject to limitation under paragraph (c) of this section. See Sec. 
1.1502-15 and paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. Because S was not 
continuously affiliated with P, T, or T1 for 60 consecutive months prior 
to joining the P group, these corporations cannot be included in a SRLY 
subgroup with respect to

[[Page 354]]

S's unrealized loss in the P group. See paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this 
section. As a successor to S, S1 is included in a subgroup with S in the 
P group, and, because 100 percent of S1's stock is owned directly by 
corporations that were members of the SRLY subgroup when the members of 
the SRLY subgroup became members of the P group, its net positive income 
is not excluded from the consolidated taxable income of the P group that 
may be offset by the built-in loss. See paragraph (f) of this section.
    (v) In the M group, S's $70 unrealized loss, if recognized within 
the 5-year recognition period after S becomes a member of the M group, 
is subject to limitation under paragraph (c) of this section. Prior to 
becoming a member of the M group, S had been continuously affiliated 
with P (but not T or T1) for 60 consecutive months, and S1 is a 
successor that has remained continuously affiliated with S. Those 
members had a net unrealized built-in loss immediately before they 
became members of the group under Sec. 1.1502-15(c). Consequently, in 
Year 7, S, S1, and P compose a subgroup in the M group with respect to 
S's unrealized loss. Because S1 was a member of the SRLY subgroup when 
it became a member of the M group and also because 100 percent of S1's 
stock is owned directly by corporations that were members of the SRLY 
subgroup when the members of the SRLY subgroup became members of the M 
group, its net positive income is not excluded from the consolidated 
taxable income of the M group that may be offset by the recognized 
built-in loss. See paragraph (f) of this section.
    (vi) In the P group, T's $60 loss carryover arose in a SRLY and is 
subject to limitation under paragraph (c) of this section. P, S, and S1 
were not members of the group in which T's loss arose, and T's loss 
carryover was not subject to the overlap rule described in paragraph (g) 
of this section with respect to the P group (the former group). Thus, P, 
S, and S1 are not members of a SRLY subgroup with respect to the T 
carryover in the P group. See paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. As a 
successor to T, T1 is included in a SRLY subgroup with T in the P group, 
and, because 100 percent of T1's stock is owned directly by corporations 
that were members of the SRLY subgroup when the members of the SRLY 
subgroup became members of the P group, its net positive income is not 
excluded from the consolidated taxable income of the P group that may be 
offset by the carryover. See paragraph (f) of this section.
    (vii) In the M group, T's $60 loss carryover arose in a SRLY and is 
subject to limitation under paragraph (c) of this section. T and T1 
remain the only members of a SRLY subgroup with respect to the 
carryover. Because T1 was a member of the SRLY subgroup when it became a 
member of the M group and also because 100 percent of T1's stock is 
owned directly by corporations that were members of the SRLY subgroup 
when the members of the SRLY subgroup became members of the M group, its 
net positive income is not excluded from the consolidated taxable income 
of the M group that may be offset by the carryover. See paragraph (f) of 
this section.
    Example 2. Computation of SRLY subgroup limitation. (i) Individual A 
owns all of the stock of S, T, P and M. P and M are each the common 
parent of a consolidated group. In Year 2, P acquires all the stock of S 
and T from Individual A, and S and T become members of the P group. For 
Year 3, the P group has a $45 CNOL, which is attributable to P, and 
which P carries forward. M is the common parent of another group. At the 
beginning of Year 4, M acquires all of the stock of P, and the former 
members of the P group become members of the M group. None of the 
transactions described above resulted in an ownership change under 
section 382(g).
    (ii) P's year to which the loss is attributable, Year 3, is a SRLY 
with respect to the M group. See Sec. 1.1502-1(f)(1). However, P, S, 
and T compose a SRLY subgroup with respect to the Year 3 loss under 
paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section because Year 3 is not a SRLY (and is 
not treated as a SRLY) with respect to the P group. P's loss is carried 
over to the M group's Year 4 and is therefore subject to the SRLY 
subgroup limitation in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
    (iii) In Year 4, the M group has $10 of consolidated taxable income 
(computed without regard to the CNOL deduction for Year 4). Such 
consolidated taxable income would be $45 if determined by reference to 
only the items of P, S, and T, the members included in the SRLY subgroup 
with respect to P's loss carryover. Therefore, the SRLY subgroup 
limitation under paragraph (c)(2) of this section for P's net operating 
loss carryover from Year 3 is $45. Because the M group has only $10 of 
consolidated taxable income in Year 4, however, only $10 of P's net 
operating loss carryover is included in the CNOL deduction under 
paragraph (a) of this section in Year 4.
    (iv) In Year 5, the M group has $100 of consolidated taxable income 
(computed without regard to the CNOL deduction for Year 5). Neither P, 
S, nor T has any items of income, gain, deduction, or loss in Year 5. 
Although the members of the SRLY subgroup do not contribute to the $100 
of consolidated taxable income in Year 5, the SRLY subgroup limitation 
for Year 5 is $35 (the sum of SRLY subgroup consolidated taxable income 
of $45 in Year 4 and $0 in Year 5, less the $10 net operating loss 
carryover actually absorbed by the M group in Year 4). Therefore, $35 of 
P's net operating loss carryover is included in the CNOL deduction under 
paragraph (a) of this section in Year 5.

[[Page 355]]

    Example 3. Inclusion in more than one SRLY subgroup. (i) Individual 
A owns all of the stock of S, T, P and M. S, P, and M are each the 
common parent of a consolidated group. At the beginning of Year 1, S 
acquires all the stock of T from Individual A, and T becomes a member of 
the S group. For Year 1, the S group has a CNOL of $10, all of which is 
attributable to S and is carried over to Year 2. At the beginning of 
Year 2, P acquires all the stock of S, and S and T become members of the 
P group. For Year 2, the P group has a CNOL of $35, all of which is 
attributable to P and is carried over to Year 3. At the beginning of 
Year 3, M acquires all of the stock of P, and the former members of the 
P group become members of the M group. None of the transactions 
described above resulted in an ownership change under section 382(g).
    (ii) P's and S's net operating losses arising in SRLYs with respect 
to the M group are subject to limitation under paragraph (c) of this 
section. P, S, and T compose a SRLY subgroup for purposes of determining 
the limitation for P's $35 net operating loss carryover arising in Year 
2 because, under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, Year 2 is not a 
SRLY with respect to the P group. Similarly, S and T compose a SRLY 
subgroup for purposes of determining the limitation for S's $10 net 
operating loss carryover arising in Year 1 because Year 1 is not a SRLY 
with respect to the S group.
    (iii) S and T are members of both the SRLY subgroup with respect to 
P's losses and the SRLY subgroup with respect to S's losses. Under 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section, S's and T's items cannot be included 
in the determination of the SRLY subgroup limitation for both SRLY 
subgroups for the same consolidated return year; paragraph (c)(2)(vi) of 
this section requires the M group to consider the items of S and T only 
once so that the losses are absorbed in the order of the taxable years 
in which they were sustained. Because S's loss was incurred in Year 1, 
while P's loss was incurred in Year 2, the items will be added in the 
determination of the consolidated taxable income of the S and T SRLY 
subgroup to enable S's loss to be absorbed first. The taxable income of 
the P, S, and T SRLY subgroup is then computed by including the 
consolidated taxable income for the S and T SRLY subgroup less the 
amount of any net operating loss carryover of S that is absorbed after 
applying this section to the S subgroup for the year.
    Example 4. Corporation ceases to be affiliated with a SRLY subgroup. 
(i) Individual A owns all of the stock of P, and M. P and S are members 
of the P group and the P group has a CNOL of $30 in Year 1, all of which 
is attributable to P and carried over to Year 2. At the beginning of 
Year 2, M acquires all of the stock of P, and P and S become members of 
the M group. P and S compose a SRLY subgroup with respect to P's net 
operating loss carryover. For Year 2, consolidated taxable income of the 
M group determined by reference to only the items of P (and without 
regard to the CNOL deduction for Year 2) is $40. However, such 
consolidated taxable income of the M group determined by reference to 
the items of both P and S is a loss of $20. Thus, the SRLY subgroup 
limitation under paragraph (c)(2) of this section prevents the M group 
from including any of P's net operating loss carryover in the CNOL 
deduction under paragraph (a) of this section in Year 2, and P carries 
the Year 1 loss to Year 3.
    (ii) At the end of Year 2, P sells all of the S stock, and S ceases 
to be a member of the M group and the P subgroup. For Year 3, 
consolidated taxable income of the M group is $50 (determined without 
regard to the CNOL deduction for Year 3), and such consolidated taxable 
income would be $10 if determined by reference to only items of P. 
However, the limitation under paragraph (c) of this section for Year 3 
for P's net operating loss carryover still prevents the M group from 
including any of P's loss in the CNOL deduction under paragraph (a) of 
this section. The limitation results from the inclusion of S's items for 
Year 2 in the determination of the SRLY subgroup limitation for Year 3 
even though S ceased to be a member of the M group (and the P subgroup) 
at the end of Year 2. Thus, the M group's consolidated taxable income 
determined by reference to only the SRLY subgroup members' items for all 
consolidated return years of the group through Year 3 (determined 
without regard to the CNOL deduction) is not a positive amount.

    (ix) Application to other than loss carryovers. Paragraph (g) of 
this section and the phrase ``or for a carryover that was subject to the 
overlap rule described in paragraph (g) of this section or Sec. 1.1502-
15(g) with respect to another group (the former group)'' in this 
paragraph (c)(2) apply only to carryovers of net operating losses, net 
capital losses, and for taxable years for which the due date (without 
extensions) of the consolidated return is after May 25, 2000, to 
carryovers of credits described in section 383(a)(2). Accordingly, as 
the context may require, if another regulation references this section 
and such other regulation does not concern a carryover of net operating 
losses, net capital losses, or for taxable years for which the due date 
(without extensions) of the consolidated return is after May 25, 2000, 
carryovers of credits described in section 383(a)(2), then such 
reference does not include a reference to such paragraph or phrase.

    (d) Coordination with consolidated return change of ownership 
limitation and transactions subject to old section 382--(1) Consolidated 
return changes of ownership. If a consolidated return change of 
ownership occurred before January 1, 1997, the principles of Sec. 
1.1502-21A(d) apply to determine the amount of the aggregate of the net 
operating losses attributable to old members of the group that may be 
included in the consolidated net operating loss deduction under 
paragraph (a) of this section. For this purpose, Sec. 1.1502-1(g) is 
applied by treating that date as the end of the year of change.
    (2) Old section 382. The principles of Sec. 1.1502-21A(e) apply to 
disallow or reduce the amount of a net operating loss carryover of a 
member as a result of a transaction subject to old section 382.
    (e) Consolidated net operating loss. Any excess of deductions over 
gross income, as determined under Sec. 1.1502-11(a) (without regard to 
any consolidated net operating loss deduction), is also referred to as 
the consolidated net operating loss (or CNOL).
    (f) Predecessors and successors--(1) In general. For purposes of 
this section, any reference to a corporation, member, common parent, or 
subsidiary, includes, as the context may require, a reference to a 
successor or predecessor, as defined in Sec. 1.1502-1(f)(4).
    (2) Limitation on SRLY subgroups--(i) General rule. Except as 
provided in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, if a successor's items 
of income and gain exceed the successor's items of deduction and loss 
(net positive income), then the net positive income attributable to the 
successor is excluded from the computation of the consolidated taxable 
income of a SRLY subgroup.
    (ii) Exceptions. A successor's net positive income is not excluded 
from the consolidated taxable income of a SRLY subgroup if--
    (A) The successor acquires substantially all the assets and 
liabilities of its predecessor, and the predecessor ceases to exist;
    (B) The successor was a member of the SRLY subgroup when the SRLY 
subgroup members became members of the group;
    (C) 100 percent of the stock of the successor is owned directly by 
corporations that were members of the SRLY subgroup when the SRLY 
subgroup members became members of the group; or
    (D) The Commissioner so determines.
    (g) Overlap with section 382--(1) General rule. The limitation 
provided in paragraph (c) of this section does not apply to net 
operating loss carryovers (other than a hypothetical carryover described 
in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(D) of this section and a carryover described in 
paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section) when the application of paragraph 
(c) of this section results in an overlap with the application of 
section 382. For a similar rule applying in the case of net operating 
loss carryovers described in paragraphs (c)(1)(i)(D) and (c)(1)(ii) of 
this section, see Sec. 1.1502-15(g).
    (2) Definitions--(i) Generally. For purposes of this paragraph (g), 
the definitions and nomenclature contained in section 382, the 
regulations thereunder, and Sec. Sec. 1.1502-90 through 1.1502-99 
apply.
    (ii) Overlap. (A) An overlap of the application of paragraph (c) of 
this section and the application of section 382 with respect to a net 
operating loss carryover occurs if a corporation becomes a member of a 
consolidated group (the SRLY event) within six months of the change date 
of an ownership change giving rise to a section 382(a) limitation with 
respect to that carryover (the section 382 event).
    (B) If an overlap described in paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(A) of this 
section occurs with respect to net operating loss carryovers of a 
corporation whose SRLY event occurs within the six month period 
beginning on the date of a section 382 event, then an overlap is treated 
as also occurring with respect to that corporation's net operating loss 
carryover that arises within the period beginning with the section 382 
event and ending with the SRLY event.
    (C) For special rules in the event that there is a SRLY subgroup 
and/or a loss subgroup as defined in Sec. 1.1502-91(d)(1) with respect 
to a carryover, see paragraph (g)(4) of this section.
    (3) Operating rules--(i) Section 382 event before SRLY event. If a 
SRLY event occurs on the same date as a section 382 event or within the 
six month

[[Page 357]]

period beginning on the date of the section 382 event, paragraph (g)(1) 
of this section applies beginning with the tax year that includes the 
SRLY event.
    (ii) SRLY event before section 382 event. If a section 382 event 
occurs within the period beginning the day after the SRLY event and 
ending six months after the SRLY event, paragraph (g)(1) of this section 
applies starting with the first tax year that begins after the section 
382 event.
    (4) Subgroup rules. In general, in the case of a net operating loss 
carryover for which there is a SRLY subgroup and a loss subgroup (as 
defined in Sec. 1.1502-91(d)(1)), the principles of this paragraph (g) 
apply to the SRLY subgroup, and not separately to its members. However, 
paragraph (g)(1) of this section applies--
    (i) With respect to a carryover described in paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(A) 
of this section only if--
    (A) All members of the SRLY subgroup with respect to that carryover 
are also included in a loss subgroup with respect to that carryover; and
    (B) All members of a loss subgroup with respect to that carryover 
are also members of a SRLY subgroup with respect to that carryover; and
    (ii) With respect to a carryover described in paragraph 
(g)(2)(ii)(B) of this section only if all members of the SRLY subgroup 
for that carryover are also members of a SRLY subgroup that has net 
operating loss carryovers described in paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(A) of this 
section that are subject to the overlap rule of paragraph (g)(1) of this 
section.
    (5) Examples. The principles of this paragraph (g) are illustrated 
by the following examples:

    Example 1. Overlap--Simultaneous Acquisition. (i) Individual A owns 
all of the stock of P, which in turn owns all of the stock of S. P and S 
file a consolidated return. In Year 2, B, an individual unrelated to 
Individual A, forms T which incurs a $100 net operating loss for that 
year. At the beginning of Year 3, S acquires T.
    (ii) S's acquisition of T results in T becoming a member of the P 
group (the SRLY event) and also results in an ownership change of T, 
within the meaning of section 382(g), that gives rise to a limitation 
under section 382(a) (the section 382 event) with respect to the T 
carryover.
    (iii) Because the SRLY event and the change date of the section 382 
event occur on the same date, there is an overlap of the application of 
the SRLY rules and the application of section 382.
    (iv) Consequently, under this paragraph (g), in Year 3 the SRLY 
limitation does not apply to the Year 2 $100 net operating loss.
    Example 2. Overlap--Section 382 event before SRLY event. (i) 
Individual A owns all of the stock of P, which in turn owns all of the 
stock of S. P and S file a consolidated return. In Year 1, B, an 
individual unrelated to Individual A, forms T which incurs a $100 net 
operating loss for that year. On February 28 of Year 2, S purchases 55% 
of T from Individual B. On June 30, of Year 2, S purchases an additional 
35% of T from Individual B.
    (ii) The February 28 purchase of 55% of T is a section 382 event 
because it results in an ownership change of T, under section 382(g), 
that gives rise to a section 382(a) limitation with respect to the T 
carryover. The June 30 purchase of 35% of T results in T becoming a 
member of the P group and is therefore a SRLY event.
    (iii) Because the SRLY event occurred within six months of the 
change date of the section 382 event, there is an overlap of the 
application of the SRLY rules and the application of section 382.
    (iv) Consequently, under paragraph (g) of this section, in Year 2 
the SRLY limitation does not apply to the Year 1 $100 net operating 
loss.
    Example 3. No overlap--Section 382 event before SRLY event. (i) The 
facts are the same as in Example 2 except that Individual B does not 
sell the additional 35% of T to S until September 30, Year 2.
    (ii) The February 28 purchase of 55% of T is a section 382 event 
because it results in an ownership change of T, under section 382(g), 
that gives rise to a section 382(a) limitation with respect to the T 
carryover. The September 30 purchase of 35% of T results in T becoming a 
member of the P group and is therefore a SRLY event.
    (iii) Because the SRLY event did not occur within six months of the 
change date of the section 382 event, there is no overlap of the 
application of the SRLY rules and the application of section 382. 
Consequently, the Year 1 net operating loss is subject to a SRLY 
limitation and a section 382 limitation.
    Example 4. Overlap--SRLY event before section 382 event. (i) P and S 
file a consolidated return. S has owned 40% of T for 6 years. For Year 
6, T has a net operating loss of $500 that is carried forward. On March 
31, Year 7, S acquires an additional 40% of T, and on August 31, Year 7, 
S acquires the remaining 20% of T.
    (ii) The March 31 purchase of 40% of T results in T becoming a 
member of the P group and is therefore a SRLY event. The August 31 
purchase of 20% of T is a section 382 event because it results in an 
ownership change of T, under section 382(g), that gives rise to a

[[Page 358]]

section 382(a) limitation with respect to the T carryover.
    (iii) Because the SRLY event occurred within six months of the 
change date of the section 382 event, there is an overlap of the 
application of the SRLY rules and the application of section 382 within 
the meaning of this paragraph (g).
    (iv) Under this paragraph (g), the SRLY rules of paragraph (c) of 
this section will apply to the Year 7 tax year. Beginning in Year 8 (the 
year after the section 382 event), any unabsorbed portion of the Year 6 
net operating loss will not be subject to a SRLY limitation.
    Example 5. Overlap--Coextensive subgroups. (i) Individual A owns all 
of the stock of S, which in turn owns all of the stock of T. S and T 
file a consolidated return beginning in Year 1. B, an individual 
unrelated to Individual A, owns all of the stock of P, the common parent 
of a consolidated group. In Year 2, the S group has a $200 consolidated 
net operating loss which is carried forward, of which $100 is 
attributable to S, and $100 is attributable to T. At the beginning of 
Year 3, the P group acquires all of the stock of S from Individual A.
    (ii) P's acquisition of S results in S and T becoming members of the 
P group (the SRLY event). With respect to the Year 2 net operating loss 
carryover, S and T compose a SRLY subgroup under paragraph (c)(2) of 
this section.
    (iii) S and T also compose a loss subgroup under Sec. 1.1502-
91(d)(1) with respect to the Year 2 net operating loss carryover. P's 
acquisition also results in an ownership change of S, the subgroup 
parent, within the meaning of section 382(g), that gives rise to a 
limitation under section 382(a) (the section 382 event) with respect to 
the Year 2 carryover.
    (iv) Because the SRLY event and the change date of the section 382 
event occur on the same date, there is an overlap of the application of 
the SRLY rules and the application of section 382 within the meaning of 
paragraph (g) of this section. Because the SRLY subgroup and the loss 
subgroup are coextensive, under paragraph (g) of this section, the SRLY 
limitation does not apply to the Year 2 $200 net operating loss.
    Example 6. No overlap--Different subgroups. (i) Individual B owns 
all of the stock of P, the common parent of a consolidated group. P owns 
all of the stock of S and all of the stock of T. Individual A owns all 
of the stock of X, the common parent of another consolidated group. In 
Year 1, the P group has a $200 consolidated net operating loss, of which 
$100 is attributable to S and $100 is attributable to T. At the 
beginning of Year 3, the X group acquires all of the stock of S and T 
from P and does not make an election under Sec. 1.1502-91(d)(4) 
(concerning an election to treat the loss subgroup parent requirement as 
having been satisfied).
    (ii) X's acquisition of S and T results in S and T becoming members 
of the X group (the SRLY event). With respect to the Year 1 net 
operating loss, S and T compose a SRLY subgroup under paragraph (c)(2) 
of this section.
    (iii) S and T do not bear (and are not treated as bearing) a section 
1504(a)(1) relationship. Therefore S and T do not qualify as a loss 
subgroup under Sec. 1.1502-91(d)(1). X's acquisition of S and T results 
in separate ownership changes of S and T, that give rise to separate 
limitations under section 382(a) (the section 382 events) with respect 
to each of S and T's Year 1 net operating loss carryovers. See Sec. 
1.1502-94.
    (iv) The SRLY event and the change dates of the section 382 events 
occur on the same date. However, paragraph (g)(1) of this section does 
not apply because the SRLY subgroup (composed of S and T) is not 
coextensive with a loss subgroup with respect to the Year 1 carryovers. 
Consequently, the Year 1 net operating loss is subject to both a SRLY 
subgroup limitation and also separate section 382 limitations for each 
of S and T.
    Example 7. No overlap--Different subgroups. (i) Individual A owns 
all of the stock of T and all of the stock of S, the common parent of a 
consolidated group. B, an individual unrelated to Individual A, owns all 
of the stock of P, the common parent of another consolidated group. In 
Year 1, T has a net operating loss of $100 that is carried forward. At 
the end of Year 2, S acquires all of the stock of T from Individual A. 
In Year 3, the S group sustains a $200 consolidated net operating loss 
that is carried forward. In Year 8, the P group acquires all of the 
stock of S from Individual A.
    (ii) S's acquisition of T in Year 1 results in T becoming a member 
of the S group. The acquisition, however, did not result in an ownership 
change under section 382(g). As a result, T's Year 1 net operating loss 
is subject to SRLY within the S group. At the end of Year 7, Sec. 
1.1502-96(a) treats T's Year 1 net operating loss as not having arisen 
in a SRLY with respect to the S group. Section 1.1502-96(a), however, 
applies only for purposes of Sec. Sec. 1.1502-91 through 1.1502-96 and 
Sec. 1.1502-98 but not for purposes of this section. See Sec. 1.1502-
96(a)(5).
    (iii) P's acquisition of S in Year 8 results in S and T becoming 
members of the P group (the SRLY event). With respect to the Year 1 net 
operating loss, S and T do not compose a SRLY subgroup under paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section.
    (iv) S and T compose a loss subgroup under Sec. 1.1502-91(d)(1) 
with respect to the Year 1 net operating loss carryover. P's acquisition 
of S results in an ownership change of the loss subgroup, within the 
meaning of section 382(g), that gives rise to a subgroup limitation 
under section 382(a) (the section 382 event) with respect to that 
carryover.

[[Page 359]]

    (v) The SRLY event and the change date of the section 382 event 
occur on the same date. However, under paragraph (g)(4) of this section, 
because the SRLY subgroup and the loss subgroup are not coextensive, T's 
Year 1 net operating loss carryover is subject to a SRLY limitation.
    (vi) With respect to the Year 3 net operating loss carryover, S and 
T compose both a SRLY subgroup and a loss subgroup under Sec. 1.1502-
91(d)(1). Thus, paragraph (g)(1) of this section applies, and the S 
group's Year 3 net operating loss carryover is not subject to a SRLY 
limitation.
    Example 8. SRLY after overlap. (i) Individual A owns all of the 
stock of R and M, each the common parent of a consolidated group. B, an 
individual unrelated to Individual A, owns all of the stock of D. In 
Year 1, D incurs a $100 net operating loss that is carried forward. At 
the beginning of Year 3, R acquires all of the stock of D. In Year 5, M 
acquires all of the stock of R in a transaction that did not result in 
an ownership change of R.
    (ii) R's Year 3 acquisition of D results in D becoming a member of 
the R group (the SRLY event) and also results in an ownership change of 
D, that gives rise to a limitation under section 382(a) (the section 382 
event) with respect to D's net operating loss carryover.
    (iii) Because the SRLY event and the change date of the section 382 
event occur on the same date, there is an overlap of the application of 
paragraph (c) of this section and section 382 with respect to D's net 
operating loss. Consequently, under this paragraph (g), D's Year 1 $100 
net operating loss is not subject to a SRLY limitation in the R group.
    (iv) M's Year 5 acquisition of R results in R and D becoming members 
of the M group (the SRLY event), but does not result in an ownership 
change of R or D that gives rise to a limitation under section 382(a). 
Because there is no section 382 event, the application of the SRLY rules 
and section 382 do not overlap. Consequently, D's Year 1 $100 net 
operating loss is subject to a SRLY limitation in the M group.
    (v) Because D's Year 1 net operating loss carryover was subject to 
the overlap rule of paragraph (g) of this section when it joined the R 
group, under Sec. 1.1502-21(c)(2), the SRLY subgroup with respect to 
that carryover includes all of the members of the R group that joined 
the M group at the same time as D.
    Example 9. Overlap--Interim losses. (i) Individual A owns all of the 
stock of P and S, each the common parent of a consolidated group. S owns 
all of the stock of T, its only subsidiary. B, an individual unrelated 
to Individual A, owns all of the stock of M, the common parent of a 
consolidated group. In Year 1, the S group has a $100 consolidated net 
operating loss. On January 1 of Year 2, P acquires all of the stock of S 
from Individual A. On December 31 of Year 2, M acquires 51% of the stock 
of P from Individual A. On May 31 of Year 3, M acquires the remaining 
49% of the stock of P from Individual A. The P group, for the Year 3 
period prior to June 1, had a $50 consolidated net operating loss, and 
under paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section, the loss is attributable 
entirely to S. Other than the losses described above, the P group does 
not have any other consolidated net operating losses.
    (ii) In the P group, S's $100 loss carryover is treated as arising 
in a SRLY and is subject to the limitation under paragraph (c) of this 
section. A SRLY subgroup with respect to that loss is composed of S and 
T, the members which were members of the S group as to which the loss 
was not a SRLY.
    (iii) M's December 31 purchase of 51% of P is a section 382 event 
because it results in an ownership change of the S loss subgroup that 
gives rise to a section 382(a) limitation (the section 382 event) with 
respect to the Year 1 net operating loss carryover. The purchase, 
however, does not result in an ownership change of P because it is not a 
loss corporation under section 382(k)(1). M's May 31 purchase of 49% of 
P results in P, S, and T becoming members of the M group and is 
therefore a SRLY event.
    (iv) With respect to the Year 1 net operating loss, S and T compose 
a SRLY subgroup under paragraph (c)(2) of this section and a loss 
subgroup under Sec. 1.1502-91(d)(1). The loss subgroup does not include 
P because the only loss at the time of the section 382 event was subject 
to SRLY with respect to the P group. See Sec. 1.1502-91(d)(1).
    (v) Because the SRLY event occured within six months of the change 
date of the section 382 event and the SRLY subgroup and loss subgroup 
are coextensive with respect to the Year 1 net operating loss carryover, 
there is an overlap of the application of the SRLY rules and the 
application of section 382 within the meaning of paragraph (g) of this 
section. Thus, the SRLY limitation does not apply to that carryover.
    (vi) The Year 3 net operating loss, which arose between the section 
382 event and the SRLY event, is a net operating loss described in 
paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(B) of this section because it is the net operating 
loss of a corporation whose SRLY event occurs within the six month 
period beginning on the date of a section 382 event.
    (vii) With respect to the Year 3 net operating loss, P, S, and T 
compose a SRLY subgroup under paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Because 
P, a member of the SRLY subgroup for the Year 3 carryover, is not also a 
member of a SRLY subgroup that has net operating loss carryovers 
described in paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(A) of this section (the Year 1 net 
operating loss), the Year 3 carryover is subject

[[Page 360]]

to a SRLY limitation in the M group. See paragraph (g)(4)(ii) of this 
section.

    (h) Effective date--(1) In general. This section generally applies 
to taxable years for which the due date (without extensions) of the 
consolidated return is after June 25, 1999. However--
    (i) In the event that paragraph (g)(1) of this section does not 
apply to a particular net operating loss carryover in the current group, 
then solely for purposes of applying paragraph (c) of this section to 
determine a limitation with respect to that carryover and with respect 
to which the SRLY register (consolidated taxable income determined by 
reference to only the member's or subgroup's items of income, gain, 
deduction, or loss) began in a taxable year for which the due date of 
the return was on or before June 25, 1999, paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section shall be applied without regard to the phrase ``or for a 
carryover that was subject to the overlap rule described in paragraph 
(g) of this section or Sec. 1.1502-15(g) with respect to another group 
(the former group)''; and
    (ii) For purposes of paragraph (g) of this section, only an 
ownership change to which section 382(a), as amended by the Tax Reform 
Act of 1986, applies shall constitute a section 382 event.
    (2) SRLY limitation. Except in the case of those members (including 
members of a SRLY subgroup) described in paragraph (h)(3) of this 
section, a group does not take into account a consolidated taxable year 
beginning before January 1, 1997, in determining the aggregate of the 
consolidated taxable income under paragraph (c)(1) of this section 
(including for purposes of Sec. 1.1502-15 and Sec. 1.1502-22(c)) for 
the members (or SRLY subgroups).
    (3) Prior retroactive election. A consolidated group that applied 
the rules of Sec. 1.1502-21T(g)(3) in effect prior to June 25, 1999, as 
contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 1999, to all consolidated 
return years ending on or after January 29, 1991, and beginning before 
January 1, 1997, does not take into account a consolidated taxable year 
beginning before January 29, 1991, in determining the aggregate of the 
consolidated taxable income under paragraph (c)(1) of this section 
(including for purposes of Sec. 1.1502-15 and Sec. 1.1502-22(c)) for 
the members (or SRLY subgroups).
    (4) Offspring rule. Paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section applies 
to net operating losses arising in taxable years ending on or after June 
25, 1999.
    (5) Waiver of carrybacks. Paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B) of this section 
(relating to the waiver of carrybacks for acquired members) applies to 
acquisitions occurring after June 25, 1999.

Sec. 1.1502-21T  Net operating losses (temporary).

    (a) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1502-21(a).
    (b) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1502-21(b).
    (1) Carryovers and carrybacks generally. The net operating loss 
carryovers and carrybacks to a taxable year are determined under the 
principles of section 172 and this section. Thus, losses permitted to be 
absorbed in a consolidated return year generally are absorbed in the 
order of the taxable years in which they arose, and losses carried from 
taxable years ending on the same date, and which are available to offset 
consolidated taxable income for the year, generally are absorbed on a 
pro rata basis. In addition, the amount of any CNOL absorbed by the 
group in any year is apportioned among members based on the percentage 
of the CNOL attributable to each member as of the beginning of the year. 
The percentage of the CNOL attributable to a member is determined 
pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. Additional rules 
provided under the Internal Revenue Code or regulations also apply. See, 
e.g., section

[[Page 361]]

382(l)(2)(B) (if losses are carried from the same taxable year, losses 
subject to limitation under section 382 are absorbed before losses that 
are not subject to limitation under section 382). See Sec. 1.1502-
21(c)(1)(iii), Example 2, for an illustration of pro rata absorption of 
losses subject to a SRLY limitation. See paragraph (b)(3)(v) of this 
section regarding the treatment of any loss that is treated as expired 
under Sec. 1.1502-35T(f)(1).
    (2) (i) through (iii) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see Sec. 
1.1502-21(b)(2) (i) through (iii).
    (iv) Operating rules--(A) Amount of CNOL attributable to a member. 
The amount of a CNOL that is attributable to a member shall equal the 
product of the CNOL and the percentage of the CNOL attributable to such 
member.
    (B) Percentage of CNOL attributable to a member--(1) In general. 
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B)(2) of this section, the 
percentage of the CNOL attributable to a member shall equal the separate 
net operating loss of the member for the year of the loss divided by the 
sum of the separate net operating losses for that year of all members 
having such losses. For this purpose, the separate net operating loss of 
a member is determined by computing the CNOL by reference to only the 
member's items of income, gain, deduction, and loss, including the 
member's losses and deductions actually absorbed by the group in the 
taxable year (whether or not absorbed by the member).
    (2) Special rule. If during a taxable year either a member realizes 
discharge of indebtedness income that is excluded from gross income 
under section 108(a) and such amount reduces any portion of the CNOL 
attributable to such member pursuant to section 108 and Sec. 1.1502-
28T, or a member that had a separate net operating loss for the year of 
the CNOL ceases to be a member, the percentage of the CNOL attributable 
to each member as of the first day of the following taxable year shall 
be recomputed. In addition, if a portion of the CNOL attributable to a 
member for a taxable year is carried back to a separate return year, the 
percentage of the CNOL attributable to each member as of the first day 
of the taxable year following the taxable year of the CNOL shall be 
recomputed. In each case, such recomputed percentage shall equal the 
unabsorbed CNOL attributable to the member on the first day of the 
following taxable year divided by the sum of the unabsorbed CNOL 
attributable to all of the members on the first day of the following 
taxable year. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a CNOL that is 
reduced pursuant to section 108 and Sec. 1.1502-28T or that is 
otherwise permanently disallowed or eliminated shall be treated as 
absorbed.
    (b)(2)(v) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1502-
21(b)(2)(v) through (b)(3)(ii)(B).
    (3) Special rules--(i) Election to relinquish carryback. A group may 
make an irrevocable election under section 172(b)(3) to relinquish the 
entire carryback period with respect to a CNOL for any consolidated 
return year. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B) of this 
section, the election may not be made separately for any member (whether 
or not it remains a member), and must be made in a separate statement 
entitled ``THIS IS AN ELECTION UNDER Sec. 1.1502-21(b)(3)(i) TO WAIVE 
THE ENTIRE CARRYBACK PERIOD PURSUANT TO SECTION 172(b)(3) FOR THE 
[insert consolidated return year] CNOLs OF THE CONSOLIDATED GROUP OF 
WHICH [insert name and employer identification number of common parent] 
IS THE COMMON PARENT''. The statement must be filed with the group's 
income tax return for the consolidated return year in which the loss 
arises. If the consolidated return year in which the loss arises begins 
before January 1, 2003, the statement making the election must be signed 
by the common parent. If the consolidated return year in which the loss 
arises begins after December 31, 2002, the election may be made in an 
unsigned statement.
    (b)(3)(ii) through (b)(3)(ii)(A) [Reserved]. For further guidance, 
see Sec. 1.1502-21 (b)(3)(ii) through (b)(3)(ii)(A).
    (B) Acquisition of member from another consolidated group. If one or 
more members of a consolidated group becomes a member of another 
consolidated group, the acquiring group may make an irrevocable election 
to relinquish, with

[[Page 362]]

respect to all consolidated net operating losses attributable to the 
member, the portion of the carryback period for which the corporation 
was a member of another group, provided that any other corporation 
joining the acquiring group that was affiliated with the member 
immediately before it joined the acquiring group is also included in the 
waiver. This election is not a yearly election and applies to all losses 
that would otherwise be subject to a carryback to a former group under 
section 172. The election must be made in a separate statement entitled 
``THIS IS AN ELECTION UNDER Sec. 1.1502-21(b)(3)(ii)(B)(2) TO WAIVE THE 
PRE-[insert first taxable year for which the member (or members) was not 
a member of another group] CARRYBACK PERIOD FOR THE CNOLs attributable 
to [insert names and employer identification number of members].'' The 
statement must be filed with the acquiring consolidated group's original 
income tax return for the year the corporation (or corporations) became 
a member. If the year in which the corporation (or corporations) became 
a member begins before January 1, 2003, the statement must be signed by 
the common parent and each of the members to which it applies. If the 
year in which the corporation (or corporations) became a member begins 
after December 31, 2002, the election may be made in an unsigned 
statement.
    (C) Partial waiver of carryback period for 2001 and 2002 losses--(1) 
Application. The acquiring group may make the elections described in 
paragraphs (b)(3)(ii)(C)(2) and (3) of this section with respect to an 
acquired member or members only if it did not file a valid election 
described in Sec. 1.1502-21(b)(3)(ii)(B) with respect to such acquired 
member or members on or before May 31, 2002.
    (2) Partial waiver of entire pre-acquisition carryback period. If 
one or more members of a consolidated group become members of another 
consolidated group after June 25, 1999, then, with respect to all 
consolidated net operating losses attributable to the member for the 
taxable year ending during either 2001 or 2002, or both, the acquiring 
group may make an irrevocable election to relinquish the portion of the 
carryback period for such losses for which the corporation was a member 
of another group, provided that any other corporation joining the 
acquiring group that was affiliated with the member immediately before 
it joined the acquiring group is also included in the waiver and that 
the conditions of this paragraph are satisfied. The acquiring group 
cannot make the election described in this paragraph with respect to any 
consolidated net operating losses arising in a particular taxable year 
if any carryback is claimed, as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(C)(4) 
of this section, with respect to any such losses on a return or other 
filing by a group of which the acquired member was previously a member 
and such claim is filed on or before the date the election described in 
this paragraph is filed. The election must be made in a separate 
statement entitled ``THIS IS AN ELECTION UNDER SECTION 1.1502-21T 
(b)(3)(ii)(C)(2) TO WAIVE THE PRE-[insert first day of the first taxable 
year for which the member (or members) was a member of the acquiring 
group] CARRYBACK PERIOD FOR THE CNOLS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE [insert 
taxable year of losses] TAXABLE YEAR(S) OF [insert names and employer 
identification numbers of members].'' Such statement must be filed as 
provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(C)(5) of this section.
    (3) Partial waiver of pre-acquisition extended carryback period. If 
one or more members of a consolidated group become members of another 
consolidated group, then, with respect to all consolidated net operating 
losses attributable to the member for the taxable year ending during 
either 2001 or 2002, or both, the acquiring group may make an 
irrevocable election to relinquish the portion of the carryback period 
for such losses for which the corporation was a member of another group 
to the extent that such carryback period includes one or more taxable 
years that are prior to the taxable year that is 2 taxable years 
preceding the taxable year of the loss, provided that any other 
corporation joining the acquiring group that was affiliated with the 
member immediately before it joined the acquiring group is also included 
in the waiver and that the conditions of

[[Page 363]]

this paragraph are satisfied. The acquiring group cannot make the 
election described in this paragraph with respect to any consolidated 
net operating losses arising in a particular taxable year if a carryback 
to one or more taxable years that are prior to the taxable year that is 
2 taxable years preceding the taxable year of the loss is claimed, as 
provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(C)(4) of this section, with respect to 
any such losses on a return or other filing by a group of which the 
acquired member was previously a member and such claim is filed on or 
before the date the election described in this paragraph is filed. The 
election must be made in a separate statement entitled ``THIS IS AN 
ELECTION UNDER SECTION 1.1502-21T (b)(3)(ii)(C)(3) TO WAIVE THE PRE-
[insert first day of the first taxable year for which the member (or 
members) was a member of the acquiring group] EXTENDED CARRYBACK PERIOD 
FOR THE CNOLS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE [insert taxable year of losses] 
TAXABLE YEAR(S) OF [insert names and employer identification numbers of 
members].'' Such statement must be filed as provided in paragraph 
(b)(3)(ii)(C)(5) of this section.
    (4) Claim for a carryback. For purposes of paragraphs 
(b)(3)(ii)(C)(2) and (3) of this section, a carryback is claimed with 
respect to a consolidated net operating loss if there is a claim for 
refund, an amended return, an application for a tentative carryback 
adjustment, or any other filing that claims the benefit of the net 
operating loss in a taxable year prior to the taxable year of the loss, 
whether or not subsequently revoked in favor of a claim based on a 5-
year carryback period.
    (5) Time and manner for filing statement. A statement described in 
paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(C)(2) or (3) of this section that relates to 
consolidated net operating losses attributable to a taxable year ending 
during 2001 must be filed with the acquiring consolidated group's timely 
filed (including extensions) original or amended return for the taxable 
year ending during 2001, provided that such original or amended return 
is filed on or before October 31, 2002. A statement described in 
paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(C)(2) or (3) of this section that relates to 
consolidated net operating losses attributable to a taxable year ending 
during 2002 must be filed with the acquiring consolidated group's timely 
filed (including extensions) original or amended return for the taxable 
year ending during 2001 or 2002, provided that such original or amended 
return is filed on or before September 15, 2003.
    (b)(3)(iii) and (b)(3)(iv) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see 
Sec. 1.1502-21(b)(3)(iii) and (b)(3)(iv).
    (b)(3)(v) Losses treated as expired under Sec. 1.1502-35T(f)(1). No 
loss treated as expired by Sec. 1.1502-35T(f)(1) may be carried over to 
any consolidated return year of the group.
    (c)(1) through (c)(2)(vi) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see 
Sec. 1.1502-21(c)(1) through (c)(2)(vi).
    (vii) Corporations that leave a SRLY subgroup. If a loss member 
ceases to be affiliated with a SRLY subgroup, the amount of the member's 
remaining SRLY loss from a specific year is determined pursuant to the 
principles of Sec. 1.1502-21(b)(2)(ii)(A) and Sec. 1.1502-
21T(b)(2)(iv).
    (c)(2)(viii) through (h)(5) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see 
Sec. 1.1502-21(c)(2)(viii) through (h)(5).
    (6) Certain prior periods. Paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2)(iv), and 
(c)(2)(vii) of this section shall only apply to taxable years the 
original return for which the due date (without extensions) is after 
August 29, 2003. For taxable years the original return for which the due 
date (without extensions) is on or before August 29, 2003, see 
paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2)(iv), and (c)(2)(vii) of Sec. 1.1502-21 and 
paragraph (b)(1) of Sec. 1.1502-21T as contained in 26 CFR part 1 
revised April 1, 2003.

Sec. 1.1502-22  Consolidated capital gain and loss.

    (a) Capital gain. The determinations under section 1222, including 
capital gain net income, net long-term capital gain, and net capital 
gain, with respect to members during consolidated return years are not 
made separately. Instead, consolidated amounts are determined for the 
group as a whole. The consolidated capital gain net income for any 
consolidated return year is determined by reference to--
    (1) The aggregate gains and losses of members from sales or 
exchanges of capital assets for the year (other than gains and losses to 
which section 1231 applies);
    (2) The consolidated net section 1231 gain for the year (determined 
under Sec. 1.1502-23); and
    (3) The net capital loss carryovers or carrybacks to the year.
    (b) Net capital loss carryovers and carrybacks--(1) In general. The 
determinations under section 1222, including net capital loss and net 
short-term capital loss, with respect to members during consolidated 
return years are not made separately. Instead, consolidated amounts are 
determined for the group as a whole. Losses included in the consolidated 
net capital loss may be carried to consolidated return years, and, after 
apportionment, may be carried to separate return years. The net capital 
loss carryovers and carrybacks consist of--
    (i) Any consolidated net capital losses of the group; and
    (ii) Any net capital losses of the members arising in separate 
return years.
    (2) Carryovers and carrybacks generally. The net capital loss 
carryovers and carrybacks to a taxable year are determined under the 
principles of section 1212 and this section. Thus, losses permitted to 
be absorbed in a consolidated return year generally are absorbed in the 
order of the taxable years in which they were sustained, and losses 
carried from taxable years ending on the same date, and which are 
available to offset consolidated capital gain net income, generally are 
absorbed on a pro rata basis. Additional rules provided under the 
Internal Revenue Code or regulations also apply, as well as the SRLY 
limitation under paragraph (c) of this section. See, e.g., section 
382(l)(2)(B).
    (3) Carryovers and carrybacks of consolidated net capital losses to 
separate return years. If any consolidated net capital loss that is 
attributable to a member may be carried to a separate return year under 
the principles of Sec. 1.1502-21(b)(2), the amount of the consolidated 
net capital loss that is attributable to the member is apportioned and 
carried to the separate return year (apportioned loss).
    (4) Special rules--(i) Short years in connection with transactions 
to which section 381(a) applies. If a member distributes or transfers 
assets to a corporation that is a member immediately after the 
distribution or transfer in a transaction to which section 381(a) 
applies, the transaction does not cause the distributor or transferor to 
have a short year within the consolidated return year of the group in 
which the transaction occurred that is counted as a separate year for 
purposes of determining the years to which a net capital loss may be 
carried.
    (ii) Special status losses. [Reserved]
    (c) Limitations on net capital loss carryovers and carrybacks from 
separate return limitation years. The aggregate of the net capital 
losses of a member arising (or treated as arising) in SRLYs that are 
included in the determination of consolidated capital gain net income 
for all consolidated return years of the group under paragraph (a) of 
this section may not exceed the aggregate of the consolidated capital 
gain net income for all consolidated return years of the group 
determined by reference to only the member's items of gain and loss from 
capital assets as defined in section 1221 and trade or business assets 
defined in section 1231(b), including the member's losses actually 
absorbed by the group in the taxable year (whether or not absorbed by 
the member). The principles of Sec. 1.1502-21(c) (including the SRLY 
subgroup principles under Sec. 1.1502-21(c)(2)) apply with appropriate 
adjustments for purposes of applying this paragraph (c).
    (d) Coordination with respect to consolidated return change of 
ownership limitation occurring in consolidated return years beginning 
before January 1, 1997. If

[[Page 365]]

a consolidated return change of ownership occurred before January 1, 
1997, the principles of Sec. 1.1502-22A(d) apply to determine the 
amount of the aggregate of the net capital loss attributable to old 
members of the group (as those terms are defined in Sec. 1.1502-1(g)), 
that may be included in the net capital loss carryover under paragraph 
(b) of this section. For this purpose, Sec. 1.1502-1(g) is applied by 
treating that date as the end of the year of change.
    (e) Consolidated net capital loss. Any excess of losses over gains, 
as determined under paragraph (a) of this section (without regard to any 
carryovers or carrybacks), is also referred to as the consolidated net 
capital loss.
    (f) Predecessors and successors. For purposes of this section, the 
principles of Sec. 1.1502-21(f) apply with appropriate adjustments.
    (g) Overlap with section 383--(1) General rule. The limitation 
provided in paragraph (c) of this section does not apply to net capital 
loss carryovers ((other than a hypothetical carryover like those 
described in Sec. 1.1502-21(c)(1)(i)(D) and a carryover like those 
described in Sec. 1.1502-21(c)(1)(ii)) when the application of 
paragraph (c) of this section results in an overlap with the application 
of section 383. For a similar rule applying in the case of net capital 
loss carryovers like those described in Sec. Sec. 1.1502-21(c)(1)(i)(D) 
and (c)(1)(ii), see Sec. 1.1502-15(g).
    (2) Definitions--(i) Generally. For purposes of this paragraph (g), 
the definitions and nomenclature contained in sections 382 and 383, the 
regulations thereunder, and Sec. Sec. 1.1502-90 through 1.1502-99 
apply.
    (ii) Overlap. (A) An overlap of the application of paragraph (c) of 
this section and the application of section 383 with respect to a net 
capital loss carryover occurs if a corporation becomes a member of the 
consolidated group (the SRLY event) within six months of the change date 
of an ownership change giving rise to a section 382 limitation with 
respect to that carryover (the section 383 event).
    (B) If an overlap described in paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(A) of this 
section occurs with respect to net capital loss carryovers of a 
corporation whose SRLY event occurs within the six month period 
beginning on the date of a section 383 event, then an overlap is treated 
as also occurring with respect to that corporation's net capital loss 
carryover that arises within the period beginning with the section 383 
event and ending with the SRLY event.
    (C) For special rules in the event that there is a SRLY subgroup 
and/or a loss subgroup as defined in Sec. 1.1502-91(d)(1) with respect 
to a carryover, see paragraph (g)(4) of this section.
    (3) Operating rules--(i) Section 383 event before SRLY event. If a 
SRLY event occurs on the same date as a section 383 event or within the 
six month period beginning on the date of the section 383 event, 
paragraph (g)(1) of this section applies beginning with the tax year 
that includes the SRLY event.
    (ii) SRLY event before section 383 event. If a section 383 event 
occurs within the period beginning the day after the SRLY event and 
ending six months after the SRLY event, paragraph (g)(1) of this section 
applies starting with the first tax year that begins after the section 
383 event.
    (4) Subgroup rules. In general, in the case of a net capital loss 
carryover for which there is a SRLY subgroup and a loss subgroup (as 
defined in Sec. 1.1502-91(d)(1)), the principles of this paragraph (g) 
apply to the SRLY subgroup, and not separately to its members. However, 
paragraph (g)(1) of this section applies--
    (i) With respect to a carryover described in paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(A) 
of this section only if--
    (A) All members of the SRLY subgroup with respect to that carryover 
are also included in a loss subgroup with respect to that carryover; and
    (B) All members of a loss subgroup with respect to that carryover 
are also members of a SRLY subgroup with respect to that carryover; and
    (ii) With respect to a carryover described in paragraph 
(g)(2)(ii)(B) of this section only if all members of the SRLY subgroup 
for that carryover are also members of a SRLY subgroup that has net 
capital loss carryovers described in paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(A) of this 
section that are subject to the overlap rule of paragraph (g)(1) of this 
section.
    (h) Effective date--(1) In general. This section generally applies 
to taxable

[[Page 366]]

years for which the due date (without extensions) of the consolidated 
return is after June 25, 1999. However--
    (i) In the event that paragraph (g)(1) of this section does not 
apply to a particular net capital loss carryover in the current group, 
then solely for purposes of applying paragraph (c) of this section to 
determine a limitation with respect to that carryover and with respect 
to which the SRLY register (consolidated taxable income determined by 
reference to only the member's or subgroup's items of income, gain, 
deduction, or loss) began in a taxable year for which the due date of 
the return was on or before June 25, 1999, the principles of Sec. 
1.1502-21(c)(2) shall be applied without regard to the phrase ``or for a 
carryover that was subject to the overlap rule described in paragraph 
(g) of this section or Sec. 1.1502-15(g) with respect to another group 
(the former group)''; and
    (ii) For purposes of paragraph (g) of this section, only an 
ownership change to which section 383, as amended by the Tax Reform Act 
of 1986, applies and which results in a section 382 limitation shall 
constitute a section 383 event.
    (2) Prior periods. For certain taxable years ending on or before 
June 25, 1999, see Sec. 1.1502-22T in effect prior to June 25, 1999, as 
contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 1999, as applicable.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1502-23  Consolidated net section 1231 gain or loss.

    (a) In general. Net section 1231 gains and losses of members arising 
during consolidated return years are not determined separately. Instead, 
the consolidated net section 1231 gain or loss is determined under this 
section for the group as a whole.
    (b) Example. The following example illustrates the provisions of 
this section:

    Example. Use of SRLY registers with net gains and net losses under 
section 1231. (i) In Year 1, T sustains a $20 net capital loss. At the 
beginning of Year 2, T becomes a member of the P group. T's capital loss 
carryover from Year 1 is subject to SRLY limits under Sec. 1.1502-
22(c). The members of the P group contribute the following to the 
consolidated taxable income for Year 2 (computed without regard to T's 
net capital loss carryover under Sec. 1.1502-22):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                           P        T
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              Year 1 (SRLY)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ordinary..............................................  .......  .......
Capital...............................................  .......     (20)
                                 Year 2
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ordinary..............................................       10       20
Capital...............................................       70        0
Sec.  1231...........................................     (60)       30
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) Under section 1231, if the section 1231 losses for any taxable 
year exceed the section 1231 gains for such taxable year, such gains and 
losses are treated as ordinary gains or losses. Because the P group's 
section 1231 losses, $(60), exceed the section 1231 gains, $30, the P 
group's net loss is treated as an ordinary loss. T's net section 1231 
gain has the same character as the P group's consolidated net section 
1231 loss, so T's $30 of section 1231 income is treated as ordinary 
income for purposes of applying Sec. 1.1502-22(c). Under Sec. 1.1502-
22(c), the group's consolidated net capital gain determined by reference 
only to T's items is $0. None of T's capital loss carryover from Year 1 
may be taken into account in Year 2.

    (c) Recapture of ordinary loss. [Reserved]
    (d) Effective date--(1) In general. This section applies to gains 
and losses arising in the determination of consolidated net section 1231 
gain or loss for taxable years for which the due date (without 
extensions) of the consolidated return is after June 25, 1999.
    (2) Application to prior periods. See Sec. 1.1502-21(h)(3) for 
rules applicable to groups that applied the rules of this section to 
consolidated return years ending on or after January 29, 1991, and 
beginning before January 1, 1997.

Sec. 1.1502-24  Consolidated charitable contributions deduction.

    (a) Determination of amount of consolidated charitable contributions 
deduction. The deduction allowed by section 170 for the taxable year 
shall be the lesser of:
    (1) The aggregate deductions of the members of the group allowable 
under section 170 (determined without regard to section 170(b)(2)), plus 
the consolidated charitable contribution carryovers to such year, or

[[Page 367]]

    (2) Five percent of the adjusted consolidated taxable income as 
determined under paragraph (c) of this section.
    (b) Carryover of excess charitable contributions. The consolidated 
charitable contribution carryovers to any consolidated return year shall 
consist of any excess consolidated charitable contributions of the 
group, plus any excess charitable contributions of members of the group 
arising in separate return years of such members, which may be carried 
over to the taxable year under the principles of section 170(b) (2) and 
(3). However, such consolidated carryovers shall not include any excess 
charitable contributions apportioned to a corporation for a separate 
return year pursuant to paragraph (e) of Sec. 1.1502-79.
    (c) Adjusted consolidated taxable income. For purposes of this 
section, the adjusted consolidated taxable income of the group for any 
consolidated return year shall be the consolidated taxable income 
computed without regard to this section, section 242, section 243(a) (2) 
and (3), Sec. 1.1502-25, Sec. 1.1502-26, and Sec. 1.1502-27, and 
without regard to any consolidated net operating or net capital loss 
carrybacks to such year.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1502-26  Consolidated dividends received deduction.

    (a) In general. (1) The consolidated dividends received deduction 
for the taxable year shall be the lesser of:
    (i) The aggregate of the deduction of the members of the group 
allowable under sections 243(a)(1), 244(a), and 245 (computed without 
regard to the limitations provided in section 246(b)), or
    (ii) 85 percent of the consolidated taxable income computed without 
regard to the consolidated net operating loss deduction, consolidated 
section 247 deduction, the consolidated dividends received deduction, 
and any consolidated net capital loss carryback to the taxable year.

Subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph shall not apply for any 
consolidated return year for which there is a consolidated net operating 
loss. (See Sec. Sec. 1.1502-21(e) or 1.1502-21A(f), as appropriate for 
the definition of a consolidated net operating loss.)
    (2) If any member computes a deduction under section 593(b)(2) for a 
taxable year beginning after July 11, 1969, and ending before August 30, 
1975, the deduction otherwise computed under this section shall be 
reduced by an amount determined by multiplying the deduction (determined 
without regard to this sentence and without regard to dividends received 
by the common parent if such parent does not use the percentage of 
income method provided by section 593(b)(2)) by the applicable 
percentage of the member with the highest applicable percentage 
(determined under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of section 593(b)(2)).
    (3) For taxable years ending on or after August 30, 1975, the 
deduction otherwise computed under this section shall be reduced by the 
sum of the amounts determined under paragraph (a)(4) of this section for 
each member that is a thrift institution that computes a deduction under 
section 593(b)(2).
    (4) For each thrift institution, the amount determined under this 
subparagraph is the product of:
    (i) The portion of the deduction determined with regard to the sum 
of the dividends received by: (A) The thrift institution, and (B) any 
member in which that thrift institution owns, directly and with the 
application of paragraph (a)(5) of this section, 5 percent or more of 
the stock on any day during the consolidated return year, and
    (ii) The thrift institution's applicable percentage determined under 
subparagraphs (A) and (B) of section 593(b)(2).

For purposes of this subparagraph, dividends allocated to a thrift 
institution under Sec. 1.596-1(c) shall be considered received by the 
thrift institution.
    (5) For purposes of paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, a member 
owning stock of another member (the ``second member'') shall be 
considered as owning its proportionate share of any stock of a member 
owned by the second member. Stock considered as being owned by reason of 
the preceding sentence shall, for purposes of applying that sentence, be 
treated as actually owned. The proportionate share of stock in a member 
owned by another member is the proportion which the value of the stock 
so

[[Page 368]]

owned bears to the value of all the outstanding stock in the member. For 
purposes of this paragraph the term ``stock'' includes nonvoting stock 
which is limited and preferred as to dividends.
    (6) For purposes of paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, if two or 
more thrift institutions that are both members of the group each owns 5 
percent or more of the same member's stock, the member's stock will be 
considered to be owned only by the thrift institution with the highest 
applicable percentage.
    (b) Intercompany dividends. The deduction determined under paragraph 
(a) of this section is determined without taking into account 
intercompany dividends to the extent that, under Sec. 1.1502-13(f)(2), 
they are not included in gross income. See Sec. 1.1502-13 for 
additional rules relating to intercompany dividends.
    (c) Examples. The provisions of this section may be illustrated by 
the following examples:

    Example (1). Corporations P, S, and S-1 filed a consolidated return 
for the calendar year 1966 showing consolidated taxable income of 
$100,000 (determined without regard to the consolidated net operating 
loss deduction, consolidated dividends received deduction, and the 
consolidated section 247 deduction). Such corporations received 
dividends during such year from nonmember domestic corporations as 
follows:

 
                                                               Dividends
 
Corporation:
  P.........................................................      $6,000
  S.........................................................      10,000
  S-1.......................................................      34,000
                                                             -----------
    Total...................................................      50,000
 


The dividends received deduction allowable to each member under section 
243(a)(1) (computed without regard to the limitation in section 246(b)) 
is as follows: P has $5,100 (85 percent of $6,000), S has $8,500 (85 
percent of $10,000), and S-1 has $28,900 (85 percent of $34,000), or a 
total of $42,500. Since $42,500 is less than $85,000 (85 percent of 
$100,000), the consolidated dividends received deduction is $42,500.
    Example (2). Assume the same facts as in example (1) except that 
consolidated taxable income (computed without regard to the consolidated 
net operating loss deduction, consolidated dividends received deduction, 
and the consolidated section 247 deduction) was $40,000. The aggregate 
of the dividends received deductions, $42,500, computed without regard 
to section 246(b), results in a consolidated net operating loss of 
$2,500. See section 172(d)(6). Therefore, paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section does not apply and the consolidated dividends received deduction 
is $42,500.

Sec. 1.1502-27  Consolidated section 247 deduction.

    (a) Amount of deduction. The consolidated section 247 deduction for 
the taxable year shall be an amount computed as follows:
    (1) First, determine the amount which is the lesser of:
    (i) The aggregate of the dividends paid (within the meaning of 
section 247(a)) during such year by members of the group which are 
public utilities (within the meaning of section 247(b)(1)) on preferred 
stock (within the meaning of section 247(b)(2)), other than dividends 
paid to other members of the group, or
    (ii) The aggregate of the taxable income (or loss) (as determined 
under paragraph (b) of this section) of each such member which is a 
public utility.
    (2) Then, multiply the amount determined under subparagraph (1) of 
this paragraph by the fraction specified in section 247(a)(2).
    (b) Computation of taxable income. For purposes of paragraph 
(a)(1)(ii) of this section, the taxable income (or loss) of a member of 
the group described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) shall be determined under 
Sec. 1.1502-12, adjusted for the following items taken into account in 
the computation of consolidated taxable income:
    (1) The portion of the consolidated net operating loss deduction, 
the consolidated charitable contributions deduction, and the 
consolidated dividends received deduction, attributable to such member;
    (2) Such member's capital gain net income (net capital gain for 
taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) (determined without 
regard to any net capital loss carryover or carryback attributable to 
such member);
    (3) Such member's net capital loss and section 1231 net loss, 
reduced by

[[Page 369]]

the portion of the consolidated net capital loss attributable to such 
member; and
    (4) The portion of any consolidated net capital loss carryover or 
carryback attributable to such member which is absorbed in the taxable 
year.

[T.D. 6894, 31 FR 11794, Sept. 8, 1966, as amended by T.D. 7728, 45 FR 
72650, Nov. 3, 1980]


<R05>
Sec. 1.1502-28T  Consolidated section 108 (temporary).

    (a) In general. This section sets forth rules for the application of 
section 108(a) and the reduction of tax attributes pursuant to section 
108(b) when a member of the group realizes discharge of indebtedness 
income that is excluded from gross income under section 108(a) (excluded 
COD income).
    (1) Application of section 108(a). Section 108(a)(1)(B) is applied 
separately to each member that realizes excluded COD income. Therefore, 
the limitation of section 108(a)(3) on the amount of discharge of 
indebtedness income that is treated as excluded COD income is determined 
based on the assets (including stock and securities of other members) 
and liabilities (including liabilities to other members) of only the 
member that realizes excluded COD income.
    (2) Reduction of tax attributes attributable to the debtor--(i) In 
general. With respect to a member that realizes excluded COD income in a 
taxable year, the tax attributes attributable to that member (and its 
direct and indirect subsidiaries to the extent required by section 
1017(b)(3)(D) and paragraph (a)(3) of this section), including basis of 
assets and losses and credits arising in separate return limitation 
years, shall be reduced as provided in sections 108 and 1017 and this 
section. Basis of subsidiary stock, however, shall not be reduced below 
zero.
    (ii) Consolidated tax attributes attributable to a member. For 
purposes of this section, the amount of a consolidated tax attribute 
that is attributable to a member shall be determined pursuant to the 
principles of Sec. 1.1502-21T(b)(2)(iv). In addition, if the member is 
a member of a separate return limitation year subgroup, the amount of a 
tax attribute that arose in a separate return limitation year that is 
attributable to that member shall also be determined pursuant to the 
principles of Sec. 1.1502-21T(b)(2)(iv).
    (3) Look-through rules--(i) Priority of section 1017(b)(3)(D). If a 
member treats stock of a subsidiary as depreciable property pursuant to 
section 1017(b)(3)(D), the basis of the depreciable property of such 
subsidiary shall be reduced pursuant to section 1017(b)(3)(D) prior to 
the application of paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section.
    (ii) Application of additional look-through rule. If the basis of 
stock of a member (the lower-tier member) that is owned by another 
member is reduced pursuant to section 108, section 1017, and paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section (but not as a result of treating subsidiary stock 
as depreciable property pursuant to section 1017(b)(3)(D)), solely for 
purposes of sections 108 and 1017 and this section other than paragraphs 
(a)(4) and (b)(1) of this section, the lower-tier member shall be 
treated as realizing excluded COD income. The amount of such excluded 
COD income shall be the amount of such basis reduction. Accordingly, the 
tax attributes attributable to such lower-tier member shall be reduced 
as provided in sections 108 and 1017 and this section. To the extent 
that the excluded COD income realized by the lower-tier member pursuant 
to this paragraph (a)(3) does not reduce a tax attribute attributable to 
the lower-tier member, such excluded COD income shall not be applied to 
reduce tax attributes attributable to any member under paragraph (a)(4) 
of this section.
    (4) Reduction of certain tax attributes attributable to other 
members. To the extent that, pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section, the excluded COD income is not applied to reduce the tax 
attributes attributable to the member that realizes the excluded COD 
income, after the application of paragraph (a)(3) of this section, such 
amount shall be applied to reduce the remaining consolidated tax 
attributes of the group as provided in section 108 and this section. 
Such amount also shall be applied to reduce the tax attributes 
attributable to members that arose (or are treated as arising) in a 
separate return limitation year to the extent that the member that 
realizes excluded COD income

[[Page 370]]

is a member of the separate return limitation year subgroup with respect 
to such attribute if a SRLY limitation applies to the use of such 
attribute. In addition, such amount shall be applied to reduce the tax 
attributes attributable to members that arose in a separate return year 
or that arose (or are treated as arising) in a separate return 
limitation year if no SRLY limitation applies to the use of such 
attribute. The reduction of each tax attribute pursuant to the three 
preceding sentences shall be made in the order prescribed in section 108 
and pursuant to the principles of Sec. 1.1502-21T(b)(1). Except as 
otherwise provided in this paragraph (a)(4), a tax attribute that arose 
in a separate return year or that arose (or is treated as arising) in a 
separate return limitation year is not subject to reduction pursuant to 
this paragraph (a)(4). Basis in assets is not subject to reduction 
pursuant to this paragraph (a)(4). Finally, to the extent that the 
realization of excluded COD income by a member pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(3) does not reduce a tax attribute attributable to such lower-tier 
member, such excess shall not be applied to reduce tax attributes 
attributable to any member pursuant to this paragraph (a)(4).
    (b) Special rules--(1) Multiple debtor members--(i) Reduction of tax 
attributes attributable to debtor members prior to reduction of 
consolidated tax attributes. If in a single taxable year multiple 
members realize excluded COD income, paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of this 
section shall apply with respect to the excluded COD income of each such 
member prior to the application of paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
    (ii) Reduction of higher-tier debtor's tax attributes. If in a 
single taxable year multiple members realize excluded COD income and one 
such member is a higher-tier member of another such member, paragraphs 
(a)(2) and (3) of this section shall be applied with respect to the 
excluded COD income of the higher-tier member before such paragraphs are 
applied to the excluded COD income of the other such member. A member 
(the first member) is a higher-tier member of another member (the second 
member) if the first member is the common parent or investment 
adjustments under Sec. 1.1502-32 or Sec. 1.1502-32T with respect to 
the stock of the second member would affect investment adjustments with 
respect to the stock of the first member.
    (iii) Reduction of additional tax attributes. If more than one 
member realizes excluded COD income that has not been applied to reduce 
a tax attribute attributable to such member (the remaining COD amount) 
and the remaining tax attributes available for reduction under paragraph 
(a)(4) of this section are less than the aggregate of the remaining COD 
amounts, after the application of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, each 
such member's remaining COD amount shall be applied on a pro rata basis 
(based on the relative remaining COD amounts), pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(4) of this section, to reduce such remaining available tax 
attributes.
    (2) Election under section 108(b)(5). Any member that realizes 
excluded COD income may make the election described in section 
108(b)(5). The election is made separately for each member. Therefore, 
an election may be made for one member that realizes excluded COD income 
(either actually or pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section) while 
another election, or no election, may be made for another member that 
realizes excluded COD income (either actually or pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(3) of this section). See Sec. 1.108-4 for rules relating to the 
procedure for making an election under section 108(b)(5).
    (3) Limitation of section 1017(b)(2). The limitation of section 
1017(b)(2) on the reduction in basis of property shall be applied by 
reference to the aggregate of the basis of the property held by the 
member that realizes excluded COD income, not the aggregate of the basis 
of the property held by all of the members of the group, and the 
liabilities of such member, not the aggregate liabilities of all of the 
members of the group.
    (4) Application of section 1245. Notwithstanding section 
1017(d)(1)(B), a reduction of the basis of subsidiary stock is treated 
as a deduction allowed for depreciation only to the extent that the 
amount by which the basis of the subsidiary stock is reduced exceeds the

[[Page 371]]

total amount of the attributes attributable to such subsidiary that are 
reduced pursuant to the subsidiary's consent under section 1017(b)(3)(D) 
or as a result of the application of paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this 
section.
    (5) Reduction of basis of intercompany obligations. See Sec. 
1.1502-13T(g)(3)(ii)(B)(3) and (4) for special rules related to the 
application of the matching and acceleration rules of Sec. 1.1502-13 
when the basis of an intercompany obligation is reduced pursuant to 
sections 108 and 1017 and paragraph (a)(2) or (3) of this section.
    (6) Taking into account of excess loss account--(i) Determination of 
inclusion. [Reserved]
    (ii) Timing of inclusion. To the extent an excess loss account in a 
share of stock of a subsidiary that realizes excluded COD income is 
required to be taken into account as a result of the application of 
Sec. 1.1502-19(c)(1)(iii)(B), such amount shall be included on the 
group's tax return for the taxable year that includes the date on which 
the subsidiary realizes such excluded COD income.
    (c) Examples. The principles of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section are illustrated by the following examples. Unless otherwise 
indicated, no election under section 108(b)(5) has been made. The 
examples are as follows:

    Example 1. (i) Facts. P is the common parent of a consolidated group 
that includes subsidiaries S1 and S2. P owns 80 percent of the stock of 
S1 and 100 percent of the stock of S2. In Year 1, the P group sustained 
a $250 consolidated net operating loss. Under the principles of Sec. 
1.1502-21T(b)(2)(iv), of that amount, $125 was attributable to P and 
$125 was attributable to S1. On Day 1 of Year 2, S2 joined the P group. 
As of the beginning of Year 2, S2 had a $50 net operating loss carryover 
from Year 1, a separate return limitation year. In Year 2, the P group 
sustained a $200 consolidated net operating loss. Under the principles 
of Sec. 1.1502-21T(b)(2)(iv), of that amount, $90 was attributable to 
P, $70 was attributable to S1, and $40 was attributable to S2. In Year 
3, S2 realized $200 of excluded COD income from the discharge of non-
intercompany indebtedness. After the discharge of this indebtedness, S2 
had no liabilities. In that same year, the P group sustained a $50 
consolidated net operating loss, of which $40 was attributable to S1 and 
$10 was attributable to S2 under the principles of Sec. 1.1502-
21T(b)(2)(iv). As of the beginning of Year 4, S2 had Asset A with a 
basis of $40 and a fair market value of $10.
    (ii) Analysis--(A) Reduction of tax attributes attributable to 
debtor. Pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the tax attributes 
attributable to S2 must first be reduced to take into account its 
excluded COD income in the amount of $200.
    (1) Reduction of net operating losses. Pursuant to section 
108(b)(2)(A), the net operating loss and the net operating loss 
carryovers of S2 are reduced. Pursuant to section 108(b)(4)(B) and 
paragraph (a) of this section, the net operating loss and the net 
operating loss carryovers attributable to S2 under the principles of 
Sec. 1.1502-21T(b)(2)(iv) are reduced first. Accordingly, the 
consolidated net operating loss for Year 3 is reduced by $10, the 
portion of the consolidated net operating loss attributable to S2, to 
$40. Then, again pursuant to section 108(b)(4)(B), S2's net operating 
loss carryover of $50 from its separate return limitation year is 
reduced to $0. Finally, the consolidated net operating loss carryover 
from Year 2 is reduced by $40, the portion of that consolidated net 
operating loss carryover attributable to S2, to $160.
    (2) Reduction of basis. Following the reduction of the net operating 
loss and the net operating loss carryovers attributable to S2, S2 
reduces its basis in its assets pursuant to section 1017 and Sec. 
1.1017-1. Accordingly, S2 reduces its basis in Asset A by $40, from $40 
to $0.
    (B) Reduction of remaining consolidated tax attributes. The 
remaining $60 of excluded COD income then reduces consolidated tax 
attributes pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this section. In particular, 
the remaining $40 consolidated net operating loss for Year 3 is reduced 
to $0. Then, the consolidated net operating loss carryover from Year 1 
is reduced by $20 from $250 to $230. Pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of 
this section, a pro rata amount of the consolidated net operating loss 
carryover from Year 1 that is attributable to each of P and S1 is 
treated as reduced. Therefore, $10 of the consolidated net operating 
loss carryover from Year 1 that is attributable to each of P and S1 is 
treated as reduced.
    Example 2. (i) Facts. P is the common parent of a consolidated group 
that includes subsidiaries S1 and S2. P owns 100 percent of the stock of 
S1 and S1 owns 100 percent of the stock of S2. None of P, S1, or S2 has 
a separate return limitation year. In Year 1, the P group sustained a 
$50 consolidated net operating loss. Under the principles of Sec. 
1.1502-21T(b)(2)(iv), of that amount, $10 was attributable to P, $20 was 
attributable to S1, and $20 was attributable to S2. In Year 2, the P 
group sustained a $70 consolidated net operating loss. Under the 
principles of Sec. 1.1502-21T(b)(2)(iv), of that amount, $30 was 
attributable to P, $30 was attributable to S1, and

[[Page 372]]

$10 was attributable to S2. In Year 3, S1 realized $170 of excluded COD 
income from the discharge of non-intercompany indebtedness. After the 
discharge of this indebtedness, S1 and S2 had no liabilities. In that 
same year, the P group sustained a $50 consolidated net operating loss, 
of which $10 was attributable to S1 and $40 was attributable to S2 under 
the principles of Sec. 1.1502-21T(b)(2)(iv). As of the beginning of 
Year 4, S1's sole asset was the stock of S2, and S1 had a $80 basis in 
the S2 stock. In addition, at the beginning of Year 4, S2 had an asset 
with a $0 basis and a $10 value.
    (ii) Analysis--(A) Reduction of tax attributes attributable to 
debtor. Pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the tax attributes 
attributable to S1 must first be reduced to take into account its 
excluded COD income in the amount of $170.
    (1) Reduction of net operating losses. Pursuant to section 
108(b)(2)(A), the net operating loss and the net operating loss 
carryovers of S1 are reduced. Pursuant to section 108(b)(4)(B) and 
paragraph (a) of this section, the net operating loss and the net 
operating loss carryovers attributable to S1 under the principles of 
Sec. 1.1502-21T(b)(2)(iv) are reduced first. Accordingly, the 
consolidated net operating loss for Year 3 is reduced by $10, the 
portion of the consolidated net operating loss for Year 3 attributable 
to S1, to $40. Then, the consolidated net operating loss carryover from 
Year 1 is reduced by $20, the portion of that consolidated net operating 
loss carryover attributable to S1, to $30, and the consolidated net 
operating loss carryover from Year 2 is reduced by $30, the portion of 
that consolidated net operating loss carryover attributable to S1, to 
$40.
    (2) Reduction of basis. Following the reduction of the net operating 
loss and the net operating loss carryovers attributable to S1, S1 
reduces its basis in its assets pursuant to section 1017 and Sec. 
1.1017-1. Accordingly, S1 reduces its basis in the stock of S2 by $80, 
from $80 to $0.
    (3) Tiering down of stock basis reduction. Pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(3) of this section, for purposes of sections 108 and 1017 and this 
section, S2 is treated as realizing $80 of excluded COD income. 
Accordingly, the consolidated net operating loss for Year 3 is reduced 
by an additional $40, the portion of the consolidated net operating loss 
for Year 3 attributable to S2, to $0. Then, the consolidated net 
operating loss carryover from Year 1 is reduced by $20, the portion of 
that consolidated net operating loss carryover attributable to S2, to 
$10. Then, the consolidated net operating loss carryover from Year 2 is 
reduced by $10, the portion of that consolidated net operating loss 
carryover attributable to S2, to $30. S2's remaining $10 of excluded COD 
income does not reduce consolidated tax attributes attributable to P or 
S1 under paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
    (B) Reduction of remaining consolidated tax attributes. Finally, 
pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this section, S1's remaining $30 of 
excluded COD income reduces the remaining consolidated tax attributes. 
In particular, the remaining $10 consolidated net operating loss 
carryover from Year 1 is reduced by $10 to $0, and the remaining $30 
consolidated net operating loss carryover from Year 2 is reduced by $20 
to $10.
    Example 3. (i) Facts. P is the common parent of a consolidated group 
that includes subsidiaries S1, S2, and S3. P owns 100 percent of the 
stock of S1, S1 owns 100 percent of the stock of S2, and S2 owns 100 
percent of the stock of S3. In Year 1, the P group sustained a $150 
consolidated net operating loss. Under the principles of Sec. 1.1502-
21T(b)(2)(iv), of that amount, $50 was attributable to S2, and $100 was 
attributable to S3. In Year 2, the P group sustained a $50 consolidated 
net operating loss. Under the principles of Sec. 1.1502-21T(b)(2)(iv), 
of that amount, $40 was attributable to S1 and $10 was attributable to 
S2. In Year 3, S1 realized $170 of excluded COD income from the 
discharge of non-intercompany indebtedness. After the discharge of this 
indebtedness, S1, S2, and S3 had no liabilities. In that same year, the 
P group sustained a $50 consolidated net operating loss, of which $10 
was attributable to S1, $20 was attributable to S2, and $20 was 
attributable to S3 under the principles of Sec. 1.1502-21T(b)(2)(iv). 
At the beginning of Year 4, S1's only asset was the stock of S2, with a 
basis of $120, and S2's only asset was the stock of S3 with a basis of 
$180 and a value of $10. None of P, S1, or S2 had a separate return 
limitation year.
    (ii) Analysis--Reduction of tax attributes attributable to debtor. 
Pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the tax attributes 
attributable to S1 must first be reduced to take into account its 
excluded COD income in the amount of $170.
    (A) Reduction of net operating losses. Pursuant to section 
108(b)(2)(A), the net operating loss and the net operating loss 
carryovers of S1 are reduced. Pursuant to section 108(b)(4)(B) and 
paragraph (a) of this section, the net operating loss and the net 
operating loss carryovers attributable to S1 under the principles of 
Sec. 1.1502-21T(b)(2)(iv) are reduced first. Pursuant to section 
108(b)(4)(B), S1's net operating loss for the taxable year of the 
discharge is reduced first. Accordingly, the consolidated net operating 
loss for Year 3 is reduced by $10, the portion of the consolidated net 
operating loss attributable to S1, to $40. Then, again pursuant to 
section 108(b)(4)(B), the consolidated net operating loss carryover from 
Year 2 is reduced by $40, the portion of that consolidated net operating 
loss carryover attributable to S1, to $10.

[[Page 373]]

    (B) Reduction of basis. Following the reduction of the net operating 
loss and the net operating loss carryovers attributable to S1, S1 
reduces its basis in its assets pursuant to section 1017 and Sec. 
1.1017-1. Accordingly, S1 reduces its basis in the stock of S2 by $120, 
from $120 to $0.
    (C) Tiering down of stock basis reduction to S2. Pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(3) of this section, for purposes of sections 108 and 1017 
and this section, S2 is treated as realizing $120 of excluded COD 
income. Pursuant to section 108(b)(2)(A), therefore, the net operating 
loss and net operating loss carryovers of S2 are reduced. Pursuant to 
section 108(b)(4)(B) and paragraph (a) of this section, the net 
operating loss and the net operating loss carryovers attributable to S2 
under the principles of Sec. 1.1502-21T(b)(2)(iv) are reduced. Pursuant 
to section 108(b)(4)(B), S2's net operating loss for the taxable year of 
the discharge is reduced. Accordingly, the consolidated net operating 
loss for Year 3 is further reduced by $20, the portion of the 
consolidated net operating loss attributable to S2, to $20. Then, again 
pursuant to section 108(b)(4)(B), the consolidated net operating loss 
carryover from Year 1 is reduced by $50, the portion of that 
consolidated net operating loss carryover attributable to S2, to $100. 
Then, again pursuant to section 108(b)(4)(B), the consolidated net 
operating loss carryover from Year 2 is further reduced by $10, the 
portion of that consolidated net operating loss carryover attributable 
to S2, to $0. Following the reduction of the net operating loss and the 
net operating loss carryovers attributable to S2, S2 reduces its basis 
in its assets pursuant to section 1017 and Sec. 1.1017-1. Accordingly, 
S2 reduces its basis in its S3 stock by $40 to $140.
    (D) Tiering down of stock basis reduction to S3. Pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(3) of this section, for purposes of sections 108 and 1017 
and this section, S3 is treated as realizing $40 of excluded COD income. 
Pursuant to section 108(b)(2)(A), therefore, the net operating loss and 
the net operating loss carryovers of S3 are reduced. Pursuant to section 
108(b)(4)(B) and paragraph (a) of this section, the net operating loss 
and the net operating loss carryovers attributable to S3 under the 
principles of Sec. 1.1502-21T(b)(2)(iv) are reduced. Pursuant to 
section 108(b)(4)(B), S3's net operating loss for the taxable year of 
the discharge is reduced. Accordingly, the consolidated net operating 
loss for Year 3 is further reduced by $20, the portion of the 
consolidated net operating loss attributable to S3, to $0. Then, again 
pursuant to section 108(b)(4)(B), the consolidated net operating loss 
carryover from Year 1 is reduced by $20, the lesser of the portion of 
that consolidated net operating loss carryover attributable to S3 and 
the remaining excluded COD income, to $80.
    Example 4. (i) Facts. P is the common parent of a consolidated group 
that includes subsidiaries S1, S2, and S3. P owns 100 percent of the 
stock of each of S1 and S2. Each of S1 and S2 owns stock of S3 that 
represents 50 percent of the value of the stock of S3. In Year 1, the P 
group sustained a $160 consolidated net operating loss. Under the 
principles of Sec. 1.1502-21T(b)(2)(iv), of that amount, $10 was 
attributable to P, $50 was attributable to S2, and $100 was attributable 
to S3. In Year 2, the P group sustained a $110 consolidated net 
operating loss. Under the principles of Sec. 1.1502-21T(b)(2)(iv), of 
that amount, $40 was attributable to S1 and $70 was attributable to S2. 
In Year 3, S1 realized $200 of excluded COD income from the discharge of 
non-intercompany indebtedness, and S2 realized $270 of excluded COD 
income from the discharge of non-intercompany indebtedness. After the 
discharge of this indebtedness, S1, S2, and S3 had no liabilities. In 
that same year, the P group sustained a $50 consolidated net operating 
loss, of which $10 was attributable to S1, $20 was attributable to S2, 
and $20 was attributable to S3 under the principles of Sec. 1.1502-
21T(b)(2)(iv). At the beginning of Year 4, S1's basis in its S3 stock 
was $60, S2's basis in its S3 stock was $120, and S3 had one asset with 
a basis of $200 and a value of $10. None of P, S1, S2, or S3 had a 
separate return limitation year.
    (ii) Analysis--Reduction of tax attributes attributable to debtors. 
Pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, the tax attributes 
attributable to each of S1 and S2 are reduced pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section, and the tax attributes attributable to S3 are 
reduced pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section so as to reflect a 
reduction of S1's and S2's basis in the stock of S3 prior to the 
application of paragraph (a)(4) to reduce additional tax attributes. 
Pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the tax attributes 
attributable to S1 and S2 must be reduced to take into account their 
excluded COD income.
    (A) Reduction of net operating losses generally. Pursuant to section 
108(b)(2)(A), the net operating losses and the net operating loss 
carryovers of S1 and S2 are reduced. Pursuant to section 108(b)(4)(B) 
and paragraph (a) of this section, the net operating losses and the net 
operating loss carryovers attributable to S1 and S2 under the principles 
of Sec. 1.1502-21T(b)(2)(iv) are reduced first.
    (B) Reduction of net operating losses attributable to S1. Pursuant 
to section 108(b)(4)(B), S1's net operating loss for the taxable year of 
the discharge is reduced. Accordingly, the consolidated net operating 
loss for Year 3 is reduced by $10, the portion of the consolidated net 
operating loss attributable to S1, to $40. Then, again pursuant to 
section 108(b)(4)(B), the consolidated net operating loss carryover from 
Year 2 is reduced by $40,

[[Page 374]]

the portion of that consolidated net operating loss carryover 
attributable to S1, to $70.
    (C) Reduction of net operating losses attributable to S2. Pursuant 
to section 108(b)(4)(B), S2's net operating loss for the taxable year of 
the discharge is reduced. Accordingly, the consolidated net operating 
loss for Year 3 is further reduced by $20, the portion of the 
consolidated net operating loss attributable to S2, to $20. Then, 
pursuant to section 108(b)(4)(B), the consolidated net operating loss 
carryover from Year 1 is reduced by $50, the portion of that 
consolidated net operating loss carryover attributable to S2, to $110. 
Then, again pursuant to section 108(b)(4)(B), the consolidated net 
operating loss carryover from Year 2 is further reduced by $70, the 
portion of that consolidated net operating loss carryover attributable 
to S2, to $0.
    (D) Reduction of basis. Following the reduction of the net operating 
losses and the net operating loss carryovers attributable to S1 and S2, 
S1 and S2 must reduce their basis in their assets pursuant to section 
1017 and Sec. 1.1017-1. Accordingly, S1 reduces its basis in the stock 
of S3 by $60, from $60 to $0, and S2 reduces its basis in the stock of 
S3 by $120, from $120 to $0.
    (E) Tiering down of basis reduction. Pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of 
this section, for purposes of sections 108 and 1017 and this section, S3 
is treated as realizing $180 of excluded COD income. Pursuant to section 
108(b)(2)(A), therefore, the net operating loss and the net operating 
loss carryovers of S3 are reduced, in the order indicated by section 
108(b)(4)(B). Pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section the 
consolidated net operating loss and any consolidated net operating loss 
carryovers that are attributable to S3 under the principles of Sec. 
1.1502-21T(b)(2)(iv) are reduced. Accordingly, the consolidated net 
operating loss for Year 3 is further reduced by $20, the portion of the 
consolidated net operating loss attributable to S3, to $0. Then, the 
consolidated net operating loss carryover from Year 1 is reduced by 
$100, the portion of that consolidated net operating loss carryover 
attributable to S3, to $10. Following the reduction of the net operating 
loss and the net operating loss carryover attributable to S3, S3 reduces 
its basis in its asset pursuant to section 1017 and Sec. 1.1017-1. 
Accordingly, S3 reduces its basis in its asset by $60, from $200 to 
$140.
    (F) Reduction of remaining consolidated tax attributes. Finally, 
pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the remaining $90 of S1's 
excluded COD income and the remaining $10 of S2's excluded COD income 
reduce the remaining consolidated tax attributes. In particular, the 
remaining $10 consolidated net operating loss carryover from Year 1 is 
reduced by $10 to $0. Because that amount is less than the aggregate 
amount of remaining excluded COD income, such income is applied on a pro 
rata basis to reduce the remaining consolidated tax attributes. 
Accordingly, $9 of S1's remaining excluded COD income and $1 of S2's 
remaining excluded COD income is applied to reduce the remaining 
consolidated net operating loss carryover from Year 1. Consequently, of 
S1's excluded COD income of $200, only $119 is applied to reduce tax 
attributes, and, of S2's excluded COD income of $270, only $261 is 
applied to reduce tax attributes.

    (d) Effective dates. (1) This section, other than paragraphs (a)(4), 
(b)(4), (b)(5), and (b)(6) of this section, applies to discharges of 
indebtedness that occur after August 29, 2003.
    (2) Paragraph (a)(4) of this section applies to discharges of 
indebtedness that occur after August 29, 2003, but only if the discharge 
occurs during a taxable year the original return for which is due 
(without regard to extensions) after December 11, 2003. However, groups 
may apply paragraph (a)(4) of this section to discharges of indebtedness 
that occur after August 29, 2003, and during a taxable year the original 
return for which is due (without regard to extensions) on or before 
December 11, 2003. For discharges of indebtedness that occur after 
August 29, 2003, and during a taxable year the original return for which 
is due (without regard to extensions) on or before December 11, 2003, 
paragraph (a)(4) of this section shall apply as in effect on August 29, 
2003.
    (3) Paragraphs (b)(4), (b)(5), and (b)(6)(ii) of this section apply 
to discharges of indebtedness that occur after August 29, 2003, but only 
if the discharge occurs during a taxable year the original return for 
which is due (without regard to extensions) after March 12, 2004. 
However, groups may apply paragraphs (b)(4), (b)(5), and (b)(6) of this 
section to discharges of indebtedness that occur after August 29, 2003, 
and during a taxable year the original return for which is due (without 
regard to extensions) on or before March 12, 2004.

         Basis, Stock Ownership, and Earnings and Profits Rules


<R05>
Sec. 1.1502-30  Stock basis after certain triangular reorganizations.

    (a) Scope. This section provides rules for determining the basis of 
the stock of an acquiring corporation as a result of a triangular 
reorganization. The definitions and nomenclature contained in Sec. 
1.358-6 apply to this section.
    (b) General rules--(1) Forward triangular merger, triangular C 
reorganization, or triangular B reorganization. P adjusts its basis in 
the stock of S as a result of a forward triangular merger, triangular C 
reorganization, or triangular B reorganization under Sec. 1.358-6(c) 
and (d), except that Sec. 1.358-6 (c)(1)(ii) and (d)(2) do not apply. 
Instead, P adjusts such basis by taking into account the full amount 
of--
    (i) T liabilities assumed by S or the amount of liabilities to which 
the T assets acquired by S are subject, and
    (ii) The fair market value of any consideration not provided by P 
pursuant to the plan of reorganization.
    (2) Reverse triangular merger. If P adjusts its basis in the T stock 
acquired as a result of a reverse triangular merger under Sec. 1.358-6 
(c)(2)(i) and (d), Sec. 1.358-6 (c)(1)(ii) and (d)(2) do not apply. 
Instead, P adjusts such basis by taking into account the full amount 
of--
    (i) T liabilities deemed assumed by S or the amount of liabilities 
to which the T assets deemed acquired by S are subject, and
    (ii) The fair market value of any consideration not provided by P 
pursuant to the plan of reorganization.
    (3) Excess loss accounts. Negative adjustments under this section 
may exceed P's basis in its S or T stock. The resulting negative amount 
is P's excess loss account in its S or T stock. See Sec. 1.1502-19 for 
rules treating excess loss accounts as negative basis, and treating 
references to stock basis as including references to excess loss 
accounts.
    (4) Application of other rules of law. The rules for this section 
are in addition to other rules of law. See Sec. 1.1502-80(d) for the 
non-application of section 357(c) to P.
    (5) Examples. The rules of this paragraph (b) are illustrated by the 
following examples. For purposes of these examples, P, S, and T are 
domestic corporations, P and S file consolidated returns, P owns all of 
the only class of S stock, the P stock exchanged in the transaction 
satisfies the requirements of the applicable triangular reorganization 
provisions, the facts set forth the only corporate activity, and tax 
liabilities are disregarded.

    Example 1. Liabilities. (a) Facts. T has assets with an aggregate 
basis of $60 and fair market value of $100. T's assets are subject to 
$70 of liabilities. Pursuant to a plan, P forms S with $5 of cash (which 
S retains), and T merges into S. In the merger, the T shareholders 
receive P stock worth $30 in exchange for their T stock. The transaction 
is a reorganization to which sections 368 (a)(1)(A) and (a)(2)(D) apply.
    (b) Basis adjustment. Under Sec. 1.358-6, P adjusts its $5 basis in 
the S stock as if P had acquired the T assets with a carryover basis 
under section 362 and transferred these assets to S in a transaction in 
which P determines its basis in the S stock under section 358. Under the 
rules of this section, the limitation described in Sec. 1.358-
6(c)(1)(ii) does not apply. Thus, P adjusts its basis in the S stock by 
-$10 (the aggregate adjusted basis of T's assets decreased by the amount 
of liabilities to which the T assets are subject). Consequently, as a 
result of the reorganization, P has an excess loss account of $5 in its 
S stock.
    Example 2. Consideration not provided by P. (a) Facts. T has assets 
with an aggregate basis of $10 and fair market value of $100 and no 
liabilities. S is an operating company with substantial assets that has 
been in existence for several years. P has a $5 basis in its S stock. 
Pursuant to a plan, T merges into S and the T shareholders receive $70 
of P stock provided by P pursuant to the plan of reorganization and $30 
of cash provided by S in exchange for their T stock. The transaction is 
a reorganization to which sections 368 (a)(1)(A) and (a)(2)(D) apply.
    (b) Basis adjustment. Under Sec. 1.358-6, P adjusts its $5 basis in 
the S stock as if P had acquired the T assets with a carryover basis 
under section 362 and transferred these assets to S in a transaction in 
which P determines its basis in the S stock under section 358. Under the 
rules of this section, the limitation described in Sec. 1.358-6(d)(2) 
does not apply. Thus, P adjusts its basis in the S stock by -$20 (the 
aggregate adjusted basis of T's assets decreased by the fair market 
value of the consideration provided by S). As a result of the 
reorganization, P has an excess loss account of $15 in its S stock.
    (c) Appreciated asset. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of 
this Example 2, except that in the reorganization S provides an asset 
with a $20 adjusted basis and $30 fair

[[Page 376]]

market value instead of $30 cash. The basis is adjusted in the same 
manner as in paragraph (b) of this Example 2. In addition, because S 
recognizes a $10 gain from the asset under section 1001, P's basis in 
its S stock is increased under Sec. 1.1502-32(b) by S's $10 gain. 
Consequently, as a result of the reorganization, P has an excess loss 
account of $5 in its S stock. (The results would be the same if the 
appreciated asset provided by S was P stock with respect to which S 
recognized gain. See Sec. 1.1032-2(c)).
    Example 3. Reverse triangular merger. (a) Facts. T has assets with 
an aggregate basis of $60 and fair market value of $100. T's assets are 
subject to $70 of liabilities. P owns all of the only class of S stock. 
P has a $5 basis in its S stock. Pursuant to a plan, S merges into T 
with T surviving. In the merger, the T shareholders exchange their T 
stock for $2 cash from P and $28 worth of P stock provided by P pursuant 
to the plan. The transaction is a reorganization to which sections 368 
(a)(1)(A) and (a)(2)(E) apply.
    (b) Basis adjustment. Under Sec. 1.358-6, P's basis in the T stock 
acquired equals its $5 basis in its S stock immediately before the 
transaction adjusted by the $60 basis in the T assets deemed 
transferred, and the $70 of liabilities to which the T assets are 
subject. Under the rules of this section, the limitation described in 
Sec. 1.358-6(c)(1)(ii) does not apply. Consequently, P has an excess 
loss account of $5 in its T stock as a result of the transaction.

    (c) Effective date. This section applies to reorganizations 
occurring on or after December 21, 1995.

[T.D. 8648, 60 FR 66082, Dec. 21, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 1.1502-31  Stock basis after a group structure change.

    (a) In general--(1) Overview. If one corporation (P) succeeds 
another corporation (T) under the principles of Sec. 1.1502-75(d) (2) 
or (3) as the common parent of a consolidated group in a group structure 
change, the basis of members in the stock of the former common parent 
(or the stock of a successor) is adjusted or determined under this 
section. See Sec. 1.1502-33(f)(1) for the definition of group structure 
change. For example, if P owns all of the stock of another corporation 
(S), and T merges into S in a group structure change that is a 
reorganization described in section 368(a)(2)(D) in which P becomes the 
common parent of the T group, P's basis in S's stock must be adjusted to 
reflect the change in S's assets and liabilities. The rules of this 
section coordinate with the earnings and profits adjustments required 
under Sec. 1.1502-33(f)(1), generally conforming the results of 
transactions in which the T group continues under Sec. 1.1502-75 with P 
as the common parent. By preserving in P the relationship between T's 
earnings and profits and asset basis, these adjustments limit possible 
distortions under section 1502 (e.g., in the deconsolidation rules for 
earnings and profits under Sec. 1.1502-33(e), and the continued filing 
requirements under Sec. 1.1502-75(a)). This section applies whether or 
not T continues to exist after the group structure change.
    (2) Application of other rules of law. The rules of this section are 
in addition to other rules of law. The provisions of this section and 
other rules of law must not have the effect of duplicating an amount in 
P's basis in S's stock.
    (b) General rules. Except as otherwise provided in this section--
    (1) Asset acquisitions. If a corporation acquires the former common 
parent's assets (and any liabilities assumed or to which the assets are 
subject) in a group structure change, the basis of members in the stock 
of the acquiring corporation is adjusted immediately after the group 
structure change to reflect the acquiring corporation's allocable share 
of the former common parent's net asset basis as determined under 
paragraph (c) of this section. For example, if S acquires all of T's 
assets in a group structure change that is a reorganization described in 
section 368(a)(2)(D), P's basis in S's stock is adjusted to reflect T's 
net asset basis. If P owned some of T's stock before the group structure 
change, the results would be the same because P's basis in the T stock 
is not taken into account in determining P's basis in S's stock. If T's 
net asset basis is a negative amount, it reduces P's basis in S's stock 
and, if the reduction exceeds P's basis in S's stock, the excess is P's 
excess loss account in S's stock. See Sec. 1.1502-19 for rules treating 
P's excess loss account as negative basis, and treating a reference to 
P's basis in S's stock as including an excess loss account.
    (2) Stock acquisitions. If a corporation acquires stock of the 
former common parent in a group structure change, the

[[Page 377]]

basis of the members in the former common parent's stock immediately 
after the group structure change (including any stock of the former 
common parent owned before the group structure change) is redetermined 
in accordance with the results for an asset acquisition described in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section. For example, if all of T's stock is 
contributed to P in a group structure change to which section 351 
applies, P's basis in T's stock is T's net asset basis, rather than the 
amount determined under section 362. Similarly, if S merges into T in a 
group structure change described in section 368(a)(2)(E), P's basis in 
T's stock is the basis that P would have in S's stock under paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section if T had merged into S in a group structure 
change described in section 368(a)(2)(D).
    (c) Net asset basis. The former common parent's net asset basis is 
the basis it would have in the stock of a newly formed subsidiary, if--
    (1) The former common parent transferred its assets (and any 
liabilities assumed or to which the assets are subject) to the 
subsidiary in a transaction to which section 351 applies;
    (2) The former common parent and the subsidiary were members of the 
same consolidated group (see Sec. 1.1502-80(d) for the non-application 
of section 357(c) to the transfer); and
    (3) The asset basis taken into account is each asset's basis 
immediately after the group structure change (e.g., taking into account 
any income or gain recognized in the group structure change and 
reflected in the asset's basis).
    (d) Additional adjustments. In addition to the adjustments in 
paragraph (b) of this section, the following adjustments are made:
    (1) Consideration not provided by P. The basis is reduced to reflect 
the fair market value of any consideration not provided by the member. 
For example, if S acquires T's assets in a group structure change 
described in section 368(a)(2)(D), and S provides an appreciated asset 
(e.g., stock of P) as partial consideration in the transaction, P's 
basis in S's stock is reduced by the fair market value of the asset.
    (2) Allocable share--(i) Asset acquisitions. If a corporation 
receives less than all of the former common parent's assets and 
liabilities in the group structure change, the former common parent's 
net asset basis taken into account under paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section is adjusted accordingly.
    (ii) Stock acquisitions. If a corporation owns less than all of the 
former common parent's stock immediately after a group structure change 
described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the percentage of the 
former common parent's net asset basis taken into account equals the 
percentage (by fair market value) of the former common parent's stock 
owned immediately after the group structure change. For example, if P 
owns less than all of the former common parent's stock immediately after 
the group structure change, only an allocable part of the basis 
determined under this section is reflected in the shares owned by P (and 
the amount allocable to shares owned by nonmembers has no effect on the 
basis of their shares).
    (3) Allocation among shares of stock. The basis determined under 
this section is allocated among shares under the principles of section 
358. For example, if P owns multiple classes of the former common 
parent's stock immediately after the group structure change, only an 
allocable part of the basis determined under this section is reflected 
in the basis of each share. See Sec. 1.1502-19(d), for special 
allocations with respect to excess loss accounts.
    (4) Higher-tier members. To the extent that the former common parent 
is owned by members other than the new common parent, the basis of 
members in the stock of all subsidiaries owning, directly or indirectly, 
in whole or in part, an interest in the former common parent's assets or 
liabilities is adjusted in accordance with the principles of this 
section. The adjustments are applied in the order of the tiers, from the 
lowest to the highest.
    (e) Waiver of loss carryovers of former common parent --(1) General 
rule. An irrevocable election may be made to treat all or any portion of 
a loss carryover attributable to the common parent as expiring for all 
Federal income tax purposes immediately before the

[[Page 378]]

group structure change. Thus, if the loss carryover is treated as 
expiring under the election, it will not result in a negative adjustment 
to the basis of P's stock under Sec. 1.1502-32(b).
    (2) Election. The election described in this paragraph (e) must be 
made in a separate statement entitled ``ELECTION TO TREAT LOSS CARRYOVER 
AS EXPIRING UNDER Sec. 1.1502-31(e).'' The statement must be filed with 
the consolidated group's return for the year that includes the group 
structure change, and it must be signed by the former and the new common 
parent. The statement must identify the amount of each loss carryover 
deemed to expire (or the amount of each loss carryover deemed not to 
expire, with any balance of any loss carryovers being deemed to expire).
    (f) Predecessors and successors. For purposes of this section, any 
reference to a corporation includes a reference to a successor or 
predecessor as the context may require. See Sec. 1.1502-32(f) for 
definitions of predecessor and successor.
    (g) Examples. For purposes of the examples in this section, unless 
otherwise stated, all corporations have only one class of stock 
outstanding, the tax year of all persons is the calendar year, all 
persons use the accrual method of accounting, the facts set forth the 
only corporate activity, all transactions are between unrelated persons, 
and tax liabilities are disregarded. The principles of this section are 
illustrated by the following examples.

    Example 1. Forward triangular merger. (a) Facts. P is the common 
parent of one group and T is the common parent of another. T has assets 
with an aggregate basis of $60 and fair market value of $100 and no 
liabilities. T's shareholders have an aggregate basis of $50 in T's 
stock. In Year 1, pursuant to a plan, P forms S and T merges into S with 
the T shareholders receiving $100 of P stock in exchange for their T 
stock. The transaction is a reorganization described in section 
368(a)(2)(D). The transaction is also a reverse acquisition under Sec. 
1.1502- 75(d)(3) because the T shareholders, as a result of owning T's 
stock, own more than 50% of the value of P's stock immediately after the 
transaction. Thus, the transaction is a group structure change under 
Sec. 1.1502-33(f)(1), and P's earnings and profits are adjusted to 
reflect T's earnings and profits immediately before T ceases to be the 
common parent of the T group.
    (b) Analysis. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, P's basis in 
S's stock is adjusted to reflect T's net asset basis. Under paragraph 
(c) of this section, T's net asset basis is $60, the basis T would have 
in the stock of a subsidiary under section 358 if T had transferred all 
of its assets and liabilities to the subsidiary in a transaction to 
which section 351 applies. Thus, P has a $60 basis in S's stock.
    (c) Pre-existing S. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of 
this Example 1, except that P has owned the stock of S for several years 
and P has a $50 basis in the S stock before the merger with T. Under 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, P's $50 basis in S's stock is adjusted 
to reflect T's net asset basis. Thus, P's basis in S's stock is $110 
($50 plus $60).
    (d) Excess loss account included in former common parent's net asset 
basis. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this Example 1, 
except that T has two assets, an operating asset with an $80 basis and 
$90 fair market value, and stock of a subsidiary with a $20 excess loss 
account and $10 fair market value. Under paragraph (c) of this section, 
T's net asset basis is $60 ($80 minus $20). See sections 351 and 358, 
and Sec. 1.1502-19. Consequently, P has a $60 basis in S's stock. Under 
section 362 and Sec. 1.1502-19, S has an $80 basis in the operating 
asset and a $20 excess loss account in the stock of the subsidiary.
    (e) Liabilities in excess of basis. The facts are the same as in 
paragraph (a) of this Example 1, except that T's assets have a fair 
market value of $170 (and $60 basis) and are subject to $70 of 
liabilities. Under paragraph (c) of this section, T's net asset basis is 
($10) ($60 minus $70). See sections 351 and 358, and Sec. Sec. 1.1502-
19 and 1.1502-80(d). Thus, P has a $10 excess loss account in S's stock. 
Under section 362, S has a $60 basis in its assets (which are subject to 
$70 of liabilities). (Under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, because 
the liabilities are taken into account in determining net asset basis 
under paragraph (c) of this section, the liabilities are not also taken 
into account as consideration not provided by P under paragraph (d)(1) 
of this section.)
    (f) Consideration provided by S. The facts are the same as in 
paragraph (a) of this Example 1, except that P forms S with a $100 
contribution at the beginning of Year 1, and during Year 6, pursuant to 
a plan, S purchases $100 of P stock and T merges into S with the T 
shareholders receiving P stock in exchange for their T stock. Under 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, P's $100 basis in S's stock is 
increased by $60 to reflect T's net asset basis. Under paragraph (d)(1) 
of this section, P's basis in S's stock is decreased by $100 (the fair 
market value of the P stock) because the P stock purchased by S and used 
in the

[[Page 379]]

transaction is consideration not provided by P.
    (g) Appreciated asset provided by S. The facts are the same as in 
paragraph (a) of this Example 1, except that P has owned the stock of S 
for several years, and the shareholders of T receive $60 of P stock and 
an asset of S with a $30 adjusted basis and $40 fair market value. S 
recognizes a $10 gain from the asset under section 1001. Under paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section, P's basis in S's stock is increased by $60 to 
reflect T's net asset basis. Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, P's 
basis in S's stock is decreased by $40 (the fair market value of the 
asset provided by S). In addition, P's basis in S's stock is increased 
under Sec. 1.1502-32(b) by S's $10 gain.
    (h) Depreciated asset provided by S. The facts are the same as in 
paragraph (a) of this Example 1, except that P has owned the stock of S 
for several years, and the shareholders of T receive $60 of P stock and 
an asset of S with a $50 adjusted basis and $40 fair market value. S 
recognizes a $10 loss from the asset under section 1001. Under paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section, P's basis in S's stock is increased by $60 to 
reflect T's net asset basis. Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, P's 
basis in S's stock is decreased by $40 (the fair market value of the 
asset provided by S). In addition, S's $10 loss is taken into account 
under Sec. 1.1502-32(b) in determining P's basis adjustments under that 
section.
    Example 2. Stock acquisition. (a) Facts. P is the common parent of 
one group and T is the common parent of another. T has assets with an 
aggregate basis of $60 and fair market value of $100 and no liabilities. 
T's shareholders have an aggregate basis of $50 in T's stock. Pursuant 
to a plan, P forms S and S acquires all of T's stock in exchange for P 
stock in a transaction described in section 368(a)(1)(B). The 
transaction is also a reverse acquisition under Sec. 1.1502-75(d)(3). 
Thus, the transaction is a group structure change under Sec. 1.1502-
33(f)(1), and the earnings and profits of P and S are adjusted to 
reflect T's earnings and profits immediately before T ceases to be the 
common parent of the T group.
    (b) Analysis. Under paragraph (d)(4) of this section, although S is 
not the new common parent of the T group, adjustments must be made to 
S's basis in T's stock in accordance with the principles of this 
section. Although S's basis in T's stock would ordinarily be determined 
under section 362 by reference to the basis of T's shareholders in T's 
stock immediately before the group structure change, under the 
principles of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, S's basis in T's stock 
is determined by reference to T's net asset basis. Thus, S's basis in 
T's stock is $60.
    (c) Higher-tier adjustments. Under paragraph (d)(4) of this section, 
P's basis in S's stock is adjusted to $60 (to be consistent with the 
adjustment to S's basis in T's stock).
    (d) Cross ownership. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of 
this Example 2, except that S has owned 10% of T's stock for several 
years and, pursuant to the plan, S acquires the remaining 90% of T's 
stock in exchange for P stock. The results are the same as in paragraphs 
(b) and (c) of this Example 2, because S's basis in the initial 10% of 
T's stock is redetermined under this section.
    (e) Allocable share. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of 
this Example 2, except that P owns only 90% of S's stock immediately 
after the group structure change. S's basis in T's stock is the same as 
in paragraph (b) of this Example 2. Under paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section, P's basis in its S stock is adjusted to $54 (90% of S's $60 
adjustment).
    Example 3. Taxable stock acquisition. (a) Facts. P is the common 
parent of one group and T is the common parent of another. T has assets 
with an aggregate basis of $60 and fair market value of $100 and no 
liabilities. T's shareholders have an aggregate basis of $50 in T's 
stock. Pursuant to a plan, P acquires all of T's stock in exchange for 
$70 of P's stock and $30 in a transaction that is a group structure 
change under Sec. 1.1502-33(f)(1). P's acquisition of T's stock is a 
taxable transaction. (Because of P's use of cash, the acquisition is not 
a transaction described in section 368(a)(1)(B).)
    (b) Analysis. Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, P's basis in 
T's stock is adjusted to reflect T's net asset basis. Thus, although P's 
basis in T's stock would ordinarily be a cost basis of $100, P's basis 
in T's stock under this section is $60.

    (h) Effective date--(1) General rule. This section applies to group 
structure changes occurring in consolidated return years beginning on or 
after January 1, 1995.
    (2) Prior law. For prior years, see prior regulations under section 
1502 as in effect with respect to the transaction. See, e.g., Sec. 
1.1502-31T as contained in the 26 CFR part 1 edition revised as of April 
1, 1994.

[T.D. 8560, 59 FR 41683, Aug. 15, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 1.1502-32  Investment adjustments.

    (a) In general--(1) Purpose. This section provides rules for 
adjusting the basis of the stock of a subsidiary (S) owned by another 
member (P). These rules modify the determination of P's basis in S's 
stock under applicable rules of law by adjusting P's basis to reflect 
S's distributions and S's items of income, gain, deduction, and loss 
taken into account for the period that S is a member of the consolidated

[[Page 380]]

group. The purpose of the adjustments is to treat P and S as a single 
entity so that consolidated taxable income reflects the group's income. 
For example, if P forms S with a $100 contribution, and S takes into 
account $10 of income, P's $100 basis in S's stock under section 358 is 
increased by $10 under this section to prevent S's income from being 
taken into account a second time on P's disposition of S's stock. 
Comparable adjustments are made for tax-exempt income and noncapital, 
nondeductible expenses that S takes into account, to preserve their 
treatment under the Internal Revenue Code.
    (2) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1502-32T(a)(2).
    (3) Overview--(i) In general. The amount of the stock basis 
adjustments and their timing are determined under paragraph (b) of this 
section. Under paragraph (c) of this section, the amount of the 
adjustment is allocated among the shares of S's stock. Paragraphs (d) 
through (g) of this section provide definitions, an anti-avoidance rule, 
successor rules, and recordkeeping requirements.
    (ii) Excess loss account. Negative adjustments under this section 
may exceed P's basis in S's stock. The resulting negative amount is P's 
excess loss account in S's stock. See Sec. 1.1502-19 for rules treating 
excess loss accounts as negative basis, and treating references to stock 
basis as including references to excess loss accounts.
    (iii) Tiering up of adjustments. The adjustments to S's stock under 
this section are taken into account in determining adjustments to 
higher-tier stock. The adjustments are applied in the order of the 
tiers, from the lowest to the highest. For example, if P is also a 
subsidiary, P's adjustment to S's stock is taken into account in 
determining the adjustments to stock of P owned by other members.
    (b) Stock basis adjustments--(1) Timing of adjustments--(i) In 
general. Adjustments under this section are made as of the close of each 
consolidated return year, and as of any other time (an interim 
adjustment) if a determination at that time is necessary to determine a 
tax liability of any person. For example, adjustments are made as of P's 
sale of S's stock in order to measure P's gain or loss from the sale, 
and if P's interest in S's stock is not uniform throughout the year 
(e.g., because P disposes of a portion of its S stock, or S issues 
additional shares to another person), the adjustments under this section 
are made by taking into account the varying interests. An interim 
adjustment may be necessary even if tax liability is not affected until 
a later time. For example, if P sells only 50% of S's stock and S 
becomes a nonmember, adjustments must be made for the retained stock as 
of the disposition (whether or not P has an excess loss account in that 
stock). Similarly, if S liquidates during a consolidated return year, 
adjustments must be made as of the liquidation (even if the liquidation 
is tax free under section 332).
    (ii) Allocation of items. If Sec. 1.1502-76(b) applies to S for 
purposes of an adjustment before the close of the group's consolidated 
return year, the amount of the adjustment is determined under that 
section. If Sec. 1.1502-76(b) does not apply to the interim adjustment, 
the adjustment is determined under the principles of Sec. 1.1502-76(b), 
consistently applied, and ratable allocation under the principles of 
Sec. 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii) or (iii) may be used without filing an 
election under Sec. 1.1502-76(b)(2). The principles would apply, for 
example, if P becomes a nonmember but S remains a member.
    (2) Amount of adjustments. P's basis in S's stock is increased by 
positive adjustments and decreased by negative adjustments under this 
paragraph (b)(2). The amount of the adjustment, determined as of the 
time of the adjustment, is the net amount of S's--
    (i) Taxable income or loss;
    (ii) Tax-exempt income;
    (iii) Noncapital, nondeductible expenses; and
    (iv) Distributions with respect to S's stock.
    (3) Operating rules. For purposes of determining P's adjustments to 
the basis of S's stock under paragraph (b)(2) of this section--
    (i) Taxable income or loss. S's taxable income or loss is 
consolidated taxable income (or loss) determined by including only S's 
items of income, gain, deduction, and loss taken into account in

[[Page 381]]

determining consolidated taxable income (or loss), treating S's 
deductions and losses as taken into account to the extent they are 
absorbed by S or any other member. For this purpose:
    (A) To the extent that S's deduction or loss is absorbed in the year 
it arises or is carried forward and absorbed in a subsequent year (e.g., 
under section 172, 465, or 1212), the deduction or loss is taken into 
account under paragraph (b)(2) of this section in the year in which it 
is absorbed.
    (B) To the extent that S's deduction or loss is carried back and 
absorbed in a prior year (whether consolidated or separate), the 
deduction or loss is taken into account under paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section in the year in which it arises and not in the year in which it 
is absorbed.
    (ii) Tax-exempt income--(A) In general. S's tax-exempt income is its 
income and gain which is taken into account but permanently excluded 
from its gross income under applicable law, and which increases, 
directly or indirectly, the basis of its assets (or an equivalent 
amount). For example, S's dividend income to which Sec. 1.1502-
13(f)(2)(ii) applies, and its interest excluded from gross income under 
section 103, are treated as tax-exempt income. However, S's income not 
recognized under section 1031 is not treated as tax- exempt income 
because the corresponding basis adjustments under section 1031(d) 
prevent S's nonrecognition from being permanent. Similarly, S's tax-
exempt income does not include gain not recognized under section 332 
from the liquidation of a lower-tier subsidiary, or not recognized under 
section 118 or section 351 from a transfer of assets to S.
    (B) Equivalent deductions. To the extent that S's taxable income or 
gain is permanently offset by a deduction or loss that does not reduce, 
directly or indirectly, the basis of S's assets (or an equivalent 
amount), the income or gain is treated as tax-exempt income and is taken 
into account under paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section. In addition, 
the income and the offsetting item are taken into account under 
paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section. For example, if S receives a $100 
dividend with respect to which a $70 dividends received deduction is 
allowed under section 243, $70 of the dividend is treated as tax-exempt 
income. Accordingly, P's basis in S's stock increases by $100 because 
the $100 dividend and $70 deduction are taken into account under 
paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section (resulting in $30 of the increase), 
and $70 of the dividend is also taken into account under paragraph 
(b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section as tax-exempt income (resulting in $70 of 
the increase). (See paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section if there is a 
corresponding negative adjustment under section 1059.) Similarly, income 
from mineral properties is treated as tax-exempt income to the extent it 
is offset by deductions for depletion in excess of the basis of the 
property.
    (C) Discharge of indebtedness income--(1) [Reserved]. For further 
guidance, see Sec. 1.1502-32T(b)(3)(ii)(C)(1).
    (2) Expired loss carryovers. If the amount of the discharge exceeds 
the amount of the attribute reduction, the excess is nevertheless 
treated as applied to reduce tax attributes to the extent a loss 
carryover expired without tax benefit, the expiration was taken into 
account as a noncapital, nondeductible expense under paragraph 
(b)(3)(iii) of this section, and the loss carryover would have been 
reduced had it not expired.
    (D) Basis shifts. An increase in the basis of S's assets (or an 
equivalent as described in paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(B) of this section) is 
treated as tax-exempt income to the extent that the increase is not 
otherwise taken into account in determining stock basis, it corresponds 
to a negative adjustment that is taken into account by the group under 
this paragraph (b) (or incurred by the common parent), and it has the 
effect (viewing the group in the aggregate) of a permanent recovery of 
the reduction. For example, S's basis increase under section 50(c)(2) is 
treated as tax-exempt income to the extent the preceding basis reduction 
under section 50(c)(1) is reflected in the basis of a member's stock. On 
the other hand, if S increases the basis of an asset as the result of an 
accounting method change, and the related positive section 481(a) 
adjustment is taken into account over time, the basis increase is not 
treated as tax-exempt income.

[[Page 382]]

    (iii) Noncapital, nondeductible expenses--(A) [Reserved]. For 
further guidance, see Sec. 1.1502-32T(b)(3)(iii)(A).
    (B) Nondeductible basis recovery. Any other decrease in the basis of 
S's assets (or an equivalent as described in paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(B) of 
this section) may be a noncapital, nondeductible expense to the extent 
that the decrease is not otherwise taken into account in determining 
stock basis and is permanently eliminated for purposes of determining 
S's taxable income or loss. Whether a decrease is so treated is 
determined by taking into account both the purposes of the Code or 
regulatory provision resulting in the decrease and the purposes of this 
section. For example, S's noncapital, nondeductible expenses include any 
basis reduction under section 50(c)(1), section 1017, section 1059, 
Sec. 1.1502-35T(b) or (f)(2). Also included as a noncapital, 
nondeductible expense is the amount of any gross-up for taxes paid by 
another taxpayer that S is treated as having paid (e.g., income included 
under section 78, or the portion of an undistributed capital gain 
dividend that is treated as tax deemed to have been paid by a 
shareholder under section 852(b)(3)(D)(ii), whether or not any 
corresponding amount is claimed as a tax credit). In contrast, a 
decrease generally is not a noncapital, nondeductible expense if it 
results because S redeems stock in a transaction to which section 302(a) 
applies, S receives assets in a liquidation to which section 332 applies 
and its basis in the assets is less than its basis in the stock 
canceled, or S distributes the stock of a subsidiary in a distribution 
to which section 355 applies.
    (C) and (D) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1502-
32T(b)(3)(iii)(C) and (D).
    (iv) Special rules for tax-exempt income and noncapital, 
nondeductible expenses. For purposes of paragraphs (b)(3)(ii) and (iii) 
of this section:
    (A) Treatment as permanent. An amount is permanently excluded from 
gross income, or permanently disallowed or eliminated, if it is so 
treated by S even though another person may take a corresponding amount 
into account. For example, if S sells property to a nonmember at a loss 
that is disallowed under section 267(a), S's loss is a noncapital, 
nondeductible expense even though under section 267(d) the nonmember may 
treat a corresponding amount of gain as not recognized. (If the 
nonmember is a subsidiary in another consolidated group, its gain not 
recognized under section 267(d) is tax-exempt income under paragraph 
(b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section.)
    (B) Amounts equivalent to basis and adjustments to basis. Amounts 
equivalent to basis include the amount of money, the amount of a loss 
carryover, and the amount of an adjustment to gain or loss under section 
475(a) for securities described in section 475(a)(2). An equivalent to a 
basis increase includes a decrease in an excess loss account, and an 
equivalent to a basis decrease includes the denial of basis for taxable 
income.
    (C) Timing. An amount is taken into account in the year in which it 
would be taken into account under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section if 
it were subject to Federal income taxation.
    (D) Tax sharing agreements. Taxes are taken into account by applying 
the principles of section 1552 and the percentage method under Sec. 
1.1502-33(d)(3) (and by assuming a 100% allocation of any decreased tax 
liability). The treatment of amounts allocated under this paragraph 
(b)(3)(iv)(D) is analogous to the treatment of allocations under Sec. 
1.1552-1(b)(2). For example, if one member owes a payment to a second 
member, the first member is treated as indebted to the second member. 
The right to receive payment is treated as a positive adjustment under 
paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, and the obligation to make payment 
is treated as a negative adjustment under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this 
section. If the obligation is not paid, the amount not paid generally is 
treated as a distribution, contribution, or both, depending on the 
relationship between the members.
    (v) Distributions. Distributions taken into account under paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section are distributions with respect to S's stock to 
which section 301 applies and all other distributions treated as 
dividends (e.g., under section 356(a)(2)). See Sec. 1.1502-13(f)(2)(iv) 
for taking into account distributions to which section 301 applies (but 
not other distributions treated as dividends) under the entitlement 
rule.

    (4) Waiver of loss carryovers from separate return limitation 
years--(i) General rule. If S has a loss carryover from a separate 
return limitation year when it becomes a member of a consolidated group, 
the group may make an irrevocable election to treat all or any portion 
of the loss carryover as expiring for all Federal income tax purposes 
immediately before S becomes a member of the consolidated group (deemed 
expiration). If S was a member of another group immediately before it 
became a member of the consolidated group, the expiration is also 
treated as occurring immediately after it ceases to be a member of the 
prior group.
    (ii) Stock basis adjustments from a waiver--(A) Qualifying 
transactions. If S becomes a member of the consolidated group in a 
qualifying cost basis transaction and an election under this paragraph 
(b)(4) is made, the noncapital, nondeductible expense resulting from the 
deemed expiration does not result in a corresponding stock basis 
adjustment for any member under this section. A qualifying cost basis 
transaction is the purchase (i.e., a transaction in which basis is 
determined under section 1012) by members of the acquiring consolidated 
group (while they are members) in a 12-month period of an amount of S's 
stock satisfying the requirements of section 1504(a)(2).
    (B) Nonqualifying transactions. If S becomes a member of the 
consolidated group other than in a qualifying cost basis transaction and 
an election under this paragraph (b)(4) is made, the basis of its stock 
that is owned by members immediately after it becomes a member is 
subject to reduction under the principles of this section to reflect the 
deemed expiration. The reduction occurs immediately before S becomes a 
member, but after it ceases to be a member of any prior group, and it 
therefore does not result in a corresponding stock basis adjustment for 
any higher-tier member of the transferring or acquiring consolidated 
group. Any basis reduction under this paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(B) is taken 
into account in making determinations of basis under the Code with 
respect to S's stock (e.g., a determination under section 362 because 
the stock is acquired in a transaction described in section 
368(a)(1)(B)), but it does not result in corresponding stock basis 
adjustments under this section for any higher-tier member. If the basis 
reduction exceeds the basis of S's stock, the excess is treated as an 
excess loss account to which the members owning S's stock succeed.
    (C) Higher-tier corporations. If S becomes a member of the 
consolidated group as a result, in whole or in part, of a higher-tier 
corporation becoming a member (whether or not in a qualifying cost basis 
transaction), additional adjustments are required. The highest-tier 
corporation (T) whose becoming a member resulted in S becoming a member, 
and T's chain of lower-tier corporations that includes S, are subject to 
the adjustment. The deemed expiration of S's loss carryover that results 
in a negative adjustment for the first higher-tier corporation is 
treated as an expiring loss carryover of that higher-tier corporation 
for purposes of applying paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(B) of this section to that 
corporation. For example, if P purchases all of the stock of T, T owns 
all of the stock of T1, T1 owns all of the stock of S, S becomes a 
member as a result of T becoming a member, and the election under this 
paragraph (b)(4) is made, the basis of the S stock is reduced and the 
reduction tiers up to T1, T1 treats the negative adjustment to its basis 
in S's stock as an expiring loss carryover of T1, and T then adjusts its 
basis in T1's stock. In addition, if T becomes a member of the acquiring 
group in a transaction other than a qualifying cost basis transaction, 
the amount that tiers up to T also reduces the basis of its stock under 
paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(B) of this section (but the amount does not tier up 
to higher-tier members).
    (iii) Net asset basis limitation. Basis reduced under this paragraph 
(b)(4) is restored before S becomes a member (and before the basis of 
S's stock is taken into account in determining basis under the Code) to 
the extent necessary to conform a share's basis to its allocable portion 
of net asset basis. In the case of higher-tier corporations under 
paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(C) of this section, the restoration does not tier 
up but is instead applied separately to

[[Page 384]]

each higher-tier corporation. For purposes of determining each 
corporation's net asset basis (including the basis of stock in lower-
tier corporations), the restoration is applied in the order of tiers, 
from the lowest to the highest. For purposes of the restoration:
    (A) A member's net asset basis is the positive or negative 
difference between the adjusted basis of its assets (and the amount of 
any of its loss carryovers that are not deemed to expire) and its 
liabilities. Appropriate adjustments must be made, for example, to 
disregard liabilities that subsequently will give rise to deductions 
(e.g., liabilities to which section 461(h) applies).
    (B) Within a class of stock, each share has the same allocable 
portion of net asset basis. If there is more than one class of common 
stock, the net asset basis is allocated to each class by taking into 
account the terms of each class and all other facts and circumstances 
relating to the overall economic arrangement.
    (iv) Election. The election described in this paragraph (b)(4) must 
be made in a separate statement entitled ``ELECTION TO TREAT LOSS 
CARRYOVER AS EXPIRING UNDER Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(4).'' The statement must 
be filed with the consolidated group's return for the year S becomes a 
member, and it must be signed by the common parent and S. A separate 
statement must be made for each member whose loss carryover is deemed to 
expire. The statement must identify the amount of each loss carryover 
deemed to expire (or the amount of each loss carryover deemed not to 
expire, with any balance of any loss carryovers being deemed to expire), 
the basis of any stock reduced as a result of the deemed expiration, and 
the computation of the basis reduction.

    (vi) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1502-
32T(b)(4)(vi).
    (vii) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1502-
32T(b)(4)(vii).
    (5) Examples--(i) In general. For purposes of the examples in this 
section, unless otherwise stated, P owns all of the only class of S's 
stock, the stock is owned for the entire year, S owns no stock of lower-
tier members, the tax year of all persons is the calendar year, all 
persons use the accrual method of accounting, the facts set forth the 
only corporate activity, preferred stock is described in section 
1504(a)(4), all transactions are between unrelated persons, and tax 
liabilities are disregarded.
    (ii) Stock basis adjustments. The principles of this paragraph (b) 
are illustrated by the following examples.

    Example 1. Taxable income. (a) Current taxable income. For Year 1, 
the P group has $100 of taxable income when determined by including only 
S's items of income, gain, deduction, and loss taken into account. Under 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, P's basis in S's stock is adjusted 
under this section as of the close of Year 1. Under paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section, P's basis in S's stock is increased by the amount of the P 
group's taxable income determined by including only S's items taken into 
account. Thus, P's basis in S's stock is increased by $100 as of the 
close of Year 1.
    (b) Intercompany gain that is not taken into account. The facts are 
the same as in paragraph (a) of this Example 1, except that S also sells 
property to another member at a $25 gain in Year 1, the gain is deferred 
under Sec. 1.1502-13 and taken into account in Year 3, and P sells 10% 
of S's stock to nonmembers in Year 2. Under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this 
section, S's deferred gain is not additional taxable income for Year 1 
or 2 because it is not taken into account in determining the P group's 
consolidated taxable income for either of those years. The deferred gain 
is not tax-exempt income under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section 
because it is not permanently excluded from S's gross income. The 
deferred gain does not result in a basis adjustment until Year 3, when 
it is taken into account in determining the P group's consolidated 
taxable income. Consequently, P's basis in the S shares sold is not 
increased to reflect S's gain from the intercompany sale of the 
property. In Year 3, the deferred gain is taken into account, but the 
amount allocable to the shares sold by P does not increase their basis 
because these shares are held by nonmembers.
    (c) Intercompany gain taken into account. The facts are the same as 
in paragraph (b) of this Example 1, except that P sells all of S's stock 
in Year 2 (rather than only 10%). Under Sec. 1.1502-13, S takes the $25 
gain into account immediately before S becomes a nonmember. Thus, P's 
basis in S's stock is increased to reflect S's gain from the 
intercompany sale of the property.
    Example 2. Tax loss. (a) Current absorption. For Year 2, the P group 
has a $50 consolidated net operating loss when determined by

[[Page 385]]

taking into account only S's items of income, gain, deduction, and loss. 
S's loss is absorbed by the P group in Year 2, offsetting P's income for 
that year. Under paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section, because S's 
loss is absorbed in the year it arises, P has a $50 negative adjustment 
with respect to S's stock. Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, P 
reduces its basis in S's stock by $50. Under paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of 
this section, if the decrease exceeds P's basis in S's stock, the excess 
is P's excess loss account in S's stock.
    (b) Interim determination from stock sale. The facts are the same as 
in paragraph (a) of this Example 2, except that S's Year 2 loss arises 
in the first half of the calendar year, P sells 50% of S's stock on July 
1 of Year 2, and P's income for Year 2 does not arise until after the 
sale of S's stock. P's income for Year 2 (exclusive of the sale of S's 
stock) is offset by S's loss, even though the income arises after the 
stock sale, and no loss remains to be apportioned to S. See Sec. Sec. 
1.1502-11 and 1.1502-21(b). Under paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this 
section, because S's $50 loss is absorbed in the year it arises, it 
reduces P's basis in the S shares sold by $25 immediately before the 
stock sale. Because S becomes a nonmember, the loss also reduces P's 
basis in the retained S shares by $25 immediately before S becomes a 
nonmember.
    (c) Loss carryback. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of 
this Example 2, except that P has no income or loss for Year 2, S's $50 
loss is carried back and absorbed by the P group in Year 1 (offsetting 
the income of P or S), and the P group receives a $17 tax refund in Year 
2 that is paid to S. Under paragraph (b)(3)(i)(B) of this section, 
because the $50 loss is carried back and absorbed in Year 1, it is 
treated as a tax loss for Year 2 (the year in which it arises). Under 
paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, the refund is treated as tax-
exempt income of S. Under paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(C) of this section, the 
tax- exempt income is taken into account in Year 2 because that is the 
year it would be taken into account under S's method of accounting if it 
were subject to Federal income taxation. Thus, under paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section, P reduces its basis in S's stock by $33 as of the close of 
Year 2 (the $50 tax loss, less the $17 tax refund).
    (d) Loss carryforward. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of 
this Example 2, except that P has no income or loss for Year 2, and S's 
loss is carried forward and absorbed by the P group in Year 3 
(offsetting the income of P or S). Under paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this 
section, the loss is not treated as a tax loss under paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section until Year 3.
    Example 3. Tax-exempt income and noncapital, nondeductible expenses. 
(a) Facts. For Year 1, the P group has $500 of consolidated taxable 
income. However, the P group has a $100 consolidated net operating loss 
when determined by including only S's items of income, gain, deduction, 
and loss taken into account. Also for Year 1, S has $80 of interest 
income that is permanently excluded from gross income under section 103, 
and S incurs $60 of related expense for which a deduction is permanently 
disallowed under section 265.
    (b) Analysis. Under paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section, S has a 
$100 tax loss for Year 1. Under paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, 
S has $80 of tax-exempt income. Under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this 
section, S has $60 of noncapital, nondeductible expense. Under paragraph 
(b)(3)(iv)(C) of this section, the tax-exempt income and noncapital, 
nondeductible expense are taken into account in Year 1 because that is 
the year they would be taken into account under S's method of accounting 
if they were subject to Federal income taxation. Thus, under paragraph 
(b) of this section, P reduces its basis in S's stock as of the close of 
Year 1 by an $80 net amount (the $100 tax loss, less $80 of tax-exempt 
income, plus $60 of noncapital, nondeductible expenses).
    Example 4. Discharge of indebtedness.  (a), (b), and (c) [Reserved]. 
For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1502-32T(b)(5)(ii), Example 4(a), (b), 
and (c).
    (d) Purchase price adjustment. Assume instead that S buys land in 
Year 1 in exchange for S's $100 purchase money note (bearing interest at 
a market rate of interest in excess of the applicable Federal rate, and 
providing for a principal payment at the end of Year 10), and the seller 
agrees with S in Year 4 to discharge $60 of the note as a purchase price 
adjustment to which section 108(e)(5) applies. S has no discharge of 
indebtedness income that is treated as tax-exempt income under paragraph 
(b)(3)(ii) of this section. In addition, the $60 purchase price 
adjustment is not a noncapital, nondeductible expense under paragraph 
(b)(3)(iii) of this section. A purchase price adjustment is not 
equivalent to a discharge of indebtedness that is offset by a deduction 
or loss. Consequently, the purchase price adjustment results in no net 
adjustment to P's basis in S's stock under paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    Example 5. Distributions. (a) Amounts declared and distributed. For 
Year 1, the P group has $120 of consolidated taxable income when 
determined by including only S's items of income, gain, deduction, and 
loss taken into account. S declares and makes a $10 dividend 
distribution to P at the close of Year 1. Under paragraph (b) of this 
section, P increases its basis in S's stock as of the close of Year 1 by 
a $110 net amount ($120 of taxable income, less a $10 distribution).
    (b) Distributions in later years. The facts are the same as in 
paragraph (a) of this Example 5, except that S does not declare and 
distribute the $10 until Year 2. Under paragraph (b) of this section, P 
increases its basis in S's stock by $120 as of the close of Year 1, and

[[Page 386]]

decreases its basis by $10 as of the close of Year 2. (If P were also a 
subsidiary, the basis of its stock would also be increased in Year 1 to 
reflect P's $120 adjustment to basis of S's stock; the basis of P's 
stock would not be changed as a result of S's distribution in Year 2, 
because P's $10 of tax-exempt dividend income under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) 
of this section would be offset by the $10 negative adjustment to P's 
basis in S's stock for the distribution.)
    (c) Amounts declared but not distributed. The facts are the same as 
in paragraph (a) of this Example 5, except that, during December of Year 
1, S declares (and P becomes entitled to) another $70 dividend 
distribution with respect to its stock, but P does not receive the 
distribution until after it sells all of S's stock at the close of Year 
1. Under Sec. 1.1502-13(f)(2)(iv), S is treated as making a $70 
distribution to P at the time P becomes entitled to the distribution. 
(If S is distributing an appreciated asset, its gain under section 311 
is also taken into account under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section at 
the time P becomes entitled to the distribution.) Consequently, under 
paragraph (b) of this section, P increases its basis in S's stock as of 
the close of Year 1 by only a $40 net amount ($120 of taxable income, 
less two distributions totalling $80). Any further adjustments after S 
ceases to be a member and the $70 distribution is made would be 
duplicative, because the stock basis has already been adjusted for the 
distribution. Accordingly, the distribution will not result in further 
adjustments or gain, even if the distribution is a payment to which 
section 301(c)(2) or (3) applies.
    Example 6. Reorganization with boot. (a) Facts. P owns all of the 
stock of S and T. On January 1 of Year 1, P has a $100 basis in the S 
stock and a $60 basis in the T stock. S and T have no items of income, 
gain, deduction, or loss for Year 1. S and T each have substantial 
earnings and profits. At the close of Year 1, T merges into S in a 
reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(A) (and in section 
368(a)(1)(D)). P receives no additional S stock, but does receive $10 
which is treated as a dividend under section 356(a)(2).
    (b) Analysis. Under section 358, P's basis in the S stock is 
increased by its basis in the T stock. Under Sec. 1.1502-13(f)(3) the 
money received is treated as being taken into account immediately after 
the transaction. Thus, the $10 is treated as a dividend distribution 
under section 301 and under paragraph (b)(3)(v) of this section, the $10 
is a distribution to which paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section applies. 
Accordingly, P's basis in the S stock is $160 immediately after the 
merger, which is then decreased by the $10 distribution taken into 
account immediately after the transaction, resulting in a basis of $150.
    Example 7. Tiering up of basis adjustments. P owns all of S's stock, 
and S owns all of T's stock. For Year 1, the P group has $100 of 
consolidated taxable income when determined by including only T's items 
of income, gain, deduction, and loss taken into account, and $50 of 
consolidated taxable income when determined by including only S's items 
taken into account. S increases its basis in T's stock by $100 under 
paragraph (b) of this section. Under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, 
this $100 basis adjustment is taken into account in determining P's 
adjustments to its basis in S's stock. Thus, P increases its basis in 
S's stock by $150 under paragraph (b) of this section.
    Example 8. Allocation of items. (a) Acquisition in mid-year. P is 
the common parent of a consolidated group, and S is an unaffiliated 
corporation filing separate returns on a calendar-year basis. P acquires 
all of S's stock and S becomes a member of the P group on July 1 of Year 
1. For the entire calendar Year 1, S has $100 of ordinary income and 
under Sec. 1.1502-76(b) $60 is allocated to the period from January 1 
to June 30 and $40 to the period from July 1 to December 31. Under 
paragraph (b) of this section, P increases its basis in S's stock by 
$40.
    (b) Sale in mid-year. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of 
this Example 8, except that S is a member of the P group at the 
beginning of Year 1 but ceases to be a member on June 30 as a result of 
P's sale of S's stock. Under paragraph (b) of this section, P increases 
its basis in S's stock by $60 immediately before the stock sale. (P's 
basis increase would be the same if S became a nonmember because S 
issued additional shares to nonmembers.)
    (c) Absorption of loss carryovers. Assume instead that S is a member 
of the P group at the beginning of Year 1 but ceases to be a member on 
June 30 as a result of P's sale of S's stock, and a $100 consolidated 
net operating loss attributable to S is carried over by the P group to 
Year 1. The consolidated net operating loss may be apportioned to S for 
its first separate return year only to the extent not absorbed by the P 
group during Year 1. Under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, if the 
loss is absorbed by the P group in Year 1, whether the offsetting income 
arises before or after P's sale of S's stock, the absorption of the loss 
carryover is included in the determination of S's taxable income or loss 
for Year 1. Thus, P's basis in S's stock is adjusted under paragraph (b) 
of this section to reflect any absorption of the loss by the P group.
    Example 9. Gross-ups. (a) Facts. P owns all of the stock of S, and S 
owns all of the stock of T, a newly formed controlled foreign 
corporation that is not a passive foreign investment company. In Year 1, 
T has $100 of subpart F income and pays $34 of foreign income tax, 
leaving T with $66 of earnings and profits. The P group has $100 of 
consolidated taxable income when determined by taking into

[[Page 387]]

account only S's items (the inclusion under section 951(a), taking into 
account the section 78 gross-up). As a result of the section 951(a) 
inclusion, S increases its basis in T's stock by $66 under section 
961(a).
    (b) Analysis. Under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, S has $100 
of taxable income. Under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B) of this section, the 
$34 gross-up for taxes paid by T that S is treated as having paid is a 
noncapital, nondeductible expense (whether or not any corresponding 
amount is claimed by the P group as a tax credit). Thus, P increases its 
basis in S's stock under paragraph (b) of this section by the net 
adjustment of $66.
    (c) Subsequent distribution. The facts are the same as in paragraph 
(a) of this Example 9, except that T distributes its $66 of earnings and 
profits in Year 2. The $66 distribution received by S is excluded from 
S's income under section 959(a) because the distribution represents 
earnings and profits attributable to amounts that were included in S's 
income under section 951(a) for Year 1. In addition, S's basis in T's 
stock is decreased by $66 under section 961(b). The excluded 
distribution is not tax-exempt income under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this 
section because of the corresponding reduction to S's basis in T's 
stock. Consequently, P's basis in S's stock is not adjusted under 
paragraph (b) of this section for Year 2.
    Example 10. Recapture of tax-exempt items. (a) Facts. S is a life 
insurance company. For Year 1, the P group has $200 of consolidated 
taxable income, determined by including only S's items of income, gain, 
deduction, and loss taken into account (including a $300 small company 
deduction under section 806). In addition, S has $100 of tax-exempt 
interest income, $60 of which is S's company share. The remaining $40 of 
tax-exempt income is the policyholders' share that reduces S's deduction 
for increase in reserves.
    (b) Tax-exempt items generally. Under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this 
section, S has $200 of taxable income for Year 1. Also for Year 1, S has 
$100 of tax-exempt income under paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, 
and another $300 is treated as tax-exempt income under paragraph 
(b)(3)(ii)(B) of this section because of the deduction under section 
806. Under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, S has $40 of 
noncapital, nondeductible expenses for Year 1 because S's deduction 
under section 807 for its increase in reserves has been permanently 
reduced by the $40 policyholders' share of the tax-exempt interest 
income. Thus, P increases its basis in S's stock by $560 under paragraph 
(b) of this section.
    (c) Recapture. Assume instead that S is a property and casualty 
company and, for Year 1, S accrues $100 of estimated salvage recoverable 
under section 832. Of this amount, $87 (87% of $100) is excluded from 
gross income because of the ``fresh start'' provisions of Sec. 11305(c) 
of P.L. 101-508 (the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990). Thus, S 
has $87 of tax-exempt income under paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this 
section that increases P's basis in S's stock for Year 1. (S also has 
$13 of taxable income over the period of inclusion under section 481.) 
In Year 5, S determines that the $100 salvage recoverable was 
overestimated by $30 and deducts $30 for the reduction of the salvage 
recoverable. However, S has $26.10 (87% of $30) of taxable income in 
Year 5 due to the partial recapture of its fresh start. Because S has no 
basis corresponding to this income, S is treated under paragraph 
(b)(3)(iii)(B) of this section as having a $26.10 noncapital, 
nondeductible expense in Year 5. This treatment is necessary to reflect 
the elimination of the erroneous fresh start in S's stock basis and 
causes a decrease in P's basis in S's stock by $30 for Year 5 (a $3.90 
taxable loss and a $26.10 special adjustment).

    (c) Allocation of adjustments among shares of stock--(1) In general. 
The portion of the adjustment under paragraph (b) of this section that 
is described in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section (negative 
adjustments for distributions) is allocated to the shares of S's stock 
to which the distribution relates. The remainder of the adjustment, 
described in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section 
(adjustments for taxable income or loss, tax-exempt income, and 
noncapital, nondeductible expenses), is allocated among the shares of 
S's stock as provided in paragraphs (c)(2) through (4) of this section. 
If the remainder of the adjustment is positive, it is allocated first to 
any preferred stock to the extent provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this 
section, and then to the common stock as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of 
this section. If the remainder of the adjustment is negative, it is 
allocated only to common stock as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section. An adjustment under this section allocated to a share for the 
period the share is owned by a nonmember has no effect on the basis of 
the share. See paragraph (c)(4) of this section for the reallocation of 
adjustments, and paragraph (d) of this section for definitions. See 
Sec. 1.1502-19(d) for special allocations of basis determined or 
adjusted under the Code with respect to excess loss accounts.
    (2) Common stock--(i) Allocation within a class. The portion of the 
adjustment described in paragraphs (b)(2)(i)

[[Page 388]]

through (iii) of this section (the adjustment determined without taking 
distributions into account) that is allocable to a class of common stock 
is generally allocated equally to each share within the class. However, 
if a member has an excess loss account in shares of a class of common 
stock at the time of a positive adjustment, the portion of the 
adjustment allocable to the member with respect to the class is 
allocated first to equalize and eliminate that member's excess loss 
accounts and then to increase equally its basis in the shares of that 
class. Similarly, any negative adjustment is allocated first to reduce 
the member's positive basis in shares of the class before creating or 
increasing its excess loss account. Distributions and any adjustments or 
determinations under the Internal Revenue Code (e.g., under section 358, 
including any modifications under Sec. 1.1502-19(d)) are taken into 
account before the allocation is made under this paragraph (c)(2)(i).
    (ii) Allocation among classes--(A) General rule. If S has more than 
one class of common stock, the extent to which the adjustment described 
in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section (the adjustment 
determined without taking distributions into account) is allocated to 
each class is determined, based on consistently applied assumptions, by 
taking into account the terms of each class and all other facts and 
circumstances relating to the overall economic arrangement. The 
allocation generally must reflect the manner in which the classes 
participate in the economic benefit or burden (if any) corresponding to 
the items of income, gain, deduction, or loss allocated. In determining 
participation, any differences in voting rights are not taken into 
account, and the following factors are among those to be considered--
    (1) The interest of each share in economic profits and losses (if 
different from the interest in taxable income);
    (2) The interest of each share in cash flow and other non-
liquidating distributions; and
    (3) The interest of each share in distributions in liquidation.
    (B) Distributions and Code adjustments. Distributions and any 
adjustments or determinations under the Internal Revenue Code are taken 
into account before the allocation is made under this paragraph 
(c)(2)(ii).
    (3) Preferred stock. If the adjustment under paragraphs (b)(2)(i) 
through (iii) of this section (the adjustment determined without taking 
distributions into account) is positive, it is allocated to preferred 
stock to the extent required (when aggregated with prior allocations to 
the preferred stock during the period that S is a member of the 
consolidated group) to reflect distributions described in section 301 
(and all other distributions treated as dividends) to which the 
preferred stock becomes entitled, and arrearages arising, during the 
period that S is a member of the consolidated group. For this purpose, 
the preferred stock is treated as entitled to a distribution no later 
than the time the distribution is taken into account under the Internal 
Revenue Code (e.g., under section 305). If the amount of distributions 
and arrearages exceeds the positive amount (when aggregated with prior 
allocations), the positive amount is first allocated among classes of 
preferred stock to reflect their relative priorities, and the amount 
allocated to each class is then allocated pro rata within the class. An 
allocation to a share with respect to arrearages and distributions for 
the period the share is owned by a nonmember is not reflected in the 
basis of the share under paragraph (b) of this section. However, if P 
and S cease to be members of one consolidated group and remain 
affiliated as members of another consolidated group, P's ownership of 
S's stock during consolidated return years of the prior group is treated 
for this purpose as ownership by a member to the extent that the 
adjustments during the prior consolidated return years are still 
reflected in the basis of the preferred stock.
    (4) Cumulative redetermination--(i) General rule. A member's basis 
in each share of S's preferred and common stock must be redetermined 
whenever necessary to determine the tax liability of any person. See 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The redetermination is made by 
reallocating S's net adjustment described in paragraphs (b)(2)(i)

[[Page 389]]

through (iii) of this section (the adjustment determined without taking 
distributions into account) for each consolidated return year (or other 
applicable period) of the group by taking into account all of the facts 
and circumstances affecting allocations under this paragraph (c) as of 
the redetermination date with respect to all of S's shares. For this 
purpose:
    (A) Amounts may be reallocated from one class of S's stock to 
another class, but not from one share of a class to another share of the 
same class.
    (B) If there is a change in the equity structure of S (e.g., as the 
result of S's issuance, redemption, or recapitalization of shares), a 
cumulative redetermination is made for the period before the change. If 
a reallocation is required by another redetermination after a change, 
amounts arising after the change are reallocated before amounts arising 
before the change.
    (C) If S becomes a nonmember as a result of a change in its equity 
structure, any reallocation is made only among the shares of S's stock 
immediately before the change. For example, if S issues stock to a 
nonmember creditor in exchange for its debt, and the exchange results in 
S becoming a nonmember, any reallocation is only among the shares of S's 
stock immediately before the exchange.
    (D) Any reallocation is treated for all purposes after it is made 
(including subsequent redeterminations) as the original allocation of an 
amount under this paragraph (c), but the reallocation does not affect 
any prior period.
    (ii) Prior use of allocations. An amount may not be reallocated 
under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section to the extent that the amount 
has been used before the reallocation. For this purpose, an amount has 
been used to the extent it has been taken into account, directly or 
indirectly, by any member in determining income, gain, deduction, or 
loss, or in determining the basis of any property that is not subject to 
this section (e.g., stock of a corporation that has become a nonmember). 
For example, if P sells a share of S stock, an amount previously 
allocated to the share cannot be reallocated to another share of S 
stock, but an amount allocated to another share of S stock can still be 
reallocated to the sold share because the reallocated amount has not 
been taken into account; however, any adjustment reallocated to the sold 
share may effectively be eliminated, because the reallocation was not in 
effect when the share was previously sold and P's gain or loss from the 
sale is not redetermined. If, however, P sells the share of S stock to 
another member, the amount is not used until P's gain or loss is taken 
into account under Sec. 1.1502-13.
    (5) Examples. The principles of this paragraph (c) are illustrated 
by the following examples.

    Example 1. Ownership of less than all the stock. (a) Facts. P owns 
80% of S's only class of stock with an $800 basis. For Year 1, S has 
$100 of taxable income.
    (b) Analysis. Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the $100 
positive adjustment under paragraph (b) of this section for S's taxable 
income is allocated among the shares of S's stock, including shares 
owned by nonmembers. Under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, the 
adjustment is allocated equally to each share of S's stock. Thus, P 
increases its basis in S's stock under paragraph (b) of this section as 
of the close of Year 1 by $80. (The basis of the 20% of S's stock owned 
by nonmembers is not adjusted under this section.)
    (c) Varying interest. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of 
this Example 1, except that P buys the remaining 20% of S's stock at the 
close of business on June 30 of Year 1 for $208. Under paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section and the principles of Sec. 1.1502-76(b), S's $100 of 
taxable income is allocable $40 to the period from January 1 to June 30 
and $60 to the period from July 1 to December 31. Thus, for the period 
ending June 30, P is treated as having a $32 adjustment with respect to 
the S stock that P has owned since January 1 (80% of $40) and, under 
paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, the adjustment is allocated equally 
among those shares. For the period ending December 31, P is treated as 
having a $60 adjustment (100% of $60) that is also allocated equally 
among P's shares of S's stock owned after June 30. P's basis in the 
shares owned as of the beginning of the year therefore increases by $80 
(the sum of 80% of $40 and 80% of $60), from $800 to $880, and P's basis 
in the shares purchased on June 30 increases by $12 (20% of $60), from 
$208 to $220. Thus, P's aggregate basis in S's stock as of the end of 
Year 1 is $1,100.
    (d) Tax liability. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of 
this Example 1, except that P pays S's $34 share of the group's 
consolidated tax liability resulting from S's taxable income, and S does 
not reimburse P. S's $100 of taxable income results in a positive

[[Page 390]]

adjustment under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, and S's $34 of tax 
liability results in a negative adjustment under paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(D) 
of this section and the principles of section 1552. Because S does not 
make any payment in recognition of the additional tax liability, by 
analogy to the treatment under Sec. 1.1552-1(b)(2), S is treated as 
having made a $34 payment that is described in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of 
this section (noncapital, nondeductible expenses) and as having received 
an equal amount from P as a capital contribution. Thus, P increases its 
basis in its S stock by $52.80 (80% of the $100 of taxable income, less 
80% of the $34 tax payment). In addition, P increases its basis in S's 
stock by $34 under the Internal Revenue Code and paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section to reflect the capital contribution. In the aggregate, P 
increases its basis in S's stock by $86.80. (If, as in paragraph (c) of 
this Example 1, P buys the remaining 20% of S's stock at the close of 
business on June 30, P increases its basis in S's stock by another $7.90 
for the additional 20% interest in S's income after June 30 ($60 
multiplied by 20%, less 20% of the $20.40 tax payment on $60); the $34 
capital contribution by P is reflected in all of its S shares (not just 
the original 80%), and P's aggregate basis adjustment under this section 
is $94.70 ($86.80 plus $7.90).)
    Example 2. Preferred stock. (a) Facts. P owns all of S's common 
stock with an $800 basis, and nonmembers own all of S's preferred stock. 
The preferred stock was issued for $200, has a $20 annual, cumulative 
preference as to dividends, and has an initial liquidation preference of 
$200. For Year 1, S has $50 of taxable income and no distributions are 
declared or made.
    (b) Analysis of arrearages. Under paragraphs (c) (1) and (3) of this 
section, $20 of the $50 positive adjustment under paragraph (b) of this 
section is allocated first to the preferred stock to reflect the 
dividend arrearage arising in Year 1. The remaining $30 of the positive 
adjustment is allocated to the common stock, increasing P's basis from 
$800 to $830 as of the close of Year 1. (The basis of the preferred 
stock owned by nonmembers is not adjusted under this section.)
    (c) Current distribution. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) 
of this Example 2, except that S declares and makes a $20 distribution 
with respect to the preferred stock during Year 1 in satisfaction of its 
preference. The results are the same as in paragraph (b) of this Example 
2.
    (d) Varying interest. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of 
this Example 2, except that S has no income or loss for Years 1 and 2, P 
purchases all of S's preferred stock at the beginning of Year 3 for 
$240, and S has $70 of taxable income for Year 3. Under paragraph (c)(3) 
of this section, $60 of the $70 positive adjustment under paragraph (b) 
of this section is allocated to the preferred stock to reflect the 
dividends arrearages for Years 1 through 3, but only the $20 for Year 3 
is reflected in the basis of the preferred stock under paragraph (b) of 
this section. (The remaining $40 is not reflected because the preferred 
stock was owned by nonmembers during Years 1 and 2.) Thus, P increases 
its basis in S's preferred stock from $240 to $260, and its basis in S's 
common stock from $800 to $810, as of the close of Year 3. (If P had 
acquired all of S's preferred stock in a transaction to which section 
351 applies, and P's initial basis in S's preferred stock was $200 under 
section 362, P's basis in S's preferred stock would increase from $200 
to $220.)
    (e) Varying interest with current distributions. The facts are the 
same as in paragraph (d) of this Example 2, except that S declares and 
makes a $20 distribution with respect to the preferred stock in each of 
Years 1 and 2 in satisfaction of its preference, and P purchases all of 
S's preferred stock at the beginning of Year 3 for $200. Under paragraph 
(c)(3) of this section, $40 of the $70 positive adjustment under 
paragraph (b) of this section is allocated to the preferred stock to 
reflect the distributions in Years 1 and 2, and $20 of the $70 is 
allocated to the preferred stock to reflect the arrearage for Year 3. 
However, as in paragraph (d) of this Example 2, only the $20 
attributable to Year 3 is reflected in the basis of the preferred stock 
under paragraph (b) of this section. Thus, P increases its basis in S's 
preferred stock from $200 to $220, and P increases its basis in S's 
common stock from $800 to $810.
    Example 3. Cumulative redetermination. (a) Facts. P owns all of S's 
common and preferred stock. The preferred stock has a $100 annual, 
cumulative preference as to dividends. For Year 1, S has $200 of taxable 
income, the first $100 of which is allocated to the preferred stock and 
the remaining $100 of which is allocated to the common stock. For Year 
2, S has no adjustment under paragraph (b) of this section, and P sells 
all of S's common stock at the close of Year 2.
    (b) Analysis. Under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, P's basis in 
S's common stock must be redetermined as of the sale of the stock. The 
redetermination is made by reallocating the $200 positive adjustment 
under paragraph (b) of this section for Year 1 by taking into account 
all of the facts and circumstances affecting allocations as of the sale. 
Thus, the $200 positive adjustment for Year 1 is reallocated entirely to 
the preferred stock to reflect the dividend arrearages for Years 1 and 
2. The reallocation away from the common stock reflects the fact that, 
because of the additional amount of arrearage in Year 2, the common 
stock is not entitled to any part of the $200 of taxable income from 
Year 1. Thus, the common stock has no positive or negative adjustment, 
and the preferred stock

[[Page 391]]

has a $200 positive adjustment. These reallocations are treated as the 
original allocations for Years 1 and 2. (The results for the common 
stock would be the same if the common and preferred stock were not owned 
by the same member, or the preferred stock were owned by nonmembers.)
    (c) Preferred stock issued after adjustment arises. The facts are 
the same as in paragraph (a) of this Example 3, except that S does not 
issue its preferred stock until the beginning of Year 2, S has no 
further adjustment under paragraph (b) of this section for Years 2 and 
3, and P sells S's common stock at the close of Year 3. Under paragraphs 
(c) (1) and (2) of this section, the $200 positive adjustment for Year 1 
is initially allocated entirely to the common stock. Under paragraph 
(c)(4) of this section, the $200 adjustment is reallocated to the 
preferred stock to reflect the arrearages for Years 2 and 3. Thus, the 
common stock has no positive or negative adjustment.
    (d) Common stock issued after adjustment arises. The facts are the 
same as in paragraph (a) of this Example 3, except that S has no 
preferred stock, S issues additional common stock of the same class at 
the beginning of Year 2, S has no further adjustment under paragraph (b) 
of this section in Years 2 and 3, and P sells its S common stock at the 
close of Year 3. Under paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section, the 
$200 positive adjustment for Year 1 is initially allocated entirely to 
the original common stock. Under paragraph (c)(4)(i)(A) of this section, 
the $200 adjustment is not reallocated among the original common stock 
and the additional stock. Unlike the preferred stock in paragraph (c) of 
this Example 3, the additional common stock is of the same class as the 
original stock, and there is no reallocation between shares of the same 
class.
    (e) Positive and negative adjustments. The facts are the same as in 
paragraph (a) of this Example 3, except that S has a $200 loss for Year 
2 that results in a negative adjustment to the common stock before any 
redetermination. For purposes of the basis redetermination under 
paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the Year 1 and 2 adjustments under 
paragraph (b) of this section are not netted. Thus, as in paragraph (b) 
of this Example 3, the redetermination is made by reallocating the $200 
positive adjustment for Year 1 entirely to the preferred stock. The $200 
negative adjustment for Year 2 is allocated entirely to the common 
stock. Consequently, the preferred stock has a $200 positive cumulative 
adjustment, and the common stock has a $200 negative cumulative 
adjustment. (The results would be the same if there were no other 
adjustments described in paragraph (b) of this section, P sells S's 
common stock at the close of Year 3 rather than Year 2, and an 
additional $100 arrearage arises in Year 3; only adjustments under 
paragraph (b) of this section may be reallocated, and there is no 
additional adjustment for Year 3.)
    (f) Current distributions. The facts are the same as in paragraph 
(a) of this Example 3, except that, during Year 1, S declares and makes 
a distribution to P of $100 as a dividend on the preferred stock and 
$100 as a dividend on the common stock. The taxable income and 
distributions result in no Year 1 adjustment under paragraph (b) of this 
section for either the common or preferred stock. For example, if T 
merges into S, S is treated, as the context may require, as a successor 
to T and as becoming a member of the group. However, as in paragraph (b) 
of this Example 3, the redetermination under paragraph (c)(4) of this 
section is made by reallocating a $200 positive adjustment for Year 1 
(S's net adjustment described in paragraph (b) of this section, 
determined without taking distributions into account) to the preferred 
stock. Consequently, the preferred stock has a $100 positive cumulative 
adjustment ($200 of taxable income, less a $100 distribution with 
respect to the preferred stock) and the common stock has a $100 negative 
cumulative adjustment (for the distribution).
    (g) Convertible preferred stock. The facts are the same as in 
paragraph (a) of this Example 3, except that the preferred stock is 
convertible into common stock that is identical to the common stock 
already outstanding, the holders of the preferred stock convert the 
stock at the close of Year 2, and no stock is sold until the close of 
Year 5. Under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the $200 positive 
adjustment for Year 1 is reallocated entirely to the preferred stock 
immediately before the conversion. The newly issued common stock is 
treated as a second class of S common stock, and adjustments under 
paragraph (b) of this section are allocated between the original and the 
new common stock under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. Although 
the preferred stock is converted to common stock, the $200 adjustment to 
the preferred stock is not subsequently reallocated between the original 
and the new common stock. Because the original and the new stock are 
equivalent, adjustments under paragraph (b) of this section for 
subsequent periods are allocated equally to each share.
    (h) Prior use of allocations. The facts are the same as in paragraph 
(a) of this Example 3, except that P sells 10% of S's common stock at 
the close of Year 1, and the remaining 90% at the close of Year 2. P's 
basis in the common stock sold in Year 1 reflects $10 of the adjustment 
allocated to the common stock for Year 1. Under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of 
this section, because $10 of the Year 1 adjustment was used in 
determining P's gain or loss, only $90 is reallocated to the preferred 
stock, and $10 remains allocated to the common stock sold.

[[Page 392]]

    (i) Lower-tier members. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) 
of this Example 3, except that P owns only S's common stock, and P is 
also a subsidiary. If there is a redetermination under paragraph (c)(4) 
of this section by a member owning P's stock, a redetermination with 
respect to S's stock must be made first, and the effect of that 
redetermination on P's adjustments is taken into account under paragraph 
(b) of this section. However, as in paragraph (h) of this Example 3, to 
the extent an amount of the initial adjustments with respect to S's 
common stock have already been tiered up and used by a member owning P's 
stock, that amount remains with S's common stock (and the higher-tier 
member using the adjustment with respect to P's stock), and may not be 
reallocated to S's preferred stock.
    Example 4. Allocation to preferred stock between groups. (a) Facts. 
P owns all of S's only class of stock, and S owns all of T's common and 
preferred stock. The preferred stock has a $100 annual, cumulative 
preference as to dividends. For Year 1, T has $200 of taxable income, 
the first $100 of which is allocated to the preferred stock and the 
remaining $100 of which is allocated to the common stock, and S has no 
adjustments other than the amounts tiered up from T. S and T have no 
adjustments under paragraph (b) of this section for Years 2 and 3. X, 
the common parent of another consolidated group, purchases all of S's 
stock at the close of Year 3, and S and T become members of the X group. 
For Year 4, T has $200 of taxable income, and S has no adjustments other 
than the amounts tiered up from T.
    (b) Analysis for Years 1 through 3. Under paragraph (c)(4) of this 
section, the allocation of S's adjustments under paragraph (b) of this 
section (determined without taking distributions into account) must be 
redetermined as of the time P sells S's stock. As a result of this 
redetermination, T's common stock has no positive or negative adjustment 
and the preferred stock has a $200 positive adjustment.
    (c) Analysis for Year 4. Under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the 
allocation of T's $200 positive adjustment in Year 4 to T's preferred 
stock with respect to arrearages is made by taking into account the 
consolidated return years of both the P group and the X group. Thus, the 
allocation of the $200 positive adjustment for Year 4 to T's preferred 
stock is not treated as an allocation for a period for which the 
preferred stock is owned by a nonmember. Thus, the $200 adjustment is 
reflected in S's basis in T's preferred stock under paragraph (b) of 
this section.

    (d) Definitions. For purposes of this section--
    (1) Class. The shares of a member having the same material terms 
(without taking into account voting rights) are treated as a single 
class of stock.
    (2) Preferred stock. Preferred stock is stock that is limited and 
preferred as to dividends and has a liquidation preference. A class of 
stock that is not described in section 1504(a)(4), however, is not 
treated as preferred stock for purposes of paragraph (c) of this section 
if members own less than 80% of each class of common stock (determined 
without taking this paragraph (d)(2) into account).
    (3) Common stock. Common stock is stock that is not preferred stock.
    (4) Becoming a nonmember. A member is treated as becoming a 
nonmember if it has a separate return year (including another group's 
consolidated return year). For example, S may become a nonmember if it 
issues additional stock to nonmembers, but S does not become a nonmember 
as a result of its complete liquidation.
    (e) Anti-avoidance rule--(1) General rule. If any person acts with a 
principal purpose contrary to the purposes of this section, to avoid the 
effect of the rules of this section or apply the rules of this section 
to avoid the effect of any other provision of the consolidated return 
regulations, adjustments must be made as necessary to carry out the 
purposes of this section.
    (2) Examples. The principles of this paragraph (e) are illustrated 
by the following examples.

    Example 1. Preferred stock treated as common stock. (a) Facts. S has 
100 shares of common stock and 100 shares of preferred stock described 
in section 1504(a)(4). P owns 80 shares of S's common stock and all of 
S's preferred stock. The shareholders expect that S will have negative 
adjustments under paragraph (b) of this section for Years 1 and 2 (all 
of which will be allocable to S's common stock), the negative 
adjustments will have no significant effect on the value of S's stock, 
and S will have offsetting positive adjustments thereafter. When the 
preferred stock was issued, P intended to cause S to recapitalize the 
preferred stock into additional common stock at the end of Year 2 in a 
transaction described in section 368(a)(1)(E). P's temporary ownership 
of the preferred stock is with a principal purpose to limit P's basis 
reductions under paragraph (b) of this section to 80% of the anticipated 
negative adjustments. The recapitalization is intended to cause 
significantly more than 80% of the anticipated positive adjustments

[[Page 393]]

to increase P's basis in S's stock because of P's increased ownership of 
S's common stock immediately after the recapitalization.
    (b) Analysis. S has established a transitory capital structure with 
a principal purpose to enhance P's basis in S's stock under this 
section. Under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, all of S's common and 
preferred stock is treated as a single class of common stock in Years 1 
and 2 for purposes of this section. Thus, S's items are allocated under 
the principles of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, and P decreases 
its basis in both the common and preferred stock accordingly.
    Example 2. Contribution of appreciated property. (a) Facts. P owns 
all of the stock of S and T, and S and T each own 50% of the stock of U. 
P's S stock has a $150 basis and $200 value, and P's T stock has a $200 
basis and $200 value. With a principal purpose to eliminate P's gain 
from an anticipated sale of S's stock, T contributes to U an asset with 
a $100 value and $0 basis, and S contributes $100 cash. U sells T's 
asset and recognizes a $100 gain that results in a $100 positive 
adjustment under paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) Analysis. Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, U's adjustment 
ordinarily would be allocated equally to each share of U's stock. If so 
allocated, P's basis in S's stock would increase from $150 to $200 and P 
would recognize no gain from the sale of S's stock for $200. Under 
paragraph (e)(1) of this section, however, because T transferred an 
appreciated asset to U with a principal purpose to shift a portion of 
the stock basis increase from P's stock in T to P's stock in S, the 
allocation of the $100 positive adjustment under paragraph (c) of this 
section between the shares of U's stock must take into account the 
contribution. Consequently, all $100 of the positive adjustment is 
allocated to the U stock owned by T, rather than $50 to the U stock 
owned by S and $50 to the U stock owned by T. P's basis in S's stock 
remains $150, and its basis in T's stock increases to $300. Thus, P 
recognizes a $50 gain from its sale of S's stock for $200.
    Example 3. Reorganizations. (a) Facts. P forms S with an $800 
contribution, $200 of which is in exchange for S's preferred stock 
described in section 1504(a)(4) and the balance of which is for S's 
common stock. For Years 1 through 3, S has a total of $160 of ordinary 
income, $60 of which is distributed with respect to the preferred stock 
in satisfaction of its $20 annual preference as to dividends. Under this 
section, P's basis in S's preferred stock is unchanged, and its basis in 
S's common stock is increased from $600 to $700. To reduce its gain from 
an anticipated sale of S's preferred stock, P forms T at the close of 
Year 3 with a contribution of all of S's stock in exchange for 
corresponding common and preferred stock of T in a transaction to which 
section 351 applies. At the time of the contribution, the fair market 
value of the common stock is $700 and the fair market value of the 
preferred stock is $300 (due to a decrease in prevailing market interest 
rates). P subsequently sells T's preferred stock for $300.
    (b) Analysis. Under section 358(b), P ordinarily has a $630 basis in 
T's common stock (70% of the $900 aggregate stock basis) and a $270 
basis in T's preferred stock (30% of the $900 aggregate stock basis). 
However, because P transferred S's stock to T with a principal purpose 
to shift the allocation of basis adjustments under this section, 
adjustments are made under paragraph (e)(1) of this section to preserve 
the allocation under this section. Thus, P has a $700 basis in T's 
common stock and a $200 basis in T's preferred stock. Consequently, P 
recognizes a $100 gain from the sale of T's preferred stock.
    Example 4. Post-deconsolidation basis adjustments. (a) Facts. For 
Year 1, the P group has $40 of taxable income when determined by 
including only S's items of income, gain, deduction, and loss taken into 
account, and P increases its basis in S's stock by $40 under paragraph 
(b) of this section. P anticipates that S will have a $40 ordinary loss 
for Year 2 that will be carried back and offset S's income in Year 1 and 
result in a $40 reduction to P's basis in S's stock for Year 2 under 
paragraph (b) of this section. With a principal purpose to avoid the 
reduction, P causes S to issue voting preferred stock that results in S 
becoming a nonmember at the beginning of Year 2. As anticipated, S has a 
$40 loss for Year 2, which is carried back to Year 1 and offsets S's 
income from Year 1.
    (b) Analysis. Under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, because P 
caused S to become a nonmember with a principal purpose to absorb S's 
loss but avoid the corresponding negative adjustment under this section, 
and P bears a substantial portion of the loss because of its continued 
ownership of S common stock, the basis of P's common stock in S is 
decreased by $40 for Year 2. (If P has less than a $40 basis in the 
retained S stock, P must recognize income for Year 2 to the extent of 
the excess.) Section 1504(a)(3) limits the ability of S to subsequently 
rejoin the P group's consolidated return.
    (c) Carryback to pre-consolidation year. The facts are the same as 
in paragraph (a) of this Example 4, except that P anticipates that S's 
loss will be carried back and absorbed in a separate return year of S 
before Year 1 (rather than to the P group's consolidated return for Year 
1). Although P causes S to become a nonmember with a principal purpose 
to avoid the negative adjustment under this section, and P bears a 
substantial portion of the loss because of its continued ownership of S 
common stock, both S's income and loss are taken into account under the 
separate return rules. Consequently, no one has acted with a principal 
purpose contrary to the purposes of this section, and no adjustments are

[[Page 394]]

necessary to carry out the purposes of this section.
    Example 5. Pre-consolidation basis adjustments. (a) Facts. P forms S 
with a $100 contribution, and S becomes a member of the P affiliated 
group which does not file consolidated returns. For Years 1 through 3, S 
earns $300. P anticipates that it will elect under section 1501 for the 
P group to begin filing consolidated returns in Year 5. In anticipation 
of filing consolidated returns, and to avoid the negative stock basis 
adjustment that would result under paragraph (b) of this section from 
distributing S's earnings after Year 5, P causes S to distribute $300 
during Year 4 as a qualifying dividend within the meaning of section 
243(b). There is no plan or intention to recontribute the funds to S 
after the distribution.
    (b) Analysis. Although S's distribution of $300 is with a principal 
purpose to avoid a corresponding negative adjustment under this section, 
the $300 was both earned and distributed entirely under the separate 
return rules. Consequently, P and S have not acted with a principal 
purpose contrary to the purposes of this section, and no adjustments are 
necessary to carry out the purposes of this section.

    (f) Predecessors and successors. For purposes of this section, any 
reference to a corporation or to a share of stock includes a reference 
to a successor or predecessor as the context may require. A corporation 
is a successor if the basis of its assets is determined, directly or 
indirectly, in whole or in part, by reference to the basis of another 
corporation (the predecessor). For example, if T merges into S, S is 
treated, as the context may require, as a successor to T and as becoming 
a member of the group. A share is a successor if its basis is 
determined, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by reference to 
the basis of another share (the predecessor).
    (g) Recordkeeping. Adjustments under this section must be reflected 
annually on permanent records (including work papers). See also section 
6001, requiring records to be maintained. The group must be able to 
identify from these permanent records the amount and allocation of 
adjustments, including the nature of any tax-exempt income and 
noncapital, nondeductible expenses, so as to permit the application of 
the rules of this section for each year.
    (h) Effective date--(1) General rule. This section applies with 
respect to determinations of the basis of the stock of a subsidiary 
(e.g., for determining gain or loss from a disposition of stock) in 
consolidated return years beginning on or after January 1, 1995. If this 
section applies, basis must be determined or redetermined as if this 
section were in effect for all years (including, for example, the 
consolidated return years of another consolidated group to the extent 
adjustments from those years are still reflected). For example, if the 
portion of a consolidated net operating loss carryover attributable to S 
expired in 1990 and is treated as a noncapital, nondeductible expense 
under paragraph (b) of this section, it is taken into account in tax 
years beginning on or after January 1, 1995 as a negative adjustment for 
1990. Any such determination or redetermination does not, however, 
affect any prior period. Thus, the negative adjustment for S's 
noncapital, nondeductible expense is not taken into account for tax 
years beginning before January 1, 1995.
    (2) Dispositions of stock before effective date--(i) In general. If 
P disposes of stock of S in a consolidated return year beginning before 
January 1, 1995, the amount of P's income, gain, deduction, or loss, and 
the basis reflected in that amount, are not redetermined under this 
section. See Sec. 1.1502-19 as contained in the 26 CFR part 1 edition 
revised as of April 1, 1994 for the definition of disposition, and 
paragraph (h)(5) of this section for the rules applicable to such 
dispositions.
    (ii) Lower-tier members. Although P disposes of S's stock in a tax 
year beginning before January 1, 1995, S's determinations or adjustments 
with respect to the stock of a lower-tier member with which it continues 
to file a consolidated return are redetermined in accordance with the 
rules of this section (even if they were previously taken into account 
by P and reflected in income, gain, deduction, or loss from the 
disposition of S's stock). For example, assume that P owns all of S's 
stock, S owns all of T's stock, and T owns all of U's stock. If S sells 
80% of T's stock in a tax year beginning before January 1, 1995 (the 
effective date), the amount of S's income, gain, deduction, or loss from 
the sale, and the stock basis adjustments reflected in that amount, are 
not redetermined if P

[[Page 395]]

sells S's stock after the effective date. If S sells the remaining 20% 
of T's stock after the effective date, S's stock basis adjustments with 
respect to that T stock are also not redetermined because T became a 
nonmember before the effective date. However, if T and U continue to 
file a consolidated return with each other and T sells U's stock after 
the effective date, T's stock basis adjustments with respect to U's 
stock are redetermined (even though some of those adjustments may have 
been taken into account by S in its prior sale of T's stock before the 
effective date).
    (iii) Deferred amounts. For purposes of this paragraph (h)(2), a 
disposition does not include a transaction to which Sec. 1.1502-13, 
Sec. 1.1502-13T, Sec. 1.1502-14, or Sec. 1.1502-14T applies. Instead, 
the transaction is deemed to occur as the income, gain, deduction, or 
loss (if any) is taken into account.
    (3) Distributions--(i) Deemed dividend elections. If there is a 
deemed distribution and recontribution pursuant to Sec. 1.1502-32(f)(2) 
as contained in the 26 CFR part 1 edition revised as of April 1, 1994 in 
a consolidated return year beginning before January 1, 1995, the deemed 
distribution and recontribution under the election are treated as an 
actual distribution by S and recontribution by P as provided under the 
election.
    (ii) Affiliated earnings and profits. This section does not apply to 
reduce the basis in S's stock as a result of a distribution of earnings 
and profits accumulated in separate return years, if the distribution is 
made in a consolidated return year beginning before January 1, 1995, and 
the distribution does not cause a negative adjustment under the 
investment adjustment rules in effect at the time of the distribution. 
See paragraph (h)(5) of this section for the rules in effect with 
respect to the distribution.
    (4) Expiring loss carryovers. If S became a member of a consolidated 
group in a consolidated return year beginning before January 1, 1995, 
and S had a loss carryover from a separate return limitation year at 
that time, the group does not treat any expiration of the loss carryover 
(even if in a tax year beginning on or after January 1, 1995) as a 
noncapital, nondeductible expense resulting in a negative adjustment 
under this section. If S becomes a member of a consolidated group in a 
consolidated return year beginning on or after January 1, 1995, and S 
has a loss carryover from a separate return limitation year at that 
time, adjustments with respect to the expiration are determined under 
this section.
    (5) Prior law--(i) In general. For prior determinations, see prior 
regulations under section 1502 as in effect with respect to the 
determination. See, e.g., Sec. Sec. 1.1502-32 and 1.1502-32T as 
contained in the 26 CFR part 1 edition revised as of April 1, 1994.
    (ii) Continuing basis reductions for certain deconsolidated 
subsidiaries. If a subsidiary ceases to be a member of a group in a 
consolidated return year beginning before January 1, 1995, and its basis 
was subject to reduction under Sec. 1.1502-32T or Sec. 1.1502-32(g) as 
contained in the 26 CFR part 1 edition revised as of April 1, 1994, its 
basis remains subject to reduction under those principles. For example, 
if S ceased to be a member in 1990, and P's basis in any retained S 
stock was subject to a basis reduction account, the basis remains 
subject to reduction. Similarly, if an election could be made to apply 
Sec. 1.1502-32T instead of Sec. 1.1502-32(g), the election remains 
available. However, Sec. Sec. 1.1502-32T and 1.1502-32(g) do not apply 
as a result of a subsidiary ceasing to be a member in tax years 
beginning on or after January 1, 1995.

Sec. 1.1502-32T  Investment adjustments (temporary).

    (a) and (a)(1) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1502-
32(a) and (a)(1).
    (a)(2) Application of other rules of law. The rules of this section 
are in addition to other rules of law. See, e.g., section 358 (basis 
determinations for

[[Page 396]]

distributees), section 1016 (adjustments to basis), Sec. 1.1502-11(b) 
(limitations on the use of losses), Sec. 1.1502-19 (treatment of excess 
loss accounts), Sec. 1.1502-31 (basis after a group structure change), 
and Sec. 1.1502-35T (additional rules relating to stock loss, including 
losses attributable to worthlessness and certain dispositions not 
followed by a separate return year). P's basis in S's stock must not be 
adjusted under this section and other rules of law in a manner that has 
the effect of duplicating an adjustment. For example, if pursuant to 
Sec. 1.1502-35T(c)(3) and paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C) of this section the 
basis in stock is reduced to take into account a loss suspended under 
Sec. 1.1502-35T(c)(1), such basis shall not be further reduced to take 
into account such loss, or a portion of such loss, if any, that is later 
allowed pursuant to Sec. 1.1502-35T(c)(5). See also paragraph (h)(5) of 
this section for basis reductions applicable to certain former 
subsidiaries.
    (b) through (b)(3)(ii)(B) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see 
Sec. 1.1502-32(b) through (b)(3)(ii)(B).
    (C) Discharge of indebtedness income--(1) In general. Discharge of 
indebtedness income of S that is excluded from gross income under 
section 108 is treated as tax-exempt income only to the extent the 
discharge is applied to reduce tax attributes attributable to any member 
of the group under section 108, section 1017, or Sec. 1.1502-28T. If S 
is treated as realizing discharge of indebtedness income that is 
excluded from gross income pursuant to Sec. 1.1502-28T(a)(3), S shall 
not be treated as realizing excluded COD income for purposes of the 
preceding sentence.
    (b)(3)(ii)(C)(2) through (b)(3)(ii)(D) [Reserved]. For further 
guidance, see Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(3)(ii)(C)(2) through (b)(3)(ii)(D).
    (iii) Noncapital, nondeductible expenses--(A) In general. S's 
noncapital, nondeductible expenses are its deductions and losses that 
are taken into account but permanently disallowed or eliminated under 
applicable law in determining its taxable income or loss, and that 
decrease, directly or indirectly, the basis of its assets (or an 
equivalent amount). For example, S's Federal taxes described in section 
275 and loss not recognized under section 311(a) are noncapital, 
nondeductible expenses. Similarly, if a loss carryover (e.g., under 
section 172 or 1212) attributable to S expires or is reduced under 
section 108(b) and Sec. 1.1502-28T, it becomes a noncapital, 
nondeductible expense at the close of the last tax year to which it may 
be carried. However, when a tax attribute attributable to S is reduced 
as required pursuant to Sec. 1.1502-28T(a)(3), the reduction of the tax 
attribute is not treated as a noncapital, nondeductible expense of S. 
Finally, if S sells and repurchases a security subject to section 1091, 
the disallowed loss is not a noncapital, nondeductible expense because 
the corresponding basis adjustments under section 1091(d) prevent the 
disallowance from being permanent.
    (b)(3)(iii)(B) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1502-
32(b)(3)(iii)(B).
    (b)(3)(iii)(C) Loss suspended under Sec. 1.1502-35T(c). Any loss 
suspended pursuant to Sec. 1.1502-35T(c) is treated as a noncapital, 
nondeductible expense incurred during the taxable year that includes the 
date of the disposition to which such section applies. See Sec. 1.1502-
35T(c)(3). Consequently, the basis of a higher-tier member's stock of P 
is reduced by the suspended loss in the year it is suspended.
    (D) Loss disallowed under Sec. 1.1502-35T(g)(3)(iii). Any loss or 
deduction the use of which is disallowed pursuant to Sec. 1.1502-
35T(g)(3)(iii) (other than a loss or deduction described in Sec. 
1.1502-35T(g)(3)(i)(B)(11)), and with respect to which no waiver 
described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section is filed, is treated as a 
noncapital, nondeductible expense incurred during the taxable year that 
such loss would otherwise be absorbed. See Sec. 1.1502-35T(g)(3)(iv).
    (b)(3)(iv) through (b)(4)(iv) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see 
Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(3)(iv) through (b)(4)(iv).
    (b)(4)(v) Special rule for loss carryovers of a subsidiary acquired 
in a trasaction for which an election under Sec. 1.1502-20T(i)(2) is 
made--(A) Expired losses. Notwithstanding Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(4)(iv), to 
the extent that S's loss carryovers are increased by reason of an 
election under Sec. 1.1502-20T(i)(2) and such loss carryovers expire or 
would have been properly used to offset income in a taxable year for 
which the refund of an

[[Page 397]]

overpayment is prevented by any law or rule of law as of the date the 
group files its original return for the taxable year in which S receives 
the notification described in Sec. 1.1502-20T(i)(3)(iv) and at all 
times thereafter, the group will be deemed to have made an election 
under Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(4) to treat all of such expired loss carryovers 
as expiring for all Federal income tax purposes immediately before S 
became a member of the consolidated group.
    (B) Available losses. Notwithstanding Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(4)(iv), to 
the extent that S's loss carryovers are increased by reason of an 
election under Sec. 1.1502-20T(i)(2) and such loss carryovers have not 
expired and would not have been properly used to offset income in a 
taxable year for which the refund of an overpayment is prevented by any 
law or rule of law as of the date the group files its original return 
for the taxable year in which S receives the notification described in 
Sec. 1.1502-20T(i)(3)(iv) and at all times thereafter, the group may 
make an election under Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(4) to treat all or a portion 
of such loss carryovers as expiring for all Federal income tax purposes 
immediately before S became a member of the consolidated group. Such 
election must be filed with the group's original return for the taxable 
year in which S receives the notification described in Sec. 1.1502-
20T(i)(3)(iv).
    (C) Effective date. This paragraph (b)(4)(v) is applicable on and 
after March 7, 2002.
    (b)(4)(vi) Special rules in the case of certain transactions subject 
to Sec. 1.1502-35T. If a member of a consolidated group transfers stock 
of a subsidiary member and such stock has a basis that exceeds its value 
immediately before such transfer or a subsidiary member is 
deconsolidated and any stock of such subsidiary member owned by members 
of the group immediately before such deconsolidation has a basis that 
exceeds its value, all members of the group are subject to the 
provisions of Sec. 1.1502-35T(b), which generally require a 
redetermination of members' basis in all shares of subsidiary stock. In 
addition, if stock of a subsidiary member is treated as worthless under 
section 165 (taking into account the provisions of Sec. 1.1502-80(c)), 
or if a member of a group disposes of subsidiary member stock and on the 
following day the subsidiary is not a member of the group and does not 
have a separate return year, and the common parent makes an election 
under Sec. 1.1502-35T(f)(2) to reattribute to itself the losses treated 
as attributable to such subsidiary member, Sec. 1.1502-35T(f)(2) 
requires a reduction of members' basis in shares of subsidiary stock.
    (vii) Special rules for amending waiver of loss carryovers from 
separate return limitation year--(A) Waivers that increased allowable 
loss or reduced basis reduction required. If, in connection with the 
acquisition of S, the group made an election pursuant to Sec. 1.1502-
32(b)(4) to treat all or any portion of S's loss carryovers as expiring, 
and the prior group elected to determine the amount of the allowable 
loss or the basis reduction required with respect to the stock of S or a 
higher-tier corporation of S by applying the provisions described in 
Sec. 1.1502-20T(i)(2)(i) or (ii), then the group may reduce the amount 
of any loss carryover deemed to expire (or increase the amount of any 
loss carryover deemed not to expire) as a result of the election made 
pursuant to Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(4). The aggregate amount of loss 
carryovers that may be treated as not expiring as a result of amendments 
made pursuant to this paragraph (b)(4)(vii)(A) with respect to S and any 
higher- and lower-tier corporation of S may not exceed the amount 
described in Sec. 1.1502-20(c)(1)(iii) with respect to the acquired 
stock (computed without regard to the effect of the group's election or 
elections pursuant to Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(4), but with regard to the 
effect of the prior group's election pursuant to Sec. 1.1502-20(g), if 
any, prior to the application of Sec. 1.1502-20T(i)(3)). For purposes 
of determining the aggregate amount of loss carryovers that may be 
treated as not expiring as a result of amendments made pursuant to this 
paragraph (b)(4)(vii)(A) with respect to S and any higher- and lower-
tier corporation of S, the group may rely on a written notification 
provided by the prior group. Nothing in this paragraph shall be 
construed as permitting a group to increase the amount of any loss 
carryover deemed to expire (or reduce the amount of any loss carryover

[[Page 398]]

deemed not to expire) as a result of the election made pursuant to Sec. 
1.1502-32(b)(4).
    (B) Inadvertent waivers of loss carryovers previously subject to an 
election described in Sec. 1.1502-20(g). If, in connection with the 
acquisition of S, the group made an election pursuant to Sec. 1.1502-
32(b)(4) to waive loss carryovers of S by identifying the amount of each 
loss carryover deemed not to expire, the prior group elected to 
determine the amount of the allowable loss or the basis reduction 
required with respect to the stock of S or a higher-tier corporation of 
S by applying the provisions described in Sec. 1.1502-20T(i)(2)(i) or 
(ii), and the amount of S's loss carryovers treated as reattributed to 
the prior group pursuant to the election described in Sec. 1.1502-20(g) 
is reduced pursuant to Sec. 1.1502-20T(i)(3), then the group may amend 
its election made pursuant to Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(4) to provide that all 
or a portion of the loss carryovers of S that are treated as loss 
carryovers of S as a result of the prior group's election to apply the 
provisions described in Sec. 1.1502-20T(i)(2)(i) or (ii) are deemed not 
to expire. This paragraph (b)(4)(vii)(B), however, does not permit a 
group to reduce the amount of any loss carryover deemed not to expire as 
a result of the election made pursuant to Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(4).
    (C) Time and manner of amending an election under Sec. 1.1502-
32(b)(4). The amendment of an election made pursuant to Sec. 1.1502-
32(b)(4) must be made in a statement entitled Amendment of Election to 
Treat Loss Carryover as Expiring Under Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(4) Pursuant to 
Sec. 1.1502-32T(b)(4)(vii). The statement must be filed with or as part 
of any timely filed (including extensions) original return for the 
taxable year that includes May 7, 2003 or with or as part of an amended 
return filed before the date the original return for the taxable year 
that includes May 7, 2003 is due (with regard to extensions). A separate 
statement shall be filed for each election made pursuant to Sec. 
1.1502-32(b)(4) that is being amended pursuant to this paragraph 
(b)(4)(vii). For purposes of making this statement, the group may rely 
on the statements set forth in a written notification provided by the 
prior group. The statement filed under this paragraph must include the 
following--
    (1) The name and employer identification number (E.I.N.) of S;
    (2) In the case of an amendment made pursuant to paragraph 
(b)(4)(vii)(A), a statement that the group has received a written 
notification from the prior group confirming that the group's prior 
election or elections pursuant to Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(4) had the effect 
of either increasing the prior group's allowable loss on the disposition 
of subsidiary stock or reducing the prior group's amount of basis 
reduction required;
    (3) The amount of each loss carryover of S deemed to expire (or the 
amount of loss carryover deemed not to expire) as set forth in the 
election made pursuant to Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(4);
    (4) The amended amount of each loss carryover of S deemed to expire 
(or the amended amount of loss carryover deemed not to expire); and
    (5) In the case of an amendment made pursuant to paragraph 
(b)(4)(vii)(A) of this section, a statement that the aggregate amount of 
loss carryovers of S and any higher- and lower-tier corporation of S 
that will be treated as not expiring as a result of amendments made 
pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(vii)(A) of this section will not exceed the 
amount described in Sec. 1.1502-20(c)(1)(iii) with respect to the 
acquired stock (computed without regard to the effect of the group's 
election or elections pursuant to Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(4), but with regard 
to the effect of the prior group's election pursuant to Sec. 1.1502-
20(g), if any, prior to the application of Sec. 1.1502-20T(i)(3)).
    (D) Items taken into account in open years. An amendment to an 
election made pursuant to Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(4) affects the group's 
items of income, gain, deduction or loss only to the extent that the 
amendment gives rise, directly or indirectly, to items or amounts that 
would properly be taken into account in a year for which an assessment 
of deficiency or a refund for overpayment, as the case may be, is not 
prevented by any law or rule of law. Under this paragraph, if the year 
to which a loss previously deemed to expire as a result of an election 
made pursuant to Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(4) is deemed not to expire as a 
result of an election made pursuant to this paragraph would

[[Page 399]]

have been carried back or carried forward is a year for which a refund 
of overpayment is prevented by law, then to the extent that the 
absorption of such loss in such year would have affected the tax 
treatment of another item (e.g., another loss that was absorbed in such 
year) that has an effect in a year for which a refund of overpayment is 
not prevented by any law or rule of law, the amendment to the election 
made pursuant to Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(4) will affect the treatment of such 
other item. Therefore, if the absorption of such loss (the first loss) 
in a year for which a refund of overpayment is prevented by law would 
have prevented the absorption of another loss (the second loss) in such 
year and such second loss would have been carried to and used in a year 
for which a refund of overpayment is not prevented by any law or rule of 
law (the other year), the amendment of the election makes the second 
loss available for use in the other year.
    (E) Higher- and lower-tier corporations of S. A higher-tier 
corporation of S is a corporation that was a member of the prior group 
and, as a result of such higher-tier corporation becoming a member of 
the group, S became a member of the group. A lower-tier corporation of S 
is a corporation that was a member of the prior group and became a 
member of the group as a result of S becoming a member of the group.
    (F) Effective date. This paragraph (b)(4)(vii) is applicable on and 
after May 7, 2003.
    (b)(5)(i) through (b)(5)(ii), Example 3 [Reserved]. For further 
guidance, see Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(5)(i) through (b)(5)(ii), Example 3.

    Example 4. Discharge of indebtedness. (a) Facts. P forms S on 
January 1 of Year 1 and S borrows $200. During Year 1, S's assets 
decline in value and the P group has a $100 consolidated net operating 
loss. Of that amount, $10 is attributable to P and $90 is attributable 
to S under the principles of Sec. 1.1502-21T(b)(2)(iv). None of the 
loss is absorbed by the group in Year 1, and S is discharged from $100 
of indebtedness at the close of Year 1. P has a $0 basis in the S stock. 
P and S have no attributes other than the consolidated net operating 
loss. Under section 108(a), S's $100 of discharge of indebtedness income 
is excluded from gross income because of insolvency. Under section 
108(b) and Sec. 1.1502-28T, the consolidated net operating loss is 
reduced to $0.
    (b) Analysis. Under Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(3)(iii)(B), the reduction of 
$90 of the consolidated net operating loss attributable to S is treated 
as a noncapital, nondeductible expense in Year 1 because that loss is 
permanently disallowed by section 108(b) and Sec. 1.1502-28T. Under 
paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(C)(1) of this section, all $100 of S's discharge of 
indebtedness income is treated as tax-exempt income in Year 1 because 
the discharge results in a $100 reduction to the consolidated net 
operating loss. Consequently, the loss and the cancellation of the 
indebtedness result in a net positive $10 adjustment to P's basis in its 
S stock.
    (c) Insufficient attributes. The facts are the same as in paragraph 
(a) of this Example 4, except that S is discharged from $120 of 
indebtedness at the close of Year 1. Under section 108(a), S's $120 of 
discharge of indebtedness income is excluded from gross income because 
of insolvency. Under section 108(b) and Sec. 1.1502-28T, the 
consolidated net operating loss is reduced to $0 at the close of Year 1. 
Under Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(3)(iii)(B), the reduction of $90 of the 
consolidated net operating loss attributable to S is treated as a 
noncapital, nondeductible expense. Under paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(C)(1) of 
this section, only $100 of the discharge is treated as tax-exempt income 
because only that amount is applied to reduce tax attributes. The 
remaining $20 of discharge income excluded under section 108(a) has no 
effect on P's basis in S's stock.

    (b)(5)(ii), Example 4(d) through (h)(5)(ii) [Reserved]. For further 
guidance, see Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(5)(ii), Example 4(d) through 
(h)(5)(ii).
    (h)(6) Loss suspended under Sec. 1.1502-35T(c) or disallowed under 
Sec. 1.1502-35T(g)(3)(iii). Paragraphs (a)(2), (b)(3)(iii)(C), 
(b)(3)(iii)(D) and (b)(4)(vi) of this section are effective on and after 
March 7, 2002, and expire on March 11, 2006.
    (h)(7) Rules related to discharges of indebtedness excluded from 
gross income. Paragraphs (b)(3)(ii)(C)(1), (b)(3)(iii)(A), and 
(b)(5)(ii), Example 4, paragraphs (a), (b), and (c), of this section 
apply with respect to determinations of the basis of the stock of a 
subsidiary in consolidated return years the original return for which is 
due (without extensions) after August 29, 2003. For determinations in 
consolidated return years the original return for which is due (without 
extensions) on or before August 29, 2003, groups may apply paragraphs 
(b)(3)(ii)(C)(1), (b)(3)(iii)(A), and (b)(5)(ii), Example 4, paragraphs 
(a), (b),

[[Page 400]]

and (c), of this section without regard to the references to Sec. 
1.1502-28T or, alternatively, apply paragraphs (b)(3)(ii)(C)(1), 
(b)(3)(iii)(A), and (b)(5)(ii), Example 4, paragraphs (a), (b), and (c), 
of Sec. 1.1502-32 as contained in 26 CFR part 1 edition revised as of 
April 1, 2003.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1502-33  Earnings and profits.

    (a) In general--(1) Purpose. This section provides rules for 
adjusting the earnings and profits of a subsidiary (S) and any member 
(P) owning S's stock. These rules modify the determination of P's 
earnings and profits under applicable rules of law, including section 
312, by adjusting P's earnings and profits to reflect S's earnings and 
profits for the period that S is a member of the consolidated group. The 
purpose for modifying the determination of earnings and profits is to 
treat P and S as a single entity by reflecting the earnings and profits 
of lower-tier members in the earnings and profits of higher-tier members 
and consolidating the group's earnings and profits in the common parent. 
References in this section to earnings and profits include deficits in 
earnings and profits.
    (2) Application of other rules of law. The rules of this section are 
in addition to other rules of law. For example, the allowance for 
depreciation is determined in accordance with section 312(k). P's 
earnings and profits must not be adjusted under this section and other 
rules of law in a manner that has the effect of duplicating an 
adjustment. For example, if S's earnings and profits are reflected in 
P's earnings and profits under paragraph (b) of this section, and S 
transfers its assets to P in a liquidation to which section 332 applies, 
S's earnings and profits that P succeeds to under section 381 must be 
adjusted to prevent duplication.
    (b) Tiering up earnings and profits--(1) General rule. P's earnings 
and profits are adjusted under this section to reflect changes in S's 
earnings and profits in accordance with the applicable principles of 
Sec. 1.1502-32, consistently applied, and an adjustment to P's earnings 
and profits for a tax year under this paragraph (b)(1) is treated as 
earnings and profits of P for the tax year in which the adjustment 
arises. Under these principles, for example, the adjustments are made as 
of the close of each consolidated return year, and as of any other time 
if a determination at that time is necessary to determine the earnings 
and profits of any person. Similarly, S's earnings and profits are 
allocated under the principles of Sec. 1.1502-32(c), and the 
adjustments are applied in the order of the tiers, from the lowest to 
the highest. However, modifications to the principles include:
    (i) The amount of P's adjustment is determined by reference to S's 
earnings and profits, rather than S's taxable and tax-exempt items (and 
therefore, for example, the deferral of a negative adjustment for S's 
unabsorbed losses does not apply).
    (ii) The tax sharing rules under paragraph (d) of this section apply 
rather than those of Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(3)(iv)(D).
    (2) Affiliated earnings and profits. The reduction in S's earnings 
and profits under section 312 from a distribution of earnings and 
profits accumulated in separate return years of S that are not separate 
return limitation years does not tier up to P's earnings and profits. 
Thus, the increase in P's earnings and profits under section 312 from 
receipt of the distribution is not offset by a corresponding reduction.
    (3) Examples--(i) In general. For purposes of the examples in this 
section, unless otherwise stated, P owns all of the only class of S's 
stock, the stock is owned for the entire year, S owns no stock of lower-
tier members, the tax year of all persons is the calendar year, all 
persons use the accrual method of accounting, the facts set forth the 
only corporate activity, preferred stock is described in section 
1504(a)(4), all transactions are between unrelated persons, and tax 
liabilities are disregarded.
    (ii) Tiering up earnings and profits. The principles of this 
paragraph (b) are illustrated by the following examples.

    Example 1. Tier-up and distribution of earnings and profits. (a) 
Facts. P forms S in Year 1 with a $100 contribution. S has $100 of 
earnings and profits for Year 1 and no earnings and profits for Year 2. 
During Year 2, S declares and distributes a $50 dividend to P.

[[Page 401]]

    (b) Analysis. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, S's $100 of 
earnings and profits for Year 1 increases P's earnings and profits for 
Year 1. P has no additional earnings and profits for Year 2 as a result 
of the $50 distribution in Year 2, because there is a $50 increase in 
P's earnings and profits as a result of the receipt of the dividend and 
a corresponding $50 decrease in S's earnings and profits under section 
312(a) that is reflected in P's earnings and profits under paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section.
    (c) Distribution of current earnings and profits. The facts are the 
same as in paragraph (a) of this Example 1, except that S distributes 
the $50 dividend at the end of Year 1 rather than during Year 2. Under 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, P's earnings and profits are increased 
by $100 (S's $50 of undistributed earnings and profits, plus P's receipt 
of the $50 distribution). Thus, S's earnings and profits increase by $50 
and P's earnings and profits increase by $100.
    (d) Affiliated earnings and profits. The facts are the same as in 
paragraph (a) of this Example 1, except that P and S do not begin filing 
consolidated returns until Year 2. Because P and S file separate returns 
for Year 1, P's basis in S's stock remains $100 under Sec. 1.1502-32 
and this section, S has $100 of earnings and profits, and none of S's 
earnings and profits is reflected in P's earnings and profits under 
paragraph (b) of this section. S's distribution in Year 2 ordinarily 
would reduce S's earnings and profits but not increase P's earnings and 
profits. (P's $50 of earnings and profits from the dividend would be 
offset by S's $50 reduction in earnings and profits that tiers up under 
paragraph (b) of this section.) However, under paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section, the negative adjustment for S's distribution to P does not 
apply. Thus, S's distribution reduces its earnings and profits by $50 
but increases P's earnings and profits by $50. (If S's earnings and 
profits had been accumulated in a separate return limitation year, 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section would not apply and the distribution 
would reduce S's earnings and profits but not increase P's earnings and 
profits.)
    (e) Earnings and profits deficit. Assume instead that after P forms 
S in Year 1 with a $100 contribution, S borrows additional funds and has 
a $150 deficit in earnings and profits for Year 1. The corresponding 
loss for tax purposes is not absorbed in Year 1, and is included in the 
group's consolidated net operating loss carried forward to Year 2. Under 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, however, S's $150 deficit in earnings 
and profits decreases P's earnings and profits for Year 1 by $150. 
(Absorption of the loss in a later tax year has no effect on the 
earnings and profits of P and S.)
    Example 2. Section 355 distribution. (a) Facts. P owns all of S's 
stock and S owns all of T's stock. For Year 1, T has $100 of earnings 
and profits. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the earnings and 
profits of T tier up to S and to P. S and P have no other earnings and 
profits for Year 1. S distributes T's stock to P at the end of Year 1 in 
a distribution to which section 355 applies.
    (b) Analysis. Because S's distribution of T's stock is a 
distribution to which section 355 applies, the applicable principles of 
Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(2)(iv) do not require P's earnings and profits to be 
adjusted by reason of the distribution. In addition, although S's 
earnings and profits may be reduced under section 312(h) as a result of 
the distribution, the applicable principles of Sec. 1.1502-
32(b)(3)(iii) do not require P's earnings and profits to be adjusted to 
reflect this reduction in S's earnings and profits.
    Example 3. Allocating earnings and profits among shares. P owns 80% 
of S's stock throughout Year 1. For Year 1, S has $100 of earnings and 
profits. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, $80 of S's earnings and 
profits is allocated to P based on P's ownership of S's stock. 
Accordingly, $80 of S's earnings and profits for Year 1 is reflected in 
P's earnings and profits for Year 1.

    (c) Special rules. For purposes of this section--
    (1) Stock of members. For purposes of determining P's earnings and 
profits from the disposition of S's stock, P's basis in S's stock is 
adjusted to reflect S's earnings and profits determined under paragraph 
(b) of this section, rather than under Sec. 1.1502-32. For example, P's 
basis in S's stock is increased by positive earnings and profits and 
decreased by deficits in earnings and profits. Similarly, P's basis in 
S's stock is not reduced for distributions to which paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section applies (affiliated earnings and profits). P may have an 
excess loss account in S's stock for earnings and profits purposes 
(whether or not there is an excess loss account under Sec. 1.1502-32), 
and the excess loss account is determined, adjusted, and taken into 
account in accordance with the principles of Sec. Sec. 1.1502-19 and 
1.1502-32.
    (2) Intercompany transactions. Intercompany items and corresponding 
items are not reflected in earnings and profits before they are taken 
into account under Sec. 1.1502-13. See Sec. 1.1502-13 for the 
applicable rules and definitions.
    (3) Example. The principles of this paragraph (c) are illustrated by 
the following example.


[[Page 402]]


    Example. Adjustments to stock basis. (a) Facts. P forms S in Year 1 
with a $100 contribution. For Year 1, S has $75 of taxable income and 
$100 of earnings and profits. For Year 2, S has no taxable income or 
earnings and profits, and S declares and distributes a $50 dividend to 
P. P sells all of S's stock for $150 at the end of Year 2.
    (b) Analysis. Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, P's basis in 
S's stock for earnings and profits purposes immediately before the sale 
is $150 (the $100 initial basis, plus S's $100 of earnings and profits 
for Year 1, minus the $50 distribution of earnings and profits in Year 
2). Thus, P recognizes no gain or loss from the sale of S's stock for 
earnings and profits purposes.
    (c) Earnings and profits deficit. Assume instead that S has a $100 
tax loss and earnings and profits deficit for Year 1. The tax loss is 
not absorbed in Year 1 and is included in the group's consolidated net 
operating loss carried forward to Year 2. Under paragraph (b) of this 
section, S's $100 deficit in earnings and profits decreases P's earnings 
and profits for Year 1. Under paragraph (c) of this section, P decreases 
its basis in S's stock for purposes of determining earnings and profits 
from $100 to $0. (If S had borrowed an additional $50 that it also lost 
in Year 1, P would have decreased its earnings and profits for Year 1 by 
the additional $50, and P would have had a $50 excess loss account in 
S's stock for earnings and profits purposes, which would be taken into 
account in determining P's earnings and profits from its sale of S's 
stock.)
    (d) Affiliated earnings and profits. Assume instead that P and S do 
not begin filing consolidated returns until Year 2. Under paragraph (b) 
of this section, the negative adjustment under Sec. 1.1502-32(b) for 
distributions does not apply to S's distribution of earnings and profits 
accumulated in a separate return year that is a not separate return 
limitation year. Thus, P's basis in S's stock for earnings and profits 
purposes remains $100, and P has $50 of earnings and profits from the 
sale of S's stock.

    (d) Federal income tax liability--(1) In general--(i) Extension of 
tax allocations. Section 1552 allocates the tax liability of a 
consolidated group among its members for purposes of determining the 
amounts by which their earnings and profits are reduced for taxes. 
Section 1552 does not reflect the absorption by one member of another 
member's tax attributes (e.g., losses, deductions and credits). For 
example, if P's $100 of income is offset by S's $100 of deductions, 
consolidated tax liability is $0 and no amount is allocated under 
section 1552. However, the group may elect under this paragraph (d) to 
allocate additional amounts to reflect the absorption by one member of 
the tax attributes of another member. Permissible methods are set forth 
in paragraphs (d)(2) through (4) of this section, and election 
procedures are provided in paragraph (d)(5) of this section. Allocations 
under this paragraph (d) must be reflected annually on permanent records 
(including work papers). Any computations of separate return tax 
liability are subject to the principles of section 1561.
    (ii) Effect of extended tax allocations. The amounts allocated under 
this paragraph (d) are treated as allocations of tax liability for 
purposes of Sec. 1.1552-1(b)(2). For example, if P's taxable income is 
offset by S's loss, and tax liability is allocated under the percentage 
method of paragraph (d)(3) of this section, P's earnings and profits are 
reduced as if its income were subject to tax, P is treated as liable to 
S for the amount of the tax, and corresponding adjustments are made to 
S's earnings and profits. If the liability of one member to another is 
not paid, the amount not paid generally is treated as a distribution, 
contribution, or both, depending on the relationship between the 
members.
    (2) Wait-and-see method. The wait-and-see method under this 
paragraph (d)(2) is derived from Securities and Exchange Commission 
procedures. In the year that a member's tax attribute is absorbed, the 
group's consolidated tax liability is allocated in accordance with the 
group's method under section 1552. When, in effect, the member with the 
tax attribute could have absorbed the attribute on a separate return 
basis in a later year, a portion of the group's consolidated tax 
liability for the later year that is otherwise allocated to members 
under section 1552 is reallocated. The reallocation takes into account 
all consolidated return years to which this paragraph (d) applies (the 
computation period), and is determined by comparing the tax allocated to 
a member during the computation period with the member's tax liability 
determined as if it had filed separate returns during the computation 
period.
    (i) Cap on allocation under section 1552. A member's allocation 
under section

[[Page 403]]

1552 for a tax year may not exceed the excess, if any, of--
    (A) The total of the tax liabilities of the member for the 
computation period (including the current year), determined as if the 
member had filed separate returns; over
    (B) The total amount allocated to the member under section 1552 and 
this paragraph (d) for the computation period (except the current year).
    (ii) Reallocation of capped amounts. To the extent that the amount 
allocated to a member under section 1552 exceeds the limitation under 
paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, the excess is allocated among the 
remaining members in proportion to (but not to exceed the amount of) 
each member's excess, if any, of--
    (A) The total of the tax liabilities of the member for the 
computation period (including the current year), determined as if the 
member had filed separate returns; over
    (B) The total amount allocated to the member under section 1552 and 
this paragraph (d) for the computation period (including for the current 
year only the amount allocated under section 1552).
    (iii) Reallocation of excess capped amounts. If the reductions under 
paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section exceed the amounts allocable under 
paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, the excess is allocated among the 
members in accordance with the group's method under section 1552 without 
taking this paragraph (d)(2) into account.
    (3) Percentage method. The percentage method under this paragraph 
(d)(3) allocates tax liability based on the absorption of tax 
attributes, without taking into account the ability of any member to 
subsequently absorb its own tax attributes. The allocation under this 
method is in addition to the allocation under section 1552.
    (i) Decreased earnings and profits. A member's allocation under 
section 1552 for any year is increased, thereby decreasing its earnings 
and profits, by a fixed percentage (not to exceed 100%) of the excess, 
if any, of--
    (A) The member's separate return tax liability for the consolidated 
return year as determined under Sec. 1.1552-1(a)(2)(ii); over
    (B) The amount allocated to the member under section 1552.
    (ii) Increased earnings and profits. An amount equal to the total 
decrease in earnings and profits under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this 
section (including amounts allocated as a result of a carryback) 
increases the earnings and profits of the members whose attributes are 
absorbed, and is allocated among them in a manner that reasonably 
reflects the absorption of the tax attributes.
    (4) Additional methods. The absorption by one member of the tax 
attributes of another member may be reflected under any other method 
approved in writing by the Commissioner.
    (5) Election of allocation method--(i) In general. Tax liability may 
be allocated under this paragraph (d) only if an election is filed with 
the group's first return. The election must--
    (A) Be made in a separate statement entitled ``ELECTION TO ALLOCATE 
TAX LIABILITY UNDER Sec. 1.1502-33(d)'';
    (B) State the allocation method elected under Sec. 1.1502-33(d) and 
under section 1552;
    (C) If the percentage method is elected, state the percentage (not 
to exceed 100%) to be used; and
    (D) If a method is permitted under paragraph (d)(4) of this section, 
attach evidence of approval of the method by the Commissioner.
    (ii) Consent--(A) Electing or changing methods. An election for a 
later year, or an election to change methods, may be made only with the 
written consent of the Commissioner.
    (B) Prior law elections. An election in effect for the last tax year 
beginning before January 1, 1995, remains in effect under this section. 
However, a group may elect to conform its earnings and profits 
computations to the method described in Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(3)(iv)(D) 
(the percentage method, using a 100% allocation), whether or not it has 
previously made an election for earnings and profits purposes. If a 
conforming election is made, the group must make all adjustments 
necessary to prevent amounts from being duplicated or omitted. The 
conforming election is made by attaching a statement entitled ``ELECTION 
TO CONFORM

[[Page 404]]

TAX ALLOCATIONS UNDER Sec. Sec. 1.1502-32 and 1.1502-33(d)'' to the 
consolidated group's return for its first tax year beginning on or after 
January 1, 1995. The statement must be signed by the common parent, and 
must specify whether the method is conformed only for years beginning on 
or after January 1, 1995 or as if the method were in effect for all 
prior years. The statement must also describe the adjustments made by 
reason of the change (e.g., to reflect prior use of earnings and 
profits).
    (6) Examples. The principles of this paragraph (d) are illustrated 
by the following examples.

    Example 1. Wait-and-see method. (a) Facts. P owns all of the stock 
of S1 and S2. The P group uses the wait-and-see method of allocation 
under paragraph (d)(2) of this section in conjunction with Sec. 1.1552-
1(a)(1). For Year 1, each member's taxable income, both for purposes of 
Sec. 1.1552-1(a)(1) and redetermined as if the member had filed 
separate returns, is as follows: P $0, S1 $2,000, and S2 ($1,000). Thus, 
the P group's consolidated tax liability for Year 1 is $340 (assuming a 
34% tax rate).
    (b) Analysis. Under Sec. 1.1552-1(a)(1)(i), the tax liability of 
the P group is allocated among the members in accordance with the 
portion of the consolidated taxable income attributable to each member 
having taxable income. Thus, all of the P group's $340 consolidated tax 
liability is allocated to S1. As a result, S1 decreases its earnings and 
profits under section 1552 by $340 (even if S1 does not pay the tax 
liability). No further allocations are made under paragraph (d)(2) of 
this section because S2 cannot yet absorb its loss on a separate return 
basis.
    (c) Payment of tax liability. If S1 pays the $340 tax liability, 
there is no further effect on the income, earnings and profits, or stock 
basis of any member. If P pays the $340 tax liability (and the payment 
is not a loan from P to S1), P is treated as making a $340 contribution 
to the capital of S1; if S2 pays the $340 tax liability (and the payment 
is not a loan from S2 to S1), S2 is treated as making a $340 
distribution to P with respect to its stock, and P is treated as making 
a $340 contribution to the capital of S1. See Sec. 1.1552-1(b)(2).
    (d) Year 2. For Year 2, each member's taxable income, under Sec. 
1.1552-1(a)(1)(ii) and redetermined as if the member had filed separate 
returns, without taking into account any carryover from Year 1, is as 
follows: P $0, S1 $1,000, and S2 $3,000. Thus, the P group's 
consolidated tax liability for Year 2 is $1,360 (assuming a 34% tax 
rate). Of this amount, section 1552 would allocate $340 to S1 and $1,020 
to S2. However, under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, no more than 
$680 may be allocated to S2. This is because S2 would have had an 
aggregate tax liability of $680 if it had filed separate returns for 
Years 1 and 2 (a $0 tax liability for Year 1, and a $680 tax liability 
for Year 2, taking into account a $1,000 net operating loss carryover 
from Year 1). Under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, the entire 
excess of $340 which would otherwise be allocated to S2 under Sec. 
1.1552-1(a)(1) is allocated to S1. This is because S1 would have had an 
additional $340 of aggregate tax liability if it had filed separate 
returns for Years 1 and 2 (a $680 tax liability for Year 1, and a $340 
tax liability for Year 2, not taking into account S2's $1,000 net 
operating loss for Year 1). The effect of the allocation of $680 to S1 
and $680 to S2 is determined under Sec. 1.1552-1(b)(2).
    Example 2. Percentage method. (a) Facts. The facts are the same as 
in Example 1, but the P group uses the percentage method of allocation 
under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, with a percentage of 100%. In 
addition, the taxable incomes and losses of the members are the same if 
computed as provided in Sec. 1.1552-1(a)(2)(ii).
    (b) Analysis. Under Sec. 1.1552-1(a)(2)(ii), $340 of tax liability 
is allocated to S1 for Year 1. Under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this 
section, S1 is allocated another $340 of tax liability because S1 would 
have had a $680 tax liability if it had filed separate returns but only 
$340 is allocated to S1 under section 1552. Thus, S1's earnings and 
profits are decreased by the $680 total. Under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of 
this section, S2's earnings and profits are increased by $340 because 
the additional $340 allocated to S1 under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this 
section is attributable to the absorption of S2's losses.
    (c) Payment of tax liability. If S1 pays the $340 tax liability of 
the P group and pays $340 to S2, the Year 1 tax liability results in no 
further adjustments to the income, earnings and profits, or basis of any 
member's stock. If S1 pays the $340 tax liability of the P group and 
pays the other $340 to P instead of S2 because, for example, of an 
agreement among the members, S2 is treated as distributing $340 to P 
with respect to its stock in the year that S1 makes the payment to P. 
See Sec. 1.1552-1(b)(2).
    (d) Year 2. For Year 2, $340 is allocated to S1 and $1,020 is 
allocated to S2 under section 1552. No additional amounts are allocated 
under paragraph (d)(3) of this section.

    (e) Deconsolidations--(1) In general. Immediately before it becomes 
a nonmember, S's earnings and profits are eliminated to the extent they 
were taken into account by any member under this section. If S's 
earnings and

[[Page 405]]

profits are eliminated under this paragraph (e)(1), no corresponding 
adjustment is made to the earnings and profits of P (or any other 
member) under paragraph (b) of this section or to any basis in a 
member's stock under paragraph (c) of this section. For this purpose, S 
is treated as becoming a nonmember on the first day of its first 
separate return year (including another group's consolidated return 
year).
    (2) Acquisition of group--(i) Application. This paragraph (e)(2) 
applies only if a consolidated group (the terminating group) ceases to 
exist as a result of--
    (A) The acquisition by a member of another consolidated group of 
either the assets of the common parent of the terminating group in a 
reorganization described in section 381(a)(2), or the stock of the 
common parent of the terminating group; or
    (B) The application of the principles of Sec. 1.1502-75(d)(2) or 
(d)(3).
    (ii) General rule. Paragraph (e)(1) of this section does not apply 
solely by reason of the termination of a group because it is acquired, 
if there is a surviving group that is, immediately thereafter, a 
consolidated group. Instead, the surviving group is treated as the 
terminating group for purposes of applying this paragraph (e) to the 
terminating group. This treatment does not apply, however, to members of 
the terminating group that are not members of the surviving consolidated 
group immediately after the terminating group ceases to exist (e.g., 
under section 1504(a)(3) relating to reconsolidation, or section 1504(c) 
relating to includible insurance companies).
    (3) Certain corporate separations and reorganizations. The 
adjustments under paragraph (e)(1) of this section must be modified to 
the extent necessary to effectuate the principles of section 312(h). 
Thus, P's earnings and profits rather than S's earnings and profits may 
be eliminated immediately before S becomes a nonmember. P's earnings and 
profits are eliminated to the extent that its earnings and profits 
reflect S's earnings and profits after applying section 312(h) 
immediately after S becomes a nonmember (determined without taking this 
paragraph (e) into account).
    (4) Special uses of earnings and profits. Paragraph (e)(1) of this 
section does not apply for purposes of determining--
    (i) The extent to which a distribution is charged to reserve 
accounts under section 593(e);
    (ii) The extent to which a distribution is taxable to the recipient 
under sections 805(a)(4) and 832; and
    (iii) Any other special use identified in guidance published in the 
Internal Revenue Bulletin.
    (5) Example. The principles of this paragraph (e) are illustrated by 
the following example.

    Example. (a) Facts. Individuals A and B own all of P's stock, and P 
owns all of the stock of S and T, each with a $500 basis. For Year 1, S 
has $100 of earnings and profits and T has $50 of earnings and profits. 
Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the earnings and profits of S 
and T tier up to P, and P has $150 of earnings and profits for Year 1. P 
sells all of S's stock for $600 at the close of Year 1.
    (b) Analysis. Under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, S's $100 of 
earnings and profits is eliminated immediately before S becomes a 
nonmember because the earnings and profits are taken into account under 
paragraph (b) of this section in P's earnings and profits. However, no 
corresponding adjustment is made to P's earnings and profits or to P's 
basis in S's stock for purposes of earnings and profits. P's earnings 
and profits for Year 1 remain $150 following the sale of S's stock.
    (c) Forward merger. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of 
this Example, except that, rather than P selling S's stock, S merges 
into a nonmember in a transaction described in section 368(a)(2)(D). 
Under paragraph (h) of this section, the nonmember is treated as a 
successor to S. Thus, as in paragraph (b) of this Example, S's $100 of 
earnings and profits is eliminated immediately before S ceases to be a 
member.
    (d) Acquisition of entire group. The facts are the same as in 
paragraph (a) of this Example, except that X, the common parent of 
another consolidated group, purchases all of P's stock at the close of 
Year 1, and P sells S's stock during Year 3. Under paragraph (e)(2) of 
this section, the earnings and profits of S and T are not eliminated as 
a result of X purchasing P's stock. However, S's earnings and profits 
from consolidated return years of both the P group and the X group are 
eliminated immediately before S becomes a nonmember of the X group.
    (e) Earnings and profits deficit. The facts are the same as in 
paragraph (d) of this Example, except that S has a $550 deficit in 
earnings and profits for Year 1. The effect of paragraph (e)(1) of this 
section is the same. Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, P would 
have

[[Page 406]]

an excess loss account in S's stock for earnings and profits purposes 
under the principles of Sec. Sec. 1.1502-19 and 1.1502-32, and, under 
the principles of Sec. 1.1502-19(c)(2), the excess loss account is not 
taken into account as a result of X's purchase of P's stock. Under 
paragraph (e)(2) of this section, S's deficit is not eliminated under 
paragraph (e)(1) of this section immediately before X's purchase of P's 
stock. However, S's earnings and profits (or deficit) is eliminated 
immediately before S becomes a nonmember of the X group.
    (f) Section 355 distribution. The facts are the same as in paragraph 
(a) of this Example, except that, rather than selling S's stock, P 
distributes S's stock to A at the close of Year 1 in a distribution to 
which section 355 applies. Under paragraph (e)(3) of this section, P's 
earnings and profits may be reduced under section 312(h) as a result of 
the distribution. To the extent that P's earnings and profits are 
reduced, S's earnings and profits are not eliminated under paragraph 
(e)(1) of this section.

    (f) Changes in the structure of the group--(1) Changes in the common 
parent--(i) General rule. If P succeeds another corporation under the 
principles of Sec. 1.1502-75(d) (2) or (3) as the common parent of a 
consolidated group (a group structure change), the earnings and profits 
of P are adjusted immediately after P becomes the new common parent to 
reflect the earnings and profits of the former common parent immediately 
before the former common parent ceases to be the common parent. The 
adjustment is made as if P succeeds to the earnings and profits of the 
former common parent in a transaction described in section 381(a). See 
Sec. 1.1502-31 for the basis of the stock of members following a group 
structure change.
    (ii) Minority shareholders. If the former common parent's stock is 
not wholly owned by members of the consolidated group immediately after 
the former common parent ceases to be the common parent, appropriate 
adjustments must be made to reflect in the new common parent only an 
allocable part of the former common parent's earnings and profits.
    (iii) Higher-tier members. To the extent that earnings and profits 
are adjusted under this paragraph (f)(1), and the former common parent 
is owned by members other than P, the earnings and profits of the 
intermediate subsidiaries must be adjusted in accordance with the 
principles of this section.
    (iv) Example. The principles of this paragraph (f)(1) are 
illustrated by the following example.

    Example. (a) Facts. X is the common parent of a consolidated group 
with $100 of earnings and profits, and P is the common parent of another 
consolidated group with $20 of earnings and profits. P acquires all of 
X's stock at the close of Year 1 in exchange for 70% of P's stock. The 
exchange is a reverse acquisition under Sec. 1.1502-75(d)(3), and the X 
group is treated as remaining in existence with P as its new common 
parent.
    (b) Adjustments for X group earnings and profits. Under paragraph 
(f)(1) of this section, P's earnings and profits are adjusted 
immediately after P becomes the new common parent, to reflect X's $100 
of earnings and profits immediately before X ceases to be the common 
parent. The adjustment is made as if P succeeds to X's earnings and 
profits in a transaction described in section 381(a). Thus, immediately 
after the acquisition, P has $120 of accumulated earnings and profits 
and X continues to have $100 of accumulated earnings and profits.
    (c) Adjustments for P group earnings and profits. Although the P 
group terminates on P's acquisition of X's stock, under paragraph (e)(2) 
of this section, no adjustments are made to the earnings and profits of 
any subsidiaries in the terminating P group.
    (d) Acquisition of separate return corporation. The facts are the 
same as in paragraph (a) of this Example, except that, immediately 
before the acquisition of its stock by P, X is not affiliated with any 
other corporation. The exchange is a reverse acquisition under Sec. 
1.1502-75(d)(3), and P is treated as the common parent of the X group. 
Consequently, the results are the same as in paragraphs (b) and (c) of 
this Example.

    (2) Change in the location of subsidiaries. If the location of a 
member within a group changes, appropriate adjustments must be made to 
the earnings and profits of the members to prevent the earnings and 
profits from being eliminated. For example, if P transfers all of S's 
stock to another member in a transaction to which section 351 and Sec. 
1.1502-13 apply, the transferee's earnings and profits are adjusted 
immediately after the transfer to reflect S's earnings and profits 
immediately before the transfer from consolidated return years. On the 
other hand, if the transferee purchases S's stock from P, the 
transferee's earnings and profits are not adjusted.
    (g) Anti-avoidance rule. If any person acts with a principal purpose 
contrary to the purposes of this section, to avoid

[[Page 407]]

the effect of the rules of this section or apply the rules of this 
section to avoid the effect of any other provision of the consolidated 
return regulations, adjustments must be made as necessary to carry out 
the purposes of this section.
    (h) Predecessors and successors. For purposes of this section, any 
reference to a corporation or to a share includes a reference to a 
successor or predecessor as the context may require. A corporation is a 
successor if its earnings and profits are determined, directly or 
indirectly, in whole or in part, by reference to the earnings and 
profits of another corporation (the predecessor). A share is a successor 
if its basis is determined, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, 
by reference to the basis of another share (the predecessor).
    (i) [Reserved]
    (j) Effective date--(1) General rule. This section applies with 
respect to determinations of the earnings and profits of a member (e.g., 
for purposes of a characterizing a distribution to which section 301 
applies) in consolidated return years beginning on or after January 1, 
1995. If this section applies, earnings and profits must be determined 
or redetermined as if this section were in effect for all years 
(including, for example, the consolidated return years of another 
consolidated group to the extent the earnings and profits from those 
years are still reflected). For example, if a distribution by P to a 
nonmember shareholder in 1990 was a dividend because of an unabsorbed 
loss carryover attributable to S, P's earnings and profits in tax years 
beginning after January 1, 1995 are redetermined by taking into account 
a negative adjustment in the tax year S's loss arose and in 1990 for P's 
distribution, and any subsequent absorption of the loss has no effect on 
earnings and profits. Any such determination or redetermination does 
not, however, affect any prior period. Thus, the shareholder's treatment 
in 1990 of the distribution as a dividend (and the effect of the 
distribution on stock basis) is not redetermined under this section.
    (2) Dispositions of stock before effective date--(i) In general. If 
P disposes of stock of S in a consolidated return year beginning before 
January 1, 1995, the amount of P's earnings and profits with respect to 
S are not redetermined under paragraph (j)(1) of this section. See Sec. 
1.1502-19 as contained in the 26 CFR part 1 edition revised as of April 
1, 1994 for the definition of disposition, and paragraph (j)(5) of this 
section for the rules applicable to such dispositions.
    (ii) Lower-tier members. Although P disposes of S's stock in a tax 
year beginning before January 1, 1995, S's determinations or adjustments 
with respect to lower-tier members with which it continues to file a 
consolidated return are redetermined in accordance with the rules of 
this section (even if S's earnings and profits were previously taken 
into account by P). For example, assume that P owns all of S's stock, S 
owns all of T's stock, and T owns all of U's stock. If S sells 80% of 
T's stock in a tax year beginning before January 1, 1995 (the effective 
date), the amount of S's earnings and profits from the sale, and the 
adjustments to stock basis for earnings and profits purposes that are 
reflected in that amount, are not redetermined if P sells S's stock 
after the effective date. If S sells the remaining 20% of T's stock 
after the effective date, S's stock basis adjustments with respect to 
that T stock are also not redetermined because T became a nonmember 
before the effective date. However, if T and U continue to file a 
consolidated return with each other, paragraph (e)(1) of this section 
did not apply, and T sells U's stock after the effective date, T's 
earnings and profits with respect to U are redetermined (even though 
some of the earnings and profits may have been taken into account by S 
in its prior sale of T's stock before the effective date).
    (iii) Deferred amounts. For purposes of this paragraph (j)(2), a 
disposition does not include a transaction to which Sec. 1.1502-13, 
Sec. 1.1502-13T, Sec. 1.1502-14, or Sec. 1.1502-14T applies. Instead, 
the transaction is deemed to occur as the earnings and profits (if any) 
are taken into account.
    (3) Deconsolidations and group structure changes--(i) In general. 
Paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section apply with respect to 
deconsolidations and group

[[Page 408]]

structure changes occurring in consolidated return years beginning on or 
after January 1, 1995.
    (ii) Prior period group structure changes. If there was a group 
structure change in a consolidated return year beginning before January 
1, 1995, and earnings and profits were not determined under Sec. 
1.1502-33T(a) as contained in the 26 CFR part 1 edition revised as of 
April 1, 1994, a distribution in a tax year ending after September 7, 
1988, of earnings and profits that are not reflected in the earnings and 
profits of the distributee member, but would have been so reflected if 
Sec. 1.1502-33T(a) as contained in the 26 CFR part 1 edition revised as 
of April 1, 1994 had applied, the negative adjustment under paragraph 
(b) of this section for distributions does not apply (and there is 
therefore no offset to the increase in the earnings and profits of the 
distributee).
    (4) Deemed dividend elections. If there is a deemed distribution and 
recontribution pursuant to Sec. 1.1502-32(f)(2) as contained in the 26 
CFR part 1 edition revised as of April 1, 1994 in a consolidated return 
year beginning before January 1, 1995, the deemed distribution and 
recontribution under the election are treated as an actual distribution 
by S and recontribution by P as provided under the election.
    (5) Prior law. For prior determinations, see prior regulations under 
section 1502 as in effect with respect to the determination. See, e.g., 
Sec. Sec. 1.1502-33 and 1.1502-33T as contained in the 26 CFR part 1 
edition revised as of April 1, 1994.

Sec. 1.1502-34  Special aggregate stock ownership rules.

    For purposes of Sec. Sec. 1.1502-1 through 1.1502-80, in 
determining the stock ownership of a member of a group in another 
corporation (the ``issuing corporation'') for purposes of determining 
the application of section 165(g)(3)(A), 332(b)(1), 333(b), 351(a), 
732(f), or 904(f), in a consolidated return year, there shall be 
included stock owned by all other members of the group in the issuing 
corporation. Thus, assume that members A, B, and C each own 33\1/3\ 
percent of the stock issued by D. In such case, A, B, and C shall each 
be treated as meeting the 80-percent stock ownership requirement for 
purposes of section 332, and no member can elect to have section 333 
apply. Furthermore, the special rule for minority shareholders in 
section 337(d) cannot apply with respect to amounts received by A, B, or 
C in liquidation of D.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1502-35T  Transfers of subsidiary member stock and deconsolidations 
of subsidiary members (temporary).

    (a) Purpose. The purpose of this section is to prevent a group from 
obtaining more than one tax benefit from a single economic loss. The 
provisions of this section shall be construed in a manner consistent 
with that purpose and in a manner that reasonably carries out that 
purpose.
    (b) Redetermination of basis on certain nondeconsolidating transfers 
of subsidiary member stock and on certain deconsolidations of subsidiary 
members--(1) Redetermination of basis on certain nondeconsolidating 
transfers of subsidiary member stock. Except as provided in paragraph 
(b)(3)(i) of this section, if, immediately after a transfer of stock of 
a subsidiary member that has a basis that exceeds its value, the 
subsidiary member remains a member of the group, then the basis in each 
share of subsidiary member stock owned by each member of the group shall 
be redetermined in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph 
(b)(1) immediately before such transfer. All of the members' bases in 
the shares of subsidiary member stock immediately before such transfer 
shall be aggregated. Such aggregated basis shall be allocated first to 
the shares of the subsidiary member's preferred stock that are owned by 
the members of the group immediately before such transfer, in proportion 
to, but not in excess of, the value of those shares at such time. After 
allocation of the aggregated basis to all shares of the preferred stock 
of the subsidiary member pursuant to the preceding sentence, any 
remaining

[[Page 409]]

basis shall be allocated among all common shares of subsidiary member 
stock held by members of the group immediately before the transfer, in 
proportion to the value of such shares at such time.
    (2) Redetermination of basis on certain deconsolidations of 
subsidiary members--(i) Allocation of reallocable basis amount. Except 
as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, if, immediately 
before a deconsolidation of a subsidiary member, any share of stock of 
such subsidiary owned by a member of the group has a basis that exceeds 
its value, then the basis in each share of the subsidiary member's stock 
owned by each member of the group shall be redetermined in accordance 
with the provisions of this paragraph (b)(2) immediately before such 
deconsolidation. The basis in each share of the subsidiary member's 
stock held by members of the group immediately before the 
deconsolidation that has a basis in excess of value at such time shall 
be reduced, but not below such share's value, in a manner that, to the 
greatest extent possible, causes the ratio of the basis to the value of 
each such share to be the same; provided, however, that the aggregate 
amount of such reduction shall not exceed the reallocable basis amount 
(as computed pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section). Then, to 
the extent of the reallocable basis amount, the basis of each share of 
the preferred stock of the subsidiary member that are held by members of 
the group immediately before the deconsolidation shall be increased, but 
not above such share's value, in a manner that, to the greatest extent 
possible, causes the ratio of the basis to the value of each such share 
to be the same. Then, to the extent that the reallocable basis amount 
does not increase the basis of shares of preferred stock of the 
subsidiary member pursuant to the third sentence of this paragraph 
(b)(2)(i), such amount shall increase the basis of all common shares of 
the subsidiary member's stock held by members of the group immediately 
before the deconsolidation in a manner that, to the greatest extent 
possible, causes the ratio of the basis to the value of each such share 
to be the same.
    (ii) Calculation of reallocable basis amount. The reallocable basis 
amount shall equal the lesser of--
    (A) The aggregate of all amounts by which, immediately before the 
deconsolidation, the basis exceeds the value of a share of subsidiary 
member stock owned by any member of the group at such time; and
    (B) The total of the subsidiary member's (and any predecessor's) 
items of deduction and loss, and the subsidiary member's (and any 
predecessor's) allocable share of items of deduction and loss of all 
lower-tier subsidiary members, that were taken into account in computing 
the adjustment under Sec. 1.1502-32 to the bases of shares of stock of 
the subsidiary member (and any predecessor) held by members of the group 
immediately before the deconsolidation, other than shares that have 
bases in excess of value immediately before the deconsolidation.
    (3) Exceptions to application of redetermination rules. (i) 
Paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall not apply to a transfer of 
subsidiary member stock if--
    (A) During the taxable year of such transfer, in one or more fully 
taxable transactions, the members of the group dispose of all of the 
shares of the subsidiary member stock that they own immediately before 
the transfer, other than the shares the transfer of which would 
otherwise trigger the application of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, 
to a person or persons that are not members of the group;
    (B) During the taxable year of such transfer, the members of the 
group are allowed a worthless stock loss under section 165(g) (taking 
into account the provisions of Sec. 1.1502-80(c)) with respect to all 
of the shares of subsidiary member stock that they own immediately 
before the transfer, other than the shares the transfer of which would 
otherwise trigger the application of paragraph (b)(1) of this section; 
or
    (C) Such transfer is to a member of the group and section 332 
(provided the stock is transferred to an 80-percent distributee), 
section 351, section 354, or section 361 applies to such transfer.
    (ii) Paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall not apply to a 
deconsolidation of a subsidiary member if--

[[Page 410]]

    (A) During the taxable year of such deconsolidation, in one or more 
fully taxable transactions, the members of the group dispose of all of 
the shares of the subsidiary member stock that they own immediately 
before the deconsolidation to a person or persons that are not members 
of the group;
    (B) Such deconsolidation results from a fully taxable disposition, 
to a person or persons that are not members of the group, of some of the 
shares of the subsidiary member, and, during the taxable year of such 
deconsolidation, the members of the group are allowed a worthless stock 
loss under section 165(g) with respect to all of the shares of the 
subsidiary member stock that they own immediately after the 
deconsolidation;
    (C) The members of the group are allowed a worthless stock loss 
under section 165(g) with respect to all of the shares of the subsidiary 
member stock that they own immediately before the deconsolidation;
    (D) The deconsolidation of the subsidiary member results from the 
deconsolidation of a higher-tier subsidiary member and, immediately 
after the deconsolidation of the subsidiary member, none of the stock of 
the subsidiary member is owned by a group member; or
    (E) The deconsolidation of the subsidiary member results from a 
termination of the group.
    (4) Special rule for lower-tier subsidiaries. If, immediately after 
a transfer of subsidiary member stock or a deconsolidation of a 
subsidiary member, a lower-tier subsidiary member some of the stock of 
which is owned by the subsidiary member is a member of the group, then, 
for purposes of applying paragraph (b) of this section, the subsidiary 
member shall be treated as having transferred its stock of the lower-
tier subsidiary member. This principle shall apply to stock of 
subsidiary members that are owned by such lower-tier subsidiary member.
    (5) Stock basis adjustments for higher-tier stock. The basis 
adjustments required under this paragraph (b) result in basis 
adjustments to higher-tier member stock. The adjustments are applied in 
the order of the tiers, from the lowest to highest. For example, if a 
common parent owns stock of a subsidiary member that owns stock of a 
lower-tier subsidiary member and the subsidiary member recognizes a loss 
on the disposition of a portion of its shares of the lower-tier 
subsidiary member stock, the common parent must adjust its basis in its 
subsidiary member stock under the principles of Sec. 1.1502-32 to 
reflect the adjustments that the subsidiary member must make to its 
basis in its stock of the lower-tier subsidiary member.
    (6) Ordering rules. (i) The rules of this paragraph (b) apply after 
the rules of Sec. 1.1502-32 are applied.
    (ii) The rules of this paragraph (b) apply before the rules of Sec. 
1.337(d)-2T and paragraphs (c) and (f) of this section are applied.
    (iii) Paragraph (b) of this section (and any resulting basis 
adjustments to higher-tier member stock made pursuant to paragraph 
(b)(5) of this section) applies to redetermine the basis of stock of a 
lower-tier subsidiary member before paragraph (b) of this section 
applies to a higher-tier member of such lower-tier subsidiary member.
    (c) Loss suspension--(1) General rule. Any loss recognized by a 
member of a consolidated group with respect to the disposition of a 
share of subsidiary member stock shall be suspended to the extent of the 
duplicated loss with respect to such share of stock if, immediately 
after the disposition, the subsidiary is a member of the consolidated 
group of which it was a member immediately prior to the disposition (or 
any successor group).
    (2) Special rule for lower-tier subsidiaries. This paragraph (c)(2) 
applies if neither paragraph (c)(1) nor (f) of this section applies to a 
member's disposition of a share of stock of a subsidiary member (the 
departing member), a loss is recognized on the disposition of such 
share, and the departing member owns stock of one or more other 
subsidiary members (a remaining member) that is a member of such group 
immediately after the disposition. In that case, such loss shall be 
suspended to the extent the duplicated loss with respect to the 
departing member stock disposed of is attributable to the remaining 
member or members.

[[Page 411]]

    (3) Treatment of suspended loss. For purposes of the rules of Sec. 
1.1502-32, any loss suspended pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of 
this section is treated as a noncapital, nondeductible expense of the 
member that disposes of subsidiary member stock, incurred during the 
taxable year that includes the date of the disposition of stock to which 
paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section applies. See Sec. 1.1502-
32T(b)(3)(iii)(C). Consequently, the basis of a higher-tier member's 
stock of the member that disposes of subsidiary member stock is reduced 
by the suspended loss in the year it is suspended.
    (4) Reduction of suspended loss--(i) General rule. The amount of any 
loss suspended pursuant to paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section 
shall be reduced, but not below zero, by the subsidiary member's (and 
any successor's) items of deduction and loss, and the subsidiary 
member's (and any successor's) allocable share of items of deduction and 
loss of all lower-tier subsidiary members, that are allocable to the 
period beginning on the date of the disposition that gave rise to the 
suspended loss and ending on the day before the first date on which the 
subsidiary member (or any successor) is not a member of the group of 
which it was a member immediately prior to the disposition (or any 
successor group), and that are taken into account in determining 
consolidated taxable income (or loss) of such group for any taxable year 
that includes any date on or after the date of the disposition and 
before the first date on which the subsidiary member (or any successor) 
is not a member of such group; provided, however, that such reduction 
shall not exceed the excess of the amount of such items over the amount 
of such items that are taken into account in determining the basis 
adjustments made under Sec. 1.1502-32 to stock of the subsidiary member 
(or any successor) owned by members of the group. The preceding sentence 
shall not apply to items of deduction and loss to the extent that the 
group can establish that all or a portion of such items was not 
reflected in the computation of the duplicated loss with respect to the 
subsidiary member on the date of the disposition of stock that gave rise 
to the suspended loss.
    (ii) Operating rules--(A) Year in which deduction or loss is taken 
into account. For purposes of paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, a 
subsidiary member's (or any successor's) deductions and losses are 
treated as taken into account when and to the extent they are absorbed 
by the subsidiary member (or any successor) or any other member. To the 
extent that the subsidiary member's (or any successor's) deduction or 
loss is absorbed in the year it arises or is carried forward and 
absorbed in a subsequent year (e.g., under section 172, 465, or 1212), 
the deduction is treated as taken into account in the year in which it 
is absorbed. To the extent that a subsidiary member's (or any 
successor's) deduction or loss is carried back and absorbed in a prior 
year (whether consolidated or separate), the deduction or loss is 
treated as taken into account in the year in which it arises and not in 
the year in which it is absorbed.
    (B) Determination of items that are allocable to the post-
disposition, pre-deconsolidation period. For purposes of paragraph 
(c)(4)(i) of this section, the determination of whether a subsidiary 
member's (or any successor's) items of deduction and loss and allocable 
share of items of deduction and loss of all lower-tier subsidiary 
members are allocable to the period beginning on the date of the 
disposition of subsidiary stock that gave rise to the suspended loss and 
ending on the day before the first date on which the subsidiary member 
(or any successor) is not a member of the consolidated group of which it 
was a member immediately prior to the disposition (or any successor 
group) is determined pursuant to the rules of Sec. 1.1502-76(b)(2), 
without regard to Sec. 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii)(D), as if the subsidiary 
member ceased to be a member of the group at the end of the day before 
the disposition and filed separate returns for the period beginning on 
the date of the disposition and ending on the day before the first date 
on which it is not a member of such group.
    (5) Allowable loss--(i) General rule. To the extent not reduced 
under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, any loss

[[Page 412]]

suspended pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section shall 
be allowed, to the extent otherwise allowable under applicable 
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and regulations thereunder, on a 
return filed by the group of which the subsidiary was a member on the 
date of the disposition of subsidiary stock that gave rise to the 
suspended loss (or any successor group) for the taxable year that 
includes the day before the first date on which the subsidiary (and any 
successor) is not a member of such group or the date the group is 
allowed a worthless stock loss under section 165(g) (taking into account 
the provisions of Sec. 1.1502-80(c)) with respect to all of the 
subsidiary member stock owned by members.
    (ii) No tiering up of certain adjustments. No adjustments shall be 
made to a member's basis of stock of a subsidiary member (or any 
successor) for a suspended loss that is taken into account under 
paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section. See Sec. 1.1502-32T(a)(2).
    (iii) Statement of allowed loss. Paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section 
applies only if the separate statement required under this paragraph 
(c)(5)(iii) is filed with, or as part of, the taxpayer's return for the 
year in which the loss is allowable. The statement must be entitled 
``ALLOWED LOSS UNDER Sec. 1.1502-35T(c)(5)'' and must contain the name 
and employer identification number of the subsidiary the stock of which 
gave rise to the loss.
    (6) Special rule for dispositions of certain carryover basis assets. 
If--
    (i) A member of a group recognizes a loss on the disposition of an 
asset other than stock of a subsidiary member;
    (ii) Such member's basis in the asset disposed of was determined, 
directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by reference to the basis 
of stock of a subsidiary member and, at the time of the determination of 
the member's basis in the asset disposed of, there was a duplicated loss 
with respect to such stock of the subsidiary member; and
    (iii) Immediately after the disposition, the subsidiary member is a 
member of such group, then such loss shall be suspended pursuant to the 
principles of paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section to the extent 
of the duplicated loss with respect to such stock at the time of the 
determination of basis of the asset disposed of. Principles similar to 
those set forth in paragraphs (c)(3), (c)(4), and (c)(5) of this section 
shall apply to a loss suspended pursuant to this paragraph (c)(6).
    (7) Coordination with loss deferral, loss disallowance, and other 
rules--(i) In general. Loss recognized on the disposition of subsidiary 
member stock or another asset is subject to redetermination, deferral, 
or disallowance under other applicable provisions of the Internal 
Revenue Code and regulations thereunder, including sections 267(f) and 
482. Paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)(6) of this section do not apply 
to a loss that is disallowed under any other provision. If loss is 
deferred under any other provision, paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2), and 
(c)(6) of this section apply when the loss would otherwise be taken into 
account under such other provision. However, if an overriding event 
described in paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this section occurs before the 
deferred loss is taken into account, paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2), and 
(c)(6) of this section apply to the loss immediately before the event 
occurs, even though the loss may not be taken into account until a later 
time.
    (ii) Overriding events. For purposes of paragraph (c)(7)(i) of this 
section, the following are overriding events--
    (A) The stock ceases to be owned by a member of the consolidated 
group;
    (B) The stock is canceled or redeemed (regardless of whether it is 
retired or held as treasury stock); or
    (C) The stock is treated as disposed of under Sec. 1.1502-
19(c)(1)(ii)(B) or (c)(1)(iii).
    (8) Application. This paragraph (c) shall not be applied in a manner 
that permanently disallows a deduction for an economic loss, provided 
that such deduction is otherwise allowable. If the application of any 
provision of this paragraph (c) results in such a disallowance, proper 
adjustment may be made to prevent such a disallowance. Whether a 
provision of this paragraph (c) has resulted in such a disallowance is 
determined on the date on which the subsidiary (or any successor) the 
disposition of the stock of which gave rise to a suspended stock loss is 
not a member of the group or the date the group

[[Page 413]]

is allowed a worthless stock loss under section 165(g) (taking into 
account the provisions of Sec. 1.1502-80(c)) with respect to all of 
such subsidiary member stock owned by members. Proper adjustment in such 
cases shall be made by restoring the suspended stock loss immediately 
before the subsidiary ceases to be a member of the group or the group is 
allowed a worthless stock loss under section 165(g) (taking into account 
the provisions of Sec. 1.1502-80(c)) with respect to all of such 
subsidiary member stock owned by members, to the extent that its 
reduction pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of this section had the result of 
permanently disallowing a deduction for an economic loss.
    (9) Ordering rule. The rules of this paragraph (c) apply after the 
rules of paragraph (b) of this section and Sec. 1.337(d)-2T are 
applied.
    (d) Definitions--(1) Disposition. Disposition means any event in 
which gain or loss is recognized, in whole or in part.
    (2) Deconsolidation. Deconsolidation means any event that causes a 
subsidiary member to no longer be a member of the consolidated group.
    (3) Value. Value means fair market value.
    (4) Duplicated loss--(i) In general. Duplicated loss is determined 
immediately after a disposition and equals the excess, if any, of--
    (A) The sum of--
    (1) The aggregate adjusted basis of the subsidiary member's assets 
other than any stock that subsidiary member owns in another subsidiary 
member; and
    (2) Any losses attributable to the subsidiary member and carried to 
the subsidiary member's first taxable year following the disposition; 
and
    (3) Any deductions of the subsidiary member that have been 
recognized but are deferred under a provision of the Internal Revenue 
Code (such as deductions deferred under section 469); over
    (B) The sum of--
    (1) The value of the subsidiary member's stock; and
    (2) Any liabilities of the subsidiary member that have been taken 
account for tax purposes.
    (ii) Special rules. (A) The amounts determined under paragraph 
(d)(4)(i) (other than amounts described in paragraph (d)(4)(i)(B)(1)) of 
this section with respect to a subsidiary member include its allocable 
share of corresponding amounts with respect to all lower-tier subsidiary 
members. If 80 percent or more in value of the stock of a subsidiary 
member is acquired by purchase in a single transaction (or in a series 
of related transactions during any 12-month period), the value of the 
subsidiary member's stock may not exceed the purchase price of the stock 
divided by the percentage of the stock (by value) so purchased. For this 
purpose, stock is acquired by purchase if the transferee is not related 
to the transferor within the meaning of sections 267(b) and 707(b)(1), 
using the language ``'10 percent''' instead of ``'50 percent''' each 
place that it appears, and the transferee's basis in the stock is 
determined wholly by reference to the consideration paid for such stock.
    (B) The amounts determined under paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section 
are not applied more than once to suspend a loss under this section.
    (5) Predecessor and Successor. A predecessor is a transferor of 
assets to a transferee (the successor) in a transaction--
    (i) To which section 381(a) applies;
    (ii) In which substantially all of the assets of the transferor are 
transferred to members in a complete liquidation;
    (iii) In which the successor's basis in assets is determined 
(directly or indirectly, in whole or in part) by reference to the 
transferor's basis in such assets, but the transferee is a successor 
only with respect to the assets the basis of which is so determined; or
    (iv) Which is an intercompany transaction, but only with respect to 
assets that are being accounted for by the transferor in a prior 
intercompany transaction.
    (6) Successor group. A surviving group is treated as a successor 
group of a consolidated group (the terminating group) that ceases to 
exist as a result of--
    (i) The acquisition by a member of another consolidated group of 
either the assets of the common parent of the terminating group in a 
reorganization described in section 381(a)(2), or the stock of the 
common parent of the terminating group; or

[[Page 414]]

    (ii) The application of the principles of Sec. 1.1502-75(d)(2) or 
(3).
    (7) Preferred stock, common stock. Preferred stock and common stock 
shall have the meanings set forth in Sec. 1.1502-32(d)(2) and (3), 
respectively.
    (8) Higher-tier. A subsidiary member is higher-tier with respect to 
a member if or to the extent investment basis adjustments under Sec. 
1.1502-32 with respect to the stock of the latter member would affect 
investment basis adjustments with respect to the stock of the former 
member.
    (9) Lower-tier. A subsidiary member is lower-tier with respect to a 
member if or to the extent investment basis adjustments under Sec. 
1.1502-32 with respect to the stock of the former member would affect 
investment basis adjustments with respect to the stock of the latter 
member.
    (e) Examples. For purposes of the examples in this section, unless 
otherwise stated, all groups file consolidated returns on a calendar-
year basis, the facts set forth the only corporate activity, all 
transactions are between unrelated persons, and tax liabilities are 
disregarded. The principles of paragraphs (a) through (d) of this 
section are illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. Nondeconsolidating sale of preferred stock of lower-tier 
subsidiary member. (i) Facts. P owns 100 percent of the common stock of 
each of S1 and S2. S1 and S2 each have only one class of stock 
outstanding. P's basis in the stock of S1 is $100 and the value of such 
stock is $130. P's basis in the stock of S2 is $120 and the value of 
such stock is $90. P, S1, and S2 are all members of the P group. S1 and 
S2 form S3. In Year 1, in transfers to which section 351 applies, S1 
contributes $100 to S3 in exchange for all of the common stock of S3 and 
S2 contributes an asset with a basis of $50 and a value of $20 to S3 in 
exchange for all of the preferred stock of S3. S3 becomes a member of 
the P group. In Year 3, in a transaction that is not part of the plan 
that includes the contributions to S3, S2 sells the preferred stock of 
S3 for $20. Immediately after the sale, S3 is a member of the P group.
    (ii) Application of basis redetermination rule. Because S2's basis 
in the preferred stock of S3 exceeds its value immediately prior to the 
sale and S3 is a member of the P group immediately after the sale, all 
of the P group members' bases in the stock of S3 is redetermined 
pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Of the group members' 
total basis of $150 in the S3 stock, $20 is allocated to the preferred 
stock, the fair market value of the preferred stock on the date of the 
sale, and $130 is allocated to the common stock. S2's sale of the 
preferred stock results in the recognition of $0 of gain/loss. Pursuant 
to paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the redetermination of S1's and 
S2's bases in the stock of S3 results in adjustments to P's basis in the 
stock of S1 and S2. In particular, P's basis in the stock of S1 is 
increased by $30 to $130 and its basis in the stock of S2 is decreased 
by $30 to $90.

    Example 2. Deconsolidating sale of common stock. (i) Facts. In Year 
1, in a transfer to which section 351 applies, P contributes Asset A 
with a basis of $900 and a value of $200 to S in exchange for one share 
of S common stock (CS1). In Years 2 and 3, in successive but unrelated 
transfers to which section 351 applies, P transfers $200 to S in 
exchange for one share of S common stock (CS2), Asset B with a basis of 
$300 and a value of $200 in exchange for one share of S common stock 
(CS3), and Asset C with a basis of $1000 and a value of $200 in exchange 
for one share of S common stock (CS4). In Year 4, S sells Asset A for 
$200, recognizing $700 of loss that is used to offset income of P 
recognized during Year 4. As a result of the sale of Asset A, the basis 
of each of P's four shares of S common stock is reduced by $175. 
Therefore, the basis of CS1 is $725. The basis of CS2 is $25. The basis 
of CS3 is $125, and the basis of CS4 is $825. In Year 5 in a transaction 
that is not part of a plan that includes the Year 1 contribution, P 
sells CS4 for $200. Immediately after the sale of CS4, S is not a member 
of the P group.
    (ii) Application of basis redetermination rule. Because P's basis in 
each of CS1 and CS4 exceeds its value immediately prior to the 
deconsolidation of S, P's basis in its shares of S common stock is 
redetermined pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the reallocable basis amount is 
$350 (the lesser of $1150, the gross loss inherent in the stock of S 
owned by P immediately before the sale, and $350, the aggregate amount 
of S's items of deduction and loss that were previously taken into 
account in the computation of the adjustment to the basis of the stock 
of S that P did not hold at a loss immediately before the 
deconsolidation). Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, 
first, P's basis in CS1 is reduced from $725 to $600 and P's basis in 
CS4 is reduced from $825 to $600. Then, the reallocable basis amount 
increases P's basis in CS2 from $25 to $250 and P's basis in CS3 from 
$125 to $250. P recognizes $400 of loss on the sale of CS4. The loss 
suspension rule does not apply because S is no longer a member of the P 
group. Thus, the loss is allowable at that time.

[[Page 415]]

    Example 3. Nondeconsolidating sale of common stock. (i) Facts. In 
Year 1, P forms S with a contribution of $80 in exchange for 80 shares 
of the common stock of S, which at that time represents all of the 
outstanding stock of S. S becomes a member of the P group. In Year 2, P 
contributes Asset A with a basis of $50 and a value of $20 in exchange 
for 20 shares of the common stock of S in a transfer to which section 
351 applies. In Year 3, in a transaction that is not part of the plan 
that includes the Year 2 contribution, P sells the 20 shares of the 
common stock of S that it acquired in Year 2 for $20. Immediately after 
the Year 3 stock sale, S is a member of the P group. At the time of the 
Year 3 stock sale, S has $80 and Asset A. In Year 4, S sells Asset A , 
the basis and value of which have not changed since its contribution to 
S. On the sale of Asset A for $20, S recognizes a $30 loss. The P group 
cannot establish that all or a portion of the $30 loss was not reflected 
in the calculation of the duplicated loss of S on the date of the Year 3 
stock sale. The $30 loss is used on the P group return to offset income 
of P. In Year 5, P sells its remaining S common stock for $80.
    (ii) Application of basis redetermination and loss suspension rules. 
Because P's basis in the common stock sold exceeds its value immediately 
prior to the sale and S is a member of the P group immediately after the 
sale, P's basis in all of the stock of S is redetermined pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Of P's total basis of $130 in the S 
common stock, a proportionate amount is allocated to each of the 100 
shares of S common stock. Accordingly, $26 is allocated to the common 
stock of S that is sold and $104 is allocated to the common stock of S 
that is retained. On P's sale of the 20 shares of the common stock of S 
for $20, P recognizes a loss of $6. Because the sale of the 20 shares of 
common stock of S does not result in the deconsolidation of S, under 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section, that loss is suspended to the extent 
of the duplicated loss with respect to the shares sold. The duplicated 
loss with respect to the shares sold is $6. Therefore, the entire $6 
loss is suspended.
    (iii) Effect of subsequent asset sale on stock basis. Of the $30 
loss recognized on the sale of Asset A, $24 is taken into account in 
determining the basis adjustments made under Sec. 1.1502-32 to the 
stock of S owned by P. Accordingly, P's basis in its S stock is reduced 
by $24 from $104 to $80.
    (iv) Effect of subsequent asset sale on suspended loss. Because P 
cannot establish that all or a portion of the loss recognized on the 
sale of Asset A was not reflected in the calculation of the duplicated 
loss of S on the date of the Year 3 stock sale and such loss is 
allocable to the period beginning on the date of the Year 3 disposition 
of the S stock and ending on the day before the first date on which S is 
not a member of the P group and is taken into account in determining 
consolidated taxable income (or loss) of the P group for a taxable year 
that includes a date on or after the date of the Year 3 disposition and 
before the first date on which S is not a member of the P group, such 
asset loss reduces the suspended loss pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of 
this section. The amount of such reduction, however, cannot exceed $6, 
the excess of the amount of such loss, $30, over the amount of such loss 
that is taken into account in determining the basis adjustment made to 
the stock of S owned by P, $24. Therefore, the suspended loss is reduced 
to zero.
    (v) Effect of subsequent stock sale. P recognizes $0 gain/loss on 
the Year 5 sale of its remaining S common stock. No amount of suspended 
loss remains to be allowed under paragraph (c)(5) of this section.
    Example 4. Nondeconsolidating sale of common stock of lower-tier 
subsidiary. (i) Facts. In Year 1, P forms S1 with a contribution of $200 
in exchange for all of the common stock of S1, which represents all of 
the outstanding stock of S1. In the same year, S1 forms S2 with a 
contribution of $80 in exchange for 80 shares of the common stock of S2, 
which at that time represents all of the outstanding stock of S2. S1 and 
S2 become members of the P group. In the same year, S2 purchases Asset A 
for $80. In Year 2, S1 contributes Asset B with a basis of $50 and a 
value of $20 in exchange for 20 shares of the common stock of S2 in a 
transfer to which section 351 applies. In Year 3, S1 sells the 20 shares 
of the common stock of S2 that it acquired in Year 2 for $20. 
Immediately after the Year 3 stock sale, S2 is a member of the P group. 
At the time of the Year 3 stock sale, the bases and values of Asset A 
and Asset B are unchanged. In Year 4, S2 sells Asset B for $45, 
recognizing a $5 loss. The P group cannot establish that all or a 
portion of the $5 loss was not reflected in the calculation of the 
duplicated loss of S2 on the date of the Year 3 stock sale. The $5 loss 
is used on the P group return to offset income of P. In Year 5, S1 sells 
its remaining S2 common stock for $100.
    (ii) Application of basis redetermination and loss suspension rules. 
Because S1's basis in the S2 common stock sold exceeds its value 
immediately prior to the sale and S2 is a member of the P group 
immediately after the sale, S1's basis in all of the stock of S2 is 
redetermined pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Of S1's total 
basis of $130 in the S2 common stock, a proportionate amount is 
allocated to each of the 100 shares of S2 common stock. Accordingly, a 
total of $26 is allocated to the common stock of S2 that is sold and 
$104 is allocated to the common stock of S2 that is retained. On S1's 
sale of the 20 shares of the common stock of S2 for $20, S1 recognizes a 
loss of $6. Because the sale of the 20 shares of common stock of S2 does 
not

[[Page 416]]

result in the deconsolidation of S2, under paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section, that loss is suspended to the extent of the duplicated loss 
with respect to the shares sold. The duplicated loss with respect to the 
shares sold is $6. Therefore, the entire $6 loss is suspended. Pursuant 
to paragraph (c)(3) of this section and Sec. 1.1502-32T(b)(3)(iii)(C), 
the suspended loss is treated as a noncapital, nondeductible expense 
incurred by S1 during the tax year that includes the date of the 
disposition of stock to which paragraph (c)(1) of this section applies. 
Accordingly, P's basis in its S1 stock is reduced from $200 to $194.
    (iii) Effect of subsequent asset sale on stock basis. Of the $5 loss 
recognized on the sale of Asset B, $4 is taken into account in 
determining the basis adjustments made under Sec. 1.1502-32 to the 
stock of S2 owned by S1. Accordingly, S1's basis in its S2 stock is 
reduced by $4 from $104 to $100 and P's basis in its S1 stock is reduced 
by $4 from $194 to $190.
    (iv) Effect of subsequent asset sale on suspended loss. Because P 
cannot establish that all or a portion of the loss recognized on the 
sale of Asset B was not reflected in the calculation of the duplicated 
loss of S2 on the date of the Year 3 stock sale and such loss is 
allocable to the period beginning on the date of the Year 3 disposition 
of the S2 stock and ending on the day before the first date on which S2 
is not a member of the P group and is taken into account in determining 
consolidated taxable income (or loss) of the P group for a taxable year 
that includes a date on or after the date of the Year 3 disposition and 
before the first date on which S2 is not a member of the P group, such 
asset loss reduces the suspended loss pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of 
this section. The amount of such reduction, however, cannot exceed $1, 
the excess of the amount of such loss, $5, over the amount of such loss 
that is taken into account in determining the basis adjustment made to 
the stock of S2 owned by members of the P group, $4. Therefore, the 
suspended loss is reduced to $5.
    (v) Effect of subsequent stock sale. In Year 5, when S1 sells its 
remaining S2 stock for $100, it recognizes $0 gain/loss. Pursuant to 
paragraph (c)(5) of this section, the remaining $5 of the suspended loss 
is allowed on the P group's return for Year 5 when S1 sells its 
remaining S2 stock.
    Example 5. Deconsolidating sale of subsidiary member owning stock of 
another subsidiary member that remains in group. (i) Facts. In Year 1, P 
forms S1 with a contribution of Asset A with a basis of $50 and a value 
of $20 in exchange for 100 shares of common stock of S1 in a transfer to 
which section 351 applies. Also in Year 1, P and S1 form S2. P 
contributes $80 to S2 in exchange for 80 shares of common stock of S2. 
S1 contributes Asset A to S2 in exchange for 20 shares of common stock 
of S2 in a transfer to which section 351 applies. In Year 3, in a 
transaction that is not part of a plan that includes the Year 1 
contributions, P sells its 100 shares of S1 common stock for $20. 
Immediately after the Year 3 stock sale, S2 is a member of the P group. 
At the time of the Year 3 stock sale, S1 owns 20 shares of common stock 
of S2, and S2 has $80 and Asset A. In Year 4, S2 sells Asset A, the 
basis and value of which have not changed since its contribution to S2. 
On the sale of Asset A for $20, S2 recognizes a $30 loss. That $30 loss 
is used on the P group return to offset income of P. In Year 5, P sells 
its S2 common stock for $80.
    (ii) Application of basis redetermination and loss suspension rules. 
Pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section, because immediately before 
P's transfer of S1 stock S1 owns stock of S2 (another subsidiary member 
of the same group) that has a basis that exceeds its value, paragraph 
(b) of this section applies as if S1 had transferred its stock of S2. 
Because S2 is a member of the group immediately after the transfer of 
the S1 stock, the group member's basis in the S2 stock is redetermined 
pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section immediately prior to the 
sale of the S1 stock. Of the group members' total basis of $130 in the 
S2 stock, $26 is allocated to S1's 20 shares of S2 common stock and $104 
is allocated to P's 80 shares of S2 common stock. Pursuant to paragraph 
(b)(5) of this section, the redetermination of S1's basis in the stock 
of S2 results in an adjustment to P's basis in the stock of S1. In 
particular, P's basis in the stock of S1 is decreased by $24 to $26. On 
P's sale of its 100 shares of S1 common stock for $20, P recognizes a 
loss of $6. Because S1 is not a member of the P group immediately after 
P's sale of the S1 stock, paragraph (c)(1) of this section does not 
apply to suspend such loss. However, because P recognizes a loss with 
respect to the disposition of the S1 stock and S1 owns stock of S2 
(which is a member of the P group immediately after the disposition), 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section does apply to suspend up to $6 of that 
loss, an amount equal to the amount by which the duplicated loss with 
respect to the stock of S1 sold is attributable to S2's adjusted basis 
in its assets, loss carryforwards, and deferred deductions.
    (iii) Effect of subsequent asset sale on stock basis. Of the $30 
loss recognized on the sale of Asset A, $24 is taken into account in 
determining the basis adjustments made under Sec. 1.1502-32 to the 
stock of S2 owned by P. Accordingly, P's basis in its S2 stock is 
reduced by $24 from $104 to $80.
    (iv) Effect of subsequent asset sale on suspended loss. Because P 
cannot establish that all or a portion of the loss recognized on the 
sale of Asset A was not reflected in the calculation of the duplicated 
loss of S2 on the date of the Year 3 stock sale and such loss is 
allocable to the period beginning on the date

[[Page 417]]

of the Year 3 deemed disposition of the S2 stock and ending on the day 
before the first date on which S2 is not a member of the P group and is 
taken into account in determining consolidated taxable income (or loss) 
of the P group for a taxable year that includes a date on or after the 
date of the Year 3 deemed disposition and before the first date on which 
S2 is not a member of the P group, such asset loss reduces the suspended 
loss pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of this section. The amount of such 
reduction, however, cannot exceed $6, the excess of the amount of such 
loss, $30, over the amount of such loss that is taken into account in 
determining the basis adjustment made to the stock of S2 owned by P, 
$24. Therefore, the suspended loss is reduced to zero.
    (v) Effect of subsequent stock sale. P recognizes $0 gain/loss on 
the Year 5 sale of its remaining S2 common stock. No amount of suspended 
loss remains to be allowed under paragraph (c)(5) of this section.
    Example 6. Loss recognized on asset with basis determined by 
reference to stock basis of subsidiary member. (i) Facts. In Year 1, P 
forms S with a contribution of $80 in exchange for 80 shares of common 
stock of S which at that time represents all of the outstanding stock of 
S. S becomes a member of the P group. In Year 2, P contributes Asset A 
with a basis of $50 and a value of $20 in exchange for 20 shares of 
common stock of S in a transfer to which section 351 applies. In Year 3, 
in a transaction that is not part of a plan that includes the Year 1 and 
Year 2 contributions, P contributes the 20 shares of S common stock it 
acquired in Year 2 to PS, a partnership, in exchange for a 20 percent 
capital and profits interest in a transaction described in section 721. 
Immediately after the contribution to PS, S is a member of the P group. 
In Year 4, P sells its interest in PS for $20, recognizing a $30 loss.
    (ii) Application of basis redetermination rule upon nonrecognition 
transfer. Because P's basis in the S common stock contributed to PS 
exceeds its value immediately prior to the transfer and S is a member of 
the P group immediately after the transfer, P's basis in all of the S 
stock is redetermined pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Of 
P's total basis of $130 in the common stock of S, a proportionate amount 
is allocated to each share of S common stock. Accordingly, $26 is 
allocated to the S common stock that is contributed to PS and, under 
section 722, P's basis in its interest in PS is $26.
    (iii) Application of loss suspension rule on disposition of asset 
with basis determined by reference to stock basis of subsidiary member. 
P recognizes a $6 loss on its disposition of its interest in PS. Because 
P's basis in its interest in PS was determined by reference to the basis 
of S stock and at the time of the determination of P's basis in its 
interest in PS such S stock had a duplicated loss of $6, and, 
immediately after the disposition, S is a member of the P group, such 
loss is suspended to the extent of such duplicated loss. Principles 
similar to those of paragraphs (c)(3), (c)(4), and (c)(5) of this 
section shall apply to such suspended loss.

    (f) Worthlessness not followed by separate return years--(1) General 
rule. Notwithstanding any other provision in the regulations under 
section 1502, if a member of a group (the claiming group) treats stock 
of a subsidiary as worthless under section 165 (taking into account the 
provisions of Sec. 1.1502-80(c)) and, on the day following the last day 
of the claiming group's taxable year in which the worthless stock 
deduction is claimed, the subsidiary (or its successor, determined 
without regard to paragraphs (d)(5)(iii) and (iv) of this section) is a 
member of a group that includes any corporation that, during that 
taxable year, was a member of the claiming group (other than a lower-
tier subsidiary of the subsidiary) or is a successor (determined without 
regard to paragraphs (d)(5)(iii) and (iv) of this section) of such a 
member, then all losses treated as attributable to the subsidiary under 
the principles of Sec. 1.1502-21T(b)(2)(iv) shall be treated as expired 
as of the day following the last day of the claiming group's taxable 
year in which the worthless stock deduction is claimed. In addition, 
notwithstanding any other provision in the regulations under section 
1502, if a member recognizes a loss with respect to subsidiary stock and 
on the following day the subsidiary is not a member of the group and 
does not have a separate return year, then all losses treated as 
attributable to the subsidiary under the principles of Sec. 1.1502-
21T(b)(2)(iv) shall be treated as expired as of the day following the 
last day of the group's taxable year in which the stock loss is claimed. 
For purposes of this paragraph (f), the determination of the losses 
attributable to the subsidiary shall be made after computing the taxable 
income of the group for the taxable year in which the group treats the 
stock of the subsidiary as worthless or the subsidiary liquidates and 
after computing the taxable income for any taxable year to which such 
losses may be carried back. The loss treated as expired under this 
paragraph (f)

[[Page 418]]

shall not be treated as a noncapital, nondeductible expense under Sec. 
1.1502-32(b)(2)(iii). This paragraph (f) applies to worthlessness 
determinations and liquidations that occur after March 18, 2004 and 
before March 12, 2006. However, the group may apply this paragraph (f) 
to worthlessness determinations and liquidations that occur on or after 
March 7, 2002 and before March 18, 2004; otherwise, paragraph (f) of 
Sec. 1.1502-35T as contained in 26 CFR part 1 edition revised as of 
April 1, 2003, shall apply to such determinations of worthlessness and 
liquidations.
    (2) Election in the case of determinations of worthlessness and 
dispositions not followed by a separate return that occurred prior to 
March 14, 2003. If stock of a subsidiary member is treated as worthless 
under section 165 (taking into account the provisions of Sec. 1.1502-
80(c)) on or after March 7, 2002, and prior to March 14, 2003, or if a 
member of a group disposes of subsidiary member stock on or after March 
7, 2002, and prior to March 14, 2003 and on the following day the 
subsidiary is not a member of the group and does not have a separate 
return year, then, notwithstanding paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the 
common parent may make an irrevocable election to reattribute to itself 
all or any portion of the losses treated as attributable to such 
subsidiary member under the principles of Sec. 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv). The 
election shall be in the form of a statement filed with or as part of 
the group's return for the taxable year in which the worthlessness is 
established or the disposition occurs. The statement shall be entitled 
``Election under Section 1.1502-35T(f)(2)'' and must state that the 
common parent is making an irrevocable election under this paragraph 
(f)(2) to reattribute to itself the losses of the subsidiary member the 
stock of which is worthless or disposed of. In addition, it must 
identify the subsidiary to which the election relates and the portion of 
losses subject to the election. If the election provided in this 
paragraph is made, the common parent shall be treated as succeeding to 
the reattributed losses as if the losses were succeeded to in a 
transaction described in section 381(a). For purposes of applying the 
provisions of Sec. 1.1502-32, the reattributed losses shall be treated 
as absorbed by the group immediately prior to the allowance of any loss 
or inclusion of any income or gain with respect to the determination of 
worthlessness or the disposition. In the case of an election to 
reattribute less than all of the losses otherwise treated as 
attributable to such subsidiary member under the principles of Sec. 
1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv), paragraph (f)(1) of this section shall apply to 
that portion of the losses for which an election under this paragraph 
(f)(2) is not made.
    (g) Anti-avoidance rules--(1) Transfer of share without a loss in 
avoidance. If a share of subsidiary member stock has a basis that does 
not exceed its value and the share is transferred with a view to 
avoiding application of the rules of paragraph (b) of this section prior 
to the transfer of a share of subsidiary member stock that has a basis 
that does exceed its value or a deconsolidation of a subsidiary member, 
the rules of paragraph (b) of this section shall apply immediately prior 
to the transfer of stock that has a basis that does not exceed its 
value.
    (2) Transfers of loss property in avoidance. If a member of a 
consolidated group contributes an asset with a basis that exceeds its 
value to a partnership in a transaction described in section 721 or a 
corporation that is not a member of such group in a transfer described 
in section 351, such partnership or corporation contributes such asset 
to a subsidiary member in a transfer described in section 351, and such 
contributions are undertaken with a view to avoiding the rules of 
paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, adjustments must be made to carry 
out the purposes of this section.
    (3) Anti-loss reimportation--(i) Application. This paragraph (g)(3) 
applies if--
    (A) A member of a group recognizes and is allowed a loss on the 
disposition of a share of stock of a subsidiary member with respect to 
which there is a duplicated loss; and
    (B) Within the 10-year period beginning on the date the subsidiary 
member (or any successor) ceases to be a member of such group--
    (1) The subsidiary member (or any successor) again becomes a member 
of such group (or any successor group)

[[Page 419]]

when the subsidiary member (or any successor) owns any asset that has a 
basis in excess of value at such time and that was owned by the 
subsidiary member (or any successor) on the date of a disposition of 
stock of such subsidiary member (or any successor) and that had a basis 
in excess of value on such date;
    (2) The subsidiary member (or any successor) again becomes a member 
of such group (or any successor group) when the subsidiary member (or 
any successor) owns any asset that has a basis in excess of value at 
such time and that has a basis that reflects, directly or indirectly, in 
whole or in part, the basis of any asset that was owned by the 
subsidiary member on the date of a disposition of stock of such 
subsidiary member (or any successor) and that had a basis in excess of 
value on such date;
    (3) In a transaction described in section 381 or section 351, any 
member of such group (or any successor group) acquires any asset of the 
subsidiary member (or any successor) that was owned by the subsidiary 
member (or any successor) on the date of a disposition of stock of such 
subsidiary member (or any successor) and that had a basis in excess of 
its value on such date, or any asset that has a basis that reflects, 
directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, the basis of any asset that 
was owned by the subsidiary member (or any successor) on the date of a 
disposition of stock of such subsidiary member (or any successor) and 
that had a basis in excess of its value on such date, and, immediately 
after the acquisition of such asset, such asset has a basis in excess of 
its value;
    (4) The subsidiary member (or any successor) again becomes a member 
of such group (or any successor group) when the subsidiary member (or 
any successor) has a liability (within the meaning of section 358(h)(3)) 
that it had on the date of a disposition of stock of such subsidiary 
member (or any successor) and such liability will give rise to a 
deduction;
    (5) In a transaction described in section 381 or section 351, any 
member of such group (or any successor group) assumes a liability 
(within the meaning of section 358(h)(3)) that was a liability of the 
subsidiary member (or any successor) on the date of a disposition of 
stock of such subsidiary member (or any successor);
    (6) The subsidiary member (or any successor) again becomes a member 
of such group (or any successor group) when the subsidiary member (or 
any successor) has any losses or deferred deductions that were losses or 
deferred deductions of the subsidiary member (or any successor) on the 
date of a disposition of stock of such subsidiary member (or any 
successor);
    (7) The subsidiary member (or any successor) again becomes a member 
of such group (or any successor group) when the subsidiary member (or 
any successor) has any losses or deferred deductions that are 
attributable to any asset that was owned by the subsidiary member (or 
any successor) on the date of a disposition of stock of such subsidiary 
member (or any successor) and that had a basis in excess of value on 
such date;
    (8) The subsidiary member (or any successor) again becomes a member 
of such group (or any successor group) when the subsidiary member (or 
any successor) has any losses or deferred deductions that are 
attributable to any asset that had a basis that reflected, directly or 
indirectly, in whole or in part, the basis of any asset that was owned 
by the subsidiary member (or any successor) on the date of a disposition 
of stock of such subsidiary member (or any successor) and that had a 
basis in excess of value on such date;
    (9) The subsidiary member (or any successor) again becomes a member 
of such group (or any successor group) when the subsidiary member (or 
any successor) has any losses or deferred deductions that are 
attributable to a liability (within the meaning of section 358(h)(3)) 
that it had on the date of a disposition of stock of such subsidiary 
member (or any successor);
    (10) Any member of such group (or any successor group) succeeds to 
any losses or deferred deductions of the subsidiary member (or any 
successor) that were losses or deferred deductions of the subsidiary 
member (or any successor) on the date of a disposition of stock of such 
subsidiary member (or any successor), that are attributable to

[[Page 420]]

any asset that was owned by the subsidiary member (or any successor) on 
the date of a disposition of stock of such subsidiary member (or any 
successor) and that had a basis in excess of value on such date, that 
are attributable to any asset that had a basis that reflected, directly 
or indirectly, in whole or in part, the basis of any asset that was 
owned by the subsidiary member (or any successor) on the date of a 
disposition of stock of such subsidiary member (or any successor) and 
that had a basis in excess of value on such date, or that are 
attributable to a liability (within the meaning of section 358(h)(3)) of 
the subsidiary member (or any successor) on the date of a disposition of 
stock of such subsidiary member (or any successor); or
    (11) Any losses or deferred deductions of the subsidiary member (or 
any successor) that were losses or deferred deductions of the subsidiary 
member (or any successor) on the date of a disposition of stock of such 
subsidiary member (or any successor), that are attributable to any asset 
that was owned by the subsidiary member (or any successor) on the date 
of a disposition of stock of such subsidiary member (or any successor) 
and that had a basis in excess of value on such date, that are 
attributable to any asset that had a basis that reflected, directly or 
indirectly, in whole or in part, the basis of any asset that was owned 
by the subsidiary member (or any successor) on the date of a disposition 
of stock of such subsidiary member (or any successor) and that had a 
basis in excess of value on such date, or that are attributable to a 
liability (within the meaning of section 358(h)(3)) of the subsidiary 
member (or any successor) on the date of a disposition of stock of such 
subsidiary member (or any successor) are carried back to a pre-
disposition taxable year of the subsidiary member.
    (ii) Operating rules. (A) For purposes of paragraph (g)(3)(i)(B) of 
this section, assets shall include stock and securities and the 
subsidiary member (or any successor) shall be treated as having its 
allocable share of losses and deferred deductions of all lower-tier 
subsidiary members and as owning its allocable share of each asset of 
all lower-tier subsidiary members.
    (B) For purposes of paragraphs (g)(3)(i)(B)(6), (7), (8), and (9) of 
this section, unless the group can establish otherwise, if the 
subsidiary member (or any successor) again becomes a member of such 
group (or any successor group) at a time when the subsidiary member (or 
any successor) has any losses or deferred deductions, such losses and 
deferred deductions shall be treated as losses or deferred deductions 
that were losses or deferred deductions of the subsidiary member (or any 
successor) on the date of a disposition of stock of such subsidiary 
member (or any successor), losses or deferred deductions that are 
attributable to assets that were owned by the subsidiary member (or any 
successor) on the date of a disposition of stock of such subsidiary 
member (or any successor) and that had bases in excess of value on such 
date, losses or deferred deductions that are attributable to assets that 
had bases that reflected, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, 
the bases of assets that were owned by the subsidiary member (or any 
successor) on the date of a disposition of stock of such subsidiary 
member (or any successor) and that had bases in excess of value on such 
date, or losses or deferred deductions attributable to a liability 
(within the meaning of section 358(h)(3)) of the subsidiary member (or 
any successor) on the date of a disposition of stock of such subsidiary 
member (or any successor).
    (C) For purposes of paragraph (g)(3)(i)(B)(10) of this section, 
unless the group can establish otherwise, if a member of such group (or 
any successor group) succeeds to any losses or deferred deductions of 
the subsidiary member (or any successor), such losses and deferred 
deductions shall be treated as losses or deferred deductions that were 
losses or deferred deductions of the subsidiary member (or any 
successor) on the date of a disposition of stock of such subsidiary 
member (or any successor), losses or deferred deductions that are 
attributable to assets that were owned by the subsidiary member (or any 
successor) on the date of a disposition of stock of such subsidiary 
member (or any successor) and

[[Page 421]]

that had bases in excess of value on such date, losses or deferred 
deductions that are attributable to assets that had bases that 
reflected, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, the bases of 
assets that were owned by the subsidiary member (or any successor) on 
the date of a disposition of stock of such subsidiary member (or any 
successor) and that had bases in excess of value on such date, or losses 
or deferred deductions attributable to a liability (within the meaning 
of section 358(h)(3)) of the subsidiary member (or any successor) on the 
date of a disposition of stock of such subsidiary member (or any 
successor).
    (D) For purposes of paragraph (g)(3)(i)(B)(11) of this section, 
unless the group can establish otherwise, if any losses or deferred 
deductions of the subsidiary member (or any successor) are carried back 
to a pre-disposition taxable year of the subsidiary member, such losses 
and deferred deductions shall be treated as losses or deferred 
deductions that were losses or deferred deductions of the subsidiary 
member (or any successor) on the date of a disposition of stock of such 
subsidiary member (or any successor), losses or deferred deductions that 
are attributable to assets that were owned by the subsidiary member (or 
any successor) on the date of a disposition of stock of such subsidiary 
member (or any successor) and that had a basis in excess of value on 
such date, losses or deferred deductions that are attributable to assets 
that had bases that reflected, directly or indirectly, in whole or in 
part, the bases of assets that were owned by the subsidiary member (or 
any successor) on the date of a disposition of stock of such subsidiary 
member (or any successor) and that had a basis in excess of value on 
such date, or losses or deferred deductions that are attributable to a 
liability (within the meaning of section 358(h)(3)) of the subsidiary 
member (or any successor) on the date of a disposition of stock of such 
subsidiary member (or any successor).
    (iii) Loss disallowance. If this paragraph (g)(3) applies, then, to 
the extent that the aggregate amount of loss recognized by members of 
the group (and any successor group) on dispositions of the subsidiary 
member stock was attributable to a duplicated loss of such subsidiary 
member that was allowed, such group (or any successor group) will be 
denied the use of--
    (A) Any loss recognized that is attributable to, directly or 
indirectly, an asset that was owned by the subsidiary member (or any 
successor) on the date of a disposition of stock of such subsidiary 
member (or any successor) and that had a basis in excess of value on 
such date, to the extent of the lesser of the loss inherent in such 
asset on the date of a disposition of the stock of the subsidiary member 
(or any successor) and the loss inherent in such asset on the date of 
the event described in paragraph (g)(3)(i)(B) of this section that gives 
rise to the application of this paragraph (g)(3);
    (B) Any loss recognized that is attributable to, directly or 
indirectly, an asset that has a basis that reflects, directly or 
indirectly, in whole or in part, the basis of any asset that was owned 
by the subsidiary member (or any successor) on the date of a disposition 
of stock of such subsidiary member (or any successor) and that had a 
basis in excess of its value on such date, to the extent of the lesser 
of the loss inherent in the asset that was owned by the subsidiary 
member (or any successor) on the date of a disposition of stock of such 
subsidiary member (or any successor) the basis of which is reflected, 
directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, in the basis of such asset 
on the date of the disposition and the loss inherent in such asset on 
the date of the event described in paragraph (g)(3)(i)(B) of this 
section that gives rise to the application of this paragraph (g)(3);
    (C) Any loss or deduction that is attributable to a liability 
described in paragraph (g)(3)(i)(B)(4) or (5) of this section; and
    (D) Any loss or deduction described in paragraph (g)(3)(i)(B)(6), 
(7), (8), (9), (10), or (11) of this section, provided that a loss or 
deferred deduction described in paragraph (g)(3)(i)(B)(11) of this 
section shall be allowed to be carried forward to a post-disposition 
taxable year of the subsidiary member.
    (iv) Treatment of disallowed loss. For purposes of Sec. 1.1502-
32(b)(3)(iii), any loss

[[Page 422]]

or deduction the use of which is disallowed pursuant to paragraph 
(g)(3)(iii) of this section (other than a loss or deduction described in 
paragraph (g)(3)(i)(B)(11) of this section), and with respect to which 
no waiver described in Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(4) is filed, is treated as a 
noncapital, nondeductible expense incurred during the taxable year that 
such loss would otherwise be absorbed.
    (4) Avoidance of recognition of gain. (i) If a transaction is 
structured with a view to, and has the effect of, deferring or avoiding 
the recognition of gain on a disposition of stock by invoking the 
application of paragraph (b)(1) of this section to redetermine the basis 
of stock of a subsidiary member, and the stock loss that gives rise to 
the application of paragraph (b)(1) of this section is not significant, 
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section shall not apply.
    (ii) If a transaction is structured with a view to, and has the 
effect of, deferring or avoiding the recognition of gain on a 
disposition of stock by invoking the application of paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section to redetermine the basis of stock of a subsidiary member, 
and the duplicated loss of the subsidiary member that is reflected in 
stock of the subsidiary member owned by members of the group immediately 
before the deconsolidation is not significant, paragraphs (b) and (c) of 
this section shall not apply.
    (5) Examples. The principles of this paragraph (g) are illustrated 
by the following examples:

    Example 1. Transfers of property in avoidance of basis 
redetermination rule. (i) Facts. In Year 1, P forms S with a 
contribution of $100 in exchange for 100 shares of common stock of S 
which at that time represents all of the outstanding stock of S. S 
becomes a member of the P group. In Year 2, P contributes 20 shares of 
common stock of S to PS, a partnership, in exchange for a 20 percent 
capital and profits interest in a transaction described in section 721. 
In Year 3, P contributes Asset A with a basis of $50 and a value of $20 
to PS in exchange for an additional capital and profits interest in PS 
in a transaction described in section 721. Also in Year 3, PS 
contributes Asset A to S and P contributes an additional $80 to S in 
transfers to which section 351 applies. In Year 4, S sells Asset A for 
$20, recognizing a loss of $30. The P group uses that loss to offset 
income of P. Also in Year 4, P sells its entire interest in PS for $40, 
recognizing a loss of $30.
    (ii) Analysis. Pursuant to paragraph (g)(2) of this section, if P's 
contributions of S stock and Asset A to PS were undertaken with a view 
to avoiding the application of the basis redetermination or the loss 
suspension rule, adjustments must be made such that the group does not 
obtain more than one tax benefit from the $30 loss inherent in Asset A.
    Example 2. Transfers effecting a reimportation of loss. (i) Facts. 
In Year 1, P forms S with a contribution of Asset A with a value of $100 
and a basis of $120, Asset B with a value of $50 and a basis of $70, 
Asset C with a value of $90 and a basis of $100 in exchange for all of 
the common stock of S and S becomes a member of the P group. In Year 2, 
in a transaction that is not part of a plan that includes the 
contribution, P sells the stock of S for $240, recognizing a loss of 
$50. At such time, the bases and values of Assets A, B, and C have not 
changed since their contribution to S. In Year 3, S sells Asset A, 
recognizing a $20 loss. In Year 3, S merges into M in a reorganization 
described in section 368(a)(1)(A). In Year 8, P purchases all of the 
stock of M for $300. At that time, M has a $10 net operating loss. In 
addition, M owns Asset D, which was acquired in an exchange described in 
section 1031 in connection with the surrender of Asset B. Asset C has a 
value of $80 and a basis of $100. Asset D has a value of $60 and a basis 
of $70. In Year 9, P has operating income of $100 and M recognizes $20 
of loss on the sale of Asset C. In Year 10, P has operating income of 
$50 and M recognizes $50 of loss on the sale of Asset D.
    (ii) Analysis. P's $50 loss on the sale of S stock is entirely 
attributable to duplicated loss. Therefore, pursuant to paragraph (g)(3) 
of this section, assuming the P group cannot establish otherwise, M's 
$10 net operating loss is treated as attributable to assets that were 
owned by S on the date of the disposition and that had bases in excess 
of value on such date. Without regard to any other limitations on the 
group's use of M's net operating loss, the P group cannot use M's $10 
net operating loss pursuant to paragraph (g)(3)(iii)(D) of this section. 
Pursuant to paragraph (g)(3)(iv) of this section and Sec. 1.1502-
32T(b)(3)(iii)(D), such loss is treated as a noncapital, nondeductible 
expense of M incurred during the taxable year that includes the day 
after the reorganization. In addition, the P group is denied the use of 
$10 of the loss recognized on the sale of Asset C. Finally, the P group 
is denied the use of $10 of the loss recognized on the sale of Asset D. 
Pursuant to paragraph (g)(3)(iv) of this section and Sec. 1.1502-
32T(b)(3)(iii)(D), each such disallowed loss is treated as a noncapital, 
nondeductible expense of M incurred during the taxable year that 
includes the date of

[[Page 423]]

the disposition of the asset with respect to which such loss was 
recognized.
    Example 3. Transfers to avoid recognition of gain. (i) Facts. P owns 
all of the stock of S1 and S2. The S2 stock has a basis of $400 and a 
value of $500. S1 owns 50% of the stock of the S3 common stock with a 
basis of $150. S2 owns the remaining 50% of the S3 common stock with a 
basis of $100 and a value of $200 and one share of S3 preferred stock 
with a basis of $10 and a value of $9. P intends to sell all of its S2 
stock to an unrelated buyer. P, therefore, engages in the following 
steps to dispose of S2 without recognizing a substantial portion of the 
built-in gain in S2. First, P causes a recapitalization of S3 in which 
S2's S3 common stock is exchanged for new S3 preferred shares. P then 
sells all of its S2 stock. Immediately after the sale of the S2 stock, 
S3 is a member of the P group.
    (ii) Analysis. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section, because 
S2 owns stock of S3 (another subsidiary member of the same group) and, 
immediately after the sale of the S2 stock, S3 is a member of the group, 
then for purposes of applying paragraph (b) of this section, S2 is 
deemed to have transferred its S3 stock. Because S3 is a member of the 
group immediately after the transfer of the S2 stock and the S3 stock 
deemed transferred has a basis in excess of value, the group member's 
basis in the S3 stock is redetermined pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section immediately prior to the sale of the S2 stock. Pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the total basis of S3 stock held by 
members of the P group is allocated first to the S3 preferred shares, up 
to their value of $209, and then to the remaining shares of S3 common 
held by S1. S2's aggregate basis in the S3 preferred stock is increased 
from $110 to $209. This increase tiers up and increases P's basis in the 
S2 stock from $400 to $499. Accordingly, P will recognize only $1 of 
gain on the sale of its S2 stock. However, because the recapitalization 
of S3 was structured with a view to, and has the effect of, avoiding the 
recognition of gain on a disposition of stock by invoking the 
application of paragraph (b) of this section, paragraph (g)(4)(i) of 
this section applies. Accordingly, paragraph (b) of this section does 
not apply upon P's disposition of the S2 stock and P recognizes $100 of 
gain on the disposition of the S2 stock.

    (h) Application of other anti-abuse rules. The rules of this section 
do not preclude the application of anti-abuse rules under other 
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and regulations thereunder.
    (i) [Reserved]
    (j) Effective date. This section, except for paragraph (g)(3) of 
this section, applies with respect to stock transfers, deconsolidations 
of subsidiary members, determinations of worthlessness, and stock 
dispositions on or after March 7, 2002, and no later than March 11, 
2006, but only if such events occur during a taxable year the original 
return for which is due (without regard to extensions) after March 14, 
2003. Paragraph (g)(3) of this section applies to events described in 
paragraph (g)(3)(iii) of this section occurring on or after October 18, 
2002, and no later than March 11, 2006, but only if such events occur 
during a taxable year the original return for which is due (without 
regard to extensions) after March 14, 2003.

                       Special Taxes and Taxpayers


<R05>
Sec. 1.1502-42  Mutual savings banks, etc.

    (a) In general. This section applies to mutual savings banks and 
other institutions described in section 593(a).
    (b) Total deposits. In computing for purposes of section 
593(b)(1)(B)(ii) total deposits or withdrawable accounts at the close of 
the taxable year, the total deposits or withdrawable accounts of other 
members shall be excluded.
    (c) Taxable income; taxable years for which the due date (without 
extensions) for filing returns is before March 15, 1983. For taxable 
years for which the due date (without extensions) for filing returns is 
before March 15, 1983, a member's taxable income for purposes of section 
593(b)(2) is determined under Sec. 1.1502-27(b) (computed without 
regard to any deduction under section 593(b)(2)). In addition, for 
taxable years beginning after July 11, 1969, taxable income as computed 
under the preceding sentence is subject to the adjustments provided in 
section 593(b)(2)(E). See Sec. 1.593-6A(b)(5).
    (d) Taxable income; taxable years for which the due date (without 
extensions) for filing returns is after March 14, 1983--(1) In general. 
For a taxable year for which the due date (without extensions) for 
filing returns is after March 14, 1983, a thrift's taxable income for

[[Page 424]]

purposes of section 593(b)(2) is its tentative taxable income (as 
defined in paragraph (e)(1) of this section).
    (2) Definitions. For purposes of this section:
    (i) A thrift is a member described in section 593(a).
    (ii) A nonthrift is a member that is not a thrift.
    (e) Tentative taxable income (or loss)--(1) Thrift. For purposes of 
this section, a thrift's tentative taxable income (or loss) is its 
separate taxable income (determined under Sec. 1.1502-12 without 
paragraph (q) thereof and without any deduction under section 593(b)), 
subject to the following adjustments in the following order:
    (i) The adjustments described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section;
    (ii) The adjustments described in section 593(b)(2)(E) for those 
thrifts with separate taxable income greater than zero (determined after 
the adjustments under paragraph (e)(3) of this section); and
    (iii) The adjustments described in paragraph (f) of this section.
    (2) Nonthrift. For purposes of this section, a nonthrift's tentative 
taxable income (or loss) is its separate taxable income (determined 
under Sec. 1.1502-12), adjusted for the portion of the consolidated net 
operating loss deduction attributable to the member, the portion of the 
consolidated net capital loss carryover or carryback attributable to the 
member, and further adjusted as described in paragraph (e)(3) of this 
section.
    (3) Adjustments for all members. For each member, the following 
adjustments taken into account in the computation of consolidated 
taxable income are included in determining its tentative taxable income 
(or loss) in order to adjust separate taxable income of the member to 
take into account certain consolidated items:
    (i) The portions of the consolidated charitable contributions 
deduction and the consolidated dividends received deduction attributable 
to the member.
    (ii) The member's capital gain net income, determined without any 
net capital loss carryover or carryback attributable to the member.
    (iii) The member's net capital loss and section 1231 net loss, 
reduced by the portion of the consolidated net capital loss attributable 
to the member.
    (f) Adjustments for thrifts--(1) Reductions. A thrift's separate 
taxable income (as adjusted under paragraph (e)(3) of this section) is 
reduced (but not below zero) by losses of thrifts and to the extent 
attributable to functionally related activities, losses of a nonthrift. 
Certain operating rules for determining the amount of the reductions are 
provided in paragraph (f)(4) of this section. The reductions are made in 
the following amounts in the following order:
    (i) The thrift's allocable share (as determined under paragraph 
(h)(2) of this section) of another thrift's tentative taxable loss. That 
tentative taxable loss is determined by including a deduction under 
section 593(b) (other than paragraph (2) thereof) for the year in which 
the loss arises.
    (ii) The thrift's allocable share (as determined under paragraph 
(h)(3) of this section) of the portion of the consolidated net operating 
loss deduction attributable to it or another thrift. That consolidated 
net operating loss deduction is determined by including a deduction 
under section 593(b) (other than paragraph (2) thereof) for the year in 
which the loss arose. The portion of a consolidated net operating loss 
deduction attributable to another thrift is computed by excluding losses 
arising in taxable years for which the due date (without extensions) for 
filing returns is before March 15, 1983.
    (iii) The thrift's allocable share (as determined under paragraph 
(h)(4) of this section) of the loss attributable to functionally related 
activities of a nonthrift (as determined under paragraph (g) of this 
section). For a rule netting that share against certain income 
attributable to functionally related activities of that nonthrift, see 
paragraph (f)(4)(iv) of this section.
    (iv) The thrift's allocable share (as determined under paragraph 
(h)(3) of this section) of the portion of the consolidated net operating 
loss deduction attributable to functionally related activities of a 
nonthrift (as determined under paragraph (h)(5) of this section). That 
consolidated net operating loss deduction is determined by excluding 
losses arising in taxable years for

[[Page 425]]

which the due date (without extensions) for filing returns is before 
March 15, 1983. For a rule netting that share against certain income 
attributable to functionally related activities of that nonthrift, see 
paragraph (f)(4)(iv) of this section.
    (2) Increases. (i) A thrift's separate taxable income (as adjusted 
under paragraphs (e)(3) and (f)(1) of this section) is increased in a 
subsequent consolidated return year to restore reductions made in a 
prior consolidated return year to a thrift's separate taxable income by 
reason of losses of a nonthrift. This increase is the amount of the 
thrift's allocable share (as determined under paragraph (h)(6) of this 
section) of the income attributable to functionally related activities 
of a nonthrift in a consolidated return year and is made only in that 
year. This increase is made only if both the thrift and the nonthrift 
were members of the group in the consolidated return years in which both 
the reduction and increase are made.
    (ii) This subdivision (ii) limits the increases to a thrift's 
separate taxable income to assure that income of a particular nonthrift 
is used to restore reductions of a thrift only to the extent that such 
nonthrift's losses reduced the thrift's income. Therefore, as of the end 
of a consolidated return year, the cumulative increases to a thrift's 
tentative taxable income (by reason of income attributable to 
functionally related activities of a nonthrift) may not exceed the 
cumulative reductions to the thrift's separate taxable income made (by 
reason of the nonthrift's functionally related activities) under 
paragraph (f)(1) (iii) and (iv) of this section in the current and all 
prior consolidated return years during which both the thrift institution 
and the nonthrift institution were members of the group.
    (iii) For a netting rule, see paragraph (f)(4)(iv) of this section.
    (3) Special Rule. (i) If a carryback to a thrift's separate taxable 
income diminishes the reduction to a thrift's separate taxable income 
for a prior consolidated return year otherwise required by paragraph 
(f)(1) (iii) or (iv) of this section, then any increases to a thrift's 
separate taxable income under paragraph (f)(2) of this section for an 
intervening consolidated return year must be recomputed to take into 
account the effect of such carryback. Thus, if a net operating loss 
attributable to a thrift is carried back and completely offsets the 
thrift's separate taxable income (before the reductions under paragraph 
(f)(1) (iii) or (iv) or this section), any increase to the thrift's 
separate taxable income under paragraph (f)(2) of this section 
(attributable to a reduction in the year to which the loss is carried) 
for an intervening consolidated return year will be eliminated. The 
recomputation required by this subparagraph (3) must be reflected on an 
amended return for the intervening consolidated return year for which 
the increase was previously reported. See example (2) in paragraph (j) 
of this section.
    (ii) If a deficiency for an intervening consolidated return year 
results from the application of paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section with 
respect to an item to which section 6501(h) applies, the deficiency may 
be assessed at any time within the period described in section 6501(h).
    (iii) For purposes of chapter 67 of the Code (relating to interest), 
the last date prescribed for payment of any tax owed as a result of the 
application of paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section is deemed to be the 
last day of the taxable year for which the item carried back arose.
    (4) Operating rules. For purposes of paragraphs (d) through (j) of 
this section:
    (i) The portion of a consolidated net operating loss deduction 
attributable to a member is determined as follows:
    (A) First, determine under Sec. Sec. 1.1502-21(b) (or Sec. 
1.1502-79A(a)(3), as appropriate) the portion of each consolidated net 
operating loss attributable to the member for the particular year in 
which the loss arose.
    (B) Second, apply the anti-double-counting rule in paragraph 
(h)(3)(iii) of this section so as not to take the same loss into account 
twice.
    (C) Finally, apply the loss absorption limit in paragraph 
(f)(4)(iii) of this section to the total amount of the consolidated net 
operating loss deduction from a particular loss year.

[[Page 426]]

    (ii) Capital loss carryovers and carrybacks shall be taken into 
account in a manner consistent with the principles of paragraphs (d) 
through (j) of this section.
    (iii) This subdivision (iii) prescribes a loss absorption limit. The 
total amount of the consolidated net operating loss deduction from a 
given year (loss year) taken into account as reductions under paragraph 
(f)(1) of this section for another year (absorption year) shall not 
exceed the amount of the consolidated net operating loss deduction 
attributable to the loss year absorbed in computing consolidated taxable 
income for the absorption year. For this purpose, consolidated taxable 
income for the absorption year shall include a deduction under section 
593(b) (other than paragraph (2) thereof) for each thrift member.
    (iv) This subdivision (iv) prescribes a rule for netting in certain 
cases income attributable to functionally related activities of a 
nonthrift in a consolidated return year (``income year'') against losses 
attributable to functionally related activities of that nonthrift which 
arise in a consolidated return year (``loss year''). That nonthrift's 
income is netted against the portion of that nonthrift's loss which 
would otherwise be applied in a consolidated return year (``reduction 
year'') under paragraph (f)(1) (iii) or (iv) of this section to reduce a 
thrift's tentative taxable income, but:
    (A) Only if the income year is not later than the loss year and the 
reduction year, and
    (B) Only to the extent the income had not previously been taken into 
account under paragraph (f)(2) of this section or this subdivision (iv) 
as of the close of the later of the loss year and the reduction year.
    (g) Income (or loss) attributable to functionally related activities 
of a nonthrift--(1) In general. For purposes of this section, the income 
(or loss) attributable to functionally related activities of a nonthrift 
is the income (or loss) of the nonthrift:
    (i) Attributable to the provision of assets or the rendition of 
services to a thrift (such as the leasing of office space or providing 
computer or financial services), or
    (ii) Derived from the assets described in section 7701(a)(19)(C) 
(iii) through (x), but only if such assets comprise 5 percent or more of 
the gross assets of the nonthrift.
    (2) Amount of income (or loss).The amount of income (or loss) from 
such activities is the excess of (i) gross income from such activities 
over (ii) the deductions of the nonthrift allocable and apportionable to 
that gross income under the principles of Sec. 1.861-8. The loss 
attributable to functionally related activities of a nonthrift is the 
excess (if any) of such deductions over such gross income. That loss, 
however, may not exceed the amount of the tentative taxable loss of that 
nonthrift (determined by excluding losses arising in taxable years for 
which the due date (without extensions) for filing returns is before 
March 15, 1983).
    (h) Allocation of income and losses--(1) In general. Paragraphs 
(h)(2) through (5) of this section provides rules for allocating 
different losses among thrifts that have tentative taxable income 
greater than zero. Generally, these allocations are made in the order 
listed in paragraph (f)(1) of this section and are based upon the 
relative tentative taxable income of the thrifts to which the particular 
loss is allocated. For purposes of each allocation under a subdivision 
of such paragraph (f)(1), the tentative taxable income of the thrifts 
used in making this allocation is reduced by the thrift's allocable 
share of losses allocated to the thrift under a prior subdivision of 
such paragraph (f)(1). Accordingly, for purposes of this paragraph (h), 
tentative taxable income is determined without regard to paragraph (f) 
of this section, except as otherwise provided. Paragraph (h)(6) of this 
section provides rules for allocating income attributable to 
functionally related activities of a nonthrift based upon the relative 
reductions to thrift income made on account of that nonthrift.
    (2) Allocation of tentative taxable loss of other thrifts. For 
purposes of paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section, a thrift's allocable 
share of another thrift's tentative taxable loss is the loss multiplied 
by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the tentative taxable 
income (if greater than zero) of the

[[Page 427]]

thrift, and the denominator is the aggregate of such tentative taxable 
income of each thrift.
    (3) Allocation of portions of a consolidated net operating loss 
deduction. (i) For purposes of paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section, a 
first thrift's allocable share of the portion of the consolidated net 
operating loss deduction attributable to another thrift is determined 
under paragraph (h)(2) of this section as if that portion were a 
tentative taxable loss of that other thrift and by computing tentative 
taxable income under such paragraph (h)(2) by taking into account 
paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section. A thrift's allocable share of the 
portion of the consolidated net operating loss deduction attributable to 
that thrift is equal to that entire portion.
    (ii) For purposes of paragraph (f)(1)(iv) of this section, a 
thrift's allocable share of the portion of a consolidated net operating 
loss deduction attributable to functionally related activities of a 
nonthrift (determined under paragraph (h)(5) of this section) is 
determined under paragraph (h)(4) of this section as if that portion 
were a loss attributable to functionally related activities of the 
nonthrift and by computing tentative taxable income under such paragraph 
(h)(4) by taking into account paragraph (f)(1) (i), (ii), and (iii) of 
this section.
    (iii) This subdivision (iii) prevents the ``double-counting'' of 
losses. The reduction to the tentative taxable income of a thrift is 
diminished to the extent the loss that gave rise to the reduction has 
previously been taken into account in reducing a thrift's tentative 
taxable income. Thus, any loss taken into account as a reduction to a 
thrift's separate taxable income under any subdivision of paragraph 
(f)(1) of this section shall be reduced (but not below zero) to the 
extent taken into account:
    (A) In a prior consolidated return year under any subdivision of 
such paragraph (f)(1) or
    (B) In the current consolidated return year under a previous 
subdivision of such paragraph (f)(1).
    (4) Allocation of loss attributable to functionally related 
activities of a nonthrift. For purposes of paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this 
section, a thrift's allocable share of a loss attributable to 
functionally related activities of a nonthrift is determined by 
multiplying the loss by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the 
tentative taxable income (if greater than zero) of the thrift (taking 
into account paragraph (f)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section) and the 
denominator is the aggregate of such tentative taxable income (so 
determined) of each thrift.
    (5) Portion of the consolidated net operating loss deduction 
attributable to functionally related activities of a particular 
nonthrift. The portion of the consolidated net operating loss deduction 
attributable to functionally related activities of a particular 
nonthrift is the lesser of the following two amounts:
    (i) The portion of the consolidated net operating loss deduction 
attributable to that nonthrift.
    (ii) The aggregate of the losses attributable to functionally 
related activities of that nonthrift for the taxable years in which the 
consolidated net operating loss deduction arose.
    (6) Allocation of income attributable to functionally related 
activities of a nonthrift. For purposes of paragraph (f)(2) of this 
section, a thrift institution's allocable share of the income 
attributable to functionally related activities of a nonthrift is 
determined by multiplying that income by a fraction. The numerator of 
the fraction is the amount of the cumulative reductions referred to in 
paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section (minus the cumulative increases 
under paragraph (f)(2) of this section) made on account of that 
nonthrift for the thrift and the denominator is the sum of such 
cumulative reductions (minus such cumulative increases) made on account 
of that nonthrift for all thrifts.
    (7) Proper accounting The provisions of section 482 apply in 
determining a thrift institution's tentative taxable income, and in 
determining the gross income and deductions attributable to functionally 
related activities. For example, an expense such as the salary of an 
individual who performs services for both a thrift and a nonthrift must 
be allocated in a manner that fairly reflects the value of the services 
rendered to each.

    (i) [Reserved]
    (j) Examples. The provisions of this section may be illustrated by 
the following examples. In each example the letter ``T'' for a member 
denotes a thrift and the letters ``NT'' denote a nonthrift. Also, in 
each example, a thrift loss includes a bad debt deduction under section 
593(b) (other than paragraph (2) thereof) for such year and a thrift 
with income would have such a bad debt deduction of zero.

    Example (1). (a) In 1983, corporations T1, T2, NT1, and NT2 are 
formed. These corporations constitute an affiliated group that files a 
consolidated return on the basis of a calendar year. For 1983, 1984, and 
1985, the tentative taxable income (or loss) of each member (before the 
application of paragraph (f) of this section) is as follows:

    In 1983, NT1, in addition to its other business activities, acted as 
a collection agency for T1. Deductions attributable to those activities 
exceeded gross income attributable to those activities by $70. NT1's 
other activities generated a $10 gain. In 1984 and 1985, NT1 acted as a 
collection agency for T1 as its sole activity.
    (b) The tentative taxable incomes of T1 and T2 for 1983 (determined 
under paragraph (e) of this section) as of the close of that year are 
adjusted by paragraph (f) of this section as follows:

adjusted by paragraph (f) of this section as follows:

    (d) For 1985, the amount under paragraph (f) (2) of this section for 
both T1 and T2 is $15 (NT1's tentative taxable income from functionally 
related activities for 1985). For 1983 and 1984, T1's tentative taxable 
income was reduced by a total of $138 (i.e., $60 + $78) due to NT1`s 
losses from functionally related activities. For 1984, T2's tentative 
taxable income was reduced by $62 due to those losses. Accordingly, 
under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, T1's tentative taxable income 
for 1983 is increased by $10 (i.e., $15x$138/($138+$62)) and T2's 
tentative taxable income is increased by $5 (i.e., $15x$62/($138+$62)).
    Example (2). (a) In 1983, corporations T, NT1, and NT2 are formed. 
these corporations constitute an affiliated group. NT2 provides computer 
services to T as its sole activity. For the calendar years 1983, 1984, 
and 1985, the group files a consolidated return. The tentative taxable 
income of each member (before the application of paragraph (f) of this 
section) is as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                 1983     1984     1985
------------------------------------------------------------------------
T............................................     $100       $0   $(200)
NT1..........................................      200        0      100
NT2..........................................     (20)       20        0
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, T's tentative taxable 
income for 1983 (determined at the close of that year) is reduced to $80 
(i.e., $100 less NT2's $20 loss). For 1984, under paragraph (f)(2) of 
this section, T's tentative taxable income is increased by $20. For 
1985, the consolidated net operating loss of $100 (all of which is 
attributable to T) is carried back to 1983. That $100 carryback is not 
limited by paragraph (f)(4)(iii) of this section, since consolidated 
taxable income for 1983 available for absorption after a bad debt 
deduction of $0 under section 593(b) (other than paragraph (2) thereof) 
for that year is $280. Accordingly, under paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this 
section, T's tentative taxable income is reduced by the full $100, which 
is taken into account before the previous reduction of T's tentative 
taxable income under paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section. In addition, 
under paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section, the group must file an 
amended return for 1984 to eliminate the increase to T's bad debt 
deduction for 1984 by reason of the consolidated net operating loss 
carryback to 1983.
    Example (3). (a) T and NT are formed in 1983 and are the only 
members of an affiliated

[[Page 429]]

group filing a consolidated return on a calendar year basis. NT provided 
computer services to T as its sole activity. For 1983, 1984, and 1985, 
the tentative taxable income of T and NT (before the application of 
paragraph (f) of this section) is as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                 1983     1984     1985
------------------------------------------------------------------------
T............................................     $100       $0       $0
NT...........................................        0       40     (40)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) At the close of 1983, T's tentative taxable income is $100. For 
1985, however, the group has a consolidated net operating loss of $40, 
all of which is attributable to NT's functionally related activities and 
which is carried back to 1983. However, T's tentative taxable income for 
1983 is not reduced under paragraph (f)(1)(iv) of this section, since, 
under paragraph (f)(4)(iv) of this section, NT's 1984 income 
attributable to functionally related activities of $40 is netted against 
that $40 carryback.
    Example (4). (a) In 1983, corporations T1, T2, NT1, and NT2 are 
formed. For calendar years 1983, 1984, and 1985, the affiliated group 
consisting of T1, T2, NT1, and NT2 filed a consolidated return. NT1 
provided computer services to T1 as its sole activity. The tentative 
taxable income of each member (before the application of paragraph (f) 
of this section) is as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                 1983     1984     1985
------------------------------------------------------------------------
T1...........................................     (50)      100       30
T2...........................................     (50)     (80)     (25)
NT1..........................................     (50)     (40)     (99)
NT2..........................................      120       30      100
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) For 1983, the group has a consolidated net operating loss of 
$30, apportioned $10 each to T1, T2, and NT1 under Sec. 1.1502-
79A(a)(3). For 1984, the only thrift with tentative taxable income 
greater than zero (before applying paragraph (f) of this section) is T1. 
That tentative taxable income of $100 is first reduced to $20 by T2's 
$80 1984 loss under paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section. Next, T1's 
remaining tentative taxable income of $20 is reduced to $10 by the 
portions attributable to T1 and T2 of the 1983 consolidated net 
operating loss carryover to 1984 under paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this 
section. The sum of those portions is limited to $10 (i.e., $5 each) by 
paragraph (f)(4)(iii) of this section because 1984 consolidated taxable 
income available for absorption after a bad debt deduction under section 
593(b) (other than paragraph (2) thereof) for each thrift member for 
that year is $10. For that reason, paragraph (f)(4)(iii) of this section 
also prevents any further portion of that carryover from being taken 
into account in 1984 as a reduction under paragraph (f)(1) of this 
section. T1's remaining tentative taxable income of $10 is reduced to 
zero, under paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section, by NT1's 1984 
tentative taxable loss.
    (c) For 1985, the only thrift with tentative taxable income greater 
than zero (before applying paragraph (f) of this section) is T1. T1's 
tentative taxable income for 1985 of $30 is reduced to $5 by T2's 1985 
loss of $25 under paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section. Next, the 
portions attributable to T1 and T2 of the consolidated net operating 
loss carryover from 1983 to 1985 for purposes of paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of 
this section must be determined. That determination is made without 
applying the rules for loss absorption in computing consolidated taxable 
income under Sec. 1.1502-21A(b)(3). Those portions are instead 
determined in 3 steps under paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section. The 
first of those steps is to determine each of T1's and T2's attributable 
portions of the 1983 consolidated net operating loss which under Sec. 
1.1502-79A (a)(3) is $10 or $20 for both thrifts. The second of those 
steps is to apply the anti-double counting rule under paragraph 
(h)(3)(iii) of this section to reduce that $20 amount by the $10 total 
of the two $5 portions attributable to T1 and T2 of the consolidated net 
operating loss carryover from 1983 to 1984 taken into account as 
reductions to T1's tentative taxable income for 1984 under paragraph 
(f)(1)(ii) of this section. That leaves a $10 total amount available to 
be taken into account as reductions to T1's remaining tentative taxable 
income of $5 for 1985 under paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section. Under 
the third of those steps that $10 amount, however, is limited, under the 
loss absorption limit of paragraph (f)(4)(iii) of this section, to the 
$6 of the 1983 consolidated net operating loss carryover to 1985 which 
is absorbed in computing consolidated taxable income for 1985 since 1985 
consolidated taxable income available for absorption after a bad debt 
deduction under section 593(b) (other than paragraph (2) thereof) for 
that year is $6 (i.e., $30+$100-$99-$25). Because separate taxable 
income cannot be reduced below zero under paragraph (f)(1) of this 
section, T1's remaining tentative taxable income of $5 is thus reduced 
to zero by the portions attributable to T1 and T2, respectively, of the 
consolidated net operating loss carryover from 1983 to 1985 under 
paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section.

Sec. 1.1502-43  Consolidated accumulated earnings tax.

    (a) Group subject to tax--(1) General rule. For a group filing a 
consolidated return for the taxable year, the accumulated earnings tax 
under section 531 is imposed on consolidated accumulated taxable income 
(as defined in paragraph (b) of this section). This tax applies to any 
group that is formed or availed of to avoid or prevent the imposition of 
the individual income tax on the shareholders of either any of its 
members or any other corporation by permitting earnings and profits to 
accumulate instead of dividing or distributing them. Section 531 and 
this section do not apply to a group that is treated as a ``personal 
holding company'' under section 542(a)(1) as a result of the application 
of section 542(b)(1). Special rules are provided in this section for 
other groups which include one or more personal holding companies.
    (2) Evidence of purpose to avoid income tax. (i) Under section 
533(a), the fact that the group's earnings and profits are permitted to 
accumulate beyond the reasonable needs of its business is determinative 
of the purpose to avoid the income tax with respect to shareholders, 
unless the group by the preponderance of the evidence proves to the 
contrary.
    (ii) The fact that a group is a mere holding or investment group is 
prima facie evidence of the group's purpose to avoid the income tax with 
respect to the shareholders. The activities of a member which is a 
personal holding company are not taken into account in determining if 
the group is a mere holding or investment group.
    (3) Earnings and profits. For purposes of this paragraph (a) and 
paragraph (d) of this section, the following rules apply:
    (i) If no member of the group is a personal holding company, the 
group's earnings and profits are the aggregate of the earnings and 
profits (or deficit) of each corporation that is a member at the close 
of the taxable year, determined in accordance with Sec. 1.1502-33.
    (ii) Earnings and profits resulting from the application of Sec. 
1.1502-33(b) are not taken into account.
    (iii) Earnings and profits resulting from the disposition of a 
member's stock are determined without regard to the stock basis 
adjustments under Sec. Sec. 1.1502-32 and 1.1502-33(c)(1).
    (4) Reasonable needs of the business. The reasonable needs of the 
group's business include the reasonable needs of the business of any 
corporation (other than a personal holding company) that is a member at 
the close of the taxable year. Thus, the earnings and profits of one 
member may be accumulated with respect to the reasonable business needs 
of another member. If under Sec. 1.537-3(b) the business of a nonmember 
corporation is considered the business of a member, then the earnings 
and profits of any member may be accumulated with respect to such 
nonmember's reasonable business needs.
    (5) Burden of proof. The notification described in section 534(b) 
and the statement described in section 534(c) are made to or by the 
common parent corporation in accordance with Sec. 1.1502-77.
    (b) Consolidated accumulated taxable income--(1) In general. 
``Consolidated accumulated taxable income'' is the group's consolidated 
taxable income determined under Sec. 1.1502-11 adjusted in the manner 
provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, minus the sum of--
    (i) The consolidated dividends paid deduction determined under 
paragraph (c) of this section and
    (ii) The consolidated accumulated earnings credit determined under 
paragraph (d) of this section.
    (2) Adjustments to consolidated taxable income. For purposes of 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, consolidated taxable income is 
adjusted as follows:
    (i) Under section 535(b)(1), the deduction for taxes is the excess 
of--
    (A) The consolidated liability for tax determined without Sec. 
1.1502-2 (b) through (d) and without the foreign tax credit provided by 
section 33, over
    (B) The consolidated foreign tax credit determined pursuant to Sec. 
1.1502-4. Foreign taxes deductible under Sec. 1.535-2(a)(2) are also 
allowed as a deduction under section 535(b)(1).
    (ii) The consolidated charitable contributions deduction under Sec. 
1.1502-24

[[Page 431]]

does not apply. Under section 535(b)(2), there shall be allowed the 
aggregate charitable contributions of the members allowable under 
section 170, determined without section 170 (b)(2) and (d)(2).
    (iii) Under section 535(b)(3), the deductions provided in Sec. Sec. 
1.1502-26 and 1.1502-27 are not allowed.
    (iv) Under section 535(b)(4), the consolidated net operating loss 
deduction described in Sec. Sec. 1.1502-21(a) or 1.1502-21A(a), as 
appropriate is not allowed.
    (v) Under section 535(b)(5), there is allowed as a deduction the 
consolidated net capital loss, determined under Sec. Sec. 1.1502-22(a) 
or 1.1502-22A(a), as appropriate .
    (vi) Under section 535(b)(6), there is allowed as a deduction an 
amount equal to (A) the excess of the consolidated net long-term capital 
gain (determined under Sec. Sec. 1.1502-22(a) or 1.1502-41A, as 
appropriate over the consolidated net short-term capital loss 
(determined under Sec. Sec. 1.1502-22T(a) or 1.1502-41A, as 
appropriate), minus (B) the taxes attributable to this excess. This 
consolidated net short-term capital loss is determined without the 
consolidated net capital loss carryovers or carrybacks to the taxable 
year.
    (vii) Under section 535(b)(7), the consolidated net capital loss 
carryovers and carrybacks are not allowed. See Sec. Sec. 1.1502-22(b) 
or 1.1502-22A(b), as appropriate.
    (viii) Sections 1.1502-15A (Limitations on built-in deductions not 
subject to Sec. 1.1502-15) and 1.1502-15 do not apply.
    (3) Personal holding company a member. If a member is a personal 
holding company for the taxable year--
    (i) [Reserved]
    (ii) In applying paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, consolidated 
liability for tax (as determined under that paragraph (b)(2)(i)) is 
reduced by the portion thereof allocable to that member under section 
1552(a) (1), (2), (3), or (4) (or Sec. 1.1502-33(d)), whichever is 
applicable. The consolidated foreign tax credit is computed by excluding 
the taxable income and any foreign taxes paid or accrued by that member, 
and foreign taxes deductible under Sec. 1.535-2(a)(2) do not include 
foreign taxes attributable to that member.
    (c) Consolidated dividends paid deduction--(1) General rule. For 
purposes of this section, the consolidated dividends paid deduction is 
the aggregate of the members' deductions under section 561(a) (1) and 
(2). This deduction is determined by excluding deductions for dividends 
paid to other members.
    (2) Exception for certain personal holding companies. [Reserved]
    (3) Dividends paid defined. For purposes of this paragraph (c), 
``dividends paid'' and ``dividend (or portion thereof) paid'' include 
amounts treated as dividends paid during the taxable year under sections 
562(b)(1), 563, and 565 (relating respectively to liquidating 
distributions, dividends paid after year end, and consent dividends).
    (4) Examples. This paragraph (c) can be illustrated by the following 
examples:

    Example (1). Corporations P and S constitute an affiliated group 
which files a consolidated return on a calendar year basis for 1984 and 
1985. P owns all of S's stock and two individuals own all of P's stock. 
Neither member of the group is a personal holding company for 1984. 
Assume that on December 15, 1984, S pays a dividend (as defined in 
section 316 (a)) of $2,000 to P, and P pays a dividend (as so defined) 
of $3,000 on January 15, 1985, to its individual shareholders. All 
dividends are paid in cash and are pro rata with no preference as to any 
shares or class of stock. For purposes of this paragraph (c), the 
consolidated dividends paid deduction for 1984 is $3,000, i.e., the 
dividend paid on January 15, 1985, by P to its nonmember shareholders. 
See section 563 (a). The $2,000 dividend paid by S to P is not taken 
into account in computing the consolidated dividends paid deduction.

Sec. 1.1502-44  Percentage depletion for independent producers and 
royalty owners.

    (a) In general. The sum of the percentage depletion deductions for 
the taxable year for all oil or gas property owned by all members, plus 
any carryovers under section 613A(d)(1) or paragraph (d) of this section 
from a

[[Page 432]]

prior taxable year, may not exceed 65 percent of the group's adjusted 
consolidated taxable income (under paragraph (b) of this section) for 
the consolidated return year.
    (b) Adjusted consolidated taxable income. For purposes of this 
section, adjusted consolidated taxable income is an amount (not less 
than zero) equal to the group's consolidated taxable income determined 
without:
    (1) Any depletion with respect to an oil or gas property (other than 
a gas property with respect to which the depletion allowance for all 
production is determined pursuant to section 613A(b)) for which 
percentage depletion would exceed cost depletion in the absence of the 
depletable quantity limitations contained in section 613A(c) (1) and (6) 
and the consolidated taxable income limitation contained in paragraph 
(a) of this section.
    (2) Any consolidated net operating loss carryback to the 
consolidated return year under Sec. Sec. 1.1502-21 or 1.1502-21A (as 
appropriate) and
    (3) Any consolidated net capital loss carryback to the consolidated 
return year under Sec. Sec. 1.1502-22 or 1.1502-22A (as appropriate).
    (c) Allocation to oil and gas properties. The maximum amount 
allowable as a deduction under section 613A(c), after the application of 
paragraph (a) of this section, is allocated to properties held by 
members in accordance with the regulations under section 613A(d). Those 
regulations provide for an initial allocation and possible reallocation 
of the maximum allowable percentage depletion deduction among oil and 
gas properties. Thus, if, after the initial allocation, cost depletion 
exceeds the percentage depletion that would be allowable for a 
particular oil or gas property, cost depletion must be used for that 
property and the maximum amount of percentage depletion allowable as a 
deduction for the group is reallocated among only the remaining 
properties held by all members.
    (d) Carryover for disallowed amounts. (1) If any amount is 
disallowed as a deduction for the taxable year by reason of section 
613A(d)(1) or paragraph (a) of this section, the disallowed amount for 
each oil or gas property is treated as an amount allowed as a deduction 
under section 613A(c), for the following taxable year for the member 
that owned the property, in accordance with the regulations under 
section 613A and paragraphs (a) and (d)(2) of this section.
    (2) Any amount that was disallowed as a deduction in a separate 
return limitation year of a member may be carried to a consolidated 
return year only to the extent that 65 percent of the excess determined 
under paragraph (d)(3) of this section exceeds the sum of the otherwise 
allowable percentage depletion deductions for the member's oil and gas 
properties for the year.
    (3) The excess determined in this subparagraph (3) for a member is 
the excess, if any, of adjusted consolidated taxable income for the year 
under paragraph (b) of this section over that income recomputed by 
excluding the items of income and deductions of the member.
    (e) Effective date. This section applies to taxable years for which 
the due date (without extensions) for filing returns is after September 
30, 1980.

Sec. 1.1502-47  Consolidated returns by life- nonlife groups.

    (a) Scope--(1) In general. Under section 1504(b)(2), insurance 
companies that are taxed under section 802 or 821 (relating respectively 
to life insurance companies and to certain mutual insurance companies) 
are not treated as includible corporations for purposes of determining 
under section 1504(a) the existence of an affiliated group and the 
composition of its membership. Section 1504(c)(2) provides an election 
whereby certain life insurance companies and mutual insurance companies 
may be treated as includible corporations, and thus members, of a group 
composed of other includible corporations. This section provides 
regulations for the making of this election and for the determination of 
an electing group's composition and its consolidated tax liability.
    (2) General method of consolidation--(i) Subgroup method. The 
regulations adopt a subgroup method to determine consolidated taxable 
income. One subgroup

[[Page 433]]

is the group's nonlife companies (including those taxable under section 
821). The other subgroup is the group's life insurance companies. 
Initially, the nonlife subgroup computes nonlife consolidated taxable 
income and the life subgroup computes consolidated partial life 
insurance company taxable income. A subgroup's income may in effect be 
reduced by a loss of the other subgroup. The life subgroup losses 
consist of consolidated loss from operations and life consolidated net 
capital loss. The nonlife subgroup losses consist of nonlife 
consolidated net operating loss and nonlife consolidated net capital 
loss. Consolidated taxable income is therefore defined in pertinent part 
as the sum of nonlife consolidated taxable income and consolidated 
partial life insurance company taxable income reduced by life subgroup 
losses or nonlife subgroup losses.
    (ii) Subgroup loss. A subgroup loss does not actually affect the 
computation of nonlife consolidated taxable income or consolidated 
partial life insurance company taxable income. It merely constitutes a 
bottom-line adjustment in reaching consolidated taxable income. 
Furthermore, one subgroup's loss must first be carried back against 
income of the same subgroup before it may be used as a setoff against 
the second subgroup income in the taxable year the loss arose. (See 
section 1503(c)(1)). The carryback of the losses from one subgroup may 
not be used to offset income of the other subgroup in the year to which 
the loss is to be carried. This carryback of the first subgroup's loss 
may ``bump'' the second subgroup's loss that in effect previously 
reduced the income of the first subgroup. The second subgroup's loss 
that is bumped in appropriate cases may in effect reduce a succeeding 
year's income of the second or first subgroup. This approach gives the 
group the tax savings of the use of losses but the bumping rule assures 
that insofar as possible life deductions will be matched against life 
income and nonlife deductions against nonlife income.
    (iii) Carryover of subgroup loss. A subgroup's loss may be used in a 
succeeding year, but in any particular succeeding year the loss must be 
used to reduce the income of the same subgroup before it may be used as 
a setoff against the other subgroup's income.
    (3) Authority. This section is prescribed under the authority of 
sections 1502, 1503(c), 1504(c)(2), and 7805(b).
    (4) Other provisions. The provisions of Sec. Sec. 1.1502-1 through 
1.1502-80 apply unless this section provides otherwise. Further, unless 
otherwise indicated in this section, a term used in this section has the 
same meaning as in sections 801-844.
    (b) Effective date. This section is effective for taxable years for 
which the due date (without extensions) for filing returns is after 
March 14, 1983.
    (c) Cross references. The following table provides cross references 
for some of the definitions and operating rules that are relevant in 
making the election and determining the group's composition and its tax 
liability:

                           Item and Paragraph

    General definitions (d).
    Eligible corporation (Five-year rules) (d)(12).
    Election (e).
    Consolidated taxable income (g).
    Nonlife consolidated taxable income (h).
    Consolidated partial life insurance company taxable income (j).
    Nonlife subgroup losses (m).
    Life subgroup losses (n).
    Alternative tax (o).

    (d) Definitions. For purposes of this section:
    (1) Life insurance company. The term ``life company'' means a life 
insurance company as defined in section 801. Section 801 applies to each 
company separately.
    (2) Mutual insurance company. The term ``mutual company'' means a 
mutual insurance company taxable under section 821(a)(1).
    (3) Life insurance company taxable income. The term ``life insurance 
company taxable income'' is referred to as LICTI. The terms ``TII'', 
``GO'', and ``LO'' refer, respectively, to taxable investment income 
(section 804), gain from operations (section 809), and loss from 
operations (section 812). The term ``consolidated partial LICTI'' refers 
to consolidated LICTI without section 802(b)(3).
    (4) Group. The term ``group'' means an affiliated group of 
corporations (as

[[Page 434]]

defined in section 1504(a)). Unless otherwise indicated in this section, 
a group's composition is determined without section 1504(b)(2).
    (5) Member. The term ``member'' means a corporation (including the 
common parent) that is an includible corporation in the group. A life 
company or mutual company is tentatively treated as a member for any 
taxable year for purposes of determining if it is an eligible 
corporation under paragraph (d)(12) of this section and therefore if it 
is an includible corporation under section 1504(c)(2). If such a company 
is eligible and includible (under section 1504(c)(2)), it will actually 
be treated as a member of the group.
    (6) Life member. A life member is a member of the group that is a 
life company.
    (7) Nonlife member. A nonlife member is a member of the group that 
is not a life company.
    (8) Life subgroup. A life subgroup is composed of those members that 
are life members. If the group has only one life member, it constitutes 
a life subgroup.
    (9) Nonlife subgroup. A nonlife subgroup is composed of those 
members that are nonlife members. If the group has only one nonlife 
member, it constitutes a nonlife subgroup.
    (10) Separate return year. The term ``separate return year'' means a 
taxable year of a corporation for which it files a separate return or 
for which it joins in the filing of a consolidated return by another 
group. For purposes of this subparagraph (10), the term ``group'' is 
defined with regard to section 1504(b)(2) for years in which an election 
under section 1504(c)(2) is not in effect. Thus, a separate return year 
includes a taxable year for which that election is not in effect.
    (11) Separate return limitation year. Section 1.1502-1(f)(2) 
provides exceptions to the definition of the term ``separate return 
limitation year''. For purposes of applying those exceptions to this 
section, for taxable years ending after December 31, 1980, the term 
``group'' is defined without regard to section 1504(b)(2) and the 
definition in this subparagraph (11) applies separately to the nonlife 
subgroup in determining nonlife consolidated taxable income under 
paragraph (h) of this section and to the life subgroup in determining 
consolidated partial LICTI under paragraph (j) of this section. 
Paragraph (m)(3)(ix) of this section defines the term ``separate return 
limitation year'' for purposes of determining whether the losses of one 
subgroup may be used against the income of the other subgroup.
    (12) Eligible corporations--(i) In general. A corporation is an 
eligible corporation for a taxable year of a group only if, throughout 
every day of the base period the corporation:
    (A) Was in existence and a member of the group determined without 
the exclusions in section 1504(b)(2) (see paragraphs (d)(12) (iii) 
through (vi) of this section),
    (B) Was engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business 
(``active business''),
    (C) Did not experience a change in tax character (see paragraph 
(d)(12)(vii) of this section), and
    (D) Did not undergo disproportionate asset acquisitions (see 
paragraph (d)(12)(viii) of this section).
    (ii) Base period. The base period consists of the common parent's 
five taxable years immediately preceding the group's taxable year for 
which the consolidated return and the determination of eligibility are 
made. Eligibility is determined for each consolidated return year 
beginning with the first year for which the election under section 
1504(c)(2) is effective.
    (iii) In existence. Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(12) (v) and 
(vi) of this section, a corporation organized after the base period 
begins is not eligible even though it is a member of the group 
immediately after its organization. For purposes of this subdivision 
(iii), a corporation that was a party to a reorganization described in 
section 368(a)(1)(F) shall be treated as the same entity both before and 
after the reorganization.
    (iv) Membership period. Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(12) (v) 
and (vi) of this section, a corporation must have been a member of the 
group throughout the base period to be eligible. Thus, an ineligible 
corporation includes one whose stock was acquired from outside the group 
at any time

[[Page 435]]

during the base period or one which was a member of a different group 
(whether by application of reverse acquistion rules in Sec. 1.1502-
75(d)(3) or otherwise) at any time during the base period. For purposes 
of this subdivision (iv), the common parent of a group is treated as 
constituting a group (and hence is a member) during any period when it 
was not a member of an affiliated group within the meaning of section 
1504(a) (applied without section 1504(b)(2)).
    (v) Tacking rule. The period during which an ``old'' corporation is 
in existence and a member of the group engaged in active business is 
included in (or ``tacks'' onto) the period for the ``new'' corporation 
if the following five conditions listed in this subdivision (v) are met. 
For purposes of this subparagraph (12), a ``new'' corporation is a 
corporation (whether or not newly organized) during the period its 
eligibility depends upon the tacking rule. The five conditions are as 
follows:
    (A) The first condition is that, at any time, 80 percent or more of 
the new corporation's assets it acquired (other than in the ordinary 
course of its trade or business) where acquired from the old corporation 
in one or more transactions described in section 351(a) or 381(a). This 
asset test is applied by using the fair market values of assets on the 
date they were acquired and without regard to liabilities. Assets 
acquired in the ordinary course of business will be excluded from total 
assets only if they were acquired after the new corporation became a 
member of the group (determined without section 1504(b)(2)). In 
addition, assets that the old corporation acquired from outside the 
group in transactions not conducted in the ordinary course of its trade 
or business are not included in the 80 percent (but are included in 
total assets) if the old corporation acquired those assets within five 
calendar years before the date of their transfer to the new corporation.
    (B) The second condition is that at the end of the taxable year 
during which the first condition is first met, the old corporation and 
the new corporation must both have the same tax character. For purposes 
of this paragraph (d)(12), a corporation's tax character is the section 
under which it would be taxed (i.e., sections 11, 802, 821, or 831) if 
it filed a separate return. If the old corporation is not in existence 
(or adopts a plan of complete liquidation) at the end of that taxable 
year, this subdivision (v)(B) will apply to the old corporation's 
taxable year immediately preceding the beginning of the taxable year 
during which the first condition is first met.
    (C) The third condition is that, if the old and new corporation are 
life insurance companies, the transfer (or transfers) is not reasonably 
expected (at the time of the transfer) to result in the separation of 
profitable activities from loss activities.
    (D) The fourth condition is that, at the end of the taxable year 
during which the first condition is first met, the new corporation does 
not undergo a disproportionate asset acquisition under paragraph 
(d)(12)(viii) of this section.
    (E) The fifth condition is that, if there is more than one old 
corporation, the first three conditions apply to all of the 
corporations. Thus, the second condition (tax character) must be met by 
all of the old corporations transferring assets taken into account in 
meeting the test in paragraph (d)(12)(v)(A) of this section.
    (vi) Old group remaining in existence. If the common parent of a 
group (or a new common parent) became the common parent in a transaction 
described in Sec. 1.1502-75 (d)(2) or (d)(3) where a group remained in 
existence, then paragraph (d)(12) (ii) through (iv) of this section 
apply by treating that common parent as if it were also the previous 
common parent of the group that remains in existence. If this paragraph 
(d)(12)(vi) applies to a transaction, the tacking rule in paragraph 
(d)(12)(v) of this section does not apply to the transaction.
    (vii) Change in tax character. A corporation must not experience 
during the base period a change in tax character (as defined in 
paragraph (d)(12)(v)(B) of this section) if the change is attributable 
to an acquisition of assets from outside the group in transactions not 
conducted in the ordinary course of its trade or business. However, if a 
new corporation relies on

[[Page 436]]

the tacking rules in paragraph (d)(12)(v) of this section, this 
paragraph (d)(12)(vii) shall apply during the base period and the 
current consolidated return year and even if the change in tax character 
is attributable to an asset acquisition from within the group.
    (viii) Disproportionate asset acquisition. To be eligible, a 
corporation must not undergo during the base period disproportionate 
asset acquisitions which are attributable to an acquisition (or a series 
of acquisitions) of assets from outside the group in transactions not 
conducted in the ordinary course of its trade or business (special 
acquisition). Whether special acquisitions are disproportionate is 
determined at the end of each base period. Whether an acquisition 
results in a disproportionate asset acquisition depends on all of the 
facts and circumstances including the following factors and rules:
    (A) One factor is the portion of the insurance reserves (i.e., total 
reserves in section 801 (c)) of the acquiring company at the end of the 
base period which is attributable to special acquisitions.
    (B) A second factor is the portion of the fair market value of the 
assets (without reduction for liabilities) of the acquiring company at 
the end of the base period that is attributable to special acquisitions.
    (C) A third factor is the portion of the premiums generated during 
the last taxable year of the base period which are attributable to 
special acquisitions.
    (D) A corporation will not experience a disproportionate asset 
acquisition unless 75 percent of one factor (whether or not listed in 
this subdivision (viii)) is attributable to special acquisitions.
    (E) Money or other property contributed to a corporation by a 
shareholder that is not a member of the group (without section 
1504(b)(2)) is not a special acquisition.
    (F) If a new corporation relies on the tacking rules in paragraph 
(d)(12)(v) of this section, this subdivision (viii) applies to that 
corporation during a consolidated return year. Thus, if at any time 
during a consolidated return year, a new corporation undergoes a 
disproportionate asset acquisition, the corporation becomes ineligible 
at that time.
    (13) Ineligible corporation. A corporation that is not an eligible 
corporation is ineligible. If a life company or mutual company is 
ineligible, it is not treated under section 1504(c)(2) as an includible 
corporation. Losses of a nonlife member arising in years when it is 
ineligible may not be used under section 1503(c)(2) and paragraph (m) of 
this section to set off the income of a life member. If a life or mutual 
company is ineligible and is the common parent of the group (without 
section 1504(b)(2)), the election under section 1504(c)(2) may not be 
made.
    (14) Illustrations. The following examples illustrate this paragraph 
(d). In each example, L indicates a life company, another letter 
indicates a nonlife company, and each corporation uses the calendar year 
as its taxable year.

    Example (1). P has owned all of the stock of S since 1913. On 
January 1, 1980, P purchased all of the stock of L<INF>1</INF> which 
owns all of the stock of L<INF>2</INF> and S<INF>2</INF>. L<INF>1</INF> 
and L<INF>2</INF> are treated as members for purposes of determining if 
they are eligible for 1982. However, for 1982, L<INF>1</INF>, 
L<INF>2</INF>, and S<INF>2</INF> are ineligible because none of them has 
been a member of the group for P's five taxable years preceding 1982. 
For 1982, L<INF>1</INF> and L<INF>2</INF> may elect to file a 
consolidated return because they constitute an affiliated group under 
section 1504(c)(1), and P and S may file a consolidated return.
    Example (2). Since 1974, P has been a mutual insurance company 
owning all the stock of L<INF>1</INF>. In 1980, P transfers assets to 
S<INF>1</INF>., a new stock casualty company subject to taxation under 
section 831(a). For 1982, only P and L<INF>1</INF> are eligible 
corporations. The tacking rule in paragraph (d)(12)(v) of this section 
does not apply in 1982 because the old corporation (P) and the new 
corporation (S<INF>1</INF>) do not have the same tax character. The 
result would be the same if P were a life company.
    Example (3). Since 1974, L has owned all the stock of L<INF>1</INF> 
which has owned all the stock of S<INF>1</INF>, a stock casualty 
company. L<INF>1</INF> writes some accident and health insurance 
business. In 1980, L<INF>1</INF> transfers this business, and 
S<INF>1</INF> transfers some of its business, to a new stock casualty 
company, S<INF>2</INF>., in a transaction described in section 351 (a). 
The property transferred to S<INF>2</INF>. by L<INF>1</INF> had a fair 
market value of $50 million. The property transferred by S<INF>1</INF> 
had a fair market value of $40 million. S<INF>2</INF>. is ineligible for 
1982 because the tacking rule in paragraph (d)(12)(v) of this section 
does not apply. The old corporations (L<INF>1</INF> and S<INF>1</INF>) 
and the new corporation (S<INF>2</INF>.) do not all have the same tax 
character. See subparagraph

[[Page 437]]

(d)(12)(v)(B) and (E) of this section. The result would be the same if 
L<INF>1</INF> transferred other property (e.g., stock and securities) 
with the same value, rather than accident and health insurance 
contracts, to S<INF>2</INF>.
    Example (4). Since 1974, P has owned all the stock of S and 
L<INF>1</INF>. L<INF>1</INF> is a large life company engaged in active 
business since 1974. On January 1, 1982, L<INF>1</INF> transfers in a 
section 351 (a) transaction assets (not acquired from outside the group) 
to a new life company, L<INF>2</INF>. For 1982, L<INF>2</INF> is 
eligible because under paragraph (d)(12)(v) of this section, 
L<INF>2</INF> is considered to have been in existence and a member of 
the group engaged in the active business since 1974 which is the period 
L<INF>1</INF>, the old corporation, was in existence and a member of the 
group so engaged.
    Example (5). The facts are the same as in example (4). Assume that 
the fair market value of the assets L<INF>1</INF> transferred to 
L<INF>2</INF> was $10 million on January 1, 1982 and that L<INF>2</INF> 
acquired no other assets prior to June 30, 1983. Assume further that on 
January 1, 1983, L<INF>1</INF> acquires (other than in the ordinary 
course of its trade or business) assets having a fair market value of 
$40 million from L<INF>3</INF>, an unrelated life company. On June 30, 
1983, L<INF>1</INF> transfers those assets to L<INF>2</INF>. 
L<INF>2</INF> becomes ineligible on June 30, 1983. Since by fair market 
values, 80 percent (i.e., 40/50) of L<INF>2</INF>'s assets are 
attributable to special acquisitions, L<INF>2</INF> has undergone a 
disproportionate asset acquisition at that time. See paragraph 
(d)(12)(viii)(B), (D), and (F) of this section.
    Example (6). The facts are the same as in example (5) except that 
L<INF>1</INF> transfers assets (other than life insurance contracts) 
having a fair market value of $40 million to L<INF>2</INF> and 
L<INF>2</INF> purchases the assets of L<INF>3</INF> on June 30, 1983. 
the result of the 1983 acquisition is the same as in example (5).
    Example (7). The facts are the same as in example (5) except the 
acquired assets acquired by L<INF>2</INF> in 1983 from L<INF>1</INF> 
have a fair market value of $20 million. In 1983, L<INF>2</INF> had $1 
million of premiums on its pre-existing contracts but premiums generated 
by the acquired business for the entire year would have been $2 million. 
L<INF>2</INF> is eligible in 1983 because it did not experience a 
disproportionate asset acquisition on June 30, 1983.
    Example (8). Since 1974, L, a State A corporation, has owned all of 
the stock of L<INF>1</INF> and S<INF>1</INF>. On January 1, 1982, L 
merges into L<INF>3</INF>, a smaller State B corporation, which owns the 
stock of S<INF>2</INF>. The transaction is a reverse acquisition 
described in Sec. 1.1502-75(d)(3) and the group of which L was the 
common parent remains in existence. Under paragraph (d)(12)(vi) of this 
section, L<INF>3</INF> is eligible for 1982. However, S<INF>2</INF> is 
ineligible in 1982 under paragraph (d)(12)(iv) of this section.
    Example (9). The facts are the same as in example (8) except that L 
acquires the stock of L<INF>3</INF>. L<INF>3</INF> and S<INF>2</INF> are 
both ineligible for 1982. On January 1, 1983, the fair market value of 
L<INF>3</INF>'s assets are $5 million (without liabilities) and on that 
date L transfers assets (not acquired from outside the group) having a 
fair market value of $95 million (without liabilities) to L<INF>3</INF>. 
L and L<INF>3</INF> are life companies at the end of 1983. L<INF>3</INF> 
is eligible in 1983 under the tacking rule in paragraph (d)(12)(v) of 
this section. S<INF>2</INF> is ineligible in that year. The result would 
be the same if L<INF>3</INF> was not a life company prior to January 1, 
1983. See paragraph (d)(12)(v)(B) of this section.
    Example (10). Since 1974, P has owned all of the stock of 
S<INF>1</INF> and L<INF>1</INF>. On January 1, 1982, L<INF>1</INF> 
incorporates L<INF>2</INF> and transfers cash and securities to 
L<INF>2</INF>. L<INF>2</INF> begins writing a new line of specialty life 
insurance products and it qualifies as a life company for calendar year 
1982. L<INF>2</INF> generates a loss from operations (section 812) 
attributable to its writing of new business. For 1982, L<INF>2</INF> is 
ineligible under paragraph (d)(12)(v)(C) of this section.
    Example (11). The facts are the same as in example (10) except that 
L<INF>1</INF> transfers to L<INF>2</INF> a block of insurance contracts 
that generated losses for L<INF>1</INF> and continued to generate losses 
for L<INF>2</INF>, producing a loss from operations. L<INF>2</INF> is 
ineligible in 1982 under paragraph (d)(12)(v)(C) of this section.
    Example (12). Since 1974, X, a foreign corporation, has owned all 
the stock of S<INF>2</INF> and S<INF>1</INF>, and S<INF>1</INF> has 
owned all of the stock of L<INF>1</INF>. On January 1, 1982, X 
incorporates a new U.S. company P, and transfers the stock of 
S<INF>1</INF> and S<INF>2</INF> to P. Assume that under Sec. 1.1502-
75(d)(3) (relating to reverse acquisitions), the S<INF>1</INF>-
L<INF>1</INF> affiliated group remains in existence. Under paragraph 
(d)(12)(vi) of this section, P, S<INF>1</INF>, and L<INF>1</INF> are 
eligible but S<INF>2</INF> is ineligible. The result would be the same 
if X were an individual.
    Example (13). The facts are the same as in example (12) except that 
X owns all of the stock of S<INF>1</INF>, L<INF>1</INF>, and 
S<INF>2</INF>. In addition, on January 1, 1982, X transfers the stock of 
S<INF>1</INF> and S<INF>2</INF> to L<INF>1</INF>. L<INF>1</INF> is 
eligible in 1982 under paragraph (d)(12)(iv) of this section. 
L<INF>1</INF> would still be eligible even if it owned a subsidiary 
during the base period but sold the subsidiary prior to January 1, 1982. 
S<INF>1</INF> and S<INF>2</INF> are ineligible in 1982.
    Example (14). Since 1974, S<INF>1</INF> has owned all of the stock 
of L<INF>1</INF>. S<INF>2</INF>, an unrelated company, has owned all of 
the stock of L<INF>2</INF> and S<INF>3</INF> for 10 years. S<INF>1</INF> 
and S<INF>2</INF> are active stock casualty companies and not holding 
companies. On January 1, 1982, S<INF>1</INF> and S<INF>2</INF> merge 
into a new casualty company, S, in a transaction described in Sec. 
1.1502-75(d)(3) so that the group of which S<INF>1</INF> was the common 
parent remains in existence. S and L<INF>1</INF> are eligible in 1982 
under paragraph (d)(12)(vi) of this section. L<INF>2</INF> and 
S<INF>3</INF> are ineligible.
    Example (15). The facts are the same as in example (14) except that 
S<INF>2</INF> (the first corporation in Sec. 1.1502-75(d)(3)) acquires 
the stock of S<INF>1</INF> in exchange for the stock of S<INF>2</INF>.

[[Page 438]]

The result is that only S<INF>2</INF>, S<INF>1</INF>, and L<INF>1</INF> 
are eligible in 1982.
    Example (16). Since 1974, S had owned all of the stock of 
L<INF>1</INF>. L<INF>1</INF> is a large life company. On January 1, 
1982, L<INF>1</INF> incorporates L<INF>2</INF> and transfers $40 million 
in cash and securities to L<INF>2</INF> in a transaction described in 
section 351(a). On March 1, 1982, L<INF>2</INF> purchases the assets of 
L<INF>3</INF>, an unrelated life company. The purchased assets have a 
fair market value (without liabilities) of $30 million on March 1, 1982. 
L<INF>2</INF> is ineligible for 1982 because the tacking rule in 
paragraph (d)(12)(v) of this section does not apply. L<INF>2</INF> 
experienced a disproportionate asset acquisition in 1982. See paragraph 
(d)(12)((v)(D) of this section.

    (e) Election--(1) In general. The election under section 1504(c)(2) 
may not be made if the group's common parent is an ineligible life 
company or an ineligible mutual company. The election under section 
1504(c)(2) may only be made by the common parent of the group (as 
defined in section 1504(c)(2) without the exclusions in section 
1504(b)(2)). For example, assume that P owns all of the stock of 
L<INF>1</INF>, an eligible life company, which owns the stock of 
S<INF>1</INF>. Assume further that P also owns the stock of 
L<INF>2</INF>, an ineligible life member, which (for more than five 
years) has owned the stock of a nonlife company, S<INF>2</INF>. Only P 
may make the election and, if it does so, P, L<INF>1</INF>, and 
S<INF>1</INF> may file a consolidated return under this section. 
L<INF>2</INF> may not make the election under section 1504(c)(2) and may 
not file a consolidated return with S<INF>2</INF>.
    (2) How election is made--(i) General rule. The election under 
section 1504(c)(2) is generally made by the group's common parent in the 
same manner (and it has the same effect) as the election to file a 
consolidated return is made under Sec. 1.1502-75 (a) and (b) for a 
group which did not file a consolidated return for the immediately 
preceding taxable year. The procedure for making the election under 
section 1504(c)(2) is the same whether or not a consolidated return was 
filed by the life members or the nonlife members for the immediately 
preceding taxable year.
    (ii) Special rule. Notwithstanding the general rule, however, if the 
nonlife members in the group filed a consolidated return for the 
immediately preceding taxable year and had executed and filed a Form 
1122 that is effective for the preceding year, then such members will be 
treated as if they filed a Form 1122 when they join in the filing of a 
consolidated return under section 1504(c)(2) and they will be deemed to 
consent to the regulations under this section. However, an affiliation 
schedule (Form 851) must be filed by the group and the life members must 
execute a Form 1122 in the manner prescribed in Sec. 1.1502-75(h)(2).
    (3) Irrevocability. Except as provided in Sec. 1.1502-75(c) and 
paragraph (e)(4) of this section, the election under section 1504(c)(2) 
is irrevocable.
    (4) Permission to discontinue--(i) General rule. A ``section 
1504(c)(2) group'' with a common parent that has made the election to 
file a consolidated return under section 1504(c)(2) in a previous 
taxable year is granted permission to elect (under Sec. 1.1502-
75(c)(2)(ii)) to discontinue filing such a consolidated return for that 
group's first taxable year for which the regulations under this section 
are effective. This election to discontinue shall be exercised in the 
time and manner prescribed in Sec. 1.1502-75(c)(3), except that the 
group's common parent shall exercise this election to discontinue (and 
the other members of the section 1504(c)(2) group must comply with this 
election) by filing appropriate returns. For purposes of this paragraph 
(e)(4), an appropriate return is either a separate return or a 
consolidated return that is filed by newly exercising the privilege 
under Sec. 1.1502-75(a)(1).
    (ii) Types of groups. (A) A ``section 1504(c)(2) group'' is an 
affiliated group which files or filed a consolidated return pursuant to 
an election under section 1504(c)(2).
    (B) A ``limited group'' is an affiliated group (determined without 
section 1504(c)(2)) having at least one member which was a member of a 
section 1504(c)(2) group on the date that the section 1504(c)(2) group 
elected to discontinue under paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section.
    (iii) Effect on restoration rules. If a group ceases to file a 
consolidated return or terminates or if a member leaves the group, 
certain items of income, gain, or loss on transactions between members 
are taken into account under Sec. Sec. 1.1502-13, 1.1502-18, and 
1.1502-19 (``restoration rules''). For purposes of

[[Page 439]]

applying these restoration rules solely by reason of an election under 
paragraph (e)(4)(i) or (e)(4)(v)(A) of this section to discontinue 
filing consolidated returns as a section 1504(c)(2) group, the following 
rules apply:
    (A) The section 1504(c)(2) group shall not be considered to 
terminate and no member of that group shall be treated as ceasing to be 
a member.
    (B) Members of that section 1504(c)(2) group that are included in 
the consolidated return of a limited group for the first taxable year 
for which the discontinuance is effective shall be considered to be 
filing a consolidated return as a continuation of the section 1504(c)(2) 
group. However, a corporation that is not a member of a particular 
limited group for that taxable year is considered to have a separate 
return year (and, for purposes of Sec. 1.1502-19(c), not to be a member 
of a group filing a consolidated return) with respect to that limited 
group's members.
    (C) Section 1.1502-13 shall be applied without regard to paragraph 
(f)(1)(vii).
    (iv) Illustrations. The following examples illustrate paragraph 
(e)(4)(i)-(iii) of this section. In these examples, L indicates a life 
company and another letter indicates a nonlife company. All corporations 
use the calendar year as the taxable year. For all taxable years 
involved, P owns all the stock of L<INF>1</INF> and of S, L<INF>1</INF> 
owns all the stock of L<INF>2</INF>, L<INF>2</INF> owns all the stock of 
L<INF>3</INF>, and S owns all the stock of L<INF>4</INF>. For 1981, P 
makes the life-nonlife election of section 1504(c)(2) and L<INF>4</INF> 
is an eligible corporation. For 1982, P makes the election to 
discontinue filing consolidated returns under section 1504(c)(2) in 
accordance with the permission granted in this paragraph (e)(4).

    Example (1). L<INF>1</INF>, L<INF>2</INF>, and L<INF>3</INF> were 
eligible members. For 1982, P and S may either file separate returns or 
may file, as a limited group, a consolidated return. Similarly, 
L<INF>1</INF>, L<INF>2</INF>, and L<INF>3</INF> may either file separate 
returns or may file a consolidated return as a limited group under 
section 1504(c)(1). L<INF>4</INF> must file a separate return.
    Example (2). For 1981, L<INF>1</INF> was an ineligible member and 
L<INF>1</INF>, L<INF>2</INF>, and L<INF>3</INF> filed a consolidated 
return under section 1504(c)(1). For 1982, L<INF>1</INF>, L<INF>2</INF>, 
and L<INF>3</INF> must continue filing a consolidated return under 
section 1504(c)(1).
    Example (3). For 1981, L<INF>1</INF> was an eligible member and 
L<INF>2</INF> and L<INF>3</INF> were ineligible members. For 1982, 
L<INF>1</INF>, L<INF>2</INF>, and L<INF>3</INF> either must each file a 
separate return or must file a consolidated return as a limited group 
under section 1504(c)(1) having L<INF>1</INF> as a common parent.
    Example (4). The facts are the same as in example (3). Assume 
further that for 1981, L<INF>2</INF> and L<INF>3</INF> file a 
consolidated return. During 1981, intercompany transactions (see Sec. 
1.1502-13) occur in the life-nonlife group between P and L<INF>1</INF>, 
between P and S, and between S and L<INF>4</INF> and occur in the 
ineligible life subgroup between L<INF>2</INF> and L<INF>3</INF>. For 
1982, the restoration rules of Sec. 1.1502-13, as modified by paragraph 
(e)(4)(iii)(B) of this section, will be applicable as indicated in the 
following table:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Intercompany transactions between             Sec.  1.1502-13
------------------------------------------------------------------------
P and L1...............................          Yes.
P and S, if they file:
  Separate returns.....................          Yes.
  A consolidated return................          No.
S and L4...............................          Yes.
L2 and L3, if L1, L2, and L3 file:
  Separate returns.....................          Yes.
  A consolidated return................          No.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (v) Additional rules. (A) If a group with a taxable year ending in 
the month of December, 1982, had made the election under section 
1504(c)(2) for a taxable year ending prior to December 1, 1982, and if 
that group meets the conditions of subdivision (vi) of this paragraph 
(e)(4), then the common parent may elect to discontinue filing a 
consolidated return for its taxable year ending in the month of 
December, 1982 (and other members of the section 1504(c)(2) group must 
comply with this election) by filing appropriate returns (see paragraph 
(e)(4)(i) of this section) before September 16, 1983.
    (B) If a group made the election under section 1504(c)(2) for its 
taxable year ending in the month of December, 1982, and if that group 
meets the conditions of subdivision (vi) of this paragraph (e)(4), then 
the common parent may elect to withdraw the section 1504(c)(2) election 
(and all other members of the group determined without section 
1504(b)(2) comply with the election) by filing before September 16, 
1983, any returns for the appropriate taxable years that would have been 
filed had the section 1504(c)(2) election never been made.
    (vi) A group referred to at subdivision (v)(A) or (B) of this (e)(4) 
meets the conditions of this subdivision (vi) if it--

[[Page 440]]

    (A) filed before March 16, 1983, a return for its taxable year 
ending in the month of December, 1982, and
    (B) had not been granted an extension of time beyond March 15, 1983, 
for the filing of that return.
    (vii) Interest. For purposes of section 6601(a), interest runs from 
the original due date (without extensions) for the filing of such 
returns as are filed pursuant to an election (to discontinue or withdraw 
as the case may be) under this paragraph (e)(4).
    (5) Consent to regulations. If a group does not discontinue filing a 
consolidated return under paragraph (e)(4) of this section but continues 
to file a consolidated return for the group's first taxable year for 
which the regulations under this section are first effective, the 
members of the group will be deemed to have consented to the regulations 
under this section.
    (6) Cross reference. If an election is made under section 
1504(c)(2), see Sec. 1.1502-75 (e) and (f) for rules that apply for not 
including (or including) a member or a nonmember in the consolidated 
return.
    (f) Effect of election. If the common parent makes the election 
under section 1504(c)(2), the following rules apply:
    (1) Termination of group. A mere election under section 1504(c)(2) 
will not cause the creation of a new group or the termination of an 
affiliated group that files a consolidated return in the immediately 
preceding taxable year.
    (2) Effect of eligibility. If a life member is eligible after an 
election under section 1504(c)(2), it may not be included as a member of 
an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(c)(1).
    (3) Eligible and ineligible life companies. If any life company was 
a member of an affiliated group of life companies (as defined in section 
1504(c)(1)) but is ineligible for a taxable year for which the election 
under section 1504(c)(2) is effective, that year is not a separate 
return year merely by reason of the election under section 1504(c)(2) in 
applying Sec. Sec. 1.1502-13, 1.1502-18, and 1.1502-19 to transactions 
occurring in prior consolidated return years of that affiliated group. 
In addition, if more than one ineligible life member of the group (as 
defined in section 1504(c)(1)) joined in the filing of a consolidated 
return in the taxable year immediately preceding the year for which the 
election under section 1504(c)(2) is effective and, solely as a result 
of the election, one of the ineligible life members becomes the common 
parent of such a group (section 1504(c)(1)), the group must continue to 
file a consolidated return. For example, assume that L<INF>1</INF> owns 
all of the stock of S<INF>1</INF> and all of the stock of L<INF>2</INF>. 
L<INF>2</INF> owns the stock of L<INF>3</INF>. L<INF>1</INF>, 
L<INF>2</INF>, and L<INF>3</INF> are life companies and S<INF>1</INF> is 
a nonlife company. Assume further that in 1981, L<INF>1</INF>, 
L<INF>2</INF>, and L<INF>3</INF> file a consolidated return but 
L<INF>1</INF> makes the election under section 1504(c)(2) for 1982 and 
L<INF>2</INF> and L<INF>3</INF> are ineligible. L<INF>2</INF> and 
L<INF>3</INF> must continue to file a consolidated return in 1982. 
Moreover, L<INF>2</INF> could elect in 1982 to file a consolidated 
return (section 1504(c)(1)) with L<INF>3</INF> even if they did not file 
a consolidated return in 1981 with L<INF>1</INF>.
    (4) Inclusion of life company. If a life company is ineligible in 
the consolidated return year for which the election is effective, it 
will be treated as an includible corporation for the common parent's 
first taxable year in which the company becomes eligible.
    (5) Dividends received deduction. Section 243(b)(5) defines the term 
affiliated group for purposes of the election to deduct 100 percent of 
the qualifying dividends received by a member from another member of the 
group. Section 246(b)(6) limits certain multiple tax benefits and the 
deduction itself. Section 243(b) (5) and (6) do not apply to the mutual 
companies and life companies that are eligible corporations. See section 
1504(c)(2)(B)(i). Thus, the common parent of the group may elect to 
deduct 100 percent of the qualifying dividends received from an 
ineligible life company.
    (6) Controlled group. Sections 1563 (a)(4), (b)(2)(D), and (b)(3)(C) 
(insofar as it applies to corporations described in section 
1563(b)(2)(D)) do not apply to any eligible or ineligible life company 
that is a member of the group for a taxable year during which the 
election is effective. See paragraph (d)(4) of this section for the 
definition of group.
    (7) Consolidated tax. The tax liability of a group for a 
consolidated return year (before application of credits

[[Page 441]]

against that tax) is computed on a consolidated basis by adding together 
the following taxes:
    (i) The tax imposed under section 11 on consolidated taxable income 
(as determined under paragraph (g) of this section). The taxes imposed 
under sections 802(a), 821(a), and 831(a) will each be treated as a tax 
imposed under section 11.
    (ii) The tax imposed by section 1201 on consolidated net capital 
gain (as determined under paragraph (o) of this section) in lieu of the 
tax imposed under paragraph (f)(7)(i) of this section on that gain.
    (iii) Any taxes described in Sec. 1.1502-2 (other than by 
paragraphs (a), (f), and (h) thereof).
    (g) Consolidated taxable income. The consolidated taxable income is 
the sum of the following three amounts:
    (1) Nonlife consolidated taxable income. The nonlife consolidated 
taxable income (as defined in paragraph (h) of this section) of the 
nonlife subgroup, as set off by the life subgroup losses as provided in 
paragraph (n) of this section. The amount in this paragraph (g)(1) may 
not be less than zero.
    (2) Consolidated partial LICTI. The consolidated partial LICTI (as 
defined in paragraph (j) of this section) of the life subgroup, as set 
off by the nonlife subgroup losses as provided in paragraph (m) of this 
section. The amount in this paragraph (g)(2) may not be less than zero.
    (3) Surplus accounts. The sum of the amounts subtracted under 
section 815 from the policyholders' surplus accounts of the life 
members.
    (h) Nonlife consolidated taxable income--(1) In general. Nonlife 
consolidated taxable income is the consolidated taxable income of the 
nonlife subgroup, computed under Sec. 1.1502-11 as modified by this 
paragraph (h). For this purpose, separate taxable income of a member 
includes separate mutual insurance company taxable income (as defined in 
section 821(b)) and insurance company taxable income (as defined in 
section 832).
    (2) Nonlife consolidated net operating loss deduction--(i) In 
general. In applying Sec. Sec. 1.1502-21 or 1.1502-21A (as 
appropriate), the rules in this subparagraph (2) apply in determining 
for the nonlife subgroup the nonlife net operating loss and the portion 
of the nonlife net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks to the 
taxable year.
    (ii) Nonlife CNOL. The nonlife consolidated net operating loss is 
determined under Sec. Sec. 1.1502-21(A)(f) or 1.1502-21(e) (as 
appropriate) by treating the nonlife subgroup as the group.
    (iii) Carryback. The nonlife consolidated net operating loss for the 
nonlife subgroup is carried back under Sec. Sec. 1.1502-21A or 1.1502-
21 (as appropriate) to the appropriate years (whether consolidated or 
separate) before the loss may be used as a nonlife subgroup loss under 
paragraphs (g)(2) and (m) of this section to set off consolidated 
partial LICTI in the year the loss arose. The election under section 
172(b)(3)(C) to relinquish the entire carryback period for the net 
operating loss of the nonlife subgroup may be made by the common parent 
of the group. Furthermore, the election may be made even though the 
election under section 812(b)(3) and paragraph (l)(3)(iii) of this 
section is not made.
    (iv) Subgroup rule. In determining the portion of the nonlife 
consolidated net operating loss that is absorbed when the loss is 
carried back to a consolidated return year beginning after December 31, 
1981, Sec. Sec. 1.1502-21A or 1.1502-21 (as appropriate) is applied by 
treating the nonlife subgroup as the group. Therefore, the absorption is 
determined without taking into account any life subgroup losses that 
were previously reported on a consolidated return as setting off nonlife 
consolidated taxable income for the year to which the nonlife loss is 
carried back.
    (v) Carryover. The portion of the nonlife consolidated net operating 
loss that is not absorbed in a prior year as a carryback, or as a 
nonlife subgroup loss that set off consolidated partial LICTI for the 
year the loss arose, constitutes a nonlife carryover under this 
subparagraph (2) to reduce nonlife consolidated taxable income before 
that portion may constitute a nonlife subgroup loss that sets off 
consolidated partial LICTI for a particular year.
    (vi) Transitional rules. The nonlife consolidated net operating loss 
deduction is subject to a transitional rule

[[Page 442]]

limitation in paragraph (h)(3) of this section.
    (vii) Example. The following example illustrates this paragraph 
(h)(2). In the example, L indicates a life company, another letter 
indicates a nonlife company, and each corporation uses the calendar year 
as its taxable year.

    Example. P owns all of the stock of S and L<INF>1</INF>. 
L<INF>1</INF> owns all of the stock of L<INF>2</INF>. For 1982, the 
group first files a consolidated return for which the election under 
section 1504(c)(2) is effective. P and S filed consolidated returns for 
1979 through 1981. In 1982, the P-S group sustains a nonlife 
consolidated net operating loss. The loss is carried back to the 
consolidated return years 1979, 1980, and 1981 of P and S by using the 
principles of Sec. Sec. 1.1502-21A and 1.1502-79A and, because the 
election in 1982 under section 1504(c)(2) does not result under 
paragraph (f)(1) of this section in the creation of a new group or the 
termination of the P-S nonlife group, the loss is absorbed on the 
consolidated return in those years without regard to whether the loss in 
1982 is attributable to P or S and without regard to their contribution 
to consolidated taxable income in 1979, 1980, or 1981. The portion of 
the loss not absorbed in 1979, 1980, and 1981 may serve as a nonlife 
subgroup loss in 1982 that may set off the consolidated partial LICTI of 
L<INF>1</INF> and L<INF>2</INF> under paragraphs (g)(2) and (m) of this 
section.

    (3) Transitional rule--(i) In general. The portion of the nonlife 
consolidated net operating loss deduction in a consolidated return year 
beginning after December 31, 1980 (referred to as ``post-1980 year'') 
attributable to net operating losses sustained in separate return years 
ending before January 1, 1981 (referred to as ``pre-1981 year''), is 
subject to the rules and limitations in this subparagraph (3).
    (ii) Separate nonlife groups. To determine the limitation, first, 
identify for the post-1980 year one or more separate affiliated groups 
of nonlife companies (as defined in section 1504 without section 
1504(c)(2)). For this purpose, a single nonlife company may constitute a 
separate affiliated group if (A) it is not otherwise a member of a 
separate group or (B) it has a net operating loss sustained in the pre-
1981 year that may be carried over and that year is a separate return 
limitation year (determined under Sec. 1.1502-1(f) without paragraph 
(d)(11) of this section).
    (iii) Carryover. Second, identify the pre-1981 year net operating 
losses that may be carried over and that are attributable to each 
separate affiliated group of nonlife companies. The separate return 
limitation year rules in Sec. Sec. 1.1502-21A(c) or 1.1502-21(c) (as 
appropriate) do not apply to any of these carryovers.
    (iv) Limitation. Third, treat the last taxable year ending before 
January 1, 1981, as if in that year there was a consolidated return 
change of ownership of each such separate affiliated group of nonlife 
companies and apply the consolidated return change of ownership 
limitation in Sec. 1.1502-21A(d) to the losses of each group by 
treating the members of each separate group as old members.
    (v) Examples. The following examples illustrate this paragraph 
(h)(3). In the examples L indicates a life company, another letter 
indicates a nonlife company, and each corporation uses the calendar year 
as its taxable year.

    Example (1). Throughout all of 1982, P owns all of the stock of S 
and L<INF>1</INF> and L<INF>1</INF> owns all of the stock of 
L<INF>2</INF> which in turn owns all of the stock of S<INF>1</INF>. 
Thus, for 1982, there are two nonlife subgroups under this subparagraph 
(3), P-S and S<INF>1</INF>. For 1981, P and S did not file a 
consolidated return and for 1980 P has a net operating loss of $200,000. 
Assume that P had no income in 1981. For 1982, the group makes an 
election under section 1504(c)(2) to file a consolidated return and all 
corporations are eligible corporations. The consolidated taxable income 
for the nonlife subgroup for 1982 (determined without the consolidated 
net operating loss deduction) recomputed by including only items of 
income and deduction of P and S is $120,000. If $120,000 is the Sec. 
1.1502-21(d)(2) amount for P and S, then the amount of P's net operating 
loss for 1980 that may be carried over to P and S for 1982 cannot exceed 
$120,000.
    Example (2). (a) P owns all of the stock of S<INF>1</INF>. On 
January 1, 1979, P purchased all of the stock of L<INF>1</INF> which 
owns all of the stock of L<INF>2</INF> and S<INF>2</INF>. Prior to 1984, 
all of the corporations filed separate returns. For 1984, the group 
makes an election under section 1504(c)(2) to file a consolidated 
return.
    (b) 1981, 1982, and 1983 are not treated under paragraph (d)(11) of 
this section as separate return limitation years of the P, 
S<INF>1</INF>, and S<INF>2</INF> nonlife subgroup. However, P and 
S<INF>1</INF> will be treated as old members under paragraph (h)(3)(iv) 
of this section and under Sec. 1.1502-21A(d) with respect to their 
losses in 1979 and 1980 (whether a consolidated return was filed or 
separate returns were filed) so that the portion of nonlife consolidated 
taxable income attributable to S<INF>2</INF> may not absorb the

[[Page 443]]

losses of P or S<INF>1</INF>. The rules that apply to the P-
S<INF>1</INF> nonlife subgroup for 1979 and 1980 apply in an identical 
way to S<INF>2</INF> by treating S<INF>2</INF> as a subgroup separate 
from the P-S<INF>1</INF> nonlife subgroup. See section 1507(c)(2)(A) of 
the Tax Reform Act of 1976.
    (c) Similarly, L<INF>1</INF> and L<INF>2</INF> are treated as old 
members under paragraphs (l)(3) and (h)(3)(iv) of this section for 
losses arising in 1979 and 1980. However, since the L<INF>1</INF>--
L<INF>2</INF> subgroup is also the life subgroup under paragraph (d)(8) 
of this section, the limitation in paragraph (h)(3)(iv) of this section 
does not affect the computation of consolidated partial LICTI for the 
life subgroup.

    (4) Nonlife consolidated capital gain net income or loss--(i) In 
general. In applying Sec. Sec. 1.1502-22 or 1.1502-22A (as 
appropriate),the rules in this subparagraph (4) apply in determining for 
the nonlife subgroup the nonlife consolidated capital gain net income or 
loss and the portion of the nonlife net capital loss carryovers and 
carrybacks to the taxable year. In particular, the nonlife consolidated 
capital gain net income and nonlife consolidated net capital loss are 
determined under the principles of Sec. Sec. 1.1502-22 or 1.1502-
22A(a) (as appropriate) by treating the nonlife subgroup as the group.
    (ii) Additional principles. In applying Sec. Sec. 1.1502-22A or 
1.1502-22 to nonlife consolidated net capital loss carryovers and 
carrybacks, the principles set forth in paragraphs (h)(2) (iii) through 
(v) for applying Sec. Sec. 1.1502-21 or 1.1502-21A (as appropriate) to 
nonlife consolidated net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks shall 
also apply. Further, the portion of nonlife consolidated net capital 
loss carryovers attributable to losses sustained in taxable years ending 
before January 1, 1981, is subject to the limitations in paragraph 
(h)(3) of this section applied by substituting ``net capital loss'' for 
the term ``net operating loss'' and ``Sec. 1.1502-22A(d)'' for ``Sec. 
1.1502-21A(d)''.
    (iii) Special rules. The nonlife consolidated net capital loss is 
reduced, for purposes of determining the carryovers and carrybacks under 
Sec. Sec. 1.1502-22A(b)(1) or 1.1502-22(b) by the lesser of:
    (A) The aggregate of the additional capital loss deductions allowed 
under section 822(c)(6) or section 832(c)(5), or
    (B) The nonlife consolidated taxable income computed without capital 
gains and losses.
    (i) [Reserved]
    (j) Consolidated partial LICTI. [Reserved]
    (k) Consolidated TII--(1) General rule. [Reserved]
    (2) Separate TII. [Reserved]
    (3) Company's share of investment yield. [Reserved]
    (4) Life consolidated capital gain net income. [Reserved]
    (5) Life consolidated net capital loss carryovers and carrybacks. 
The life consolidated net capital loss carryovers and carrybacks for the 
life subgroup are determined by applying the principles of Sec. Sec. 
1.1502-22 or 1.1502-22A (as appropriate) as modified by the following 
rules in this subparagraph (5):
    (i) Life consolidated net capital loss is first carried back (or 
apportioned to the life members for separate return years) to be 
absorbed by life consolidated capital gain net income without regard to 
any nonlife subgroup capital losses and before the life consolidated net 
capital loss may serve as a life subgroup capital loss that sets off 
nonlife consolidated capital gain net income in the year the life 
consolidated net capital loss arose.
    (ii) If a life consolidated net capital loss is not carried back or 
is not a life subgroup loss that sets off nonlife consolidated capital 
gain net income in the year the life consolidated net capital loss 
arose, then it is carried over to the particular year under this 
paragraph (k)(5) first against life consolidated capital gain net income 
before it may serve as a life subgroup capital loss that sets off 
nonlife consolidated capital gain net income in that particular year.
    (iii) Section 818(f). Capital losses may not be deducted more than 
once and capital gain will not be included more than once. See section 
818(e) and also section 818(f).
    (iv) Capital loss carryovers are subject to the transitional rule in 
paragraph (k)(6) of this section.
    (6) Transitional rule. The portion of the life consolidated capital 
loss carryovers attributable to the net capital losses of the life 
members sustained in separate return years ending before January 1, 
1981, is subject to the same limitations as the capital losses of 
nonlife members in paragraph

[[Page 444]]

(h)(4)(iii) of this section by applying the principles of paragraph 
(h)(3) of this section to each separate affiliated group of life 
companies.
    (l) Consolidated GO or LO--(1) General rule. [Reserved]
    (2) Separate GO. [Reserved]
    (3) Consolidated operations loss deduction--(i) General rule. The 
consolidated operations loss deduction is an amount equal to the 
consolidated operations loss carryovers and carrybacks to the taxable 
year. The provisions of Sec. Sec. 1.1502-21 or 1.1502-21A (as 
appropriate) and section 812 apply to the extent not inconsistent with 
this paragraph (l)(3).
    (ii) Consolidated offset. For purposes of applying section 812 (b) 
and (d), the term ``consolidated offset'' means the increase in the 
consolidated operations loss deduction which reduces consolidated 
partial LICTI to zero. For setoff of consolidated LO against nonlife 
consolidated taxable income, see paragraph (n)(2) of this section.
    (iii) Carrybacks. A consolidated LO is first carried back to be 
absorbed by GO of a life member under section 809(d)(4) or consolidated 
partial LICTI (as the case may be under section 818(f)(2)) for prior 
consolidated return years (or apportioned to the life members for prior 
separate return years) without regard to any nonlife subgroup losses 
that were set off against consolidated partial LICTI and before the 
consolidated LO may serve as a life subgroup loss to be set off against 
nonlife consolidated taxable income in the year the consolidated LO 
arose. The election to relinquish the entire carryback period for the 
consolidated LO of the life subgroup may be made by the common parent of 
the group. See section 812(b)(3). Furthermore, the election may be made 
even though the election under section 172(b)(3)(C) and paragraph 
(h)(2)(iii) of this section is not made.
    (iv) Carryovers. If a consolidated LO is not carried back or is not 
applied as a life subgroup loss that set off nonlife consolidated 
taxable income in the year the consolidated LO arose, then it is carried 
over to a particular year under this paragraph (l)(3) first against the 
GO of a life member under section 809(d)(4) or consolidated partial 
LICTI (as the case may be under section 818(f)(2)) before it may serve 
as a life subgroup loss that may be set off against nonlife consolidated 
taxable income for that particular year.
    (v) Transitional rule. The portion of a consolidated operations loss 
deduction that is attributable to LOs sustained in separate return years 
ending before January 1, 1981, is subject to the same rules and 
limitations that the nonlife consolidated net operating loss deduction 
is subject to in paragraph (h)(3) of this section as applied by 
identifying separate affiliated groups of life companies.
    (4) Life consolidated capital gain net income or loss. Life 
consolidated capital gain net income or loss is determined in the same 
manner as under paragraph (k)(4) of this section. However, a life 
member's company share is determined under section 809 (a) and (b)(3).
    (m) Consolidated partial LICTI setoff by nonlife subgroup losses--
(1) In general. The nonlife subgroup losses consist of the nonlife 
consolidated net operating loss and the nonlife consolidated net capital 
loss. Under paragraph (g)(2) of this section, consolidated partial LICTI 
is set off by the amounts of these two consolidated losses specified in 
paragraph (m)(2) of this section. The setoff is subject to the rules and 
limitations in paragraph (m)(3) of this section.
    (2) Amount of setoff--(i) Current year. Consolidated partial LICTI 
for the current taxable year is set off by the portion of the nonlife 
consolidated net operating loss and nonlife consolidated net capital 
loss arising in that year that cannot be carried back under paragraph 
(h) of this section to prior taxable years (whether consolidated or 
separate return years) of the nonlife subgroup.
    (ii) Carryovers. The portion of the offsettable nonlife consolidated 
net operating loss or nonlife consolidated net capital loss that has not 
been used as a nonlife subgroup loss setoff against consolidated partial 
LICTI in the year it arose may be carried over to succeeding taxable 
years under the principles of Sec. Sec. 1.1502-21 or 1.1502-21A (as 
appropriate) (relating to net operating loss deduction) or Sec. Sec. 
1.1502-22 or 1.1502-22A (as appropriate) (relating to net capital loss 
carryovers). However, in

[[Page 445]]

any particular succeeding year, the losses will be used under paragraph 
(h) of this section in computing nonlife consolidated taxable income 
before being used in that year as a nonlife subgroup loss that sets off 
consolidated partial LICTI.
    (3) Nonlife subgroup loss rules and limitations. The nonlife 
subgroup losses are subject to the following operating rules and 
limitations:
    (i) Separate return years. The carryovers in paragraph (m)(2)(ii) of 
this section may include net operating losses and net capital losses of 
the nonlife members arising in separate return years ending after 
December 31, 1980, that may be carried over to a succeeding year under 
the principles (including limitations) of Sec. Sec. 1.1502-21 and 
1.1502-22 (or Sec. Sec. 1.1502-21A and 1.1502-22A, as appropriate). 
But see subdivision (ix) of this paragraph (m)(3).
    (ii) Capital loss. Nonlife consolidated net capital loss sets off 
consolidated partial LICTI only to the extent of life consolidated 
capital gain net income (as determined under paragraph (l)(4) of this 
section) and this setoff applies before any nonlife consolidated net 
operating loss sets off consolidated partial LICTI.
    (iii) Capital gain. Life consolidated capital gain net income is 
zero in any taxable year in which the life subgroup has a consolidated 
LO and, in any taxable year, it may not exceed consolidated partial 
LICTI.
    (iv) Ordering rule. Consolidated partial LICTI for a consolidated 
return year is set off by nonlife subgroup losses for that year before 
being set off (under paragraph (m)(2)(ii) of this section) by a 
carryover of a nonlife subgroup loss to that year.
    (v) Setoff at bottom line. The setoff of nonlife subgroup losses 
against consolidated partial LICTI does not affect life member 
deductions that depend in whole or in part on GO or TII. Thus, the 
setoff does not affect the amount of consolidated partial LICTI (as 
determined under paragraph (j) of this section) for any taxable year but 
it merely constitutes an adjustment in arriving at the group's 
consolidated taxable income under paragraph (g) of this section.
    (vi) Ineligible nonlife member. (A) The offsetable nonlife 
consolidated net operating loss that arises in any consolidated return 
year (that may be set off against consolidated partial LICTI in the 
current taxable year or in a succeeding taxable year) is the amount 
computed under paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section reduced by the 
ineligible NOL. For purposes of this subparagraph (3), the ``ineligible 
NOL'' is in the year the loss arose the amount of the separate net 
operating loss (determined under Sec. Sec. 1.1502-21(b) of any nonlife 
member that is ineligible in that year (and not the portion of the 
nonlife consolidated net operating loss attributable under Sec. Sec. 
1.1502-21(b) to such a member). (B) The carryovers of offsetable nonlife 
net operating losses under paragraph (m)(2)(ii) of this section do not 
include an ineligible NOL arising in a consolidated return year or a 
loss attributable to an ineligible member arising in a separate return 
year. See section 1503(c)(2). (C) For absorption within the nonlife 
subgroup of an ineligible NOL arising in a consolidated return year or a 
loss of an ineligible member arising in a separate return year which is 
not a separate return limitation year under paragraph (m)(3)(ix) of this 
section, see paragraph (m)(3)(vii) of this section.
    (vii) Absorption of ineligible NOL. (A) If all or a portion of a 
nonlife member's ineligible NOL (determined under paragraph 
(m)(3)(vi)(A) of this section) may be carried back or carried over under 
paragraph (h)(2) of this section to a particular consolidated return 
year of the nonlife subgroup (absorption year), then notwithstanding 
Sec. 1.1502-21A(b)(3)(ii) or 1.1502-21(b), the amount carried to the 
absorption year will be absorbed by that member's contribution (to the 
extent thereof) to nonlife consolidated taxable income for that year.
    (B) For purposes of (A) of this subdivision (vii), a member's 
contribution to nonlife consolidated taxable income for an absorption 
year is the amount of such income (computed without the portion of the 
nonlife consolidated net operating loss deduction attributable to 
taxable years subsequent to the year the loss arose), minus such 
consolidated taxable income recomputed by

[[Page 446]]

excluding both that member's items of income and deductions for the 
absorption year. The deductions of the member include the prior 
application of this paragraph (m)(3)(vii) to the absorption of the 
nonlife consolidated net operating loss deduction for losses arising in 
taxable years prior to the particular loss year.
    (viii) Election to relinquish carryback. The offsetable nonlife 
consolidated net operating loss does not include the amount that could 
be carried back under paragraph (h) (2) of this section but for the 
common parent's election under section 172(b)(3)(C) to relinquish the 
carryback. See section 1503(c)(1).
    (ix) Separate return limitation year. The offsetable nonlife 
consolidated net operating and capital loss carryovers do not include 
any losses attributable to a nonlife member that were sustained (A) in a 
separate return limitation year (determined without section 1504(b)(2)) 
of that member (or a predecessor), or (B) in a separate return year 
ending after December 31, 1980, in which an election was in effect under 
neither section 1504(c)(2) nor section 243(b)(2). For purposes of this 
paragraph (m), a separate return limitation year includes a taxable year 
ending before January 1, 1981. See section 1507(c)(2)(A) of the Tax 
Reform Act of 1976 and Sec. Sec. 1.1502-15 and 1.1502-15A (including 
applicable exceptions thereto).
    (x) Percentage limitation. The offsetable nonlife consolidated net 
operating losses that may be set off against consolidated partial LICTI 
in a particular year may not exceed a percentage limitation. This 
limitation is the applicable percentage in section 1503(c)(1) of the 
lesser of two amounts.

The first amount is the sum of the offsetable nonlife consolidated net 
operating losses under paragraph (m)(2) of this section that may serve 
in the particular year (determined without this limitation) as a setoff 
against consolidated partial LICTI. The second amount is consolidated 
partial LICTI (as defined in paragraph (j) of this section) in the 
particular year reduced by any nonlife consolidated net capital loss 
that sets off consolidated partial LICTI in that year.
    (xi) Further limitation. Any offsetable nonlife consolidated net 
operating loss remaining after applying the percentage limitation that 
is carried over to a succeeding taxable year may not be set off against 
the consolidated partial LICTI attributable to a life member that was 
not an eligible life member in the year the loss arose. See section 
1503(c)(2).
    (xii) Restoration rule. The carryback of a consolidated LO or life 
consolidated net capital loss under paragraph (l) of this section that 
reduces consolidated partial LICTI (or life consolidated capital gain 
net income) for a prior year may reduce the amount of nonlife subgroup 
losses that would offset consolidated partial LICTI in that prior year. 
Thus, that amount may be carried over under paragraph (h) (2) or (4) of 
this section from that prior year in determining nonlife consolidated 
taxable income in a succeeding year or serve as offsetable nonlife 
subgroup losses in a succeeding year.
    (4) Acquired groups. [Reserved]
    (5) Illustrations. The following examples illustrates this paragraph 
(m). In the examples, L indicates a life company, another letter 
indicates a nonlife company, and each corporation uses the calendar year 
as its taxable year.

    Example (1). P owns all of the stock of L and S. S owns all of the 
stock of I, a nonlife member that is an ineligible corporation for 1982 
under paragraph (d)(13) of this section. For 1982, the group elects 
under section 1504(c)(2) to file a consolidated return. For 1982, assume 
that any nonlife consolidated net operating loss may not be carried back 
to a prior taxable year. Other facts are summarized in the following 
table.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Nonlife consolidated net operating loss..................      (100)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Under paragraph (m)(3)(vi) of this section, P's separate income is 
considered to absorb the loss of S, an eligible member, first and the 
offsetable nonlife consolidated net operating loss is zero, i.e., the 
consolidated net operating loss ($100) reduced by I's loss ($100). The 
consolidated net operating loss ($100) may be carried over, but since it 
is entirely attributable to I (an ineligible member) its use is subject 
to the restrictions in paragraph (m)(3)(vi) of this section. The result

[[Page 447]]

would be the same if the group contained two additional members, 
S<INF>1</INF>, an eligible member, and I<INF>1</INF>, an ineligible 
member, where S<INF>1</INF> had a loss of ($100) and I<INF>1</INF> had 
income of $100.
    Example (2). The facts are the same as in example (1) except that 
for 1982 S's separate net operating loss is $200. Assume further that 
L's consolidated partial LICTI is $200. Under paragraph (m)(3)(vi) of 
this section, the offsetable nonlife consolidated net operating loss is 
$100, i.e., the nonlife consolidated net operating loss computed under 
paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section ($200), reduced by the separate net 
operating loss of I ($100). The offsetable nonlife consolidated net 
operating loss that may be set off against consolidated partial LICTI in 
1982 is $30, i.e., 30 percent of the lesser of the offsetable $100 or 
consolidated partial LICTI of $200. See paragraph (m)(3)(x) of this 
section. The nonlife subgroup may carry $170 to 1983 under paragraph 
(h)(2) of this section against nonlife consolidated taxable income, 
i.e., consolidated net operating loss ($200) less amount used in 1982 
($30). Under paragraph (m)(2)(ii) of this section, the offsetable 
nonlife consolidated net operating loss that may be carried to 1983 is 
$70, i.e., $100 minus $30. The facts and results are summarized in the 
table below.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                           (Dollars omitted)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Accordingly, under paragrah (g) of this section (assuming no amount is 
withdrawn from L's surplus accounts), consolidated taxable income is 
$170, i.e., line 5 (a) minus line 6(c)).
    Example (3). The facts are the same as in example (2) with the 
following additions for 1983. The nonlife subgroup has nonlife 
consolidated taxable income of $50 (all of which is attributable to I) 
before the nonlife consolidated net operating loss deduction under 
paragraph (h)(2) of this section. Consolidated partial LICTI is $100. 
Under paragraph (h)(2) of this section, $50 of the nonlife consolidated 
net operating loss carryover ($170) is used in 1983 and, under paragraph 
(m)(3) (vi) and (vii) of this section, the portion used in 1982 is 
attributable to I, the ineligible nonlife member. Accordingly, the 
offsetable nonlife consolidated net operating loss from 1982 under 
paragraph (m)(3)(ii) of this section is $70, i.e., the unused loss from 
1982. The offsetable nonlife consolidated net operating loss in 1983 is 
$24.50, i.e., 35 percent of the lesser of the offsetable loss of $70 or 
consolidated partial LICTI of $100. Accordingly, under paragraph (g) of 
this section (assuming no amount is withdrawn from L's surplus 
accounts), consolidated taxable income is $75.50, i.e., consolidated 
partial LICTI of $100 minus the offsetable loss of $24.50.
    Example (4). P owns all of the stock of S and L. For 1982, all 
corporations are eligible corporations, and the group elects under 
section 1504(c)(2) to file a consolidated return, the nonlife 
consolidated net operating loss is $100, and the nonlife consolidated 
net capital loss is $50. Assume that the losses may not be carried back 
and the capital losses are not attributable to built-in deductions under 
paragraph (m)(3)(ix) of this section or under Sec. 1.1502-15A. Other 
facts and the results are set forth in the following table:

------------------------------------------------------------------------


Accordingly, under paragraph (g) of this section consolidated taxable 
income is $35, i.e., line 3 minus line 5(c).
    Example (5). The facts are the same as in example (4). Assume 
further that for 1983 L has an LO that is carried back to 1982 and the 
LO is large enough to reduce consolidated partial LICTI for 1982 to zero 
as determined before any setoff for nonlife losses. Under paragraph 
(m)(3)(xii) of this section, the nonlife consolidated net operating loss 
of $15 and the nonlife consolidated net capital

[[Page 448]]

loss of $50 that were set off in 1982 respectively against consolidated 
partial LICTI and life consolidated capital gain net income are 
restored. These restored amounts may consititute part of the nonlife 
consolidated net operating loss carryover to 1983 under paragraph (h)(2) 
of this section or part of the nonlife net capital loss carryover to 
1983 under paragraph (h)(4) of this section.
    Example (6). The facts are the same as in example (5) except that 
L's LO for 1983 as carried back reduces consolidated partial LICTI in 
1982 from $100 to $25. Since consolidated partial LICTI of $100 in 1982 
(before the carryback) included life consolidated capital gain net 
income of $50, under paragraph (m)(3)(iii) of this section, the life 
consolidated capital gain net income is $25, i.e., $50 but not more than 
$25. Therefore, under paragraph (m)(3)(ii) of this section, the 
offsetable nonlife capital loss in 1982 is $25 and, under paragraph (m) 
(3)(xii) of this section, $25 of the $50 nonlife consolidated net 
capital loss in 1982 may be carried under paragraph (h)(4) of this 
section to 1983. No nonlife consolidated net operating loss is used as a 
setoff against consolidated partial LICTI in 1982 under paragraph 
(m)(3)(xii) of this section by reason of the carryback of the 
consolidated LO from 1983 to 1982.

    (n) Nonlife consolidated taxable income set off by life subgroup 
losses--(1) In general. The life subgroup losses consist of the 
consolidated LO and the life consolidated net capital loss (as 
determined under paragraph (l)(4) of this section). Under paragraph 
(g)(1) of this section, nonlife consolidated taxable income is set off 
by the amounts of these two consolidated losses specified in paragraph 
(n)(2) of this section.
    (2) Amount of setoff. The portion of the consolidated LO or life 
consolidated net capital loss that may be set off against nonlife 
consolidated taxable income (determined under paragraph (h) of this 
section) is determined by applying the rules prescribed in paragraphs 
(m) (2) and (3) of this section in the following manner:
    (i) Substitute the term ``life'' for ``nonlife'', and vice versa.
    (ii) Substitute the term ``nonlife consolidated taxable income'' for 
``consolidated partial LICTI'', and vice versa.
    (iii) Substitute the term ``consolidated LO'' for ``non-life 
consolidated net operating loss'', ``paragraph (l)'' or ``paragraph 
(j)'' for ``paragraph (h)'', and ``section 812(b)(3)'' for ``section 
172(b)(3)(C)''.
    (iv) Paragraphs (m)(3)(vi), (vii), (x), and (xi) of this section do 
not apply to a consolidated LO.
    (v) Capital losses may not be deducted more than once. See section 
818(e) and also the requirements in section 818(f).
    (vi) The setoff of life subgroup losses against nonlife consolidated 
taxable income does not affect nonlife member deductions that depend in 
whole or in part on taxable income.
    (3) Illustrations. The following examples illustrate this paragraph 
(n). In the examples, L indicates a life company, another letter 
indicates a nonlife company, and each corporation uses the calendar year 
as its taxable year.

    Example (1). P, S, L<INF>1</INF> and L<INF>2</INF> constitute a 
group that elects under section 1504(c)(2) to file a consolidated return 
for 1982. In 1982, the nonlife subgroup consolidated taxable income is 
$100 and there is $20 of nonlife consolidated net capital loss that 
cannot be carried back under paragraph (h) of this section to taxable 
years (whether consolidated or separate) preceding 1982. The nonlife 
subgroup has no carryover from years prior to 1982. Consolidated LO is 
$150 which under paragraph (l) of this section includes life 
consolidated capital gain net income of $25. The $150 LO is carried back 
under paragraph (l)(3) of this section to taxable years (whether 
consolidated or separate) preceding 1982 before it may offset in 1982 
nonlife consolidated taxable income. Since life consolidated capital 
gain net income is zero for 1982, the nonlife capital loss offset is 
zero.
    Example (2). The facts are the same as in example (1). Assume 
further that no part of the $150 consolidated LO for 1982 can be used by 
L<INF>1</INF> and L<INF>2</INF> in years prior to 1982. For 1982, $100 
of consolidated LO sets off the $100 nonlife consolidated taxable 
income. The life subgroup carries under paragraph (l)(3) of this section 
to 1983 $50 of the consolidated LO ($150 minus $100). See paragraph 
(l)(3)(ii) of this section. The $50 carryover will be used in 1983 
against life subgroup income before it may be used in 1983 to setoff 
nonlife consolidated taxable income.
    Example (3). (a) The facts are the same as in example (1), except 
that for 1982 the nonlife consolidated taxable income is $150 and 
includes nonlife consolidated capital gain net income of $50, 
consolidated partial LICTI is $200, and a life consolidated net capital 
loss is $50. Assume that the $50 life consolidated net capital loss sets 
off the $50 nonlife consolidated capital gain net income. Consolidated 
taxable income under paragraph (g) of this section is $300, i.e., 
nonlife consolidated taxable income ($150) minus the

[[Page 449]]

setoff of the life consolidated net capital loss ($50), plus 
consolidated partial LICTI ($200).
    (b) Assume that for 1983 the nonlife consolidated net operating loss 
is $150. Under paragraph (h)(2) of this section, the loss may be carried 
back to 1982 against nonlife consolidated taxable income. If P, the 
common parent, does not elect to relinquish the carryback under section 
172(b)(3)(C), the entire $150 must be carried back reducing 1982 nonlife 
consolidated taxable income to zero and nonlife consolidated capital 
gain net income to zero. Under paragraph (m)(3)(xii) of this section, 
the setoff in 1982 of the nonlife consolidated capital gain net income 
($50) by the life consolidated net capital loss ($50) is restored. 
Accordingly, the 1982 life consolidated net capital loss may be carried 
over by the life subgroup to 1983. Under paragraph (g) of this section, 
after the carryback consolidated taxable income for 1982 is $200, i.e., 
nonlife consolidated taxable income ($0) plus consolidated partial LICTI 
($200).
    Example (4). The facts are the same as in example (3), except that P 
elects under section 172 (b)(3)(C) to relinquish the carryback of $150 
arising in 1983. The setoff in part (a) of example (3) is not restored. 
However, the offsetable nonlife consolidated net operating loss for 1983 
(or that may be carried forward from 1983) is zero. See paragraph 
(m)(3)(viii) of this section. Nevertheless, the $150 nonlife 
consolidated net operating loss may be carried forward to be used by the 
nonlife group.
    Example (5). P owns all of the stock of S<INF>1</INF> and of 
L<INF>1.</INF> On January 1, 1978, L<INF>1</INF> purchases all of the 
stock of L<INF>2.</INF> For 1982, the group elects under section 
1504(c)(2) to file a consolidated return. For 1982, L<INF>1</INF> is an 
eligible corporation under paragraph (d)(12) of this section but 
L<INF>2</INF> is ineligible. Thus, L<INF>1</INF> but not L<INF>2</INF> 
is a member for 1982. For 1982, L<INF>2</INF> sustains an LO that cannot 
be carried back. For 1982, L<INF>2</INF> is treated under paragraph 
(f)(6) of this section as a member of a controlled group of corporations 
under section 1563 with P, S, and L<INF>1.</INF> For 1983, L<INF>2</INF> 
is eligible and is included on the group's consolidated return. 
L<INF>2</INF>'s LO for 1982 that may be carried to 1983 is not treated 
under paragraph (d)(11) of this section as having been sustained in a 
separate return limitation year for purposes of computing consolidated 
partial LICTI of the L<INF>1</INF>-L<INF>2</INF> life subgroup for 1983. 
Furthermore, the portion of L<INF>2</INF>'s LO not used under paragraph 
(l)(3) of this section against life subgroup income in 1983 may be 
included in offsetable consolidated operations loss under paragraph 
(n)(2) and (m)(3)(i) of this section that reduces in 1983 nonlife 
consolidated taxable income because L<INF>2</INF>'s loss in 1982 was not 
sustained in a separate return limitation year under paragraph (n)(2) 
and (m)(3)(ix)(A) of this section or in a separate return year (1982) 
when an election was in effect neither under section 1504(c)(2) nor 
section 243(b)(2).

    (o) Alternative tax--(1) In general. For purposes of the alternative 
tax under paragraph (f)(7)(ii) of this section, consolidated net capital 
gain is the sum of the following two amounts:
    (i) The nonlife consolidated net capital gain reduced by any setoff 
of a life consolidated net capital loss.
    (ii) The life consolidated net capital gain reduced by any setoff of 
a nonlife consolidated net capital loss.
    (2) Net capital gain. For purposes of this paragraph (o):
    (i) Nonlife consolidated net capital gain is computed under Sec. 
Sec. 1.1502-41A or 1.1502-22T (as appropriate) except that it may not 
exceed nonlife consolidated taxable income (computed under paragraph (h) 
of this section).
    (ii) Life consolidated net capital gain is computed under Sec. 
Sec. 1.1502-41A or 1.1502-22T (as appropriate), applied in a manner 
consistent with paragraph (l)(4) of this section, except that it may not 
exceed consolidated partial LICTI (as determined under paragraph (j) of 
this section).
    (iii) Setoffs. Setoffs are determined under paragraphs (m) or (n) of 
this section (as the case may be).
    (p) Transitional rule for credit carryovers. For limitations on 
credits arising in taxable years ending before January 1, 1981, that may 
be carried over to taxable years beginning on or after that date, 
section 1507(c)(2)(A) of the Tax Reform Act of 1976 and the principles 
in paragraph (h)(3) of this section (relating to limitations on loss 
carryovers) apply.
    (q) Preemption. The rules in this section preempt any inconsistent 
rules in other sections (Sec. 1.1502-1 through 1.1502-80) of the 
consolidated return regulations. For example, the rules in paragraph 
(m)(3)(vi) apply notwithstanding Sec. Sec. 1.1502-21A(b)(3) and 1.1502-
79A(a)(3) (or Sec. 1.1502-21, as appropriate).
    (r) Other consolidation principles. The fact that this section 
treats the life and nonlife members as separate groups in computing, 
respectively, consolidated partial LICTI (or LO) and nonlife 
consolidated taxable income (or loss) does not affect the usual rules in 
Sec. Sec. 1.1502-0--1.1502-80 unless this section provides otherwise. 
Thus, the usual rules in Sec. 1.1502-13 (relating to intercompany 
transactions) apply to both

[[Page 450]]

the life and nonlife members by treating them as members of one 
affiliated group.
    (s) Filing requirements. Nonlife consolidated taxable income or loss 
under paragraph (h) of this section shall be determined on a separate 
Form 1120 or 1120 M and consolidated partial LICTI under paragraph (j) 
of this section shall be determined on a separate Form 1120 L. The 
consolidated return shall be made on a separate Form 1120, 1120 M, or 
1120 L by the common parent (if the group includes a life company), 
which shows the set-offs under paragraphs (g), (m), and (n) of this 
section and clearly indicates by notation on the face of the return that 
it is a life-nonlife consolidated return (if the group includes a life 
company). See also Sec. 1.1502-75(j), relating to statements and 
schedules for subsidiaries.

Sec. 1.1502-55  Computation of alternative minimum tax of consolidated groups.

    (a)-(h)(3) [Reserved]
    (h)(4) Separate return year minimum tax credit. (i)-(ii) [Reserved]
    (iii)(A) Limitation on portion of separate return year minimum tax 
credit arising in separate return limitation years. The aggregate of a 
member's minimum tax credits arising in SRLYs that are included in the 
consolidated minimum tax credits for all consolidated return years of 
the group may not exceed--
    (1) The aggregate for all consolidated return years of the member's 
contributions to the consolidated section 53(c) limitation for each 
consolidated return year; reduced by
    (2) The aggregate of the member's minimum tax credits arising and 
absorbed in all consolidated return years (whether or not absorbed by 
the member).
    (B) Computational rules--(1) Member's contribution to the 
consolidated section 53(c) limitation. Except as provided in the special 
rule of paragraph (h)(4)(iii)(B)(2) of this section, a member's 
contribution to the consolidated section 53(c) limitation for a 
consolidated return year equals the member's share of the consolidated 
net regular tax liability minus its share of consolidated tentative 
minimum tax. The group computes the member's shares by applying to the 
respective consolidated amounts the principles of section 1552 and the 
percentage method under Sec. 1.1502-33(d)(3), assuming a 100% 
allocation of any decreased tax liability. The group makes proper 
adjustments so that taxes and credits not taken into account in 
computing the limitation under section 53(c) are not taken into account 
in computing the member's share of the consolidated net regular tax, 
etc. (See, for example, the taxes described in section 26(b) that are 
disregarded in computing regular tax liability.)
    (2) Adjustment for year in which alternative minimum tax is paid. 
For a consolidated return year for which consolidated tentative minimum 
tax is greater than consolidated regular tax liability, the group 
reduces the member's share of the consolidated tentative minimum tax by 
the member's share of the consolidated alternative minimum tax for the 
year. The group determines the member's share of consolidated 
alternative minimum tax for a year using the same method it uses to 
determine the member's share of the consolidated minimum tax credits for 
the year.
    (3) Years included in computation. For purposes of computing the 
limitation under this paragraph (h)(4)(iii), the consolidated return 
years of the group include only those years, including the year to which 
a credit is carried, that the member has been continuously included in 
the group's consolidated return, but exclude any years after the year to 
which the credit is carried.
    (4) Subgroup principles. The SRLY subgroup principles under Sec. 
1.1502-21(c)(2) apply for purposes of this paragraph (h)(4)(iii). The 
predecessor and successor principles under Sec. 1.1502-21(f) also apply 
for purposes of this paragraph (h)(4)(iii).

[[Page 451]]

    (5) Overlap with section 383. The principles under Sec. 1.1502-
21(g) apply for purposes of this paragraph (h)(4)(iii). For example, an 
overlap of this paragraph (h)(4)(iii) and the application of section 383 
with respect to a credit carryover occurs if a corporation becomes a 
member of a consolidated group (the SRLY event) within six months of the 
change date of an ownership change giving rise to a section 383 credit 
limitation with respect to that carryover (the section 383 event), with 
the result that the limitation of this paragraph (h)(4)(iii) does not 
apply. See Sec. Sec. 1.1502-21(g)(2)(ii)(A) and 1.383-1; see also Sec. 
1.1502-21(g)(4) (subgroup rules).
    (C) Effective date--(1) In general. This paragraph (h)(4)(iii) 
generally applies to consolidated return years for which the due date of 
the income tax return (without extensions) is after March 13, 1998. See 
Sec. 1.1502-3(d)(4) for an optional effective date rule (generally 
making this paragraph (h)(4)(iii) also applicable to a consolidated 
return year beginning on or after January 1, 1997, if the due date of 
the income tax return (without extensions) was on or before March 13, 
1998).
    (i) Contribution years. In general, a group does not take into 
account a consolidated taxable year for which the due date of the income 
tax return (without extensions) is on or before March 13, 1998, in 
determining a member's (or subgroup's) contributions to the consolidated 
section 53(c) limitation under this paragraph (h)(4)(iii). However, if a 
consolidated group chooses to apply the optional effective date rule, 
the consolidated group shall not take into account a consolidated 
taxable year beginning before January 1, 1997 in determining a member's 
(or subgroup's) contributions to the consolidated section 53(c) 
limitation under this paragraph (h)(4)(iii).
    (ii) Special subgroup rule. In the event that the principles of 
Sec. 1.1502-21(g)(1) do not apply to a particular credit carryover in 
the current group, then solely for purposes of applying this paragraph 
(h)(4)(iii) to determine the limitation with respect to that carryover 
and with respect to which the SRLY register (the aggregate of the 
member's or subgroup's contribution to consolidated section 53(c) 
limitation reduced by the aggregate of the member's or subgroup's 
minimum tax credits arising and absorbed in all consolidated return 
years) began in a taxable year for which the due date of the return is 
on or before May 25, 2000, the principles of Sec. 1.1502-21(c)(2) shall 
be applied without regard to the phrase ``or for a carryover that was 
subject to the overlap rule described in paragraph (g) of this section 
or Sec. 1.1502-15(g) with respect to another group (the former 
group).''
    (2) Overlap rule. Paragraph (h)(4)(iii)(B)(5) of this section 
(relating to overlap with section 383) applies to taxable years for 
which the due date (without extensions) of the consolidated return is 
after May 25, 2000. For purposes of paragraph (h)(4)(iii)(B)(5) of this 
section, only an ownership change to which section 383, as amended by 
the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (100 Stat. 2095), applies and which results 
in a section 383 credit limitation shall constitute a section 383 event. 
The optional effective date rule of Sec. 1.1502-3(d)(4) (generally 
making this paragraph (h)(4)(iii) also applicable to a consolidated 
return year beginning on or after January 1, 1997, if the due date of 
the income tax return (without extensions) was on or before March 13, 
1998) does not apply with respect to paragraph (h)(4)(iii)(B)(5) of this 
section (relating to the overlap rule).

[T.D. 8884, 65 FR 33759, May 25, 2000]

                Administrative Provisions and Other Rules


<R05>
Sec. 1.1502-75  Filing of consolidated returns.

    (a) Privilege of filing consolidated returns--(1) Exercise of 
privilege for first consolidated return year. A group which did not file 
a consolidated return for the immediately preceding taxable year may 
file a consolidated return in lieu of separate returns for the taxable 
year, provided that each corporation which has been a member during any 
part of the taxable year for which the consolidated return is to be 
filed consents (in the manner provided in paragraph (b) of this section) 
to the regulations under section 1502. If a group wishes to exercise its 
privilege of filing a consolidated return, such consolidated return must 
be filed not later

[[Page 452]]

than the last day prescribed by law (including extensions of time) for 
the filing of the common parent's return. Such consolidated return may 
not be withdrawn after such last day (but the group may change the basis 
of its return at any time prior to such last day).
    (2) Continued filing requirement. A group which filed (or was 
required to file) a consolidated return for the immediately preceding 
taxable year is required to file a consolidated return for the taxable 
year unless it has an election to discontinue filing consolidated 
returns under paragraph (c) of this section.
    (b) How consent for first consolidated year exercised--(1) General 
rule. The consent of a corporation referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section shall be made by such corporation joining in the making of 
the consolidated return for such year. A corporation shall be deemed to 
have joined in the making of such return for such year if it files a 
Form 1122 in the manner specified in paragraph (h)(2) of this section.
    (2) Consent under facts and circumstances. If a member of the group 
fails to file Form 1122, the Commissioner may under the facts and 
circumstances determine that such member has joined in the making of a 
consolidated return by such group. The following circumstances, among 
others, will be taken into account in making this determination:
    (i) Whether or not the income and deductions of the member were 
included in the consolidated return;
    (ii) Whether or not a separate return was filed by the member for 
that taxable year; and
    (iii) Whether or not the member was included in the affiliations 
schedule, Form 851.

If the Commissioner determines that the member has joined in the making 
of the consolidated return, such member shall be treated as if it had 
filed a Form 1122 for such year for purposes of paragraph (h)(2) of this 
section.
    (3) Failure to consent due to mistake. If any member has failed to 
join in the making of a consolidated return under either subparagraph 
(1) or (2) of this paragraph, then the tax liability of each member of 
the group shall be determined on the basis of separate returns unless 
the common parent corporation establishes to the satisfaction of the 
Commissioner that the failure of such member to join in the making of 
the consolidated return was due to a mistake of law or fact, or to 
inadvertence. In such case, such member shall be treated as if it had 
filed a Form 1122 for such year for purposes of paragraph (h)(2) of this 
section, and thus joined in the making of the consolidated return for 
such year.
    (c) Election to discontinue filing consolidated returns--(1) Good 
cause--(i) In general. Notwithstanding that a consolidated return is 
required for a taxable year, the Commissioner, upon application by the 
common parent, may for good cause shown grant permission to a group to 
discontinue filing consolidated returns. Any such application shall be 
made to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Washington, DC 20224, and 
shall be made not later than the 90th day before the due date for the 
filing of the consolidated return (including extensions of time). In 
addition, if an amendment of the Code, or other law affecting the 
computation of tax liability, is enacted and the enactment is effective 
for a taxable year ending before or within 90 days after the date of 
enactment, then application for such a taxable year may be made not 
later than the 180th day after the date of enactment, and if the 
application is approved the permission to discontinue filing 
consolidated returns will apply to such taxable year notwithstanding 
that a consolidated return has already been filed for such year.
    (ii) Substantial adverse change in law affecting tax liability. 
Ordinarily, the Commissioner will grant a group permission to 
discontinue filing consolidated returns if the net result of all 
amendments to the Code or regulations with effective dates commencing 
within the taxable year has a substantial adverse effect on the 
consolidated tax liability of the group for such year relative to what 
the aggregate tax liability would be if the members of the group filed 
separate returns for such year. Thus, for example, assume P and S filed 
a consolidated return for the

[[Page 453]]

calendar year 1966 and that the provisions of the Code have been amended 
by a bill which was enacted by Congress in 1966, but which is first 
effective for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 1967. 
Assume further that P makes a timely application to discontinue filing 
consolidated returns. In order to determine whether the amendments have 
a substantial adverse effect on the consolidated tax liability for 1967, 
relative to what the aggregate tax liability would be if the members of 
the group filed separate returns for 1967, the difference between the 
tax liability of the group computed on a consolidated basis and taking 
into account the changes in the law effective for 1967 and the aggregate 
tax liability of the members of the group computed as if each such 
member filed separate returns for such year (also taking into account 
such changes) shall be compared with the difference between the tax 
liability of such group for 1967 computed on a consolidated basis 
without regard to the changes in the law effective in such year and the 
aggregate tax liability of the members of the group computed as if 
separate returns had been filed by such members for such year without 
regard to the changes in the law effective in such year.
    (iii) Other factors. In addition, the Commissioner will take into 
account other factors in determining whether good cause exists for 
granting permission to discontinue filing consolidated returns beginning 
with the taxable year, including:
    (a) Changes in law or circumstances, including changes which do not 
affect Federal income tax liability,
    (b) Changes in law which are first effective in the taxable year and 
which result in a substantial reduction in the consolidated net 
operating loss (or consolidated unused investment credit) for such year 
relative to what the aggregate net operating losses (or investment 
credits) would be if the members of the group filed separate returns for 
such year, and
    (c) Changes in the Code or regulations which are effective prior to 
the taxable year but which first have a substantial adverse effect on 
the filing of a consolidated return relative to the filing of separate 
returns by members of the group in such year.
    (2) Discretion of Commissioner to grant blanket permission--(i) 
Permission to all groups. The Commissioner, in his discretion, may grant 
all groups permission to discontinue filing consolidated returns if any 
provision of the Code or regulations has been amended and such amendment 
is of the type which could have a substantial adverse effect on the 
filing of consolidated returns by substantially all groups, relative to 
the filing of separate returns. Ordinarily, the permission to 
discontinue shall apply with respect to the taxable year of each group 
which includes the effective date of such an amendment.
    (ii) Permission to a class of groups. The Commissioner, in his 
discretion, may grant a particular class of groups permission to 
discontinue filing consolidated returns if any provision of the Code or 
regulations has been amended and such amendment is of the type which 
could have a substantial adverse effect on the filing of consolidated 
returns by substantially all such groups relative to the filing of 
separate returns. Ordinarily, the permission to discontinue shall apply 
with respect to the taxable year of each group within the class which 
includes the effective date of such an amendment.
    (3) Time and manner for exercising election. If, under subparagraph 
(1) or (2) of this paragraph, a group has an election to discontinue 
filing consolidated returns for any taxable year and such group wishes 
to exercise such election, then the common parent must file a separate 
return for such year on or before the last day prescribed by law 
(including extensions of time) for the filing of the consolidated return 
for such year. See section 6081 (relating to extensions of time for 
filing returns).
    (d) When group remains in existence--(1) General rule. A group 
remains in existence for a tax year if the common parent remains as the 
common parent and at least one subsidiary that was affiliated with it at 
the end of the prior year remains affiliated with it at the beginning of 
the year, whether or not one or more corporations have ceased to be 
subsidiaries at any time after the group was formed. Thus, for example,

[[Page 454]]

assume that individual A forms corporation P. P acquires 100 percent of 
the stock of corporation S on January 1, 1965, and P and S file a 
consolidated return for the calendar year 1965. On May 1, 1966, P 
acquires 100 percent of the stock of S-1, and on July 1, 1966, P sells 
the stock of S. The group (consisting originally of P and S) remains in 
existence in 1966 since P has remained as the common parent and at least 
one subsidiary (now S-1) remains affiliated with it.
    (2) Common parent no longer in existence--(i) Mere change in 
identity. For purposes of this paragraph, the common parent corporation 
shall remain as the common parent irrespective of a mere change in 
identity, form, or place of organization of such common parent 
corporation (see section 368(a)(1)(F)).
    (ii) Transfer of assets to subsidiary. The group shall be considered 
as remaining in existence notwithstanding that the common parent is no 
longer in existence if the members of the affiliated group succeed to 
and become the owners of substantially all of the assets of such former 
parent and there remains one or more chains of includible corporations 
connected through stock ownership with a common parent corporation which 
is an includible corporation and which was a member of the group prior 
to the date such former parent ceases to exist. For purposes of applying 
paragraph (f)(2)(i) of Sec. 1.1502-1 to separate return years ending on 
or before the date on which the former parent ceases to exist, such 
former parent, and not the new common parent, shall be considered to be 
the corporation described in such paragraph.
    (iii) Taxable years. If a transfer of assets described in 
subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph is an acquisition to which section 
381(a) applies and if the group files a consolidated return for the 
taxable year in which the acquisition occurs, then for purposes of 
section 381:
    (a) The former common parent shall not close its taxable year merely 
because of the acquisition, and all taxable years of such former parent 
ending on or before the date of acquisition shall be treated as taxable 
years of the acquiring corporation, and
    (b) The corporation acquiring the assets shall close its taxable 
year as of the date of acquisition, and all taxable years of such 
corporation ending on or before the date of acquisition shall be treated 
as taxable years of the transferor corporation.
    (iv) Exception. With respect to acquisitions occurring before 
January 1, 1971, subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph shall not apply 
if the group, in its income tax return, treats the taxable year of the 
former common parent as having closed as of the date of acquisition.
    (3) Reverse acquisitions--(i) In general. If a corporation 
(hereinafter referred to as the ``first corporation'') or any member of 
a group of which the first corporation is the common parent acquires 
after October 1, 1965:
    (a) Stock of another corporation (hereinafter referred to as the 
second corporation), and as a result the second corporation becomes (or 
would become but for the application of this subparagraph) a member of a 
group of which the first corporation is the common parent, or
    (b) Substantially all the assets of the second corporation,

in exchange (in whole or in part) for stock of the first corporation, 
and the stockholders (immediately before the acquisition) of the second 
corporation, as a result of owning stock of the second corporation, own 
(immediately after the acquisition) more than 50 percent of the fair 
market value of the outstanding stock of the first corporation, then any 
group of which the first corporation was the common parent immediately 
before the acquisition shall cease to exist as of the date of 
acquisition, and any group of which the second corporation was the 
common parent immediately before the acquisition shall be treated as 
remaining in existence (with the first corporation becoming the common 
parent of the group). Thus, assume that corporations P and S comprised 
group PS (P being the common parent), that P was merged into corporation 
T (the common parent of a group composed of T and corporation U), and 
that the shareholders of P immediately before the merger, as a result of 
owning stock in P, own 90 percent of the fair market

[[Page 455]]

value of T's stock immediately after the merger. The group of which P 
was the common parent is treated as continuing in existence with T and U 
being added as members of the group, and T taking the place of P as the 
common parent.


For purposes of determining under (a) of this subdivision whether the 
second corporation becomes (or would become) a member of the group of 
which the first corporation is the common parent, and for purposes of 
determining whether the former stockholders of the second corporation 
own more than 50 percent of the outstanding stock of the first 
corporation, there shall be taken into account any acquisitions or 
redemptions of the stock of either corporation which are pursuant to a 
plan of acquisition described in (a) or (b) of this subdivision.
    (ii) Prior ownership of stock. For purposes of subdivision (i) of 
this subparagraph, if the first corporation, and any members of a group 
of which the first corporation is the common parent, have continuously 
owned for a period of at least 5 years ending on the date of the 
acquisition an aggregate of at least 25 percent of the fair market value 
of the outstanding stock of the second corporation, then the first 
corporation (and any subsidiary which owns stock of the second 
corporation immediately before the acquisition) shall, as a result of 
owning such stock, be treated as owning (immediately after the 
acquisition) a percentage of the fair market value of the first 
corporation's outstanding stock which bears the same ratio to (a) the 
percentage of the fair market value of all the stock of the second 
corporation owned immediately before the acquisition by the first 
corporation and its subsidiaries as (b) the fair market value of the 
total outstanding stock of the second corporation immediately before the 
acquisition bears to (c) the sum of (1) the fair market value, 
immediately before the acquisition, of the total outstanding stock of 
the first corporation, and (2) the fair market value, immediately before 
the acquisition, of the total outstanding stock of the second 
corporation (other than any such stock owned by the first corporation 
and any of its subsidiaries). For example, assume that corporation P 
owns stock in corporation T having a fair market value of $100,000, that 
P acquires the remaining stock of T from individuals in exchange for 
stock of P, that immediately before the acquisition the total 
outstanding stock of T had a fair market value of $150,000, and that 
immediately before the acquisition the total outstanding stock of P had 
a fair market value of $200,000. Assuming P owned at least 25 percent of 
the fair market value of T's stock for 5 years, then for purposes of 
this subparagraph, P is treated as owning (immediately after the 
acquisition) 40 percent of the fair market value of its own outstanding 
stock, determined as follows:

                [$150,000/($200,000+$50,000)]x662/3%=40%.

Thus, if the former individual stockholders of T own, immediately after 
the acquisition more than 10 percent of the fair market value of the 
outstanding stock of P as a result of owning stock of T, the group of 
which T was the common parent is treated as continuing in existence with 
P as the common parent, and the group of which P was the common parent 
before the acquisition ceases to exist.
    (iii) Election. The provisions of subdivision (ii) of this 
subparagraph shall not apply to any acquisition occurring in a taxable 
year ending after October 7, 1969, unless the first corporation elects 
to have such subdivision apply. The election shall be made by means of a 
statement, signed by any officer who is duly authorized to act on behalf 
of the first corporation, stating that the corporation elects to have 
the provisions of Sec. 1.1502-75(d)(3)(ii) apply and identifying the 
acquisition to which such provisions will apply. The statement shall be 
filed, on or before the due date (including extensions of time) of the 
return for the group's first consolidated return year ending after the 
date of the acquisition, with the internal revenue officer with whom 
such return is required to be filed.
    (iv) Transfer of assets to subsidiary. This subparagraph shall not 
apply to a transaction to which subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph 
applies.
    (v) Taxable years. If, in a transaction described in subdivision (i) 
of this subparagraph, the first corporation files a

[[Page 456]]

consolidated return for the first taxable year ending after the date of 
acquisition, then:
    (a) The first corporation, and each corporation which, immediately 
before the acquisition, is a member of the group of which the first 
corporation is the common parent, shall close its taxable year as of the 
date of acquisition, and each such corporation shall, immediately after 
the acquisition, change to the taxable year of the second corporation, 
and
    (b) If the acquisition is a transaction described in section 
381(a)(2), then for purposes of section 381:
    (1) All taxable years ending on or before the date of acquisition, 
of the first corporation and each corporation which, immediately before 
the acquisition, is a member of the group of which the first corporation 
is the common parent, shall be treated as taxable years of the 
transferor corporation, and
    (2) The second corporation shall not close its taxable year merely 
because of such acquisition, and all taxable years ending on or before 
the date of acquisition, of the second corporation and each corporation 
which, immediately before the acquisition, is a member of any group of 
which the second corporation is the common parent, shall be treated as 
taxable years of the acquiring corporation.
    (vi) Exception. With respect to acquisitions occurring before April 
17, 1968, subdivision (v) of this subparagraph shall not apply if the 
parties to the transaction, in their income tax returns, treat 
subdivision (i) as not affecting the closing of taxable years or the 
operation of section 381.
    (4) [Reserved]
    (5) Coordination with section 833--(i) Election to continue old 
group. If, solely by reason of the enactment of section 833 (relating to 
certain Blue Cross or Blue Shield organizations and certain other health 
insurers), an organization to which section 833 applies (a ``section 833 
organization'') became the new common parent of an old group on January 
1, 1987, the old group may elect to continue in existence with that 
section 833 organization as its new common parent, provided all the old 
groups having the same section 833 organization as their new common 
parent elect to continue in existence. To revoke this election, see 
paragraph (d)(5)(x) of this section. To file as a new group, see 
paragraph (d)(5)(v) of this section.
    (ii) Old group. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(5), an old group 
is a group which, for its last taxable year ending in 1986, either filed 
a consolidated return or was eligible to (but did not) file a 
consolidated return.
    (iii) Manner of electing to continue--(A) Deemed election. If all 
the members of all the old groups having the same section 833 
organization as their new common parent are included for the first 
taxable year beginning after December 31, 1986, on the same consolidated 
(or amended consolidated) return and a Form 1122 was not filed, the old 
groups are deemed to have elected under paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this 
section to continue in existence.
    (B) Delayed election. If a deemed election to continue in existence 
was not made under paragraph (d)(5)(iii)(A) of this section, all the 
members of all the old groups having the same section 833 organization 
as their new common parent may make a delayed election under paragraph 
(d)(5)(i) of this section to continue in existence by:
    (1) Filing an appropriate consolidated (or amended consolidated) 
return or returns for each taxable year beginning after December 31, 
1986, (notwithstanding Sec. 1.1502-75(a)(1)) on or before January 3, 
1991, and
    (2) On the top of any such return prominently affixing a statement 
containing the following declaration: ``THIS RETURN'' (or, if 
applicable, ``AMENDED RETURN'') ``REFLECTS A DELAYED ELECTION TO 
CONTINUE UNDER Sec. 1.1502-75T(d)(5)(iii)(B)''. A delayed election to 
continue in existence automatically revokes a deemed election to file as 
a new group which was made under paragraph (d)(5)(vi) of this section.
    (iv) Effects of election to continue in existence. If an old group 
or groups elect to continue in existence under paragraph (d)(5)(i) of 
this section, the following rules apply:
    (A) Taxable years. Each member that filed returns other than on a 
calendar year basis shall close its taxable year on December 31, 1986, 
and change to a

[[Page 457]]

calendar year beginning on January 1, 1987. See section 843 and Sec. 
1.1502-76(a)(1).
    (B) Carryovers from separate return limitation years. For purposes 
of applying the separate return limitation year rules to carryovers from 
taxable years beginning before 1987 to taxable years beginning after 
1986, the following rules apply:
    (1) Any taxable year beginning before 1987 of a corporation that was 
not a member of an old group (including a section 833 organization) will 
be treated as a separate return limitation year;
    (2) Any taxable year beginning before 1987 of a corporation that was 
a member of an old group that, without regard to this section and the 
enactment of section 833, was a separate return limitation year will 
continue to be treated as a separate return limitation year;
    (3) Any taxable year beginning before 1987 of a member of an old 
group (other than a separate return limitation year described in 
paragraph (d)(5)(iv)(B)(2) of this section) will not be treated as a 
separate return limitation year with respect to any corporation that was 
a member of such group for each day of that taxable year; and
    (4) Any taxable year beginning before 1987 of a member of an old 
group will be treated as a separate return limitation year with respect 
to any corporation that was not a member of such group for each day of 
that taxable year (e.g., a corporation that was not a member of an old 
group, including a section 833 organization, or a corporation that was a 
member of another old group).
    (C) Five-year rules for life-nonlife groups. Any life-nonlife 
election under section 1504(c)(2) in effect for an old group remains in 
effect. Any old group which was eligible to make a life-nonlife election 
will remain eligible to make the election. For purposes of section 
1503(c), a nonlife member is treated as ineligible under Sec. 1.1502-
47(d)(13) with respect to a life member, unless both were members of the 
same affiliated group (determined without regard to the exclusions in 
section 1504(b) (1) and (2)) for five taxable years immediately 
preceding the taxable year in which the loss arose. See paragraph 
(d)(5)(ix) of this section for a tacking rule.
    (v) Election to file as a new group. If, solely by reason of the 
enactment of section 833, a section 833 organization became the new 
common parent of an old group on January 1, 1987, the application of the 
five-year prohibition on reconsolidation in section 1504(a)(3)(A) to the 
old group is waived and the old group together with the new section 833 
organization common parent may elect to file as a new group provided 
that all includible corporations elect to file a consolidated (or 
amended consolidated) return as a new group for the first taxable year 
beginning after December 31, 1986. To revoke this election, see 
paragraph (d)(5)(x) of this section.
    (vi) Manner of electing to file as a new group--(A) Deemed election. 
The old group or groups and the section 833 organization are deemed to 
have elected under paragraph (d)(5)(v) of this section to file as a new 
group by filing, for the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 
1986, a Form 1122 and a consolidated (or amended consolidated) tax 
return.
    (B) Delayed election. If a deemed election to file as a new group 
was not made pursuant to paragraph (d)(5)(vi)(A) of this section, the 
old group or groups and the section 833 organization may make a delayed 
election under paragraph (d)(5)(v) of this section to file as a new 
group by
    (1) Filing an appropriate consolidated (or amended consolidated) 
return or returns for each taxable year beginning after December 31, 
1986 (notwithstanding Sec. 1.1502-75(a)(1)) on or before January 3, 
1991, and
    (2) On the top of any such return prominently affixing a statement 
containing the following declaration: ``THIS RETURN'' (or, if 
applicable, ``AMENDED RETURN'') ``REFLECTS A DELAYED ELECTION TO FILE AS 
A NEW GROUP UNDER Sec. 1.1502-75T (d)(5)(vi)(B)''. A delayed election 
to file as a new group automatically revokes any deemed election to 
continue in existence which was made under paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this 
section.
    (vii) Effects of election to file as a new group. If an old group or 
groups elect to file as a new group under paragraph

[[Page 458]]

(d)(5)(v) of this section, the following rules apply:
    (A) Termination. Each old group is treated as if it terminated on 
January 1, 1987, and the termination is not treated as resulting from 
the acquisition by a nonmember of all of the stock of the common parent.
    (B) Taxable years. Each member that filed returns other than on a 
calendar year basis shall close its taxable year on December 31, 1986, 
and change to a calendar year beginning on January 1, 1987. See section 
843 and Sec. 1.1502-76(a)(1).
    (C) Separate return limitation year and life-nonlife groups. For 
purposes of Sec. 1.1502-1(f), sections 1503(c) and 1504(c), and Sec. 
1.1502-47, the group is treated as coming into existence as a new group 
on January 1, 1987. Thus, for example, paragraphs (d)(5)(iv) (B) and (C) 
of this section do not apply.
    (viii) Earnings and profits. All distributions after January 1, 1987 
by a corporation, whether or not such corporation was a member of an old 
group, to an existing Blue Cross or Blue Shield organization (as defined 
in section 833(c)(2)) out of earnings and profits accumulated before 
1987 are deemed made out of earnings and profits accumulated in pre-
affiliation years. See Sec. 1.1502-32(h)(5).
    (ix) Five-year tacking rules for certain life-nonlife groups. For 
purposes of applying Sec. 1.1502-47(d) (5) and (12) to any taxable year 
ending after 1986 to a corporation, whether or not the corporation was a 
member of an old group,
    (A) The determination of whether the corporation was in existence 
and a member or tentatively treated as a member of a group, for taxable 
years ending before 1987, is made without regard to the exclusions under 
section 1504(b) (1) and (2) of any section 833 organization or life 
insurance company (as the case may be) and
    (B) A section 833 organization is not treated as having a change in 
tax character solely by reason of the loss of its tax-exempt status due 
to the enactment of section 833.

This paragraph (d)(5)(ix) does not apply if an election to file as a new 
group under paragraph (d)(5)(v) of this section is made.
    (x) Time to revoke elections made before September 5, 1990. An 
election by an old group to continue in existence or to file as a new 
group that was made (or deemed made) before September 5, 1990, may be 
revoked by filing an appropriate return (or returns) on or before 
January 3, 1991. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(5)(x), appropriate 
returns include separate returns filed by each member of the group or 
consolidated returns filed in accordance with a delayed election either 
under paragraph (d)(5)(iii)(B) or (vi)(B) of this section.
    (xi) Examples. The following examples illustrate this paragraph 
(d)(5). In these examples, each corporation uses the calendar year as 
its taxable year.

    Example 1. B is a section 833 organization. For several years, B has 
owned all of the outstanding stock of X, Y, and Z. X has owned all the 
outstanding stock of X<INF>1</INF> throughout X<INF>1</INF>'s existence 
and Y has owned all of the outstanding stock of Y<INF>1</INF> throughout 
Y<INF>1</INF>'s existence. For 1986 X and X<INF>1</INF> filed a 
consolidated federal income tax return but Y and Y<INF>1</INF> filed 
separate returns. Under paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section, X and 
X<INF>1</INF> and Y and Y<INF>1</INF> each constitute an old group 
because they either filed a consolidated return or were eligible to file 
a consolidated return for 1986. The X and Y groups may elect under 
paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section to continue in existence. If they 
elect to continue, under paragraph (d)(5)(iv)(B) of this section, the 
separate return limitation year rules apply as follows: any taxable year 
of B or Z beginning before 1987 is treated as a separate return 
limitation year with respect to each other and to all other members of 
the group; any taxable year of X or X<INF>1</INF> beginning before 1987 
is treated as a separate return limitation year with respect to B, Z, Y 
and Y<INF>1</INF>, but not with respect to each other; and any taxable 
year of Y or Y<INF>1</INF> beginning before 1987 is treated as a 
separate return limitation year with respect to B, Z, X and 
X<INF>1</INF>, but not with respect to each other.
    Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1 except that B is 
owned by C, another section 833 organization. If the X and Y groups 
elect to continue, the results are the same as in Example 1, except 
that, under paragraph (d)(5)(iv)(B)(1) of this section, for purposes of 
applying the separate return limitation year rules, any taxable year of 
C beginning before 1987 is also treated as a separate return limitation 
year with respect to all other members of the group.
    Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example 1 except that Y 
purchased Y<INF>1</INF> on January 1, 1985. If the X and Y groups elect 
to continue, the results are the same as in Example 1, except that, 
under paragraph

[[Page 459]]

(d)(5)(iv)(B)(2) of this section, for purposes of applying the separate 
return limitation year rules, any taxable year of Y<INF>1</INF> 
beginning before 1985 is treated as a separate return limitation year 
with respect to Y as well as with respect to all other members of the 
group.
    Example 4. B, a section 833 organization, has owned all the stock of 
X since November 1984. X has owned all the stock of L, a life insurance 
company, throughout L's existence. In 1986, X and L properly filed a 
life-nonlife consolidated return. Under paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this 
section, the X group elects to continue in existence. Under paragraph 
(d)(5)(iv)(C) of this section, the life-nonlife election will remain in 
effect. However, losses of B which arise before 1990 cannot be used to 
offset the income of L. See section 1503(c)(2) and Sec. 1.1502-
47(d)(13) and paragraph (d)(5)(iv)(C) of this section. Under paragraph 
(d)(5)(iv)(B) of this section, the separate return limitation year rules 
apply as follows: any taxable year of B beginning before 1987 is treated 
as a separate return limitation year with respect to all other members 
of the group; and any taxable year of X or L beginning before 1987 is 
treated as a separate return limitation year with respect to B, but not 
with respect to each other.
    Example 5. The facts are the same as Example 4 except that, on 
January 1, 1984, B formed L<INF>1</INF>, a life insurance company. Under 
paragraph (d)(5)(ix) of this section and section 1504(c), the first year 
L<INF>1</INF> is eligible to join in B's life-nonlife election is 1989.
    Example 6. The facts are the same as in Example 4 except that B and 
the X group elect under paragraph (d)(5)(v) of this section to file as a 
new group. The X group will be considered to have terminated under Sec. 
1.1502-75(d)(1) on December 31, 1986. X and L are each separately 
subject to the separate return limitation year rules of Sec. 1.1502-
1(f). The first year L and L<INF>1</INF> are eligible to join the new 
group in a life-nonlife election is 1992 (five years after the new group 
is formed). See section 1504(c)(2) and paragraphs (d)(5)(vii)(C) and 
(ix) of this section.

    The provisions contained in this Treasury decision are needed to 
immediately amend the consolidated return regulations in response to 
changes made by section 1012 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. It is 
therefore found impracticable and contrary to the public interest to 
issue this Treasury decision with notice and public procedure under 
section 553(b) of title 5 of the United States Code or subject to the 
effective date limitations of section 553(d) of title 5, United States 
Code.
    (e) Failure to include subsidiary. If a consolidated return is 
required for the taxable year under the provisions of paragraph (a)(2) 
of this section, the tax liability of all members of the group for such 
year shall be computed on a consolidated basis even though:
    (1) Separate returns are filed by one or more members of the group, 
or
    (2) There has been a failure to include in the consolidated return 
the income of any member of the group.

If subparagraph (1) of this paragraph applies, the amounts assessed or 
paid upon the basis of separate returns shall be considered as having 
been assessed or paid upon the basis of a consolidated return.
    (f) Inclusion of one or more corporations not members of the group--
(1) Method of determining tax liability. If a consolidated return 
includes the income of a corporation which was not a member of the group 
at any time during the consolidated return year, the tax liability of 
such corporation will be determined upon the basis of a separate return 
(or a consolidated return of another group, if paragraph (a)(2) or 
(b)(3) of this section applies), and the consolidated return will be 
considered as including only the income of the corporations which were 
members of the group during that taxable year. If a consolidated return 
includes the income of two or more corporations which were not members 
of the group but which constitute another group, the tax liability of 
such corporations will be computed in the same manner as if separate 
returns had been made by such corporations unless the Commissioner upon 
application approves the making of a consolidated return for the other 
group or unless under paragraph (a)(2) of this section a consolidated 
return is required for the other group.
    (2) Allocation of tax liability. In any case in which amounts have 
been assessed and paid upon the basis of a consolidated return and the 
tax liability of one or more of the corporations included in the 
consolidated return is to be computed in the manner described in 
subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the amounts so paid shall be 
allocated between the group composed of the corporations properly 
included in the consolidated return and each of the corporations the tax 
liability of which is to be computed on a separate basis (or on the 
basis of a consolidated return of

[[Page 460]]

another group) in such manner as the corporations which were included in 
the consolidated return may, subject to the approval of the 
Commissioner, agree upon or in the absence of an agreement upon the 
method used in allocating the tax liability of the members of the group 
under the provisions of section 1552(a).
    (g) Computing periods of limitation--(1) Income incorrectly included 
in consolidated return. If:
    (i) A consolidated return is filed by a group for the taxable year, 
and
    (ii) The tax liability of a corporation whose income is included in 
such return must be computed on the basis of a separate return (or on 
the basis of a consolidated return with another group), then for the 
purpose of computing any period of limitation with respect to such 
separate return (or such other consolidated return), the filing of such 
consolidated return by the group shall be considered as the making of a 
return by such corporation.
    (2) Income incorrectly included in separate returns. If a 
consolidated return is required for the taxable year under the 
provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the filing of separate 
returns by the members of the group for such year shall not be 
considered as the making of a return for the purpose of computing any 
period of limitation with respect to such consolidated return unless 
there is attached to each such separate return a statement setting 
forth:
    (i) The most recent taxable year of the member for which its income 
was included in a consolidated return, and
    (ii) The reasons for the group's belief that a consolidated return 
is not required for the taxable year.
    (h) Method of filing return and forms--(1) Consolidated return made 
by common parent corporation. The consolidated return shall be made on 
Form 1120 for the group by the common parent corporation. The 
consolidated return, with Form 851 (affiliations schedule) attached, 
shall be filed with the district director with whom the common parent 
would have filed a separate return.
    (2) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1502-75T(h)(2).
    (3) Persons qualified to execute returns and forms. Each return or 
form required to be made or prepared by a corporation must be executed 
by the person authorized under section 6062 to execute returns of 
separate corporations.
    (i) [Reserved]
    (j) Statements and schedules for subsidiaries. The statement of 
gross income and deductions and the schedules required by the 
instructions on the return shall be prepared and filed in columnar form 
so that the details of the items of gross income, deductions, and 
credits for each member may be readily audited. Such statements and 
schedules shall include in columnar form a reconciliation of surplus for 
each corporation, and a reconciliation of consolidated surplus. 
Consolidated balance sheets as of the beginning and close of the taxable 
year of the group, taken from the books of the members, shall accompany 
the consolidated return and shall be prepared in a form similar to that 
required for reconciliation of surplus.
    (k) Cross-reference. See Sec. 1.338(h)(10)-1(d)(7) for special 
rules regarding filing consolidated returns when a section 338(h)(10) 
election is made for a target acquired from a selling consolidated

    (a) through (h)(1) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see Sec. 
1.1502-75(a) through (h)(1).
    (2) Filing of Form 1122 for first year. If, under the provisions of 
Sec. 1.1502-75 (a)(1), a group wishes to file a consolidated return for 
a taxable year, then a Form 1122 (``Authorization and Consent of 
Subsidiary Corporation To Be Included in a Consolidated Income Tax 
Return'') must be executed by each subsidiary. For taxable years 
beginning before January 1, 2003, the executed Forms 1122 must be 
attached to the consolidated return for the taxable year. For

[[Page 461]]

taxable years beginning after December 31, 2002, the group must attach 
either executed Forms 1122 or unsigned copies of the completed Forms 
1122 to the consolidated return. If the group submits unsigned Forms 
1122 with its return, it must retain the signed originals in its records 
in the manner required by Sec. 1.6001-1(e). Form 1122 is not required 
for a taxable year if a consolidated return was filed (or was required 
to be filed) by the group for the immediately preceding taxable year.
    (h)(3) through (k) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see Sec.

Sec. 1.1502-76  Taxable year of members of group.

    (a) Taxable year of members of group--(1) Change to parent's taxable 
year. The consolidated return of a group must be filed on the basis of 
the common parent's taxable year, and each subsidiary must adopt the 
common parent's annual accounting period for the first consolidated 
return year for which the subsidiary's income is includible in the 
consolidated return. If any member is on a 52-53-week taxable year, the 
rule of the preceding sentence shall, with the advance consent of the 
Commissioner, be deemed satisfied if the taxable years of all members of 
the group end within the same 7-day period. Any request for such consent 
shall be filed with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Washington, DC 
20224, not later than the 30th day before the due date (not including 
extensions of time) for the filing of the consolidated return.
    (2) Includible insurance company as member of group. If an 
includible insurance company required by section 843 to file its return 
on the basis of a calendar year is a member of the group and if the 
common parent of such group files its return on the basis of a fiscal 
year, then the first consolidated return which includes the income of 
such insurance company may be filed on the basis of the common parent's 
fiscal year, provided, however, that if such insurance company is a 
member of the group on the last day of the common parent's taxable year, 
all members other than such insurance company change to a calendar year 
or to a 52-53-week taxable year ending within a 7-day period which 
includes December 31, effective immediately after the close of the 
common parent's taxable year. If any member changes to a 52-53-week 
taxable year, the advance consent of the Commissioner shall be obtained 
in accordance with subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.
    (b) Items included in the consolidated return--(1) General rules--
(i) In general. A consolidated return must include the common parent's 
items of income, gain, deduction, loss, and credit for the entire 
consolidated return year, and each subsidiary's items for the portion of 
the year for which it is a member. If the consolidated return includes 
the items of a corporation for only a portion of its tax year determined 
without taking this section into account, items for the portion of the 
year not included in the consolidated return must be included in a 
separate return (including the consolidated return of another group). 
The rules of this paragraph (b) must be applied to prevent the 
duplication or elimination of the corporation's items.
    (ii) The day a corporation becomes or ceases to be a member--(A) End 
of the day rule. (1) In general. If a corporation (S), other than one 
described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A)(2) of this section, becomes or 
ceases to be a member during a consolidated return year, it becomes or 
ceases to be a member at the end of the day on which its status as a 
member changes, and its tax year ends for all Federal income tax 
purposes at the end of that day. Appropriate adjustments must be made if 
another provision of the Internal Revenue Code or the regulations 
thereunder contemplates the event occurring before or after S's change 
in status. For example, S's items restored under Sec. 1.1502-13 
immediately before it becomes a nonmember are taken into account in 
determining the basis of S's stock under Sec. 1.1502-32. On the other 
hand, if a section 338(g) election is made in connection with S becoming 
a member, the deemed asset sale under that section takes place before S 
becomes a member. See Sec. 1.338-10(a)(5) (deemed sale excluded from 
purchasing corporation's consolidated return.)

[[Page 462]]

    (2) Special rule for former S corporations. If S becomes a member in 
a transaction other than in a qualified stock purchase for which an 
election under section 338(g) is made, and immediately before becoming a 
member an election under section 1362(a) was in effect, then S will 
become a member at the beginning of the day the termination of its S 
corporation election is effective. S's tax year ends for all Federal 
income tax purposes at the end of the preceding day. This paragraph 
(b)(1)(ii)(A)(2) applies to transactions occurring after November 10, 
1999.
    (B) Next day rule. If, on the day of S's change in status as a 
member, a transaction occurs that is properly allocable to the portion 
of S's day after the event resulting in the change, S and all persons 
related to S under section 267(b) immediately after the event must treat 
the transaction for all Federal income tax purposes as occurring at the 
beginning of the following day. A determination as to whether a 
transaction is properly allocable to the portion of S's day after the 
event will be respected if it is reasonable and consistently applied by 
all affected persons. In determining whether an allocation is 
reasonable, the following factors are among those to be considered--
    (1) Whether income, gain, deduction, loss, and credit are allocated 
inconsistently (e.g., to maximize a seller's stock basis adjustments 
under Sec. 1.1502-32);
    (2) If the item is from a transaction with respect to S stock, 
whether it reflects ownership of the stock before or after the event 
(e.g., if a member transfers encumbered land to nonmember S in exchange 
for additional S stock in a transaction to which section 351 applies and 
the exchange results in S becoming a member of the consolidated group, 
the applicability of section 357(c) to the exchange must be determined 
under Sec. 1.1502-80(d) by treating the exchange as occurring after the 
event; on the other hand, if S is a member but has a minority 
shareholder and becomes a nonmember as a result of its redemption of 
stock with appreciated property, S's gain under section 311 is treated 
as from a transaction occurring before the event);
    (3) Whether the allocation is inconsistent with other requirements 
under the Internal Revenue Code (e.g., if a section 338(g) election is 
made in connection with a group's acquisition of S, the deemed asset 
sale must take place before S becomes a member and S's gain or loss with 
respect to its assets must be taken into account by S as a nonmember) 
(but see Sec. 1.338-1(d)); and
    (4) Whether other facts exist, such as a prearranged transaction or 
multiple changes in S's status, indicating that the transaction is not 
properly allocable to the portion of S's day after the event resulting 
in S's change.
    (C) Successor corporations. For purposes of this paragraph 
(b)(1)(ii), any reference to a corporation includes a reference to a 
successor or predecessor as the context may require. A corporation is a 
successor if the basis of its assets is determined, directly or 
indirectly, in whole or in part, by reference to the basis of the assets 
of another corporation (the predecessor). For example, if a member forms 
S, S is treated as a member from the beginning of its existence.
    (iii) Group structure changes. If the common parent ceases to be the 
common parent but the group remains in existence, adjustments must be 
made in accordance with the principles of Sec. 1.1502-75(d)(2) and (3).
    (2) Determination of items included in separate and consolidated 
returns--(i) In general. The returns for the years that end and begin 
with S becoming (or ceasing to be) a member are separate tax years for 
all Federal income tax purposes. The returns are subject to the rules of 
the Internal Revenue Code applicable to short periods, as if S ceased to 
exist on becoming a member (or first existed on becoming a nonmember). 
For example, cost recovery deductions under section 168 must be 
allocated for short periods. On the other hand, annualization under 
section 443 is not required of S solely because it has a short year as a 
result of becoming a member. (Similarly, section 443 applies with 
respect to a consolidated return only to the extent that the group's 
return is for a short period and section 443 applies without taking this 
paragraph (b) into account.)

[[Page 463]]

    (ii) Ratable allocation of a year's items--(A) Application. Although 
the periods ending and beginning with S's change in status are different 
tax years, items (other than extraordinary items) may be ratably 
allocated between the periods if--
    (1) S is not required to change its annual accounting period or its 
method of accounting as a result of its change in status (e.g., because 
its stock is sold between consolidated groups that have the same annual 
accounting periods); and
    (2) An irrevocable ratable allocation election is made under 
paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D) of this section.
    (B) General rule--(1) Allocation within original year. Under a 
ratable allocation election, paragraph (b)(2) of this section applies by 
allocating to each day of S's original year (S's tax year determined 
without taking this section into account) an equal portion of S's items 
taken into account in the original year, except that extraordinary items 
must be allocated to the day that they are taken into account. All 
persons affected by the election must take into account S's 
extraordinary items and the ratable allocation of S's remaining items in 
a manner consistent with the election.
    (2) Items to be allocated. Under ratable allocation, the items to be 
allocated and their timing, location, character, and source are 
generally determined by treating the original year as a single tax year, 
and the items are not subject to the rules of the Internal Revenue Code 
applicable to short periods (unless the original year is a short 
period). However, the years ending and beginning with S's change in 
status are treated as different tax years (and as short periods) with 
respect to any item carried to or from these years (e.g., a net 
operating loss carried under section 172) and with respect to the 
application of section 481.
    (3) Multiple applications. If this paragraph (b) applies more than 
once with respect to an original year, adjustments must be made in 
accordance with the principles of this paragraph (b). For example, if S 
becomes a member of two different consolidated groups during the same 
original year and ratable allocation is elected with respect to both 
groups, ratable allocation is generally determined for both groups by 
treating the original year as a single tax year; however, if ratable 
allocation is elected only with respect to the first group, the ratable 
allocation is determined by treating the original year as a short period 
that does not include the period that S is a member of the second group. 
Ratable allocation is not a method of accounting, and ratable allocation 
with respect to one application of this paragraph (b) to S does not 
require ratable allocation to be subsequently applied with respect to S.
    (C) Extraordinary items. An extraordinary item is--
    (1) Any item from the disposition or abandonment of a capital asset 
as defined in section 1221 (determined without the application of any 
other rules of law);
    (2) Any item from the disposition or abandonment of property used in 
a trade or business as defined in section 1231(b) (determined without 
the application of any holding period requirement);
    (3) Any item from the disposition or abandonment of an asset 
described in section 1221(1), (3), (4), or (5), if substantially all the 
assets in the same category from the same trade or business are disposed 
of or abandoned in one transaction (or series of related transactions);
    (4) Any item from assets disposed of in an applicable asset 
acquisition under section 1060(c);
    (5) Any item carried to or from any portion of the original year 
(e.g., a net operating loss carried under section 172), and any section 
481(a) adjustment;
    (6) The effects of any change in accounting method initiated by the 
filing of the appropriate form after S's change in status;
    (7) Any item from the discharge or retirement of indebtedness (e.g., 
cancellation of indebtedness income or a deduction for retirement at a 
premium);
    (8) Any item from the settlement of a tort or similar third-party 
liability;
    (9) Any compensation-related deduction in connection with S's change 
in

[[Page 464]]

status (including, for example, deductions from bonus, severance, and 
option cancellation payments made in connection with S's change in 
status);
    (10) Any dividend income from a nonmember that S controls within the 
meaning of section 304 at the time the dividend is taken into account;
    (11) Any deemed income inclusion from a foreign corporation, or any 
deferred tax amount on an excess distribution from a passive foreign 
investment company under section 1291;
    (12) Any interest expense allocable under section 172(h) to a 
corporate equity reduction transaction causing this paragraph (b) to 
apply;
    (13) Any credit, to the extent it arises from activities or items 
that are not ratably allocated (e.g., the rehabilitation credit under 
section 47, which is based on placement in service); and
    (14) Any item which, in the opinion of the Commissioner, would, if 
ratably allocated, result in a substantial distortion of income in any 
consolidated return or separate return in which the item is included.
    (D) Election. The election to ratably allocate items under this 
paragraph (b)(2)(ii) must be made in a separate statement entitled 
``THIS IS AN ELECTION UNDER Sec. 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii) TO RATABLY 
ALLOCATE THE YEAR'S ITEMS OF [insert name and employer identification 
number of the member].'' The statement must be signed by the member and 
by the common parent of each affected group, and must be filed with the 
returns including the items for the year's ending and beginning with S's 
change in status. If two or more members of the same consolidated group, 
as a consequence of the same plan or arrangement, cease to be members of 
that group and remain affiliated as members of another consolidated 
group, an election under this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D) may be made only 
if it is made by each such member. The statement must provide all of the 
following:
    (1) Identify the extraordinary items, their amounts, and the 
separate or consolidated returns in which they are included.
    (2) Identify the aggregate amount to be ratably allocated, and the 
portion of the amount included in the separate and consolidated returns.
    (3) Include the name and employer identification number of the 
common parent (if any) of each group that must take the items into 
account.
    (iii) Ratable allocation of a month's items. If ratable allocation 
under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section is not elected (e.g., because 
S is required to change its annual accounting period), this paragraph 
(b)(2)(iii) may be applied to ratably allocate only S's items taken into 
account in the month of its change in status, but only if the allocation 
is consistently applied by all affected persons. The ratable allocation 
is made by applying the principles of paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this 
section under any reasonable method. For example, S may close its books 
both at the end of the preceding month and at the end of the month of 
the change, and allocate only its items (other than extraordinary items) 
from the month of the change. See paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B) of this 
section for factors to be considered in determining whether the method 
is reasonable.
    (iv) Taxes. To the extent properly taken into account during the 
member's tax year (determined without the application of this paragraph 
(b)), Federal, state, local, and foreign taxes are allocated under 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section on the basis of the items or activities 
to which the taxes relate. Thus, income tax is allocated based on the 
inclusion of the income (determined under the principles of this 
paragraph (b)) to which the tax relates. For example, if a calendar-year 
domestic corporation has $100 of foreign source dividend income 
(determined in accordance with United States tax accounting principles 
but without taking this paragraph (b) into account) that is passive 
income for purposes of section 904, and $60 of the income is allocated 
under this paragraph (b) to the period of the calendar year after it 
becomes a member of a consolidated group, then 60% of the corporation's 
deemed paid foreign tax credit associated with its dividend income for 
the calendar year is taken into account in computing the group's passive 
basket consolidated foreign tax credit. Similarly, property

[[Page 465]]

taxes relate to the ownership of property and are allocated over the 
period that the property is owned. This paragraph (b)(2)(iv) applies 
without regard to any determination or allocation by another taxing 
jurisdiction.
    (v) Acquisition of S corporation. If a corporation is acquired in a 
transaction to which paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A)(2) of this section applies, 
then paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this section do not apply and 
items of income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit are assigned to each 
short taxable year on the basis of the corporation's normal method of 
accounting as determined under section 446. This paragraph (b)(2)(v) 
applies to transactions occurring after November 10, 1999.
    (vi) Passthrough entities--(A) In general. If S is a partner in a 
partnership or an owner of a similar interest with respect to which 
items of the entity are taken into account by S, S is treated, solely 
for purposes of determining the year to which the entity's items are 
allocated under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, as selling or 
exchanging its entire interest in the entity immediately before S's 
change in status.
    (B) Treatment as a conduit. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2), 
if a member (together with other members) would be treated under section 
318(a)(2) as owning an aggregate of at least 50% of any stock owned by 
the passthrough entity, the method that is used to determine the 
inclusion of the entity's items in the consolidated or separate return 
must be the same method that is used to determine the inclusion of the 
member's items in the consolidated or separate return.
    (C) Exception for certain foreign entities. This paragraph (b)(2)(v) 
does not apply to any foreign corporation generating the deemed 
inclusion of income, or to any passive foreign investment company 
generating a deferred tax amount on an excess distribution under section 
1291.
    (3) Anti-avoidance rule. If any person acts with a principal purpose 
contrary to the purposes of this paragraph (b), to substantially reduce 
the Federal income tax liability of any person, adjustments must be made 
as necessary to carry out the purposes of this section.
    (4) Determination of due date for separate return. Paragraph (c) of 
this section contains rules for the filing of the separate return 
referred to in this paragraph (b). In applying paragraph (c) of this 
section, the due date for the filing of S's separate return shall also 
be determined without regard to the ending of the tax year under 
paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section or the deemed cessation of its 
existence under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.
    (5) Examples. For purposes of the examples in this paragraph (b), 
unless otherwise stated, P and X are common parents of calendar-year 
consolidated groups, P owns all of the only class of T's stock, T owns 
no stock of lower-tier members, all persons use the accrual method of 
accounting, the facts set forth the only corporate activity, all 
transactions are between unrelated persons, tax liabilities are 
disregarded, and any election required under paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section is properly made. The principles of this paragraph (b) are 
illustrated by the following examples.

    Example 1. Items allocated between consolidated and separate 
returns. (a) Facts. P and S are the only members of the P group. P sells 
all of S's stock to individual A on June 30, and therefore S becomes a 
nonmember on July 1 of Year 2.
    (b) Analysis. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the P group's 
consolidated return for Year 2 includes P's income for the entire tax 
year and S's income for the period from January 1 to June 30, and S must 
file a separate return for the period from July 1 to December 31.
    (c) Acquisition of another subsidiary before end of tax year. The 
facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this Example 1, except that on 
July 31 P acquires all the stock of T (which filed a separate return for 
its year ending on November 30 of Year 1) and T therefore becomes a 
member on August 1 of Year 2. Under Sec. 1.1502-75(d) and paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section, the P group's consolidated return for Year 2 
includes P's income for the entire year, S's income from January 1 to 
June 30, and T's income from August 1 to December 31. S must file a 
separate return that includes its income from July 1 to December 31, and 
T must file a separate return that includes its income from December 1 
of Year 1 to July 31 of Year 2. (If P had acquired T after December 31, 
the P group that included S is a different group from the P group that 
includes T, and, for example, the

[[Page 466]]

P group that includes T must make a separate election under section 1501 
and Sec. 1.1502-75 if consolidated returns are to be filed.)
    Example 2. Group structure change. (a) Facts. P owns all of the 
stock of S and T. Shortly after the beginning of Year 1, P merges into T 
in a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(A) (and in section 
368(a)(1)(D)), and P's shareholders receive T's stock in exchange for 
all of P's stock. The P group is treated under Sec. 1.1502-75(d)(2)(ii) 
as remaining in existence with T as its common parent.
    (b) Analysis. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the P group's 
return must include the common parent's items for the entire 
consolidated return year and, if the common parent ceases to be the 
common parent but the group remains in existence, appropriate 
adjustments must be made. Consequently, although P did not exist for all 
of Year 1, P's items for the portion of Year 1 ending with the merger 
are treated as the items of the common parent that must be included in 
the P group's return for Year 1.
    (c) Reverse acquisition. Assume instead that X acquires all of P's 
assets in exchange for more than 50% of X's stock in a reorganization 
described in section 368(a)(1)(D). The reorganization constitutes a 
reverse acquisition under Sec. 1.1502-75(d)(3), with the X group 
terminating and the P group surviving with X as its common parent. 
Consequently, P's items for the portion of Year 1 ending with the 
acquisition are treated as the items of the common parent that must be 
included in the P group's return for Year 1, and X's items are treated 
for purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section as the items of a 
subsidiary included in the P group's return for the portion of Year 1 
for which X is a member.
    Example 3. Ratable allocation. (a) Facts. P sells all of T's stock 
to X, and T becomes a nonmember on July 1 of Year 1. T engages in the 
production and sale of merchandise throughout Year 1 and is required to 
use inventories. The sale is treated as causing T's tax year to end on 
June 30, and the periods beginning and ending with the sale are treated 
as two tax years for Federal income tax purposes.
    (b) Analysis. If ratable allocation under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of 
this section is not elected, T must perform an inventory valuation as of 
the acquisition and also as of the end of Year 1. If ratable allocation 
is elected, T must perform an inventory valuation only as of the close 
of Year 1, and T's income from inventory is ratably allocated, along 
with T's other items that are not extraordinary items, between the P and 
X consolidated returns.
    (c) Merger into nonmember. Assume instead that T merges into a 
wholly owned subsidiary of X in a reorganization described in section 
368(a)(2)(D), and P receives 10% of X's stock in exchange for all of T's 
stock. Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, because T's tax 
year ends on June 30 under section 381(b)(1), T's original year 
determined without taking paragraph (b) of this section into account 
also ends on June 30. Consequently, a ratable allocation under paragraph 
(b)(2)(ii) of this section is the same as an allocation based on closing 
the books.
    Example 4. Net operating loss. P sells all of T's stock to X, T 
becomes a nonmember on June 30 of Year 1, and ratable allocation under 
paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section is elected. Under ratable 
allocation, the X group has a $100 consolidated net operating loss for 
Year 1, all of which is attributable to T. However, because of 
extraordinary items, T has $100 of income for the portion of Year 1 that 
T is a member of the P group. Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B)(2) of this 
section, T's loss may be carried back from the X group to the portion of 
Year 1 that T was a member of the P group. See also section 172 and 
Sec. 1.1502-21(b). Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C)(5) of this section, 
any item carried to or from any portion of the original year is an 
extraordinary item, and the loss therefore is not taken into account 
again in determining the ratable allocation under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) 
of this section.
    Example 5. Employee benefit plans. (a) Facts. P sells all of T's 
stock to X, and T becomes a nonmember on June 30 of Year 1. On March 15 
of Year 2, T contributes $100 to its retirement plan, which is a 
qualified plan under section 401(a). T is not required to make quarterly 
contributions to the plan for Year 1 under section 412(m). The 
contribution is made on account of T's taxable period beginning on July 
1 of Year 1, and is deemed in accordance with section 404(a)(6) to have 
been made on the last day of T's taxable period beginning on July 1 of 
Year 1. Ratable allocation under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section is 
not elected.
    (b) Analysis. Under paragraph (b) of this section, the sale is 
treated as causing T's tax year to end on June 30, and the period 
beginning on July 1 is treated as a separate annual accounting period 
for all Federal income tax purposes. T's income from January 1 to June 
30 is included in the P group's Year 1 return, and T's income from July 
1 to December 31 is included in the X group's Year 1 return. Thus, the 
$100 contribution is deductible by T for the period of Year 1 that it is 
a member of the X group, subject to the applicable limitations of 
section 404, if a contribution on the last day of that period would 
otherwise be deductible.
    (c) The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this Example 5, 
except that, in accordance with section 404(a)(6), $40 of the $100 
contribution is made on account of T's taxable period beginning on 
January 1 of Year 1 and is deemed to be made on the last day of T's 
taxable period beginning on January 1 of

[[Page 467]]

Year 1. The remaining $60 is made on account of T's taxable period 
beginning on July 1 of Year 1 and is deemed to be made on the last day 
of T's taxable period beginning on July 1 of Year 1. As in paragraph (b) 
of this Example 5, under paragraph (b) of this section, the sale is 
treated as causing T's tax year to end on June 30, and the period 
beginning on July 1 is treated as a separate annual accounting period 
for all Federal income tax purposes. The $40 portion of the contribution 
is deductible by T for the period of Year 1 that it is a member of the P 
group, subject to the applicable limitations of section 404 and provided 
that a $40 contribution on the last day of that period would otherwise 
be deductible for that period, and the $60 portion is deductible by T 
for the period of Year 1 that it is a member of the X group, subject to 
the same conditions.
    (d) Ratable allocation. The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) 
of this Example 5, except that P, T, and X elect ratable allocation 
under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section and T's deduction for the 
retirement plan contribution is not an extraordinary item. T's deduction 
may be ratably allocated, subject to the applicable limitations of 
section 404, and is allowable only if a contribution on the last day of 
Year 1 otherwise would be deductible for any period in the year. (The 
results would be the same if S were an unaffiliated corporation when 
acquired by X, and the due date of its last separate return (including 
extensions) were before the pension contribution was made on March 15 of 
Year 2.)
    Example 6. Allocation of partnership items. (a) Facts. P sells all 
of T's stock to X, and T becomes a nonmember on June 30 of Year 1. T has 
a 10% interest in the capital and profits of a calendar-year 
partnership.
    (b) Analysis. Under paragraph (b)(2)(vi)(A) of this section, T is 
treated, solely for purposes of determining T's tax year in which the 
partnership's items are included, as selling or exchanging its entire 
interest in the partnership as of P's sale of T's stock. Thus, the 
deemed disposition is not taken into account under section 708, it does 
not result in gain or loss being recognized by T, and T's holding period 
is unaffected. However, under section 706(a), in determining T's income, 
T is required to include its distributive share of partnership items for 
the partnership's year ending within or with T's tax year. Under section 
706(c)(2), the partnership's tax year is treated as closing with respect 
to T for this purpose as of P's sale of T's stock. The allocation of T's 
distributive share of partnership items must be made under Sec. 1.706-
1(c)(2)(ii).
    (c) Controlled partnership. The facts are the same as in paragraph 
(a) of this Example 6, except that T has a 75% interest in the capital 
and profits of the partnership. Under paragraph (b)(2)(vi)(B) of this 
section, T's distributive share of the partnership items is treated as 
T's items for purposes of paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Thus, if 
ratable allocation under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section is not 
elected, T's distributive share of the partnership's items must be 
determined under Sec. 1.706-1(c)(2)(ii) by an interim closing of the 
partnership's books. Similarly, if ratable allocation is elected for T's 
items that are not extraordinary items, T's distributive share of the 
partnership's nonextraordinary items must also be ratably allocated 
under Sec. 1.706-1(c)(2)(ii).
    Example 7. Acquisition of S corporation. (a) Facts. Z is a small 
business corporation for which an election under section 1362(a) was in 
effect at all times since Year 1. At all times, Z had only 100 shares of 
stock outstanding, all of which were owned by individual A. On July 1 of 
Year 3, P acquired all of the Z stock. P does not make an election under 
section 338(g) with respect to its purchase of the Z stock.
    (b) Analysis. As a result of P's acquisition of the Z stock, Z's 
election under section 1362(a) terminates. See sections 1361(b)(1)(B) 
and 1362(d)(2). Z is required to join in the filing of the P 
consolidated return. See Sec. 1.1502-75. Z's tax year ends for all 
Federal income tax purposes on June 30 of Year 3. If no extension of 
time is sought, Z must file a separate return for the period from 
January 1 through June 30 of Year 3 on or before March 15 of Year 4. See 
paragraph (b)(4) of this section. Z will become a member of the P 
consolidated group as of July 1 of Year 3. See paragraph 
(b)(1)(ii)(A)(2) of this section. P group's Year 3 consolidated return 
will include Z's items from July 1 to December 31 of Year 3.

    (6) Effective date--(i) General rule. Except as provided in 
paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) (A)(2) and (b)(2)(v) of this section, this 
paragraph (b) applies to corporations becoming or ceasing to be members 
of consolidated groups on or after January 1, 1995.
    (ii) Prior law. For prior transactions, see prior regulations under 
section 1502 as in effect with respect to the transaction. See, e.g., 
Sec. 1.1502-76(b) and (d) as contained in the 26 CFR part 1 edition 
revised as of April 1, 1994. However, Sec. 1.1502-76(b)(5) and (6) as 
contained in the 26 CFR part 1 edition revised as of April 1, 1994 do 
not apply with respect to corporations becoming or ceasing to be members 
of consolidated groups on or after January 1, 1995. If both this 
paragraph (b) and prior law may apply to determine the inclusion of any

[[Page 468]]

amount in a return, appropriate adjustments must be made to prevent the 
omission or duplication of the amount.
    (c) Time for making separate returns for periods not included in 
consolidated return--(1) Consolidated return filed by due date for 
separate return. If the group has filed a consolidated return on or 
before the due date for the filing of a subsidiary's separate return 
(including extensions of time and determined without regard to any 
change of its taxable year required under paragraph (a) of this 
section), then the separate return for any portion of the subsidiary's 
taxable year for which its income is not included in the consolidated 
return of the group must be filed no later than the due date of such 
consolidated return (including extensions of time).
    (2) Consolidated return not filed by due date for separate return. 
If the group has not filed a consolidated return on or before the due 
date for the filing of a subsidiary corporation's separate return 
(including extensions of time and determined without regard to any 
change of its taxable year required under paragraph (a) of this 
section), then on or before such due date such subsidiary shall file a 
separate return either for the portion of its taxable year for which its 
income would not be included in a consolidated return if such a return 
were filed, or for its complete taxable year. However, if a separate 
return is filed for such portion of its taxable year and the group 
subsequently does not file a consolidated return, such subsidiary 
corporation shall file a substituted return for its complete taxable 
year not later than the due date (including extensions of time) 
prescribed for the filing of the common parent's return. On the other 
hand, if the return is filed for the subsidiary's complete taxable year 
and the group later files a consolidated return, such subsidiary must 
file an amended return not later than the due date (including extensions 
of time) for the filing of the consolidated return of the group. Such 
amended return shall be for that portion of such subsidiary's taxable 
year which is not included in the consolidated return. If, under this 
subparagraph, a substituted return must befiled, then the return 
previously filed shall not be considered a return within the meaning of 
section 6011. If, under this subparagraph, a substituted or amended 
return must be filed, then, for purposes of sections 6513(a) and 
6601(a), the last date prescribed for payment of tax shall be the due 
date (not including extensions of time) for the filing of the 
subsidiary's separate return (determined without regard to this 
subparagraph and without regard to any change of its taxable year 
required under paragraph (a) of this section).
    (3) Examples. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by 
the following examples:

    Example (1). Corporation P, which filed a separate return for the 
calendar year 1966, acquires all of the stock of corporation S as of the 
close of December 31, 1966. Corporation S reports its income on the 
basis of a fiscal year ending March 31. On June 15, 1967, the due date 
for the filing of a separate return by S (assuming no extensions of 
time), a consolidated return has not been filed for the group (P and S). 
On such date S may either file a return for the period April 1, 1966, 
through December 31, 1966, or it may file a return for the complete 
fiscal year ending March 31, 1967. If S files a return for the short 
period ending December 31, 1966, and if the group elects not to file a 
consolidated return for the calendar year 1967, S, on or before March 
15, 1968 (the due date of P's return, assuming no extensions of time), 
must file a substituted return for the complete fiscal year ending March 
31, 1967, in lieu of the return previously filed for the short period. 
Interest is computed from June 15, 1967. If, however, S files a return 
for the complete fiscal year ending March 31, 1967, and the group elects 
to file a consolidated return for the calendar year 1967, then S must 
file an amended return covering the period from April 1, 1966, through 
December 31, 1966, in lieu of the return previously filed for the 
complete fiscal year. Interest is computed from June 15, 1967.
    Example (2). Assume the same facts as in example (1) except that 
corporation P acquires all of the stock of corporation S at the close of 
September 30, 1967, and that P files a consolidated return for the group 
for 1967 on March 15, 1968 (not having obtained any extensions of time). 
Since a consolidated return has been filed on or before the due date 
(June 15, 1968) for the filing of the separate return for the taxable 
year ending March 31, 1968, the return of S for the short

[[Page 469]]

taxable year beginning April 1, 1967, and ending September 30, 1967, 
should be filed no later than March 15, 1968.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1502-77  Agent for the group.

    (a) Scope of agency--(1) In general--(i) Common parent. Except as 
provided in paragraphs (a)(3) and (6) of this section, the common parent 
(or a substitute agent described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this 
section) for a consolidated return year is the sole agent (agent for the 
group) that is authorized to act in its own name with respect to all 
matters relating to the tax liability for that consolidated return year, 
for--
    (A) Each member in the group; and
    (B) Any successor (see paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section) of a 
member.
    (ii) Substitute agents. For purposes of this section, any 
corporation designated as a substitute agent pursuant to paragraph (d) 
of this section to replace the common parent or a previously designated 
substitute agent acts as agent for the group to the same extent and 
subject to the same limitations as are applicable to the common parent, 
and any reference in this section to the common parent includes any such 
substitute agent.
    (iii) Successor. For purposes of this section only, the term 
successor means an individual or entity (including a disregarded entity) 
that is primarily liable, pursuant to applicable law (including, for 
example, by operation of a state or Federal merger statute), for the tax 
liability of a member of the group. Such determination is made without 
regard to Sec. 1.1502-1(f)(4) or 1.1502-6(a). (For inclusion of a 
successor in references to a subsidiary or member, see paragraph (c)(2) 
of this section.)
    (iv) Disregarded entity. If a subsidiary of a group becomes, or its 
successor is or becomes, a disregarded entity for Federal tax purposes, 
the common parent continues to serve as the agent with respect to that 
subsidiary's tax liability under Sec. 1.1502-6 for consolidated return 
years during which it was included in the group, even though the entity 
generally is not treated as a person separate from its owner for Federal 
tax purposes.
    (v) Transferee liability. For purposes of assessing, paying and 
collecting transferee liability, any exercise of or reliance on the 
common parent's agency authority pursuant to this section is binding on 
a transferee (or subsequent transferees) of a member, regardless of 
whether the member's existence terminates prior to such exercise or 
reliance.
    (vi) Purported common parent. If any corporation files a 
consolidated return purporting to be the common parent of a consolidated 
group but is subsequently determined not to have been the common parent 
of the claimed group, that corporation is treated, to the extent 
necessary to avoid prejudice to the Commissioner, as if it were the 
common parent.
    (2) Examples of matters subject to agency. With respect to any 
consolidated return year for which it is the common parent--
    (i) The common parent makes any election (or similar choice of a 
permissible option) that is available to a subsidiary in the computation 
of its separate taxable income, and any change in an election (or 
similar choice of a permissible option) previously made by or for a 
subsidiary, including, for example, a request to change a subsidiary's 
method or period of accounting;
    (ii) All correspondence concerning the income tax liability for the 
consolidated return year is carried on directly with the common parent;
    (iii) The common parent files for all extensions of time, including 
extensions of time for payment of tax under section 6164, and any 
extension so filed is considered as having been filed by each member;
    (iv) The common parent gives waivers, gives bonds, and executes 
closing agreements, offers in compromise, and all other documents, and 
any waiver or bond so given, or agreement, offer in compromise, or any 
other document so executed, is considered as having also been given or 
executed by each member;

[[Page 470]]

    (v) The common parent files claims for refund, and any refund is 
made directly to and in the name of the common parent and discharges any 
liability of the Government to any member with respect to such refund;
    (vi) The common parent takes any action on behalf of a member of the 
group with respect to a foreign corporation, for example, elections by, 
and changes to the method of accounting of, a controlled foreign 
corporation in accordance with Sec. 1.964-1(c)(3);
    (vii) Notices of claim disallowance are mailed only to the common 
parent, and the mailing to the common parent is considered as a mailing 
to each member;
    (viii) Notices of deficiencies are mailed only to the common parent 
(except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section), and the mailing 
to the common parent is considered as a mailing to each member;
    (ix) Notices of final partnership administrative adjustment under 
section 6223 with respect to any partnership in which a member of the 
group is a partner may be mailed to the common parent, and, if so, the 
mailing to the common parent is considered as a mailing to each member 
that is a partner entitled to receive such notice (for other rules 
regarding partnership proceedings, see paragraphs (a)(3)(v) and 
(a)(6)(iii) of this section);
    (x) The common parent files petitions and conducts proceedings 
before the United States Tax Court, and any such petition is considered 
as also having been filed by each member;
    (xi) Any assessment of tax may be made in the name of the common 
parent, and an assessment naming the common parent is considered as an 
assessment with respect to each member; and
    (xii) Notice and demand for payment of taxes is given only to the 
common parent, and such notice and demand is considered as a notice and 
demand to each member.
    (3) Matters reserved to subsidiaries. Except as provided in this 
paragraph (a)(3) and paragraph (a)(6) of this section, no subsidiary has 
authority to act for or to represent itself in any matter related to the 
tax liability for the consolidated return year. The following matters, 
however, are reserved exclusively to each subsidiary--
    (i) The making of the consent required by Sec. 1.1502-75(a)(1);
    (ii) Any action with respect to the subsidiary's liability for a 
federal tax other than the income tax imposed by chapter 1 of the 
Internal Revenue Code (including, for example, employment taxes under 
chapters 21 through 25 of the Internal Revenue Code, and miscellaneous 
excise taxes under chapters 31 through 47 of the Internal Revenue Code);
    (iii) The making of an election under section 936(e);
    (iv) The making of an election to be treated as a DISC under Sec. 
1.992-2; and
    (v) Any actions by a subsidiary acting as tax matters partner under 
sections 6221 through 6234 and the accompanying regulations (but see 
paragraph (a)(2)(ix) of this section regarding the mailing of a final 
partnership administrative adjustment to the common parent).
    (4) Term of agency--(i) In general. Except as provided in paragraph 
(a)(4)(iii) of this section, the common parent for the consolidated 
return year remains the agent for the group with respect to that year 
until the common parent's existence terminates, regardless of whether 
one or more subsidiaries in that year cease to be members of the group, 
whether the group files a consolidated return for any subsequent year, 
whether the common parent ceases to be the common parent or a member of 
the group in any subsequent year, or whether the group continues 
pursuant to Sec. 1.1502-75(d) with a new common parent in any 
subsequent year.
    (ii) Replacement of substitute agent designated by Commissioner. If 
the Commissioner replaces a previously designated substitute agent 
pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, the replaced 
substitute agent ceases to be the agent after the Commissioner 
designates another substitute agent.
    (iii) New common parent after a group structure change. If the group 
continues in existence with a new common parent pursuant to Sec. 
1.1502-75(d) during a consolidated return year, the common parent at the 
beginning of the year is the agent for the group through the date of

[[Page 471]]

the Sec. 1.1502-75(d) transaction, and the new common parent becomes 
the agent for the group beginning the day after the transaction, at 
which time it becomes the agent for the group with respect to the entire 
consolidated return year (including the period through the date of the 
transaction) and the former common parent is no longer the agent for 
that year.
    (5) Identifying members in notice of a lien. Notwithstanding any 
other provisions of this paragraph (a), any notice of a lien, any levy 
or any other proceeding to collect the amount of any assessment, after 
the assessment has been made, must name the entity from which such 
collection is to be made.
    (6) Direct dealing with a member--(i) Several liability. The 
Commissioner may, upon issuing to the common parent written notice that 
expressly invokes the authority of this provision, deal directly with 
any member of the group with respect to its liability under Sec. 
1.1502-6 for the consolidated tax of the group, in which event such 
member has sole authority to act for itself with respect to that 
liability. However, if the Commissioner believes or has reason to 
believe that the existence of the common parent has terminated, he may, 
if he deems it advisable, deal directly with any member with respect to 
that member's liability under Sec. 1.1502-6 without giving the notice 
required by this provision.
    (ii) Information requests. The Commissioner may, upon informing the 
common parent, request information relevant to the consolidated tax 
liability from any member of the group. However, if the Commissioner 
believes or has reason to believe that the existence of the common 
parent has terminated, he may request such information from any member 
of the group without informing the common parent.
    (iii) Members as partners in partnerships. The Commissioner 
generally will deal directly with any member in its capacity as a 
partner of a partnership that is subject to the provisions of sections 
6221 through 6234 and the accompanying regulations (but see paragraph 
(a)(2)(ix) of this section regarding the mailing of a final partnership 
administrative adjustment to the common parent). However, if requested 
to do so in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 301.6223(c)-1(b) of 
this chapter, the Commissioner may deal with the common parent as agent 
for such member on any matter related to the partnership, except in 
regards to a settlement under section 6224(c) and except to the extent 
the member acts as tax matters partner of the partnership.
    (b) Copy of notice of deficiency to entity that has ceased to be a 
member of the group. An entity that ceases to be a member of the group 
during or after a consolidated return year may file a written notice of 
that fact with the Commissioner and request a copy of any notice of 
deficiency with respect to the tax for a consolidated return year during 
which the entity was a member, or a copy of any notice and demand for 
payment of such deficiency, or both. Such filing does not limit the 
scope of the agency of the common parent provided for in paragraph (a) 
of this section. Any failure by the Commissioner to comply with such 
request does not limit an entity's tax liability under Sec. 1.1502-6. 
For purposes of this paragraph (b), references to an entity include a 
successor of such entity.
    (c) References to member or subsidiary. For purposes of this 
section, all references to a member or subsidiary for a consolidated 
return year include--
    (1) Each corporation that was a member of the group during any part 
of such year (except that any reference to a subsidiary does not include 
the common parent);
    (2) Except as indicated otherwise, a successor (as defined in 
paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section) of any corporation described in 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section; and
    (3) Each corporation whose income was included in the consolidated 
return for such year, notwithstanding that the tax liability of such 
corporation should have been computed on the basis of a separate return, 
or as a member of another consolidated group, under the provisions of 
Sec. 1.1502-75.
    (d) Termination of common parent--(1) Designation of substitute 
agent by common parent. (i) If the common parent's existence terminates, 
it may designate a substitute agent for the group and notify the 
Commissioner, as provided in this paragraph (d)(1).

[[Page 472]]

    (A) Subject to the Commissioner's approval under paragraph 
(d)(1)(ii) of this section, before the common parent's existence 
terminates, the common parent may designate, for each consolidated 
return year for which it is the common parent and for which the period 
of limitations either for assessment, for collection after assessment, 
or for claiming a credit or refund has not expired, one of the following 
to act as substitute agent in its place--
    (1) Any corporation that was a member of the group during any part 
of the consolidated return year and, except as provided in paragraph 
(e)(3)(ii) of this section, has not subsequently been disregarded as an 
entity separate from its owner or reclassified as a partnership for 
Federal tax purposes; or
    (2) Any successor (as defined in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this 
section) of such a corporation or of the common parent that is a 
domestic corporation (and, except as provided in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of 
this section, is not disregarded as an entity separate from its owner or 
classified as a partnership for Federal tax purposes), including a 
corporation that will become a successor at the time that the common 
parent's existence terminates.
    (B) The common parent must notify the Commissioner in writing (under 
procedures prescribed by the Commissioner) of the designation and 
provide the following--
    (1) An agreement executed by the designated corporation agreeing to 
serve as the group's substitute agent; and
    (2) If the designated corporation was not itself a member of the 
group during the consolidated return year (because the designated 
corporation is a successor of a member of the group for the consolidated 
return year), a statement by the designated corporation acknowledging 
that it is or will be primarily liable for the consolidated tax as a 
successor of a member.
    (ii) A designation under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(A) of this section does 
not apply unless and until it is approved by the Commissioner. The 
Commissioner's approval of such a designation is not effective before 
the existence of the common parent terminates.
    (2) Default substitute agent. If the common parent fails to 
designate a substitute agent for the group before its existence 
terminates and if the common parent has a single successor that is a 
domestic corporation, such successor becomes the substitute agent for 
the group upon termination of the common parent's existence. However, 
see paragraph (d)(4) of this section regarding the consequences of the 
successor's failure to notify the Commissioner of its status as default 
substitute agent in accordance with procedures established by the 
Commissioner.
    (3) Designation by the Commissioner. (i) In the event the common 
parent's existence terminates and no designation is made and approved 
under paragraph (d)(1) of this section and the Commissioner believes or 
has reason to believe that there is no successor of the common parent 
that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (d)(2) of this section (or 
the Commissioner believes or has reason to believe there is such a 
successor but has no last known address on file for such successor), the 
Commissioner may, at any time, with or without a request from any member 
of the group, designate a corporation described in paragraph 
(d)(1)(i)(A) of this section to act as the substitute agent. The 
Commissioner will notify the designated substitute agent in writing of 
its designation, and the designation is effective upon receipt by the 
designated substitute agent of such notice. The designated substitute 
agent must give notice of the designation to each corporation that was a 
member of the group during any part of the consolidated return year, but 
a failure by the designated substitute agent to notify any such member 
of the group does not invalidate the designation.
    (ii) At the request of any member, the Commissioner may, but is not 
required to, replace a substitute agent previously designated under 
paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section with another corporation described 
in paragraph (d)(1)(i)(A) of this section.
    (4) Absence of designation or notification of default substitute 
agent. Until a designation of a substitute agent for the group under 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section has become effective, the Commissioner 
has received notification in

[[Page 473]]

accordance with procedures established by the Commissioner that a 
successor qualifying under paragraph (d)(2) of this section has become 
the substitute agent by default, or the Commissioner has designated a 
substitute agent under paragraph (d)(3) of this section--
    (i) Any notice of deficiency or other communication mailed to the 
common parent, even if no longer in existence, is considered as having 
been properly mailed to the agent for the group; and
    (ii) The Commissioner is not required to act on any communication 
(including, for example, a claim for refund) submitted on behalf of the 
group by any person other than the common parent (including a successor 
of the common parent qualifying as a default substitute agent under 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section).
    (e) Termination of a corporation's existence--(1) In general. For 
purposes of paragraphs (a)(1)(v), (a)(4)(i), and (d) of this section, 
the existence of a corporation is deemed to terminate if--
    (i) Its existence terminates under applicable law; or
    (ii) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, it 
becomes, for Federal tax purposes, either--
    (A) An entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from its 
owner; or
    (B) An entity that is reclassified as a partnership.
    (2) Purported agency. If the existence of the agent for the group 
terminates under circumstances described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this 
section, until the Commissioner has approved the designation of a 
substitute agent for the group pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section or the Commissioner designates a substitute agent and notifies 
the designated substitute agent pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) of this 
section, any post-termination action by that purported agent on behalf 
of the group has the same effect, to the extent necessary to avoid 
prejudice to the Commissioner, as if the agent's corporate existence had 
not terminated.
    (3) Exceptions where no eligible corporation exists. (i) For 
purposes of the common parent's term as agent under paragraph (a)(4)(i) 
of this section and the term as agent of the substitute agent designated 
under paragraph (d) of this section, if a corporation either becomes 
disregarded as an entity separate from its owner or is reclassified as a 
partnership for Federal tax purposes, its existence is not deemed to 
terminate if the effect of such termination would be that no corporation 
remains eligible to serve as the substitute agent for the group's 
consolidated return year.
    (ii) Similarly, for purposes of paragraph (d) of this section, an 
entity that is either disregarded as an entity separate from its owner 
or reclassified as a partnership for Federal tax purposes is not 
precluded from designation as a substitute agent merely because of such 
classification if the effect of the inability to make such designation 
would be that no corporation remains eligible to serve as the substitute 
agent for the group's consolidated return year.
    (iii) Any entity described in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) or (ii) of this 
section that remains or becomes the agent for the group is treated as a 
corporation for purposes of this section.
    (4) Exception for section 338 transactions. Notwithstanding section 
338(a)(2), a target corporation for which an election is made under 
section 338 is not deemed to terminate for purposes of this section.
    (f) Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of 
this section. Unless otherwise indicated, each example addresses the 
question of which corporation is the proper party to execute a consent 
to waive the statute of limitations for Years 1 and 2 or the more 
general question of which corporation may be designated as a substitute 
agent for the group for Years 1 and 2. In each example, as of January 1 
of Year 1, the P group consists of P and its two subsidiaries, S and S-
1. P, as the common parent of the P group, files consolidated returns 
for the P group in Years 1 and 2. On January 1 of Year 1, domestic 
corporations S-2, U, V, W, W-1, X, Y, Z and Z-1 are not related to P or 
the members of the P group. All corporations are calendar year 
taxpayers. For none of the tax years at issue does the Commissioner 
exercise the authority under paragraph (a)(6) of this section to deal 
with any member separately. Any surviving corporation in a merger is a 
successor as

[[Page 474]]

described in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section. Any notification to 
the Commissioner of the designation of the P group's substitute agent 
also contains a statement signed on behalf of the designated agent that 
it agrees to act as the group's substitute agent and, in the case of a 
successor, that it is primarily liable as a successor of a member. The 
examples are as follows:

    Example 1. Disposition of all group members. On December 31 of Year 
1, P sells all the stock of S-1 to X. On December 31 of Year 2, P 
distributes all the stock of S to P's shareholders. P files a separate 
return for Year 3. Although P is no longer a common parent after Year 2, 
P remains the agent for the P group for Years 1 and 2. For as long as P 
remains in existence, only P may execute a waiver of the period of 
limitations on assessment on behalf of the group for Years 1 and 2.
    Example 2. Acquisition of common parent by another group. The facts 
are the same as in Example 1, except on January 1 of Year 3, all of the 
outstanding stock of P is acquired by Y. P thereafter joins in the Y 
group consolidated return as a member of Y group. Although P is a member 
of Y group in Year 3, P remains the agent for the P group for Years 1 
and 2. For as long as P remains in existence, only P may execute a 
waiver of the period of limitations on assessment on behalf of the P 
group for Years 1 and 2.
    Example 3. Merger of common parent--designation of remaining member 
as substitute agent. On December 31 of Year 1, P sells all the stock of 
S-1 to X. On July 1 of Year 2, P acquires all the stock of S-2. On 
November 30 of Year 2, P distributes all the stock of S to P's 
shareholders. On January 1 of Year 3, P merges into Y corporation. Just 
before the merger, P notifies the Commissioner in writing of the planned 
merger and of its designation of S as the substitute agent for the P 
group for Years 1 and 2. S is the only member that P can designate as 
the substitute agent for both Years 1 and 2 because it is the only 
subsidiary that was a member of the P group during part of both years. 
Although S-2 is the only remaining subsidiary of the P group when P 
merges into Y, S-2 was a member of the P group only in Year 2. For that 
reason, S-2 cannot be the substitute agent for the P group for Year 1. 
Alternatively, P could designate a different substitute agent for each 
year, selecting S or S-1 as the substitute agent for Year 1, and S or S-
2 as the substitute agent for Year 2. P could also designate its 
successor Y as the substitute agent for both Years 1 and 2.
    Example 4. Forward triangular merger of common parent. On January 1 
of Year 3, P merges with and into Z-1, a subsidiary of Z, in a forward 
triangular merger described in section 368(a)(1)(A) and (a)(2)(D). The 
transaction constitutes a reverse acquisition under Sec. 1.1502-
75(d)(3)(i) because P's shareholders receive more than 50% of Z's stock 
in exchange for all of P's stock. Just before the merger, P notifies the 
Commissioner in writing of the planned merger and its designation of Z-
1, the corporation that will survive the planned merger, as the 
substitute agent of the P group for Years 1 and 2. Because Z-1 will be 
P's successor (within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1) of this section) 
after the planned merger, P may designate Z-1 as the substitute agent 
for the P group for Years 1 and 2, pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section. Alternatively, P could have designated S or S-1 as the 
substitute agent for the P group for Years 1 and 2. Although Z is the 
new common parent of the P group, which continues pursuant to Sec. 
1.1502-75(d)(3)(i), P may not designate Z as the substitute agent for 
Years 1 and 2 because Z was not a member of the group during any part of 
Years 1 or 2 and is not a successor of P or any other member of P group.
    Example 5. Reverse triangular merger of common parent. On March 1 of 
Year 3, W-1, a subsidiary of W, merges into P, in a reverse triangular 
merger described in section 368(a)(1)(A) and (a)(2)(E). P survives the 
merger with W-1. The transaction constitutes a reverse acquisition under 
Sec. 1.1502-75(d)(3)(i) because P's shareholders receive more than 50% 
of W's stock in exchange for all of P's stock. Under paragraph (a) of 
this section, P remains the agent for the P group for Years 1 and 2, 
even though the P group continues with W as its new common parent 
pursuant to Sec. 1.1502-75(d)(3)(i). Because the transaction 
constitutes a reverse acquisition, the P group is treated as remaining 
in existence with W as its common parent. Before March 2 of Year 3, P is 
the agent for the P group for Year 3. Beginning on March 2 of Year 3, W 
becomes the agent for the P group with respect to all of Year 3 
(including the period through March 1) and subsequent consolidated 
return years. For as long as P remains in existence, P remains the agent 
of the P group under paragraph (a) of this section for Years 1 and 2, 
and therefore only P may execute a waiver of the period of limitations 
on assessment on behalf of the P group for Years 1 and 2.
    Example 6. Reverse triangular merger of common parent-subsequent 
spinoff of common parent. The facts are the same as in Example 5, except 
that on April 1 of Year 4, in a transaction unrelated to the Year 3 
reverse acquisition, P distributes the stock of its subsidiaries S and 
S-1 to W, and W then distributes the stock of P to the W shareholders. 
Beginning on March 2 of Year 3, W becomes the agent for the P group with 
respect to Year 3 (including the period through March 1) and subsequent 
consolidated return years. Although P is no longer a member of the P

[[Page 475]]

group after the Year 4 spinoff, P remains the agent for the P group 
under paragraph (a) of this section for Years 1 and 2. Thus, for as long 
as P remains in existence, only P may execute a waiver of the period of 
limitations on assessment on behalf of the P group for Years 1 and 2.
    Example 7. Qualified stock purchase and section 338 election. On 
March 31 of Year 2, V purchases the stock of P in a qualified stock 
purchase (within the meaning of section 338(d)(3)), and V makes a timely 
election pursuant to section 338(g) with respect to P. Although section 
338(a)(2) provides that P is treated as a new corporation as of the 
beginning of the day after the acquisition date for purposes of subtitle 
A, paragraph (e)(4) of this section provides that P's existence is not 
deemed to terminate for purposes of this section notwithstanding the 
general rule of section 338(a)(2). Therefore, the election under section 
338(g) does not result in a termination of P under paragraph (e) of this 
section, and new P remains the agent of the P group for Year 1 and the 
period ending March 31 of Year 2 (short Year 2). For as long as new P 
remains in existence, only new P may execute a waiver of the period of 
limitations on assessment on behalf of the P group for Year 1 and short 
Year 2.
    Example 8. Fraudulent conveyance of assets. On March 15 of Year 2, P 
files a consolidated return that includes the income of S and S-1 for 
Year 1. On December 1 of Year 2, S-1 transfers assets having a fair 
market value of $100x to U in exchange for $10x. This transfer of assets 
for less than fair market value constitutes a fraudulent conveyance 
under applicable state law. On March 1 of Year 5, P executes a waiver 
extending to December 31 of Year 6 the period of limitations on 
assessment with respect to the group's Year 1 consolidated return. On 
February 1 of Year 6, the Commissioner issues a notice of deficiency to 
P asserting a deficiency of $30x for the P group's Year 1 consolidated 
tax liability. P does not file a petition for redetermination in the Tax 
Court, and the Commissioner makes a timely assessment against the P 
group. P, S and S-1 are all insolvent and are unable to pay the 
deficiency. On February 1 of Year 8, the Commissioner sends a notice of 
transferee liability to U, which does not file a petition in the Tax 
Court. On August 1 of Year 8, the Commissioner assesses the amount of 
the P group's deficiency against U. Under section 6901(c), the 
Commissioner may assess U's transferee liability within one year after 
the expiration of the period of limitations against the transferor S-1. 
By operation of section 6213(a) and 6503(a), the issuance of the notice 
of deficiency to P and the expiration of the 90-day period for filing a 
petition in the Tax Court have the effect of further extending by 150 
days the P group's limitations period on assessment from the previously 
extended date of December 31 of Year 6 to May 30 of Year 7. Pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(1)(v) of this section, the waiver executed by P on March 1 
of Year 5 to extend the period of limitations on assessment to December 
31 of Year 6 and the further extension of the P group's limitations 
period to May 30 of Year 7 (by operation of sections 6213(a) and 
6503(a)) have the derivative effect of extending the period of 
limitations on assessment of U's transferee liability to May 30 of Year 
8. By operation of section 6901(f), the issuance of the notice of 
transferee liability to U and the expiration of the 90-day period for 
filing a petition in the Tax Court have the effect of further extending 
the limitations period on assessment of U's liability as a transferee by 
150 days, from May 30 of Year 8 to October 27 of Year 8. Accordingly, 
the Commissioner may send a notice of transferee liability to U at any 
time on or before May 30 of Year 8 and assess the unpaid liability 
against U at any time on or before October 27 of Year 8. The result 
would be the same even if S-1 ceased to exist before March 1 of Year 5, 
the date P executed the waiver.

    (g) Cross-reference. For further rules applicable to groups that 
include insolvent financial institutions, see Sec. 301.6402-7 of this 
chapter.

    (h) Effective date--(1) Application--(i) In general. This section 
applies with respect to taxable years beginning on or after June 28, 
2002.

    (ii) Election to apply for prior taxable years. Notwithstanding 
paragraphs (h)(1)(i) and (h)(2) of this section, the common parent may 
elect to apply paragraph (d)(1) of this section in lieu of Sec. 1.1502-
77A(d) in designating a substitute agent for taxable years beginning 
before June 28, 2002. The common parent makes such an election by 
expressly referring to the election under this paragraph (h)(1)(ii) in 
notifying the Commissioner of the designation of the substitute agent. 
Once made, such election applies to any subsequent designation of a 
substitute agent for the consolidated return year(s) subject to the 
election.

    (2) Prior law. For taxable years beginning before June 28, 2002, see 
Sec. 1.1502-77A.

Sec. 1.1502-78  Tentative carryback adjustments.

    (a) General rule. If a group has a consolidated net operating loss, 
a consolidated net capital loss, or a consolidated unused business 
credit for any taxable year, then any application under section 6411 for 
a tentative carryback adjustment of the taxes for a consolidated return 
year or years preceding such year shall be made by the common parent 
corporation for the carryback year (or substitute agent designated under 
Sec. 1.1502-77(d) for the carryback year) to the extent such loss or 
unused business credit is not apportioned to a corporation for a 
separate return year pursuant to Sec. 1.1502-21(b), 1.1502-22(b), or 
1.1502-79(c). In the case of the portion of a consolidated net operating 
loss or consolidated net capital loss or consolidated unused business 
credit to which the preceding sentence does not apply and that is to be 
carried back to a corporation that was not a member of a consolidated 
group in the carryback year, the corporation to which such loss or 
credit is attributable shall make any application under section 6411. In 
the case of a net capital loss or net operating loss or unused business 
credit arising in a separate return year that may be carried back to a 
consolidated return year, after taking into account the application of 
Sec. 1.1502-21(b)(3)(ii)(B) with respect to any net operating loss 
arising in another consolidated group, the common parent for the 
carryback year (or substitute agent designated under Sec. 1.1502-77(d) 
for the carryback year) shall make any application under section 6411.
    (b) Special rules--(1) Payment of refund. Any refund allowable under 
an application referred to in paragraph (a) of this section shall be 
made directly to and in the name of the corporation filing the 
application, except that in all cases where a loss is deducted from the 
consolidated taxable income or a credit is allowed in computing the 
consolidated tax liability for a consolidated return year, any refund 
shall be made directly to and in the name of the common parent 
corporation for the carryback year (or substitute agent designated under 
Sec. 1.1502-77(d) for the carryback year). The payment of any such 
refund shall discharge any liability of the Government with respect to 
such refund.
    (2) Several liability. If a group filed a consolidated return for a 
taxable year for which there was an adjustment by reason of an 
application under section 6411, and if a deficiency is assessed against 
such group under section 6213(b)(3), then each member of such group 
shall be severally liable for such deficiency including any interest or 
penalty assessed in connection with such deficiency.
    (3) Groups that include insolvent financial institutions. For 
further rules applicable to groups that include insolvent financial 
institutions, see Sec. 301.6402-7 of this chapter.
    (c) Examples. The provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section may be illustrated by the following examples:

    Example (1). Corporations P, S, and S-1 filed a consolidated return 
for the calendar year 1966. P, S, and S-1 also filed a consolidated 
return for the calendar year 1969. The group incurred a consolidated net 
operating loss in 1969 attributable to S-1 which may be carried back to 
1966 as a consolidated net operating loss carryback. If a tentative 
carryback adjustment is desired, P, the common parent for the carryback 
year, must file an application under section 6411 and any refund will be 
made to P.
    Example (2). Assume the same facts as in example (1) except that P, 
S, and S-1 filed separate returns for the calendar year 1969, even 
though they were members of the same group for such year. P incurred a 
net operating loss in 1969 which may be carried back to 1966. If a 
tentative carryback adjustment is desired, P must file an application 
under section 6411 and any refund from such application will be made to 
P.
    Example (3). Corporations X, Y, and Z filed a consolidated return 
for the calendar year 1966. Z ceased to be a member of the group in 
1967. Z filed a separate return for 1968 while X and Y filed a 
consolidated return for such year. The group incurred a consolidated net 
operating loss in 1968 attributable to Y, which may be carried back to 
1966. Z also incurred a net operating loss for 1968 which may be carried 
back to 1966. If a tentative carryback adjustment is claimed with 
respect to the consolidated net operating loss, X, the common parent, 
must file an application under section 6411. If a tentative carryback 
adjustment is desired with respect to Z's loss, X must file an 
application. Any refunds attributable to either application will be made 
to X. If an assessment is made

[[Page 477]]

under section 6213(b)(3) to recover an excessive tentative allowance 
made with respect to calendar year 1966, X, Y, and Z are severally 
liable for such assessment.
    Example (4). Corporations L and M filed a consolidated return for 
the calendar year 1966. Corporation N filed a separate return for such 
year. Later, N became a member of the group and filed a consolidated 
return with the group for the calendar year 1968. The group incurred a 
consolidated net operating loss in 1968 attributable to N which may be 
carried back to N's separate return for 1966. If a tentative carryback 
adjustment is desired, N must file an application under section 6411 and 
any refund will be made directly to N.

    (d) Adjustments of overpayments of estimated income tax. If a group 
paid its estimated income tax on a consolidated basis, then any 
application under section 6425 for an adjustment of overpayment of 
estimated income tax shall be made by the common parent corporation. If 
the members of a group paid estimated income taxes on a separate basis, 
then any application under section 6425 shall be made by the member of 
the group which claims an overpayment on a separate basis. Any refund 
allowable under an application under section 6425 shall be made directly 
to and in the name of the corporation filing the application.
    (e) Time for filing application--(1) General rule. The provisions of 
section 6411(a) apply to the filing of an application for a tentative 
carryback adjustment by a consolidated group.
    (2) Special rule for new members--(i) New member. A new member is a 
corporation that, in the preceding taxable year, did not qualify as a 
member, as defined in Sec. 1.1502-1(b), of the consolidated group that 
it now joins.
    (ii) End of taxable year. Solely for the purpose of complying with 
the twelve-month requirement for making an application for a tentative 
carryback adjustment under section 6411(a), the separate return year of 
a qualified new member shall be treated as ending on the same date as 
the end of the current taxable year of the consolidated group that the 
qualified new member joins.
    (iii) Qualified new member. A new member of a consolidated group 
qualifies for purposes of the provisions of this paragraph (e)(2) if, 
immediately prior to becoming a new member, either--
    (A) It was the common parent of a consolidated group; or
    (B) It was not required to join in the filing of a consolidated 
return.
    (iv) Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (e)(2) may be 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. Individual A owns 100 percent of the stock of X, a 
corporation that is not a member of a consolidated group and files 
separate tax returns on a calendar year basis. On January 31 of year 1, 
X becomes a member of the Y consolidated group, which also files returns 
on a calendar year basis. X is a qualified new member as defined in 
paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(B) of this section because, immediately prior to 
becoming a new member of the Y consolidated group, X was not required to 
join in the filing of a consolidated return. As a result of its becoming 
a new member of Group Y, X's separate return for the short taxable year 
(January 1 of year 1 through January 31 of year 1) is due September 15 
of year 2 (with extensions). See Sec. 1.1502-76(c). Group Y's 
consolidated return is also due September 15 of year 2 (with 
extensions). See Sec. 1.1502-76(c). Solely for the purpose of complying 
with the twelve-month requirement for making an application for a 
tentative carryback adjustment under section 6411(a), X's taxable year 
for the separate return year is treated as ending on December 31 of year 
1. X's application for a tentative carryback adjustment is therefore due 
on or before December 31 of year 2.

    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example 1 except that 
immediately prior to becoming a new member of Group Y, X was a member of 
the Z consolidated group. Because X was required to join in the filing 
of the consolidated return for Group Z, X is not a qualified new member 
as defined in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section. X's items for the 
one-month period will be included in the consolidated return for Group 
Z. Group Z's application for a tentative carryback adjustment, if any, 
continues to be due within 12 months of the end of its taxable year, 
which is not affected by X's change in status as a new member of Group 
Y.

    (f) Effective date--(1) In general. This section applies to taxable 
years to which a loss or credit may be carried back and for which the 
due date (without extensions) of the original return is after June 28, 
2002, except that the provisions of paragraph (e)(2) apply for 
applications by new members of consolidated groups for tentative 
carryback

[[Page 478]]

adjustments resulting from net operating losses, net capital losses, or 
unused business credits arising in separate return years of new members 
that begin on or after January 1, 2001.
    (2) Prior law. For taxable years to which a loss or credit may be 
carried back and for which the due date (without extensions) of the 
original return is on or before June 28, 2002, see Sec. 1.1502-78 in 
effect prior to June 28, 2002, as contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised 
April 1, 2002.

Sec. 1.1502-79  Separate return years.

    (a) Carryover and carryback of consolidated net operating losses to 
separate return years. For losses arising in consolidated return years 
beginning before January 1, 1997, see Sec. 1.1502-79A(a). For later 
years, see Sec. 1.1502-21(b).
    (b) Carryover and carryback of consolidated net capital loss to 
separate return years. For losses arising in consolidated return years 
beginning before January 1, 1997, see Sec. 1.1502-79A(b). For later 
years, see Sec. 1.1502-22(b).
    (c) Carryover and carryback of consolidated unused investment credit 
to separate return years--(1) In general. If a consolidated unused 
investment credit can be carried under the principles of section 46(b) 
and paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.1502-3 to a separate return year of a 
corporation (or could have been so carried if such corporation were in 
existence) which was a member of the group in the year in which such 
unused credit arose, then the portion of such consolidated unused credit 
attributable to such corporation (as determined under subparagraph (2) 
of this paragraph) shall be apportioned to such corporation (and any 
successor to such corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) 
applies) under the principles of Sec. 1.1502-21(b) (or Sec. Sec. 
1.1502-79A(a)(1) and (2), as appropriate) and shall be an investment 
credit carryover or carryback to such separate return year.
    (2) Portion of consolidated unused investment credit attributable to 
a member--(i) Investment credit carryback. In the case of a consolidated 
unused credit which is an investment credit carryback, the portion of 
such consolidated unused credit attributable to a member of the group is 
an amount equal to such consolidated unused credit multiplied by a 
fraction, the numerator of which is the credit earned of such member for 
the consolidated unused credit year, and the denominator of which is the 
consolidated credit earned for such unused credit year.
    (ii) Investment credit carryover. In the case of a consolidated 
unused credit which is an investment credit carryover, the portion of 
such consolidated unused credit attributable to a member of the group is 
an amount equal to such consolidated unused credit multiplied by a 
fraction, the numerator of which is the credit earned with respect to 
any section 38 property placed in service in the consolidated unused 
credit year and owned by such member (whether or not placed in service 
by such member) at the close of the last day as of which the taxable 
income of such member is included in a consolidated return filed by the 
group, and the denominator of which is the consolidated credit earned 
for such unused credit year.
    (d) Carryover and carryback of consolidated unused foreign tax--(1) 
In general. If a consolidated unused foreign tax can be carried under 
the principles of section 904(d) and paragraph (e) of Sec. 1.1502-4 to 
a separate return year of a corporation (or could have been so carried 
if such corporation were in existence) which was a member of the group 
in the year in which such unused foreign tax arose, then the portion of 
such consolidated unused foreign tax attributable to such corporation 
(as determined under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph) shall be 
apportioned to such corporation (and any successor to such corporation 
in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies) under the principles 
of Sec. 1.1502-21(b) (or Sec. Sec. 1.1502-79A(a)(1) and (2), as 
appropriate) and shall be deemed paid or accrued in such separate return 
year to the extent provided in section 904(d).

[[Page 479]]

    (2) Portion of consolidated unused foreign tax attributable to a 
member. The portion of a consolidated unused foreign tax for any year 
attributable to a member of a group is an amount equal to such 
consolidated unused foreign tax multipled by a fraction, the numerator 
of which is the foreign taxes paid or accrued for such year (including 
those taxes deemed paid or accrued, other than by reason of section 
904(d)) to each foreign country or possession (or to all foreign 
countries or possessions if the overall limitation is effective) by such 
member, and the denominator of which is the aggregate of all such taxes 
paid or accrued for such year (including those taxes deemed paid or 
accrued, other than by reason of section 904(d)) to each such foreign 
country or possession (or to all foreign countries or possessions if the 
overall limitation is effective) by all the members of the group.
    (e) Carryover of consolidated excess charitable contributions to 
separate return years--(1) In general. If the consolidated excess 
charitable contributions for any taxable year can be carried under the 
principles of section 170(b)(2) and paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.1502-24 to 
a separate return year of a corporation (or could have been so carried 
if such corporation were in existence) which was a member of the group 
in the year in which such excess contributions arose, then the portion 
of such consolidated excess charitable contributions attributable to 
such corporation (as determined under subparagraph (2) of this 
paragraph) shall be apportioned to such corporation (and any successor 
to such corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies) 
under the principles of Sec. 1.1502-21(b) (or Sec. Sec. 1.1502-
79A(a)(1) and (2), as appropriate) and shall be a charitable 
contribution carryover to such separate return year.
    (2) Portion of consolidated excess charitable contributions 
attributable to a member. The portion of the consolidated excess 
charitable contributions attributable to a member of a group is an 
amount equal to such consolidated excess contributions multiplied by a 
fraction, the numerator of which is the charitable contributions paid by 
such member for the taxable year, and the denominator of which is the 
aggregate of all such charitable contributions paid for such year by all 
the members of the group.

Sec. 1.1502-80  Applicability of other provisions of law.

    (a) In general. The Internal Revenue Code, or other law, shall be 
applicable to the group to the extent the regulations do not exclude its 
application. Thus, for example, in a transaction to which section 381(a) 
applies, the acquiring corporation will succeed to the tax attributes 
described in section 381(c). Furthermore, sections 269 and 482 apply for 
any consolidated year. Section 304 applies except as provided in 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) Non-applicability of section 304. Section 304 does not apply to 
any acquisition of stock of a corporation in an intercompany transaction 
or to any intercompany item from such transaction occurring on or after 
July 24, 1991.
    (c) Deferral of section 165. For consolidated return years beginning 
on or after January 1, 1995, stock of a member is not treated as 
worthless under section 165 before the stock is treated as disposed of 
under the principles of Sec. 1.1502-19(c)(1)(iii). See Sec. Sec. 
1.1502-11(c) and 1.1502-35T for additional rules relating to stock loss. 
For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1502-80T(c).
    (d) Non-applicability of section 357(c)--(1) In general. Section 
357(c) does not apply to any transaction to which Sec. 1.1502-13, Sec. 
1.1502-13T, Sec. 1.1502-14, or Sec. 1.1502-14T applies, if it occurs 
in a consolidated return year beginning on or after January 1, 1995. For 
example, P, S, and T are members of a consolidated group, P owns all of 
the stock of S and T with bases of $30 and $20, respectively, S has a 
$30 basis in its assets and $40 of liabilities, and S merges into T in a 
transaction described in section 368(a)(1)(A) (and in section 
368(a)(1)(D)); section 357(c) does not apply to the merger, P's basis in 
T's stock increases to $50 ($30 plus $20), and

[[Page 480]]

T succeeds to S's $30 basis in the assets transferred subject to the $40 
liability. Similarly, if S instead transferred its assets and 
liabilities to a newly formed subsidiary in a transaction to which 
section 351 applies, section 357(c) does not apply and S's basis in the 
subsidiary's stock is a $10 excess loss account. This paragraph (d) does 
not apply to a transaction if the transferor or transferee becomes a 
nonmember as part of the same plan or arrangement. The transferor (or 
transferee) is treated as becoming a nonmember once it is no longer a 
member of a consolidated group that includes the transferee (or 
transferor). For purposes of this paragraph (d), any reference to a 
transferor or transferee includes, as the context may require, a 
reference to a successor or predecessor.
    (2) Prior period transactions. If, in a tax year beginning before 
January 1, 1995, a member's stock with an excess loss account is 
transferred in a transaction to which Sec. 1.1502-13, Sec. 1.1502-13T, 
Sec. 1.1502-14, or Sec. 1.1502-14T applies, paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section applies to the stock transfer to the extent that the income, 
gain, deduction, or loss (if any) is not taken into account in a tax 
year beginning before January 1, 1995. For example, if P, S, and T, are 
members of a consolidated group, T's stock has an excess loss account, 
and P transfers the T stock to S in 1993 in a transaction to which 
section 351 and Sec. 1.1502-13 apply, section 357(c) applies to the 
transfer only to the extent P's gain is taken into account in tax years 
beginning before January 1, 1995.
    (e) Non-applicability of section 163(e)(5). Section 163(e)(5) does 
not apply to any intercompany obligation (within the meaning of Sec. 
1.1502-13(g)) issued in a consolidated return year beginning on or after 
July 12, 1995.
    (f) Non-applicability of section 1031. Section 1031 does not apply 
to any intercompany transaction occurring in consolidated return years 
beginning on or after July 12, 1995.

    (a) and (b) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1502-80(a) 
and (b).
    (c) Deferral of section 165. Stock of a member is not treated as 
worthless under section 165 before the stock is treated as disposed of 
under the principles of Sec. 1.1502-19(c)(1)(iii). If stock of a member 
would otherwise be treated as worthless under the principles of section 
165, then, notwithstanding the previous sentence, such stock may be 
treated as worthless under section 165 immediately prior to the time 
such member ceases to be a member of the group. See Sec. Sec. 1.1502-
11(c) and 1.1502-35T for additional rules relating to stock loss. This 
paragraph (c) applies to taxable years beginning after March 18, 2004 
and before March 19, 2007. Taxpayers, however, may apply this paragraph 
(c) to taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 1995 and before 
March 18, 2004; otherwise, paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.1502-80 as contained 
in 26 CFR part 1 edition revised as of April 1, 2003, shall apply to 
taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 1995, and on or before 
March 18, 2004.

Sec. 1.1502-81T  Alaska Native Corporations.

    (a) General Rule. The application of section 60(b)(5) of the Tax 
Reform Act of 1984 and section 1804(e)(4) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 
(relating to Native Corporations established under the Alaska Native 
Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.)) is limited to the use on 
a consolidated return of losses and credits of a Native Corporation, and 
of a corporation all of whose stock is owned directly by a Native 
Corporation, during any taxable year (beginning after the effective date 
of such sections and before 1992), or any part thereof, against the 
income and tax liability of a corporation affiliated with the Native 
Corporation. Thus, no other tax saving, tax benefit, or tax loss is 
intended to result from the application of section 60(b)(5) of the Tax 
Reform Act of 1984 and section 1804(e)(4) of the

[[Page 481]]

Tax Reform Act of 1986 to any person (whether or not such person is a 
member of an affiliated group of which a Native Corporation is the 
common parent). In particular, except as approved by the Secretary, no 
positive adjustment under Sec. 1.1502-32(b) will be made with respect 
to the basis of stock of a corporation that is affiliated with a Native 
Corporation through application of section 60(b)(5) of the Tax Reform 
Act of 1984 and section 1804(e)(4) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
    (b) Effective Dates. This section applies to taxable years beginning 
after December 31, 1984.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1502-91  Application of section 382 with respect to a consolidated group.

    (a) Determination and effect of an ownership change--(1) In general. 
This section and Sec. Sec. 1.1502-92 and 1.1502-93 set forth the rules 
for determining an ownership change under section 382 for members of 
consolidated groups and the section 382 limitations with respect to 
attributes described in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section. These 
rules generally provide that an ownership change and the section 382 
limitation are determined with respect to these attributes for the group 
(or loss subgroup) on a single entity basis and not for its members 
separately. Following an ownership change of a loss group (or a loss 
subgroup) under Sec. 1.1502-92, the amount of consolidated taxable 
income for any post-change year which may be offset by pre-change 
consolidated attributes (or pre-change subgroup attributes) shall not 
exceed the consolidated section 382 limitation (or subgroup section 382 
limitation) for such year as determined under Sec. 1.1502-93.
    (2) Special rule for post-change year that includes the change date. 
If the post-change year includes the change date, section 382(b)(3)(A) 
is applied so that the consolidated section 382 limitation (or subgroup 
section 382 limitation) does not apply to the portion of consolidated 
taxable income that is allocable to the period in the year on or before 
the change date. See generally Sec. 1.382-6 (relating to the allocation 
of income and loss). The allocation of consolidated taxable income for 
the post-change year that includes the change date must be made before 
taking into account any consolidated net operating loss deduction (as 
defined in Sec. 1.1502-21(a)).
    (3) Cross-reference. See Sec. Sec. 1.1502-94 and 1.1502-95 for 
rules that apply section 382 to a corporation that becomes or ceases to 
be a member of a group or loss subgroup.
    (b) Definitions and nomenclature. For purposes of this section and 
Sec. Sec. 1.1502-92 through 1.1502-99, unless otherwise stated:
    (1) The definitions and nomenclature contained in section 382 and 
the regulations thereunder (including the nomenclature and assumptions 
relating to

[[Page 484]]

the examples in Sec. 1.382-2T(b)) and this section and Sec. Sec. 
1.1502-92 through 1.1502-99 apply.
    (2) In all examples, all groups file consolidated returns, all 
corporations file their income tax returns on a calendar year basis, the 
only 5-percent shareholder of a corporation is a public group, the facts 
set forth the only owner shifts during the testing period, no election 
is made under paragraph (d)(4) of this section, and each asset of a 
corporation has a value equal to its adjusted basis.
    (3) As the context requires, references to Sec. Sec. 1.1502-91 
through 1.1502-96 include references to corresponding provisions of 
Sec. Sec. 1.1502-A through 1.1502-96A. For example, a reference to an 
ownership change under Sec. 1.1502-92 in Sec. 1.1502-95(b) can include 
a reference to an ownership change under Sec. 1.1502-92A.
    (c) Loss group--(1) Defined. A loss group is a consolidated group 
that--
    (i) Is entitled to use a net operating loss carryover to the taxable 
year that did not arise (and is not treated under Sec. 1.1502-21(c) as 
arising) in a SRLY;
    (ii) Has a consolidated net operating loss for the taxable year in 
which a testing date of the common parent occurs (determined by treating 
the common parent as a loss corporation); or
    (iii) Has a net unrealized built-in loss (determined under paragraph 
(g) of this section by treating the date on which the determination is 
made as though it were a change date).
    (2) Coordination with rule that ends separate tracking. A 
consolidated group may be a loss group because a member's losses that 
arose in (or are treated as arising in) a SRLY are treated as described 
in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. See Sec. 1.1502-96(a).
    (3) Example. The following example illustrates the principles of 
this paragraph (c):
    Example. Loss group. (i) L and L1 file separate returns and each has 
a net operating loss carryover arising in Year 1 that is carried over to 
Year 2. A owns 40 shares and L owns 60 shares of the 100 outstanding 
shares of L1 stock. At the close of Year 1, L buys the 40 shares of L1 
stock from A. For Year 2, L and L1 file a consolidated return. The 
following is a graphic illustration of these facts:

[[Page 485]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR02JY99.000

    (ii) L and L1 become a loss group at the beginning of Year 2 because 
the group is entitled to use the Year 1 net operating loss carryover of 
L, the common parent, which did not arise (and is not treated under 
Sec. 1.1502-21(c) as arising) in a SRLY. See Sec. 1.1502-94 for rules 
relating to the application of section 382 with respect to L1's net 
operating loss

[[Page 486]]

carryover from Year 1 which did arise in a SRLY.
    (d) Loss subgroup--(1) Net operating loss carryovers. Two or more 
corporations that become members of a consolidated group (the current 
group) compose a loss subgroup if--
    (i) They were affiliated with each other in another group (the 
former group), whether or not the group was a consolidated group;
    (ii) They bear the relationship described in section 1504(a)(1) to 
each other through a loss subgroup parent immediately after they become 
members of the current group (or are deemed to bear that relationship as 
a result of an election described in paragraph (d)(4) of this section); 
and
    (iii) At least one of the members carries over a net operating loss 
that did not arise (and is not treated under Sec. 1.1502-21(c) as 
arising) in a SRLY with respect to the former group.
    (2) Net unrealized built-in loss. Two or more corporations that 
become members of a consolidated group compose a loss subgroup if they--
    (i) Have been continuously affiliated with each other for the 5 
consecutive year period ending immediately before they become members of 
the group;
    (ii) Bear the relationship described in section 1504(a)(1) to each 
other through a loss subgroup parent immediately after they become 
members of the current group (or are deemed to bear that relationship as 
a result of an election described in paragraph (d)(4) of this section); 
and
    (iii) Have a net unrealized built-in loss (determined under 
paragraph (g) of this section on the day they become members of the 
group by treating that day as though it were a change date).
    (3) Loss subgroup parent. A loss subgroup parent is the corporation 
that bears the same relationship to the other members of the loss 
subgroup as a common parent bears to the members of a group.
    (4) Election to treat loss subgroup parent requirement as 
satisfied--(i) In general. Solely for purposes of paragraphs (d)(1)(i) 
and (2)(ii) of this section, two or more corporations that become 
members of a consolidated group at the same time and that were 
affiliated with each other immediately before becoming members of the 
group are deemed to bear a section 1504(a)(1) relationship to each other 
immediately after they become members of the group if the common parent 
of that group makes an election under this paragraph (d)(4) with respect 
to those members. See Sec. 1.1502-96(e) for the time and manner of 
making the election.
    (ii) Members included. An election under this paragraph (d)(4) 
includes all corporations that become members of the current group at 
the same time and that were affiliated with each other immediately 
before they become members of the current group.
    (iii) Each member included treated as loss subgroup parent. If the 
members to which this election applies are a loss subgroup described in 
paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section, then each member is treated as 
a loss subgroup parent. See Sec. 1.1502-92(b)(1)(iii) for special rules 
relating to an ownership change of a loss subgroup if the election under 
this paragraph (d)(4) is made.
    (5) Principal purpose of avoiding a limitation. The corporations 
described in paragraphs (d)(1) or (2) of this section do not compose a 
loss subgroup if any one of them is formed, acquired, or availed of with 
a principal purpose of avoiding the application of, or increasing any 
limitation under, section 382. Instead, Sec. 1.1502-94 applies with 
respect to the attributes of each such corporation. Any member excluded 
from a loss subgroup, if excluded with a principal purpose of so 
avoiding or increasing any section 382 limitation, is treated as 
included in the loss subgroup. This paragraph (d)(5) does not apply 
solely because, in connection with becoming members of the group, the 
members of a group (or loss subgroup) are rearranged (or, in the case of 
the preceding sentence, are not rearranged) to bear a relationship to 
the other members described in section 1504(a)(1).
    (6) Special rules. See Sec. 1.1502-95(d) for rules concerning when 
a corporation ceases to be a member of a loss subgroup, and for certain 
exceptions that may apply if a member does not continue to satisfy the 
loss subgroup parent requirement within the current group. See also 
Sec. 1.1502-96(a) for a special rule regarding the end of separate 
tracking of SRLY losses of a member

[[Page 487]]

that has an ownership change or that has been a member of a group for at 
least 5 consecutive years.
    (7) Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of 
this paragraph (d):
    Example 1. Loss subgroup. (i) P owns all the L stock and L owns all 
the L1 stock. The P group has a consolidated net operating loss arising 
in Year 1 that is carried to Year 2. On May 2, Year 2, P sells all the 
stock of L to A, and L and L1 thereafter file consolidated returns. A 
portion of the Year 1 consolidated net operating loss is apportioned 
under Sec. 1.1502-21(b) to each of L and L1, which they carry over to 
Year 2. The following is a graphic illustration of these facts:

[[Page 488]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR02JY99.001

    (ii) (a) L and L1 compose a loss subgroup within the meaning of 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section because--
    (A) They were affiliated with each other in the P group (the former 
group);
    (B) They bear a relationship described in section 1504(a)(1) to each 
other through a

[[Page 489]]

loss subgroup parent (L) immediately after they became members of the L 
group; and
    (C) At least one of the members (here, both L and L1) carries over a 
net operating loss to the L group (the current group) that did not arise 
in a SRLY with respect to the P group.
    (b) Under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, L is the loss subgroup 
parent of the L loss subgroup.
    Example 2. Loss subgroup--section 1504(a)(1) relationship. (i) P 
owns all the stock of L and L1. L owns all the stock of L2. L1 and L2 
own 40 percent and 60 percent of the stock of L3, respectively. The P 
group has a consolidated net operating loss arising in Year 1 that is 
carried over to Year 2. On May 22, Year 2, P sells all the stock of L 
and L1 to P1, the common parent of another consolidated group. The Year 
1 consolidated net operating loss is apportioned under Sec. 1.1502-
21(b), and each of L, L1, L2, and L3 carries over a portion of such loss 
to the first consolidated return year of the P1 group ending after the 
acquisition. The following is a graphic illustration of these facts:

[[Page 490]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR02JY99.002

    (ii) L and L2 compose a loss subgroup within the meaning of 
paragraph(d)(1) of this section. Neither L1 nor L3 is included in a loss 
subgroup because neither bears a relationship described in section 
1504(a)(1) through a loss subgroup parent to any other member of the 
former group immediately after becoming members of the P1 group.

[[Page 491]]

    Example 3. Loss subgroup--section 1504(a)(1) relationship. The facts 
are the same as in Example 2, except that the stock of L1 is transferred 
to L in connection with the sale of the L stock to P1. L, L1, L2, and L3 
compose a loss subgroup within the meaning of paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section because--
    (i) They were affiliated with each other in the P group (the former 
group);
    (ii) They bear a relationship described in section 1504(a)(1) to 
each other through a loss subgroup parent (L) immediately after they 
become members of the P1 group; and
    (iii) At least one of the members (here, each of L, L1, L2, and L3) 
carries over a net operating loss to the P1 group (the current group).
    Example 4. Loss subgroup--elective section 1504(a)(1) relationship. 
The facts are the same as in Example 2, except that P1 makes the 
election under paragraph (d)(4) of this section. The election includes 
L, L1, L2, and L3 (even though L and L2 would compose a loss subgroup 
without regard to the election) because they become members of the 
current group (the P1 group) at the same time and were affiliated with 
each other in the P group immediately before they became members of the 
P1 group. As a result of the election, L, L1, L2, and L3 are treated as 
satisfying the requirement that they bear the relationship described in 
section 1504(a)(1) to each other through a loss subgroup parent 
immediately after they become members of the P1 group. L, L1, L2, and L3 
compose a loss subgroup within the meaning of paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section.
    (e) Pre-change consolidated attribute--(1) Defined. A pre-change 
consolidated attribute of a loss group is--
    (i) Any loss described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (ii) of this 
section (relating to the definition of loss group) that is allocable to 
the period ending on or before the change date; and
    (ii) Any recognized built-in loss of the loss group.
    (2) Example. The following example illustrates the principle of this 
paragraph (e):
    Example. Pre-change consolidated attribute. (i) The L group has a 
consolidated net operating loss arising in Year 1 that is carried over 
to Year 2. The L loss group has an ownership change at the beginning of 
Year 2.
    (ii) The net operating loss carryover of the L loss group from Year 
1 is a pre-change consolidated attribute because the L group was 
entitled to use the loss in Year 2 and therefore the loss was described 
in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. Under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of 
this section, the amount of consolidated taxable income of the L group 
for Year 2 that may be offset by this loss carryover may not exceed the 
consolidated section 382 limitation of the L group for that year. See 
Sec. 1.1502-93 for rules relating to the computation of the 
consolidated section 382 limitation.
    (f) Pre-change subgroup attribute--(1) Defined. A pre-change 
subgroup attribute of a loss subgroup is--
    (i) Any net operating loss carryover described in paragraph 
(d)(1)(iii) of this section (relating to the definition of loss 
subgroup); and
    (ii) Any recognized built-in loss of the loss subgroup.
    (2) Example. The following example illustrates the principle of this 
paragraph (f):

    Pre-change subgroup attribute. (i) P is the common parent of a 
consolidated group. P owns all the stock of L, and L owns all the stock 
of L1. L2 is not a member of an affiliated group, and has a net 
operating loss arising in Year 1 that is carried over to Year 2. On 
December 11, Year 2, L1 acquires all the stock of L2, causing an 
ownership change of L2. During Year 2, the P group has a consolidated 
net operating loss that is carried over to Year 3. On November 2, Year 
3, M acquires all the L stock from P. M, L, L1, and L2 thereafter file 
consolidated returns. All of the P group Year 2 consolidated net 
operating loss is apportioned under Sec. 1.1502-21(b) to L and L2, 
which they carry over to the M group.
    (ii)(a) L, L1, and L2 compose a loss subgroup because--
    (1) They were affiliated with each other in the P group (the former 
group);
    (2) They bear a relationship described in section 1504(a)(1) to each 
other through a loss subgroup parent (L) immediately after they became 
members of the L group; and
    (3) At least one of the members (here, both L and L2) carries over a 
net operating loss to the M group (the current group) that is described 
in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (b) For this purpose, L2's loss from Year 1 that was a SRLY loss 
with respect to the P group (the former group) is described in paragraph 
(d)(1)(iii) of this section because L2 had an ownership change on 
becoming a member of the P group (see Sec. 1.1502-96(a)) on December 
11, Year 2. Starting on December 12, Year 2, the P group no longer 
separately tracked owner shifts of the stock of L1 with respect to the 
Year 1 loss. M's acquisition results in an ownership change of L, and 
therefore the L loss subgroup under Sec. 1.1502-92(a)(2). See Sec. 
1.1502-93 for rules governing the computation of the subgroup section 
382 limitation.
    (iii) In the M group, L2's Year 1 loss continues to be subject to a 
section 382 limitation resulting from the ownership change

[[Page 492]]

that occurred on December 11, Year 2. See Sec. 1.1502-96(c).

    (g) Net unrealized built-in gain and loss--(1) In general. The 
determination whether a consolidated group (or loss subgroup) has a net 
unrealized built-in gain or loss under section 382(h)(3) is based on the 
aggregate amount of the separately computed net unrealized built-in 
gains or losses of each member that is included in the group (or loss 
subgroup) under paragraph (g)(2) of this section, including items of 
built-in income and deduction described in section 382(h)(6). Thus, for 
example, amounts deferred under section 267, or under Sec. 1.1502-13 
(other than amounts deferred with respect to the stock of a member (or 
an intercompany obligation) included in the group (or loss subgroup) 
under paragraph (g)(2) of this section) are built-in items. The 
threshold requirement under section 382(h)(3)(B) applies on an aggregate 
basis and not on a member-by-member basis. The separately computed 
amount of a member included in a group or loss subgroup does not include 
any unrealized built-in gain or loss on stock (including stock described 
in section 1504(a)(4) and Sec. 1.382-2T(f)(18)(ii) and (iii)) of 
another member included in the group or loss subgroup (or an 
intercompany obligation). However, a member of a group or loss subgroup 
includes in its separately computed amount the unrealized built-in gain 
or loss on stock (but not on an intercompany obligation) of another 
member not included in the group or loss subgroup. If a member is not 
included in the determination whether a group (or subgroup) has a net 
unrealized built-in loss under paragraph (g)(2)(ii) or (iv) of this 
section, that member is not included in the loss group or loss subgroup. 
See Sec. 1.1502-94(c) (relating to built-in gain or loss of a new loss 
member) and Sec. 1.1502-96(a) (relating to the end of separate tracking 
of certain losses).
    (2) Members included--(i) Consolidated group with a net operating 
loss. The members included in the determination whether a consolidated 
group described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section (relating 
to loss groups with net operating losses) has a net unrealized built-in 
gain are all members of the consolidated group on the day that the 
determination is made.

    (ii) Determination whether a consolidated group has a net unrealized 
built-in loss. The members included in the determination whether a 
consolidated group is a loss group described in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of 
this section are--

    (A) The common parent and all other members that have been 
affiliated with the common parent for the 5 consecutive year period 
ending on the day that the determination is made;

    (B) Any other member that has a net unrealized built-in loss 
determined under paragraph (g)(1) of this section on the date that the 
determination is made, and that is neither a new loss member described 
in Sec. 1.1502-94(a)(1)(ii) nor a member of a loss subgroup described 
in paragraph (d)(2) of this section;

    (C) Any new loss member described in Sec. 1.1502-94(a)(1)(ii) that 
has a net unrealized built-in gain determined under paragraph (g)(1) of 
this section on the day that the determination is made; and

    (D) The members of a loss subgroup described in paragraph (d)(2) of 
this section if the members of the subgroup have, in the aggregate, a 
net unrealized built-in gain on the day that the determination is made.

    (iii) Loss subgroup with net operating loss carryovers. The members 
included in the determination whether a loss subgroup described in 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section (relating to loss subgroups with net 
operating loss carryovers) has a net unrealized built-in gain are all 
members of the loss subgroup on the day that the determination is made.

    (iv) Determination whether subgroup has a net unrealized built-in 
loss. The members included in the determination whether a subgroup has a 
net unrealized built-in loss are those members described in paragraphs 
(d)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.

    (v) Separate determination of section 382 limitation for recognized 
built-in losses and net operating losses. In determining

[[Page 493]]

whether a loss group described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (ii) of this 
section (relating to loss groups that have net operating loss 
carryovers) has a net unrealized built-in gain which, if recognized, 
increases the consolidated section 382 limitation, the group includes, 
under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section, all of its members on the day 
the determination is made. Under paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section, 
however, for purposes of determining whether a group has a net 
unrealized built-in loss described in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this 
section, not all members of the consolidated group may be included. 
Thus, a consolidated group may have recognized built-in gains that 
increase the amount of consolidated taxable income that may be offset by 
its pre-change net operating loss carryovers that did not arise (and are 
not treated as arising) in a SRLY, and also may have recognized built-in 
losses the absorption of which is limited. Similar results may obtain 
for loss subgroups under paragraphs (g)(2)(iii) and (iv) of this 
section. See Sec. 1.1502-93(c)(2) for rules prohibiting the use of 
recognized built-in gains to increase the amount of consolidated taxable 
income that can be offset by recognized built-in losses.
    (3) Coordination with rule that ends separate tracking. See Sec. 
1.1502-96(a) for special rules relating to members (or loss subgroups) 
that have an ownership change within six months before, on, or after 
becoming a member of the group.
    (4) Acquisitions of built-in gain or loss assets. A member of a 
consolidated group (or loss subgroup) may not, in determining its 
separately computed net unrealized built-in gain or loss, include any 
gain or loss with respect to assets acquired with a principal purpose to 
affect the amount of its net unrealized built-in gain or loss. A group 
(or loss subgroup) may not, in determining its net unrealized built-in 
gain or loss, include any gain or loss of a member acquired with a 
principal purpose to affect the amount of its net unrealized built-in 
gain or loss.
    (5) Indirect ownership. A member's separately computed net 
unrealized built-in gain or loss is adjusted to the extent necessary to 
prevent any duplication of unrealized gain or loss attributable to the 
member's indirect ownership interest in another member through a 
nonmember if the member has a 5-percent or greater ownership interest in 
the nonmember.
    (6) Common parent not common parent for five years. If the common 
parent has become the common parent of an existing group within the 
previous 5 year period in a transaction described in Sec. 1.1502-
75(d)(2)(ii) or (3), appropriate adjustments must be made in applying 
paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(A) of this section so that corporations that have 
not been members of the group for five years are not included. In such a 
case, references to the common parent in paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(A) of this 
section are to the former common parent. Thus, members of the group 
remaining in existence (including the new common parent) that have not 
been affiliated with the former common parent (or that have not been 
members of that group) for the five consecutive year period ending on 
the day that the determination is made are not included under paragraph 
(g)(2)(ii)(A) of this section. See, however, Sec. 1.1502-96(a)(2) for 
special rules relating to members (or loss subgroups) that have an 
ownership change within six months before, on, or after the time that 
the member becomes a member of the group.
    (h) Recognized built-in gain or loss--(1) In general. [Reserved]
    (2) Disposition of stock or an intercompany obligation of a member. 
Gain or loss recognized by a member on the disposition of stock 
(including stock described in section 1504(a)(4) and Sec. 1.382-
2T(f)(18)(ii) and (iii)) of another member is treated as a recognized 
gain or loss for purposes of section 382(h)(2) (unless disallowed under 
Sec. 1.337(d)-2T, Sec. 1.1502-35T, or otherwise), even though gain or 
loss on such stock was not included in the determination of a net 
unrealized built-in gain or loss under paragraph (g)(1) of this section. 
Gain or loss recognized by a member with respect to an intercompany 
obligation is treated as recognized gain or loss only to the extent (if 
any) the transaction gives rise to aggregate income or loss within the 
consolidated group.
    (3) Intercompany transactions. Gain or loss that is deferred under 
provisions such as section 267 and Sec. 1.1502-13 is treated as 
recognized built-in gain or

[[Page 494]]

loss only to the extent taken into account by the group during the 
recognition period. See also Sec. 1.1502-13(c)(7) Example 10.
    (4) Exchanged basis property. If the adjusted basis of any asset is 
determined, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by reference to 
the adjusted basis of another asset held by the member at the beginning 
of the recognition period, the asset is treated, with appropriate 
adjustments, as held by the member at the beginning of the recognition 
period.
    (i) [Reserved]
    (j) Predecessor and successor corporations. A reference in this 
section and Sec. Sec. 1.1502-92 through 1.1502-99 to a corporation, 
member, common parent, loss subgroup parent, or subsidiary includes, as 
the context may require, a reference to a predecessor or successor 
corporation as defined in Sec. 1.1502-1(f)(4). For example, the 
determination whether a successor satisfies the continuous affiliation 
requirement of paragraph (d)(2)(i) or (g)(2)(ii) of this section is made 
by reference to its predecessor.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1502-92  Ownership change of a loss group or a loss subgroup.

    (a) Scope. This section provides rules for determining if there is 
an ownership change for purposes of section 382 with respect to a loss 
group or a loss subgroup. See Sec. 1.1502-94 for special rules for 
determining if there is an ownership change with respect to a new loss 
member and Sec. 1.1502-96(b) for special rules for determining if there 
is an ownership change of a subsidiary.
    (b) Determination of an ownership change--(1) Parent change method--
(i) Loss group. A loss group has an ownership change if the loss group's 
common parent has an ownership change under section 382 and the 
regulations thereunder. Solely for purposes of determining whether the 
common parent has an ownership change--
    (A) The losses described in Sec. 1.1502-91(c) are treated as net 
operating losses (or a net unrealized built-in loss) of the common 
parent; and
    (B) The common parent determines the earliest day that its testing 
period can begin by reference to only the attributes that make the group 
a loss group under Sec. 1.1502-91(c).
    (ii) Loss subgroup. A loss subgroup has an ownership change if the 
loss subgroup parent has an ownership change under section 382 and the 
regulations thereunder. The principles of Sec. 1.1502-95(b) (relating 
to ceasing to be a member of a consolidated group) apply in determining 
whether the loss subgroup parent has an ownership change. Solely for 
purposes of determining whether the loss subgroup parent has an 
ownership change--
    (A) The losses described in Sec. 1.1502-91(d) are treated as net 
operating losses (or a net unrealized built-in loss) of the loss 
subgroup parent;
    (B) The day that the members of the loss subgroup become members of 
the group (or a loss subgroup) is treated as a testing date within the 
meaning of Sec. 1.382-2(a)(4); and
    (C) The loss subgroup parent determines the earliest day that its 
testing period can begin under Sec. 1.382-2T(d)(3) by reference to only 
the attributes that make the members a loss subgroup under Sec. 1.1502-
91(d).
    (iii) Special rule if election regarding section 1504(a)(1) 
relationship is made--(A) Ownership change of deemed loss subgroup 
parent is an ownership change of loss subgroup. If the common parent 
makes an election under Sec. 1.1502-91(d)(4), each of the members in 
the loss subgroup is treated as the loss subgroup parent for purposes of 
determining whether the loss subgroup has an ownership change under 
section 382 and the regulations thereunder on or after the day the 
members become members of the group.
    (B) Exception. Paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(A) of this section does not 
apply to cause an ownership change of a loss subgroup if a deemed loss 
subgroup parent has an ownership change upon (or after) ceasing to be a 
member of the current group.
    (2) Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of 
this paragraph (b):

    Example 1. Loss group--ownership change of the common parent. (i) A 
owns all the L stock. L owns 80 percent and B owns 20 percent of the L1 
stock. For Year 1, the L group has a consolidated net operating loss 
that resulted from the operations of L1 and that is carried

[[Page 495]]

over to Year 2. The value of the L stock is $1000. The total value of 
the L1 stock is $600 and the value of the L1 stock held by B is $120. 
The L group is a loss group under Sec. 1.1502-91(c)(1) because it is 
entitled to use its net operating loss carryover from Year 1. On August 
15, Year 2, A sells 51 percent of the L stock to C. The following is a 
graphic illustration of these facts:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR02JY99.003

    (ii) Under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, section 382 and the 
regulations thereunder are applied to L to determine whether it (and 
therefore the L loss group) has an ownership change with respect to its 
net operating loss carryover from Year 1 attributable to L1 on August 
15, Year 2. The sale of the L stock to C causes an ownership change of L 
under Sec. 1.382-2T and of the L loss group under paragraph (b)(1)(i) 
of this section. The amount of consolidated taxable income of the L loss 
group for any post-change taxable year that may be offset by its pre-
change consolidated attributes (that is, the net operating loss 
carryover from Year 1 attributable to L1) may not exceed the 
consolidated section 382 limitation for the L loss group for the taxable 
year.

[[Page 496]]

    Example 2. Loss group--owner shifts of subsidiaries disregarded. (i) 
The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that on August 15, Year 
2, A sells only 49 percent of the L stock to C and, on December 12, Year 
3, in an unrelated transaction, B sells the 20 percent of the L1 stock 
to D. A's sale of the L stock to C does not cause an ownership change of 
L under Sec. 1.382-2T nor of the L loss group under paragraph (b)(1)(i) 
of this section. The following is a graphic illustration of these facts:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR02JY99.004

    (ii) B's subsequent sale of L1 stock is not taken into account for 
purposes of determining whether the L loss group has an ownership change 
under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, and, accordingly, there is no 
ownership change of the L loss group. See paragraph (c) of this section, 
however, for a supplemental ownership change method that would apply to 
cause an ownership change if the purchases by C and D were pursuant to a 
plan or arrangement and certain other conditions are satisfied.
    Example 3. Loss subgroup--ownership change of loss subgroup parent 
controls. (i) P owns all the L stock. L owns 80 percent and A owns 20 
percent of the L1 stock. The P group has a consolidated net operating 
loss arising in Year 1 that is carried over to Year 2. On September 9, 
Year 2, P sells 51 percent of the L stock to B, and L1 is apportioned a 
portion of the Year 1 consolidated net operating loss under Sec. 
1.1502-21(b), which it carries over to its next taxable year. L and L1 
file a consolidated return for their first taxable year ending after the 
sale to B. The following is a graphic illustration of these facts:

[[Page 497]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR02JY99.005

    (ii) Under Sec. 1.1502-91(d)(1), L and L1 compose a loss subgroup 
on September 9, Year 2, the day that they become members of the L group. 
Under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, section 382 and the 
regulations thereunder are applied to L to determine whether it (and 
therefore the L loss subgroup) has an ownership change with respect to 
the portion

[[Page 498]]

of the Year 1 consolidated net operating loss that is apportioned to L1 
on September 9, Year 2. L has an ownership change resulting from P's 
sale of 51 percent of the L stock to A. Therefore, the L loss subgroup 
has an ownership change with respect to that loss.
    Example 4. Loss group and loss subgroup--contemporaneous ownership 
changes. (i) A owns all the stock of corporation M, M owns 35 percent 
and B owns 65 percent of the L stock, and L owns all the L1 stock. The L 
group has a consolidated net operating loss arising in Year 1 that is 
carried over to Year 2. On May 19, Year 2, B sells 45 percent of the L 
stock to M for cash. M, L, and L1 thereafter file consolidated returns. 
L and L1 are each apportioned a portion of the Year 1 consolidated net 
operating loss, which they carry over to the M group's Year 2 and Year 3 
consolidated return years. The M group has a consolidated net operating 
loss arising in Year 2 that is carried over to Year 3. On June 9, Year 
3, A sells 70 percent of the M stock to C. The following is a graphic 
illustration of these facts:

[[Page 499]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR02JY99.006

    (ii) Under Sec. 1.1502-91(d)(1), L and L1 compose a loss subgroup 
on May 19, Year 2, the day they become members of the M group. Under 
paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, section 382 and the regulations 
thereunder are applied to L to determine whether L (and therefore the L 
loss subgroup) has an ownership change with respect to the loss

[[Page 500]]

carryovers from Year 1 on May 19, Year 2, a testing date because of B's 
sale of L stock to M. The sale of L stock to M results in only a 45 
percentage point increase in A's ownership of L stock. Thus, there is no 
ownership change of L (or the L loss subgroup) with respect to those 
loss carryovers under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section on that day.
    (iii) June 9, Year 3, is also a testing date with respect to the L 
loss subgroup because of A's sale of M stock to C. The sale results in a 
56 percentage point increase in C's ownership of L stock, and L has an 
ownership change. Therefore, the L loss subgroup has an ownership change 
on that day with respect to the loss carryovers from Year 1.
    (iv) Paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section requires that section 382 
and the regulations thereunder be applied to M to determine whether M 
(and therefore the M loss group) has an ownership change with respect to 
the net operating loss carryover from Year 2 on June 9, Year 3, a 
testing date because of A's sale of M stock to C. The sale results in a 
70 percentage point increase in C's ownership of M stock, and M has an 
ownership change. Therefore, the M loss group has an ownership change on 
that day with respect to that loss carryover.
    Example 5--Deemed subgroup parent. (i) P owns all the stock of L and 
L1 and 80 percent of the stock of T. A owns the remaining 20 percent of 
the stock of T. L1 owns all the stock of L2. P1, which owns 60 percent 
of the stock of P, acquires, at the beginning of Year 2, the T, L, and 
L1 stock owned by P, and T, L, L1, and L2 become members of the P1 
group. The P group has a consolidated net operating loss arising in Year 
1 that is carried over to Year 2. L, L1, and L2 are each apportioned a 
portion of the Year 1 consolidated net operating loss under Sec. 
1.1502-21(b), which they carry over to the P1 group's Year 2 and Year 3 
consolidated return years. P1 makes the election described in Sec. 
1.1502-91(d)(4) to treat T, L, L1 and L2 as meeting the section 
1504(a)(1) requirement of Sec. 1.1502-91(d)(1)(ii). As a result of the 
election, T, L, L1 and L2 compose a loss subgroup and T, L, L1, and L2 
are each treated as the loss subgroup parent for purposes of this 
paragraph (b). Because of P1's indirect ownership of T, L, L1, and L2 
prior to P1's acquisition of the T, L, and L1 stock, P1's acquisition 
does not cause an ownership change of the loss subgroup.
    (ii) On February 2, Year 3, L1 sells all of the stock of L2 to B. 
Although L2 is treated as a loss subgroup parent, the determination 
whether the loss subgroup comprised of T, L, and L1 has an ownership 
change under this paragraph (b) is made without regard to the sale of L2 
because L2's ownership change occurred upon ceasing to be a member of 
the P1 group. See Sec. 1.1502-95(b) to determine the application of 
section 382 to L2 when L2 ceases to be a member of the P1 group and the 
T, L, L1 and L2 loss subgroup.
    (iii) On March 26, Year 3, A sells her 20 percent minority stock 
interest in T to C . C's purchase, together with the 32 percentage point 
owner shift effected by P1's acquisition of the T stock at the beginning 
of Year 2, causes an ownership change of T, and therefore of the loss 
subgroup comprised of T, L, and L1.

    (3) Special adjustments--(i) Common parent succeeded by a new common 
parent. For purposes of determining if a loss group has an ownership 
change, if the common parent of a loss group is succeeded or acquired by 
a new common parent and the loss group remains in existence, the new 
common parent is treated as a continuation of the former common parent 
with appropriate adjustments to take into account shifts in ownership of 
the former common parent during the testing period (including shifts 
that occur incident to the common parent's becoming the former common 
parent). A new common parent may be a continuation of the former common 
parent even if, under Sec. 1.1502-91(g)(2)(ii), the new common parent 
is not included in determining whether the group has a net unrealized 
built-in loss.
    (ii) Newly created loss subgroup parent. For purposes of determining 
if a loss subgroup has an ownership change, if the member that is the 
loss subgroup parent has not been the loss subgroup parent for at least 
3 years as of a testing date, appropriate adjustments must be made to 
take into account owner shifts of members of the loss subgroup so that 
the structure of the loss subgroup does not have the effect of avoiding 
an ownership change under section 382. (See paragraph (b)(3)(iii), 
Example 3 of this section.)
    (iii) Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of 
this paragraph (b)(3):

    Example 1. New common parent acquires old common parent. (i) A, who 
owns all the L stock, sells 30 percent of the L stock to B on August 26, 
Year 1. L owns all the L1 stock. The L group has a consolidated net 
operating loss arising in Year 1 that is carried over to Year 3. On July 
16, Year 2, A and B transfer their L stock to a newly created holding 
company, HC, in exchange for 70 percent and 30 percent, respectively, of 
the HC stock. HC, L, and L1 thereafter file consolidated returns. Under 
the principles of Sec. 1.1502-75(d),

[[Page 501]]

the L loss group is treated as remaining in existence, with HC taking 
the place of L as the new common parent of the loss group. The following 
is a graphic illustration of these facts:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR02JY99.007


[[Page 502]]


    (ii) On November 11, Year 3, A sells 25 percent of the HC stock to 
B. For purposes of determining if the L loss group has an ownership 
change under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section on November 11, Year 3, 
HC is treated as a continuation of L under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this 
section because it acquired L and became the common parent without 
terminating the L loss group. Accordingly, HC's testing period commences 
on January 1, Year 1, the first day of the taxable year of the L loss 
group in which the consolidated net operating loss that is carried over 
to Year 3 arose (see Sec. 1.382-2T(d)(3)(i)). Immediately after the 
close of November 11, Year 3, B's percentage ownership interest in the 
common parent of the loss group (HC) has increased by 55 percentage 
points over its lowest percentage ownership during the testing period 
(zero percent). Accordingly, HC and the L loss group have an ownership 
change on that day.
    Example 2. New common parent in case in which common parent ceases 
to exist. (i) A, B, and C each own one-third of the L stock. L owns all 
the L1 stock. The L group has a consolidated net operating loss arising 
in Year 2 that is carried over to Year 3. On November 22, Year 3, L is 
merged into P, a corporation owned by D, and L1 thereafter files 
consolidated returns with P. A, B, and C, as a result of owning stock of 
L, own 90 percent of P's stock after the merger. D owns the remaining 10 
percent of P's stock. The merger of L into P qualifies as a reverse 
acquisition of the L group under Sec. 1.1502-75(d)(3)(i), and the L 
loss group is treated as remaining in existence, with P taking the place 
of L as the new common parent of the L group. The following is a graphic 
illustration of these facts:

[[Page 503]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR02JY99.008

    (ii) For purposes of determining if the L loss group has an 
ownership change on November 22, Year 3, the day of the merger, P is 
treated as a continuation of L so that the testing period for P begins 
on January 1, Year 2, the first day of the taxable year of the L loss 
group in which the consolidated net operating loss that is carried over 
to

[[Page 504]]

Year 3 arose. Immediately after the close of November 22, Year 3, D is 
the only 5-percent shareholder that has increased his ownership interest 
in P during the testing period (from zero to 10 percentage points).
    (iii) The facts are the same as in paragraph (i) of this Example 2, 
except that A has held 23\1/3\ shares (23\1/3\ percent) of L's stock for 
five years, and A purchased an additional 10 shares of L stock from E 
two years before the merger. Immediately after the close of the day of 
the merger (a testing date), A's ownership interest in P, the common 
parent of the L loss group, has increased by 6\2/3\ percentage points 
over A's lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (23\1/3\ 
percent to 30 percent).
    (iv) The facts are the same as in (i) of this Example 2, except that 
P has a net operating loss arising in Year 1 that is carried to the 
first consolidated return year ending after the day of the merger. 
Solely for purposes of determining whether the L loss group has an 
ownership change under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, the testing 
period for P commences on January 1, Year 2. P does not determine the 
earliest day for its testing period by reference to its net operating 
loss carryover from Year 1, which Sec. Sec. 1.1502-1(f)(3) and 1.1502-
75(d)(3)(i) treat as arising in a SRLY. See Sec. 1.1502-94 to determine 
the application of section 382 with respect to P's net operating loss 
carryover.
    Example 3. Newly acquired loss subgroup parent. (i) P owns all the L 
stock and L owns all the L1 stock. The P group has a consolidated net 
operating loss arising in Year 1 that is carried over to Year 3. On 
January 19, Year 2, L issues a 20 percent stock interest to B. On 
February 5, Year 3, P contributes its L stock to a newly formed 
subsidiary, HC, in exchange for all the HC stock, and distributes the HC 
stock to its sole shareholder A. HC, L, and L1 thereafter file 
consolidated returns. A portion of the P group's Year 1 consolidated net 
operating loss is apportioned to L and L1 under Sec. 1.1502-21(b) and 
is carried over to the HC group's year ending after February 5, Year 3. 
HC, L, and L1 compose a loss subgroup within the meaning of Sec. 
1.1502-91(d) with respect to the net operating loss carryovers from Year 
1. The following is a graphic illustration of these facts:

[[Page 505]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR02JY99.009

    (ii) February 5, Year 3, is a testing date for HC as the loss 
subgroup parent with respect to the net operating loss carryovers of L 
and L1 from Year 1. See paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B) of this section. For 
purposes of determining whether HC has an ownership change on the 
testing date, appropriate adjustments must be made with respect to the 
changes in the

[[Page 506]]

percentage ownership of the stock of HC because HC was not the loss 
subgroup parent for at least 3 years prior to the day on which it became 
a member of the HC loss subgroup (a testing date). The appropriate 
adjustments include adjustments so that HC succeeds to the owner shifts 
of other members of the former group. Thus, HC succeeds to the owner 
shift of L that resulted from the sale of the 20 percent interest to B 
in determining whether the HC loss subgroup has an ownership change on 
February 5, Year 3, and on any subsequent testing date that includes 
January 19, Year 2.

    (4) End of separate tracking of certain losses. If Sec. 1.1502-
96(a) (relating to the end of separate tracking of attributes) applies 
to a loss subgroup, then, while one or more members that were included 
in the loss subgroup remain members of the consolidated group, there is 
an ownership change with respect to their attributes described in Sec. 
1.1502-96(a)(2) only if the consolidated group is a loss group and has 
an ownership change under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section (or such a 
member has an ownership change under Sec. 1.1502-96(b) (relating to 
ownership changes of subsidiaries)). If, however, the loss subgroup has 
had an ownership change before Sec. 1.1502-96(a) applies, see Sec. 
1.1502-96(c) for the continuing application of the subgroup's section 
382 limitation with respect to its pre-change subgroup attributes.
    (c) Supplemental rules for determining ownership change--
    (1) Scope. This paragraph (c) contains a supplemental rule for 
determining whether there is an ownership change of a loss group (or 
loss subgroup). It applies in addition to, and not instead of, the rules 
of paragraph (b) of this section. Thus, for example, if the common 
parent of the loss group has an ownership change under paragraph (b) of 
this section, the loss group has an ownership change even if, by 
applying this paragraph (c), the common parent would not have an 
ownership change. This paragraph (c) does not apply in determining an 
ownership change of a loss subgroup for which an election under Sec. 
1.1502-91(d)(4) is made.
    (2) Cause for applying supplemental rule. This paragraph (c) applies 
to a loss group (or loss subgroup) if--
    (i) Any 5-percent shareholder of the common parent (or loss subgroup 
parent) increases its percentage ownership interest in the stock of 
both--
    (A) A subsidiary of the loss group (or loss subgroup) other than by 
a direct or indirect acquisition of stock of the common parent (or loss 
subgroup parent); and
    (B) The common parent (or loss subgroup parent);
    (ii) Those increases occur within a 3 year period ending on any day 
of a consolidated return year or, if shorter, the period beginning on 
the first day following the most recent ownership change of the loss 
group (or loss subgroup); and
    (iii) Either--
    (A) The common parent (or loss subgroup parent) has actual knowledge 
of the increase in the 5-percent shareholder's ownership interest in the 
stock of the subsidiary (or has actual knowledge of the plan or 
arrangement described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section) before the 
date that the group's income tax return is filed for the taxable year 
that includes the date of that increase; or
    (B) At any time during the period described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) 
of this section, the 5-percent shareholder of the common parent is also 
a 5-percent shareholder of the subsidiary (determined without regard to 
paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section) whose percentage increase in the 
ownership of the stock of the subsidiary would be taken into account in 
determining if the subsidiary has an ownership change (determined as if 
the subsidiary was a loss corporation and applying the principles of 
Sec. 1.382-2T(k), including the principles relating to duty to 
inquire).
    (3) Operating rules. Solely for purposes of this paragraph (c)--
    (i) A 5-percent shareholder of the common parent (or loss subgroup 
parent) is treated as increasing its ownership interest in the stock of 
a subsidiary to the extent, if any, that another person or persons 
increases its percentage ownership interest in the stock of a subsidiary 
pursuant to a plan or arrangement under which the 5-percent shareholder 
increases its percentage ownership interest in the common parent (or 
loss subgroup parent);
    (ii) The rules in section 382(l)(3) and Sec. Sec. 1.382-2T(h) and 
1.382-4(d) (relating to

[[Page 507]]

constructive ownership) apply with respect to the stock of the 
subsidiary by treating such stock as stock of a loss corporation; and
    (iii) In the case of a loss subgroup, a subsidiary includes any 
member of the loss subgroup other than the loss subgroup parent. (A loss 
subgroup parent is, however, a subsidiary of the loss group of which it 
is a member.)
    (4) Supplemental ownership change rules. The determination whether 
the common parent (or loss subgroup parent) has an ownership change is 
made by applying paragraph (b)(1) of this section as modified by the 
following additional rules:
    (i) Additional testing dates for the common parent (or loss subgroup 
parent). A testing date for the common parent (or loss subgroup parent) 
also includes--
    (A) Each day on which there is an increase in the percentage 
ownership of stock of a subsidiary as described in paragraph (c)(2) of 
this section; and
    (B) The first day of the first consolidated return year for which 
the group is a loss group (or the members compose a loss subgroup).
    (ii) Treatment of subsidiary stock as stock of the common parent (or 
loss subgroup parent). The common parent (or loss subgroup parent) is 
treated as though it had issued to the person acquiring (or deemed to 
acquire) the subsidiary stock an amount of its own stock (by value) that 
equals the value of the subsidiary stock represented by the percentage 
increase in that person's ownership of the subsidiary (determined on a 
separate entity basis). Similar principles apply if the increase in 
percentage ownership interest is effected by a redemption or similar 
transaction.
    (iii) Different testing periods. Stock treated as issued under 
paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section on a testing date is not treated as 
so issued for purposes of applying the ownership change rules of this 
paragraph (c) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section in a testing period 
that does not include that testing date.
    (iv) Disaffiliation of a subsidiary. If a deemed issuance of stock 
under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section would not cause the loss 
group (or loss subgroup) to have an ownership change before the day (if 
any) on which the subsidiary ceases to be a member of the loss group (or 
subgroup), then paragraph (c)(4) of this section shall not apply.
    (v) Subsidiary stock acquired first. If an increase of subsidiary 
stock described in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section occurs before 
the date that the 5-percent shareholder increases its percentage 
ownership interest in the stock of the common parent (or loss subgroup 
parent), then the deemed issuance of stock is treated as occurring on 
that later date, but in an amount equal to the value of the subsidiary 
stock on the date it was acquired.
    (vi) Anti-duplication rule. If two or more 5-percent shareholders 
are treated as increasing their percentage ownership interests pursuant 
to the same plan or arrangement described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this 
section, appropriate adjustments must be made so that the amount of 
stock treated as issued is not taken into account more than once.
    (5) Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of 
this paragraph (c):

    Example 1. Stock of the common parent under supplemental rules. (i) 
A owns all the L stock. L is not a member of an affiliated group and has 
a net operating loss carryover arising in Year 1 that is carried over to 
Year 6. On September 20, Year 6, L transfers all of its assets and 
liabilities to a newly created subsidiary, S, in exchange for S stock. L 
and S thereafter file consolidated returns. On November 23, Year 6, B 
contributes cash to L in exchange for a 45 percent ownership interest in 
L and contributes cash to S for a 20 percent ownership interest in S.
    (ii) During the 3 year period ending on November 23, Year 6, B is a 
5% shareholder of L and of S that increases its ownership interest in L 
and S during that period. Under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, 
the determination whether L (the common parent of a loss group) has an 
ownership change on November 23, Year 6 (or, subject to paragraph 
(c)(4)(iv) of this section, on any testing date in the testing period 
which includes November 23, Year 6), is made by applying paragraph 
(b)(1)(i) of this section and by treating the value of B's 20 percent 
ownership interest in S as if it were L stock issued to B. Because B is 
a 5% shareholder of both L and S during the 3 year period ending on 
November 23, Year 6, and B's increase in its percentage ownership in the 
stock of S would be taken into account in determining if S (if it were a 
loss corporation) had an ownership change,

[[Page 508]]

it is not relevant whether L has actual knowledge of B's acquisition of 
S stock.
    Example 2. Plan or arrangement--public offering of subsidiary stock. 
(i) A owns all the stock of L and L owns all the stock of L1. The L 
group has a consolidated net operating loss arising in Year 1 that 
resulted from the operations of L1 and that is carried over to Year 2. 
On October 7, Year 2, A sells 49 percent of the L stock to B. As part of 
a plan that includes the sale of L stock, A causes a public offering of 
L1 stock on November 6, Year 2. L has actual knowledge of the plan. The 
following is a graphic illustration of these facts:

[[Page 509]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR02JY99.010

    (ii) A's sale of the L stock to B does not cause an ownership change 
of the L loss group on October 7, Year 2, under the rules of Sec. 
1.382-2T and paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.
    (iii) Because the issuance of L1 stock to the public occurs as part 
of the same plan as

[[Page 510]]

B's acquisition of L stock, and L has knowledge of the plan, paragraph 
(c)(4) of this section applies to determine whether the L loss group has 
an ownership change on November 6, Year 2 (or, subject to paragraph 
(c)(4)(iv) of this section, on any testing date for which the testing 
period includes November 6, Year 2).

    (d) Testing period following ownership change under this section. If 
a loss group (or a loss subgroup) has had an ownership change under this 
section, the testing period for determining a subsequent ownership 
change with respect to pre-change consolidated attributes (or pre-change 
subgroup attributes) begins no earlier than the first day following the 
loss group's (or loss subgroup's) most recent change date.
    (e) Information statements--(1) Common parent of a loss group. The 
common parent of a loss group must file the information statement 
required by Sec. 1.382-2T(a)(2)(ii) for a consolidated return year 
because of any owner shift, equity structure shift, or other transaction 
described in Sec. 1.382-2T(a)(2)(i)--
    (i) With respect to the common parent and with respect to any 
subsidiary stock subject to paragraph (c) of this section; and
    (ii) With respect to an ownership change described in Sec. 1.1502-
96(b) (relating to ownership changes of subsidiaries).
    (2) Abbreviated statement with respect to loss subgroups. The common 
parent of a consolidated group that has a loss subgroup during a 
consolidated return year must file the information statement required by 
Sec. 1.382-2T(a)(2)(ii) because of any owner shift, equity structure 
shift, or other transaction described in Sec. 1.382-2T(a)(2)(i) with 
respect to the loss subgroup parent and with respect to any subsidiary 
stock subject to paragraph (c) of this section. Instead of filing a 
separate statement for each loss subgroup parent, the common parent 
(which is treated as a loss corporation) may file the single statement 
described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section. In addition to the 
information concerning stock ownership of the common parent, the single 
statement must identify each loss subgroup parent and state which loss 
subgroups, if any, have had ownership changes during the consolidated 
return year. The loss subgroup parent is, however, still required to 
maintain the records necessary to determine if the loss subgroup has an 
ownership change. This paragraph (e)(2) applies with respect to the 
attributes of a loss subgroup until, under Sec. 1.1502-96(a), the 
attributes are no longer treated as described in Sec. 1.1502-91(d) 
(relating to the definition of loss subgroup). After that time, the 
information statement described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section must 
be filed with respect to those attributes.

Sec. 1.1502-93  Consolidated section 382 limitation (or subgroup section 382 limitation).

    (a) Determination of the consolidated section 382 limitation (or 
subgroup section 382 limitation)--(1) In general. Following an ownership 
change, the consolidated section 382 limitation (or subgroup section 382 
limitation) for any post-change year is an amount equal to the value of 
the loss group (or loss subgroup), as defined in paragraph (b) of this 
section, multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate that applies with 
respect to the ownership change, and adjusted as required by section 382 
and the regulations thereunder. See, for example, section 382(b)(2) 
(relating to the carryforward of unused section 382 limitation), section 
382(b)(3)(B) (relating to the section 382 limitation for the post-change 
year that includes the change date), section 382(h) (relating to 
recognized built-in gains and section 338 gains), and section 382(m)(2) 
(relating to short taxable years). For special rules relating to the 
recognized built-in gains of a loss group (or loss subgroup), see 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
    (2) Coordination with apportionment rule. For special rules relating 
to apportionment of a consolidated section 382 limitation (or a subgroup 
section 382 limitation) or net unrealized built-in gain when one or more 
corporations cease to be members of a loss group (or a loss subgroup) 
and to aggregation of amounts so apportioned, see Sec. 1.1502-95(c).
    (b) Value of the loss group (or loss subgroup)--(1) Stock value 
immediately before ownership change. Subject to any adjustment under 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the value of the loss group

[[Page 511]]

(or loss subgroup) is the value, immediately before the ownership 
change, of the stock of each member, other than stock that is owned 
directly or indirectly by another member. For this purpose--
    (i) Ownership is determined under Sec. 1.382-2T;
    (ii) A member is considered to indirectly own stock of another 
member through a nonmember only if the member has a 5-percent or greater 
ownership interest in the nonmember; and
    (iii) Stock includes stock described in section 1504(a)(4) and Sec. 
1.382-2T(f)(18)(ii) and (iii).
    (2) Adjustment to value--(i) In general. The value of the loss group 
(or loss subgroup), as determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section, is adjusted under any rule in section 382 or the regulations 
thereunder requiring an adjustment to such value for purposes of 
computing the amount of the section 382 limitation. See, for example, 
section 382(e)(2) (redemptions and corporate contractions), section 
382(l)(1) (certain capital contributions) and section 382(l)(4) 
(ownership of substantial nonbusiness assets). For purposes of section 
382(e)(2), redemptions and corporate contractions that do not effect a 
transfer of value outside of the loss group (or loss subgroup) are 
disregarded. For purposes of section 382(l)(1), capital contributions 
between members of the loss group (or loss subgroup) (or a contribution 
of stock to a member made solely to satisfy the loss subgroup parent 
requirement of paragraph (d)(1)(ii) or (2)(ii) of this section), are not 
taken into account. Also, the substantial nonbusiness asset test of 
section 382(l)(4) is applied on a group (or subgroup) basis, and is not 
applied separately to its members.
    (ii) Anti-duplication. Appropriate adjustments must be made to the 
extent necessary to prevent any duplication of the value of the stock of 
a member, even though corporations that do not file consolidated returns 
may not be required to make such an adjustment. In making these 
adjustments, the group (or loss subgroup) may apply the principles of 
Sec. 1.382-8 (relating to controlled groups of corporations) in 
determining the value of a loss group (or loss subgroup) even if that 
section would not apply if separate returns were filed. Also, the 
principles of Sec. 1.382-5(d) (relating to successive ownership changes 
and absorption of a section 382 limitation) may apply to adjust the 
consolidated section 382 limitation (or subgroup section 382 limitation) 
of a loss group (or loss subgroup) to avoid a duplication of value if 
there are simultaneous (rather than successive) ownership changes.
    (3) Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of 
this paragraph (b):

    Example 1. Basic case. (i) L, L1, and L2 compose a loss group. L has 
outstanding common stock, the value of which is $100. L1 has outstanding 
common stock and preferred stock that is described in section 
1504(a)(4). L owns 90 percent of the L1 common stock, and A owns the 
remaining 10 percent of the L1 common stock plus all the preferred 
stock. The value of the L1 common stock is $40, and the value of the L1 
preferred stock is $30. L2 has outstanding common stock, 50 percent of 
which is owned by L and 50 percent by L1. The L group has an ownership 
change. The following is a graphic illustration of these facts:

[[Page 512]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR02JY99.011

    (ii) Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the L group does not 
include the value of the stock of any member that is owned directly or 
indirectly by another member in computing its consolidated section 382 
limitation. Accordingly, the value of the stock of the loss group is 
$134, the sum of the value of--
    (a) The common stock of L ($100);
    (b) The 10 percent of the L1 common stock ($4) owned by A; and
    (c) The L1 preferred stock ($30) owned by A.
    Example 2--Indirect ownership. (i) L and L1 compose a consolidated 
group. L's stock has a value of $100. L owns 80 shares (worth $80) and 
corporation M owns 20 shares (worth $20) of the L1 stock. L also owns 79 
percent of the stock of corporation M. The L group has an ownership 
change. The following is a graphic illustration of these facts:

[[Page 513]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR02JY99.012

    (ii) Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, because of L's more 
than 5 percent ownership interest in M, a nonmember, L is considered to 
indirectly own 15.8 shares of the L1 stock held by M (79% x 20 shares). 
The value of the L loss group is $104.20, the sum of the values of--
    (a) The L stock ($100); and
    (b) The L1 stock not owned directly or indirectly by L (21% x $20, 
or $4.20).

    (c) Recognized built-in gain of a loss group or loss subgroup--(1) 
In general. If a loss group (or loss subgroup) has a net unrealized 
built-in gain, any recognized built-in gain of the loss group (or loss 
subgroup) is taken into account under section 382(h) in determining the 
consolidated section 382 limitation (or subgroup section 382 
limitation).
    (2) Adjustments. Appropriate adjustments must be made so that any 
recognized built-in gain of a member that increases more than one 
section 382 limitation (whether consolidated, subgroup, or separate) 
does not effect a duplication in the amount of consolidated taxable 
income that can be offset by pre-change net operating losses. For 
example, a consolidated section 382 limitation that is increased by 
recognized built-in gains is reduced to the extent that pre-change net 
operating losses of a loss subgroup absorb additional consolidated 
taxable income because the same recognized built-in gains caused an 
increase in that loss subgroup's section 382 limitation. In addition, 
recognized built-in gain may not increase the amount of consolidated 
taxable income that can be offset by recognized built-in losses.
    (d) Continuity of business--(1) In general. A loss group (or a loss 
subgroup) is treated as a single entity for purposes of determining 
whether it satisfies the continuity of business enterprise requirement 
of section 382(c)(1).
    (2) Example. The following example illustrates the principle of this 
paragraph (d):

    Example. Continuity of business enterprise. L owns all the stock of 
two subsidiaries, L1 and L2. The L group has an ownership change. It has 
pre-change consolidated attributes attributable to L2. Each of the 
members has historically conducted a separate line of business. Each 
line of business is approximately equal in value. One year after the 
ownership change, L discontinues its separate business and the business 
of L2. The separate business of L1 is continued for the remainder of the 
2 year period following the ownership change. The continuity of business 
enterprise requirement of section 382(c)(1) is met even though the 
separate businesses of L and L2 are discontinued.

    (e) Limitations of losses under other rules. If a section 382 
limitation for a

[[Page 514]]

post-change year exceeds the consolidated taxable income that may be 
offset by pre-change attributes for any reason, including the 
application of the limitation of Sec. 1.1502-21(c), the amount of the 
excess is carried forward under section 382(b)(2) (relating to the 
carryforward of unused section 382 limitation).

<R05>
Sec. 1.1502-94  Coordination with section 382 and the regulations 
thereunder when a corporation becomes a member of a consolidated group.

    (a) Scope--(1) In general. This section applies section 382 and the 
regulations thereunder to a corporation that is a new loss member of a 
consolidated group. A corporation is a new loss member if it--
    (i) Carries over a net operating loss that arose (or is treated 
under Sec. 1.1502-21(c) as arising) in a SRLY with respect to the 
current group, and that is not described in Sec. 1.1502-91(d)(1); or
    (ii) Has a net unrealized built-in loss (determined under paragraph 
(c) of this section immediately before it becomes a member of the 
current group by treating that day as a change date) that is not taken 
into account under Sec. 1.1502-91(d)(2) in determining whether two or 
more corporations compose a loss subgroup.
    (2) Successor corporation as new loss member. A new loss member also 
includes any successor to a corporation that has a net operating loss 
carryover arising in a SRLY and that is treated as remaining in 
existence under Sec. 1.382-2(a)(1)(ii) following a transaction 
described in section 381(a).
    (3) Coordination in the case of a loss subgroup. For rules regarding 
the determination of whether there is an ownership change of a loss 
subgroup with respect to a net operating loss or a net unrealized built-
in loss described in Sec. 1.1502-91(d) (relating to the definition of 
loss subgroup) and the computation of a subgroup section 382 limitation 
following such an ownership change, see Sec. Sec. 1.1502-92 and 1.1502-
93.
    (4) End of separate tracking of certain losses. If Sec. 1.1502-
96(a) (relating to the end of separate tracking of attributes) applies 
to a new loss member, then, while that member remains a member of the 
consolidated group, there is an ownership change with respect to its 
attributes described in Sec. 1.1502-96(a)(2) only if the consolidated 
group is a loss group and has an ownership change under Sec. 1.1502-
92(b)(1)(i) (or that member has an ownership change under Sec. 1.1502-
96(b) (relating to ownership changes of subsidiaries)). If, however, the 
new loss member has had an ownership change before Sec. 1.1502-96(a) 
applies, see Sec. 1.1502-96(c) for the continuing application of the 
section 382 limitation with respect to the member's pre-change losses.
    (5) Cross-reference. See section 382(a) and Sec. 1.1502-96(c) for 
the continuing effect of an ownership change after a corporation becomes 
or ceases to be a member.
    (b) Application of section 382 to a new loss member--(1) In general. 
Section 382 and the regulations thereunder apply to a new loss member to 
determine, on a separate entity basis, whether and to what extent a 
section 382 limitation applies to limit the amount of consolidated 
taxable income that may be offset by the new loss member's pre-change 
separate attributes. For example, if an ownership change with respect to 
the new loss member occurs under section 382 and the regulations 
thereunder, the amount of consolidated taxable income for any post-
change year that may be offset by the new loss member's pre-change 
separate attributes shall not exceed the section 382 limitation as 
determined separately under section 382(b) with respect to that member 
for such year. If the post-change year includes the change date, section 
382(b)(3)(A) is applied so that the section 382 limitation of the new 
loss member does not apply to the portion of the taxable income for such 
year that is allocable to the period in such year on or before the 
change date. See generally Sec. 1.382-6 (relating to the allocation of 
income and loss).
    (2) Adjustment to value. Appropriate adjustments must be made to the 
extent necessary to prevent any duplication of the value of the stock of 
a member, even though corporations that do not file consolidated returns 
may not be required to make such an adjustment. For example, the 
principles of

[[Page 515]]

Sec. 1.1502-93(b)(2)(ii) (relating to adjustments to value) apply in 
determining the value of a new loss member.
    (3) Pre-change separate attribute defined. A pre-change separate 
attribute of a new loss member is--
    (i) Any net operating loss carryover of the new loss member 
described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section; and
    (ii) Any recognized built-in loss of the new loss member.
    (4) Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of 
this paragraph (b):

    Example 1. Basic case. (i) A and P each own 50 percent of the L 
stock. On December 19, Year 6, P purchases 30 percent of the L stock 
from A for cash. L has net operating losses arising in Year 1 and Year 2 
that it carries over to Year 6 and Year 7. The following is a graphic 
illustration of these facts:

[[Page 516]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR02JY99.013

    (ii) L is a new loss member because it has net operating loss 
carryovers that arose in a SRLY with respect to the P group and L is not 
a member of a loss subgroup under Sec. 1.1502-91(d). Under section 382 
and the regulations thereunder, L is a loss corporation on December 19, 
Year 6, that day is a testing

[[Page 517]]

date for L, and the testing period for L commences on December 20, Year 
3.
    (iii) P's purchase of L stock does not cause an ownership change of 
L on December 19, Year 6, with respect to the net operating loss 
carryovers from Year 1 and Year 2 under section 382 and Sec. 1.382-2T. 
The use of the loss carryovers, however, is subject to limitation under 
Sec. 1.1502-21(c).
    Example 2. Multiple new loss members. (i) The facts are the same as 
in Example 1, and, on December 31, Year 6, L purchases all the stock of 
L1 from B for cash. L1 has a net operating loss of $40 arising in Year 3 
that it carries over to Year 7. The following is a graphic illustration 
of these facts:

[[Page 518]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR02JY99.014

    (ii) L1 is a new loss member because it has a net operating loss 
carryover from Year 3 that arose in a SRLY with respect to the P group 
and L1 is not a member of a loss subgroup under Sec. 1.1502-91(d)(1).

[[Page 519]]

    (iii) L's purchase of all the stock of L1 causes an ownership change 
of L1 on December 31, Year 6, under section 382 and Sec. 1.382-2T. 
Accordingly, a section 382 limitation based on the value of the L1 stock 
immediately before the ownership change limits the amount of 
consolidated taxable income of the P group for any post-change year that 
may be offset by L1's loss from Year 3.
    (iv) L1's ownership change upon becoming a member of the P group is 
an ownership change described in Sec. 1.1502-96(a). Thus, starting on 
January 1, Year 7, the P group no longer separately tracks owner shifts 
of the stock of L1 with respect to L1's loss from Year 3, and the P 
group is a loss group because L1's Year 3 loss is treated as a loss 
described in Sec. 1.1502-91(c).
    Example 3. Ownership changes of new loss members. (i) The facts are 
the same as in Example 2, and, on July 30, Year 7, C purchases all the 
stock of P for cash.
    (ii) L is a new loss member on July 30, Year 7, because its Year 1 
and Year 2 losses arose in SRLYs with respect to the P group and it is 
not a member of a loss subgroup under Sec. 1.1502-91(d)(1). The testing 
period for L commences on August 1, Year 4. C's purchase of all the P 
stock causes an ownership change of L on July 30, Year 7, under section 
382 and Sec. 1.382-2T with respect to its Year 1 and Year 2 losses. 
Accordingly, a section 382 limitation based on the value of the L stock 
immediately before the ownership change limits the amount of 
consolidated taxable income of the P group for any post-change year that 
may be offset by L's Year 1 and Year 2 losses. See Sec. 1.1502-21(c) 
for rules relating to an additional limitation.
    (iii) The P group is a loss group on July 30, Year 7, because it is 
entitled to use L1's loss from Year 3, and such loss is no longer 
treated as a loss of a new loss member starting the day after L1's 
ownership change on December 31, Year 6. See Sec. Sec. 1.1502-96(a) and 
1.1502-91(c)(2). C's purchase of all the P stock causes an ownership 
change of P, and therefore the P loss group, on July 30, Year 7, with 
respect to L1's Year 3 loss. Accordingly, a consolidated section 382 
limitation based on the value of the P stock immediately before the 
ownership change limits the amount of consolidated taxable income of the 
P group for any post-change year that may be offset by L1's Year 3 loss.

    (c) Built-in gains and losses. As the context may require, the 
principles of Sec. Sec. 1.1502-91(g) and (h) and 1.1502-93(c) (relating 
to built-in gains and losses) apply to a new loss member on a separate 
entity basis. See Sec. 1.1502-91(g)(4). See Sec. 1.1502-13 (including 
Example 10 of Sec. 1.1502-13(c)(7)) for rules relating to the treatment 
of intercompany transactions.
    (d) Information statements. The common parent of a consolidated 
group that has a new loss member subject to paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section during a consolidated return year must file the information 
statement required by Sec. 1.382-2T(a)(2)(ii) because of any owner 
shift, equity structure shift, or other transaction described in Sec. 
1.382-2T(a)(2)(i). Instead of filing a separate statement for each new 
loss member, the common parent may file a single statement described in 
Sec. 1.382-2T(a)(2)(ii) with respect to the stock ownership of the 
common parent (which is treated as a loss corporation). In addition to 
the information concerning stock ownership of the common parent, the 
single statement must identify each new loss member and state which new 
loss members, if any, have had ownership changes during the consolidated 
return year. The new loss member is, however, required to maintain the 
records necessary to determine if it has an ownership change. This 
paragraph (d) applies with respect to the attributes of a new loss 
member until an event occurs which ends separate tracking under Sec. 
1.1502-96(a). After that time, the information statement described in 
Sec. 1.1502-92(e)(1) must be filed with respect to these attributes.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1502-95  Rules on ceasing to be a member of a consolidated group 
(or loss subgroup).

    (a) In general--(1) Consolidated group. This section provides rules 
for applying section 382 on or after the day that a member ceases to be 
a member of a consolidated group (or loss subgroup). The rules concern 
how to determine whether an ownership change occurs with respect to 
losses of the member, and how a consolidated section 382 limitation (or 
subgroup section 382 limitation) and a loss group's (or loss subgroup's) 
net unrealized built-in gain or loss is apportioned to the member. As 
the context requires, a reference in this section to a loss group, a 
member, or a corporation also includes a reference to a loss subgroup, 
and a reference to a consolidated section 382 limitation also includes a 
reference to a subgroup section 382 limitation.

[[Page 520]]

    (2) Election by common parent. Only the common parent (not the loss 
subgroup parent) may make the election under paragraph (c) of this 
section to apportion a consolidated section 382 limitation (or subgroup 
section 382 limitation) or a loss group's (or loss subgroup's) net 
unrealized built-in gain.
    (3) Coordination with Sec. Sec. 1.1502-91 through 1.1502-93. For 
rules regarding the determination of whether there is an ownership 
change of a loss subgroup and the computation of a subgroup section 382 
limitation following such an ownership change, see Sec. Sec. 1.1502-91 
through 1.1502-93.
    (b) Separate application of section 382 when a member leaves a 
consolidated group--(1) In general. Except as provided in Sec. Sec. 
1.1502-91 through 1.1502-93 (relating to rules applicable to loss groups 
and loss subgroups), section 382 and the regulations thereunder apply to 
a corporation on a separate entity basis after it ceases to be a member 
of a consolidated group (or loss subgroup). Solely for purposes of 
determining whether a corporation has an ownership change--
    (i) Any portion of a consolidated net operating loss that is 
apportioned to the corporation under Sec. 1.1502-21(b) is treated as a 
net operating loss of the corporation beginning on the first day of the 
taxable year in which the loss arose;
    (ii) The testing period may include the period during which (or 
before which) the corporation was a member of the group (or loss 
subgroup); and
    (iii) Except to the extent provided in Sec. 1.1502-96(d) (relating 
to reattributed losses), the day it ceases to be a member of a 
consolidated group is treated as a testing date of the corporation 
within the meaning of Sec. 1.382-2(a)(4).
    (2) Effect of a prior ownership change of the group. If a loss group 
has had an ownership change under Sec. 1.1502-92 before a corporation 
ceases to be a member of a consolidated group (the former member)--
    (i) Any pre-change consolidated attribute that is subject to a 
consolidated section 382 limitation continues to be treated as a pre-
change loss with respect to the former member after it is apportioned to 
the former member and, if any net unrealized built-in loss is allocated 
to the former member under paragraph (e) of this section, any recognized 
built-in loss of the former member is a pre-change loss of the member;
    (ii) The section 382 limitation with respect to such pre-change 
attribute is zero unless the common parent, under paragraph (c) of this 
section, apportions to the former member all or part of the consolidated 
section 382 limitation applicable to such attribute. The limitation 
applicable to a pre-change attribute other than a recognized built-in 
loss may be increased to the extent that the common parent has 
apportioned all or part of the loss group's net unrealized built-in gain 
to the former member, and the former member recognizes built-in gain 
during the recognition period;
    (iii) The testing period for determining a subsequent ownership 
change with respect to such pre-change attribute (or such net unrealized 
built-in loss, if any) begins no earlier than the first day following 
the loss group's most recent change date; and
    (iv) As generally provided under section 382, an ownership change of 
the former member that occurs on or after the day it ceases to be a 
member of a loss group may result in an additional, lesser limitation 
amount with respect to such losses.
    (3) Application in the case of a loss subgroup. If two or more 
former members are included in the same loss subgroup immediately after 
they cease to be members of a consolidated group, the principles of 
paragraphs (b), (c) and (e) of this section apply to the loss subgroup. 
Therefore, for example, an apportionment by the common parent under 
paragraph (c) of this section is made to the loss subgroup rather than 
separately to its members. If the common parent of the consolidated 
group apportions all or part of a limitation (or net unrealized built-in 
gain) separately to one or more former members that are included in a 
loss subgroup because the common parent of the acquiring group makes an 
election under Sec. 1.1502-91(d)(4) with respect to those members, the 
aggregate of those separate amounts is treated as the amount apportioned 
to the loss subgroup. Such separate apportionment may occur, for

[[Page 521]]

example, because the election under Sec. 1.1502-91(d)(4) has not been 
filed at the time that the election of apportionment is made under 
paragraph (f) of this section.
    (4) Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of 
this paragraph (b):

    Example 1. Treatment of departing member as a separate corporation 
throughout the testing period. (i) A owns all the L stock. L owns all 
the stock of L1 and L2. The L group has a consolidated net operating 
loss arising in Year 1 that is carried over to Year 3. On January 12, 
Year 2, A sells 30 percent of the L stock to B. On February 7, Year 3, L 
sells 40 percent of the L2 stock to C, and L2 ceases to be a member of 
the group. A portion of the Year 1 consolidated net operating loss is 
apportioned to L2 under Sec. 1.1502-21(b) and is carried to L2's first 
separate return year, which ends December 31, Year 3. The following is a 
graphic illustration of these facts:

[[Page 522]]

    (ii) Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, L2 is a loss 
corporation on February 7, Year 3. Under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this 
section, February 7, Year 3, is a testing date. Under paragraph 
(b)(1)(ii) of this section, the testing period for L2 with respect to 
this testing date commences on January 1, Year 1, the first day of the 
taxable year in which the

[[Page 523]]

portion of the consolidated net operating loss apportioned to L2 arose. 
Therefore, in determining whether L2 has an ownership change on February 
7, Year 3, B's purchase of 30 percent of the L stock and C's purchase of 
40 percent of the L2 stock are each owner shifts. L2 has an ownership 
change under section 382(g) and Sec. 1.382-2T because B and C have 
increased their ownership interests in L2 by 18 and 40 percentage 
points, respectively, during the testing period.
    Example 2. Effect of prior ownership change of loss group. (i) L 
owns all the L1 stock and L1 owns all the L2 stock. The L loss group had 
an ownership change under Sec. 1.1502-92 in Year 2 with respect to a 
consolidated net operating loss arising in Year 1 and carried over to 
Year 2 and Year 3. The consolidated section 382 limitation computed 
solely on the basis of the value of the stock of L is $100. On December 
31, Year 2, L1 sells 25 percent of the stock of L2 to B. L2 is 
apportioned a portion of the Year 1 consolidated net operating loss 
which it carries over to its first separate return year ending after 
December 31, Year 2. L2's separate section 382 limitation with respect 
to this loss is zero unless L elects to apportion all or a part of the 
consolidated section 382 limitation to L2. (See paragraph (c) of this 
section for rules regarding the apportionment of a consolidated section 
382 limitation.) L apportions $50 of the consolidated section 382 
limitation to L2, and the remaining $50 of the consolidated section 382 
limitation stays with the loss group composed of L and L1.
    (ii) On December 31, Year 3, L1 sells its remaining 75 percent stock 
interest in L2 to C, resulting in an ownership change of L2. L2's 
section 382 limitation computed on the change date with respect to the 
value of its stock is $30. Accordingly, L2's section 382 limitation for 
post-change years ending after December 31, Year 3, with respect to its 
pre-change losses, including the consolidated net operating losses 
apportioned to it from the L group, is $30, adjusted for a short taxable 
year, carryforward of unused limitation, or any other adjustment 
required under section 382.

    (c) Apportionment of a consolidated section 382 limitation--(1) In 
general. The common parent may elect to apportion all or any part of a 
consolidated section 382 limitation to a former member (or loss 
subgroup). The common parent also may elect to apportion all or any part 
of the loss group's net unrealized built-in gain to a former member (or 
loss subgroup).
    (2) Amount which may be apportioned--(i) Consolidated section 382 
limitation. The common parent may apportion all or part of each element 
of the consolidated section 382 limitation determined under Sec. 
1.1502-93. For this purpose, the consolidated section 382 limitation 
consists of two elements--
    (A) The value element, which is the element of the limitation 
determined under section 382(b)(1) (relating to value multiplied by the 
long-term tax-exempt rate) without regard to such adjustments as those 
described in section 382(b)(2) (relating to the carryforward of unused 
section 382 limitation), section 382(b)(3)(B)(relating to the section 
382 limitation for the post-change year that includes the change date), 
section 382(h)(relating to built-in gains and section 338 gains), and 
section 382(m)(2)(relating to short taxable years); and
    (B) The adjustment element, which is so much (if any) of the 
limitation for the taxable year during which the former member ceases to 
be a member of the consolidated group that is attributable to a 
carryover of unused limitation under section 382(b)(2) or to recognized 
built-in gains under 382(h).
    (ii) Net unrealized built-in gain. The aggregate amount of the loss 
group's net unrealized built-in gain that may be apportioned to one or 
more former members that cease to be members during the same 
consolidated return year cannot exceed the loss group's excess, 
immediately after the close of that year, of net unrealized built-in 
gain over recognized built-in gain, determined under section 
382(h)(1)(A)(ii) (relating to a limitation on recognized built-in gain). 
For this purpose, net unrealized built-in gain apportioned to former 
members in prior consolidated return years is treated as recognized 
built-in gain in those years.
    (3) Effect of apportionment on the consolidated group--(i) 
Consolidated section 382 limitation. The value element of the 
consolidated section 382 limitation for any post-change year ending 
after the day that a former member (or loss subgroup) ceases to be a 
member(s) is reduced to the extent that it is apportioned under this 
paragraph (c). The consolidated section 382 limitation for the post-
change year in which the former member (or loss subgroup) ceases to be a 
member(s) is also

[[Page 524]]

reduced to the extent that the adjustment element for that year is 
apportioned under this paragraph (c).
    (ii) Net unrealized built-in gain. The amount of the loss group's 
net unrealized built-in gain that is apportioned to the former member 
(or loss subgroup) is treated as recognized built-in gain for a prior 
taxable year ending in the recognition period for purposes of applying 
the limitation of section 382(h)(1)(A)(ii) to the loss group's 
recognition period taxable years beginning after the consolidated return 
year in which the former member (or loss subgroup) ceases to be a 
member.
    (4) Effect on corporations to which an apportionment is made--(i) 
Consolidated section 382 limitation. The amount of the value element 
that is apportioned to a former member (or loss subgroup) is treated as 
the amount determined under section 382(b)(1) for purposes of 
determining the amount of that corporation's (or loss subgroup's) 
section 382 limitation for any taxable year ending after the former 
member (or loss subgroup) ceases to be a member(s). Appropriate 
adjustments must be made to the limitation based on the value element so 
apportioned for a short taxable year, carryforward of unused limitation, 
or any other adjustment required under section 382. The adjustment 
element apportioned to a former member (or loss subgroup) is treated as 
an adjustment under section 382(b)(2) or section 382(h), as appropriate, 
for the first taxable year after the member (or members) ceases to be a 
member (or members).
    (ii) Net unrealized built-in gain. For purposes of determining the 
amount by which the former member's (or loss subgroup's) section 382 
limitation for any taxable year beginning after the former member (or 
loss subgroup) ceases to be a member(s) is increased by its recognized 
built-in gain--
    (A) The amount of net unrealized built-in gain apportioned to a 
former member (or loss subgroup) is treated as if it were an amount of 
net unrealized built-in gain determined under section 
382(h)(1)(A)(i)(without regard to the threshold of section 382(h)(3)(B)) 
with respect to such member or loss subgroup, and that amount is not 
reduced under section 382(h)(1)(A)(ii) by the loss group's recognized 
built-in gain;
    (B) The former member's (or loss subgroup's) 5 year recognition 
period begins on the loss group's change date;
    (C) In applying section 382(h)(1)(A)(ii), the former member (or loss 
subgroup) takes into account only its prior taxable years that begin 
after it ceases to be a member of the loss group; and
    (D) The former member's (or loss subgroup's) recognized built-in 
gain on the disposition of an asset is determined under section 
382(h)(2)(A), treating references to the change date in that section as 
references to the loss group's change date.
    (5) Deemed apportionment when loss group terminates. If a loss group 
terminates, to the extent the consolidated section 382 limitation or net 
unrealized built-in gain is not apportioned under paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section, the consolidated section 382 limitation or net unrealized 
built-in gain is deemed to be apportioned to the loss subgroup that 
includes the common parent, or, if there is no loss subgroup that 
includes the common parent immediately after the loss group terminates, 
to the common parent. A loss group terminates on the first day of the 
first taxable year that is a separate return year with respect to each 
member of the former loss group.
    (6) Appropriate adjustments when former member leaves during the 
year. Appropriate adjustments are made to the consolidated section 382 
limitation for the consolidated return year during which the former 
member (or loss subgroup) ceases to be a member(s) to reflect the 
inclusion of the former member in the loss group for a portion of that 
year.
    (7) Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of 
this paragraph (c):

    Example 1. Consequence of apportionment. (i) L owns all the L1 stock 
and L1 owns all the L2 stock. The L group has a $200 consolidated net 
operating loss arising in Year 1 that is carried over to Year 2. At the 
close of December 31, Year 1, the group has an ownership change under 
Sec. 1.1502-92. The ownership change results in a consolidated section 
382 limitation of $10 based on the value of the stock of the group. On 
August 29, Year 2, L1 sells 30 percent of the stock of L2 to A. L2 is

[[Page 525]]

apportioned $90 of the group's $200 consolidated net operating loss 
under Sec. 1.1502-21(b). L, the common parent, elects to apportion $6 
of the consolidated section 382 limitation to L2. The following is a 
graphic illustration of these facts:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR02JY99.016

    (ii) For its separate return years ending after December 31, Year 2, 
L2's section 382 limitation with respect to the $90 of the group's net 
operating loss apportioned to it is $6, adjusted, as appropriate, for 
any short taxable year, unused section 382 limitation, or other 
adjustment. For its consolidated return year ending December 31, Year 2 
the L group's consolidated section 382 limitation with respect to the 
remaining $110 of pre-change consolidated attribute is $4 ($10 minus the 
$6 value element apportioned to L2), adjusted, as appropriate, for any 
short taxable year, unused section 382 limitation, or other adjustment.
    (iii) For the L group's consolidated return year ending December 31, 
Year 2, the value element of its consolidated section 382 limitation is 
increased by $4 (rounded to the nearest dollar), to account for the 
period during which L2 was a member of the L group ($6, the consolidated 
section 382 limitation apportioned to L2, times 241/365, the ratio of 
the number of days during Year 2 that L2 is a member of the group to the 
number of days in the group's consolidated return year). See paragraph 
(c)(6) of this section. Therefore, the value element of the consolidated 
section 382 limitation for Year 2 of the L group is $8 (rounded to the 
nearest dollar).
    (iv) The section 382 limitation for L2's short taxable year ending 
December 31, Year 2, is $2 (rounded to the nearest dollar), which is the 
amount that bears the same relationship to $6, the value element of the 
consolidated section 382 limitation apportioned to L2, as the number of 
days during that short taxable year, 124 days, bears to 365. See Sec. 
1.382-5(c).
    Example 2. Consequence of no apportionment. The facts are the same 
as in Example 1, except that L does not elect to apportion any portion 
of the consolidated section 382 limitation to L2. For its separate 
return years ending after August 29, Year 2, L2's section 382 limitation 
with respect to the $90 of the group's pre-change consolidated attribute 
apportioned to L2 is zero under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. 
Thus, the $90 consolidated net operating loss apportioned to L2 cannot 
offset L2's taxable income in any of its separate return years ending 
after August 29, Year 2. For its consolidated return

[[Page 526]]

years ending after August 29, Year 2, the L group's consolidated section 
382 limitation with respect to the remaining $110 of pre-change 
consolidated attribute is $10, adjusted, as appropriate, for any short 
taxable year, unused section 382 limitation, or other adjustment.
    Example 3. Apportionment of adjustment element. The facts are the 
same as in Example 1, except that L2 ceases to be a member of the L 
group on August 29, Year 3, and the L group has a $4 carryforward of an 
unused consolidated section 382 limitation (under section 382(b)(2)) to 
the Year 3 consolidated return year. The carryover of unused limitation 
increases the consolidated section 382 limitation for the Year 3 
consolidated return year from $10 to $14. L may elect to apportion all 
or any portion of the $10 value element and all or any portion of the $4 
adjustment element to L2.

    (d) Rules pertaining to ceasing to be a member of a loss subgroup--
(1) In general. A corporation ceases to be a member of a loss subgroup 
on the earlier of--
    (i) The first day of the first taxable year for which it files a 
separate return; or
    (ii) The first day that it ceases to bear a relationship described 
in section 1504(a)(1) to the loss subgroup parent (treating for this 
purpose the loss subgroup parent as the common parent described in 
section 1504(a)(1)(A)).
    (2) Exceptions. Paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section does not apply 
to a member of a loss subgroup while that member remains a member of the 
current group--
    (i) If an election under Sec. 1.1502-91(d)(4)(relating to treating 
the subgroup parent requirement as satisfied) applies to the members of 
the loss subgroup;
    (ii) Starting on the day after the change date (but not earlier than 
the date the loss subgroup becomes a member of the group), if there is 
an ownership change of the loss subgroup within six months before, on, 
or after becoming members of the group; or
    (iii) Starting the day after the period of 5 consecutive years 
following the day that the loss subgroup become members of the group 
during which the loss subgroup has not had an ownership change.
    (3) Examples. The principles of this paragraph (d) are illustrated 
by the following examples:

    Example 1. Basic case. (i) P owns all the L stock, L owns all the L1 
stock and L1 owns all the L2 stock. The P group has a consolidated net 
operating loss arising in Year 1 that is carried over to Year 2. On 
December 11, Year 2, P sells all the stock of L to corporation M. Each 
of L, L1, and L2 is apportioned a portion of the Year 1 consolidated net 
operating loss, and thereafter each joins with M in filing consolidated 
returns. Under Sec. 1.1502-92, the L loss subgroup has an ownership 
change on December 11, Year 2. The L loss subgroup has a subgroup 
section 382 limitation of $100. The following is a graphic illustration 
of these facts:

[[Page 527]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR02JY99.017

    (ii) On May 22, Year 3, L1 sells 40 percent of the L2 stock to A. L2 
carries over a portion of the P group's net operating loss from Year 1 
to its separate return year ending December 31, Year 3. Under paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section, L2 ceases to be a member of the L loss subgroup 
on May 22, Year 3, which is both (1) the first day of the first taxable 
year

[[Page 528]]

for which it files a separate return and (2) the day it ceases to bear a 
relationship described in section 1504(a)(1) to the loss subgroup 
parent, L. The net operating loss of L2 that is carried over from the P 
group is treated as a pre-change loss of L2 for its separate return 
years ending after May 22, Year 3. Under paragraphs (a)(2) and (b)(2) of 
this section, the separate section 382 limitation with respect to this 
loss is zero unless M elects to apportion all or a part of the subgroup 
section 382 limitation of the L loss subgroup to L2.
    Example 2. Formation of a new loss subgroup. The facts are the same 
as in Example 1, except that A purchases 40 percent of the L1 stock from 
L rather than purchasing L2 stock from L1. L1 and L2 file a consolidated 
return for their first taxable year ending after May 22, Year 3, and 
each of L1 and L2 carries over a part of the net operating loss of the P 
group that arose in Year 1. Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, L1 
and L2 cease to be members of the L loss subgroup on May 22, Year 3. The 
net operating losses carried over from the P group are treated as pre-
change subgroup attributes of the loss subgroup composed of L1 and L2. 
The subgroup section 382 limitation with respect to those losses is zero 
unless M elects to apportion all or part of the subgroup section 382 
limitation of the L loss subgroup to the L1 loss subgroup. The following 
is a graphic illustration of these facts:

[[Page 529]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR02JY99.018

    Example 3. Ownership change upon becoming members of the group. (i) 
A owns all the stock of P, and P owns all the stock of L1 and L2. The P 
group has a consolidated net operating loss arising in Year 1 that is 
carried over to Year 3 and Year 4. Corporation M acquires all the stock 
of P on November 11, Year 3, and P, L1, and L2 thereafter file 
consolidated

[[Page 530]]

returns with M. M's acquisition results in an ownership change of the P 
loss subgroup under Sec. 1.1502-92(b)(1)(ii).
    (ii) P distributes the L2 stock to M on October 7, Year 4, and L2 
ceases to bear the relationship described in section 1504(a)(1) to P, 
the P loss subgroup parent. However, under paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section, L2 does not cease to be a member of the P loss subgroup because 
the P loss subgroup had an ownership change upon becoming members of the 
M group and L2 remains in the M group.
    Example 4. Ceasing to bear a section 1504 (a)(1) to the loss 
subgroup parent. (i) A owns all the stock of P, and P owns all the stock 
of L1 and L2. The P group has a consolidated net operating loss arising 
in Year 1 that is carried over to Year 7. At the close of Year 2, X 
acquires all of the stock of P, causing an ownership change of the loss 
subgroup composed of P, L1 and L2 under Sec. 1.1502-92(b)(1)(ii). In 
Year 4, M, which is owned by the same person that owns X, acquires all 
of the stock of P, and the M acquisition does not cause a second 
ownership change of the P loss subgroup.
    (ii) P distributes the L2 stock to M on February 3, Year 6 (less 
than 5 years after the P loss subgroup became members of the M group) 
and L2 ceases to bear the relationship described in section 1504(a)(1) 
to P, the loss subgroup parent. Thus, the section 382 limitation from 
the Year 2 ownership change that applies with respect to the pre-change 
attributes attributable to L2 is zero except to the extent M elects to 
apportion all or part of the P loss subgroup section 382 limitation to 
L2.
    Example 5. Relationship through a successor. The facts are the same 
as in Example 3, except that M's acquisition of the P stock does not 
result in an ownership change of the P loss subgroup, and, instead of 
P's distributing the stock of L2, L2 merges into L1 on October 7, Year 
4. L1 (as successor to L2 in the merger within the meaning of Sec. 
1.1502-1(f)(4)) continues to bear a relationship described in section 
1504(a)(1) to P, the loss subgroup parent. Thus, L2 does not cease to be 
a member of the P loss subgroup as a result of the merger.
    Example 6. Reattribution of net operating loss carryover under Sec. 
1.1502-20(g). The facts are the same as in Example 3, except that, 
instead of distributing the L2 stock to M, P sells that stock to B, and, 
under Sec. 1.1502-20(g), M reattributes $10 of L2's net operating loss 
carryover to itself. Under Sec. 1.1502-20(g), M succeeds to the 
reattributed loss as if the loss were succeeded to in a transaction 
described in section 381(a). M, as successor to L2, does not cease to be 
a member of the P loss subgroup.

    (e) Allocation of net unrealized built-in loss--(1) In general. This 
paragraph (e) provides rules for the allocation of a loss group's (or 
loss subgroup's) net unrealized built-in loss if a member ceases to be a 
member of a loss group (or loss subgroup). This paragraph (e) applies 
if--
    (i) A loss group (or loss subgroup) has a net unrealized built-in 
loss on a change date; and
    (ii) Immediately after the close of the consolidated return year in 
which the departing member ceases to be a member, the amount of the loss 
group's (or loss subgroup's) excess of net unrealized built-in loss over 
recognized built-in loss, determined under section 382(h)(1)(B)(ii) 
(relating to a limitation on recognized built-in loss), is greater than 
zero. (The amount of such excess is referred to as the remaining NUBIL 
balance.) In applying section 382(h)(1)(B)(ii) for this purpose, net 
unrealized built-in loss allocated to departing members in prior 
consolidated return years is treated as recognized built-in loss in 
those years.
    (2) Amount of allocation--(i) In general. The amount of net 
unrealized built-in loss allocated to a departing member is equal to the 
remaining NUBIL balance, multiplied by a fraction. The numerator of the 
fraction is the amount of the built-in loss, taken into account on the 
change date under Sec. 1.1502-91(g), in the assets held by the 
departing member immediately after the member ceases to be a member of 
the loss group (or loss subgroup). The denominator of the fraction is 
the sum of the numerator, plus the amount of the built-in loss, taken 
into account under Sec. 1.1502-91(g) on the change date, in the assets 
held by the loss group (or loss subgroup) immediately after the close of 
the taxable year in which the departing member ceases to be a member. 
(Fluctuations in value of the assets between the change date and the 
date that the member ceases to be a member of the group (or loss 
subgroup), or the close of the taxable year in which the member ceases 
to be a member of the loss group, are disregarded.) Because the amount 
of built-in loss on the change date with respect to a departing member's 
assets is taken into account (rather than that member's separately 
computed net unrealized built-in loss

[[Page 531]]

on the change date), a departing member can be apportioned all or part 
of the loss group's net unrealized built-in loss, even if the departing 
member had a separately computed net unrealized built-in gain on the 
change date. Amounts taken into account under section 382(h)(6)(C) 
(relating to certain deduction items) are treated as if they were assets 
in determining the numerator and denominator of the fraction.
    (ii) Transferred basis property and deferred gain or loss. For 
purposes of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, assets held by the 
departing member immediately after it ceases to be a member of the group 
(or by other members immediately after the close of the taxable year) 
include--
    (A) Assets held at that time that are transferred basis property 
that was held by any member of the group (or loss subgroup) on the 
change date; and
    (B) Assets held at that time by any member of the consolidated group 
with respect to which gain or loss of the group member or loss subgroup 
member at issue has been deferred in an intercompany transaction and has 
not been taken into account.
    (iii) Assets for which gain or loss has been recognized. For 
purposes of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, assets held by the 
departing member immediately after it ceases to be a member of the group 
(or by other members immediately after the close of the taxable year) do 
not include assets with respect to which gain or loss has previously 
been recognized and taken into account during the recognition period 
(including gain or loss recognized in an intercompany transaction and 
taken into account immediately before the member leaves the group). 
Appropriate adjustments must be made if gain or loss on an asset has 
been only partially recognized and taken into account.
    (iv) Exchanged basis property. The rules of Sec. 1.1502-91(h) apply 
for purposes of this paragraph (e) (disregarding stock received from the 
departing member or another member that is a member immediately after 
the close of the taxable year).
    (v) Two or more members depart during the same year. If two or more 
members cease to be members during the same consolidated return year, 
appropriate adjustments must be made to the denominator of the fraction 
for each departing member by treating the other departing members as if 
they had not ceased to be members during that year and as if the assets 
held by those other departing members immediately after they cease to be 
members of the group (or loss subgroup) are assets held by the group 
immediately after the close of the taxable year.
    (vi) Anti-abuse rule. If assets are transferred between members or a 
member ceases to be a member with a principal purpose of causing or 
affecting the allocation of amounts under this paragraph (e), 
appropriate adjustments must be made to eliminate any benefit of such 
acquisition, disposition, or allocation.
    (3) Effect of allocation on the consolidated group. The amount of 
the net unrealized built-in loss that is allocated to the former member 
is treated as recognized built-in loss for a prior taxable year ending 
in the recognition period for purposes applying the limitation of 
section 382(h)(1)(B)(ii) to a loss group's (or loss subgroup's) 
recognition period taxable years beginning after the consolidated return 
year in which the former member ceases to be a member.
    (4) Effect on corporations to which the allocation is made. For 
purposes of determining the amount of the former member's recognized 
built-in losses in any taxable year beginning after the former member 
ceases to be a member--
    (i) The amount of the loss group's (or loss subgroup's) net 
unrealized built-in loss that is allocated to the former member is 
treated as if it were an amount of net unrealized built-in loss 
determined under section 382(h)(1)(B)(i)(without regard to the threshold 
of section 382(h)(3)(B)) with respect to such member or loss subgroup, 
and that amount is not reduced under section 382(h)(1)(B)(ii) by the 
loss group's (or loss subgroup's) recognized built-in losses;
    (ii) The former member's 5 year recognition period begins on the 
loss group's (or loss subgroup's) change date;
    (iii) In applying section 382(h)(1)(B)(ii), the former member

[[Page 532]]

takes into account only its prior taxable years that begin after it 
ceases to be a member of the loss group (or loss subgroup); and
    (iv) The former member's recognized built-in loss on the disposition 
of an asset is determined under section 382(h)(2)(B), treating 
references to the change date in that section as references to the loss 
group's (or loss subgroup's) change date.
    (5) Subgroup principles. If two or more former members are members 
of the same consolidated group (the second group) immediately after they 
cease to be members of the current group, the principles of paragraphs 
(e)(1), (2) and (4) of this section apply to those former members on an 
aggregate basis. Thus, for example, the amount of net unrealized built-
in loss allocated to those members is based on the assets held by those 
members immediately after they cease to be members of the current group 
and the limitation of section 382(h)(1)(B)(ii) on recognized built-in 
losses is applied by taking into account the aggregate amount of net 
unrealized built-in loss allocated to the former members and the 
aggregate recognized losses of those members in taxable years beginning 
after they cease to be members of the current group. If one or more of 
such members cease to be members of the second group, the principles of 
this paragraph (e) are applied with respect to those members to allocate 
to them all or part of any remaining unrecognized amount of net 
unrealized built-in loss allocated to the members that became members of 
the second group.
    (6) Apportionment of consolidated section 382 limitation (or 
subgroup section 382 limitation)--(i) In general. For rules relating to 
the apportionment of a consolidated section 382 limitation (or subgroup 
section 382 limitation) to a former member, see paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (ii) Special rule for former members that become members of the same 
consolidated group. If recognized built-in losses of one or more former 
members would be subject to a consolidated section 382 limitation (or 
subgroup section 382 limitation) if recognized immediately before the 
member (or members) cease to be members of the group, an apportionment 
of that limitation may be made, under paragraph (c) of this section, to 
a loss subgroup that includes such member (or members), and the 
recognized built-in losses (if any) of that member (or members) will be 
subject to that apportioned limitation. If two or more of such former 
members are not included in a loss subgroup immediately after they cease 
to be members of the group (for example, because they do not have net 
operating loss carryovers or, in the aggregate, a net unrealized built-
in loss), but are members of the same consolidated group, an 
apportionment of the consolidated section 382 limitation (or subgroup 
section 382 limitation) may be made to them as if they were a loss 
subgroup.
    (7) Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of 
this paragraph (e):

    Example 1. Basic allocation case. (i) P owns all of the stock of L1 
and L2. On September 4, Year 1, A purchases all of the P stock, causing 
an ownership change of the P group. On that date P has two assets (other 
than the L1 and L2 stock), asset 1 with an adjusted basis of $40 and a 
fair market value of $15 and asset 2 with an adjusted basis of $50 and a 
fair market value of $100. L1 has two assets, asset 3 , with a fair 
market value of $50 and an adjusted basis of $100, and asset 4, with an 
adjusted basis of $125 and a fair market value of $75. L2 has two 
assets, asset 5, with a fair market value of $150 and an adjusted basis 
of $100, and asset 6, with an adjusted basis of $90 and a fair market 
value of $40. Thus, the P loss group has a net unrealized built-in loss 
of $75.
    (ii) On March 19, Year 3, P sells all of the L2 stock to M. At that 
time, asset 5, which has appreciated in value, has a fair market value 
of $250 and an adjusted basis of $100. Asset 6, which has declined in 
value, has an adjusted basis of $90 and a fair market value of $10.
    (iii) On April 8, Year 3, P sells asset 1, and has a recognized 
built-in loss of $25 that is subject to the P group's section 382 
limitation. On November 11, Year 4, L2 sells asset 6 for its then fair 
market value, $10, recognizing a loss of $80. On June 3, Year 5, L1 
sells asset 4, recognizing a loss of $50.
    (iv) Immediately after the close of Year 3, the P loss group's 
remaining NUBIL balance is $50 ($75 net unrealized built-in loss reduced 
by the $25 recognized built-in loss of P). The portion of the remaining 
NUBIL balance that is allocated to L2 is $17 (rounded to the nearest 
dollar). Seventeen dollars is the

[[Page 533]]

product obtained by multiplying $50 (the remaining NUBIL balance) by 
$50/$150. The numerator of the fraction ($50) is the amount of built-in 
loss in asset 6, taken into account on the change date under Sec. 
1.1502-91(g). The denominator ($150) is the sum of the numerator ($50) 
and the amount of built-in loss in assets 3 and 4, taken into account on 
the change date under Sec. 1.1502-91(g) ($100). The built-in loss in 
asset 1 is not included in the denominator of the fraction because it is 
not held by the P group immediately after the close of Year 3.
    (v) Seventeen dollars of L2's $80 loss on the sale of asset 6 is a 
recognized built-in loss and subject to a section 382 limitation of 
zero, unless P apportions some or all of the P group's consolidated 
section 382 limitation to L2 (adjusted for a short taxable year, 
carryover of unused limitation, or any other adjustment required under 
section 382).
    (vi) Thirty-three dollars of L1's $50 loss on the sale of asset 4 is 
subject to the P group's consolidated section 382 limitation, reduced by 
the amount of such limitation apportioned to L2, and adjusted for any 
short taxable year, a carryforward of unused limitation, or other 
adjustment. (In applying section 382(h)(1)(B)(ii) with respect to Year 
5, the P group's net unrealized built-in loss is reduced by P's $25 
recognized built-in loss in Year 3 and the $17 of net unrealized built-
in loss allocated to L2, thus limiting the P group's recognized built-in 
loss in Year 5 to $33.)
    Example 2. Two members depart in the same year. The facts are the 
same as in Example 1, except that P sells all of the stock of L1 to C on 
November 1, Year 3. The amount of net unrealized built-in loss 
apportioned to L2 (rounded to the nearest dollar) is $17 ($50 remaining 
NUBIL balance x $50/$150). The amount of net unrealized built-in loss 
apportioned to L1 (rounded to the nearest dollar) is $33 ($50 remaining 
NUBIL balance x $100/$150).

    (8) Reporting requirement. If a net unrealized built-in loss is 
allocated under this paragraph (e), the common parent must file a 
statement with its income tax return for the taxable year in which the 
former member(s) (or a new loss subgroup that includes that member) 
ceases to be a member. The statement must provide the name and employer 
identification number (E.I.N.) of the departing member, the amount of 
remaining NUBIL balance for the taxable year in which the member 
departs, and the amount of the net unrealized built-in loss allocated to 
the departing member. The common parent must also deliver a copy of the 
statement to the former member on or before the day the group files its 
income tax return for the consolidated return year that the former 
member ceases to be a member. A copy of the statement must be attached 
to the first income tax return of the former member (or the first return 
in which the former member joins) that is filed after the close of the 
consolidated return year of the group of which the former member (or a 
new loss subgroup that includes that member) cease to be a member. This 
paragraph (e)(8) does not apply if the required information (other than 
the amount of remaining NUBIL balance) is included in a statement of 
election under paragraph (f) of this section (relating to apportioning a 
section 382 limitation).
    (f) Filing the election to apportion the section 382 limitation and 
net unrealized built-in gain--(1) Form of the election to apportion. An 
election under paragraph (c) of this section must be made by the common 
parent. The election must be made in the form of the following 
statement: ``THIS IS AN ELECTION UNDER Sec. 1.1502-95 OF THE INCOME TAX 
REGULATIONS TO APPORTION ALL OR PART OF THE [insert THE CONSOLIDATED 
SECTION 382 LIMITATION, THE SUBGROUP SECTION 382 LIMITATION, THE LOSS 
GROUP'S NET UNREALIZED BUILT-IN GAIN, THE LOSS SUBGROUP'S NET UNREALIZED 
BUILT-IN GAIN, as appropriate] TO [insert name and E.I.N. of the 
corporation (or the corporations that compose a new loss subgroup) to 
which allocation is made]''. The declaration must also include the 
following information, as appropriate--
    (i) The date of the ownership change that resulted in the 
consolidated section 382 limitation (or subgroup section 382 limitation) 
or the loss group's (or loss subgroup's) net unrealized built-in gain;
    (ii) The amount of the departing member's (or loss subgroup's) pre-
change net operating loss carryovers and the taxable years in which they 
arose that will be subject to the limitation that is being apportioned 
to that member (or loss subgroup);
    (iii) The amount of any net unrealized built-in loss allocated to 
the departing member (or loss subgroup) under paragraph (e) of this 
section,

[[Page 534]]

which, if recognized, can be a pre-change attribute subject to the 
limitation that is being apportioned;
    (iv) If a consolidated section 382 limitation (or subgroup section 
382 limitation) is being apportioned, the amount of the consolidated 
section 382 limitation (or subgroup section 382 limitation) for the 
taxable year during which the former member (or new loss subgroup) 
ceases to be a member of the consolidated group (determined without 
regard to any apportionment under this section);
    (v) If any net unrealized built-in gain is being apportioned, the 
amount of the loss group's (or loss subgroup's) net unrealized built-in 
gain (as determined under paragraph (c) (2)(ii) of this section) that 
may be apportioned to members that ceased to be members during the 
consolidated return year;
    (vi) The amount of the value element and adjustment element of the 
consolidated section 382 limitation (or subgroup section 382 limitation) 
that is apportioned to the former member (or new loss subgroup) pursuant 
to paragraph (c) of this section;
    (vii) The amount of the loss group's (or loss subgroup's) net 
unrealized built-in gain that is apportioned to the former member (or 
new loss subgroup) pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section;
    (viii) If the former member is allocated any net unrealized built-in 
loss under paragraph (e) of this section, the amount of any adjustment 
element apportioned to the former member that is attributable to 
recognized built-in gains (determined in a manner that will enable both 
the group and the former member to apply the principles of Sec. 1.1502-
93(c));
    (ix) The name and E.I.N. of the common parent making the 
apportionment.
    (2) Signing of the election. The election statement must be signed 
by both the common parent and the former member (or, in the case of a 
loss subgroup, the common parent and the loss subgroup parent) by 
persons authorized to sign their respective income tax returns. If the 
allocation is made to a loss subgroup for which an election under Sec. 
1.1502-91(d)(4) is made, and not separately to its members, the election 
statement under this paragraph (e) must be signed by the common parent 
and any member of the new loss subgroup by persons authorized to sign 
their respective income tax returns.
    (3) Filing of the election. The election statement must be filed by 
the common parent of the group that is apportioning the consolidated 
section 382 limitation (or the subgroup section 382 limitation) or the 
loss group's net unrealized built-in gain (or loss subgroup's net 
unrealized built-in gain) with its income tax return for the taxable 
year in which the former member (or new loss subgroup) ceases to be a 
member. The common parent must also deliver a copy of the statement to 
the former member (or the members of the new loss subgroup) on or before 
the day the group files its income tax return for the consolidated 
return year that the former member (or new loss subgroup) ceases to be a 
member. A copy of the statement must be attached to the first return of 
the former member (or the first return in which the members of a new 
loss subgroup join) that is filed after the close of the consolidated 
return year of the group of which the former member (or the members of a 
new loss subgroup) ceases to be a member.
    (4) Revocation of election. An election statement made under 
paragraph (c) of this section is revocable only with the consent of the 
Commissioner.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1502-96  Miscellaneous rules.

    (a) End of separate tracking of losses--(1) Application. This 
paragraph (a) applies to a member (or a loss subgroup) with a net 
operating loss carryover that arose (or is treated under Sec. 1.1502-
21(c) as arising) in a SRLY, or a member (or loss subgroup) with a net 
unrealized built-in loss determined at the time that the member (or loss 
subgroup) becomes a member of the consolidated group if there is--
    (i) An ownership change of the member (or loss subgroup) within six 
months before, on, or after becoming a member of the group; or
    (ii) A period of 5 consecutive years following the day that the 
member (or loss subgroup) becomes a member of a group during which the 
member (or

[[Page 535]]

loss subgroup) has not had an ownership change.
    (2) Effect of end of separate tracking--(i) Net operating loss 
carryovers. If this paragraph (a) applies with respect to a member (or 
loss subgroup) with a net operating loss carryover, then, starting on 
the day after the earlier of the change date (but not earlier than the 
day the member (or loss subgroup) becomes a member of the consolidated 
group) or the last day of the 5 consecutive year period described in 
paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, such loss carryover is treated as 
described in Sec. 1.1502-91(c)(1)(i). The preceding sentence also 
applies for purposes of determining whether there is an ownership change 
with respect to such loss carryover following such change date or 5 
consecutive year period. Thus, for example, starting the day after the 
change date (but not earlier than the day the member (or loss subgroup) 
becomes a member of the consolidated group) or the end of the 5 
consecutive year period--
    (A) The consolidated group which includes the new loss member or 
loss subgroup is no longer required to separately track owner shifts of 
the stock of the new loss member or subgroup parent to determine if an 
ownership change occurs with respect to the loss carryover of the new 
loss member or members included in the loss subgroup;
    (B) The group is a loss group because the member's loss carryover is 
treated as a loss described in Sec. 1.1502-91(c)(1)(i);
    (C) There is an ownership change with respect to such loss carryover 
only if the group has an ownership change; and
    (D) If the group has an ownership change, such loss carryover is a 
pre-change consolidated attribute subject to the loss group's 
consolidated section 382 limitation.
    (ii) Net unrealized built-in losses. If this paragraph (a) applies 
with respect to a new loss member described in Sec. 1.1502-94(a)(1)(ii) 
(or a loss subgroup described in Sec. 1.1502-91(d)(2)) then, starting 
on the day after the earlier of the change date (but not earlier than 
the day the member (or loss subgroup) becomes a member of the group) or 
the last day of the 5 consecutive year period described in paragraph 
(a)(1)(ii) of this section, the member (or members of the loss subgroup) 
are treated, for purposes of applying Sec. 1.1502-91(g)(2)(ii), as if 
they have been affiliated with the common parent for 5 consecutive 
years. Starting on that day, the member's (or the members of the loss 
subgroup's) separately computed net unrealized built-in loss is included 
in the determination whether the group has a net unrealized built-in 
loss, and there is an ownership change with respect to the member's 
separately computed net unrealized built-in loss only if the group 
(including the member) has a net unrealized built-in loss and has an 
ownership change. Thus, for example, starting the day after the change 
date (but not earlier than the day the member (or loss subgroup) becomes 
a member of the consolidated group), or the end of the 5 consecutive 
period
    (A) The consolidated group which includes the new loss member or 
loss subgroup is no longer required to separately track owner shifts of 
the stock of the new loss member or subgroup parent to determine if an 
ownership change occurs with respect to the net unrealized built-in loss 
of the new loss member or members of the loss subgroup;
    (B) The group includes the member's (or the loss subgroup members') 
separately computed net unrealized built-in loss in determining whether 
it is a loss group under Sec. 1.1502-91(c)(1)(iii);
    (C) There is an ownership change with respect to such net unrealized 
built-in loss only if the group is a loss group and has an ownership 
change; and
    (D) If the group has an ownership change, the member's separately 
computed net unrealized built-in loss and its assets are taken into 
account in determining the group's pre-change consolidated attributes 
described in Sec. 1.1502-91(e)(1) (relating to recognized built-in 
losses) that are subject to the group's consolidated section 382 
limitation.
    (iii) Common parent not common parent for five years. If the common 
parent has become the common parent of an existing group within the 
previous 5-year period in a transaction described in Sec. 1.1502-
75(d)(2)(ii) or (3), appropriate adjustments must be made in applying

[[Page 536]]

paragraphs (a)(2)(ii) and (3) of this section. In such a case, as the 
context requires, references to the common parent are to the former 
common parent.
    (3) Continuing effect of end of separate tracking--(i) In general. 
As the context may require, a current group determines which of its 
members are included in a loss subgroup on any testing date by taking 
into account the application of this section in the former group. See 
the example in Sec. 1.1502-91(f)(2). For this purpose, corporations 
that are treated under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section as having 
been affiliated with the common parent of the former group for 5 
consecutive years are also treated as having been affiliated with any 
other members that have been (or are treated as having been) affiliated 
with the common parent. The corporations are treated as having been 
affiliated with such other members for the same period of time that 
those members have been (or are treated as having been) affiliated with 
the common parent. If two or more corporations become members of the 
group at the same time, but paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not 
apply to every such corporation, then immediately after the corporations 
become members of the group, the corporations to which paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section applied are treated as not having been previously 
affiliated, for purposes of applying this paragraph (a)(3), with the 
corporations to which paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section did not 
apply.
    (ii) Example. The following example illustrates the principles of 
this paragraph (a)(3):

    Example. (i) L has owned all the stock of L1 for three years. At the 
close of December 31, Year 1, the M group purchases all the L stock, and 
L and L1 become members of the M group. Other than the stock of L1, L 
has one asset (the L loss asset) with a net unrealized built-in loss of 
$200 on this date. L1 has one asset with a net unrealized built-in gain 
of $50 (the L1 gain asset). L and L1 do not compose a loss subgroup 
because they do not meet the five year affiliation requirement of Sec. 
1.1502-91(d)(2)(i). L is a new loss member, and M's purchase of L causes 
an ownership change of L. At the close of December 31, Year 4, at a time 
when L1 has been affiliated with the M group for three years and has 
been affiliated with L for six years, the S group purchases all the M 
stock. On this date, the L loss asset has a net unrealized built-in loss 
of $300, the L1 gain asset has a net unrealized built-in gain of $80, 
and M, the common parent of the M group, has one asset with a net 
unrealized built-in gain of $200.
    (ii) Paragraph (a)(1) of this section applies to L because L is a 
new loss member described in Sec. 1.1502-94(a)(1)(ii) that has an 
ownership change upon becoming a member of the M group on December 31, 
Year 1. Accordingly, L is treated as having been affiliated with M for 5 
consecutive years, and the L loss asset with a net unrealized built-in 
loss of $300 is included in the determination whether the M group has a 
net unrealized built-in loss.
    (iii) The S group determines which of its members are included in a 
loss subgroup by taking into account application of paragraph (a) of 
this section in the M group. For this purpose, application of paragraph 
(a) of this section causes L to be treated as having been affiliated 
with M (or as having been a member of the M group) for 5 consecutive 
years as of January 1, Year 2. Therefore, the S group includes L in the 
determination whether the M subgroup acquired by S on December 31, Year 
4, has a net unrealized built-in loss.
    (iv) Because paragraph (a)(1) of this section applied to L when L 
became a member of the M group, but did not apply to L1, L is treated as 
not having been affiliated with L1 before L and L1 joined the M group. 
Also, L1 is not included in the determination whether the M subgroup has 
a net unrealized built-in loss because L1 has not been continuously 
affiliated with members of the M group for the five consecutive year 
period ending immediately before they become members of the S group. See 
Sec. 1.1502-91(g)(2).

    (4) Special rule for testing period. For purposes of determining the 
beginning of the testing period for a loss group, the member's (or loss 
subgroup's) net operating loss carryovers (or net unrealized built-in 
loss) described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section are considered to 
arise--
    (i) In a case described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, in a 
taxable year that begins not earlier than the later of the day following 
the change date or the day that the member becomes a member of the 
group; and
    (ii) In a case described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, in 
a taxable year that begins 3 years before the end of the 5 consecutive 
year period.
    (5) Limits on effects of end of separate tracking. The rule 
contained in this paragraph (a) applies solely for purposes of 
Sec. Sec. 1.1502-91 through 1.1502-95 and this section (other than 
paragraph

[[Page 537]]

(b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section (relating to the definition of pre-change 
attributes of a subsidiary)) and Sec. 1.1502-98, and not for purposes 
of other provisions of the consolidated return regulations. However, the 
rule contained in this paragraph (a) does apply in Sec. Sec. 1.1502-
15(g), 1.1502-21(g) and 1.1502-22(g) for purposes of determining the 
composition of loss subgroups defined in Sec. 1.1502-91(d). See also 
paragraph (c) of this section for the continuing effect of an ownership 
change with respect to pre-change attributes.
    (b) Ownership change of subsidiary--(1) Ownership change of a 
subsidiary because of options or plan or arrangement. Notwithstanding 
Sec. 1.1502-92, a subsidiary may have an ownership change for purposes 
of section 382 with respect to its attributes which a group or loss 
subgroup includes in making a determination under Sec. 1.1502-91(c)(1) 
(relating to the definition of loss group) or Sec. 1.1502-91(d) 
(relating to the definition of loss subgroup). The subsidiary has such 
an ownership change if it has an ownership change under the principles 
of Sec. 1.1502-95(b) and section 382 and the regulations thereunder 
(determined on a separate entity basis by treating the subsidiary as not 
being a member of a consolidated group) in the event of--
    (i) The deemed exercise under Sec. 1.382-4(d) of an option or 
options (other than an option with respect to stock of the common 
parent) held by a person (or persons acting pursuant to a plan or 
arrangement) to acquire more than 20 percent of the stock of the 
subsidiary; or
    (ii) An increase by 1 or more 5-percent shareholders, acting 
pursuant to a plan or arrangement to avoid an ownership change of a 
subsidiary, in their percentage ownership interest in the subsidiary by 
more than 50 percentage points during the testing period of the 
subsidiary through the acquisition (or deemed acquisition pursuant to 
Sec. 1.382-4(d)) of ownership interests in the subsidiary and in 
higher-tier members with respect to the subsidiary.
    (2) Effect of the ownership change--(i) In general. If a subsidiary 
has an ownership change under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the 
amount of consolidated taxable income for any post-change year that may 
be offset by the pre-change losses of the subsidiary shall not exceed 
the section 382 limitation for the subsidiary. For purposes of this 
limitation, the value of the subsidiary is determined solely by 
reference to the value of the subsidiary's stock.
    (ii) Pre-change losses. The pre-change losses of a subsidiary are--
    (A) Its allocable part of any consolidated net operating loss which 
is attributable to it under Sec. 1.1502-21(b) (determined on the last 
day of the consolidated return year that includes the change date) that 
is not carried back and absorbed in a taxable year prior to the year 
including the change date;
    (B) Its net operating loss carryovers that arose (or are treated 
under Sec. 1.1502-21(c) as having arisen) in a SRLY; and
    (C) Its recognized built-in loss with respect to its separately 
computed net unrealized built-in loss, if any, determined on the change 
date.
    (3) Coordination with Sec. Sec. 1.1502-91, 1.1502-92, and 1.1502-
94. If an increase in percentage ownership interest causes an ownership 
change with respect to an attribute under this paragraph (b) and under 
Sec. 1.1502-92 on the same day, the ownership change is considered to 
occur only under Sec. 1.1502-92 and not under this paragraph (b). See 
Sec. 1.1502-94 for anti-duplication rules relating to value.
    (4) Example. The following example illustrates paragraph (b)(1)(ii) 
of this section:

    Example. Plan to avoid an ownership change of a subsidiary. (i) L 
owns all the stock of L1, L1 owns all the stock of L2, L2 owns all the 
stock of L3, and L3 owns all the stock of L4. The L group has a 
consolidated net operating loss arising in Year 1 that is carried over 
to Year 2. L has assets other than its L1 stock with a value of $900. 
L1, L2, and L3 own no assets other than their L2, L3, and L4 stock. L4 
has assets with a value of $100. During Year 2, A, B, C, and D, acting 
pursuant to a plan to avoid an ownership change of L4, acquire the 
following ownership interests in the members of the L loss group: (A) on 
September 11, Year 2, A acquires 20 percent of the L1 stock from L and B 
acquires 20 percent of the L2 stock from L1; and (B) on September 20, 
Year 2, C acquires 20 percent of the stock of L3 from L2 and D acquires 
20 percent of the stock of L4 from L3.

[[Page 538]]

    (ii) The acquisitions by A, B, C, and D pursuant to the plan have 
increased their respective percentage ownership interests in L4 by 
approximately 10, 13, 16, and 20 percentage points, for a total of 
approximately 59 percentage points during the testing period. This more 
than 50 percentage point increase in the percentage ownership interest 
in L4 causes an ownership change of L4 under paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section.

    (c) Continuing effect of an ownership change. A loss corporation (or 
loss subgroup) that is subject to a limitation under section 382 with 
respect to its pre-change losses continues to be subject to the 
limitation regardless of whether it becomes a member or ceases to be a 
member of a consolidated group. See Sec. 1.382-5(d) (relating to 
successive ownership changes and absorption of a section 382 
limitation).
    (d) Losses reattributed under Sec. 1.1502-20(g)--(1) In general. 
This paragraph (d) contains rules relating to net operating carryovers 
that are reattributed to the common parent under Sec. 1.1502-20(g). 
References in this paragraph (d) to a subsidiary are references to the 
subsidiary (or lower tier subsidiary) whose net operating loss carryover 
is reattributed to the common parent.
    (2) Deemed section 381(a) transaction. Under Sec. 1.1502-20 (g)(1), 
the common parent succeeds to the reattributed losses as if the losses 
were succeeded to in a transaction described in section 381(a). In 
general, Sec. Sec. 1.1502-91 through 1.1502-95, this section, and Sec. 
1.1502-98 are applied to the reattributed net operating loss carryovers 
in accordance with that characterization. See generally, Sec. 1.382-
2(a)(1)(ii) (relating to distributor or transferor loss corporations in 
transactions under section 381), Sec. 1.1502-(1)(f)(4) (relating to the 
definition of predecessor and successor) and Sec. 1.1502-91(j) 
(relating to predecessor and successor corporations). For example, if 
the reattributed net operating loss carryover is a pre-change attribute 
subject to a section 382 limitation, it remains subject to that 
limitation following the reattribution. In certain cases, the limitation 
applicable to the reattributed loss is zero unless the common parent 
apportions all or part of the limitation to itself. (See paragraph 
(d)(4) of this section.)
    (3) Rules relating to owner shifts--(i) In general. Any owner shift 
of the subsidiary (including any deemed owner shift resulting from 
section 382(g)(4)(D) or 382(l)(3)) in connection with the disposition of 
the stock of the subsidiary is not taken into account in determining 
whether there is an ownership change with respect to the reattributed 
net operating loss carryover. However, any owner shift with respect to 
the successor corporation that is treated as continuing in existence 
under Sec. 1.382-2(a)(1)(ii) must be taken into account for such 
purpose if such owner shift is effected by the reattribution and an 
owner shift of the stock of the subsidiary not held directly or 
indirectly by the common parent would have been taken into account if 
such shift had occurred immediately before the reattribution. See 
paragraph (d)(3)(ii) Example 2 of this section.
    (ii) Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of 
this paragraph (d)(3):

    Example 1. No owner shift for reattributed loss. (i) P, the common 
parent of a consolidated group, owns 60% of the stock of L, and B owns 
the remaining 40%. L has a net operating loss carryover of $100 from 
year 1 that it carries over to Years 2, 3, and 4. At the beginning of 
Year 2, P purchases 40% of the L stock from B, which does not cause an 
ownership change of L. On December 31, Year 3, P sells all of the L 
stock to M. Pursuant to Sec. 1.1502-20(g), P reattributes $10 of L's 
$100 net operating loss carryover to itself, and L carries $90 of its 
net operating loss carryover to its Year 4.
    (ii) The sale of the L stock to M does not cause an owner shift that 
is taken into account in determining if there is an ownership change 
with respect to the $10 reattributed loss. Following the reattribution, 
Sec. 1.1502-94(b) continues to apply to determine if there is an 
ownership change with respect to the $10 reattributed loss, until, under 
paragraph (a) of this section, the loss is treated as described in Sec. 
1.1502-91(c)(1)(i). In applying Sec. 1.1502-94(b), the 40 percentage 
point increase by the P shareholders prior to the reattribution is taken 
into account. The sale of the L stock to M does cause an ownership 
change of L with respect to the $90 of its net operating loss that it 
carries over to Year 4.
    Example 2. Owner shift for reattributed loss. The facts are the same 
as in Example 1, except that P only purchases 20% of the L stock from B 
and sells 80% of the L stock to M. L is a new loss member, and, under 
Sec. 1.1502-94(b)(1), an owner shift of the stock of L not held 
directly or indirectly by the common parent (the 20% of L stock still 
held by B) would have been taken into account if

[[Page 539]]

such shift had occurred immediately before the reattribution. Following 
the reattribution, Sec. 1.1502-94(b) continues to apply to determine if 
there is an ownership change with respect to the $10 reattributed loss, 
until, under paragraph (a) of this section, the loss is treated as 
described in Sec. 1.1502-91(c)(1)(i). With respect to the $10 
reattributed loss, the P shareholders have increased their percentage 
ownership interest by 40 percentage points. The P shareholders have 
increased their ownership interests by 20 percentage points as a result 
of P's purchase of stock from B, and, under Sec. 1.382-2(a)(1)(ii), are 
treated as increasing their interests by an additional 20 percentage 
points as a result of the reattribution. (The acquisition of the L stock 
by M does not, however, effect an owner shift for the $10 of 
reattributed loss.) The sale of the L stock to M causes an ownership 
change of L with respect to the $90 of net operating loss that L carries 
over to Year 4.

    (4) Rules relating to the section 382 limitation--(i) Reattributed 
loss is a pre-change separate attribute of a new loss member. If the 
reattributed net operating loss carryover is a pre-change separate 
attribute of a new loss member that is subject to a separate section 382 
limitation prior to the disposition of subsidiary stock, the common 
parent's limitation with respect to that loss is zero, except to the 
extent that the common parent apportions to itself, under paragraph 
(d)(5) of this section, all or part of such limitation. A separate 
section 382 limitation is the limitation described in Sec. 1.1502-94(b) 
that applies to a pre-change separate attribute.
    (ii) Reattributed loss is a pre-change subgroup attribute. If the 
reattributed net operating loss carryover is a pre-change subgroup 
attribute subject to a subgroup section 382 limitation prior to the 
disposition of subsidiary stock, and, immediately after the 
reattribution, the common parent is not a member of the loss subgroup, 
the section 382 limitation with respect to that net operating loss 
carryover is zero, except to the extent that the common parent 
apportions to itself, under paragraph (d)(5) of this section, all or 
part of the subgroup section 382 limitation. See, however, Sec. 1.1502-
95(d)(3) Example 6, for an illustration of a case where the common 
parent, as successor to the subsidiary, is a member of the loss subgroup 
immediately after the reattribution.
    (iii) Potential application of section 382(l)(1). In general, the 
value of the stock of the common parent is used to determine the section 
382 limitation for an ownership change with respect to the reattributed 
net operating loss carryover that occurs at the time of, or after, the 
reattribution. For example, if the net operating loss carryover is a 
pre-change consolidated attribute, the value of the stock of the common 
parent is used to determine the section 382 limitation, and no 
adjustment to that value is required because of the deemed section 
381(a) transaction. However, if the net operating loss carryover is a 
pre-change separate attribute of a new loss member (or is a pre-change 
attribute of a loss subgroup member and the common parent was not the 
loss subgroup parent immediately before the reattribution), the deemed 
section 381(a) transaction is considered to constitute a capital 
contribution with respect to the new loss member (or loss subgroup 
member) for purposes of section 382(l)(1). Accordingly, if that section 
applies because the deemed capital contribution is (or is considered 
under section 382(l)(1)(B) to be) part of a plan described in section 
382(l)(1)(A), the value of the stock of the common parent after the 
deemed section 381(a) transaction must be adjusted to reflect the 
capital contribution. Ordinarily, this will require the value of the 
stock of the common parent to be reduced to an amount that represents 
the value of the stock of the subsidiary (or loss subgroup of which the 
subsidiary was a member) when the reattribution occurred.
    (iv) Duplication or omission of value. In determining any section 
382 limitation with respect to the reattributed net operating loss 
carryover and with respect to other pre-change losses, appropriate 
adjustments must be made so that value is not improperly omitted or 
duplicated as a result of the reattribution. For example, if the 
subsidiary has an ownership change upon its departure, and the common 
parent (as successor) has an ownership change with respect to the 
reattributed pre-change separate attribute upon its reattribution under 
paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this

[[Page 540]]

section, proper adjustments must be made so that the value of the 
subsidiary is not taken into account more than once in determinining the 
section 382 limitation for the reattributed loss and the loss that is 
not reattributed.
    (v) Special rule for continuity of business requirement. If the 
reattributed net operating loss carryover is a pre-change attribute of 
new loss member and the reattribution occurs within the two year period 
beginning on the change date, then, starting immediately after the 
reattribution, the continuity of business requirement of section 
382(c)(1) is applied with respect to the business enterprise of the 
common parent. Similar principles apply if the reattributed net 
operating loss carryover is a pre-change subgroup attribute and, on the 
day after the reattribution, the common parent is not a member of the 
loss subgroup.
    (5) Election to reattribute section 382 limitation--(i) Effect of 
election. The common parent may elect to apportion to itself all or part 
of any separate section 382 limitation or subgroup section 382 
limitation to which the net operating loss carryover is subject 
immediately before the reattribution. However, no net unrealized built-
in gain of the member (or loss subgroup) whose net operating loss 
carryover is reattributed can be apportioned to the common parent. The 
principles of Sec. 1.1502-95(c) apply to the apportionment, treating, 
as the context requires, references to the former member as references 
to the common parent, and references to the consolidated section 382 
limitation as references to the separate section 382 limitation (or 
subgroup section 382 limitation) that is being apportioned. Thus, for 
example, the common parent can reattribute to itself all or part of the 
value element or adjustment element of the limitation, and any part of 
such element that is apportioned requires a corresponding reduction in 
such element of the separate section 382 limitation of the subsidiary 
whose net operating loss carryover is reattributed (or in the subgroup 
section 382 limitation if the reattributed loss is a pre-change subgroup 
attribute). Appropriate adjustments must be made to the separate section 
382 limitation (or subgroup section 382 limitation) for the consolidated 
return year in which the reattribution is made to reflect that the 
reattributed net operating loss carryover is an attribute acquired by 
the common parent during the year in a transaction to which section 
381(a) applies. The election is made by the common parent as part of the 
election to reattribute the net operating loss carryover. See Sec. 
1.1502-20(g)(4) for the time and manner of making the election.
    (ii) Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of 
this paragraph (d)(5):

    Example 1. Consequence of apportionment. (i) P, the common parent of 
a consolidated group, purchases all of the stock of L on December 31, 
Year 1. L carries over a net operating loss arising in Year 1 to each of 
the next 5 taxable years. The purchase of the L stock causes an 
ownership change of L, and results in a separate section 382 limitation 
of $10 for L's net operating loss carryover based on the value of the L 
stock. On July 2, Year 3, P sells 30 percent of the L stock to A. Under 
Sec. 1.1502-20(g), P elects to apportion to itself $110 of L's $200 net 
operating loss carryover. P also elects to apportion to itself $6 of the 
$10 value element of the separate section 382 limitation.
    (ii) For the consolidated return years ending after December 31, 
Year 3, P's separate section 382 limitation with respect to the 
reattributed net operating loss carryover is $6, adjusted as appropriate 
for any short taxable year, unused section 382 limitation, or other 
adjustment. For the P group's consolidated return year ending December 
31, Year 3, the separate section 382 limitation for L's net operating 
loss carryover is $8, the sum of $5 and $3. Five dollars of the 
limitation is the amount that bears the same relationship to $10 as the 
number of days in the period ending with the deemed section 381(a) 
transaction, 183 days, bears to 365. Three dollars of the limitation is 
the amount that bears the same relationship to $6 as the number of days 
in the period between July 3 and December 31, 182, bears to 365.
    (iii) For L's taxable years ending after December 31, Year 3, L's 
separate section 382 limitation for its $90 of net operating loss 
carryover that was not reattributed to P is $4, adjusted as appropriate 
for any short taxable year, unused section 382 limitation, or other 
adjustment. For L's short taxable year ending December 31, Year 3, the 
section 382 limitation for its $90 of net operating loss carryover is 
$2, the amount that bears the same relationship to $4 (the portion of 
the value element that was not apportioned to P), as the number of days 
during the short

[[Page 541]]

taxable year, 182 days, bears to 365. See Sec. 1.382-5(c).
    Example 2. No apportionment required for consolidated pre-change 
attribute. (i) P, the common parent of a consolidated group, forms L. 
For Year 1, L has an operating loss of $70 that is not absorbed and is 
included in the group's consolidated net operating loss that is carried 
over to subsequent years. On January 1 of Year 3, A buys all of the P 
stock and the P group has an ownership change. The consolidated section 
382 limitation based on the value of the P stock is $10.
    (ii) On April 13 of Year 4, P sells all of the stock of L to B and, 
under Sec. 1.1502-20(g), elects to reattribute to itself $45 of L's net 
operating loss carryover. Following the reattribution, the $45 portion 
of the Year 1 net operating loss carryover retains its character as a 
pre-change consolidated attribute, and remains subject to so much of the 
$10 consolidated section 382 limitation as P does not elect to apportion 
to L under Sec. 1.1502-95(c).

    (e) Time and manner of making election under Sec. 1.1502-91(d)(4)--
(1) In general. This paragraph (e) prescribes the time and manner of 
making the election under Sec. 1.1502-91(d)(4), relating to treating 
two or more corporations as treating the section 1504(a)(1) requirement 
of Sec. 1.1502-91(d)(1)(ii) and (d)(2)(ii) as satisfied.
    (2) Election statement. An election under Sec. 1.1502-91(d)(4) must 
be made by the common parent. The election must be made in the form of 
the following statement: ``THIS IS AN ELECTION UNDER Sec. 1.1502-
91(d)(4) TO TREAT THE FOLLOWING CORPORATIONS AS MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS 
OF Sec. 1.1502-91 (d)(1)(ii) AND (d)(2)(ii) IMMEDIATELY AFTER THEY 
BECAME MEMBERS OF THE GROUP.'' [List separately the name of each 
corporation, its E.I.N., and the date that it became a member of the 
group]. If separate elections are being made for corporations that 
became members at different times or that were acquired from different 
affiliated groups, provide a separate statement and list for each 
election.
    (3) The election statement must be filed by the common parent with 
its income tax return for the consolidated return year in which the 
members with respect to which the election is made become members of the 
group. Such election must be filed on or before the due date for such 
income tax return, including extensions.
    (4) An election made under this paragraph (e) is irrevocable.

Sec. 1.1502-97  Special rules under section 382 for members under 
the jurisdiction of a court in a title 11 or similar case. [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1.1502-98  Coordination with section 383.

    The rules contained in Sec. Sec. 1.1502-91 through 1.1502-96 also 
apply for purposes of section 383, with appropriate adjustments to 
reflect that section 383 applies to credits and net capital losses. For 
example, subgroups with respect to the carryover of general business 
credits, minimum tax credits, unused foreign tax, and net capital loss 
are determined by applying the principles of Sec. 1.1502-91(d)(1). 
Similarly, in the case of net capital losses, general business credits, 
and excess foreign taxes that are pre-change attributes, Sec. 1.383-1 
applies the principles of Sec. Sec. 1.1502-91 through 1.1502-96. For 
example, if a loss group has an ownership change under Sec. 1.1502-92 
and has a carryover of unused general business credits from a pre-change 
consolidated return year to a post-change consolidated return year, the 
amount of the group's regular tax liability for the post-change year 
that can be offset by the carryover cannot exceed the consolidated 
section 383 credit limitation for that post-change year, determined by 
applying the principles of Sec. Sec. 1.383-1(c)(6) and 1.1502-93 
(relating to the computation of the consolidated section 382 
limitation).

<R05>
Sec. 1.1502-99  Effective dates.

    (a) In general. Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this 
section, Sec. Sec. 1.1502-91 through 1.1502-96 and Sec. 1.1502-98 
apply to any testing date on or after June 25, 1999. Sections 1.1502-94 
through 1.1502-96 also apply to a corporation that becomes a member of a 
group or ceases to be a member of a group (or loss subgroup) on any date 
on or after June 25, 1999.

[[Page 542]]

    (b) Special rules--(1) Election to treat subgroup parent requirement 
as satisfied. Section 1.1502-91(d)(4), Sec. 1.1502-91(d)(7), Example 4, 
Sec. 1.1502-92(b)(1)(iii), Sec. 1.1502-92(b)(2), Example 5, the last 
two sentences of Sec. 1.1502-95(b)(3), Sec. 1.1502-95(d)(2)(i), and 
Sec. 1.1502-96(e)(all of which relate to the election under Sec. 
1.1502-91(d)(4) to treat the loss subgroup parent requirement as 
satisfied) apply to corporations that become members of a consolidated 
group in taxable years for which the due date of the income tax return 
(without extensions) is after June 25, 1999.
    (2) Principal purpose of avoiding a limitation. The third sentence 
of Sec. 1.1502-91(d)(5) (relating to members excluded from a loss 
subgroup) applies to corporations that become members of a consolidated 
group on or after June 25, 1999.
    (3) Ceasing to be a member of a loss subgroup--(i) Ownership change 
of a loss subgroup. Section 1.1502-95(d)(2)(ii) and Sec. 1.1502-
95(d)(3), Example 3 apply to corporations that cease to bear a 
relationship described in section 1504(a)(1) to a loss subgroup parent 
in taxable years for which the due date of the income tax return 
(without extensions) is after June 25, 1999.
    (ii) Expiration of 5-year period. Section 1.1502-95(d)(2)(iii) 
applies with respect to the day after the last day of any 5 consecutive 
year period described in that section that ends in a taxable year for 
which the due date of the income tax return (without extensions) is 
after June 25, 1999.
    (4) Reattribution of net operating loss carryovers under Sec. 
1.1502-20(g). Section 1.1502-96(d) applies to reattributions of net 
operating loss carryovers (or capital loss carryovers) in taxable years 
for which the due date of the income tax return (without extensions) is 
after June 25, 1999; except that the election under Sec. 1.1502-
96(d)(5) (relating to an election to reattribute section 382 limitation) 
can be made with any election under Sec. 1.1502-20(g)(4) to reattribute 
to the common parent a net operating loss or net capital loss that is 
timely filed on or after June 25, 1999.
    (5) Election to apportion net unrealized built-in gain. In the case 
of corporations that cease to be members of a loss group (or loss 
subgroup) before June 25, 1999 in a taxable year for which the due date 
of the income tax return (without extensions) is after June 25, 1999, 
Sec. 1.1502-95(a), (b), (c), and (f) apply to those corporations if the 
common parent makes the election described in the second sentence of 
paragraph (c)(1) of Sec. 1.1502-95 in the time and manner prescribed in 
paragraph (f) of Sec. 1.1502-95.
    (c) Testing period may include a period beginning before June 25, 
1999--
    (1) In general. A testing period for purposes of Sec. Sec. 1.1502-
91 through 1.1502-96 and 1.1502-98 may include a period beginning before 
June 25, 1999. Thus, for example, in applying Sec. 1.1502-
92(b)(1)(i)(relating to the determination of an ownership change of a 
loss group), the determination of the lowest percentage of ownership 
interest of any 5-percent shareholder of the common parent during a 
testing period ending on a testing date occurring on or after June 25, 
1999 takes into account the period beginning before June 25, 1999, 
except to the extent that the period is more than 3 years before the 
testing date or is otherwise before the beginning of the testing period. 
See Sec. 1.1502-92(b)(1).
    (2) Transition rule for net unrealized built-in loss. A loss group 
(or loss subgroup) that has a net unrealized built-in loss on a testing 
date on or after June 25, 1999 may apply Sec. 1.1502-91A(g) (and Sec. 
1.1502-96A(a) as it relates to Sec. 1.1502-91A(g)) for the period 
ending on the day before June 25, 1999 to determine under Sec. 1.382-
2T(d)(ii)(A) the earliest date that its testing period begins (treating 
the day before June 25, 1999 as the end of a taxable year.) Thus, for 
example, if a consolidated group with no net operating losses has a net 
unrealized built-in loss determined under Sec. 1.1502-91(g) on a 
testing date after June 25, 1999, but, under Sec. 1.1502-91A(g), does 
not have a net unrealized built-in loss for the period ending on the day 
before June 25, 1999, the group's testing period begins no earlier than 
June 25, 1999.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1502-100  Corporations exempt from tax.

    (a) In general--(1) Computation of tax liability. The tax liability 
for a consolidated return year of a group of two or

[[Page 543]]

more corporations described in section 1504(e) which are exempt from 
taxation under section 501 (hereinafter referred to in this section as 
``exempt group'') shall be determined on a consolidated basis by 
applying the provisions of subchapter F of chapter 1 of the code in the 
manner provided in this section. See section 1504(e) for tax-exempt 
corporations eligible to file a consolidated return.
    (2) Applicability of other consolidated return provisions. The 
provisions of Sec. 1.1502-1 through Sec. 1.1502-80 shall be applicable 
to an exempt group to the extent they are not inconsistent with the 
provisions of this section or the provisions of subchapter F of chapter 
1 of the Code. For purposes of applying the provisions of Sec. 1.1502-1 
through Sec. 1.1502-80 to an exempt group, the following substitutions 
shall be made:
    (i) The term ``exempt group'' shall be substituted for the term 
``group'',
    (ii) The terms ``unrelated business taxable income'', ``separate 
unrelated business taxable income'', and ``consolidated unrelated 
business taxable income'' shall be substituted for the terms ``taxable 
income'', ``separate taxable income'', and ``consolidated taxable 
income'', and
    (iii) The term ``consolidated liability for tax determined under 
Sec. 1.1502-2'' (or an equivalent term) shall mean the consolidated 
liability for tax of an exempt group determined under paragraph (b) of 
this section.
    (b) Consolidated liability for tax. The tax liability for a 
consolidated return year of an exempt group is the tax imposed by 
section 511(a) or section 1201(a) on the consolidated unrelated business 
taxable income for the year (determined under paragraph (c) of this 
section), and by allowing the credits and surtax exemption provided in 
Sec. 1.1502-2.
    (c) Consolidated unrelated business taxable income. The consolidated 
unrelated business taxable income for a consolidated return year shall 
be determined by taking into account:
    (1) The separate unrelated business taxable income of each member of 
the exempt group (determined under paragraph (d) of this section);
    (2) Any consolidated net operating loss deduction (determined under 
Sec. 1.1502-21A or 1.1502-21 (as appropriate) subject to the 
limitations provided in section 512(b)(6);
    (3) Any consolidated charitable contribution deduction (determined 
under Sec. 1.1502-24) subject to the limitations provided in section 
512(b)(10); and
    (4) Any consolidated net gain or net loss from the disposition of 
debt-financed property (as defined in section 514(b)) taken into account 
as provided by section 514(a), or from the cutting of timber to which 
section 631 applies.
    (d) Separate unrelated business taxable income. The separate 
unrelated business taxable income of a member of an exempt group shall 
be computed in accordance with the provisions of section 512 covering 
the determination of unrelated business taxable income of separate 
corporations, except that:
    (1) The provisions of paragraphs (a) through (k) and (o) of Sec. 
1.1502-12 shall apply; and
    (2) No charitable contributions deduction shall be taken into 
account under section 512(b)(10).

See sections 511(c) and 512(a)(3)(C) for special rules applicable to 
organizations described in section 501(c)(2).

<R05>
Sec. 1.1503-2  Dual consolidated loss.

    (a) Purpose and scope. This section provides rules for the 
application of section 1503(d), concerning the determination and use of 
dual consolidated losses. Paragraph (b) of this section provides a 
general rule prohibiting a dual consolidated loss from offsetting the 
taxable income of a domestic affiliate. Paragraph (c) of this section 
provides definitions of the terms used in this section. Paragraph (d) of 
this section provides rules for calculating the amount of a dual 
consolidated loss and for adjusting the basis of stock of a dual 
resident corporation. Paragraph (e) of this section contains an anti-
avoidance provision. Paragraph (f) of this section applies the rules of 
paragraph (d) of this section to the computation of foreign tax credit 
limitations. Paragraph (g) of this section provides certain exceptions 
to the limitation rule of paragraph (b) of this section. Finally, 
paragraph (h) of this section provides the effective date of the 
regulations and a provision for the retroactive application of the 
regulations to qualifying taxpayers.
    (b) In general--(1) Limitation on the use of a dual consolidated 
loss to offset income of a domestic affiliate. Except as otherwise 
provided in this section, a dual consolidated loss of a dual resident 
corporation cannot offset the taxable income of any domestic affiliate 
in the taxable year in which the loss is recognized or in any other 
taxable year, regardless of whether the loss offsets income of another 
person under the income tax laws of a foreign country and regardless of 
whether the income that the loss may offset in the foreign country is, 
has been, or will be subject to tax in the United States. Pursuant to 
paragraph (c) (1) and (2) of this section, the same limitation shall 
apply to a dual consolidated loss of a separate unit of a domestic 
corporation as if the separate unit were a wholly owned subsidiary of 
such corporation.
    (2) Limitation on the use of a dual consolidated loss to offset 
income of a successor-in-interest. A dual consolidated loss of a dual 
resident corporation also cannot be used to offset the taxable income of 
another corporation by means of a transaction in which the other 
corporation succeeds to the tax attributes of the dual resident 
corporation under section 381 of the Code. Similarly, a dual 
consolidated loss of a separate unit of a domestic corporation cannot be 
used to offset income of the domestic corporation following the 
termination, liquidation, sale, or other disposition of the separate 
unit. However, if a dual resident corporation transfers its assets to 
another corporation in a transaction subject to section 381, and the 
acquiring corporation is a dual resident corporation of the same foreign 
country of which the transferor dual resident corporation is a resident, 
or a domestic corporation that carries on the business activities of the 
transferor dual resident corporation as a separate unit, then income 
generated by the transferee dual resident corporation, or separate unit, 
may be offset by the carryover losses of the transferor dual resident 
corporation. In addition, if a domestic corporation transfers a separate 
unit to another domestic corporation in a transaction subject to section 
381, the income generated by the separate unit following the transfer 
may be offset by the carryover losses of the separate unit.
    (3) Application of rules to multiple tiers of separate units. If a 
separate unit of a domestic corporation is owned indirectly through 
another separate unit, the principles of paragraph (b) (1) and (2) of 
this section shall apply as if the upper-tier separate unit were a 
subsidiary of the domestic corporation and the lower-tier separate unit 
were a lower-tier subsidiary.
    (4) Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of 
this paragraph (b).

    Example 1. P, a domestic corporation, owns all of the outstanding 
stock of DRC, a domestic corporation. P and DRC file a consolidated U.S. 
income tax return. DRC is managed and controlled in Country W, a country 
that determines the tax residence of corporations according to their 
place of management and control. Therefore, DRC is a dual resident 
corporation and any net operating loss it incurs is a dual consolidated 
loss. In Years 1 through 3, DRC incurs dual consolidated losses. Under 
this paragraph (b), the dual consolidated losses may not be used to 
offset P's income on the group's consolidated U.S. income tax return. At 
the end of Year 3, DRC sells all of its assets and discontinues its 
business operations. DRC is then liquidated into P, pursuant to the 
provisions of

[[Page 545]]

section 332. Normally, under section 381, P would succeed to, and be 
permitted to utilize, DRC's net operating loss carryovers. However, this 
paragraph (b) prohibits the dual consolidated losses of DRC from 
reducing P's income for U.S. tax purposes. Therefore, DRC's net 
operating loss carryovers will not be available to offset P's income.
    Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that DRC 
does not sell its assets and, following the liquidation of DRC, P 
continues to operate DRC's business as a separate unit (e.g., a branch). 
DRC's loss carryovers are available to offset P's income generated by 
the assets previously owned by DRC and now held by the separate unit.

    (c) Definitions. The following definitions shall apply for purposes 
of this section.
    (1) Domestic corporation. The term ``domestic corporation'' has the 
meaning assigned to it by section 7701(a) (3) and (4). The term also 
includes any corporation otherwise treated as a domestic corporation by 
the Code, including, but not limited to, sections 269B, 953(d), and 1504 
(d). For purposes of this section, any separate unit of a domestic 
corporation, as defined in paragraph (c) (3) and (4) of this section, 
shall be treated as a separate domestic corporation.
    (2) Dual resident corporation. A dual resident corporation is a 
domestic corporation that is subject to the income tax of a foreign 
country on its worldwide income or on a residence basis. A corporation 
is taxed on a residence basis if it is taxed as a resident under the 
laws of the foreign country. An S corporation, as defined in section 
1361, is not a dual resident corporation. For purposes of this section, 
any separate unit of a domestic corporation, as defined in paragraph (c) 
(3) and (4) of this section, shall be treated as a dual resident 
corporation. Unless otherwise indicated, any reference in this section 
to a dual resident corporation refers also to a separate unit.
    (3) Separate unit--(i) The term ``separate unit'' shall mean any of 
the following:
    (A) A foreign branch, as defined in Sec. 1.367(a)-6T(g) (or a 
successor regulation), that is owned either directly by a domestic 
corporation or indirectly by a domestic corporation through ownership of 
a partnership or trust interest (regardless of whether the partnership 
or trust is a United States person);
    (B) an interest in a partnership; or
    (C) an interest in a trust.
    (ii) If two or more foreign branches located in the same foreign 
country are owned by a single domestic corporation and the losses of 
each branch are made available to offset the income of the other 
branches under the tax laws of the foreign country, within the meaning 
of paragraph (c)(15)(ii) of this section, then the branches shall be 
treated as one separate unit.
    (4) Hybrid entity separate unit. The term ``separate unit'' includes 
an interest in an entity that is not taxable as an association for U.S. 
income tax purposes but is subject to income tax in a foreign country as 
a corporation (or otherwise at the entity level) either on its worldwide 
income or on a residence basis.
    (5) Dual consolidated loss--(i) In general. The term ``dual 
consolidated loss'' means the net operating loss (as defined in section 
172(c) and the regulations thereunder) of a domestic corporation 
incurred in a year in which the corporation is dual resident 
corporation. The dual consolidated loss shall be computed under 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section. The fact that a particular item taken 
into account in computing a dual resident corporation's net operating 
loss is not taken into account in computing income subject to a foreign 
country's income tax shall not cause such item to be excluded from the 
calculation of the dual consolidated loss.
    (ii) Exceptions. A dual consolidated loss shall not include the 
following--
    (A) A net operating loss incurred by a dual resident corporation in 
a foreign country whose income tax laws--
    (1) Do not permit the dual resident corporation to use its losses, 
expenses or deductions to offset the income of any other person that is 
recognized in the same taxable year in which the losses, expenses or 
deductions are incurred; and
    (2) Do not permit the losses, expenses or deductions of the dual 
resident corporation to be carried over or back to be used, by any 
means, to offset the income of any other person in other taxable years; 
or
    (B) A net operating loss incurred during that portion of the taxable 
year

[[Page 546]]

prior to the date on which the domestic corporation becomes a dual 
resident corporation or subsequent to the date on which the domestic 
corporation ceases to be a dual resident corporation. For purposes of 
determining the amount of the net operating loss incurred in that 
portion of the taxable year prior to the date on which the domestic 
corporation becomes a dual resident corporation or subsequent to the 
date on which the domestic corporation ceases to be a dual resident 
corporation, in no event shall more than the aggregate of the equal 
daily portion of the net operating loss commensurate with the portion of 
the taxable year during which the domestic corporation was not a dual 
resident corporation be allocated to that portion of the taxable year in 
which the domestic corporation was not a dual resident corporation.
    (iii) Dual consolidated losses of separate units that are 
partnership interests, including interests in hybrid entities. 
[Reserved]
    (6) Subject to tax. For purposes of determining whether a domestic 
corporation is subject to the income tax of a foreign country on its 
income, the fact that the corporation has no actual income tax liability 
to the foreign country for a particular taxable year shall not be taken 
into account.
    (7) Foreign country. For purposes of this section, possessions of 
the United States shall be considered foreign countries.
    (8) Consolidated group. The term ``consolidated group'' means an 
affiliated group, as defined in section 1504(a), with which a dual 
resident corporation or domestic owner files a consolidated U.S. income 
tax return.
    (9) Domestic owner. The term ``domestic owner'' means a domestic 
corporation that owns one or more separate units.
    (10) Affiliated dual resident corporation or affiliated domestic 
owner. The term ``affiliated dual resident corporation'' or ``affiliated 
domestic owner'' means a dual resident corporation or domestic owner 
that is a member of a consolidated group.
    (11) Unaffiliated dual resident corporation or unaffiliated domestic 
owner. The term ``unaffiliated dual resident corporation'' or 
``unaffiliated domestic owner'' means a dual resident corporation or 
domestic owner that is an unaffiliated domestic corporation.
    (12) Successor-in-interest. The term ``successor-in-interest'' means 
an acquiring corporation that succeeds to the tax attributes of an 
acquired corporation by means of a transaction subject to section 381.
    (13) Domestic affiliate. The term ``domestic affiliate'' means any 
member of an affiliated group, without regard to the exceptions 
contained in section 1504(b) (other than section 1504(b)(3)) relating to 
includible corporations.
    (14) Unaffiliated domestic corporation. The term ``unaffiliated 
domestic corporation'' means a domestic corporation that is not a member 
of an affiliated group.
    (15) Use of loss to offset income of a domestic affiliate or another 
person--(i) A dual consolidated loss shall be deemed to offset income of 
a domestic affiliate in the year it is included in the computation of 
the consolidated taxable income of a consolidated group. The fact that 
no tax benefit results from the inclusion of the dual consolidated loss 
in the computation of the group's consolidated taxable income in the 
taxable year shall not be taken into account.
    (ii) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(15)(iii) of this section, a 
loss, expense, or deduction taken into account in computing a dual 
consolidated loss shall be deemed to offset income of another person 
under the income tax laws of a foreign country in the year it is made 
available for such offset. The fact that the other person does not have 
sufficient income in that year to benefit from such an offset shall not 
be taken into account. However, where the laws of a foreign country 
provide an election that would enable a dual resident corporation or 
separate unit to use its losses, expenses, or deductions to offset 
income of another person, the losses, expenses, or deductions shall be 
considered to offset such income only if the election is made.
    (iii) The losses, expenses, or deductions taken into account in 
computing a dual resident corporation's or separate unit's dual 
consolidated loss shall not be deemed to offset income of another person 
under the income tax laws

[[Page 547]]

of a foreign country for purposes of this section, if under the laws of 
the foreign country the losses, expenses, or deductions of the dual 
resident corporation or separate unit are used to offset the income of 
another dual resident corporation or separate unit within the same 
consolidated group (or income of another separate unit that is owned by 
the unaffiliated domestic owner of the first separate unit). If the 
losses, expenses, or deductions of a dual resident corporation or 
separate unit are made available under the laws of a foreign country to 
offset the income of other dual resident corporations or separate units 
within the same consolidated group (or other separate units owned by the 
unaffiliated domestic owner of the first separate unit), as well as the 
income of another person, and the laws of the foreign country do not 
provide applicable rules for determining which person's income is offset 
by the losses, expenses, or deductions, then for purposes of this 
section, the losses, expenses or deductions shall be deemed to offset 
the income of the other dual resident corporations or separate units, to 
the extent of such income, before being considered to offset the income 
of the other person.
    (iv) Except to the extent paragraph (g)(1) of this section applies, 
where the income tax laws of a foreign country deny the use of losses, 
expenses, or deductions of a dual resident corporation to offset the 
income of another person because the dual resident corporation is also 
subject to income taxation by another country on its worldwide income or 
on a residence basis, the dual resident corporation shall be treated as 
if it actually had offset its dual consolidated loss against the income 
of another person in such foreign country.
    (16) Examples. The following examples illustrate this paragraph (c).

    Example 1. X, a member of a consolidated group, conducts business 
through a branch in Country Y. Under Country Y's income tax laws, the 
branch is taxed as a permanent establishment and its losses may be used 
under the Country Y form of consolidation to offset the income of Z, a 
Country Y affiliate of X. In Year 1, the branch of X incurs an overall 
loss that would be treated as a net operating loss if the branch were a 
separate domestic corporation. Under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, 
the branch of X is treated as a separate domestic corporation and a dual 
resident corporation. Thus, under paragraph (c)(5), its loss constitutes 
a dual consolidated loss. Unless X qualifies for an exception under 
paragraph (g) of this section, paragraph (b) of this section precludes 
the use of the branch's loss to offset any income of X not derived from 
the branch operations or any income of a domestic affiliate of X.
    Example 2. A and B are members of a consolidated group. FC is a 
Country X corporation that is wholly owned by B. A and B organize a 
partnership, P, under the laws of Country X. P conducts business in 
Country X and its business activity constitutes a foreign branch within 
the meaning of paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) of this section. P also earns U.S. 
source income that is unconnected with the branch operations and, 
therefore, is not subject to tax by Country X. Under the laws of Country 
X, the branch can consolidate with FC. The interests in P held by A and 
B are each treated as a dual resident corporation. The branch is also 
treated as a separate dual resident corporation. Unless an exception 
under paragraph (g) of this section applies, any dual consolidated loss 
incurred by P's branch cannot offset the U.S. source income earned by P 
or any other income of A or B.
    Example 3. X is classified as a partnership for U.S. income tax 
purposes. A, B, and C are the sole partners of X. A and B are domestic 
corporations and C is a Country Y corporation. For U.S. income tax 
purposes, each partner has an equal interest in each item of partnership 
profit or loss. Under Country Y's law, X is classified as a corporation 
and its income and losses may be used under the Country Y form of 
consolidation to offset the income of companies that are affiliates of 
X. Under paragraph (c)(3) and (4) of this section, the partnership 
interests held by A and B are treated as separate domestic corporations 
and as dual resident corporations. Unless an exception under paragraph 
(g) of this section applies, losses allocated to A and B can only be 
used to offset profits of X allocated to A and B, respectively.
    Example 4. P, a domestic corporation, files a consolidated U.S. 
income tax return with its two wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries, DRC1 
and DRC2. Each subsidiary is also treated as a Country Y resident for 
Country Y tax purposes. Thus, DRC1 and DRC2 are dual resident 
corporations. DRC1 owns FC, a Country Y corporation. Country Y's tax 
laws permit affiliated resident corporations to file a form of 
consolidated return. In Year 1, DRC1 incurs a $200 net operating loss 
for both U.S. and Country Y tax purposes, while DRC2 recognizes $200 of 
income under the tax laws of each country. FC also earns $200 of income 
for Country Y tax purposes. DRC1, DRC2, and FC file a Country Y 
consolidated return. However, Country Y has no applicable rules for 
determining which income is offset by DRC1's $200 loss. Under paragraph

[[Page 548]]

(c)(15)(iii) of this section, the loss shall be treated as offsetting 
DRC2's $200 of income. Because DRC1 and DRC2 are members of the same 
consolidated group, for purposes of this section, the offset of DRC1's 
loss against the income of DRC2 is not considered a use of the loss 
against the income of another person under the laws of a foreign 
country.
    Example 5. DRC, a domestic corporation, files a consolidated U.S. 
income tax return with its parent, P. DRC is also subject to tax in 
Country Y on its worldwide income. Therefore, DRC is a dual resident 
corporation and any net operating loss incurred by DRC is a dual 
consolidated loss. Country Y's tax laws permit corporations that are 
subject to tax on their worldwide income to use the Country Y form of 
consolidation, thus enabling eligible corporations to use their losses 
to offset income of affiliates. However, to prevent corporations like 
DRC from offsetting losses against income of affiliates in Country Y and 
then again offsetting the losses against income of foreign affiliates 
under the tax laws of another country, Country Y prevents a corporation 
that is also subject to the income tax of another country on its 
worldwide income or on a residence basis from using the Country Y form 
of consolidation. There is no agreement, as described in paragraph 
(g)(1) of this section, between the United States and Country Y. Because 
of Country Y's statute, DRC will be treated as having actually offset 
its losses against the income of affiliates in Country Y under paragraph 
(c)(15)(iv) of this section. Therefore, DRC will not be able to file an 
agreement described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section and offset its 
losses against the income of P or any other domestic affiliate.

    (d) Special rules for accounting for dual consolidated losses--(1) 
Determination of amount of dual consolidated loss--(i) Dual resident 
corporation that is a member of a consolidated group. For purposes of 
determining whether a dual resident corporation that is a member of a 
consolidated group has a dual consolidated loss for the taxable year, 
the dual resident corporation shall compute its taxable income (or loss) 
in accordance with the rules set forth in the regulations under section 
1502 governing the computation of consolidated taxable income, taking 
into account only the dual resident corporation's items of income, gain, 
deduction, and loss for the year. However, for purposes of this 
computation, the following items shall not be taken into account:
    (A) Any net capital loss of the dual resident corporation; and
    (B) Any carryover or carryback losses.
    (ii) Dual resident corporation that is a separate unit of a domestic 
corporation. For purposes of determining whether a separate unit has a 
dual consolidated loss for the taxable year, the separate unit shall 
compute its taxable income (or loss) as if it were a separate domestic 
corporation and a dual resident corporation in accordance with the 
provisions of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, using only those 
items of income, expense, deduction, and loss that are otherwise 
attributable to such separate unit.
    (2) Effect of a dual consolidated loss. For any taxable year in 
which a dual resident corporation or separate unit has a dual 
consolidated loss to which paragraph (b) of this section applies, the 
following rules shall apply.
    (i) If the dual resident corporation is a member of a consolidated 
group, the group shall compute its consolidated taxable income without 
taking into account the items of income, loss, or deduction taken into 
account in computing the dual consolidated loss. The dual consolidated 
loss may be carried over or back for use in other taxable years as a 
separate net operating loss carryover or carryback of the dual resident 
corporation arising in the year incurred. It shall be treated as a loss 
incurred by the dual resident corporation in a separate return 
limitation year and (without regard to whether the dual resident 
corporation is a common parent) shall be subject to all of the 
limitations of Sec. Sec. 1.1502-21A(c) or 1.1502-21(c), as appropriate 
(relating to limitations on net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks 
from separate return limitation years).
    (ii) The unaffiliated domestic owner of a separate unit, or the 
consolidated group of an affiliated domestic owner, shall compute its 
taxable income without taking into account the items of income, loss or 
deduction taken into account in computing the separate unit's dual 
consolidated loss. The dual consolidated loss shall be treated as a loss 
incurred by a separate corporation and its use shall be subject to all 
of the limitations of Sec. Sec. 1.1502-21A(c) or 1.1502-21(c), as 
appropriate, as if the separate unit were filing a consolidated return

[[Page 549]]

with the unaffiliated domestic owner or with the consolidated group of 
the affiliated domestic owner.
    (3) Basis adjustments for dual consolidated losses--(i) Dual 
resident corporation that is a member of an affiliated group. When a 
dual resident corporation is a member of a consolidated group, each 
other member owning stock in the dual resident corporation shall adjust 
the basis of the stock in the following manner.
    (A) Positive adjustments. Positive adjustments shall be made in 
accordance with the principles of Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(1), except that 
there shall be no positive adjustment under Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(1)(ii) 
for any amount of the dual consolidated loss that is not absorbed as a 
result of the application of paragraph (b) of this section. In addition, 
there shall be no positive adjustment for any amount included in income 
pursuant to paragraph (g)(2)(vii) of this section.
    (B) Negative adjustments. Negative adjustments shall be made in 
accordance with the principles of Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(2), except that 
there shall be no negative adjustment under Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(2)(ii) 
for the amount of the dual consolidated loss subject to paragraph (b) of 
this section that is absorbed in a carryover year.
    (ii) Dual resident corporation that is a separate unit arising from 
an interest in a partnership. Where a separate unit is an interest in a 
partnership, the domestic owner shall adjust its basis in the separate 
unit in accordance with section 705, except that no increase in basis 
shall be permitted for any amount included as income pursuant to 
paragraph (g)(2)(vii) of this section.
    (4) Examples. The following examples illustrate this paragraph (d).

    Example 1. (i) P, S1, S2, and T are domestic corporations. P owns 
all of the stock of S1 and S2. S2 owns all of the stock of T. T is a 
resident of Country FC for Country FC income tax purposes. Therefore, T 
is a dual resident corporation. P, S1, S2, and T file a consolidated 
U.S. income tax return. X and Y are corporations that are not members of 
the consolidated group.
    (ii) At the beginning of Year 1, P has a basis of $1000 in the stock 
of S2. S2 has a $500 basis in the stock of T.
    (iii) In Year 1, T incurs interest expense in the amount of $100. In 
addition, T sells a noncapital asset, u, in which it has a basis of $10, 
to S1 for $50. T also sells a noncapital asset, v, in which it has a 
basis of $200, to S1 for $100. The sales of u and v are intercompany 
transactions described in Sec. 1.1502-13. T also sells a capital asset, 
z, in which it has a basis of $180, to Y for $90. In Year 1, S1 earns 
$200 of separate taxable income, calculated in accordance with Sec. 
1.1502-12, as well as $90 of capital gain from a sale of an asset to X. 
P and S2 have no items of income, loss, or deduction for Year 1.
    (iv) In Year 1, T has a dual consolidated loss of $100 (attributable 
to its interest expense). T's $90 capital loss is not included in the 
computation of the dual consolidated loss. Instead, T's capital loss is 
included in the computation of the consolidated group's capital gain net 
income under Sec. 1.1502-22(c) and is used to offset S1's $90 capital 
gain.
    (v) No elective agreement, as described in paragraph (g)(1) of this 
section, exists between the United States and Country FC. For Country FC 
tax purposes, T's $100 loss is offset against the income of a Country FC 
affiliate. Therefore, T is not eligible for the exception provided in 
paragraph (g)(2) of this section.
    (vi) Because T has a dual consolidated loss for the year, the 
consolidated taxable income of the consolidated group is calculated 
without regard to T's items of income, loss or deduction taken into 
account in computing the dual consolidated loss. Therefore, the 
consolidated taxable income of the consolidated group is $200 (the sum 
of $200 of separate taxable income earned by S1 plus $90 of capital gain 
earned by S1 minus $90 of capital loss incurred by T). The $40 gain 
recognized by T upon the sale of item u to S1 and the $100 loss 
recognized by T upon the sale of item v to S1 are deferred pursuant to 
Sec. 1.1502-13(c)(1).
    (vii) S2 may not make the positive adjustment provided for in Sec. 
1.1502-32(b)(1)(ii) to its basis in the stock of T for the $100 dual 
consolidated loss incurred by T. In addition, no positive adjustment in 
the basis of the stock is required for T's $90 capital loss because the 
loss has been absorbed by the consolidated group. S2, however, must make 
the negative adjustment provided for in Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(2)(i) for its 
allocable part of T's deficit in earnings and profits for the taxable 
year attributable to both T's $100 dual consolidated loss and T's $90 
capital loss. Thus, as provided in Sec. 1.1502-32(e)(1), S2 must make a 
$190 net negative adjustment to its basis in the stock of T, reducing 
its basis to $310. As provided in Sec. 1.1502-33(c)(4)(ii)(a), S2's 
earnings and profits for Year 1 will reflect S2's decrease in its basis 
in T stock for the taxable year. Since S2 has no other earnings and 
profits for the taxable year, S2 has a $190 deficit in earnings and 
profits for the year. As provided in Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(2)(i), P must 
make a negative adjustment to its basis in the stock of S2 for its 
allocable part of S2's deficit in

[[Page 550]]

earnings and profits for the taxable year. Thus, P must make a $190 net 
negative adjustment to its basis in S2 stock, reducing its basis to 
$810.
    Example 2. (i) The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that 
in Year 2, S1 sells items u and v to X for no gain or loss. The 
disposition of items u and v outside of the consolidated group restores 
the deferred loss and gain to T. T also incurs $100 of interest expense 
in Year 2. In addition, T sells a noncapital asset, r, in which it has a 
basis of $100, to Y for $300. P and S2 have no items of income, loss, or 
deduction for Year 2.
    (ii) T has $40 of separate taxable income in Year 2, computed as 
follows:

 ($100)  interest expense
 ($100)  sale of item v to S1
   $ 40  sale of item u to S1
   $200  sale of item r to Y
--------
   $ 40
 

    Thus, T has no dual consolidated loss for the year.
    (iii) Since T does not have a dual consolidated loss for the taxable 
year, the group's consolidated taxable income is calculated in 
accordance with the general rule of Sec. 1.1502-11 and not in 
accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section. T is the only member 
of the consolidated group that has any income or loss for the taxable 
year. Thus, the consolidated taxable income of the group, computed 
without regard to T's dual consolidated loss carryover, is $40.
    (iv) As provided by Sec. 1.1502-21A(c), the amount of the dual 
consolidated loss arising in Year 1 that is included in the group's 
consolidated net operating loss deduction for Year 2 is $40 (that is, 
the consolidated taxable income computed without regard to the 
consolidated net operating loss deduction minus such consolidated 
taxable income recomputed by excluding the items of income and deduction 
of T). Thus, the group has no consolidated taxable income for the year.
    (v) S2 must make the positive adjustment provided for in Sec. 
1.502-32(b)(1)(i) to its basis in T stock for its allocable part of T's 
undistributed earnings and profits for the taxable year. S2 cannot make 
the negative adjustment provided for in Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(2)(ii) for 
the dual consolidated loss of T incurred in Year 1 and absorbed in Year 
2. Thus, as provided in Sec. 1.1502-32(e)(2), S2 must make a $40 net 
positive adjustment to its basis in T stock, increasing its basis to 
$350. As provided in Sec. 1.1502-33(c)(4)(ii)(a), S2's earnings and 
profits for Year 2 will reflect S2's increase in its basis in T stock 
for the taxable year. Since S2 has no other earnings and profits for the 
taxable year, S2 has $40 of earnings and profits for the year. As 
provided in Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(1)(i), P must make a positive adjustment 
to its basis in the stock of S2 for its allocable part of the 
undistributed earnings and profits of S2 for the taxable year. Thus, P 
must make a $40 net positive adjustment to its basis in S2 stock, 
increasing its basis to $850.

    (e) Special rule for use of dual consolidated loss to offset tainted 
income--(1) In general. The dual consolidated loss of any dual resident 
corporation that ceases to be a dual resident corporation shall not be 
used to offset income of such corporation to the extent that such income 
is tainted income, as defined in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
    (2) Tainted income defined. Tainted income is any income derived 
from tainted assets, as defined in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, 
beginning on the date such assets are acquired by the dual resident 
corporation. In the absence of evidence establishing the actual amount 
of income that is attributable to the tainted assets, the portion of a 
corporation's income in a particular taxable year that is treated as 
tainted income shall be an amount equal to the corporation's taxable 
income for the year multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is 
the fair market value of the tainted asset at the end of the taxable 
year and the denominator of which is the fair market value of the total 
assets owned by the corporation at the end of the taxable year. 
Documentation submitted to establish the actual amount of income that is 
attributable to the tainted assets must be attached to the consolidated 
group's or unaffiliated dual resident corporation's timely filed tax 
return for the taxable year in which the income is recognized.
    (3) Tainted assets defined. Tainted assets are any asset acquired by 
a dual resident corporation in a non-recognition transaction, as defined 
in section 7701(a)(45), or any assets otherwise transferred to the 
corporation as a contribution to capital, at any time during the three 
taxable years immediately preceding the taxable year in which the 
corporation ceases to be a dual resident corporation or at any time 
thereafter. Tainted assets shall not include assets that were acquired 
by such dual resident corporation on or before December 31, 1986.
    (4) Exceptions. Income derived from assets acquired by a dual 
resident corporation shall not be subject to the

[[Page 551]]

limitation described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, if--
    (i) For the taxable year in which the assets were acquired, the 
corporation did not have a dual consolidated loss (or a carry forward of 
a dual consolidated loss to such year); or
    (ii) The assets were acquired as replacement property in the 
ordinary course of business.
    (f) Computation of foreign tax credit limitations. If a dual 
resident corporation or separate unit is subject to paragraph (d)(2) of 
this section, the consolidated group or unaffiliated domestic owner 
shall compute its foreign tax credit limitation by applying the 
limitations of paragraph (d)(2). Thus, the dual consolidated loss is not 
taken into account until the year in which it is absorbed.
    (g) Exception--(1) Elective agreement in place between the United 
States and a foreign country. Paragraph (b) of this section shall not 
apply to a dual consolidated loss to the extent the dual resident 
corporation, or domestic owner of a separate unit, elects to deduct the 
loss in the United States pursuant to an agreement entered into between 
the United States and a foreign country that puts into place an elective 
procedure through which losses offset income in only one country.
    (2) Elective relief provision--(i) [Reserved]. For further guidance, 
see Sec. 1.1503-2T(g)(2)(i).
    (ii) Consistency rule--(A) If any loss, expense, or deduction taken 
into account in computing the dual consolidated loss of a dual resident 
corporation or separate unit is used under the laws of a foreign country 
to offset the income of another person, then the following other dual 
consolidated losses (if any) shall be treated as also having been used 
to offset income of another person under the laws of such foreign 
country, but only if the income tax laws of the foreign country permit 
any loss, expense, or deduction taken into account in computing the 
other dual consolidated loss to be used to offset the income of another 
person in the same taxable year;
    (1) Any dual consolidated loss of a dual resident corporation that 
is a member of the same consolidated group of which the first dual 
resident corporation or domestic owner is a member, if any loss, 
expense, or deduction taken into account in computing such dual 
consolidated loss is recognized under the income tax laws of such 
country in the same taxable year; and
    (2) Any dual consolidated loss of a separate unit that is owned by 
the same domestic owner that owns the first separate unit, or that is 
owned by any member of the same consolidated group of which the first 
dual resident corporation or domestic owner is a member, if any loss, 
expense, or deduction taken into account in computing such dual 
consolidated loss is recognized under the income tax laws of such 
country in the same taxable year.
    (B) The following examples illustrate the application of this 
paragraph (g)(2)(ii).

    Example 1. P, a domestic corporation, owns A and B, which are 
domestic corporations, and C, a Country X corporation. A is subject to 
the income tax laws of Country X on a residence basis and, thus, is a 
dual resident corporation. B conducts business in Country X through a 
branch, which is a separate unit under paragraph (c)(3) of this section. 
The income tax laws of Country X permit branches of foreign corporations 
to elect to file consolidated returns with Country X affiliates. In Year 
1, A incurs a dual consolidated loss, which is used to offset the income 
of C under the Country X form of consolidation. The branch of B also 
incurs a net operating loss. However, B elects not to use the loss on a 
Country X consolidated return to offset the income of foreign 
affiliates. The use of A's loss to offset the income of C in Country X 
will cause the separate unit of B to be treated as if it too had used 
its dual consolidated loss to offset the income of an affiliate in 
Country X. Therefore, an election and agreement under this paragraph 
(g)(2) cannot be made with respect to the separate unit's dual 
consolidated loss.
    Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that the 
income tax laws of Country X do not permit branches of foreign 
corporations to file consolidated income tax returns with Country X 
affiliates. Therefore, an election and agreement described in this 
paragraph (g)(2) may be made for the dual consolidated loss incurred by 
the separate unit of B.

    (iii) Triggering events requiring the recapture of dual consolidated 
losses--(A) The consolidated group, unaffiliated dual resident 
corporation, or unaffiliated domestic owner must agree that,

[[Page 552]]

if there is a triggering event described in this paragraph (g)(2)(iii), 
and no exception applies under paragraph (g)(2)(iv) of this section, the 
consolidated group, unaffiliated dual resident corporation, or 
unaffiliated domestic owner will recapture and report as income the 
amount of the dual consolidated loss provided in paragraph (g)(2)(vii) 
of this section on its tax return for the taxable year in which the 
triggering event occurs (or, when the triggering event is a use of the 
loss for foreign purposes, the taxable year that includes the last day 
of the foreign tax year during which such use occurs). In addition, the 
consolidated group, unaffiliated dual resident corporation, or 
unaffiliated domestic owner must pay any applicable interest charge 
required by paragraph (g)(2)(vii) of this section. For purposes of this 
section, any of the following events shall constitute a triggering 
event:
    (1) In any taxable year up to and including the 15th taxable year 
following the year in which the dual consolidated loss that is the 
subject of the agreement filed under this paragraph (g)(2) was incurred, 
any portion of the losses, expenses, or deductions taken into account in 
computing the dual consolidated loss is used by any means to offset the 
income of any other person under the income tax laws of a foreign 
country;
    (2) An affiliated dual resident corporation or affiliated domestic 
owner ceases to be a member of the consolidated group that filed the 
election. For purposes of this paragraph (g)(2)(iii)(A)(2), a dual 
resident corporation or domestic owner shall be considered to cease to 
be a member of the consolidated group if it is no longer a member of the 
group within the meaning of Sec. 1.1502-1(b), or if the group ceases to 
exist because the common parent is no longer in existence or is no 
longer a common parent or the group no longer files on the basis of a 
consolidated return. Such disaffiliation, however, shall not constitute 
a triggering event if the taxpayer demonstrates, to the satisfaction of 
the Commissioner, that the dual resident corporation's or separate 
unit's losses, expenses, or deductions cannot be used to offset income 
of another person under the laws of a foreign country at any time after 
the affiliated dual resident corporation or affiliated domestic owner 
ceases to be a member of the consolidated group;
    (3) An unaffiliated dual resident corporation or unaffiliated 
domestic owner becomes a member of a consolidated group. Such 
affiliation of the dual resident corporation or domestic owner, however, 
shall not constitute a triggering event if the taxpayer demonstrates, to 
the satisfaction of the Commissioner, that the losses, expenses, or 
deductions of the dual resident corporation or separate unit cannot be 
used to offset the income of another person under the laws of a foreign 
country at any time after the dual resident corporation or domestic 
owner becomes a member of the consolidated group.
    (4) A dual resident corporation transfers assets in a transaction 
that results, under the laws of a foreign country, in a carryover of its 
losses, expenses, or deductions. For purposes of this paragraph 
(g)(2)(iii)(A)(4), a transfer, either in a single transaction or a 
series of transactions within a twelve-month period, of 50% or more of 
the dual resident corporation's assets (measured by the fair market 
value of the assets at the time of such transfer (or for multiple 
transactions, at the time of the first transfer)) shall be deemed a 
triggering event, unless the taxpayer demonstrates, to the satisfaction 
of the Commissioner, that the transfer of assets did not result in a 
carryover under foreign law of the dual resident corporation's losses, 
expenses, or deductions to the transferee of the assets;
    (5) A domestic owner of a separate unit transfers assets of the 
separate unit in a transaction that results, under the laws of a foreign 
country, in a carryover of the separate unit's losses, expenses, or 
deductions. For purposes of this paragraph (g)(2)(iii)(A)(5), a 
transfer, either in a single transaction or a series of transactions 
over a twelve-month period, of 50% or more of the separate unit's assets 
(measured by the fair market value of the assets at the time of the 
transfer (or for multiple transfers, at the time of the first 
transfer)), shall be deemed a triggering event, unless the

[[Page 553]]

taxpayer demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the Commissioner, that the 
transfer of assets did not result in a carryover under foreign law of 
the separate unit's losses, expenses, or deductions to the transferee of 
the assets;
    (6) An unaffiliated dual resident corporation or unaffiliated 
domestic owner becomes a foreign corporation by means of a transaction 
(e.g., a reorganization) that, for foreign tax purposes, is not treated 
as involving a transfer of assets (and carryover of losses) to a new 
entity. Such a transaction, however, shall not constitute a triggering 
event if the taxpayer demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the 
Commissioner, that the dual resident corporation's or separate unit's 
losses, expenses, or deductions cannot be used to offset income of 
another person under the laws of the foreign country at any time after 
the unaffiliated dual resident corporation or unaffiliated domestic 
owner becomes a foreign corporation.
    (7) A domestic owner of a separate unit, either in a single 
transaction or a series of transactions within a twelve-month period, 
sells, or otherwise disposes of, 50% or more of the interest in the 
separate unit (measured by voting power or value) owned by the domestic 
owner on the last day of the taxable year in which the dual consolidated 
loss was incurred. For purposes of this paragraph (g)(2)(iii)(A)(7), the 
domestic owner shall be deemed to have disposed of its entire interest 
in a hybrid entity separate unit if such hybrid entity becomes 
classified as a foreign corporation for U.S. tax purposes. The 
disposition of 50% or more of the interest in a separate unit, however, 
shall not constitute a triggering event if the taxpayer demonstrates, to 
the satisfaction of the Commissioner, that the losses, expenses, or 
deductions of the separate unit cannot be used to offset income of 
another person under the laws of the foreign country at any time after 
the disposition of the interest in the separate unit; or
    (8) The consolidated group, unaffiliated dual resident corporation, 
or unaffiliated domestic owner fails to file a certification required 
under paragraph (g)(2)(vi)(B) of this section.
    (B) A taxpayer wishing to rebut the presumption of a triggering 
event described in paragraphs (g)(2)(iii)(A)(2) through (7) of this 
section, by demonstrating that the losses, expenses, or deductions of 
the dual resident corporation or separate unit cannot be carried over or 
otherwise used under the laws of the foreign country, must attach 
documents demonstrating such facts to its timely filed U.S. income tax 
return for the year in which the presumed triggering event occurs.
    (C) The following example illustrates this paragraph (g)(2)(iii).

    Example. DRC, a domestic corporation, is a member of CG, a 
consolidated group. DRC is a resident Country Y for Country Y income tax 
purposes. Therefore, DRC is a dual resident corporation. In Year 1, DRC 
incurs a dual consolidated loss of $100. CG files an agreement described 
in paragraph (g)(2) of this section and, thus, the $100 dual 
consolidated loss is included in the computation of CG's consolidated 
taxable income. In Year 6, all of the stock of DRC is sold to P, a 
domestic corporation that is a member of NG, another consolidated group. 
The sale of DRC to P is a triggering event under paragraph 
(g)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, requiring the recapture of the dual 
consolidated loss. However, the laws of Country Y provide for a five-
year carryover period for losses. At the time of DRC's disaffiliation 
from CG, the losses, expenses and deductions that were included in the 
computation of the dual consolidated loss had expired for Country Y 
purposes. Therefore, upon adequate documentation that the losses, 
expenses, or deductions have expired for Country Y purposes, CG can 
rebut the presumption that a triggering event has occurred.

    (iv) Exceptions--(A) Acquisition by a member of the consolidated 
group. The following events shall not constitute triggering events, 
requiring the recapture of the dual consolidated loss under paragraph 
(g)(2)(vii) of this section:
    (1) An affiliated dual resident corporation or affiliated domestic 
owner ceases to be a member of a consolidated group solely by reason of 
a transaction in which a member of the same consolidated group succeeds 
to the tax attributes of the dual resident corporation or domestic owner 
under the provisions of section 381;
    (2) Assets of an affiliated dual resident corporation or assets of a 
separate unit of an affiliated domestic owner

[[Page 554]]

are acquired by a member of its consolidated group in any other 
transaction; or
    (3) An affiliated domestic owner of a separate unit transfers its 
interest in the separate unit to another member of its consolidated 
group.
    (B) Acquisition by an unaffiliated domestic corporation or a new 
consolidated group--(1) If all the requirements of paragraph 
(g)(2)(iv)(B)(3) of this section are met, the following events shall not 
constitute triggering events requiring the recapture of the dual 
consolidated loss under paragraph (g)(2)(vii) of this section:
    (i) An affiliated dual resident corporation or affiliated domestic 
owner becomes an unaffiliated domestic corporation or a member of a new 
consolidated group (other than in a transaction described in paragraph 
(g)(2)(iv)(B)(2)(ii) of this section);
    (ii) Assets of a dual resident corporation or a separate unit are 
acquired by an unaffiliated domestic corporation or a member of a new 
consolidated group; or
    (iii) A domestic owner of a separate unit transfers its interest in 
the separate unit to an unaffiliated domestic corporation or to a member 
of a new consolidated group.
    (2) If the requirements of paragraph (g)(2)(iv)(B)(3)(iii) of this 
section are met, the following events shall not constitute triggering 
events requiring the recapture of the dual consolidated loss under 
paragraph (g)(2)(vii) of this section--
    (i) An unaffiliated dual resident corporation or unaffiliated 
domestic owner becomes a member of a consolidated group;
    (ii) A consolidated group that filed an agreement under this 
paragraph (g)(2) ceases to exist as a result of a transaction described 
in Sec. 1.1502-13(j)(5)(i) (other than a transaction in which any 
member of the terminating group, or the successor-in-interest of such 
member, is not a member of the surviving group immediately after the 
terminating group ceases to exist).
    (3) If the following requirements (as applicable) are satisfied, the 
events listed in paragraphs (g)(2)(iv)(B)(1) and (2) of this section 
shall not constitute triggering events requiring recapture under 
paragraph (g)(2)(vii) of this section.
    (i) The consolidated group, unaffiliated dual resident corporation, 
or unaffiliated domestic owner that filed the agreement under this 
paragraph (g)(2) and the unaffiliated domestic corporation or new 
consolidated group must enter into a closing agreement with the Internal 
Revenue Service providing that the consolidated group, unaffiliated dual 
resident corporation, or unaffiliated domestic owner and the 
unaffiliated domestic corporation or new consolidated group will be 
jointly and severally liable for the total amount of the recapture of 
dual consolidated loss and interest charge required in paragraph 
(g)(2)(vii) of this section, if there is a triggering event described in 
paragraph (g)(2)(iii) of this section;
    (ii) The unaffiliated domestic corporation or new consolidated group 
must agree to treat any potential recapture amount under paragraph 
(g)(2)(vii) of this section as unrealized built-in gain for purposes of 
section 384(a), subject to any applicable exceptions thereunder;
    (iii) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1503-
2T(g)(2)(iv)(B)(3)(iii).
    (C) Subsequent triggering events. Any triggering event described in 
paragraph (g)(2)(iii) of this section that occurs subsequent to one of 
the transactions described in paragraph (g)(2)(iv) (A) or (B) of this 
section and does not fall within the exceptions provided in paragraph 
(g)(2)(iv) (A) or (B) of this section shall require recapture under 
paragraph (g)(2)(vii) of this section.
    (D) Example. The following example illustrates the application of 
paragraph (g)(2)(iv)(B)(2)(ii) of this section:

    Example. (i) Facts. C is the common parent of a consolidated group 
(the C Group) that includes DRC, a domestic corporation. DRC is a dual 
resident corporation and incurs a dual consolidated loss in its taxable 
year ending December 31, Year 1. The C Group elects to be bound by the 
provisions of this paragraph (g)(2) with respect to the Year 1 dual 
consolidated loss. No member of the C Group incurs a dual consolidated 
loss in Year 2. On December 31, Year 2, stock of C is acquired by D in a 
transaction described in Sec. 1.1502-13(j)(5)(i). As a result of the 
acquisition, all the C Group members, including DRC, become members of a 
consolidated group of which D is the common parent (the D Group).

[[Page 555]]

    (ii) Acquisition not a triggering event. Under paragraph 
(g)(2)(iv)(B)(2)(ii) of this section, the acquisition by D of the C 
Group is not an event requiring the recapture of the Year 1 dual 
consolidated loss of DRC, or the payment of an interest charge, as 
described in paragraph (g)(2)(vii) of this section, provided that the D 
Group files the new (g)(2)(i) agreement described in paragraph 
(g)(2)(iv)(B)(3)(iii) of this section.
    (iii) Subsequent event. A triggering event occurs on December 31, 
Year 3, that requires recapture by the D Group of the dual consolidated 
loss that DRC incurred in Year 1, as well as the payment of an interest 
charge, as provided in paragraph (g)(2)(vii) of this section. Each 
member of the D Group, including DRC and the other former members of the 
C Group, is severally liable for the additional tax (and the interest 
charge) due upon the recapture of the dual consolidated loss of DRC.
    (v) Ordering rules for determining the foreign use of losses. If the 
laws of a foreign country provide for the use of losses of a dual 
resident corporation to offset the income of another person but do not 
provide applicable rules for determining the order in which such losses 
are used to offset the income of another person in a taxable year, then 
for purposes of this section, the following rules shall govern:
    (A) If under the laws of the foreign country the dual resident 
corporation has losses from different taxable years, the dual resident 
corporation shall be deemed to use first the losses from the earliest 
taxable year from which a loss may be carried forward or back for 
foreign law purposes.
    (B) Any net loss, or income, that the dual resident corporation has 
in a taxable year shall first be used to offset net income, or loss, 
recognized by affiliates of the dual resident corporation in the same 
taxable year before any carryover of the dual resident corporation's 
losses is considered to be used to offset any income from the taxable 
year.
    (C) Where different losses, expenses, or deductions (e.g., capital 
losses and ordinary losses) of a dual resident corporation incurred in 
the same taxable year are available to offset the income of another 
person, the different losses shall be deemed to offset such income on a 
pro rata basis.

    Example. DRC, a domestic corporation, is taxed as a resident under 
the tax laws of Country Y. Therefore, DRC is a dual resident 
corporation. FA is a Country Y affiliate of DRC. Country Y's tax laws 
permit affiliated corporations to file a form of consolidated return. In 
Year 1, DRC incurs a capital loss of $80 which, for Country Y purposes, 
offsets completely $30 of capital gain recognized by FA. Neither 
corporation has any other taxable income or loss for the year. In Year 1 
(and in other years), DRC recognizes the same amount of income for U.S. 
purposes as it does for Country Y purposes. Under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of 
this section, however, DRC's $80 capital loss is not a dual consolidated 
loss. In Year 2, DRC incurs a net operating loss of $100, while FA 
incurs a net operating loss of $50. DRC's $100 loss is a dual 
consolidated loss. Since the dual consolidated loss is not used to 
offset the income of another person under Country Y law, DRC is 
permitted to file an agreement described in this paragraph (g)(2). In 
Year 3, DRC has a net operating loss of $10 and FA has capital gains of 
$60. For Country Y purposes, DRC's $10 net operating loss is used to 
offset $10 of FA's $60 capital gain. DRC's $10 loss is a dual 
consolidated loss. Because the loss is used to offset FA's income, DRC 
will not be able to file an agreement under this paragraph (g)(2) with 
respect to the loss. Country Y permits FA's remaining $50 of Year 3 
income to be offset by carryover losses. However, Country Y has no 
applicable rules for determining which carryover losses from Years 1 and 
2 are used to offset such income. Under the ordering rules of paragraph 
(g)(2)(v)(A) of this section, none of DRC's $100 Year 2 loss will be 
deemed to offset FA's remaining $50 of Year 3 income. Instead, the $50 
of capital loss carryover from Year 1 will be considered to offset the 
income.

    (vi) Reporting requirements--(A) In general. The consolidated group, 
unaffiliated dual resident corporation, or unaffiliated domestic owner 
must answer the applicable questions regarding dual consolidated losses 
on its U.S. income tax return filed for the year in which the dual 
consolidated loss is incurred and for each of the following fifteen 
taxable years.
    (B) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1503-
2T(g)(2)(vi)(B).
    (C) Exception. A consolidated group or unaffiliated domestic owner 
is not required to file annual certifications under paragraph 
(g)(2)(vi)(B) of this section with respect to a dual consolidated loss 
of any separate unit other than a hybrid entity separate unit.
    (vii) Recapture of loss and interest charge--(A) Presumptive rule--
(1)

[[Page 556]]

Amount of recapture. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph 
(g)(2)(vii), upon the occurrence of a triggering event described in 
paragraph (g)(2)(iii) of this section, the taxpayer shall recapture and 
report as gross income the total amount of the dual consolidated loss to 
which the triggering event applies on its income tax return for the 
taxable year in which the triggering event occurs (or, when the 
triggering event is a use of the loss for foreign tax purposes, the 
taxable year that includes the last day of the foreign tax year during 
which such use occurs).
    (2) Interest charge. In connection with the recapture, the taxpayer 
shall pay an interest charge. Except as otherwise provided in this 
paragraph (g)(2)(vii), such interest shall be determined under the rules 
of section 6601(a) as if the additional tax owed as a result of the 
recapture had accrued and been due and owing for the taxable year in 
which the losses, expenses, or deductions taken into account in 
computing the dual consolidated loss gave rise to a tax benefit for U.S. 
income tax purposes. For purposes of this paragraph (g)(2)(vii)(A)(2), a 
tax benefit shall be considered to have arisen in a taxable year in 
which such losses, expenses or deductions reduced U.S. taxable income.
    (B) Rebuttal of presumptive rule--(1) Amount of recapture. The 
amount of dual consolidated loss that must be recaptured under this 
paragraph (g)(2)(vii) may be reduced if the taxpayer demonstrates, to 
the satisfaction of the Commissioner, the offset permitted by this 
paragraph (g)(2)(vii)(B). The reduction in the amount of recapture is 
the amount by which the dual consolidated loss would have offset other 
taxable income reported on a timely filed U.S. income tax return for any 
taxable year up to and including the year of the triggering event if 
such loss had been subject to the restrictions of paragraph (b) of this 
section (and therefore had been subject to the separate return 
limitation year restrictions of Sec. Sec. 1.1502-21A(c) or 1.1502-
21(c) (as appropriate) commencing in the taxable year in which the loss 
was incurred. A taxpayer utilizing this rebuttal rule must attach to its 
timely filed U.S. income tax return a separate accounting showing that 
the income for each year that offsets the dual resident corporation's or 
separate unit's recapture amount is attributable only to the dual 
resident corporation or separate unit.
    (2) Interest charge. The interest charge imposed under this 
paragraph (g)(2)(vii) may be appropriately reduced if the taxpayer 
demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the Commissioner, that the net 
interest owed would have been less than that provided in paragraph 
(g)(2)(vii)(A)(2) of this section if the taxpayer had filed an amended 
return for the year in which the loss was incurred, and for any other 
affected years up to and including the year of recapture, treating the 
dual consolidated loss as a loss subject to the restrictions of 
paragraph (b) of this section (and therefore subject to the separate 
return limitation year restrictions of Sec. Sec. 1.1502-21A(c) or 
1.1502-21(c) (as appropriate). A taxpayer utilizing this rebuttal rule 
must attach to its timely filed U.S. income tax return a computation 
demonstrating the reduction in the net interest owed as a result of 
treating the dual consolidated loss as a loss subject to the 
restrictions of paragraph (b) of this section.
    (C) Computation of taxable income in year of recapture--(1) 
Presumptive rule. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph 
(g)(2)(vii)(C)(2) of this section, for purposes of computing the taxable 
income for the year of recapture, no current, carryover or carryback 
losses of the dual resident corporation or separate unit, of other 
members of the consolidated group, or of the domestic owner that are not 
attributable to the separate unit, may offset and absorb the recapture 
amount.
    (2) Rebuttal of presumptive rule. The recapture amount included in 
gross income may be offset and absorbed by that portion of the 
taxpayer's (consolidated or separate) net operating loss carryover that 
is attributable to the dual consolidated loss being recaptured, if the 
taxpayer demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the Commissioner, the 
amount of such portion of the carryover. A taxpayer utilizing this 
rebuttal rule must attach to its timely filed U.S. income tax return a 
computation

[[Page 557]]

demonstrating the amount of net operating loss carryover that, under 
this paragraph (g)(2)(vii)(C)(2), may absorb the recapture amount 
included in gross income.
    (D) Character and source of recapture income. The amount recaptured 
under this paragraph (g)(2)(vii) shall be treated as ordinary income in 
the year of recapture. The amount recaptured shall be treated as income 
having the same source and falling within the same separate category for 
purposes of section 904 as the dual consolidated loss being recaptured.
    (E) Reconstituted net operating loss. Commencing in the taxable year 
immediately following the year in which the dual consolidated loss is 
recaptured, the dual resident corporation or separate unit shall be 
treated as having a net operating loss in an amount equal to the amount 
actually recaptured under paragraph (g)(2)(vii) (A) or (B) of this 
section. This reconstituted net operating loss shall be subject to the 
restrictions of paragraph (b) of this section (and therefore, the 
separate return limitation year restrictions of Sec. Sec. 1.1502-
21A(c) or 1.1502-21T(c) (as appropriate). The net operating loss shall 
be available only for carryover, under section 172(b), to taxable years 
following the taxable year of recapture. For purposes of determining the 
remaining carryover period, the loss shall be treated as if it had been 
recognized in the taxable year in which the dual consolidated loss that 
is the basis of the recapture amount was incurred.
    (F) Consequences of failing to comply with recapture provisions--(1) 
In general. If the taxpayer fails to comply with the recapture 
provisions of this paragraph (g)(2)(vii) upon the occurrence of a 
triggering event, then the dual resident corporation or separate unit 
that incurred the dual consolidated loss (or a successor-in-interest) 
shall not be eligible for the relief provided in paragraph (g)(2) of 
this section with respect to any dual consolidated losses incurred in 
the five taxable years beginning with the taxable year in which 
recapture is required.
    (2) Exceptions. In the case of a triggering event other than a use 
of the losses, expenses, or deductions taken into account in computing 
the dual consolidated loss to offset income of another person under the 
income tax laws of a foreign country, this rule shall not apply in the 
following circumstances:
    (i) The failure to recapture is due to reasonable cause; or
    (ii) A taxpayer seeking to rebut the presumption of a triggering 
event satisfies the filing requirements of paragraph (g)(2)(iii)(B) of 
this section.
    (G) Examples. The following examples illustrate this paragraph 
(g)(2)(vii).

    Example 1. P, a domestic corporation, files a consolidated return 
with DRC, a dual resident corporation. In Year 1, DRC incurs a dual 
consolidated loss of $100 and P earns $100. P files an agreement under 
this paragraph (g)(2). Therefore, the consolidated group is permitted to 
offset P's $100 of income with DRC's $100 loss. In Year 2, DRC earns 
$30, which is completely offset by a $30 net operating loss incurred by 
P. In Year 3, DRC earns income of $25 while P recognizes no income or 
loss. In addition, there is a triggering event in Year 3. Therefore, 
under the presumptive rule of paragraph (g)(2)(vii)(A) of this section, 
DRC must recapture $100. However, the $100 recapture amount may be 
reduced by $25 (the amount by which the dual consolidated loss would 
have offset other taxable income if it had been subject to the separate 
return limitation year restrictions from Year 1) upon adequate 
documentation of such offset under paragraph (g)(2)(vii)(B)(1) of this 
section. Commencing in Year 4, the $100 (or $75) recapture amount is 
treated as a loss incurred by DRC in a separate return limitation year, 
subject to the restrictions of Sec. Sec. 1.1502-21A(c) or 1.1502-
21(c), as appropriate. The carryover period of the loss, for purposes of 
section 172(b), will start from Year 1, when the dual consolidated loss 
was incurred.
    Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that in 
Year 2, DRC earns $75 and P earns $50. In Year 3, DRC earns $25 while P 
earns $30. A triggering event occurs in Year 3. The $100 presumptive 
amount of recapture can be reduced to zero by the $75 and $25 earned by 
DRC in Years 2 and 3, respectively, upon adequate documentation of such 
offset under paragraph (g)(2)(vii)(B)(1) of this section. Nevertheless, 
an interest charge will be owed. Under the presumptive rule of paragraph 
(g)(2)(vii)(A)(2) of this section, interest will be charged on the 
additional tax owed on the $100 of recapture income as if the tax had 
accrued in Year 1 (the year in which the dual consolidated loss reduced 
the income of P). However, the net interest will be reduced to the 
amount that would have been owed if the consolidated group had filed 
amended returns, treating

[[Page 558]]

the dual consolidated loss as a loss subject to the separate return 
limitation year restrictions of Sec. 1.1502-21A(c) or 1.1502-21(c), as 
appropriate, upon adequate documentation of such reduction of interest 
under paragraph (g)(2)(vii)(B)(2) of this section.
    Example 3. P, a domestic corporation, owns DRC, a domestic 
corporation that is subject to the income tax laws of Country Z on a 
residence basis. DRC owns FE, a Country Z corporation. In Year 1, DRC 
incurs a net operating loss for U.S. tax purposes. Under the tax laws of 
Country Z, the loss is not recognized until Year 3. The Year 1 net 
operating loss is a dual consolidated loss under paragraph (c)(5) of 
this section. The consolidated group elects relief under paragraph 
(g)(2) of this section by filing the appropriate agreement and uses the 
dual consolidated loss on its U.S. income tax return. In Year 3, the 
dual consolidated loss is used under the laws of Country Z to offset the 
income of FE, which is a triggering event under paragraph (g)(2)(iii) of 
this section. However, the consolidated group does not recapture the 
dual consolidated loss. The consolidated group's failure to comply with 
the recapture provisions of this paragraph (g)(2)(vii) prevents DRC from 
being eligible for the relief provided under paragraph (g)(2) of this 
section for any dual consolidated losses incurred in Years 3 through 7, 
inclusive.

    (h) Effective date--(1) In general. These regulations are effective 
for taxable years beginning on or after October 1, 1992. Section 1.1503-
2A is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, and 
before October 1, 1992. Paragraph (g)(2)(iv)(B)(2) of this section shall 
apply with respect to transactions otherwise constituting triggering 
events occurring on or after January 1, 2002.
    (2) Taxpayers that have filed for relief under Sec. 1.1503-2A--(i) 
In general. Except as provided in paragraph (h)(ii)(b) of this section, 
taxpayers that have filed agreements described in Sec. 1.1503-2A(c)(3) 
or certifications described in Sec. 1.1503-2A(d)(3) shall continue to 
be subject to the provisions of such agreements or certifications, 
including the amended return or recapture requirements applicable in the 
event of a triggering event, for the remaining term of such agreements 
or certifications.
    (ii) Special transition rule. A taxpayer that has filed an agreement 
described in Sec. 1.1503-2A(c)(3) or a certification described in Sec. 
1.1503-2A(d)(3) and that is in compliance with the provisions of Sec. 
1.1503-2A may elect to replace such agreement or certification with an 
agreement described in paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section. However, a 
taxpayer making this election must replace all agreements and 
certifications filed under Sec. 1.1503-2A. If the taxpayer is a 
consolidated group, the election must be made with respect to all dual 
resident corporations or separate units within the group. Likewise, if 
the taxpayer is an unaffiliated domestic owner, the election must be 
made with respect to all separate units of the domestic owner. The 
taxpayer must file the replacement agreement with its timely filed 
income tax return for its first taxable year commencing on or after 
October 1, 1992, stating that such agreement is a replacement for the 
agreement filed under Sec. 1.1503-2A(c)(3) or the certification filed 
under Sec. 1.1503-2A(d)(3) and identifying the taxable year for which 
the original agreement or certification was filed. A single agreement 
described in paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section may be filed to replace 
more than one agreement or certification filed under Sec. 1.1503-2A; 
however, each dual consolidated loss must be separately identified. A 
taxpayer may also elect to apply Sec. 1.1503-2 for all open years, with 
respect to agreements filed under Sec. 1.1503-2A(c)(3) or 
certifications filed under Sec. 1.1503-2A(d)(3), in cases where the 
agreement or certification is no longer in effect and the taxpayer has 
complied with the provisions of Sec. 1.1503-2A. For example, a taxpayer 
may have had a triggering event under Sec. 1.1503-2A that is not a 
triggering event under Sec. 1.1503-2. If the taxpayer fully complied 
with the requirements of the agreement entered into under Sec. 1.1503-
2A(c)(3) and filed amended U.S. income tax returns within the time 
required under Sec. 1.1503-2A(c)(3), the taxpayer may file amended U.S. 
income tax returns consistent with the position that the earlier 
triggering event is no longer a triggering event.
    (3) Taxpayers that are in compliance with Sec. 1.1503-2A but have 
not filed for relief thereunder. A taxpayer that is in compliance with 
the provisions of Sec. 1.1503-2A but has not filed an agreement 
described in Sec. 1.1503-2A(c)(3) or a certification described in Sec. 
1.1503-

[[Page 559]]

2A(d)(3) may elect to have the provisions of Sec. 1.1503-2 apply for 
any open year. In particular, a taxpayer may elect to apply the 
provisions of Sec. 1.1503-2 in a case where the dual consolidated loss 
has been subjected to the separate return limitation year restrictions 
of Sec. 1.1502-21A(c) or 1.1502-21(c) (as appropriate) but the losses, 
expenses, or deductions taken into account in computing the dual 
consolidated loss have not been used to offset the income of another 
person for foreign tax purposes. However, if a taxpayer is a 
consolidated group, the election must be made with respect to all dual 
resident corporations or separate units within the group. Likewise, if 
the taxpayer is an unaffiliated domestic owner, the election must be 
made with respect to all separate units of the domestic owner.

    (a) through (g)(1) [Reserved]. For fur- ther guidance, see Sec. 
1.1503-2(a) through (g)(1).
    (2) Elective relief provision--(i) In general. Paragraph (b) of this 
section shall not apply to a dual consolidated loss if the consolidated 
group, unaffiliated dual resident corporation, or unaffiliated domestic 
owner elects to be bound by the provisions of Sec. 1.1503-2(g)(2) and 
this paragraph (g)(2). In order to elect relief under Sec. 1.1503-
2(g)(2) and this paragraph (g)(2), the consolidated group, unaffiliated 
dual resident corporation, or unaffiliated domestic owner must attach to 
its timely filed U.S. income tax return for the taxable year in which 
the dual consolidated loss is incurred an agreement described in 
paragraph (g)(2)(i)(A) of this section. The agreement must be signed 
under penalties of perjury by the person who signs the return. For 
taxable years beginning after December 31, 2002, the agreement attached 
to the income tax return of the consolidated group, unaffiliated dual 
resident corporation or unaffiliated domestic owner pursuant to the 
preceding sentence may be an unsigned copy. If an unsigned copy is 
attached to the return, the consolidated group, unaffiliated dual 
resident corporation, or unaffiliated domestic owner must retain the 
original in its records in the manner specified by Sec. 1.6001-1(e). 
The agreement must include the following items, in paragraphs labeled to 
correspond with the items set forth in paragraphs (g)(2)(i)(A) through 
(F) of this section:
    (A) A statement that the document submitted is an election and an 
agreement under the provisions of Sec. 1.1503-2(g)(2) of the Income Tax 
Regulations.
    (B) The name, address, identifying number, and place and date of 
incorporation of the dual resident corporation, and the country or 
countries that tax the dual resident corporation on its worldwide income 
or on a residence basis, or, in the case of a separate unit, 
identification of the separate unit, including the name under which it 
conducts business, its principal activity, and the country in which its 
principal place of business is located.
    (C) An agreement by the consolidated group, unaffiliated dual 
resident corporation, or unaffiliated domestic owner to comply with all 
of the provisions of paragraphs (g)(2)(iii) through (vii) of Sec. 
1.1503-2 and this section.
    (D) A statement of the amount of the dual consolidated loss covered 
by the agreement.
    (E) A certification that no portion of the dual resident 
corporation's or separate unit's losses, expenses, or deductions taken 
into account in computing the dual consolidated loss has been, or will 
be, used to offset the income of any other person under the income tax 
laws of a foreign country.
    (F) A certification that arrangements have been made to ensure that 
no portion of the dual consolidated loss will be used to offset the 
income of another person under the laws of a foreign country and that 
the consolidated group, unaffiliated dual resident corporation, or 
unaffiliated domestic owner will be informed of any such foreign use of 
any portion of the dual consolidated loss.

see Sec. 1.1503-2(g)(2)(ii) through (iv)(B)(3)(ii).
    (g)(2)(iv)(B)(3)(iii) The unaffiliated domestic corporation or new 
consolidated group must file, with its timely filed income tax return 
for the taxable year in which the event described in Sec. 1.1503-
2(g)(2)(iv)(B)(1) or (2) occurs, an agreement described in paragraph 
(g)(2)(i) of this section (new (g)(2)(i) agreement), whereby it assumes 
the same obligations with respect to the dual consolidated loss as the 
corporation or consolidated group that filed the original (g)(2)(i) 
agreement with respect to that loss. The new (g)(2)(i) agreement must be 
signed under penalties of perjury by the person who signs the return and 
must include a reference to Sec. 1.1503-2(g)(2)(iv)(B)(3)(iii) or this 
paragraph (g)(2)(iv)(B)(3)(iii). For taxable years beginning after 
December 31, 2002, the agreement attached to the return pursuant to the 
preceding sentence may be an unsigned copy. If an unsigned copy is 
attached to the return, the corporation or consolidated group must 
retain the original in its records in the manner specified by Sec. 
1.6001-1(e).
    (g)(2)(iv)(C) through (vi)(A) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see 
Sec. 1.1503-2(g)(2)(iv)(C) through (vi)(A).
    (B) Annual certification. Except as provided in Sec. 1.1503-
2(g)(2)(vi)(C), until and unless Form 1120 or the Schedules thereto 
contain questions pertaining to dual consolidated losses, the 
consolidated group, unaffiliated dual resident corporation, or 
unaffiliated domestic owner must file with its income tax return for 
each of the 15 taxable years following the taxable year in which the 
dual consolidated loss is incurred a certification that the losses, 
expenses, or deductions that make up the dual consolidated loss have not 
been used to offset the income of another person under the tax laws of a 
foreign country. For taxable years beginning before January 1, 2003, the 
annual certification must be signed under penalties of perjury by a 
person authorized to sign the agreement described in paragraph (g)(2)(i) 
of this section. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2002, 
the certification is verified by signing the return with which the 
certification is filed. The certification for a taxable year must 
identify the dual consolidated loss to which it pertains by setting 
forth the taxpayer's year in which the loss was incurred and the amount 
of such loss. In addition, the certification must warrant that 
arrangements have been made to ensure that the loss will not be used to 
offset the income of another person under the laws of a foreign country 
and that the taxpayer will be informed of any such foreign use of any 
portion of the loss. If dual consolidated losses of more than one 
taxable year are subject to the rules of this paragraph (g)(2)(vi)(B), 
the certifications for those years may be combined in a single document 
but each dual consolidated loss must be separately identified.
    (g)(2)(vii) through (h) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see Sec. 
1.1503-2(g)(2)(vi) through (h).

of an affiliated group and the corporations which may be considered as 
includible corporations.

Sec. Sec. 1.1504-2--1.1504-3  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1.1504-4  Treatment of warrants, options, convertible obligations, 
and other similar interests.

    (a) Introduction--(1) General rule. This section provides 
regulations under section 1504(a)(5) (A) and (B) regarding the 
circumstances in which warrants, options, obligations convertible into 
stock, and other similar interests are treated as exercised for purposes 
of determining whether a corporation is a member of an affiliated group. 
The fact that an instrument may be treated as an option under these 
regulations does not prevent such instrument from being treated as stock 
under general principles of law. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) 
of this section, this section applies to all provisions under the 
Internal Revenue Code and the regulations to which affiliation within 
the meaning of section 1504(a) (with or without the exceptions in 
section 1504(b)) is relevant, including those provisions that refer to 
section 1504(a)(2) (with or without the exceptions in section 1504(b)) 
without referring to affiliation, provided that the 80 percent voting 
power and 80 percent value requirements of section 1504(a)(2) are not 
modified therein.
    (2) Exceptions. This section does not apply to sections 163(j), 
864(e), or 904(i) or to the regulations thereunder. This section also 
does not apply to any other provision specified by the Internal Revenue 
Service in regulations, a revenue ruling, or revenue procedure. See 
Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter.
    (b) Options not treated as stock or as excerised--(1) General rule. 
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, an option is not 
considered either as stock or as exercised. Thus, options are 
disregarded in determining whether a corporation is a member of an 
affiliated group unless they are described in paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section.
    (2) Options treated as exercised--(i) In general. Solely for 
purposes of determining whether a corporation is a member of an 
affiliated group, an option is treated as exercised if, on a

[[Page 562]]

measurement date with respect to such option--
    (A) It could reasonably be anticipated that, if not for this 
section, the issuance or transfer of the option in lieu of the issuance, 
redemption, or transfer of the underlying stock would result in the 
elimination of a substantial amount of federal income tax liability (as 
described in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section); and
    (B) It is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised (as 
described in paragraph (g) of this section).
    (ii) Aggregation of options. All options with the same measurement 
date are aggregated in determining whether the issuance or transfer of 
an option in lieu of the issuance, redemption, or transfer of the 
underlying stock would result in the elimination of a substantial amount 
of federal income tax liability.
    (iii) Effect of treating option as exercised--(A) In general. An 
option that is treated as exercised is treated as exercised for purposes 
of determining the percentage of the value of stock owned by the holder 
and other parties, but is not treated as exercised for purposes of 
determining the percentage of the voting power of stock owned by the 
holder and other parties.
    (B) Cash settlement options, phantom stock, stock appreciation 
rights, or similar interests. If a cash settlement option, phantom 
stock, stock appreciation right, or similar interest is treated as 
exercised, the option is treated as having been converted into stock of 
the issuing corporation. If the amount to be received upon the exercise 
of such an option is determined by reference to a multiple of the 
increase in the value of a share of the issuing corporation's stock on 
the exercise date over the value of a share of the stock on the date the 
option is issued, the option is treated as converted into a 
corresponding number of shares of such stock. Appropriate adjustments 
must be made in any situation in which the amount to be received upon 
exercise of the option is determined in another manner.
    (iv) Valuation. For purposes of section 1504(a)(2)(B) and this 
section, all shares of stock within a single class are considered to 
have the same value. Thus, control premiums and minority and blockage 
discounts within a single class are not taken into account.
    (3) Example. The provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section may 
be illustrated by the following example:

    Example. (i) Corporation P owns all 100 shares of the common stock 
of Corporation S, the only class of S stock outstanding. Each share of S 
stock has a fair market value of $10 and has one vote. On June 30, 1992, 
P issues to Corporation X an option to acquire 80 shares of the S stock 
from P.
    (ii) If, under the provisions of this section, the option is treated 
as exercised, then, solely for purposes of determining affiliation, P is 
treated as owning only 20 percent of the value of the outstanding S 
stock and X is treated as owing the remaining 80 percent of the value of 
the S stock. P is still treated as owning all of the voting power of S. 
Accordingly, because P is treated as owning less than 80 percent of the 
value of the outstanding S stock, P and S are no longer affiliated. 
However, because X is not treated as owning any of the voting power of 
S, X and S are also not affiliated.

    (c) Definitions. For purposes of this section--
    (1) Issuing corporation. ``Issuing corporation'' means the 
corporation whose stock is subject to an option.
    (2) Related or sequential option. ``Related or sequential option'' 
means an option that is one of a series of options issued to the same or 
related persons. For purposes of this section, any options issued to the 
same person or related persons within a two-year period are presumed to 
be part of a series of options. This presumption may be rebutted if the 
facts and circumstances clearly establish that the options are not part 
of a series of options. Any options issued to the same person or related 
persons more than two years apart are presumed not to be part of a 
series of options. This presumption may be rebutted if the facts and 
circumstances clearly establish that the options are part of a series of 
options.
    (3) Related persons. Persons are related if they are related within 
the meaning of section 267(b) (without the application of sections 
267(c) and 1563(e)(1)) or 707(b)(1), substituting ``10 percent'' for 
``50 percent'' wherever it appears.
    (4) Measurement date--(i) General rule. ``Measurement date'' means a 
date on which an option is issued or transferred or on which the terms 
of an existing

[[Page 563]]

option or the underlying stock are adjusted (including an adjustment 
pursuant to the terms of the option or the underlying stock).
    (ii) Issuances, transfers, or adjustments not treated as measurement 
dates. A measurement date does not include a date on which--
    (A) An option is issued or transferred by gift, at death, or between 
spouses or former spouses under section 1041;
    (B) An option is issued or transferred--
    (1) Between members of an affiliated group (determined with the 
exceptions in section 1504(b) and without the application of this 
section); or
    (2) Between persons none of which is a member of the affiliated 
group (determined without the exceptions in section 1504(b) and without 
the application of this section), if any, of which the issuing 
corporation is a member, unless--
    (i) Any such person is related to (or acting in concert with) the 
issuing corporation or any member of its affiliated group; and
    (ii) The issuance or transfer is pursuant to a plan a principal 
purpose of which is to avoid the application of section 1504 and this 
section;
    (C) An adjustment occurs in the terms or pursuant to the terms of an 
option or the underlying stock that does not materially increase the 
likelihood that the option will be exercised; or
    (D) A change occurs in the exercise price of an option or in the 
number of shares that may be issued or transferred pursuant to the 
option as determined by a bona fide, reasonable, adjustment formula that 
has the effect of preventing dilution of the interests of the holders of 
the options.
    (iii) Transactions increasing likelihood of exercise. If a change or 
alteration referred to in this paragraph (c)(4)(iii) is made for a 
principal purpose of increasing the likelihood that an option will be 
exercised, a measurement date also includes any date on which--
    (A) The capital structure of the issuing corporation is changed; or
    (B) The fair market value of the stock of the issuing corporation is 
altered through a transfer of assets to or from the issuing corporation 
(other than regular, ordinary dividends) or by any other means.
    (iv) Measurement date for options issued pursuant to a plan. In the 
case of options issued pursuant to a plan, a measurement date for any of 
the options constitutes a measurement date for all options issued 
pursuant to the plan that are outstanding on the measurement date.
    (v) Measurement date for related or sequential options. In the case 
of related or sequential options, a measurement date for any of the 
options constitutes a measurement date for all related or sequential 
options that are outstanding on the measurement date.
    (vi) Example. The provisions of paragraph (c)(4)(v) of this section 
may be illustrated by the following example.

    Example. (i) Corporation P owns all 80 shares of the common stock of 
Corporation S, the only class of S stock outstanding. On January 1, 
1992, S issues a warrant, exercisable within 3 years, to U, an unrelated 
corporation, to acquire 10 newly issued shares of S common stock. On 
July 1, 1992, S issues a second warrant to U to acquire 10 additional 
newly issued shares of S common stock. On January 1, 1993, S issues a 
third warrant to T, a wholly owned subsidiary of U, to acquire 10 newly 
issued shares of S common stock. Assume that the facts and circumstances 
do not clearly establish that the options are not part of a series of 
options.
    (ii) January 1, 1992, July 1, 1992, and January 1, 1993, constitute 
measurement dates for the first warrant, the second warrant, and the 
third warrant, respectively, because the warrants were issued on those 
dates.
    (iii) Because the first and second warrants were issued within two 
years of each other, and both warrants were issued to U, the warrants 
constitute related or sequential options. Accordingly, July 1, 1992, 
constitutes a measurement date for the first warrant as well as for the 
second warrant.
    (iv) Because the first, second, and third warrants were all issued 
within two years of each other, and were all issued to the same or 
related persons, the warrants constitute related or sequential options. 
Accordingly, January 1, 1993, constitutes a measurement date for the 
first and second warrants, as well as for the third warrant.

    (5) In-the-money. ``In-the-money'' means the exercise price of the 
option is less than (or in the case of an option to sell stock, greater 
than) the fair market value of the underlying stock.

[[Page 564]]

    (d) Options--(1) Instruments treated as options. For purposes of 
this section, except to the extent otherwise provided in this paragraph 
(d), the following are treated as options:
    (i) A call option, warrant, convertible obligation, put option, 
redemption agreement (including a right to cause the redemption of 
stock), or any other instrument that provides for the right to issue, 
redeem, or transfer stock (including an option on an option); and
    (ii) A cash settlement option, phantom stock, stock appreciation 
right, or any other similar interest (except for stock).
    (2) Instruments generally not treated as options. For purposes of 
this section, the following will not be treated as options:
    (i) Options on section 1504(a)(4) stock. Options on stock described 
in section 1504(a)(4);
    (ii) Certain publicly traded options--(A) General rule. Options 
which on the measurement date are traded on (or subject to the rules of) 
a qualified board or exchange as defined in section 1256(g)(7), or on 
any other exchange, board of trade, or market specified by the Internal 
Revenue Service in regulations, a revenue ruling, or revenue procedure. 
See Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter;
    (B) Exception. Paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section does not 
apply to options issued, transferred, or listed with a principal purpose 
of avoiding the application of section 1504 and this section. For 
example, a principal purpose of avoiding the application of section 1504 
and this section may exist if warrants, convertible or exchangeable debt 
instruments, or other similar instruments have an exercise price (or, in 
the case of convertible or exchangeable instruments, a conversion or 
exchange premium) that is materially less than, or a term that is 
materially longer than, those that are customary for publicly traded 
instruments of their type. A principal purpose may also exist if a large 
percentage of an issuance of an instrument is placed with one investor 
(or group of investors) and a very small percentage of the issuance is 
traded on a qualified board or exchange;
    (iii) Stock purchase agreements. Stock purchase agreements or 
similar arrangements whose terms are commercially reasonable and in 
which the parties' obligations to complete the transaction are subject 
only to reasonable closing conditions;
    (iv) Escrow, pledge, or other security agreements. Agreements for 
holding stock in escrow or under a pledge or other security agreement 
that are part of a typical commercial transaction and that are subject 
to customary commercial conditions;
    (v) Compensatory options--(A) General rule. Stock appreciation 
rights, warrants, stock options, phantom stock, or other similar 
instruments provided to employees, directors, or independent contractors 
in connection with the performance of services for the corporation or a 
related corporation (and that is not excessive by reference to the 
services performed) and which--
    (1) Are nontransferable within the meaning of Sec. 1.83-3(d); and
    (2) Do not have a readily ascertainable fair market value as defined 
in Sec. 1.83-7(b) on the measurement date;
    (B) Exceptions. (1) Paragraph (d)(2)(v)(A) of this section does not 
apply to options issued or transferred with a principal purpose of 
avoiding the application of section 1504 and this section; and
    (2) Paragraph (d)(2)(v)(A) of this section ceases to apply to 
options that become transferable;
    (vi) Options granted in connection with a loan. Options granted in 
connection with a loan if the lender is actively and regularly engaged 
in the business of lending and the options are issued in connection with 
a loan to the issuing corporation that is commercially reasonable. This 
paragraph (d)(2)(vi) continues to apply if the option is transferred 
with the loan (or if a portion of the option is transferred with a 
corresponding portion of the loan). However, if the option is 
transferred without a corresponding portion of the loan, this paragraph 
(d)(2)(vi) ceases to apply;
    (vii) Options created pursuant to a title 11 or similar case. 
Options created by the solicitation or receipt of acceptances to a plan 
of reorganization in a title 11 or similar case (within the meaning of 
section 368(a)(3)(A)), the option created by the confirmation of the

[[Page 565]]

plan, and any option created under the plan prior to the time the plan 
becomes effective;
    (viii) Convertible preferred stock. Convertible preferred stock, 
provided the terms of the conversion feature do not permit or require 
the tender of any consideration other than the stock being converted; 
and
    (ix) Other enumerated instruments. Any other instruments specified 
by the Internal Revenue Service in regulations, a revenue ruling, or 
revenue procedure. See Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter.
    (e) Elimination of federal income tax liability. For purposes of 
this section, the elimination of federal income tax liability includes 
the elimination or deferral of federal income tax liability. In 
determining whether there is an elimination of federal income tax 
liability, the tax consequences to all involved parties are considered. 
Examples of elimination of federal income tax liability include the use 
of a loss or deduction that would not otherwise be utilized, the 
acceleration of a loss or deduction to a year earlier than the year in 
which the loss or deduction would otherwise be utilized, the deferral of 
gain or income to a year later than the year in which the gain or income 
would otherwise be reported, and the acceleration of gain or income to a 
year earlier than the year in which the gain or income would otherwise 
be reported, if such gain or income is offset by a net operating loss or 
net capital loss that would otherwise expire unused. The elimination of 
federal income tax liability does not include the deferral of gain with 
respect to the stock subject to the option that would be recognized if 
such stock were sold on a measurement date.
    (f) Substantial amount of federal income tax liability. The 
determination of what constitutes a substantial amount of federal income 
tax liability is based on all the facts and circumstances, including the 
absolute amount of the elimination, the amount of the elimination 
relative to overall tax liability, and the timing of items of income and 
deductions, taking into account present value concepts.
    (g) Reasonable certainty of exercise--(1) Generally. The 
determination of whether, as of a measurement date, an option is 
reasonably certain to be exercised is based on all the facts and 
circumstances, including:
    (i) Purchase price. The purchase price of the option in absolute 
terms and in relation to the fair market value of the stock or the 
exercise price of the option;
    (ii) In-the-money option. Whether and to what extent the option is 
in-the-money on the measurement date;
    (iii) Not in-the-money option. If the option is not in-the-money on 
the measurement date, the amount or percentage by which the exercise 
price of the option is greater than (or in the case of an option to sell 
stock, is less than) the fair market value of the underlying stock;
    (iv) Exercise price. Whether the exercise price of the option is 
fixed or fluctuates depending on the earnings, value, or other 
indication of economic performance of the issuing corporation;
    (v) Time of exercise. The time at which, or the period of time 
during which, the option can be exercised;
    (vi) Related or sequential options. Whether the option is one in a 
series of related or sequential options;
    (vii) Stockholder rights. The existence of an arrangement (either 
within the option agreement or in a related agreement) that, directly or 
indirectly, affords managerial or economic rights in the issuing 
corporation that ordinarily would be afforded to owners of the issuing 
corporation's stock (e.g., voting rights, dividend rights, or rights to 
proceeds on liquidation) to the person who would acquire the stock upon 
exercise of the option or a person related to such person. For this 
purpose, managerial or economic rights in the issuing corporation 
possessed because of actual stock ownership in the issuing corporation 
are not taken into account;
    (viii) Restrictive covenants. The existence of restrictive covenants 
or similar arrangements (either within the option agreement or in a 
related agreement) that, directly or indirectly, prevent or limit the 
ability of the issuing corporation to undertake certain activities while 
the option is outstanding (e.g., covenants limiting the payment of 
dividends or borrowing of funds);

[[Page 566]]

    (ix) Intention to alter value. Whether it was intended that through 
a change in the capital structure of the issuing corporation or a 
transfer of assets to or from the issuing corporation (other than 
regular, ordinary dividends) or by any other means, the fair market 
value of the stock of the issuing corporation would be altered for a 
principal purpose of increasing the likelihood that the option would be 
exercised; and
    (x) Contingencies. Any contingency (other than the mere passage of 
time) to which the exercise of the option is subject (e.g., a public 
offering of the issuing corporation's stock or reaching a certain level 
of earnings).
    (2) Cash settlement options, phantom stock, stock appreciation 
rights, or similar interests. A cash settlement option, phantom stock, 
stock appreciation right, or similar interest is treated as reasonably 
certain to be exercised if it is reasonably certain that the option will 
have value at some time during the period in which the option may be 
exercised.
    (3) Safe harbors--(i) Options to acquire stock. Except as provided 
in paragraph (g)(3)(iv) of this section, an option to acquire stock is 
not considered reasonably certain, as of a measurement date, to be 
exercised if--
    (A) The option may be exercised no more than 24 months after the 
measurement date and the exercise price is equal to or greater than 90 
percent of the fair market value of the underlying stock on the 
measurement date; or
    (B) The terms of the option provide that the exercise price of the 
option is equal to or greater than the fair market value of the 
underlying stock on the exercise date.
    (ii) Options to sell stock. Except as provided in paragraph 
(g)(3)(iv) of this section, an option to sell stock is not considered 
reasonably certain, as of a measurement date, to be exercised if--
    (A) The option may be exercised no more than 24 months after the 
measurement date and the exercise price is equal to or less than 110 
percent of the fair market value of the underlying stock on the 
measurement date; or
    (B) The terms of the option provide that the exercise price of the 
option is equal to or less than the fair market value of the underlying 
stock on the exercise date.
    (iii) Options exercisable at fair market value. For purposes of 
paragraphs (g)(3)(i)(B) and (g)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, an option 
whose exercise price is determined by a formula is considered to have an 
exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on 
the exercise date if the formula is agreed upon by the parties when the 
option is issued in a bona fide attempt to arrive at fair market value 
on the exercise date and is to be applied based upon the facts in 
existence on the exercise date.
    (iv) Exceptions. The safe harbors of this paragraph (g)(3) do not 
apply if--
    (A) An arrangement exists that provides the holder or a related 
party with stockholder rights described in paragraph (g)(1)(vii) of this 
section (except for rights arising upon a default under the option or a 
related agreement);
    (B) It is intended that through a change in the capital structure of 
the issuing corporation or a transfer of assets to or from the issuing 
corporation (other than regular, ordinary dividends) or by any other 
means, the fair market value of the stock of the issuing corporation 
will be altered for a principal purpose of increasing the likelihood 
that the option will be exercised; or
    (C) The option is one in a series of related or sequential options, 
unless all such options satisfy paragraph (g)(3) (i) or (ii) of this 
section.
    (v) Failure to satisfy safe harbor. Failure of an option to satisfy 
one of the safe harbors of this paragraph (g)(3) does not affect the 
determination of whether an option is treated as reasonably certain to 
be exercised.
    (h) Examples. The provisions of this section may be illustrated by 
the following examples. These examples assume that the measurement dates 
set forth in the examples are the only measurement dates that have taken 
place or will take place.

    Example 1. (i) P is the common parent of a consolidated group, 
consisting of P, S, and T. P owns all 100 shares of S's only class of 
stock, which is voting common stock. P also owns all the stock of T. On 
June 30, 1992, when the fair market value of the S stock is $40 per 
share, P sells to U, an unrelated corporation, an option to acquire 40 
shares of

[[Page 567]]

the S stock that P owns at an exercise price of $30 per share, 
exercisable at any time within 3 years after the granting of the option. 
P and T have had substantial losses for 5 consecutive years while S has 
had substantial income during the same period. Because P, S, and T have 
been filing consolidated returns, P and T have been able to use all of 
their losses to offset S's income. It is anticipated that P, S, and T 
will continue their earnings histories for several more years. On July 
31, 1992, S declares and pays a dividend of $1 per share to P.
    (ii) If P, S, and T continue to file consolidated returns after June 
30, 1992, it could reasonably be anticipated that P, S, and T would 
eliminate a substantial amount of federal income tax liability by using 
P's and T's future losses to offset S's income in consolidated returns. 
Furthermore, based on the difference between the exercise price of the 
option and the fair market value of the S stock, it is reasonably 
certain, on June 30, 1992, a measurement date, that the option will be 
exercised. Therefore, the option held by U is treated as exercised. As a 
result, for purposes of determining whether P and S are affiliated, P is 
treated as owning only 60 percent of the value of outstanding shares of 
S stock and U is treated as owning the remaining 40 percent. P is still 
treated as owning 100 percent of the voting power. Because members of 
the P group are no longer treated as owning stock possessing 80 percent 
of the total value of the S stock as of June 30, 1992, S is no longer a 
member of the P group. Additionally, P is not entitled to a 100 percent 
dividends received deduction under section 243(a)(3) because P and S are 
also treated as not affiliated for purposes of section 243. P is only 
entitled to an 80 percent dividends received deduction under section 
243(c).
    Example 2. (i) The facts are the same as in Example 1 except that 
rather than P issuing an option to acquire 40 shares of S stock to U on 
June 30, 1992, P, pursuant to a plan, issues an option to U1 on July 1, 
1992, to acquire 20 shares of S stock, and issues an option to U2 on 
July 2, 1992, to acquire 20 shares of S stock.
    (ii) Because the options issued to U1 and U2 were issued pursuant to 
a plan, July 2, 1992, constitutes a measurement data for both options. 
Therefore, both options are aggregated in determining whether the 
issuance of the options, rather than the sale of the S stock, would 
result in the elimination of a substantial amount of federal income tax 
liability. Accordingly, as in Example 1, because the continued 
affiliation of P, S, and T could reasonably be anticipated to result in 
the elimination of a substantial amount of federal income tax liability 
and the options are reasonably certain to be exercised, the options are 
treated as exercised for purposes of determining whether P and S are 
affiliated, and P and S are no longer affiliated as of July 2, 1992.
    Example 3. (i) The facts are the same as in Example 1 except that 
the option gives U the right to acquire all 100 shares of the S stock, 
and U is the common parent of a consolidated group. The U group has had 
substantial losses for 5 consecutive years and it is anticipated that 
the U group will continue its earnings history for several more years.
    (ii) If P sold the S stock, in lieu of the option, to U, S would 
become a member of the U group. Because the U group files consolidated 
returns, if P sold the S stock to U, U would be able to use its future 
losses to offset future income of S. When viewing the transaction from 
the effect on all parties, the sale of the option, in lieu of the 
underlying S stock, does not result in the elimination of federal income 
tax liability because S's income would be offset by the losses of 
members of either the P or U group. Accordingly, the option is 
disregarded and S remains a member of the P group.
    Example 4. (i) P is the common parent of a consolidated group, 
consisting of P and S. P owns 90 of the 100 outstanding shares of S's 
only class of stock, which is voting common stock, and U, an unrelated 
corporation, owns the remaining 10 shares. On August 31, 1992, when the 
fair market value of the S stock is $100 per share, P sells a call 
option to U that entitles U to purchase 20 shares of S stock from P, at 
any time before August 31, 1993, at an exercise price of $115 per share. 
The call option does not provide U with any voting rights, dividend 
rights, or any other managerial or economic rights ordinarily afforded 
to owners of the S stock. There is no intention on August 31, 1992, to 
alter the value of S to increase the likelihood of the exercise of the 
call option.
    (ii) Because the exercise price of the call option is equal to or 
greater than 90 percent of the fair market value of the S stock on 
August 31, 1992, a measurement date, the option may be exercised no more 
than 24 months after the measurement date, and none of the items 
described in paragraph (g)(3)(iv) of this section that preclude 
application of the safe harbor are present, the safe harbor of paragraph 
(g)(3)(i) of this section applies and the call option is treated as if 
it is not reasonably certain to be exercised. Therefore, regardless of 
whether the continued affiliation of P and S would result in the 
elimination of a substantial amount of federal income tax liability, the 
call option is disregarded in determining whether S remains a member of 
the P group.
    Example 5. (i) The facts are the same as in Example 4 except that 
the call option gives U the right to vote similar to that of a 
shareholder.
    (ii) Under paragraph (g)(3)(iv) of this section, the safe harbor of 
paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section does not apply because the call

[[Page 568]]

option entitles U to voting rights equivalent to that of a shareholder. 
Accordingly, all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the sale of 
the call option must be taken into consideration in determining whether 
it is reasonably certain that the call option will be exercised.
    Example 6. (i) In 1992, two unrelated corporations, X and Y, decide 
to engage jointly in a new business venture. To accomplish this purpose, 
X organizes a new corporation, S, on September 30, 1992. X acquires 100 
shares of the voting common stock of S, which are the only shares of S 
stock outstanding. Y acquires a debenture of S which is convertible, on 
September 30, 1995, into 100 shares of S common stock. If the conversion 
right is not exercised, X will have the right, on September 30, 1995, to 
put 50 shares of its S stock to Y in exchange for 50 percent of the 
debenture held by Y. The likelihood of the success of the venture is 
uncertain. It is anticipated that S will generate substantial losses in 
its early years of operation. X expects to have substantial taxable 
income during the three years following the organization of S.
    (ii) Under the terms of this arrangement, it is reasonably certain 
on September 30, 1992, a measurement date, that on September 30, 1995, 
either through Y's exercise of its conversion right or X's right to put 
S stock to Y, that Y will own 50 percent of the S stock. Additionally, 
it could reasonably be anticipated, on September 30, 1992, a measurement 
date, that the affiliation of X and S would result in the elimination of 
a substantial amount of federal income tax liability. Accordingly, for 
purposes of determining whether X and S are affiliated, X is treated as 
owning only 50 percent of the value of the S stock as of September 30, 
1992, a measurement date, and S is not a member of the X affiliated 
group.
    Example 7. (i) The facts are the same as in Example 6 except that 
rather than acquiring 100 percent of the S stock and the right to put S 
stock to Y, X acquires only 80 percent of the S stock, while S, rather 
than acquiring a convertible debenture, acquires 20 percent of the S 
stock, and an option to acquire an additional 30 percent of the S stock. 
The terms of the option are such that the option will only be exercised 
if the new business venture succeeds.
    (ii) In contrast to Example 6, because of the true business risks 
involved in the start-up of S and whether the business venture will 
ultimately succeed, along with the fact that X does not have an option 
to put S stock to Y, it is not reasonably certain on September 30, 1992, 
a measurement date, that the option will be exercised and that X will 
only own 50 percent of the S stock on September 30, 1995. Accordingly, 
the option is disregarded in determining whether S is a member of the X 
group.

    (i) Effective date. This section applies, generally, to options with 
a measurement date on or after February 28, 1992. This section does not 
apply to options issued prior to February 28, 1992, which have a 
measurement date on or after February 28, 1992, if the measurement date 
for the option occurs solely because of an adjustment in the terms of 
the option pursuant to the terms of the option as it existed on February 
28, 1992. Paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section applies to stock 
outstanding on or after February 28, 1992.

  Regulations Applicable for Tax Years for Which a Return Is Due on or 
                         Before August 11, 1999


<R05>
Sec. 1.1502-9A  Application of overall foreign loss recapture rules 
to corporations filing consolidated returns due on or before August 11, 1999.

    (a) Scope--(1) Effective date. This section applies only to 
consolidated return years for which the due date of the income tax 
return (without extensions) is on or before August 11, 1999.
    (2) In general. Affiliated group of corporations filing a 
consolidated return sustains an overall foreign loss (a consolidated 
overall foreign loss) in any taxable year in which its gross income from 
sources without the United States subject to a separate limitation (as 
defined in Sec. 1.904(f)-1(c)(2)) is exceeded by the sum of the 
deductions properly allocated and apportioned thereto. However, for 
taxable years prior to 1983, affiliated groups may have determined their 
overall foreign losses for income subject to the passive interest 
limitation, DISC dividend limitation, and general limitation on a 
combined basis in accordance with the rules in Sec. 1.904(f)-1(c)(1). 
The rules contained in Sec. Sec. 1.904(f)-1 through 1.904(f)-6 are 
applicable to affiliated groups filing consolidated returns. This 
section provides special rules for applying those sections to such 
groups. Paragraph (b) provides rules for additions and subtractions of a 
portion of overall foreign losses to and from consolidated overall 
foreign loss accounts. Paragraph (c) requires that separate notional 
overall

[[Page 569]]

foreign loss accounts be kept for each member of the group that 
contributes to a consolidated overall foreign loss account and provides 
for allocation of a portion of the group's overall foreign loss account 
to a member when the member leaves the group prior to recapture of the 
entire amount of the loss account. These rules are similar to the rules 
provided in Sec. 1.1502-21(b)(2) (or Sec. 1.1502-79A, as appropriate) 
concerning the apportionment of consolidated net operating losses to a 
member who leaves the group. However, the rules differ somewhat because 
the absorption rule of Sec. 1.1502-21(b)(1) (or Sec. 1.1502-79A, as 
appropriate) is applied year-by-year, consistently with the sequence 
rules of section 172(b), and recapture of overall foreign losses is 
based on overall foreign loss accounts that may consist of losses in 
more than one year. Paragraph (d) provides rules for recapture of 
amounts in consolidated overall foreign loss accounts. Paragraph (e) 
provides special rules pertaining to section 904(f)(3) dispositions 
between members of a group. Paragraphs (b), (c), and (e) also contain 
special rules that apply to overall foreign losses that arise in 
separate return limitation years; the principles therein also apply to 
overall foreign losses when there has been a consolidated return change 
of ownership (as defined in Sec. 1.1502-1(g)). See Sec. 1.1502-
9T(b)(1)(v) for the rule that ends the separate return limitation year 
limitation for consolidated return years for which the due date of the 
income tax return (without extensions) is after March 13, 1998, and 
Sec. 1.1502-9T(b)(1)(vi) for an election to continue the separate 
return limitation year limitation for consolidated return years 
beginning before January 1, 1998. See also Sec. 1.1502-3(d)(4) for an 
optional effective date rule (generally making the rules of paragraphs 
(b)(1)(iii) and (iv) of this section inapplicable for a consolidated 
return year beginning after December 31, 1996, if the due date of the 
income tax return (without extensions) for such year is on or before 
March 13, 1998).
    (b) Consolidated overall foreign loss accounts. Any group that 
sustains an overall foreign loss (or acquires a member with a balance in 
an overall foreign loss account) must establish a consolidated overall 
foreign loss account for such loss, and amounts shall be added to and 
subtracted from such account as provided in Sec. Sec. 1.904(f)-1 
through 1.904(f)-6 and this section.
    (1) Additions to the consolidated overall foreign loss accounts--(i) 
Consolidated overall foreign losses. Any consolidated overall foreign 
loss shall be added to the applicable consolidated overall foreign loss 
account for such separate limitation, to the extent that the overall 
foreign loss has reduced United States source income, in accordance with 
the rules of Sec. Sec. 1.904(f)-1 and 1.904(f)-3.
    (ii) Overall foreign losses from separate return years. If a 
corporation joins in the filing of a consolidated return in a taxable 
year in which such corporation has a balance in an overall foreign loss 
account from a prior separate return year that is not a separate return 
limitation year, such balance shall be added to the applicable 
consolidated overall foreign loss account in such year and treated as a 
consolidated overall foreign loss incurred in the previous year (and 
shall therefore be subject to recapture, in accordance with paragraph 
(d) of this section, beginning in the same year in which it is added to 
the consolidated overall foreign loss account).
    (iii) Overall foreign losses from separate return limitation years. 
If a corporation joins in the filing of a consolidated return in a 
taxable year in which such corporation has a balance in an overall 
foreign loss account from a prior separate return limitation year, such 
balance shall be added to the applicable consolidated overall foreign 
loss account in such consolidated return year to the extent of the 
lesser of the balance in the overall foreign loss account from the 
separate return limitation year or 50 percent (or such larger percentage 
as the taxpayer may elect) of the difference between the consolidated 
foreign source taxable income subject to the same separate limitation 
(computed in accordance with Sec. Sec. 1.904(f)-2(b) and 1.1502-
4(d)(1)) minus such consolidated foreign source taxable income 
recomputed by excluding the items of income and deduction of such 
corporation (but not less than zero). The amount added to a consolidated 
overall foreign loss account in any taxable

[[Page 570]]

year under this paragraph (b)(1)(iii) shall be treated as a consolidated 
overall foreign loss in the previous year (and shall therefore be 
subject to recapture, in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, 
beginning in the same year in which it is added to the consolidated 
overall foreign loss account).
    (iv) Overall foreign losses that are part of a net operating loss or 
net capital loss carried over from a separate return limitation year. 
Overall foreign losses that are part of a net operating loss or net 
capital loss carryover from a separate return limitation year of a 
member that is absorbed in a consolidated return year shall be treated 
as though they were added to an overall foreign loss account in a 
separate return limitation year of such member and will be subject to 
the limitation on recapture of SRLY losses contained in paragraph 
(b)(1)(iii) of this section. See paragraph (c)(2) of this section for 
rules regarding the addition of such losses to the applicable overall 
foreign loss account of such member.
    (v) Special effective date for SRLY limitation. Except as provided 
in paragraph (b)(1)(vi) of this section, paragraphs (b)(1)(iii) and (iv) 
of this section apply only to consolidated return years for which the 
due date of the income tax return (without extensions) is on or before 
March 13, 1998. For consolidated return years for which the due date of 
the income tax return (without extensions) is after March 13, 1998, the 
rules of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section shall apply to overall 
foreign losses from separate return years that are separate return 
limitation years. For purposes of applying paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this 
section in such years, the group treats a member with a balance in an 
overall foreign loss account from a separate return limitation year on 
the first day of the first consolidated return year for which the due 
date of the income tax return (without extensions) is after March 13, 
1998, as a corporation joining the group on such first day. An overall 
foreign loss that is part of a net operating loss or net capital loss 
carryover from a separate return limitation year of a member that is 
absorbed in a consolidated return year for which the due date of the 
income tax return (without extensions) is after March 13, 1998, shall be 
added to the appropriate consolidated overall foreign loss account in 
the year that it is absorbed. For consolidated return years for which 
the due date of the income tax return (without extensions) is after 
March 13, 1998, similar principles apply to overall foreign losses when 
there has been a consolidated return change of ownership (regardless of 
when the change of ownership occurred). See also Sec. 1.1502-3(d)(4) 
for an optional effective date rule (generally making this paragraph 
(b)(1)(v) applicable to a consolidated return year beginning after 
December 31, 1996, if the due date of the income tax return (without 
extensions) for such year is on or before March 13, 1998).
    (vi) Election to defer application of special effective date. A 
consolidated group may elect not to apply paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this 
section to consolidated return years beginning before January 1, 1998. 
To make this election, a consolidated group must write ``Election 
Pursuant to Notice 98-40'' across the top of page 1 of an original or 
amended tax return for each consolidated return year subject to the 
election. For the first consolidated return year to which the overall 
foreign loss provisions of paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section apply 
(i.e., the first year beginning on or after January 1, 1998), such 
consolidated group must write ``Notice 98-40 Election in Effect in Prior 
Years'' across the top of page 1 of the consolidated tax return for that 
year. For purposes of applying paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section with 
respect to such year, any member with a balance in an overall foreign 
loss account from a separate return limitation year on the first day of 
such year shall be treated as joining the group on such first day.
    (2) Reductions of the consolidated overall foreign loss accounts--
(i) Amounts allocated to members leaving the group. When a member leaves 
the group, each applicable consolidated overall foreign loss account 
shall be reduced by the amount allocated from such account to such 
member in accordance with paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section.
    (ii) Amounts recaptured. A consolidated overall foreign loss account 
shall

[[Page 571]]

be reduced by the amount of any overall foreign loss under the same 
separate limitation that is recaptured from consolidated income in 
accordance with Sec. 1.904(f)-2.
    (c) Allocation of overall foreign losses among members of an 
affiliated group--(1) Notional overall foreign loss accounts. Separate 
notional overall foreign loss accounts shall be established for each 
member of a group that contributes to a consolidated overall foreign 
loss account. Additions to and reductions of such notional accounts 
shall be made when additions or reductions are made to consolidated 
overall foreign loss accounts in accordance with paragraph (b) of this 
section and Sec. 1.904(f)-1.
    (i) Additions to notional accounts--(A) Consolidated overall foreign 
losses. When a consolidated overall foreign loss is added to a 
consolidated overall foreign loss account, each member shall add its pro 
rata share of the amount of such loss to the member's notional overall 
foreign loss account. A member's pro rata share of a consolidated 
overall foreign loss for any taxable year is determined by multiplying 
the consolidated loss by a fraction.The numerator of this fraction is 
the amount by which the member's separate gross income for the taxable 
year from sources without the United States subject to the applicable 
separate limitation is exceeded by the sum of the deductions properly 
allocated and apportioned thereto (including such member's share of any 
consolidated net operating loss deduction and consolidated net capital 
loss carryovers and carrybacks to the taxable year), for each member 
with such deductions in excess of such income. The denominator of this 
fraction is the sum of the numerators of this fraction for all such 
members of the group.
    (B) Overall foreign losses from separate return years and separate 
return limitation years. When an amount from a member's overall foreign 
loss account from a separate return year or separate return limitation 
year is added to a consolidated overall foreign loss account in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(1) (ii) or (iii) of this section, such 
amount shall also be added to that member's notional overall foreign 
loss account for such separate limitation.
    (ii) Reductions of notional accounts. When a consolidated overall 
foreign loss account is reduced by recapture, in accordance with 
paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, each member of the group shall 
reduce its notional overall foreign loss account for that separate 
limitation by its pro rata share of the amount by which the consolidated 
overall foreign loss account is reduced. A member's pro rata share of 
the amount by which a consolidated overall foreign loss account is 
reduced and determined by multiplying the amount recaptured by a 
fraction, the numerator of which is the amount in such member's notional 
account under such separate limitation, and the denominator of which is 
the amount in the consolidated overall foreign loss account under such 
separate limitation before reduction for the amount recaptured for that 
taxable year.
    (2) Overall foreign losses that are part of a net operating loss or 
net capital loss from a separate return limitation year. An overall 
foreign loss that is part of a net operating loss or net capital loss 
carryover from a separate return limitation year of a member that is 
absorbed in a consolidated return year shall be treated as an overall 
foreign loss of such member (rather than the group) and shall be added 
to such member's separate overall foreign loss account to the extent it 
reduces United States source income, in accordance with Sec. 1.904(f)-
1(d)(5). Such overall foreign losses shall be added to the appropriate 
consolidated overall foreign loss account in later years in accordance 
with paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (3) Allocation of a portion of overall foreign loss accounts to a 
member leaving the group--(i) Consolidated overall foreign losses. When 
a corporation ceases to be a member of an affiliated group filing 
consolidated returns, a portion of the balance in each applicable 
consolidated overall foreign loss account shall be allocated to such 
corporation. The amount allocated to such corporation shall be equal to 
the amount, if any, in such member's notional overall foreign loss 
account under the same separate limitation.

[[Page 572]]

    (ii) Overall foreign losses from separate return limitation years. 
When a corporation ceases to be a member of an affiliated group filing 
consolidated returns, it shall take with it the remaining portion of 
each separate overall foreign loss account for overall foreign losses 
from separate return limitation years (including amounts added to such 
accounts under paragraph (c)(2) of this section).
    (d) Recapture of consolidated overall foreign losses. The amount in 
any consolidated overall foreign loss account shall be recaptured under 
Sec. Sec. 1.904(f)-1 through 1.904(f)-6 by recharacterizing 
consolidated foreign source taxable income subject to the separate 
limitation under which the loss arose as United States source taxable 
income. For purposes of recapture, consolidated foreign source taxable 
income subject to the separate limitation under which the loss arose 
shall be determined in accordance with Sec. Sec. 1.904(f)-2 and 1.1502-
4. Amounts in a member's excess loss account that are included in income 
under Sec. 1.1502-19 shall be subject to recapture to the extent that 
they are included in consolidated foreign source taxable income subject 
to the separate limitation under which the loss arose.
    (e) Dispositions of property between members of the same affiliated 
group during a consolidated return year--(1) In general. Except as 
provided in paragraph (2) with respect to overall foreign losses of a 
selling member from a separate return limitation year, the rules of 
Sec. 1.1502-13 with respect to intercompany transactions will apply to 
dispositions of property to which section 904(f)(3)(A) applies.
    (2) Recapture of overall foreign loss from a separate return 
limitation year. Paragraph (1) will not apply and gain will be 
recognized to the extent that the selling member has a balance in its 
overall foreign loss account from a separate return limitation year 
unless the selling member adds the entire amount of its overall foreign 
loss account from separate return limitation years to the applicable 
consolidated overall foreign loss account and treats such amount as an 
overall foreign loss incurred in the previous year. Such loss shall be 
subject to recapture, in accordance with paragraph (d) of Sec. 1.1502-
9, beginning in the same year in which it is added to the consolidated 
overall foreign loss account.
    (f) Illustrations. The provisions of this section are illustrated by 
the following examples. All foreign source income or loss in these 
examples is subject to the general limitation.

    Example (1). A, B, and C are the members of an affiliated group of 
corporations (as defined in section 1504), and all use the calendar year 
as their taxable year. For 1983, A, B, and C file a consolidated return. 
ABC has United States source income of $1,000 and foreign source losses 
(overall foreign loss) of $400. In accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(i) 
of this section, ABC adds $400 to its consolidated overall foreign loss 
account at the end of 1983. For 1983, the separate foreign source 
taxable income (or loss) of A is $400, of B is ($200), and of C is 
($600). Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, B and C must establish 
separate notional overall foreign loss accounts. Under paragraph 
(c)(1)(i)(A) of this section, the amount added to each notional account 
is the pro rata share of the consolidated overall foreign loss of each 
member contributing to such loss. The pro rata share is determined by 
multiplying the consolidated loss by the member's proportionate share of 
the total foreign source losses of all members having such losses. B's 
foreign source loss if $200 and C's foreign source loss is $600, 
totaling $800. B must add $400x200/800, or $100, to its notional overall 
foreign loss account. C must add $400x600/800, or $300, to its notional 
overall foreign loss account.
    Example (2). The facts are the same as in example (1). In 1984, ABC 
has consolidated foreign source taxable income of $200. Under paragraph 
(d) of this section and Sec. 1.904(f)-2, ABC is required to recapture 
$100 of the amount in its consolidated overall foreign loss account, 
which reduces that account by $100 under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this 
section. In accordance with paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, B 
reduces its notional account by $100x100/400, or $25, and C reduces it 
notional account by $100x300/400, or $75. At the end of 1984 ABC has 
$300 in its consolidated overall foreign loss account, B has $75 in its 
notional account, and C has $225 in its notional account.
    Example (3). D and E are members of an affiliated group and file 
separate returns using the calendar year as their taxable year for 1980. 
In 1980, D has an overall foreign loss of $200, which it adds to its 
overall foreign loss account, and E has no overall foreign losses. For 
1981, D and E file a consolidated return, and DE must establish a 
consolidated overall foreign loss account, to which D's overall foreign 
loss from 1980 is added under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. D 
also adds the same amount $200 to its notional account

[[Page 573]]

under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B) of this section. In 1981, DE has 
consolidated foreign source taxable income of $300. Since the amount 
added to the consolidated overall foreign loss account in 1981 is 
treated as a consolidated overall foreign loss from 1980, DE must 
recapture $150 in 1981 under paragraph (d) of this section and Sec. 
1.904(f)-2. DE's consolidated overall foreign loss account is reduced by 
$150 under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, and D's notional 
account is reduced by $150 under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, 
leaving balances of $50 in each of those accounts at the end of 1981.
    Example (4). F and G are not members of an affiliated group in 1980, 
and G has an overall foreign loss of $200, which it adds to its overall 
foreign loss account. F has no overall foreign loss. On January 1, 1981, 
F acquires G, and FG files a consolidated return for the calendar year 
1981. In 1981, F has no foreign source taxable income or loss, and G has 
$100 of foreign source taxable income. FG's consolidated foreign source 
taxable income, $100, minus such income without G's items of income and 
deduction, $0, is $100. Therefore 50% of that amount, $50, of G's 
overall foreign loss from its 1980 separate return limitation year is 
added to FG's consolidated overall foreign loss account under paragraph 
(b)(1)(iii) of this section, and the same amount is added to G's 
notional account under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B) of this section. In 
accordance with paragraph (d) of this section and Sec. 1.904(f)-2, FG 
must recapture the $50 balance in its consolidated overall foreign loss 
account in 1981 because the amount added from G's separate return 
limitation year is treated as a 1980 consolidated overall foreign loss. 
At the end of 1981, FG has a balance of $0 in its consolidated overall 
foreign loss account, G has $0 in its notional account, and G also has 
$150 remaining from its 1980 overall foreign loss that has not yet been 
added to the consolidated overall foreign loss account.
    On January 1, 1982, F sells G and G leaves the affiliated group. 
Under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, G takes with it the balance 
in its overall foreign loss account from 1980 (its prior separate return 
limitation year) that has not been added to the consolidated account. G 
has $150 of overall foreign loss in its overall foreign loss account. 
Because the amount in the consolidated overall foreign loss account is 
zero, no amount from that account is allocated to G.
    Example (5). (i) In 1982 corporation H has United States source 
income of $300 and foreign source losses of $500, resulting in a net 
operating loss of $200 and a balance in H's overall foreign loss account 
at the end of 1982 of $300.
    (ii) On January 1, 1983, H is acquired by J, and for the calendar 
year 1983 JH files a consolidated return. JH has consolidated taxable 
income of $700 in 1983, including a consolidated net operating loss 
deduction of $100. This net operating loss deduction is $100 of H's $200 
net operating loss from 1982 (a separate return limitation year), which 
is limited by Sec. 1.1502-21A(c). For 1983, H has separate taxable 
income of $100, comprised of $100 of United States source taxable income 
and zero foreign source taxable income, and J has separate taxable 
income of $700, comprised of $700 of United States source taxable income 
and zero foreign source taxable income. Under paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section, H adds $100 to its separate overall foreign loss account, since 
that amount of its net operating loss has reduced United States source 
income. H has $400 in its separate overall foreign loss account at the 
end of 1983, none of which has been added to a consolidated overall 
foreign loss account.
    (iii) In 1984, H has separate taxable income of $400, comprised of 
$100 of United States source taxable income and $300 of foreign source 
taxable income. J has separate taxable income of $900, comprised of $700 
of United States source taxable income and $200 of foreign source 
taxable income. JH has consolidated taxable income of $1200, which 
includes $100 of consolidated net operating loss deduction from H's 1982 
net operating loss. Since this net operating loss deduction is allocated 
to foreign source income, it does not reduce United States source income 
and will not be added to an overall foreign loss account. Under 
paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, $100, from H's overall foreign 
loss is added to the consolidated overall foreign loss account computed 
as follows:

Consolidated foreign source taxable income.................         $400
Consolidated foreign source taxable income recomputed by            -200
 excluding H's foreign source income and deduction.........
                                                            ------------
   $200....................................................
  x 50%....................................................         $100
Amount from H's separate return limitation year overall             $100
 foreign loss account added to the consolidated overall
 foreign loss account......................................
 


This amount is subject to recapture beginning in the same taxable year, 
as it is treated as a consolidated overall foreign loss incurred in a 
previous year. Therefore, under paragraph (d) of this section and Sec. 
1.904(f)-2 JH also recaptures this $100, reducing the consolidated 
overall foreign loss account to $0. H has $300 remaining in its separate 
overall foreign loss account at the end of 1984.
    (iv) In 1985, H has separate taxable income of $400, comprised of 
$100 of United States source taxable income and $300 of foreign source 
taxable income. J has separate taxable income of $300 comprised of $600 
of United States source taxable income and $300

[[Page 574]]

of foreign source losses. JH has consolidated taxable income of $700, 
all of which is United States source. Under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of 
this section an additional $150 from H's separate overall foreign loss 
is added to the consolidated overall foreign loss account, computed as 
follows:

Consolidated foreign source taxable income.................           $0
Consolidated foreign source taxable income recomputed by          -(300)
 excluding H's foreign source income and deductions........
                                                            ------------
   300.....................................................
  x 50%....................................................         $150
Amount from H's separate return limitation year overall             $150
 foreign loss account added to the consolidated overall
 foreign loss account......................................
 

Thus, an additional $150 of H's separate overall foreign loss is added 
to the consolidated overall foreign loss account, and, under paragraph 
(c)(1)(i)(B) of this section, the same amount is added to J's notional 
account. While this amount is subject to recapture beginning in the same 
taxable year, JH has no consolidated foreign source taxable income in 
1985, so no overall foreign loss is recaptured. H has a remaining 
balance of $150 in its separate return limitation year overall foreign 
loss account and HJ has $150 in its consolidated overall foreign loss 
account.
    Example (6). A, B, and C are members of an affiliated group of 
corporations (as defined in section 1504), and all use the calendar year 
as their taxable year. For 1986, A, B, and C file a consolidated return. 
A has an overall foreign loss account which arose in a separate return 
limitation year. The amount in the overall foreign loss account is 
$2,000. A makes a disposition of all its assets to B on January 1, 1986. 
The gain on the transfer is $1,500, all of which would be recognized 
under section 904(f)(3). However, if A adds the total amount of its 
overall foreign loss from separate return limitation years to ABC's 
consolidated overall foreign loss account, no gain will be recognized on 
the transfer until the intercompany gain is taken into account under 
Sec. 1.1502-13. In the interim, any foreign source gain of the 
purchasing member (or any other member of the consolidated group) may be 
used to recapture on a consolidated basis the amount in ABC's

     Regulations Applicable to Taxable Years Before January 1, 1997


<R05>
Sec. 1.1502-15A  Limitations on the allowance of built-in deductions 
for consolidated return years beginning before January 1, 1997.

    (a) Limitation on built-in deductions--(1) General rule. Built-in 
deductions (as defined in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph) for a 
taxable year shall be subject to the limitation of Sec. 1.1502-21A(c) 
(determined without regard to such deductions and without regard to net 
operating loss carryovers to such year) and the limitation of Sec. 
1.1502-22A(c) (determined without regard to such deductions and without 
regard to capital loss carryovers to such year). If as a result of 
applying such limitations, built-in deductions are not allowable in such 
consolidated return year, such deductions shall be treated as a net 
operating loss or net capital loss (as the case may be) sustained in 
such year and shall be carried to those taxable years (consolidated or 
separate) to which a consolidated net operating loss or a consolidated 
net capital loss could be carried under Sec. Sec. 1.1502-21A, 1.1502-
22A and 1.1502-79A, (or Sec. Sec. 1.1502-21T and 1.1502-22T, as 
appropriate) except that such losses shall be treated as losses subject 
to the limitations contained in Sec. Sec. 1.1502-21T(c) or 1.1502-
22T(c) (or Sec. Sec. 1.1502-21A(c), 1.1502-22A(c), as appropriate), as 
the case may be. Thus, for example, if member X sells a capital asset 
during a consolidated return year at a $1,000 loss and such loss is 
treated as a built-in deduction, then such loss shall be subject to the 
limitation contained in Sec. 1.1502-22(c), which, in general, would 
allow such loss to be offset only against X's own capital gain net 
income (net capital gain for taxable years beginning before January 1, 
1977). Assuming X had no capital gain net income (net capital gain for 
taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) reflected in such year 
(after taking into account its capital losses, other than capital loss 
carryovers and the built-in deduction), such $1,000 loss shall be 
treated as a net capital loss and shall be carried over for 5 years 
under Sec. 1.1502-22, subject to the limitation contained in Sec. 
1.1502-22(c) for consolidated return years.

[[Page 575]]

    (2) Built-in deductions. (i) For purposes of this paragraph, the 
term ``built-in deductions'' for a consolidated return year means those 
deductions or losses of a corporation which are recognized in such year, 
or which are recognized in a separate return year and carried over in 
the form of a net operating or net capital loss to such year, but which 
are economically accrued in a separate return limitation year (as 
defined in Sec. 1.1502-1(f)). Such term does not include deductions or 
losses incurred in rehabilitating such corporation. Thus, for example, 
assume P is the common parent of a group filing consolidated returns on 
the basis of a calendar year and that P purchases all of the stock of S 
on December 31, 1966. Assume further that on December 31, 1966, S owns a 
capital asset with an adjusted basis of $100 and a fair market value of 
$50. If the group files a consolidated return for 1967, and S sells the 
asset for $30, $50 of the $70 loss is treated as a built-in deduction, 
since it was economically accrued in a separate return limitation year. 
If S sells the asset for $80 instead of $30, the $20 loss is treated as 
a built-in deduction. On the other hand, if such asset is a depreciable 
asset and is not sold by S, depreciation deductions attributable to the 
$50 difference between basis and fair market value are treated as built-
in deductions.
    (ii) In determining, for purposes of subdivision (i) of this 
subparagraph, whether a deduction or loss with respect to any asset is 
economically accrued in a separate return limitation year, the term 
``predecessor'' as used in Sec. 1.1502-1(f)(1) shall include any 
transferor of such asset if the basis of the asset in the hands of the 
transferee is determined (in whole or in part) by reference to its basis 
in the hands of such transferor.
    (3) Transitional rule. If the assets which produced the built-in 
deductions were acquired (either directly or by acquiring a new member) 
by the group on or before January 4, 1973, and the separate return 
limitation year in which such deductions were economically accrued ended 
before such date, then at the option of the taxpayer, the provi-sions of 
this paragraph before amendment by T.D. 7246 shall apply, and, in 
addition, if such assets were acquired on or before April 17, 1968, and 
the separate return limitation year in which the built-in deductions 
were economically accrued ended on or before such date, then at the 
option of the taxpayer, the provisions of Sec. 1.1502-31A(b)(9)(as 
contained in the 26 C.F.R. edition revised as of April 1, 1996) shall 
apply in lieu of this paragraph.

    (4) Exceptions. (i) Subparagraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this 
paragraph shall not limit built-in deductions in a taxable year with 
respect to assets acquired (either directly or by acquiring a new 
member) by the group if:

    (a) The group acquired the assets more than 10 years before the 
first day of such taxable year, or

    (b) Immediately before the group acquired the assets, the aggregate 
of the adjusted basis of all assets (other than cash, marketable 
securities, and goodwill) acquired from the transferor or owned by the 
new member did not exceed the fair market value of all such assets by 
more than 15 percent.

    (ii) For purposes of subdivision (i)(b) of this subparagraph, a 
security is not a marketable security if immediately before the group 
acquired the assets:

    (a) The fair market value of the security is less than 95 percent of 
its adjusted basis, or

    (b) The transferor or new member had held the security for at least 
24 months, or

    (c) The security is stock in a corporation at least 50 percent of 
the fair market value of the outstanding stock of which is owned by the 
transferor or new member.

    (b) Effective date. This section applies to any consolidated return 
years to which Sec. 1.1502-21T does not apply. See Sec. 1.1502-21T(g) 
for effective dates of that section.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1502-21A  Consolidated net operating loss deduction generally 
applicable for consolidated return years beginning before January 1, 1997.

    (a) In general. The consolidated net operating loss deduction shall 
be an amount equal to the aggregate of the consolidated net operating 
loss carryovers and carrybacks to the taxable year (as determined under 
paragraph (b) of this section).
    (b) Consolidated net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks--(1) 
In general. The consolidated net operating loss carryovers and 
carrybacks to the taxable year shall consist of any consolidated net 
operating losses (as determined under paragraph (f) of this section) of 
the group, plus any net operating losses sustained by members of the 
group in separate return years, which may be carried over or back to the 
taxable year under the principles of section 172(b). However, such 
consolidated carryovers and carrybacks shall not include any 
consolidated net operating loss apportioned to a corporation for a 
separate return year pursuant to Sec. 1.1502-79A(a), and shall be 
subject to the limitations contained in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of 
this section and to the limitation contained in Sec. 1.1502-15A (or 
Sec. 1.1502-11(c), as appropriate).
    (2) Rules for applying section 172(b)(1)--(i) Regulated 
transportation corporations. For purposes of applying section 
172(b)(1)(C) (relating to net operating losses sustained by regulated 
transportation corporations), in the case of a consolidated net 
operating loss sustained in a taxable year for which a member of the 
group was a regulated transportation corporation (as defined in section 
172(j)(1)), the portion, if any, of such consolidated net operating loss 
which is attributable to such corporation (as determined under this 
paragraph shall be a carryover to the sixth taxable year following the 
loss year only if such corporation is a regulated transportation 
corporation for such sixth year, and shall be a carryover to the seventh 
taxable year following the loss year only if such corporation is a 
regulated transportation corporation for both such sixth and seventh 
years.
    (ii) Trade expansion losses. In the case of a carryback of a 
consolidated net operating loss from a taxable year for which a member 
of the group has been issued a certification under section 317 of the 
Trade Expansion Act of 1962 and with respect to which the requirements 
of section 172(b)(3)(A) have been met, section 172(b)(1)(A)(ii) shall 
apply only to the portion of such consolidated net operating loss 
attributable to such member.
    (iii) Foreign expropriation losses. An election under section 
172(b)(3)(C) (relating to 10-year carryover of portion of net operating 
loss attributable to a foreign expropriation loss) may be made for a 
consolidated return year only if the sum of the foreign expropriation 
losses (as defined in section 172(k)) of the members of the group for 
such year equals or exceeds 50 percent of the consolidated net operating 
loss for such year. If such election is made, the amount which may be 
carried over under section 172(b)(1)(D) is the smaller of (a) the sum of 
such foreign expropriation losses, or (b) the consolidated net operating 
loss.
    (3) Absorption rules. For purposes of determining the amount, if 
any, of a net operating loss (whether consolidated or separate) which 
can be carried to a taxable year (consolidated or separate), the amount 
of such net operating loss which is absorbed in a prior consolidated 
return year under section 172(b)(2) shall be determined by:
    (i) Applying all net operating losses which can be carried to such 
prior year in the order of the taxable years in which such losses were 
sustained, beginning with the taxable year which ends earliest, and
    (ii) Applying all such losses which can be carried to such prior 
year from taxable years ending on the same date on a pro rata basis, 
except that any portion of a net operating loss attributable to a 
foreign expropriation loss to which section 172(b)(1)(D) applies shall 
be applied last.
    (c) Limitation on net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks from 
separate return limitation years--(1) General rule. In the case of a net 
operating loss of a member of the group arising in a separate return 
limitation year (as defined in paragraph (f) of Sec. 1.1502-1) of such

[[Page 577]]

member (and in a separate return limitation year of any predecessor of 
such member), the amount which may be included under paragraph (b) of 
this section (computed without regard to the limitation contained in 
paragraph (d) of this section) in the consolidated net operating loss 
carryovers and carrybacks to a consolidated return year of the group 
shall not exceed the amount determined under subparagraph (2) of this 
paragraph.
    (2) Computation of limitation. The amount referred to in 
subparagraph (1) of this paragraph with respect to a member of the group 
is the excess, if any, of:
    (i) Consolidated taxable income (computed without regard to the 
consolidated net operating loss deduction), minus such consolidated 
taxable income recomputed by excluding the items of income and deduction 
of such member, over
    (ii) The net operating losses attributable to such member which may 
be carried to the consolidated return year arising in taxable years 
ending prior to the particular separate return limitation year.
    (3) Examples. The provisions of this paragraph and paragraphs (a) 
and (b) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

    Example (1). (i) Corporation P formed corporations S and T on 
January 1, 1965. P, S, and T filed separate returns for the calendar 
year 1965, a year for which an election under section 1562 was 
effective. T's return for that year reflected a net operating loss of 
$10,000. The group filed a consolidated return for 1966 reflecting 
consolidated taxable income of $30,000 (computed without regard to the 
consolidated net operating loss deduction). Among the transactions 
occurring during 1966 were the following:
    (a) P sold goods to T deriving deferred profits of $7,000 on such 
sales, $2,000 of which was restored to consolidated taxable income on 
the sale of such goods to outsiders;
    (b) T sold a machine to S deriving a deferred profit of $5,000, 
$1,000 of which was restored to consolidated taxable income as a result 
of S's depreciation deductions;
    (c) T distributed a $3,000 dividend to P; and
    (d) In addition to the transactions described above, T had other 
taxable income of $6,000.
    (ii) The carryover of T's 1965 net operating loss to 1966 is subject 
to the limitation contained in this paragraph, since 1965 was a separate 
return limitation year (an election under section 1562 was effective for 
such year). Thus, only $7,000 of T's $10,000 net operating loss is a 
consolidated net operating loss carryover to 1966, since such carryover 
is limited to consolidated taxable income (computed without regard to 
the consolidated net operating loss deduction), $30,000, minus such 
consolidated taxable income recomputed by excluding the items of income 
and deduction of T, $23,000 (i.e., consolidated taxable income computed 
without regard to the $1,000 restoration of T's deferred gain and T's 
$6,000 of other income). In making such recomputation, no change is made 
in the effect on consolidated taxable income of P's sale to T, or of the 
dividend from T to P.
    Example (2). (i) Corporation P was formed on January 1, 1966. P 
filed separate returns for the calendar years 1966 and 1967 reflecting 
net operating losses of $4,000 and $12,000, respectively. P purchased 
corporation S on March 15, 1967. S was formed on February 1, 1966, and 
filed a separate return for the taxable year ending January 31, 1967. S 
also filed a short period return for the period from February 1 to 
December 31, 1967, and joined with P in filing a consolidated return for 
1968. S sustained net operating losses of $5,000 and $6,000 for its 
taxable years ending January 31, 1967, and December 31, 1967, 
respectively. An election under section 1562 was not effective for P and 
S during the period involved. Consolidated taxable income for 1968 
(computed without regard to the consolidated net operating loss 
deduction) was $16,000; such consolidated taxable income recomputed by 
disregarding the items of income and deduction of S was $9,000.
    (ii) In order of time, the following losses are absorbed in 1968:
    (a) P's $4,000 net operating loss for the calendar year 1966 (such 
loss is not subject to the limitation contained in this paragraph since 
P is the common parent corporation for 1968);
    (b) S's $5,000 net operating loss for the year ended January 31, 
1967. Such loss is subject to the limitation contained in this 
paragraph, since S was not a member of the group on each day of such 
year. However, such loss can be carried over and absorbed in full since 
such limitation is $7,000 (consolidated taxable income computed without 
regard to the consolidated net operating loss deduction, $16,000, minus 
such consolidated taxable income recomputed, $9,000); and
    (c) $6,000 of P's net operating loss and $1,000 of S's net operating 
loss for the taxable years ending December 31, 1967. This is determined 
by applying the losses from such year which can be carried to 1968 (P's 
$12,000 loss and $2,000 of S's $6,000 loss, since such $6,000 loss is 
limited under this paragraph) on a pro rata basis against the amount of 
such losses which can be absorbed in that year, $7,000 (consolidated 
taxable income of $16,000 less the $9,000 of losses absorbed from prior

[[Page 578]]

years). The carryover of S's loss to 1968 is subject to the limitation 
contained in that paragraph, since S was not a member of the group on 
each day of its taxable year ending December 31, 1967. Such loss is 
limited to $2,000, the excess of $7,000 (as determined under (ii)(b)) 
over $5,000 (S's carryover from the year ended January 31, 1967). If a 
consolidated return is filed in 1969, the consolidated net operating 
loss carryovers will consist of P's unabsorbed loss of $6,000 ($12,000 
minus $6,000) from 1967 and, subject to the limitation contained in this 
paragraph, S's unabsorbed loss of $5,000 ($6,000 minus $1,000) from its 
year ended December 31, 1967.

    (d) Limitation on carryovers where there has been a consolidated 
return change of ownership--(1) General rule. If a consolidated return 
change of ownership (as defined in paragraph (g) of Sec. 1.1502-1) 
occurs during the taxable year or an earlier taxable year, the amount 
which may be included under paragraph (b) of this section in the 
consolidated net operating loss carryovers to the taxable year with 
respect to the aggregate of the net operating losses attributable to old 
members of the group (as defined in paragraph (g)(3) of Sec. 1.1502-1) 
arising in taxable years (consolidated or separate) ending on the same 
day and before the taxable year in which the consolidated return change 
of ownership occurred shall not exceed the amount determined under 
subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.
    (2) Computation of limitation. The amount referred to in 
subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall be the excess of:
    (i) The consolidated taxable income for the taxable year (determined 
without regard to the consolidated net operating loss deduction) 
recomputed by including only the items of income and deduction of the 
old members of the group, over
    (ii) The sum of the net operating losses attributable to the old 
members of the group which may be carried to the taxable year arising in 
taxable years ending prior to the particular loss year or years.
    (3) Example. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by 
the following example:

    Example. (i) Corporation P is formed on January 1, 1967, and on the 
same day it forms corporation S. P and S file a consolidated return for 
the calendar year 1967, reflecting a consolidated net operating loss of 
$500,000. On January 1, 1968, individual X purchases all of the 
outstanding stock of P. X subsequently contributes $1,000,000 to P and P 
purchases the stock of corporation T. P, S, and T file a consolidated 
return for 1968 reflecting consolidated taxable income of $600,000 
(computed without regard to the consolidated net operating loss 
deduction). Such consolidated taxable income recomputed by including 
only the items of income and deduction of P and S is $350,000.
    (ii) Since a consolidated return change of ownership took place in 
1968 (there was more than a 50 percent change of ownership of P), the 
amount of the consolidated net operating loss from 1967 which can be 
carried over to 1968 is limited to $350,000, the excess of $350,000 
(consolidated taxable income recomputed by including only the items of 
income and deduction of the old members of the group, P and S) over zero 
(the amount of the consolidated net operating loss carryovers 
attributable to the old members of the group arising in taxable years 
ending before 1967).

    (4) Cross-reference. See Sec. 1.1502-21T(d)(1) for the rule that 
applies the principles of this paragraph (d) in consolidated return 
years beginning on or after January 1, 1997, with respect to a 
consolidated return change of ownership occurring before January 1, 
1997.
    (e) Limitations on net operating loss carryovers under section 382--
(1) Section 382(a). (i) If at the end of a taxable year (consolidated or 
separate) there has been an increase in ownership of the stock of the 
common parent of a group (within the meaning of section 382(a)(1) (A) 
and (B)), and any member of the group has not continued to carry on a 
trade or business substantially the same as that conducted before any 
such increase (within the meaning of section 382(a)(1)(C)), then the 
portion of any consolidated net operating loss sustained in prior 
taxable years attributable to such member (as determined under this 
paragraph shall not be allowed as a carryover to such taxable year or to 
any subsequent taxable year.
    (ii) If the provisions of section 382(a) disallow the deduction of a 
net operating loss carryover from a separate return year of a member of 
the group to a subsequent taxable year, no amount shall be included 
under paragraph (b) of this section as a consolidated net operating loss 
carryover to such a subsequent consolidated return year with respect to 
such separate return year of such member.

[[Page 579]]

    (iii) The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the 
following example:

    Example. P, S, and T file a consolidated return for the calendar 
year 1969, reflecting a consolidated net operating loss attributable in 
part to each member. P owns 80 percent of S's stock and S owns 80 
percent of T's stock. On January 1, 1970, A purchases 50 percent of P's 
stock. During 1970 T's business is discontinued. Since there has been a 
50 percentage point increase in ownership of P, the common parent of the 
group, and since T has not continued to carry on the same trade or 
business after such increase, the portion of the 1969 consolidated net 
operating loss attributable to T shall not be included in any net 
operating loss deduction for 1970 or for any subsequent taxable years, 
whether consolidated or separate.

    (2) Section 382(b). If a net operating loss carryover from a 
separate return year of a predecessor of a member of the group to the 
taxable year is reduced under the provisions of section 382(b), the 
amount included under paragraph (b) of this section with respect to such 
predecessor shall be so reduced.
    (3) Effective date. This paragraph (e) disallows or reduces the net 
operating loss carryovers of a member as a result of a transaction to 
which old section 382 (as defined in Sec. 1.382-2T(f)(21)) applies. See 
Sec. 1.1502-21T(d)(2) for the rule that applies the principles of this 
paragraph (e) in consolidated return years beginning on or after January 
1, 1997, with respect to such a transaction.
    (f) Consolidated net operating loss. The consolidated net operating 
loss shall be determined by taking into account the following:
    (1) The separate taxable income (as determined under Sec. 1.1502-
12) of each member of the group, computed without regard to any 
deduction under section 242;
    (2) Any consolidated capital gain net income (net capital gain for 
taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977);
    (3) Any consolidated section 1231 net loss;
    (4) Any consolidated charitable contributions deduction;
    (5) Any consolidated dividends received deduction (determined under 
Sec. 1.1502-26 without regard to paragraph (a)(2) of that section); and
    (6) Any consolidated section 247 deduction (determined under Sec. 
1.1502-27 without regard to paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of that section).
    (g) Groups that include insolvent financial institutions. For rules 
applicable to relinquishing the entire carryback period with respect to 
losses attributable to insolvent financial institutions, see Sec. 
301.6402-7 of this chapter.
    (h) Effective date. Except as provided in Sec. 1.1502-21T (d)(1), 
(d)(2), and (g)(3), this section applies to consolidated return years 
beginning before January 1, 1997.

Sec. 1.1502-22A  Consolidated net capital gain or loss generally 
applicable for consolidated return years beginning before January 1, 1997.

    (a) Computation--(1) Consolidated capital gain net income. The 
consolidated capital gain net income (net capital gain for taxable years 
beginning before January 1, 1977) for the taxable year shall be 
determined by taking into account:
    (i) The aggregate of the capital gains and losses (determined 
without regard to gains or losses to which section 1231 applies or net 
capital loss carryovers or carrybacks) of the members of the group for 
the consolidated return year,
    (ii) The consolidated section 1231 net gain for such year (computed 
in accordance with Sec. Sec. 1.1502-23A or 1.1502-23T), and
    (iii) The consolidated net capital loss carryovers or carrybacks to 
such year (as determined under paragraph (b) of this section).
    (2) Consolidated net capital loss. The consolidated net capital loss 
shall be determined under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph but without 
regard to subdivision (iii) thereof.
    (3) Special rules. For purposes of this section, capital gains and 
losses on intercompany transactions and transactions with respect to 
stock, bonds, and other obligations of a member of the group shall be 
reflected as provided in Sec. Sec. 1.1502-13, and 1.1502-19, and 
capital losses shall be limited as provided in Sec. Sec. 1.1502-15A 
and 1.1502-11(c).
    (4) [Reserved]

[[Page 580]]

    (5) Example. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by 
the following example:

    Example. (i) Corporations P, S, and T file consolidated returns on a 
calendar year basis for 1966 and 1967. The members had the following 
transactions involving capital assets during 1967: P sold an asset with 
a $10,000 basis to S for $17,000 and none of the circumstances of 
restoration described in Sec. 1.1502-13 occurred by the end of the 
consolidated return year; S sold an asset to individual A for $7,000 
which S had purchased during 1966 from P for $10,000, and with respect 
to which P had deferred a gain of $2,000; T sold an asset with a basis 
of $10,000 to individual B for $25,000. The group has a consolidated net 
capital loss carryover to the taxable year of $10,000.
    (ii) The consolidated net capital gain of the group is $4,000, 
determined as follows: P's net capital gain of $2,000, representing the 
deferred gain on the sale to S during the taxable year 1966, restored 
into income during taxable year 1967 (the $7,000 gain on P's deferred 
intercompany transaction is not taken into account for the current 
year), plus T's net capital gain of $15,000, minus S's net capital loss 
of $3,000 and the consolidated net capital loss carryover of $10,000.

    (b) Consolidated net capital loss carryovers and carrybacks--(1) In 
general. The consolidated net capital loss carryovers and carrybacks to 
the taxable year shall consist of any consolidated net capital losses of 
the group, plus any net capital losses of members of the group arising 
in separate return years of such members, which may be carried to the 
taxable year under the principles of section 1212(a). However, such 
consolidated carryovers and carrybacks shall not include any 
consolidated net capital loss apportioned to a corporation for a 
separate return year pursuant to Sec. 1.1502-79A(b) (or Sec. 1.1502-
22T(b), as appropriate) and shall be subject to the limitations 
contained in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. For purposes of 
section 1212(a)(1), the portion of any consolidated net capital loss for 
any taxable year attributable to a foreign expropriation capital loss is 
the amount of the foreign expropriation capital losses of all the 
members for such year (but not in excess of the consolidated net capital 
loss for such year).
    (2) Absorption rules. For purposes of determining the amount, if 
any, of a net capital loss (whether consolidated or separate) which can 
be carried to a taxable year (consolidated or separate), the amount of 
such net capital loss which is absorbed in a prior consolidated return 
year under section 1212(a)(1) shall be determined by:
    (i) Applying all net capital losses which can be carried to such 
prior year in the order of the taxable years in which such losses were 
sustained, beginning with the taxable year which ends earliest, and
    (ii) Applying all such losses which can be carried to such prior 
year from taxable years ending on the same date on a prorata basis, 
except that any portion of a net capital loss attributable to a foreign 
expropriation capital loss to which section 1212(a)(1)(B) applies shall 
be applied last.
    (c) Limitation on net capital loss carryovers and carrybacks from 
separate return limitation years--(1) General rule. In the case of a net 
capital loss of a member of the group arising in a separate return 
limitation year (as defined in paragraph (f) of Sec. 1.1502-1) of such 
member (and in a separate return limitation year of any predecessor of 
such member), the amount that may be included under paragraph (b) of 
this section (computed without regard to the limitation contained in 
paragraph (d) of this section) shall not exceed the amount determined 
under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.
    (2) Computation of limitation. The amount referred to in 
subparagraph (1) of this paragraph with respect to a member of the group 
is the excess, if any, of:
    (i) The consolidated capital gain net income (net capital gain for 
taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) for the taxable year 
(computed without regard to any net capital loss carryovers and 
carrybacks), minus such consolidated capital gain net income (net 
capital gain for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) for the 
taxable year recomputed by excluding the capital gains and losses and 
the gains and losses to which section 1231 applies of such member, over
    (ii) The net capital losses attributable to such member which can be 
carried to the taxable year arising in taxable years ending prior to the 
particular separate return limitation year.

[[Page 581]]

    (d) Limitation on capital loss carryovers where there has been a 
consolidated return change of ownership--(1) General rule. If a 
consolidated return change of ownership (as defined in paragraph (g) of 
Sec. 1.1502-1) occurs during the taxable year or an earlier taxable 
year, the amount which may be included under paragraph (b) of this 
section in the consolidated net capital loss carryovers to the taxable 
year with respect to the aggregate of the net capital losses 
attributable to old members of the group (as defined in paragraph (g)(3) 
of Sec. 1.1502-1) arising in taxable years (consolidated or separate) 
ending on the same day and before the taxable year in which the 
consolidated return change of ownership occurred shall not exceed the 
amount determined under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.
    (2) Computation of limitation. The amount referred to in 
subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall be the excess of:
    (i) The consolidated capital gain net income (net capital gain for 
taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) (determined without 
regard to any net capital loss carryovers for the taxable year) 
recomputed by including only capital gains and losses and gains and 
losses to which section 1231 applies of the old members of the group, 
over
    (ii) The aggregate net capital losses attributable to the old 
members of the group which may be carried to the taxable year arising in 
taxable years ending prior to the particular loss year or years.
    (3) Cross-reference. See Sec. 1.1502-22T(d) for the rule that 
applies the principles of this paragraph (d) in consolidated return 
years beginning on or after January 1, 1997, with respect to a 
consolidated return change of ownership occurring before January 1, 
1997.
    (e) Effective date. This section applies to any consolidated return 
years to which Sec. 1.1502-21T(g) does not apply. See Sec. 1.1502-
21T(g) for effective dates of that section.

year shall be determined by taking into account the aggregate of the 
gains and losses to which section 1231 applies of the members of the 
group for the consolidated return year. Section 1231 gains and losses on 
intercompany transactions shall be reflected as provided in Sec. 
1.1502-13. Section 1231 losses that are ``built-in deductions'' shall be 
subject to the limitations of Sec. Sec. 1.1502-21A(c) and 1.1502-
22A(c), as provided in Sec. 1.1502-15A(a) (or Sec. 1.1502-21T(c) in

those gains and losses to which Sec. 1.1502-22A(a) applies which are 
treated as long term under section 1222, and (2) the consolidated 
section 1231 net gain (computed in accordance with Sec. 1.1502-23A).

 REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO TAXABLE YEARS BEGINNING BEFORE JUNE 28, 2002


<R05>
Sec. 1.1502-77A  Common parent agent for subsidiaries applicable for 
consolidated return years beginning before June 28, 2002.

    (a) Scope of agency of common parent corporation. The common parent, 
for all purposes (other than the making of the consent required by 
paragraph (a)(1) of Sec. 1.1502-75, the making of an election under 
section 936(e), the making of an election to be treated as a DISC under 
Sec. 1.992-2, and a change of the annual accounting period pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of Sec. 1.991-1) shall be the sole agent for each 
subsidiary in the group, duly authorized to act in its own name in all 
matters relating to the tax liability for the consolidated return year. 
Except as provided in the preceding sentence, no subsidiary shall have 
authority to act for or to represent itself in any such matter. For 
example, any election available to a subsidiary corporation in the 
computation of its seperate taxable income must be made by the common 
parent, as must any change in an election previously made by the 
subsidiary corporation; all correspondence will be carried on directly 
with the common parent; the common parent shall file for all extensions 
of time including extensions of time for payment of tax under section 
6164; notices of deficiencies will be mailed only to the common parent, 
and the mailing to the common parent shall be considered as a mailing to 
each subsidiary in the group; notice and demand for payment of taxes 
will be given only to the common parent and such notice and demand will 
be considered as a notice and demand to each subsidiary; the common 
parent will file petitions and conduct proceedings before the Tax Court 
of the United States, and any such petition shall be considered as also 
having been filed by each such subsidiary. The common parent will file 
claims for refund or credit, and any refund will be made directly to and 
in the name of the common parent and will discharge any liability of the 
Government in respect thereof to any such subsidiary; and the common 
parent in its name will give waivers, give bonds, and execute closing 
agreements, offers in compromise, and all other documents, and any 
waiver or bond so given, or agreement, offer in compromise, or any other 
document so executed, shall be considered as having also been given or 
executed by each such subsidiary. Notwithstanding the provisions of this 
paragraph, any notice of deficiency, in respect of the tax for a 
consolidated return year, will name each corporation which was a member 
of the group during any part of such period (but a failure to include 
the name of any such member will not affect the validity of the notice 
of deficiency as to the other members); any notice and demand for 
payment will name each corporation which was a member of the group 
during any part of such period (but a failure to include the name of any 
such member will not affect the validity of the notice and demand as to 
the other members); and any levy, any notice of a lien, or any other 
proceeding to collect the amount of any assessment, after the assessment 
has been made, will name the corporation from which such collection is 
to be made. The provisions of this paragraph shall apply whether or not 
a consolidated return is made for any subsequent year, and

[[Page 583]]

whether or not one or more subsidiaries have become or have ceased to be 
members of the group at any time. Notwithstanding the provisions of this 
paragraph, the Commissioner may, upon notifying the common parent, deal 
directly with any member of the group in respect of its liability, in 
which event such member shall have full authority to act for itself.
    (b) Notification of deficiency to corporation which has ceased to be 
a member of the group. If a subsidiary has ceased to be a member of the 
group and if such subsidiary files written notice of such cessation with 
the Commissioner, then the Commissioner upon request of such subsidiary 
will furnish it with a copy of any notice of deficiency in respect of 
the tax for a consolidated return year for which it was a member and a 
copy of any notice and demand for payment of such deficiency. The filing 
of such written notification and request by a corporation shall not have 
the effect of limiting the scope of the agency of the common parent 
provided for in paragraph (a) of this section and a failure by the 
Commissioner to comply with such written request shall not have the 
effect of limiting the tax liability of such corporation provided for in 
Sec. 1.1502-6.
    (c) Effect of waiver given by common parent. Unless the Commissioner 
agrees to the contrary, an agreement entered into by the common parent 
extending the time within which an assessment may be made or levy or 
proceeding in court begun in respect of the tax for a consolidated 
return year shall be applicable:
    (1) To each corporation which was a member of the group during any 
part of such taxable year, and
    (2) To each corporation the income of which was included in the 
consolidated return for such taxable year, notwithstanding that the tax 
liability of any such corporation is subsequently computed on the basis 
of a separate return under the provisions of Sec. 1.1502-75.
    (d) Effect of dissolution of common parent corporation. If the 
common parent corporation contemplates dissolution, or is about to be 
dissolved, or if for any other reason its existence is about to 
terminate, it shall forthwith notify the Commissioner of such fact and 
designate, subject to the approval of the Commissioner, another member 
to act as agent in its place to the same extent and subject to the same 
conditions and limitations as are applicable to the common parent. If 
the notice thus required is not given by the common parent, or the 
designation is not approved by the Commissioner, the remaining members 
may, subject to the approval of the Commissioner, designate another 
member to act as such agent, and notice of such designation shall be 
given to the Commissioner. Until a notice in writing designating a new 
agent has been approved by the Commissioner, any notice of deficiency or 
other communication mailed to the common parent shall be considered as 
having been properly mailed to the agent of the group; or, if the 
Commissioner has reason to believe that the existence of the common 
parent has terminated, he may, if he deems it advisable, deal directly 
with any member in respect of its liability.
    (e) General rules--(1) Scope. This section applies if the 
corporation that is the common parent of the group ceases to be the 
common parent, whether or not the group remains in existence under Sec. 
1.1502-75(d).
    (2) Notice of deficiency. A notice of deficiency mailed to any one 
or more corporations referred to in paragraph (a)(4) of this section is 
deemed for purposes of Sec. 1.1502-77 to be mailed to the agent of the 
group. If the group has designated an agent that has been approved by 
the Commissioner under Sec. 1.1502-77(d), a notice of deficiency shall 
be mailed to that designated agent in addition to any other corporation 
referred to in paragraph (a)(4) of this section. However, failure by the 
Commissioner to mail a notice of deficiency to that designated agent 
shall not invalidate the notice of deficiency mailed to any other 
corporation referred to in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
    (3) Waiver of statute of limitations. A waiver of the statute of 
limitations with respect to the group given by any one or more 
corporations referred to in paragraph (a)(4) of this section is deemed 
to be given by the agent of the group.

[[Page 584]]

    (4) Alternative agents. The corporations referred to in paragraph 
(a) (2) and (3) of this section are--
    (i) The common parent of the group for all or any part of the year 
to which the notice or waiver applies,
    (ii) A successor to the former common parent in a transaction to 
which section 381(a) applies,
    (iii) The agent designated by the group under Sec. 1.1502-77(d), or
    (iv) If the group remains in existence under Sec. 1.1502-75(d) (2) 
or (3), the common parent of the group at the time the notice is mailed 
or the waiver given.
    (f) Cross-reference. For further rules applicable to groups that 
include insolvent financial institutions, see Sec. 301.6402-7 of this 
chapter.
    (g) Effective date. This section applies to taxable years beginning 
before June 28, 2002, except paragraph (e) of this section applies to 
statutory notices and waivers of the statute of limitations for taxable 
years for which the due date (without extensions) of the consolidated 
return is after September 7, 1988, and which begin before June 28, 2002.

     REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO TAXABLE YEARS BEFORE JANUARY 1, 1997


<R05>
Sec. 1.1502-79A  Separate return years generally applicable for consolidated 
return years beginning before January 1, 1997.

    (a) Carryover and carryback of consolidated net operating losses to 
separate return years--(1) In general. (i) If a consolidated net 
operating loss can be carried under the principles of section 172(b) and 
paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.1502-21A to a separate return year of a 
corporation (or could have been so carried if such corporation were in 
existence) which was a member in the year in which such loss arose, then 
the portion of such consolidated net operating loss attributable to such 
corporation (as determined under subparagraph (3) of this paragraph) 
shall be apportioned to such corporation (and any successor to such 
corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies) and shall 
be a net operating loss carryover or carryback to such separate return 
year; accordingly, such portion shall not be included in the 
consolidated net operating loss carryovers or carrybacks to the 
equivalent consolidated return year. Thus, for example, if a member 
filed a separate return for the third year preceding a consolidated 
return year in which a consolidated net operating loss was sustained and 
if any portion of such loss is apportioned to such member for such 
separate return year, such portion may not be carried back by the group 
to its third year preceding such consolidated return year.
    (ii) If a corporation ceases to be a member during a consolidated 
return year, any consolidated net operating loss carryover from a prior 
taxable year must first be carried to such consolidated return year, 
notwithstanding that all or a portion of the consolidated net operating 
loss giving rise to the carryover is attributable to the corporation 
which ceases to be a member. To the extent not absorbed in such 
consolidated return year, the portion of the consolidated net operating 
loss attributable to the corporation ceasing to be a member shall then 
be carried to such corporation's first separate return year.
    (iii) For rules permitting the reattribution of losses of a 
subsidiary to the common parent in the case of loss disallowance or 
basis reduction on the disposition or deconsolidation of stock of the 
subsidiary, see Sec. 1.1502-20.
    (2) Nonapportionment to certain members not in existence. 
Notwithstanding subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the portion of a 
consolidated net operating loss attributable to a member shall not be 
apportioned to a prior separate return year for which such member was 
not in existence and shall be included in the consolidated net operating 
loss carrybacks to the equivalent consolidated return year of the group 
(or, if such equivalent year is a separate return year, then to such 
separate return year), provided that such member was a member of the 
group immediately after its organization.

[[Page 585]]

    (3) Portion of consolidated net operating loss attributable to a 
member. The portion of a consolidated net operating loss attributable to 
a member of a group is an amount equal to the consolidated net operating 
loss multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the separate 
net operating loss of such corporation, and the denominator of which is 
the sum of the separate net operating losses of all members of the group 
in such year having such losses. For purposes of this subparagraph, the 
separate net operating loss of a member of the group shall be determined 
under Sec. 1.1502-12 (except that no deduction shall be allowed under 
section 242), adjusted for the following items taken into account in the 
computation of the consolidated net operating loss:
    (i) The portion of the consolidated dividends received deduction, 
the consolidated charitable contributions deductions, and the 
consolidated section 247 deduction, attributable to such member;
    (ii) Such member's capital gain net income (net capital gain for 
taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) (determined without 
regard to any net capital loss carryover attributable to such member);
    (iii) Such member's net capital loss and section 1231 net loss, 
reduced by the portion of the consolidated net capital loss attributable 
to such member (as determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section); 
and
    (iv) The portion of any consolidated net capital loss carryover 
attributable to such member which is absorbed in the taxable year.
    (4) Examples. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by 
the following examples:

    Example (1). (i) Corporation P was formed on January 1, 1966. P 
filed a separate return for the calendar year 1966. On March 15, 1967, P 
formed corporation S. P and S filed a consolidated return for 1967. On 
January 1, 1968, P purchased all the stock of corporation T, which had 
been formed in 1967 and had filed a separate return for its taxable year 
ending December 31, 1967.
    (ii) P, S, and T join in the filing of a consolidated return for 
1968, which return reflects a consolidated net operating loss of 
$11,000. $2,000 of such consolidated net operating loss is attributable 
to P, $3,000 to S, and $6,000 to T. Such apportionment of the 
consolidated net operating loss was made on the basis of the separate 
net operating losses of each member as determined under subparagraph (3) 
of this paragraph.
    (iii) $5,000 of the 1968 consolidated net operating loss can be 
carried back to P's separate return for 1966. Such amount is the portion 
of the consolidated net operating loss attributable to P and S. Even 
though S was not in existence in 1966, the portion attributable to S can 
be carried back to P's separate return year, since S (unlike T) was a 
member of the group immediately after its organization. The 1968 
consolidated net operating loss can be carried back against the group's 
income in 1967 except to the extent (i.e., $6,000) that it is 
apportioned to T for its 1967 separate return year and to the extent 
that it was absorbed in P's 1966 separate return year. The portion of 
the 1968 consolidated net operating loss attributable to T ($6,000) is a 
net operating loss carryback to its 1967 separate return.
    Example (2). (i) Assume the same facts as in example (1). Assume 
further that on June 15, 1969, P sells all the stock of T to an 
outsider, that P and S file a consolidated return for 1969 (which 
includes the income of T for the period January 1 through June 15), and 
that T files a separate return for the period June 16 through December 
31, 1969.
    (ii) The 1968 consolidated net operating loss, to the extent not 
absorbed in prior years, must first be carried to the consolidated 
return year 1969. Any portion of the $6,000 amount attributable to T 
which is not absorbed in T's 1967 separate return year or in the 1969 
consolidated return year shall then be carried to T's separate return 
year ending December 31, 1969.

    (b) Carryover and carryback of consolidated net capital loss to 
separate return years--(1) In general. If a consolidated net capital 
loss can be carried under the principles of section 1212(a) and 
paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.1502-22A to a separate return year of a 
corporation (or could have been so carried if such corporation were in 
existence) which was a member of the group in the year in which such 
consolidated net capital loss arose, then the portion of such 
consolidated net capital loss attributable to such corporation (as 
determined under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph) shall be 
apportioned to such corporation (and any successor to such corporation 
in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies) under the principles 
of paragraph (a) (1), (2) and (3) of this section and shall be a net 
capital loss carryback or carryover to such separate return year.

[[Page 586]]

    (2) Portion of consolidated net capital loss attributable to a 
member. The portion of a consolidated net capital loss attributable to a 
member of a group is an amount equal to such consolidated net capital 
loss multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the net capital 
loss of such member, and the denominator of which is the sum of the net 
capital losses of those members of the group having net capital losses. 
For purposes of this subparagraph, the net capital loss of a member of 
the group shall be determined by taking into account the following:
    (i) Such member's capital gain net income (net capital gain for 
taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) or loss (determined 
without regard to any net capital loss carryover or carryback); and
    (ii) Such member's section 1231 net loss, reduced by the portion of 
the consolidated section 1231 net loss attributable to such member.
    (c)-(e) [Reserved]
    (f) Effective date. Paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section apply to 
losses arising in consolidated return years to which Sec. 1.1502-21T(g) 
does not apply. For this purpose net operating loss deductions, 
carryovers, and carrybacks arise in the year from which they are 
carried. See Sec. 1.1502-21T(g) for effective dates of that section.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1502-91A  Application of section 382 with respect to a consolidated 
group generally applicable for testing dates before June 25, 1999.

    (a) Determination and effect of an ownership change--(1) In general. 
This section and Sec. Sec. 1.1502-92A and 1.1502-93A set forth the 
rules for determining an ownership change under section 382 for members 
of consolidated groups and the section 382 limitations with respect to 
attributes described in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section. These 
rules generally provide that an ownership change and the section 382 
limitation are determined with respect to these attributes for the group 
(or loss subgroup) on a single entity basis and not for its members 
separately. Following an ownership change of a loss group (or a loss 
subgroup) under Sec. 1.1502-92A, the amount of consolidated taxable 
income for any post-change year which may be offset by pre-change 
consolidated attributes (or pre-change subgroup attributes) shall not 
exceed the consolidated section 382 limitation (or subgroup section 382 
limitation) for such year as determined under Sec. 1.1502-93A.
    (2) Special rule for post-change year that includes the change date. 
If the post-change year includes the change date, section 382(b)(3)(A) 
is applied so that the consolidated section 382 limitation (or subgroup 
section 382 limitation) does not apply to the portion of consolidated 
taxable income that is allocable to the period in the year on or before 
the change date. See generally Sec. 1.382-6 (relating to the allocation 
of income and loss). The allocation of consolidated taxable income for 
the post-change year that includes the change date must be made before 
taking into account any consolidated net operating loss deduction (as 
defined in Sec. 1.1502-21(a) or 1.1502-21T(a) in effect prior to June 
25, 1999, as contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 1999, as 
applicable).
    (3) Cross reference. See Sec. Sec. 1.1502-94A and 1.1502-95A for 
rules that apply section 382 to a corporation that becomes or ceases to 
be a member of a group or loss subgroup.
    (b) Definitions and nomenclature. For purposes of this section and 
Sec. Sec. 1.1502-92A through 1.1502-99A, unless otherwise stated:
    (1) The definitions and nomenclature contained in section 382 and 
the regulations thereunder (including the nomenclature and assumptions 
relating to the examples in Sec. 1.382-2T(b)) and this section and 
Sec. Sec. 1.1502-92A through 1.1502-99A apply; and
    (2) In all examples, all groups file consolidated returns, all 
corporations file their income tax returns on a calendar year basis, the 
only 5-percent shareholder of a corporation is a public group, the facts 
set forth the only owner shifts during the testing period, and each 
asset of a corporation has a value equal to its adjusted basis.
    (c) Loss group--(1) Defined. A loss group is a consolidated group 
that:
    (i) Is entitled to use a net operating loss carryover to the taxable 
year that did not arise (and is not treated under Sec. 1.1502-21T(c) as 
arising) in a SRLY;
    (ii) Has a consolidated net operating loss for the taxable year in 
which a testing date of the common parent occurs (determined by treating 
the common parent as a loss corporation); or
    (iii) Has a net unrealized built-in loss (determined under paragraph 
(g) of this section by treating the date on which the determination is 
made as though it were a change date).
    (2) Coordination with rule that ends separate tracking. A 
consolidated group may be a loss group because a member's losses that 
arose in (or are treated as arising in) a SRLY are treated as described 
in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. See Sec. 1.1502-96A(a).
    (3) Example. The following example illustrates the principles of 
this paragraph (c).

    Example. Loss group. (a) L and L1 file separate returns and each has 
a net operating loss carryover arising in Year 1 that is carried over to 
Year 2. A owns 40 shares and L owns 60 shares of the 100 outstanding 
shares of L1 stock. At the close of Year 1, L buys the 40 shares of L1 
stock from A. For Year 2, L and L1 file a consolidated return. The 
following is a graphic illustration of these facts:

[[Page 589]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27JN96.002

    (b) L and L1 become a loss group at the beginning of Year 2 because 
the group is entitled to use the Year 1 net operating loss carryover of 
L, the common parent, which did not arise (and is not treated under 
Sec. 1.1502-21(c) or 1.1502-21T(c) in effect prior to June 25, 1999, as 
contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 1999, as applicable as 
arising) in a SRLY. See Sec. 1.1502-94A for rules relating to the 
application of section 382 with respect to L1's net operating loss 
carryover from Year 1 which did arise in a SRLY.

    (d) Loss subgroup--(1) Net operating loss carryovers. Two or more 
corporations that become members of a consolidated group (the current 
group) compose a loss subgroup if:

[[Page 590]]

    (i) They were affiliated with each other in another group (the 
former group), whether or not the group was a consolidated group;
    (ii) They bear the relationship described in section 1504(a)(1) to 
each other through a loss subgroup parent immediately after they become 
members of the current group; and
    (iii) At least one of the members carries over a net operating loss 
that did not arise (and is not treated under Sec. 1.1502-21(c) or 
1.1502-21T(c) in effect prior to June 25, 1999, as contained in 26 CFR 
part 1 revised April 1, 1999, as applicable as arising) in a SRLY with 
respect to the former group.
    (2) Net unrealized built-in loss. Two or more corporations that 
become members of a consolidated group compose a loss subgroup if they:
    (i) Have been continuously affiliated with each other for the 5 
consecutive year period ending immediately before they become members of 
the group;
    (ii) Bear the relationship described in section 1504(a)(1) to each 
other through a loss subgroup parent immediately after they become 
members of the current group; and
    (iii) Have a net unrealized built-in loss (determined under 
paragraph (g) of this section on the day they become members of the 
group by treating that day as though it were a change date).
    (3) Loss subgroup parent. A loss subgroup parent is the corporation 
that bears the same relationship to the other members of the loss 
subgroup as a common parent bears to the members of a group.
    (4) Principal purpose of avoiding a limitation. The corporations 
described in paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section do not compose a 
loss subgroup if any one of them is formed, acquired, or availed of with 
a principal purpose of avoiding the application of, or increasing any 
limitation under, section 382. Instead, Sec. 1.1502-94A applies with 
respect to the attributes of each such corporation. This paragraph 
(d)(4) does not apply solely because, in connection with becoming 
members of the group, the members of a group (or loss subgroup) are 
rearranged to bear a relationship to the other members described in 
section 1504(a)(1).
    (5) Special rules. See Sec. 1.1502-95A(d) for rules concerning when 
a corporation ceases to be a member of a loss subgroup. See also Sec. 
1.1502-96A(a) for a special rule regarding the end of separate tracking 
of SRLY losses of a member that has an ownership change or that has been 
a member of a group for at least 5 consecutive years.
    (6) Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of 
this paragraph (d).

    Example 1. Loss subgroup. (a) P owns all the L stock and L owns all 
the L1 stock. The P group has a consolidated net operating loss arising 
in Year 1 that is carried to Year 2. On May 2, Year 2, P sells all the 
stock of L to A, and L and L1 thereafter file consolidated returns. A 
portion of the Year 1 consolidated net operating loss is apportioned 
under Sec. 1.1502-21(b) or 1.1502-21T(b) in effect prior to June 25, 
1999, as contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 1999, as applicable 
to each of L and L1, which they carry over to Year 2. The following is a 
graphic illustration of these facts:

[[Page 591]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27JN96.003

    (b) (1) L and L1 compose a loss subgroup within the meaning of 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section because--
    (i) They were affiliated with each other in the P group (the former 
group);
    (ii) They bear a relationship described in section 1504(a)(1) to 
each other through a loss subgroup parent (L) immediately after they 
became members of the L group; and
    (iii) At least one of the members (here, both L and L1) carries over 
a net operating loss to the L group (the current group) that did not 
arise in a SRLY with respect to the P group.
    (2) Under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, L is the loss subgroup 
parent of the L loss subgroup.
    Example 2. Loss subgroup--section 1504(a)(1) relationship.

[[Page 592]]

    (a) P owns all the stock of L and L1. L owns all the stock of L2. L1 
and L2 own 40 percent and 60 percent of the stock of L3, respectively. 
The P group has a consolidated net operating loss arising in Year 1 that 
is carried over to Year 2. On May 22, Year 2, P sells all the stock of L 
and L1 to P1, the common parent of another consolidated group. The Year 
1 consolidated net operating loss is apportioned under Sec. 1.1502-
21(b) or 1.1502-21T(b) in effect prior to June 25, 1999, as contained in 
26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 1999, as applicable, and each of L, L1, 
L2, and L3 carries over a portion of such loss to the first consolidated 
return year of the P1 group ending after the acquisition. The following 
is a graphic illustration of these facts:

[[Page 593]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27JN96.004

    (b) L and L2 compose a loss subgroup within the meaning of paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section. Neither L1 nor L3 is included in a loss subgroup 
because neither bears a relationship described in section 1504(a)(1) 
through a loss subgroup parent to any other member of the former group 
immediately after becoming members of the P1 group.
    Example 3. Loss subgroup--section 1504(a)(1) relationship. The facts 
are the same as in Example 2, except that the stock of L1 is transferred 
to L in connection with the sale of the

[[Page 594]]

L stock to P1. L, L1, L2, and L3 compose a loss subgroup within the 
meaning of paragraph (d)(1) of this section because--
    (1) They were affiliated with each other in the P group (the former 
group);
    (2) They bear a relationship described in section 1504(a)(1) to each 
other through a loss subgroup parent (L) immediately after they become 
members of the P1 group; and
    (3) At least one of the members (here, each of L, L1, L2, and L3) 
carries over to the P1 group (the current group) a net operating loss 
that did not arise in a SRLY with respect to the P group (the former 
group).

    (e) Pre-change consolidated attribute--(1) Defined. A pre-change 
consolidated attribute of a loss group is--
    (i) Any loss described in paragraph (c)(1) (i) or (ii) of this 
section (relating to the definition of loss group) that is allocable to 
the period ending on or before the change date; and
    (ii) Any recognized built-in loss of the loss group.
    (2) Example. The following example illustrates the principle of this 
paragraph (e).

    Example. Pre-change consolidated attribute. (a) The L group has a 
consolidated net operating loss arising in Year 1 that is carried over 
to Year 2. The L loss group has an ownership change at the beginning of 
Year 2.
    (b) The net operating loss carryover of the L loss group from Year 1 
is a pre-change consolidated attribute because the L group was entitled 
to use the loss in Year 2, the loss did not arise in a SRLY with respect 
to the L group, and therefore the loss was described in paragraph 
(c)(1)(i) of this section. Under paragraph (a) of this section, the 
amount of consolidated taxable income of the L group for Year 2 that may 
be offset by this loss carryover may not exceed the consolidated section 
382 limitation of the L group for that year. See Sec. 1.1502-93A for 
rules relating to the computation of the consolidated section 382 
limitation.

    (f) Pre-change subgroup attribute--(1) Defined. A pre-change 
subgroup attribute of a loss subgroup is--
    (i) Any net operating loss carryover described in paragraph 
(d)(1)(iii) of this section (relating to the definition of loss 
subgroup); and
    (ii) Any recognized built-in loss of the loss subgroup.
    (2) Example. The following example illustrates the principle of this 
paragraph (f).

    Example. Pre-change subgroup attribute. (a) P is the common parent 
of a consolidated group. P owns all the stock of L, and L owns all the 
stock of L1. L2 is not a member of an affiliated group, and has a net 
operating loss arising in Year 1 that is carried over to Year 2. On 
December 11, Year 2, L1 acquires all the stock of L2, causing an 
ownership change of L2. During Year 2, the P group has a consolidated 
net operating loss that is carried over to Year 3. On November 2, Year 
3, M acquires all the L stock from P. M, L, L1, and L2 thereafter file 
consolidated returns. All of the P group Year 2 consolidated net 
operating loss is apportioned under Sec. 1.1502-21(b) or 1.1502-21T(b) 
in effect prior to June 25, 1999, as contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised 
April 1, 1999, as applicable to L and L2, which they carry over to the M 
group.
    (b)(1) L, L1, and L2 compose a loss subgroup because--
    (i) They were affiliated with each other in the P group (the former 
group);
    (ii) They bore a relationship described in section 1504(a)(1) to 
each other through a loss subgroup parent (L) immediately after they 
became members of the L group; and
    (iii) At least one of the members (here, both L and L2) carries over 
a net operating loss to the M group (the current group) that is 
described in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (2) For this purpose, L2's loss from Year 1 that was a SRLY loss 
with respect to the P group (the former group) is treated as described 
in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section because of the application of 
the principles of Sec. 1.1502-96A(a). See paragraph (d)(5) of this 
section. M's acquisition results in an ownership change of L, and 
therefore the L loss subgroup under Sec. 1.1502-92A(a)(2). See Sec. 
1.1502-93A for rules governing the computation of the subgroup section 
382 limitation.
    (c) In the M group, L2's Year 1 loss continues to be subject to a 
section 382 limitation resulting from the ownership change that occurred 
on December 11, Year 2. See Sec. 1.1502-96A(c).

    (g) Net unrealized built-in gain and loss--(1) In general. The 
determination whether a consolidated group (or loss subgroup) has a net 
unrealized built-in gain or loss under section 382(h)(3) is based on the 
aggregate amount of the separately computed net unrealized built-in 
gains or losses of each member that is included in the group (or loss 
subgroup) under paragraph (g)(2) of this section, including items of 
built-in income and deduction described in section 382(h)(6). Thus, for 
example, amounts deferred under section 267, or under Sec. 1.1502-13 
(other than amounts deferred with respect to the stock of a

[[Page 595]]

member (or an intercompany obligation) included in the group (or loss 
subgroup) under paragraph (g)(2) of this section) are built-in items. 
The threshold requirement under section 382(h)(3)(B) applies on an 
aggregate basis and not on a member-by-member basis. The separately 
computed amount of a member included in a group or loss subgroup does 
not include any unrealized built-in gain or loss on stock (including 
stock described in section 1504(a)(4) and Sec. 1.382-2T(f)(18)(ii) and 
(iii)) of another member included in the group or loss subgroup (or on 
an intercompany obligation). However, a member of a group or loss 
subgroup includes in its separately computed amount the unrealized 
built-in gain or loss on stock of another member (or on an intercompany 
obligation) not included in the group or loss subgroup. If a member is 
not included in a group (or loss subgroup) under paragraph (g)(2) of 
this section, the determination of whether the member has a net 
unrealized built-in gain or loss under section 382(h)(3) is made on a 
separate entity basis. See Sec. 1.1502-94A(c) (relating to built-in 
gain or loss of a new loss member) and Sec. 1.1502-96A(a) (relating to 
the end of separate tracking of certain losses).
    (2) Members included--(i) Consolidated group. The members included 
in the determination whether a consolidated group has a net unrealized 
built-in gain or loss are all members of the group on the day that the 
determination is made other than--
    (A) A new loss member with a net unrealized built-in loss described 
in Sec. 1.1502-94A(a)(1)(ii); and
    (B) Members included in a loss subgroup described in Sec. 1.1502-
91A(d)(2).
    (ii) Loss subgroup. The members included in the determination 
whether a loss subgroup has a net unrealized built-in gain or loss are 
those members described in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (ii) of this 
section.
    (3) Acquisitions of built-in gain or loss assets. A member of a 
consolidated group (or loss subgroup) may not, in determining its 
separately computed net unrealized built-in gain or loss, include any 
gain or loss with respect to assets acquired with a principal purpose to 
affect the amount of its net unrealized built-in gain or loss. A group 
(or loss subgroup) may not, in determining its net unrealized built-in 
gain or loss, include any gain or loss of a member acquired with a 
principal purpose to affect the amount of its net unrealized built-in 
gain or loss.
    (4) Indirect ownership. A member's separately computed net 
unrealized built-in gain or loss is adjusted to the extent necessary to 
prevent any duplication of unrealized gain or loss attributable to the 
member's indirect ownership interest in another member through a 
nonmember if the member has a 5-percent or greater ownership interest in 
the nonmember.
    (h) Recognized built-in gain or loss--(1) In general. [Reserved]
    (2) Disposition of stock or an intercompany obligation of a member. 
Gain or loss recognized by a member on the disposition of stock 
(including stock described in section 1504(a)(4) and Sec. 1.382-
2T(f)(18)(ii) and (iii)) of another member or an intercompany obligation 
disposed of before June 25, 1999 is treated as a recognized built-in 
gain or loss under section 382(h)(2) (unless disallowed under Sec. 
1.1502-20 or otherwise), even though gain or loss on such stock or 
obligation was not included in the determination of a net unrealized 
built-in gain or loss under paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
    (3) Deferred gain or loss. Gain or loss that is deferred under 
provisions such as section 267 and Sec. 1.1502-13 is treated as 
recognized built-in gain or loss only to the extent taken into account 
by the group during the recognition period.
    (4) Exchanged basis property. If the adjusted basis of any asset is 
determined, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by reference to 
the adjusted basis of another asset held by the member at the beginning 
of the recognition period, the asset is treated, with appropriate 
adjustments, as held by the member at the beginning of the recognition 
period.
    (i) [Reserved]
    (j) Predecessor and successor corporations. A reference in this 
section and Sec. Sec. 1.1502-92A through 1.1502-99A to a corporation, 
member, common parent, loss subgroup parent, or subsidiary includes, as 
the context may require, a

[[Page 596]]

reference to a predecessor or successor corporation. For example, the 
determination whether a successor satisfies the continuous affiliation 
requirement of paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section is made by reference 
to its predecessor.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1502-92A  Ownership change of a loss group or a loss subgroup 
generally applicable for testing dates before June 25, 1999.

    (a) Scope. This section provides rules for determining if there is 
an ownership change for purposes of section 382 with respect to a loss 
group or a loss subgroup. See Sec. 1.1502-94A for special rules for 
determining if there is an ownership change with respect to a new loss 
member and Sec. 1.1502-96A(b) for special rules for determining if 
there is an ownership change of a subsidiary.
    (b) Determination of an ownership change--(1) Parent change method--
(i) Loss group. A loss group has an ownership change if the loss group's 
common parent has an ownership change under section 382 and the 
regulations thereunder. Solely for purposes of determining whether the 
common parent has an ownership change--
    (A) The losses described in Sec. 1.1502-91A(c) are treated as net 
operating losses (or a net unrealized built-in loss) of the common 
parent; and
    (B) The common parent determines the earliest day that its testing 
period can begin by reference to only the attributes that make the group 
a loss group under Sec. 1.1502-91A(c).
    (ii) Loss subgroup. A loss subgroup has an ownership change if the 
loss subgroup parent has an ownership change under section 382 and the 
regulations thereunder. The principles of Sec. 1.1502-95A(b) (relating 
to ceasing to be a member of a consolidated group) apply in determining 
whether the loss subgroup parent has an ownership change. Solely for 
purposes of determining whether the loss subgroup parent has an 
ownership change--
    (A) The losses described in Sec. 1.1502-91A(d) are treated as net 
operating losses (or a net unrealized built-in loss) of the loss 
subgroup parent;
    (B) The day that the members of the loss subgroup become members of 
the group (or a loss subgroup) is treated as a testing date within the 
meaning of Sec. 1.382-2(a)(4); and
    (C) The loss subgroup parent determines the earliest day that its 
testing period can begin under Sec. 1.382-2T(d)(3) by reference to only 
the attributes that make the members a loss subgroup under Sec. 1.1502-
91A(d).
    (2) Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of 
this paragraph (b).

    Example 1. Loss group--ownership change of the common parent. (a) A 
owns all the L stock. L owns 80 percent and B owns 20 percent of the L1 
stock. For Year 1, the L group has a consolidated net operating loss 
that resulted from the operations of L1 and that is carried over to Year 
2. The value of the L stock is $1000. The total value of the L1 stock is 
$600 and the value of the L1 stock held by B is $120. The L group is a 
loss group under Sec. 1.1502-91A(c)(1) because it is entitled to use 
its net operating loss carryover from Year 1. On August 15, Year 2, A 
sells 51 percent of the L stock to C. The following is a graphic 
illustration of these facts:

[[Page 597]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27JN96.005

    (b) Under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, section 382 and the 
regulations thereunder are applied to L to determine whether it (and 
therefore the L loss group) has an ownership change with respect to its 
net operating loss carryover from Year 1 attributable to L1 on August 
15, Year 2. The sale of the L stock to C causes an ownership change of L 
under Sec. 1.382-2T and of the L loss group under paragraph (b)(1)(i) 
of this section. The amount of consolidated taxable income of the L loss 
group for any post-change taxable year that may be offset by its pre-
change consolidated attributes (that is, the net operating loss 
carryover from Year 1 attributable to L1) may not exceed the 
consolidated section 382 limitation for the L loss group for the taxable 
year.
    Example 2. Loss group--owner shifts of subsidiaries disregarded  (a) 
The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that on August 15, Year 
2, A sells only 49 percent of the L stock to C and, on December 12, Year 
3, in an unrelated transaction, B sells the 20 percent of the L1 stock 
to D. A's sale of the L stock to C does not cause an ownership change of 
L under Sec. 1.382-2T nor of the L loss group under paragraph (b)(1)(i) 
of this section. The following is a graphic illustration of these facts:

[[Page 598]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27JN96.006

    (b) B's subsequent sale of L1 stock is not taken into account for 
purposes of determining whether the L loss group has an ownership change 
under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, and, accordingly, there is no 
ownership change of the L loss group. See paragraph (c) of this section, 
however, for a supplemental ownership change method that would apply to 
cause an ownership change if the purchases by C and D were pursuant to a 
plan or arrangement.
    Example 3. Loss subgroup--ownership change of loss subgroup parent 
controls. (a) P owns all the L stock. L owns 80 percent and A owns 20 
percent of the L1 stock. The P group has a consolidated net operating 
loss arising in Year 1 that is carried over to Year 2. On September 9, 
Year 2, P sells 51 percent of the L stock to B, and L1 is apportioned a 
portion of the Year 1 consolidated net operating loss under Sec. 
1.1502-21(b) or 1.1502-21T(b) in effect prior to June 25, 1999, as 
contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 1999, as applicable, which 
it carries over to its next taxable year. L and L1 file a consolidated 
return for their first taxable year ending after the sale to B. The 
following is a graphic illustration of these facts:

[[Page 599]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27JN96.007

    (b) Under Sec. 1.1502-91A(d)(1), L and L1 compose a loss subgroup 
on September 9, Year 2, the day that they become members of the L group. 
Under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, section 382 and the 
regulations thereunder are applied to L to determine whether it (and 
therefore the L loss subgroup) has an ownership change with respect to 
the portion of the Year 1 consolidated net operating loss that is 
apportioned to L1 on September 9, Year 2. L has an ownership change 
resulting from P's sale of 51 percent of the L stock to A. Therefore, 
the L loss subgroup has an ownership change with respect to that loss.
    Example 4. Loss group and loss subgroup--contemporaneous ownership 
changes. (a) A owns all the stock of corporation M, M owns 35 percent 
and B owns 65 percent of the L

[[Page 600]]

stock, and L owns all the L1 stock. The L group has a consolidated net 
operating loss arising in Year 1 that is carried over to Year 2. On May 
19, Year 2, B sells 45 percent of the L stock to M for cash. M, L, and 
L1 thereafter file consolidated returns. L and L1 are each apportioned a 
portion of the Year 1 consolidated net operating loss, which they carry 
over to the M group's Year 2 and Year 3 consolidated return years. The M 
group has a consolidated net operating loss arising in Year 2 that is 
carried over to Year 3. On June 9, Year 3, A sells 70 percent of the M 
stock to C. The following is a graphic illustration of these facts:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27JN96.008


[[Page 601]]


    (b) Under Sec. 1.1502-91A(d)(1), L and L1 compose a loss subgroup 
on May 19, Year 2, the day they become members of the M group. Under 
paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, section 382 and the regulations 
thereunder are applied to L to determine whether L (and therefore the L 
loss subgroup) has an ownership change with respect to the loss 
carryovers from Year 1 on May 19, Year 2, a testing date because of B's 
sale of L stock to M. The sale of L stock to M results in only a 45 
percentage point increase in A's ownership of L stock. Thus, there is no 
ownership change of L (or the L loss subgroup) with respect to those 
loss carryovers under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section on that day.
    (c) June 9, Year 3, is also a testing date with respect to the L 
loss subgroup because of A's sale of M stock to C. The sale results in a 
56 percentage point increase in C's ownership of L stock, and L has an 
ownership change. Therefore, the L loss subgroup has an ownership change 
on that day with respect to the loss carryovers from Year 1.
    (d) Paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section requires that section 382 
and the regulations thereunder be applied to M to determine whether M 
(and therefore the M loss group) has an ownership change with respect to 
the net operating loss carryover from Year 2 on June 9, Year 3, a 
testing date because of A's sale of M stock to C. The sale results in a 
70 percentage point increase in C's ownership of M stock, and M has an 
ownership change. Therefore, the M loss group has an ownership change on 
that day with respect to that loss carryover.

    (3) Special adjustments--(i) Common parent succeeded by a new common 
parent. For purposes of determining if a loss group has an ownership 
change, if the common parent of a loss group is succeeded or acquired by 
a new common parent and the loss group remains in existence, the new 
common parent is treated as a continuation of the former common parent 
with appropriate adjustments to take into account shifts in ownership of 
the former common parent during the testing period (including shifts 
that occur incident to the common parent's becoming the former common 
parent).
    (ii) Newly created loss subgroup parent. For purposes of determining 
if a loss subgroup has an ownership change, if the member that is the 
loss subgroup parent has not been the loss subgroup parent for at least 
3 years as of a testing date, appropriate adjustments must be made to 
take into account owner shifts of members of the loss subgroup so that 
the structure of the loss subgroup does not have the effect of avoiding 
an ownership change under section 382. (See paragraph (b)(3)(iii) 
Example 3 of this section.)
    (iii) Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of 
this paragraph (b)(3).

    Example 1. New common parent acquires old common parent. (a) A, who 
owns all the L stock, sells 30 percent of the L stock to B on August 26, 
Year 1. L owns all the L1 stock. The L group has a consolidated net 
operating loss arising in Year 1 that is carried over to Year 3. On July 
16, Year 2, A and B transfer their L stock to a newly created holding 
company, HC, in exchange for 70 percent and 30 percent, respectively, of 
the HC stock. HC, L, and L1 thereafter file consolidated returns. Under 
the principles of Sec. 1.1502-75(d), the L loss group is treated as 
remaining in existence, with HC taking the place of L as the new common 
parent of the loss group. The following is a graphic illustration of 
these facts:

[[Page 602]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27JN96.009

    (b) On November 11, Year 3, A sells 25 percent of the HC stock to B. 
For purposes of determining if the L loss group has an ownership change 
under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section on November 11, Year 3, HC is 
treated as a continuation of L under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section 
because it acquired L and became the common parent

[[Page 603]]

without terminating the L loss group. Accordingly, HC's testing period 
commences on January 1, Year 1, the first day of the taxable year of the 
L loss group in which the consolidated net operating loss that is 
carried over to Year 3 arose (see Sec. 1.382-2T(d)(3)(i)). Immediately 
after the close of November 11, Year 3, B's percentage ownership 
interest in the common parent of the loss group (HC) has increased by 55 
percentage points over its lowest percentage ownership during the 
testing period (zero percent). Accordingly, HC and the L loss group have 
an ownership change on that day.
    Example 2. Common parent in case in which common parent ceases to 
exist. (a) A, B, and C each own one-third of the L stock. L owns all the 
L1 stock. The L group has a consolidated net operating loss arising in 
Year 2 that is carried over to Year 3. On November 22, Year 3, L is 
merged into P, a corporation owned by D, and L1 thereafter files 
consolidated returns with P. A, B, and C, as a result of owning stock of 
L, own 90 percent of P's stock after the merger. D owns the remaining 10 
percent of P's stock. The merger of L into P qualifies as a reverse 
acquisition of the L group under Sec. 1.1502-75(d)(3)(i), and the L 
loss group is treated as remaining in existence, with P taking the place 
of L as the new common parent of the L group. The following is a graphic 
illustration of these facts:

[[Page 604]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27JN96.010

    (b) For purposes of determining if the L loss group has an ownership 
change on November 22, Year 3, the day of the merger, P is treated as a 
continuation of L so that the testing period for P begins on January 1, 
Year 2, the first day of the taxable year of the L loss group in which 
the consolidated net operating loss that is carried over to Year 3 
arose. Immediately after the close of November 22, Year 3, D is the only 
5-percent shareholder that has increased his ownership interest in P 
during the testing period (from zero to 10 percentage points).
    (c) The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this Example 2, 
except that A has held 23\1/3\ shares (23\1/3\ percent) of L's stock for 
five years, and A purchased an additional 10 shares of L stock from E 
two years before the merger. Immediately after the close of the day of 
the merger (a testing date), A's ownership interest in P, the common 
parent of the L loss group, has increased by 6\2/3\ percentage points 
over her lowest percentage

[[Page 605]]

ownership during the testing period (23\1/3\ percent to 30 percent).
    (d) The facts are the same as in (a) of this Example 2, except that 
P has a net operating loss arising in Year 1 that is carried to the 
first consolidated return year ending after the day of the merger. 
Solely for purposes of determining whether the L loss group has an 
ownership change under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, the testing 
period for P commences on January 1, Year 2. P does not determine the 
earliest day for its testing period by reference to its net operating 
loss carryover from Year 1, which Sec. Sec. 1502-1(f)(3) and 1.1502-
75(d)(3)(i) treat as arising in a SRLY. See Sec. 1.1502-94A to 
determine the application of section 382 with respect to P's net 
operating loss carryover.
    Example 3. Newly acquired loss subgroup parent. (a) P owns all the L 
stock and L owns all the L1 stock. The P group has a consolidated net 
operating loss arising in Year 1 that is carried over to Year 3. On 
January 19, Year 2, L issues a 20 percent stock interest to B. On 
February 5, Year 3, P contributes its L stock to a newly formed 
subsidiary, HC, in exchange for all the HC stock, and distributes the HC 
stock to its sole shareholder A. HC, L, and L1 thereafter file 
consolidated returns. A portion of the P group's Year 1 consolidated net 
operating loss is apportioned to L and L1 under Sec. 1.1502-21T(b) and 
is carried over to the HC group's year ending after February 5, Year 3. 
HC, L, and L1 compose a loss subgroup within the meaning of Sec. 
1.1502-91A(d) with respect to the net operating loss carryovers from 
Year 1. The following is a graphic illustration of these facts:

[[Page 606]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27JN96.011

    (b) February 5, Year 3, is a testing date for HC as the loss 
subgroup parent with respect to the net operating loss carryovers of L 
and L1 from Year 1. See paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B) of this section. For 
purposes of determining whether HC has an ownership change on the 
testing date, appropriate adjustments must be made with respect to the 
changes in the percentage ownership of the stock of HC because HC was 
not the loss subgroup parent for at least 3 years prior to the day on 
which it became a member of the HC loss subgroup (a testing date). The 
appropriate adjustments include adjustments so that HC succeeds to the 
owner shifts of other members of the former group. Thus, HC succeeds to 
the owner shift of L that resulted from the sale of the 20 percent 
interest to B in determining whether the HC loss subgroup has an 
ownership change on February 5, Year 3, and

[[Page 607]]

on any subsequent testing date that includes January 19, Year 2.

    (4) End of separate tracking of certain losses. If Sec. 1.1502-
96A(a) (relating to the end of separate tracking of attributes) applies 
to a loss subgroup, then, while one or more members that were included 
in the loss subgroup remain members of the consolidated group, there is 
an ownership change with respect to their attributes described in Sec. 
1.1502-96A(a)(2) only if the consolidated group is a loss group and has 
an ownership change under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section (or such a 
member has an ownership change under Sec. 1.1502-96A(b) (relating to 
ownership changes of subsidiaries)). If, however, the loss subgroup has 
had an ownership change before Sec. 1.1502-96A(a) applies, see Sec. 
1.1502-96A(c) for the continuing application of the subgroup's section 
382 limitation with respect to its pre-change subgroup attributes.
    (c) Supplemental rules for determining ownership change--(1) Scope. 
This paragraph (c) contains a supplemental rule for determining whether 
there is an ownership change of a loss group (or loss subgroup). It 
applies in addition to, and not instead of, the rules of paragraph (b) 
of this section. Thus, for example, if the common parent of the loss 
group has an ownership change under paragraph (b) of this section, the 
loss group has an ownership change even if, by applying this paragraph 
(c), the common parent would not have an ownership change.
    (2) Cause for applying supplemental rule. This paragraph (c) applies 
to a loss group (or loss subgroup) if--
    (i) Any 5-percent shareholder of the common parent (or loss subgroup 
parent) increases its percentage ownership interest in the stock of 
both--
    (A) A subsidiary of the loss group (or loss subgroup) other than by 
a direct or indirect acquisition of stock of the common parent (or loss 
subgroup parent); and
    (B) The common parent (or loss subgroup parent); and
    (ii) Those increases occur within a 3 year period ending on any day 
of a consolidated return year or, if shorter, the period beginning on 
the first day following the most recent ownership change of the loss 
group (or loss subgroup).
    (3) Operating rules. Solely for purposes of this paragraph (c)--
    (i) A 5-percent shareholder of the common parent (or loss subgroup 
parent) is treated as increasing its percentage ownership interest in 
the common parent (or loss subgroup parent) or a subsidiary to the 
extent, if any, that any person acting pursuant to a plan or arrangement 
with the 5-percent shareholder increases its percentage ownership 
interest in the stock of that entity;
    (ii) The rules in section 382(l)(3) and Sec. Sec. 1.382-2T(h) and 
1.382-4(d) (relating to constructive ownership) apply with respect to 
the stock of the subsidiary by treating such stock as stock of a loss 
corporation; and
    (iii) In the case of a loss subgroup, a subsidiary includes any 
member of the loss subgroup other than the loss subgroup parent. (The 
loss subgroup parent is, however, a subsidiary of the loss group of 
which it is a member.)
    (4) Supplemental ownership change rules. The determination whether 
the common parent (or loss subgroup parent) has an ownership change is 
made by applying paragraph (b)(1) of this section as modified by the 
following additional rules--
    (i) Additional testing dates for the common parent (or loss subgroup 
parent). A testing date for the common parent (or loss subgroup parent) 
also includes--
    (A) Each day on which there is an increase in the percentage 
ownership of stock of a subsidiary as described in paragraph (c)(2) of 
this section; and
    (B) The first day of the first consolidated return year for which 
the group is a loss group (or the members compose a loss subgroup);
    (ii) Treatment of subsidiary stock as stock of the common parent (or 
loss subgroup parent). The common parent (or loss subgroup parent) is 
treated as though it had issued to the person acquiring (or deemed to 
acquire) the subsidiary stock an amount of its own stock (by value) that 
equals the value of the subsidiary stock represented by the percentage 
increase in that person's ownership of the subsidiary (determined on a 
separate entity basis). A similar principle applies if the increase

[[Page 608]]

in percentage ownership interest is effected by a redemption or similar 
transaction; and
    (iii) 5-percent shareholder of the common parent (or loss subgroup 
parent). Any person described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section who 
is acting pursuant to the plan or arrangement is treated as a 5-percent 
shareholder of the common parent (or loss subgroup parent).
    (5) Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of 
this paragraph (c).

    Example 1. Stock of the common parent under supplemental rules. (a) 
A owns all the L stock. L is not a member of an affiliated group and has 
a net operating loss carryover arising in Year 1 that is carried over to 
Year 6. On September 20, Year 6, L transfers all of its assets and 
liabilities to a newly created subsidiary, S, in exchange for S stock. L 
and S thereafter file consolidated returns. On November 23, Year 6, B 
contributes cash to L in exchange for a 45 percent ownership interest in 
L and contributes cash to S for a 20 percent ownership interest in S.
    (b) B is a 5-percent shareholder of L who increases his percentage 
ownership interest in L and S during the 3 year period ending on 
November 23, Year 6. Under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, the 
determination whether L (the common parent of a loss group) has an 
ownership change on November 23, Year 6 (or on any testing date in the 
testing period which includes November 23, Year 6), is made by applying 
paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section and by treating the value of B's 20 
percent ownership interest in S as if it were L stock issued to B.
    Example 2. Plan or arrangement--public offering of subsidiary stock. 
(a) A owns all the stock of L and L owns all the stock of L1. The L 
group has a consolidated net operating loss arising in Year 1 that 
resulted from the operations of L1 and that is carried over to Year 2. 
As part of a plan, A sells 49 percent of the L stock to B on October 7, 
Year 2, and L1 issues new stock representing a 20 percent ownership 
interest in L1 to the public on November 6, Year 2. The following is a 
graphic illustration of these facts:

[[Page 609]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27JN96.012

    (b) A's sale of the L stock to B does not cause an ownership change 
of the L loss group on October 7, Year 2, under the rules of Sec. 
1.382-2T and paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.
    (c) Because the issuance of L1 stock to the public occurs in 
connection with B's acquisition of L stock pursuant to a plan, paragraph 
(c)(4) of this section applies to determine whether the L loss group has 
an ownership change on November 6, Year 2 (or on any testing date for 
which the testing period includes November 6, Year 2).

    (d) Testing period following ownership change under this section. If 
a loss group (or a loss subgroup) has had an ownership change under this 
section, the

[[Page 610]]

testing period for determining a subsequent ownership change with 
respect to pre-change consolidated attributes (or pre-change subgroup 
attributes) begins no earlier than the first day following the loss 
group's (or loss subgroup's) most recent change date.
    (e) Information statements.--(1) Common parent of a loss group. The 
common parent of a loss group must file the information statement 
required by Sec. 1.382-2T(a)(2)(ii) for a consolidated return year 
because of any owner shift, equity structure shift, or the issuance or 
transfer of an option--
    (i) With respect to the common parent and with respect to any 
subsidiary stock subject to paragraph (c) of this section; and
    (ii) With respect to an ownership change described in Sec. 1.1502-
96A(b) (relating to ownership changes of subsidiaries).
    (2) Abbreviated statement with respect to loss subgroups. The common 
parent of a consolidated group that has a loss subgroup during a 
consolidated return year must file the information statement required by 
Sec. 1.382-2T(a)(2)(ii) because of any owner shift, equity structure 
shift, or issuance or transfer of an option with respect to the loss 
subgroup parent and with respect to any subsidiary stock subject to 
paragraph (c) of this section. Instead of filing a separate statement 
for each loss subgroup parent, the common parent (which is treated as a 
loss corporation) may file the single statement described in paragraph 
(e)(1) of this section. In addition to the information concerning stock 
ownership of the common parent, the single statement must identify each 
loss subgroup parent and state which loss subgroups, if any, have had 
ownership changes during the consolidated return year. The loss subgroup 
parent is, however, still required to maintain the records necessary to 
determine if the loss subgroup has an ownership change. This paragraph 
(e)(2) applies with respect to the attributes of a loss subgroup until, 
under Sec. 1.1502-96A(a), the attributes are no longer treated as 
described in Sec. 1.1502-91A(d) (relating to the definition of loss 
subgroup). After that time, the information statement described in 
paragraph (e)(1) of this section must be filed with respect to those 
attributes.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1502-93A  Consolidated section 382 limitation (or subgroup section 
382 limitation) generally applicable for testing dates before June 25, 1999.

    (a) Determination of the consolidated section 382 limitation (or 
subgroup section 382 limitation)--(1) In general. Following an ownership 
change, the consolidated section 382 limitation (or subgroup section 382 
limitation) for any post-change year is an amount equal to the value of 
the loss group (or loss subgroup), as defined in paragraph (b) of this 
section, multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate that applies with 
respect to the ownership change, and adjusted as required by section 382 
and the regulations thereunder. See, for example, section 382(b)(2) 
(relating to the carryforward of unused section 382 limitation), section 
382(b)(3)(B) (relating to the section 382 limitation for the post-change 
year that includes the change date), section 382(m)(2) (relating to 
short taxable years), and section 382(h) (relating to recognized built-
in gains and section 338 gains).
    (2) Coordination with apportionment rule. For special rules relating 
to apportionment of a consolidated section 382 limitation (or a subgroup 
section 382 limitation) when one or more corporations cease to be 
members of a loss group (or a loss subgroup) and to aggregation of 
amounts so apportioned, see Sec. 1.1502-95A(c).
    (b) Value of the loss group (or loss subgroup)--(1) Stock value 
immediately before ownership change. Subject to any adjustment under 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the value of the loss group (or loss 
subgroup) is the value, immediately before the ownership change, of the 
stock of each member, other than stock that is owned directly or 
indirectly by another member. For this purpose--
    (i) Ownership is determined under Sec. 1.382-2T;
    (ii) A member is considered to indirectly own stock of another 
member

[[Page 611]]

through a nonmember only if the member has a 5-percent or greater 
ownership interest in the nonmember; and
    (iii) Stock includes stock described in section 1504(a)(4) and Sec. 
1.382-2T(f)(18)(ii) and (iii).
    (2) Adjustment to value. The value of the loss group (or loss 
subgroup), as determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, is 
adjusted under any rule in section 382 or the regulations thereunder 
requiring an adjustment to such value for purposes of computing the 
amount of the section 382 limitation. See, for example, section 
382(e)(2) (redemptions and corporate contractions), section 382(l)(1) 
(certain capital contributions) and section 382(l)(4) (ownership of 
substantial nonbusiness assets). The value of the loss group (or loss 
subgroup) determined under this paragraph (b) is also adjusted to the 
extent necessary to prevent any duplication of the value of the stock of 
a member. For example, the principles of Sec. 1.382-8 (relating to 
controlled groups of corporations) apply in determining the value of a 
loss group (or loss subgroup) if, under Sec. 1.1502-91A(g)(2), members 
are not included in the determination whether the group (or loss 
subgroup) has a net unrealized built-in loss.
    (3) Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of 
this paragraph (b).

    Example 1. Basic case. (a) L, L1, and L2 compose a loss group. L has 
outstanding common stock, the value of which is $100. L1 has outstanding 
common stock and preferred stock that is described in section 
1504(a)(4). L owns 90 percent of the L1 common stock, and A owns the 
remaining 10 percent of the L1 common stock plus all the preferred 
stock. The value of the L1 common stock is $40, and the value of the L1 
preferred stock is $30. L2 has outstanding common stock, 50 percent of 
which is owned by L and 50 percent by L1. The L group has an ownership 
change. The following is a graphic illustration of these facts:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27JN96.013

    (b) Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the L group does not 
include the value of the stock of any member that is owned directly or 
indirectly by another member in computing its consolidated section 382 
limitation. Accordingly, the value of the stock of the loss group is 
$134, the sum of the value of--
    (1) The common stock of L ($100);
    (2) the 10 percent of the L1 common stock ($4) owned by A; and
    (3) The L1 preferred stock ($30) owned by A.
    Example 2. Indirect ownership. (a) L and L1 compose a consolidated 
group. L's stock has a value of $100. L owns 80 shares (worth $80) and 
corporation M owns 20 shares (worth $20) of the L1 stock. L also owns 79 
percent of the stock of corporation M. The L group has an ownership 
change. The following is a graphic illustration of these facts:

[[Page 612]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27JN96.014

    (b) Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, because of L's more than 
5 percent ownership interest in M, a nonmember, L is considered to 
indirectly own 15.8 shares of the L1 stock held by M (79% x 20 shares). 
The value of the L loss group is $104.20, the sum of the values of--
    (1) The L stock ($100); and
    (2) The L1 stock not owned directly or indirectly by L (21% x $20, 
or $4.20).

    (c) Recognized built-in gain of a loss group or loss subgroup. If a 
loss group (or loss subgroup) has a net unrealized built-in gain, any 
recognized built-in gain of the loss group (or loss subgroup) is taken 
into account under section 382(h) in determining the consolidated 
section 382 limitation (or subgroup section 382 limitation). See Sec. 
1.1502-99A(a)(2) for a special rule relating to the application of Sec. 
1.502-93(c)(2) to consolidated return years for which the due date of 
the return is after June 25, 1999.
    (d) Continuity of business--(1) In general. A loss group (or a loss 
subgroup) is treated as a single entity for purposes of determining 
whether it satisfies the continuity of business enterprise requirement 
of section 382(c)(1).
    (2) Example. The following example illustrates the principle of this 
paragraph (d).
    Example. Continuity of business enterprise. L owns all the stock of 
two subsidiaries, L1 and L2. The L group has an ownership change. It has 
pre-change consolidated attributes attributable to L2. Each of the 
members has historically conducted a separate line of business. Each 
line of business is approximately equal in value. One year after the 
ownership change, L discontinues its separate business and the business 
of L2. The separate business of L1 is continued for the remainder of the 
2 year period following the ownership change. The continuity of business 
enterprise requirement of section 382(c)(1) is met even though the 
separate businesses of L and L2 are discontinued.

    (e) Limitations of losses under other rules. If a section 382 
limitation for a post-change year exceeds the consolidated taxable 
income that may be offset by pre-change attributes for any reason, 
including the application of the limitation of Sec. 1.1502-21(c) or 
1.1502-21T(c) in effect prior to June 25, 1999, as contained in 26 CFR 
part 1 revised April 1, 1999, as applicable, the amount of the excess is 
carried forward under section 382(b)(2) (relating to the carryforward of 
unused section 382 limitation).

<R05>
Sec. 1.1502-94A  Coordination with section 382 and the regulations 

thereunder when a corporation becomes a member of a consolidated group) 
generally applicable for corporations becoming members of a group before 
June 25, 1999.

    (a) Scope--(1) In general. This section applies section 382 and the 
regulations thereunder to a corporation that is a new loss member of a 
consolidated group. A corporation is a new loss member if it--
    (i) Carries over a net operating loss that arose (or is treated 
under Sec. 1.1502-21(c) or 1.1502-21T(c) in effect prior to June 25, 
1999, as contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 1999, as 
applicable, as arising) in a SRLY with respect to the current group, and 
that is not described in Sec. 1.1502-91A(d)(1); or
    (ii) Has a net unrealized built-in loss (determined under paragraph 
(c) of this section on the day it becomes a member of the current group 
by treating that day as a change date) that is not taken into account 
under Sec. 1.1502-91A(d)(2) in determining whether two or more 
corporations compose a loss subgroup.
    (2) Successor corporation as new loss member. A new loss member also 
includes any successor to a corporation that has a net operating loss 
carryover arising in a SRLY and that is treated as remaining in 
existence under Sec. 1.382-2(a)(1)(ii) following a transaction 
described in section 381(a).
    (3) Coordination in the case of a loss subgroup. For rules regarding 
the determination of whether there is an ownership change of a loss 
subgroup with respect to a net operating loss or a net unrealized built-
in loss described in Sec. 1.1502-91A(d) (relating to the definition of 
loss subgroup) and the computation of a subgroup section 382 limitation 
following such an ownership change, see Sec. Sec. 1.1502-92A and 
1.1502-93A.
    (4) End of separate tracking of certain losses. If Sec. 1.1502-
96A(a) (relating to the end of separate tracking of attributes) applies 
to a new loss member, then, while that member remains a member of the 
consolidated group, there is an ownership change with respect to its 
attributes described in Sec. 1.1502-96A(a)(2) only if the consolidated 
group is a loss group and has an ownership change under Sec. 1.1502-
92A(b)(1)(i) (or that member has an ownership change under Sec. 1.1502-
96A(b) (relating to ownership changes of subsidiaries)). If, however, 
the new loss member has had an ownership change before Sec. 1.1502-
96A(a) applies, see Sec. 1.1502-96A(c) for the continuing application 
of the section 382 limitation with respect to the member's pre-change 
losses.
    (5) Cross-reference. See section 382(a) and Sec. 1.1502-96A(c) for 
the continuing effect of an ownership change after a corporation becomes 
or ceases to be a member.
    (b) Application of section 382 to a new loss member--(1) In general. 
Section 382 and the regulations thereunder apply to a new loss member to 
determine, on a separate entity basis, whether and to what extent a 
section 382 limitation applies to limit the amount of consolidated 
taxable income that may be offset by the new loss member's pre-change 
separate attributes. For example, if an ownership change with respect to 
the new loss member occurs under section 382 and the regulations 
thereunder, the amount of consolidated taxable income for any post-
change year that may be offset by the new loss member's pre-change 
separate attributes shall not exceed the section 382 limitation as 
determined separately under section 382(b) with respect to that member 
for such year. If the post-change year includes the change date, section 
382(b)(3)(A) is applied so that the section 382 limitation of the new 
loss member does not apply to the portion of the taxable income for such 
year that is allocable to the period in such year on or before the 
change date. See generally Sec. 1.382-6 (relating to the allocation of 
income and loss).
    (2) Adjustment to value. The value of the new loss member is 
adjusted to the extent necessary to prevent any duplication of the value 
of the stock of a member. For example, the principles of Sec. 1.382-8T 
(relating to controlled groups of corporations) apply in determining the 
value of a new loss member.
    (3) Pre-change separate attribute defined. A pre-change separate 
attribute of a new loss member is--
    (i) Any net operating loss carryover of the new loss member 
described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section; and

[[Page 614]]

    (ii) Any recognized built-in loss of the new loss member.
    (4) Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of 
this paragraph (b).

    Example 1. Basic case. (a) A and P each own 50 percent of the L 
stock. On December 19, Year 6, P purchases 30 percent of the L stock 
from A for cash. L has net operating losses arising in Year 1 and Year 2 
that it carries over to Year 6 and Year 7. The following is a graphic 
illustration of these facts:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27JN96.015

    (b) L is a new loss member because it has net operating loss 
carryovers that arose in a SRLY with respect to the P group and L is not 
a member of a loss subgroup under Sec. 1.1502-91A(d). Under section 382 
and the regulations thereunder, L is a loss corporation on December 19, 
Year 6, that day is a testing date for L, and the testing period for L 
commences on December 20, Year 3.

[[Page 615]]

    (c) P's purchase of L stock does not cause an ownership change of L 
on December 19, Year 6, with respect to the net operating loss 
carryovers from Year 1 and Year 2 under section 382 and Sec. 1.382-2T. 
The use of the loss carryovers, however, is subject to limitation under 
Sec. 1.1502-21(c) or 1.1502-21T(c) in effect prior to June 25, 1999, as 
contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 1999, as applicable.
    Example 2. Multiple new loss members. (a) The facts are the same as 
in Example 1, and, on December 31, Year 6, L purchases all the stock of 
L1 from B for cash. L1 has a net operating loss of $40 arising in Year 3 
that it carries over to Year 7. The following is a graphic illustration 
of these facts:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27JN96.016


[[Page 616]]


    (b) L1 is a new loss member because it has a net operating loss 
carryover from Year 3 that arose in a SRLY with respect to the P group 
and L1 is not a member of a loss subgroup under Sec. 1.1502-91A(d)(1).
    (c) L's purchase of all the stock of L1 causes an ownership change 
of L1 on December 31, Year 6, under section 382 and Sec. 1.382-2T. 
Accordingly, a section 382 limitation based on the value of the L1 stock 
immediately before the ownership change limits the amount of 
consolidated taxable income of the P group for any post-change year that 
may be offset by L1's loss from Year 3.
    (d) L1's ownership change in connection with its becoming a member 
of the P group is an ownership change described in Sec. 1.1502-96A(a). 
Thus, starting on January 1, Year 7, the P group no longer separately 
tracks owner shifts of the stock of L1 with respect to L1's loss from 
Year 3. Instead, the P group is a loss group because of such loss under 
Sec. 1.1502-91A(c).
    Example 3. Ownership changes of new loss members. (a) The facts are 
the same as in Example 2, and, on April 30, Year 7, C purchases all the 
stock of P for cash.
    (b) L is a new loss member on April 30, Year 7, because its Year 1 
and Year 2 losses arose in SRLYs with respect to the P group and it is 
not a member of a loss subgroup under Sec. 1.1502-91A(d)(1). The 
testing period for L commences on May 1, Year 4. C's purchase of all the 
P stock causes an ownership change of L on April 30, Year 7, under 
section 382 and Sec. 1.382-2T with respect to its Year 1 and Year 2 
losses. Accordingly, a section 382 limitation based on the value of the 
L stock immediately before the ownership change limits the amount of 
consolidated taxable income of the P group for any post-change year that 
may be offset by L's Year 1 and Year 2 losses. See also Sec. 1.1502-21T 
in effect prior to June 25, 1999, contained in 26 CFR Part 1, revised 
April 1, 1999, or Sec. 1.1502-21, as applicable.
    (c) The P group is a loss group on April 30, Year 7, because it is 
entitled to use L1's loss from Year 3, and such loss is no longer 
treated as a loss of a new loss member starting the day after L1's 
ownership change on December 31, Year 6. See Sec. Sec. 1.1502-96A(a) 
and 1.1502-91A(c)(2). C's purchase of all the P stock causes an 
ownership change of P, and therefore the P loss group, on April 30, Year 
7, with respect to L1's Year 3 loss. Accordingly, a consolidated section 
382 limitation based on the value of the P stock immediately before the 
ownership change limits the amount of consolidated taxable income of the 
P group for any post-change year that may be offset by L1's Year 3 loss.

    (c) Built-in gains and losses. As the context may require, the 
principles of Sec. Sec. 1.1502-91A(g) and (h) and 1.1502-93A(c) 
(relating to built-in gains and losses) apply to a new loss member on a 
separate entity basis. See Sec. 1.1502-91A(g)(3).
    (d) Information statements. The common parent of a consolidated 
group that has a new loss member subject to paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section during a consolidated return year must file the information 
statement required by Sec. 1.382-2T(a)(2)(ii) because of any owner 
shift, equity structure shift, or issuance or transfer of an option with 
respect to the new loss member. Instead of filing a separate statement 
for each new loss member the common parent may file a single statement 
described in Sec. 1.382-2T(a)(2)(ii) with respect to the stock 
ownership of the common parent (which is treated as a loss corporation). 
In addition to the information concerning stock ownership of the common 
parent, the single statement must identify each new loss member and 
state which new loss members, if any, have had ownership changes during 
the consolidated return year. The new loss member is, however, required 
to maintain the records necessary to determine if it has an ownership 
change. This paragraph (d) applies with respect to the attributes of a 
new loss member until an event occurs which ends separate tracking under 
Sec. 1.1502-96A(a). After that time, the information statement 
described in Sec. 1.1502-92A(e)(1) must be filed with respect to these 
attributes.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1502-95A  Rules on ceasing to be a member of a consolidated group 
generally applicable for corporations ceasing to be members before June 25, 1999.

    (a) In general--(1) Consolidated group. This section provides rules 
for applying section 382 on or after the day that a member ceases to be 
a member of a consolidated group (or loss subgroup). The rules concern 
how to determine whether an ownership change occurs with respect to 
losses of the member, and how a consolidated section 382 limitation (or 
subgroup section 382 limitation) is apportioned to the member. As the 
context requires, a reference in this section to a loss group, a member, 
or a

[[Page 617]]

corporation also includes a reference to a loss subgroup, and a 
reference to a consolidated section 382 limitation also includes a 
reference to a subgroup section 382 limitation.
    (2) Election by common parent. Only the common parent (not the loss 
subgroup parent) may make the election under paragraph (c) of this 
section to apportion either a consolidated section 382 limitation or a 
subgroup section 382 limitation.
    (3) Coordination with Sec. Sec. 1.1502-91A through 1.1502-93A. For 
rules regarding the determination of whether there is an ownership 
change of a loss subgroup and the computation of a subgroup section 382 
limitation following such an ownership change, see Sec. Sec. 1.1502-91A 
through 1.1502-93A.
    (b) Separate application of section 382 when a member leaves a 
consolidated group--(1) In general. Except as provided in Sec. Sec. 
1.1502-91A through 1.1502-93A (relating to rules applicable to loss 
groups and loss subgroups), section 382 and the regulations thereunder 
apply to a corporation on a separate entity basis after it ceases to be 
a member of a consolidated group (or loss subgroup). Solely for purposes 
of determining whether a corporation has an ownership change--
    (i) Any portion of a consolidated net operating loss that is 
apportioned to the corporation under Sec. 1.1502-21(b) or 1.1502-21T(b) 
in effect prior to June 25, 1999, as contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised 
April 1, 1999, as applicable is treated as a net operating loss of the 
corporation beginning on the first day of the taxable year in which the 
loss arose;
    (ii) The testing period may include the period during which (or 
before which) the corporation was a member of the group (or loss 
subgroup); and
    (iii) Except to the extent provided in Sec. 1.1502-20(g) (relating 
to reattributed losses), the day it ceases to be a member of a 
consolidated group is treated as a testing date of the corporation 
within the meaning of Sec. 1.382-2(a)(4).
    (2) Effect of a prior ownership change of the group. If a loss group 
has had an ownership change under Sec. 1.1502-92A before a corporation 
ceases to be a member of a consolidated group (the former member)--
    (i) Any pre-change consolidated attribute that is subject to a 
consolidated section 382 limitation continues to be treated as a pre-
change loss with respect to the former member after the attribute is 
apportioned to the former member;
    (ii) The former member's section 382 limitation with respect to such 
attribute is zero except to the extent the common parent apportions 
under paragraph (c) of this section all or a part of the consolidated 
section 382 limitation to the former member;
    (iii) The testing period for determining a subsequent ownership 
change with respect to such attribute begins no earlier than the first 
day following the loss group's most recent change date; and
    (iv) As generally provided under section 382, an ownership change of 
the former member that occurs on or after the day it ceases to be a 
member of a loss group may result in an additional, lesser limitation 
amount with respect to such loss.
    (3) Application in the case of a loss subgroup. If two or more 
former members are included in the same loss subgroup immediately after 
they cease to be members of a consolidated group, the principles of 
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section apply to the loss subgroup. 
Therefore, for example, an apportionment by the common parent under 
paragraph (c) of this section is made to the loss subgroup rather than 
separately to its members. -
    (4) Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of 
this paragraph (b).

    Example 1. Treatment of departing member as a separate corporation 
throughout the testing period. (a) A owns all the L stock. L owns all 
the stock of L1 and L2. The L group has a consolidated net operating 
loss arising in Year 1 that is carried over to Year 3. On January 12, 
Year 2, A sells 30 percent of the L stock to B. On February 7, Year 3, L 
sells 40 percent of the L2 stock to C, and L2 ceases to be a member of 
the group. A portion of the Year 1 consolidated net operating loss is 
apportioned to L2 under Sec. 1.1502-21(b) or 1.1502-21T(b) in effect 
prior to June 25, 1999, as contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 
1999, as applicable and is carried to L2's first separate return year, 
which ends December 31, Year 3. The following is a graphic illustration 
of these facts:

[[Page 618]]

    (b) Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, L2 is a loss corporation 
on February 7, Year 3. Under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, 
February 7, Year 3, is a testing date. Under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of 
this section, the testing period for L2 with respect to this testing 
date commences on January 1, Year 1, the first day of the taxable year 
in which the

[[Page 619]]

portion of the consolidated net operating loss apportioned to L2 arose. 
Therefore, in determining whether L2 has an ownership change on February 
7, Year 3, B's purchase of 30 percent of the L stock and C's purchase of 
40 percent of the L2 stock are each owner shifts. L2 has an ownership 
change under section 382(g) and Sec. 1.382-2T because B and C have 
increased their ownership interests in L2 by 18 and 40 percentage 
points, respectively, during the testing period.
    Example 2. Effect of prior ownership change of loss group. (a) L 
owns all the L1 stock and L1 owns all the L2 stock. The L loss group had 
an ownership change under Sec. 1.1502-92A in Year 2 with respect to a 
consolidated net operating loss arising in Year 1 and carried over to 
Year 2 and Year 3. The consolidated section 382 limitation computed 
solely on the basis of the value of the stock of L is $100. On December 
31, Year 2, L1 sells 25 percent of the stock of L2 to B. L2 is 
apportioned a portion of the Year 1 consolidated net operating loss 
which it carries over to its first separate return year ending after 
December 31, Year 2. L2's separate section 382 limitation with respect 
to this loss is zero unless L elects to apportion all or a part of the 
consolidated section 382 limitation to L2. (See paragraph (c) of this 
section for rules regarding the apportionment of a consolidated section 
382 limitation.) L apportions $50 of the consolidated section 382 
limitation to L2.
    (b) On December 31, Year 3, L1 sells its remaining 75 percent stock 
interest in L2 to C, resulting in an ownership change of L2. L2's 
section 382 limitation computed on the change date with respect to the 
value of its stock is $30. Accordingly, L2's section 382 limitation for 
post-change years ending after December 31, Year 3, with respect to its 
pre-change losses, including the consolidated net operating losses 
apportioned to it from the L group, is $30, adjusted as required by 
section 382 and the regulations thereunder.

    (c) Apportionment of a consolidated section 382 limitation--(1) In 
general. The common parent may elect to apportion all or any part of a 
consolidated section 382 limitation to a former member (or loss 
subgroup). See paragraph (e) of this section for the time and manner of 
making the election to apportion.
    (2) Amount of apportionment. The common parent may apportion all or 
part of each element of the consolidated section 382 limitation 
determined under Sec. 1.1502-93A. For this purpose, the consolidated 
section 382 limitation consists of two elements--
    (i) The value element, which is the element of the limitation 
determined under section 382(b)(1) (relating to value multiplied by the 
long-term tax-exempt rate) without regard to such adjustments as those 
described in section 382(b)(2) (relating to the carryforward of unused 
section 382 limitation), section 382(b)(3)(B) (relating to the section 
382 limitation for the post-change year that includes the change date), 
section 382(h) (relating to built-in gains and section 338 gains), and 
section 382(m)(2) (relating to short taxable years); and
    (ii) The adjustment element, which is so much (if any) of the 
limitation for the taxable year during which the former member ceases to 
be a member of the consolidated group that is attributable to a 
carryover of unused limitation under section 382(b)(2) or to recognized 
built-in gains under 382(h).
    (3) Effect of apportionment on the consolidated section 382 
limitation. The value element of the consolidated section 382 limitation 
for any post-change year ending after the day that a former member (or 
loss subgroup) ceases to be a member(s) is reduced to the extent that it 
is apportioned under this paragraph (c). The consolidated section 382 
limitation for the post-change year in which the former member (or loss 
subgroup) ceases to be a member(s) is also reduced to the extent that 
the adjustment element for that year is apportioned under this paragraph 
(c).
    (4) Effect on corporations to which the consolidated section 382 
limitation is apportioned. The amount of the value element that is 
apportioned to a former member (or loss subgroup) is treated as the 
amount determined under section 382(b)(1) for purposes of determining 
the amount of that corporation's (or loss subgroup's) section 382 
limitation for any taxable year ending after the former member (or loss 
subgroup) ceases to be a member(s). Appropriate adjustments must be made 
to the limitation based on the value element so apportioned for a short 
taxable year, carryforward of unused limitation, or any other adjustment 
required under section 382. The adjustment element apportioned to a 
former member (or loss subgroup) is treated as an adjustment under 
section 382(b)(2) or section

[[Page 620]]

382(h), as appropriate, for the first taxable year after the member (or 
members) ceases to be a member (or members).
    (5) Deemed apportionment when loss group terminates. If a loss group 
terminates, to the extent the consolidated section 382 limitation is not 
apportioned under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the consolidated 
section 382 limitation is deemed to be apportioned to the loss subgroup 
that includes the common parent, or, if there is no loss subgroup that 
includes the common parent immediately after the loss group terminates, 
to the common parent. A loss group terminates on the first day of the 
first taxable year that is a separate return year with respect to each 
member of the former loss group.
    (6) Appropriate adjustments when former member leaves during the 
year. Appropriate adjustments are made to the consolidated section 382 
limitation for the consolidated return year during which the former 
member (or loss subgroup) ceases to be a member(s) to reflect the 
inclusion of the former member in the loss group for a portion of that 
year.
    (7) Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of 
this paragraph (c).

    Example 1. Consequence of apportionment. (a) L owns all the L1 stock 
and L1 owns all the L2 stock. The L group has a $200 consolidated net 
operating loss arising in Year 1 that is carried over to Year 2. At the 
close of December 31, Year 1, the group has an ownership change under 
Sec. 1.1502-92A. The ownership change results in a consolidated section 
382 limitation of $10 based on the value of the stock of the group. On 
August 29, Year 2, L1 sells 30 percent of the stock of L2 to A. L2 is 
apportioned $90 of the group's $200 consolidated net operating loss 
under Sec. 1.1502-21(b) or 1.1502-21T(b) in effect prior to June 25, 
1999, as contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 1999, as 
applicable. L, the common parent, elects to apportion $6 of the 
consolidated section 382 limitation to L2. The following is a graphic 
illustration of these facts:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27JN96.018

    (b) For its separate return years ending after August 29, Year 2 
(other than the taxable year ending December 31, Year 2), L2's section 
382 limitation with respect to the $90 of the group's net operating loss 
apportioned to it is $6, adjusted, as appropriate, for any short taxable 
year, unused section 382 limitation, or other adjustment. For its 
consolidated return years ending after August 29, Year 2, (other than 
the year ending December 31, Year 2) the L group's consolidated section 
382 limitation with respect to the remaining $110 of pre-change 
consolidated attribute is $4 ($10 minus the $6 value element apportioned 
to L2), adjusted, as appropriate, for any short taxable year, unused 
section 382 limitation, or other adjustment.

[[Page 621]]

    (c) For the L group's consolidated return year ending December 31, 
Year 2, the value element of its consolidated section 382 limitation is 
increased by $4 (rounded to the nearest dollar), to account for the 
period during which L2 was a member of the L group ($6, the consolidated 
section 382 limitation apportioned to L2, times 241/365, the ratio of 
the number of days during Year 2 that L2 is a member of the group to the 
number of days in the group's consolidated return year). See paragraph 
(c)(6) of this section. Therefore, the value element of the consolidated 
section 382 limitation for Year 2 of the L group is $8 (rounded to the 
nearest dollar).
    (d) The section 382 limitation for L2's short taxable year ending 
December 31, Year 2, is $2 (rounded to the nearest dollar), which is the 
amount that bears the same relationship to $6, the value element of the 
consolidated section 382 limitation apportioned to L2, as the number of 
days during that short taxable year, 124 days, bears to 365. See Sec. 
1.382-4(c).
    Example 2. Consequence of no apportionment. The facts are the same 
as in Example 1, except that L does not elect to apportion any portion 
of the consolidated section 382 limitation to L2. For its separate 
return years ending after August 29, Year 2, L2's section 382 limitation 
with respect to the $90 of the group's pre-change consolidated attribute 
apportioned to L2 is zero under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. 
Thus, the $90 consolidated net operating loss apportioned to L2 cannot 
offset L2's taxable income in any of its separate return years ending 
after August 29, Year 2. For its consolidated return years ending after 
August 29, Year 2, the L group's consolidated section 382 limitation 
with respect to the remaining $110 of pre-change consolidated attribute 
is $10, adjusted, as appropriate, for any short taxable year, unused 
section 382 limitation, or other adjustment.
    Example 3. Apportionment of adjustment element. The facts are the 
same as in Example 1, except that L2 ceases to be a member of the L 
group on August 29, Year 3, and the L group has a $4 carryforward of an 
unused consolidated section 382 limitation (under section 382(b)(2)) to 
the 1993 consolidated return year.
    The carryover of unused limitation increases the consolidated 
section 382 limitation for the Year 3 consolidated return year from $10 
to $14. L may elect to apportion all or any portion of the $10 value 
element and all or any portion of the $4 adjustment element to L2.

    (d) Rules pertaining to ceasing to be a member of a loss subgroup--
(1) In general. A corporation ceases to be a member of a loss subgroup--
    (i) On the first day of the first taxable year for which it files a 
separate return; or
    (ii) The first day that it ceases to bear a relationship described 
in section 1504(a)(1) to the loss subgroup parent (treating for this 
purpose the loss subgroup parent as the common parent described in 
section 1504(a)(1)(A)).
    (2) Examples. The principles of this paragraph (d) are illustrated 
by the following examples.

    Example 1. Basic case. (a) P owns all the L stock, L owns all the L1 
stock and L1 owns all the L2 stock. The P group has a consolidated net 
operating loss arising in Year 1 that is carried over to Year 2. On 
December 11, Year 2, P sells all the stock of L to corporation M. Each 
of L, L1, and L2 is apportioned a portion of the Year 1 consolidated net 
operating loss, and thereafter each joins with M in filing consolidated 
returns. Under Sec. 1.1502-92A, the L loss subgroup has an ownership 
change on December 11, Year 2. The L loss subgroup has a subgroup 
section 382 limitation of $100. The following is a graphic illustration 
of these facts:

[[Page 622]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27JN96.019

    (b) On May 22, Year 3, L1 sells 40 percent of the L2 stock to A. L2 
carries over a portion of the P group's net operating loss from Year 1 
to its separate return year ending December 31, Year 3. Under paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section, L2 ceases to be a member of the L loss subgroup 
on May 22, Year 3, which is both (1) the first day of the first taxable 
year

[[Page 623]]

for which it files a separate return and (2) the day it ceases to bear a 
relationship described in section 1504(a)(1) to the loss subgroup 
parent, L. The net operating loss of L2 that is carried over from the P 
group is treated as a pre-change loss of L2 for its separate return 
years ending after May 22, Year 3. Under paragraphs (a)(2) and (b)(2) of 
this section, the separate section 382 limitation with respect to this 
loss is zero unless M elects to apportion all or a part of the subgroup 
section 382 limitation of the L loss subgroup to L2.
    Example 2. Formation of a new loss subgroup. The facts are the same 
as in Example 1, except that A purchases 40 percent of the L1 stock from 
L rather than purchasing L2 stock from L1. L1 and L2 file a consolidated 
return for their first taxable year ending after May 22, Year 3, and 
each of L1 and L2 carries over a part of the net operating loss of the P 
group that arose in Year 1. Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, L1 
and L2 cease to be members of the L loss subgroup on May 22, Year 3. The 
net operating losses carried over from the P group are treated as pre-
change subgroup attributes of the loss subgroup composed of L1 and L2. 
The subgroup section 382 limitation with respect to those losses is zero 
unless M elects to apportion all or part of the subgroup section 382 
limitation of the L loss subgroup to the L1 loss subgroup. The following 
is a graphic illustration of these facts:

[[Page 624]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27JN96.020

    Example 3. Ceasing to bear a section 1504(a)(1) relationship to a 
loss subgroup parent. (a) A owns all the stock of P, and P owns all the 
stock of L1 and L2. The P group has a consolidated net operating loss 
arising in Year 1 that is carried over to Year 3 and Year 4. Corporation 
M acquires all the stock of P on November 11, Year 3, and P, L1, and L2 
thereafter file consolidated returns with M. M's acquisition results in 
an ownership change of the P loss subgroup under Sec. 1.1502-
92A(b)(1)(ii). The following is a graphic illustration of these facts:

[[Page 625]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27JN96.021

    (b) P distributes the L2 stock to M on October 7, Year 4. L2 ceases 
to be a member of the P loss subgroup on October 7, Year 4, the first 
day that it ceases to bear the relationship described in section 
1504(a)(1) to P, the P loss subgroup parent. See paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of 
this section. Thus, the section 382 limitation with respect to the pre-
change

[[Page 626]]

subgroup attributes attributable to L2 is zero except to the extent M 
elects to apportion all or a part of the subgroup section 382 limitation 
of the P loss subgroup to L2.
    Example 4. Relationship through a successor. The facts are the same 
as in Example 3, except that, instead of P's distributing the stock of 
L2, L2 merges into L1 on October 7, Year 4. L1 (as successor to L2 in 
the merger within the meaning of Sec. 1.382-2T(f)(4)) continues to bear 
a relationship described in section 1504(a)(1) to P, the loss subgroup 
parent. Thus, L2 does not cease to be a member of the P loss subgroup as 
a result of the merger.

    (e) Filing the election to apportion--(1) Form of the election to 
apportion. An election under paragraph (c) of this section must be made 
by the common parent. The election must be made in the form of the 
following statement: ``THIS IS AN ELECTION UNDER Sec. 1.1502-95A OF THE 
INCOME TAX REGULATIONS TO APPORTION ALL OR PART OF THE [insert either 
CONSOLIDATED SECTION 382 LIMITATION or SUBGROUP SECTION 382 LIMITATION, 
as appropriate] TO [insert name and E.I.N. of the corporation (or the 
corporations that compose a new loss subgroup) to which allocation is 
made]. The declaration must also include the following information, as 
appropriate--
    (i) The date of the ownership change that resulted in the 
consolidated section 382 limitation (or subgroup section 382 
limitation);
    (ii) The amount of the consolidated section 382 limitation (or 
subgroup section 382 limitation) for the taxable year during which the 
former member (or new loss subgroup) ceases to be a member of the 
consolidated group (determined without regard to any apportionment under 
this section;
    (iii) The amount of the value element and adjustment element of the 
consolidated section 382 limitation (or subgroup section 382 limitation) 
that is apportioned to the former member (or new loss subgroup) pursuant 
to paragraph (c) of this section; and
    (iv) The name and E.I.N. of the common parent making the 
apportionment.
    (2) Signing of the election. The election statement must be signed 
by both the common parent and the former member (or, in the case of a 
loss subgroup, the common parent and the loss subgroup parent) by 
persons authorized to sign their respective income tax returns.
    (3) Filing of the election. The election statement must be filed by 
the common parent of the group that is apportioning the consolidated 
section 382 limitation (or the subgroup section 382 limitation) with its 
income tax return for the taxable year in which the former member (or 
new loss subgroup) ceases to be a member. The common parent must also 
deliver a copy of the statement to the former member (or the members of 
the new loss subgroup) on or before the day the group files its income 
tax return for the consolidated return year that the former member (or 
new loss subgroup) ceases to be a member. A copy of the statement must 
be attached to the first return of the former member (or the first 
return in which the members of a new loss subgroup join) that is filed 
after the close of the consolidated return year of the group of which 
the former member (or the members of a new loss subgroup) ceases to be a 
member.
    (4) Revocation of election. An election statement made under 
paragraph (c) of this section is revocable only with the consent of the 
Commissioner.

<R05>
Sec. 1.1502-96A  Miscellaneous rules generally applicable for testing 
dates before June 25, 1999.

    (a) End of separate tracking of losses--(1) Application. This 
paragraph (a) applies to a member (or a loss subgroup) with a net 
operating loss carryover that arose (or is treated under Sec. 1.1502-
21(c) or 1.1502-21T(c) in effect prior to June 25, 1999, as contained in 
26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 1999, as applicable as arising) in a SRLY 
(or a net unrealized built-in gain or loss determined at the time that 
the member (or loss subgroup) becomes a member of the consolidated group 
if there is--
    (i) An ownership change of the member (or loss subgroup in 
connection with, or after, becoming a member of the group; or

[[Page 627]]

    (ii) A period of 5 consecutive years following the day that the 
member (or loss subgroup) becomes a member of a group during which the 
member (or loss subgroup) has not had an ownership change.
    (2) Effect of end of separate tracking. If this paragraph (a) 
applies with respect to a member (or loss subgroup), then, starting on 
the day after the earlier of the change date (but not earlier than the 
day the member (or loss subgroup) becomes a member of the consolidated 
group) or the last day of the 5 consecutive year period described in 
paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, the member's net operating loss 
carryover that arose (or is treated under Sec. 1.1502-21(c) or 1.1502-
21T(c) in effect prior to June 25, 1999, as contained in 26 CFR part 1 
revised April 1, 1999, as applicable as arising) in a SRLY, is treated 
as described in Sec. 1.1502-91A(c)(1)(i). Also, the member's separately 
computed net unrealized built-in gain or loss is included in the 
determination whether the group has a net unrealized built-in gain or 
loss. The preceding sentences also apply for purposes of determining 
whether there is an ownership change with respect to such attributes 
following such change date (or earlier day) or 5 consecutive year 
period. Thus, for example, starting the day after the change date or the 
end of the 5 consecutive year period--
    (i) The consolidated group which includes the new loss member or 
loss subgroup is no longer required to separately track owner shifts of 
the stock of the new loss member or loss subgroup parent to determine if 
an ownership change occurs with respect to the attributes of the new 
loss member or members included in the loss subgroup;
    (ii) The group includes the member's attributes in determining 
whether it is a loss group under Sec. 1.1502-91A(c);
    (iii) There is an ownership change with respect to such attributes 
only if the group is a loss group and has an ownership change; and
    (iv) If the group has an ownership change, such attributes are pre-
change consolidated attributes subject to the loss group's consolidated 
section 382 limitation.
    (3) Continuing effect of end of separate tracking. As the context 
may require, a current group determines which of its members are 
included in a loss subgroup on any testing date by taking into account 
the application of this section in the former group. See the example in 
Sec. 1.1502-91A(f)(2).
    (4) Special rule for testing period. For purposes of determining the 
beginning of the testing period for a loss group, the member's (or loss 
subgroup's) net operating loss carryovers (or net unrealized built-in 
gain or loss) described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section are 
considered to arise--
    (i) In a case described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, in a 
taxable year that begins not earlier than the later of the day following 
the change date or the day that the member becomes a member of the 
group; and
    (ii) in a case described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, in 
a taxable year that begins 3 years before the end of the 5 consecutive 
year period.
    (5) Limits on effects of end of separate tracking. The rule 
contained in this paragraph (a) applies solely for purposes of 
Sec. Sec. 1.1502-91A through 1.1502-95A and this section (other than 
paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section (relating to the definition of 
pre-change attributes of a subsidiary)) and Sec. 1.1502-98A, and not 
for purposes of other provisions of the consolidated return regulations, 
including, for example, Sec. Sec. 1.1502-15 and 1.1502-21 (or Sec. 
1.1502-15T in effect prior to June 25, 1999, as contained in 26 CFR part 
1 revised April 1, 1999, and 1.1502-21T in effect prior to June 25, 
1999, as contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 1999, as 
applicable) (relating to the consolidated net operating loss deduction). 
See also paragraph (c) of this section for the continuing effect of an 
ownership change with respect to pre-change attributes.
    (b) Ownership change of subsidiary--(1) Ownership change of a 
subsidiary because of options or plan or arrangement. Notwithstanding 
Sec. 1.1502-92A, a subsidiary may have an ownership change for purposes 
of section 382 with respect to its attributes which a group or loss 
subgroup includes in making a determination under Sec. 1.1502-91A(c)(1) 
(relating to the definition of loss group) or Sec. 1.1502-91A(d) 
(relating to the definition of loss subgroup). The subsidiary has such 
an

[[Page 628]]

ownership change if it has an ownership change under the principles of 
Sec. 1.1502-95A(b) and section 382 and the regulations thereunder 
(determined on a separate entity basis by treating the subsidiary as not 
being a member of a consolidated group) in the event of--
    (i) The deemed exercise under Sec. 1.382-4(d) of an option or 
options (other than an option with respect to stock of the common 
parent) held by a person (or persons acting pursuant to a plan or 
arrangement) to acquire more than 20 percent of the stock of the 
subsidiary; or
    (ii) An increase by 1 or more 5-percent shareholders, acting 
pursuant to a plan or arrangement to avoid an ownership change of a 
subsidiary, in their percentage ownership interest in the subsidiary by 
more than 50 percentage points during the testing period of the 
subsidiary through the acquisition (or deemed acquisition pursuant to 
Sec. 1.382-4(d)) of ownership interests in the subsidiary and in 
higher-tier members with respect to the subsidiary.
    (2) Effect of the ownership change--(i) In general. If a subsidiary 
has an ownership change under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the 
amount of consolidated taxable income for any post-change year that may 
be offset by the pre-change losses of the subsidiary shall not exceed 
the section 382 limitation for the subsidiary. For purposes of this 
limitation, the value of the subsidiary is determined solely by 
reference to the value of the subsidiary's stock.
    (ii) Pre-change losses. The pre-change losses of a subsidiary are--
    (A) Its allocable part of any consolidated net operating loss which 
is attributable to it under Sec. 1.1502-21(b) or 1.1502-21T(b) in 
effect prior to June 25, 1999, as contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised 
April 1, 1999, as applicable (determined on the last day of the 
consolidated return year that includes the change date) that is not 
carried back and absorbed in a taxable year prior to the year including 
the change date;
    (B) Its net operating loss carryovers that arose (or are treated 
under Sec. 1.1502-21(c) or 1.1502-21T(c) in effect prior to June 25, 
1999, as contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 1999, as applicable 
as having arisen) in a SRLY; and
    (C) Its recognized built-in loss with respect to its separately 
computed net unrealized built-in loss, if any, determined on the change 
date.
    (3) Coordination with Sec. Sec. 1.1502-91A, 1.1502-92A, and 1.1502-
94A. If an increase in percentage ownership interest causes an ownership 
change with respect to an attribute under this paragraph (b) and under 
Sec. 1.1502-92A on the same day, the ownership change is considered to 
occur only under Sec. 1.1502-92A and not under this paragraph (b). See 
Sec. 1.1502-94A for anti-duplication rules relating to value.
    (4) Example. The following example illustrates paragraph (b)(1)(ii) 
of this section.

    Example. Plan to avoid an ownership change of a subsidiary. (a) L 
owns all the stock of L1, L1 owns all the stock of L2, L2 owns all the 
stock of L3, and L3 owns all the stock of L4. The L group has a 
consolidated net operating loss arising in Year 1 that is carried over 
to Year 2. L has assets other than its L1 stock with a value of $900. 
L1, L2, and L3 own no assets other than their L2, L3, and L4 stock. L4 
has assets with a value of $100. During Year 2, A, B, C, and D, acting 
pursuant to a plan to avoid an ownership change of L4, acquire the 
following ownership interests in the members of the L loss group: (A) on 
September 11, Year 2, A acquires 20 percent of the L1 stock from L and B 
acquires 20 percent of the L2 stock from L1; and (B) on September 20, 
Year 2, C acquires 20 percent of the stock of L3 from L2 and D acquires 
20 percent of the stock of L4 from L3. The following is a graphic 
illustration of these facts:

[[Page 629]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27JN96.022

    (b) The acquisitions by A, B, C, and D pursuant to the plan have 
increased their respective percentage ownership interests in L4 by 
approximately 10, 13, 16, and 20 percentage points, for a total of 
approximately 59 percentage points during the testing period. This more 
than 50 percentage point increase in the percentage ownership interest 
in L4 causes an ownership change of L4 under paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section.

    (c) Continuing effect of an ownership change. A loss corporation (or 
loss subgroup) that is subject to a limitation under section 382 with 
respect to its

[[Page 630]]

pre-change losses continues to be subject to the limitation regardless 
of whether it becomes a member or ceases to be a member of a 
consolidated group. See Sec. 1.382-5(d) (relating to successive 
ownership changes and absorption of a section 382 limitation).

Sec. 1.1502-98A  Coordination with section 383 generally applicable for 
testing dates (or members joining or leaving a group) before June 25, 1999.

    The rules contained in Sec. Sec. 1.1502-91A through 1.1502-96A also 
apply for purposes of section 383, with appropriate adjustments to 
reflect that section 383 applies to credits and net capital losses. 
Similarly, in the case of net capital losses, general business credits, 
and excess foreign taxes that are pre-change attributes, Sec. 1.383-1 
applies the principles of Sec. Sec. 1.1502-91A through 1.1502-96A. For 
example, if a loss group has an ownership change under Sec. 1.1502-92A 
and has a carryover of unused general business credits from a pre-change 
consolidated return year to a post-change consolidated return year, the 
amount of the group's regular tax liability for the post-change year 
that can be offset by the carryover cannot exceed the consolidated 
section 383 credit limitation for that post-change year, determined by 
applying the principles of Sec. Sec. 1.383-1(c)(6) and 1.1502-93A 
(relating to the computation of the consolidated section 382 
limitation).

<R05>
Sec. 1.1502-99A  Effective dates.

    (a) Effective date--(1) In general. Except as provided in Sec. 
1.1502-99(b), Sec. Sec. 1.1502-91A through 1.1502-96A and 1.1502-98A 
apply to any testing date on or after January 1, 1997, and before June 
25, 1999. Sections 1.1502-94A through 1.1502-96A also apply on any date 
on or after January 1, 1997, and before June 25, 1999, on which a 
corporation becomes a member of a group or on which a corporation ceases 
to be a member of a loss group (or a loss subgroup).
    (2) Anti-duplication rules for recognized built-in gain. Section 
1.1502-93(c)(2) (relating to recognized built-in gain of a loss group or 
loss subgroup) applies to taxable years for which the due date for 
income tax returns (without extensions) is after June 25, 1999,
    (b) Testing period may include a period beginning before January 1, 
1997. A testing period for purposes of Sec. Sec. 1.1502-91A through 
1.1502-96A and 1.1502-98A may include a period beginning before January 
1, 1997. Thus, for example, in applying Sec. 1.1502-92A(b)(1)(i) 
(relating to the determination of an ownership change of a loss group), 
the determination of the lowest percentage ownership interest of any 5-
percent shareholder of the common parent during a testing period ending 
on a testing date occurring on or after January 1, 1997, takes into 
account the period beginning before January 1, 1997, except to the 
extent that the period is more than 3 years before the testing date or 
is otherwise before the beginning of the testing period. See Sec. 
1.1502-92A(b)(1).
    (c) Transition rules--(1) Methods permitted--(i) In general. For the 
period ending before January 1, 1997, a consolidated group is permitted 
to use any method described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section which is 
consistently applied to determine if an ownership change occurred with 
respect to a consolidated net operating loss, a net operating loss 
carryover (including net operating loss carryovers arising in SRLYs), or 
a net unrealized built-in loss. If an ownership change occurred during 
that period, the group is also permitted to use any method described in 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section which is consistently applied to 
compute the amount of the section 382 limitation that applies to limit 
the use of taxable income in any post-change year ending before, on, or 
after January 1, 1997. The preceding sentence does not preclude the 
imposition of an additional, lesser limitation due to a subsequent 
ownership change nor, except as

[[Page 631]]

provided in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, does it permit the 
beginning of a new testing period for the loss group.
    (ii) Adjustments to offset excess limitation. If an ownership change 
occurred during the period ending before January 1, 1997, and a method 
described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section was not used for a post-
change year, the members (or group) must reduce the section 382 
limitation for post-change years for which an income tax return is filed 
after January 1, 1997, to offset, as quickly as possible, the effects of 
any section 382 limitation that members took into account in excess of 
the amount that would have been allowable under Sec. Sec. 1.1502-91A 
through 1.1502-96A and 1.1502-98A.
    (iii) Coordination with effective date. Notwithstanding that a group 
may have used a method described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) or (iii) of 
this section for the period before January 1, 1997, Sec. Sec. 1.1502-
91A through 1.1502-96A and 1.1502-98A apply to any testing date 
occurring on or after January 1, 1997, for purposes of determining 
whether there is an ownership change with respect to any losses and, if 
so, the collateral consequences. Any ownership change of a member other 
than the common parent pursuant to a method described in paragraph 
(c)(2)(ii) or (iii) of this section does not cause a new testing period 
of the loss group to begin for purposes of applying Sec. 1.1502-92A on 
or after January 1, 1997.
    (2) Permitted methods. The methods described in this paragraph 
(c)(2) are:
    (i) A method that does not materially differ from the rules in 
Sec. Sec. 1.1502-91A through 1.1502-96A and 1.1502-98A (other than 
those in Sec. 1.1502-95A(c) and (b)(2)(ii) (relating to the 
apportionment of a section 382 limitation) as they would apply to a 
corporation that ceases to be a member of the group before January 1, 
1997). As the context requires, the method must treat references to 
rules in current regulations as references to rules in regulations 
generally effective for taxable years before January 1, 1997. Thus, for 
example, the taxpayer must treat a reference to Sec. 1.382-4(d) 
(relating to options) as a reference to Sec. 1.382-2T(h)(4) for any 
testing date to which Sec. 1.382-2T(h)(4) applies. Similarly, a 
reference to Sec. 1.1502-21(c) or 1.1502-21T(c) in effect prior to June 
25, 1999, as contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 1999, as 
applicable may be a reference to Sec. 1.1502-21A(c), as appropriate. 
Furthermore, the method must treat all corporations that were affiliated 
on January 1, 1987, and continuously thereafter as having met the 5 
consecutive year requirement of Sec. 1.1502-91A(d)(2)(i) on any day 
before January 1, 1992, on which the determination of net unrealized 
built-in gain or loss of a loss subgroup is made;
    (ii) A reasonable application of the rules in section 382 and the 
regulations thereunder applied to each member on a separate entity 
basis, treating each member's allocable part of a consolidated net 
operating loss which is attributable to it under Sec. 1.1502-21(b) or 
1.1502-21T(b) in effect prior to June 25, 1999, as contained in 26 CFR 
part 1 revised April 1, 1999, as applicable as a net operating loss of 
that member and applying rules similar to Sec. 1.382-8 to avoid 
duplication of value in computing the section 382 limitation for the 
member (see Sec. 1.382-8(h) (relating to the effective date and 
transition rules regarding controlled groups)); or
    (iii) A method approved by the Commissioner upon application by the 
common parent.
    (d) Amended returns. A group may file an amended return in 
connection with an ownership change occurring before January 1, 1997, to 
modify the amount of a section 382 limitation with respect to a 
consolidated net operating loss, a net operating loss carryover 
(including net operating loss carryovers arising in SRLYs), or a 
recognized built-in loss (or gain) only if it files amended returns:
    (1) For the earliest taxable year ending after December 31, 1986, in 
which it had an ownership change, if any, under Sec. 1.1502-92A;
    (2) For all subsequent taxable years for which returns have already 
been filed as of the date of the amended return;
    (3) The modification with respect to all members for all taxable 
years ending in 1987 and thereafter complies with Sec. Sec. 1.1502-91A 
through 1.1502-96A and 1.1502-98A; and

[[Page 632]]

    (4) The amended return(s) permitted by the applicable statute of 
limitations is/are filed before March 26, 1997.
    (e) Section 383. This section also applies for the purposes of 
section 383, with appropriate adjustments to reflect that section 383 
applies to credits and net capital losses.

DUAL CONSOLIDATED LOSSES INCURRED IN TAXABLE YEARS BEGINNING BEFORE 
OCTOBER 1, 1992--Table of Contents





<R05>
Sec. 1.1503-2A  Dual consolidated loss.

    (a) In general. This section applies for purposes of determining 
whether and to what extent the net operating loss of a dual resident 
corporation incurred in tax years beginning after December 31, 1986, 
shall be allowed to reduce the taxable income of any other member of the 
affiliated group. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, 
any dual consolidated loss of a domestic corporation incurred in taxable 
years beginning after December 31, 1986, cannot reduce the taxable 
income of any affiliate of such domestic corporation for that or any 
other taxable year, regardless of whether those losses offset income of 
another corporation under the income tax laws of the foreign country and 
regardless of whether any of the income of any corporation that the loss 
may reduce in the foreign country is, has been, or will be subject to 
tax in the United States. This rule shall also apply to preclude the use 
of a dual consolidated loss to offset any income of an affiliate 
(whether or not an election to file a consolidated return has been made) 
by means of a transaction subject to section 381 of the Code. For 
purposes of the preceding sentence, an ``affiliate'' means any member of 
the affiliated group as determined under section 1504(a) without regard 
to the exceptions contained in section 1504(b) (other than section 
1504(b)(3)) relating to includible corporations. Further, this rule 
shall also apply to preclude the use of a dual consolidated loss of a 
separate unit by a domestic corporation upon or as a result of the 
termination, liquidation, or sale of the separate unit. The following 
example illustrates the application of this paragraph (a).

    Example. P, a domestic corporation, owns all of the outstanding 
stock of DRC, a domestic corporation. DRC is managed and controlled in 
Country W, a country which determines the tax residence of corporations 
according to place of management and control. Therefore, the income of 
DRC is subject to tax in both the United States and in Country W. There 
are currently no other corporations in Country W which could use the 
losses of DRC to offset income under the income tax laws of Country W. P 
no longer wishes to operate DRC as a separate corporation. Therefore DRC 
will be liquidated into P under section 332 of the Code. Normally, P, 
under section 381, would succeed to and take into account DRC's net 
operating loss carryovers. However, this paragraph (a) prohibits the net 
operating loss of DRC from reducing P's income (including income of P 
generated by assets previously held by DRC) for U.S. tax purposes. 
Therefore, DRC's net operating loss carryovers will not be available to 
offset P's income unless one of the exceptions described in paragraph 
(c) of this section applies.

    (b) Definitions. The following definitions apply for purposes of 
this section.
    (1) Domestic corporation. For purposes of this section, the term 
``domestic corporation'' has the meaning assigned to it by sections 7701 
(a)(3) and (a)(4) and shall also include any corporation treated as a 
domestic corporation by the Internal Revenue Code, including, but not 
limited to, section 269B and section 1504(d). Subject to the rules of 
paragraph (d) of this section, any separate unit (as defined in 
paragraph (b)(4) of this section) of a domestic corporation will be 
treated as a separate domestic corporation (and as a dual resident 
corporation) for purposes of this section. The following example 
illustrates the application of this paragraph (b)(1).

    Example. A is a domestic corporation with a branch operation in 
Country X. A is owned by FP, a Country X corporation. Country X allows 
the Country X branch income and losses of A to be used to offset FP's 
losses or income. Under paragraph (d) of this section, the branch 
operations of A in Country X will be treated as a separate domestic 
corporation and as a dual resident corporation for purposes of this 
section. See paragraph (d) of this section for the treatment of any dual

[[Page 633]]

consolidated loss of the branch operations of A.

    (2) Dual consolidated loss. The term ``dual consolidated loss'' 
means the net operating loss (as defined in section 172(c) and the 
regulations thereunder) of a domestic corporation incurred in a year in 
which the corporation is a dual resident corporation. The fact that a 
particular item taken into account in computing such net operating loss 
deduction is not taken into account in computing income subject to 
income tax in a foreign country shall not cause such item to be excluded 
from the calculation of the dual consolidated loss. A dual consolidated 
loss shall arise even though no other person, corporation, or entity is 
permitted, under the income tax laws of the foreign country, to use by 
any means the losses, expenses or deductions of the dual resident 
corporation to offset income. A dual consolidated loss shall not 
include--
    (i) The net operating loss incurred during that portion of the 
taxable year prior to the date on which the domestic corporation becomes 
a dual resident corporation or subsequent to the date on which the 
domestic corporation ceases to be a dual resident corporation. For 
purposes of determining the amount of the net operating loss incurred in 
that portion of the taxable year prior to the date on which the domestic 
corporation becomes a dual resident corporation or subsequent to the 
date on which the domestic corporation ceases to be a dual resident 
corporation, in no event shall more than a pro rata portion of the net 
operating loss commensurate with the portion of the taxable year during 
which the domestic corporation was not a dual resident corporation be 
allocated to that portion of the taxable year in which the domestic 
corporation was not a dual resident corporation; or
    (ii) Losses incurred in taxable years beginning on or before 
December 31, 1986.
    (3) Dual resident corporation. For purposes of this section, a 
domestic corporation shall be a dual resident corporation if the 
worldwide income of such corporation is subject to the income tax of a 
foreign country, or such corporation is subject to the income tax of a 
foreign country on a residence basis (and not on a source basis).
    (4) Separate unit. Solely for purposes of this section, the term 
``separate unit'' shall mean any of the following:
    (i) A foreign branch as defined in Sec. 1.367 (a)-6T(g);
    (ii) A partnership interest; or
    (iii) A trust interest.
    (5) Subject to tax. For purposes of determining whether a domestic 
corporation is subject to the income tax of a foreign country on its 
income, the fact that the corporation has no actual tax liability to the 
foreign country for a particular taxable year shall not be taken into 
consideration.
    (c) Exceptions--(1) No ability to use dual consolidated loss under 
foreign law--(i) In general. Paragraph (a) of this section shall not 
apply to a dual consolidated loss if--
    (A) At no time after December 31, 1986, has there been any other 
person, corporation, or entity which, under the income tax laws of the 
foreign country, is permitted to use by any means the losses, expenses, 
or deductions of the dual resident corporation to offset income; and
    (B) Under the income tax laws of the foreign country, the losses, 
expenses, or deductions of the dual resident corporation incurred in 
taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, cannot be carried over 
or back to be used, by any means, to offset the income of any other 
person, corporation, or entity in other years.
    (ii) Limitations. For purposes of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this 
section, none of the following circumstances shall constitute a 
satisfaction of paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A) of this section--
    (A) The failure to make use of an election (including, but not 
limited to, the ability to surrender losses, expenses or deductions) 
that would enable another person, corporation, or entity to use the 
losses, expenses, or deductions of the dual resident corporation to 
offset income under the income tax laws of the foreign country;
    (B) The fact that the income tax laws of the foreign country deny 
the use of losses, expenses, or deductions of its

[[Page 634]]

corporate residents that are also residents for tax purposes of another 
country to offset income of another person, corporation, or entity;
    (C) The fact that the other person, corporation, or entity does not 
have sufficient income to benefit from an offset permitted under the 
income tax laws of the foreign country for a particular taxable year; or
    (D) The fact that the dual resident corporation has no losses, 
expenses, or deductions during a particular taxable year.
    (iii) Examples. The following examples illustrate this paragraph 
(c)(1).

    Example (1). DRC, a domestic corporation, is also subject to tax in 
Country Y on its worldwide income. DRC has been filing a consolidated 
return for U.S. income tax purposes with DP, its domestic parent. DRC 
has also been able to use its losses to offset income of its affiliates 
in Country Y by using Country Y's form of consolidation. In order to 
prevent companies like DRC from taking losses against income of 
affiliates under Country Y law and then again using the losses of DRC to 
offset income of affiliates for U.S. tax purposes. Country Y law 
prevents a company which is also subject to tax on its worldwide income 
in another country, or is subject to tax on a residence basis in another 
country, from using the Country Y form of consolidation. DRC is a dual 
resident corporation as defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. 
DRC's losses are dual consolidated losses as defined in paragraph (b)(2) 
of this section which under paragraph (a) of this section may not be 
used to offset income of any other U.S. affiliate of DRC. The Country Y 
statute does not cause the exception provided by this paragraph (c)(1) 
to apply.
    Example (2). P, a domestic corporation, owns DRC, a domestic 
corporation which is also subject to the income tax laws of Country Z on 
a residence basis, and FS, a Country Z corporation. Under Country Z 
laws, income or losses of DRC may not be consolidated with income or 
losses of P or FS. There is, however, a provision under Country Z's law 
by which DRC's unused losses could be carried forward, acquired, and 
used by FS if DRC is merged into FS. DRC's dual consolidated loss does 
not qualify for the exception from application of paragraph (a) provided 
by this paragraph (c)(1) because of the loss carryforward provisions 
under Country Z's income tax laws. However, DRC may qualify for an 
exemption from paragraph (a) of this section under the provisions of 
paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
    Example (3). DRC is a dual resident corporation subject to tax on a 
residence basis in foreign country Y. Under the income tax laws of Y, 
DRC could elect to use its losses to offset the income of foreign entity 
FE on a Country Y consolidated income tax return for the taxable year 
ending December 31, 1987. Regardless of whether such election is made, 
DRC fails to satisfy the requirement of paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A) of this 
section.
    Example (4). The same facts apply as in Example (3), except that 
Country Y changes its income tax law, effective as of January 1, 1987, 
to prevent the consolidation of losses by dual resident corporations. 
Under paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, the fact that this 
Country Y legislation prevents DRC from using its losses to offset the 
income of FE is disregarded and DRC fails to satisfy the requirement of 
paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A) of this section.
    Example (5). The same facts apply as in Example (4), except that FE 
has no taxable income in taxable years 1987 through 1989. Moreover, DRC 
is profitable throughout this period and consequently has no losses 
which it could share with FE. Under paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) (C) and (D) of 
this section, the fact that FE would not receive a tax benefit from 
consolidation with DRC on a Country Y return is disregarded and DRC 
fails to satisfy the requirement of paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A) of this 
section. Because DRC does not have a net operating loss during 1987 
through 1989, section 1503(d) does not affect the consolidation of DRC 
on a U.S. return for these years. However, DRC's failure to satisfy 
paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A) of this section at all times after December 31, 
1986 will make it ineligible for the exception described in paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section with respect to any future taxable year in which 
it incurs a net operating loss.
    Example (6). The same facts apply as in Example (5). In 1990, FE is 
transferred and is no longer eligible for consolidation on a Country Y 
return. There are no other entities with which DRC could consolidate 
under the income tax laws of Y. Nevertheless, since FE and DRC could 
have consolidated on a Country Y return during the period after December 
31, 1986 and before the transfer of FE, DRC fails to satisfy the 
requirement of paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A) of this section in 1990 and in all 
future taxable years.

    (2) Elective agreement in place between United States and the 
foreign country. Paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply to a dual 
consolidated loss to the extent such loss is subject to an election by 
the dual resident corporation to deduct the loss in the United States 
pursuant to an agreement entered into between the United States and the 
foreign country which puts into place an elective procedure through 
which losses would offset income in only one country.

[[Page 635]]

    (3) Agreement to amend returns upon later use of losses, expenses, 
or deductions of a dual resident corporation--(i) In general. 
Notwithstanding that, under the income tax laws of the foreign country, 
the losses, expenses, or deductions of the dual resident corporation can 
be carried over or back to offset, by some means, the income of any 
other person, corporation, or entity in other taxable years, paragraph 
(a) of this section shall not apply to a dual consolidated loss of that 
dual resident corporation if the requirements described in this 
paragraph (c)(3)(i) are satisfied.
    (A) At no time after December 31, 1986, has there been any other 
person, corporation, or entity which, under the income tax laws of the 
foreign country, is permitted to use by any means the losses, expenses, 
or deductions of the dual resident corporation to offset income. For 
purposes of the preceding sentence, none of the circumstances described 
in paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) (A) through (D) of this section shall 
constitute a satisfaction of this paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A).
    (B) The affiliated group or, if there is no affiliated group filing 
a consolidated return, the dual resident corporation which incurs the 
loss, files with its U.S. tax return for the taxable year in which the 
dual consolidated loss arises a binding agreement described in 
paragraphs (c)(3) (ii) and (iii) of this section. The agreement must be 
filed under this paragraph (c)(3) even if the only effect of the dual 
consolidated loss is to increase a net operating loss for U.S. tax 
purposes.
    (ii) Description of agreement. Except as otherwise provided in 
paragraph (c)(3)(viii) of this section, the agreement described in this 
paragraph (c)(3)(ii) must be attached to, and filed by the due date 
(including extensions) of, the tax return of the affiliated group or 
dual resident corporation for the taxable year in which the dual 
consolidated loss arises. The agreement must be signed under penalties 
of perjury by the person who signs the tax return of the group or dual 
resident corporation. The agreement must include the following items, in 
paragraphs labeled to correspond with the subdivisions set forth below:
    (A) The name, address, identifying number, and place and date of 
incorporation of the dual resident corporation and the country or 
countries which tax the dual resident corporation on a residence basis 
or which tax the worldwide income of the dual resident corporation;
    (B) A statement that the document submitted constitutes the 
agreement of the affiliated group or dual resident corporation in 
accordance with the requirements of Sec. 1.1503-2T(c)(3);
    (C) A statement of the amount of the dual consolidated loss to be 
covered by the agreement and the year in which it arose;
    (D) The agreement of the group or dual resident corporation to amend 
returns, as described in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section;
    (E) A waiver of the period of limitations, as described in paragraph 
(c)(3)(iv) of this section; and
    (F) An agreement to file with the tax returns of the group or dual 
resident corporation for each of the fifteen years following the year 
the dual consolidated loss arose a waiver of the period of limitation, 
as described in paragrapah (c)(3)(iv) of this section, and a 
certification as described in paragraph (c)(3)(v) of this section.
    (iii) Terms of agreement. The affiliated group or dual resident 
corporation must agree that if there is a ``triggering event'' described 
in this paragraph (c)(3)(iii), then, the affiliated group filing a 
consolidated return, or if there is no affiliated group filing a 
consolidated return, the dual resident corporation, shall, within 90 
days after the date of occurrence of the triggering event, file an 
amended U.S. income tax return for the taxable year in which the dual 
consolidated loss arose reporting the dual consolidated loss on the 
amended return as a loss to which paragraph (a) of this section applies. 
An amended U.S. income tax return must also be filed for any other 
taxable year in which the tax liability increases as a result of such 
applications of paragraph (a) of this section. In addition, upon 
examination, the group or dual resident corporation must provide to the 
District Director a schedule of the amended carryforward and carryback 
losses and credits for each of

[[Page 636]]

the group's or dual resident corporation's taxable years for which no 
amended return is required to be filed pursuant to this paragraph 
(c)(3)(iii). For purposes of section 6601, the last date prescribed for 
payment of the additional amount of tax shown on an amended return filed 
pursuant to this paragraph (c)(3)(iii) shall be the same date as the 
date prescribed for the payment of tax for the taxable year with respect 
to which the amended return is filed. Any of the following events shall 
constitute a ``triggering event'' for purposes of this section--
    (A) There is a failure for any taxable year to file the annual 
waiver or certification described in paragraphs (c)(3)(iv) and (v) of 
this section.
    (B) Prior to the close of the fifteenth taxable year following the 
taxable year in which the dual consolidated loss arose, any of the 
following events--
    (1) There is a failure to satisfy both the requirement of paragraph 
(c)(3)(i)(A) of this section and the requirements of paragraph (c)(4) of 
this section;
    (2) Where the agreement is made by an affiliated group filing a 
consolidated return, the dual resident corporation (or its successor-in-
interest) ceases to be a member of the affiliated group;
    (3) Where the agreement is made by a dual resident corporation that 
is not a member of an affiliated group filing a consolidated return, the 
dual resident corporation is no longer in existence; or
    (4) Where the dual resident corporation is a separate unit of a 
domestic corporation, the domestic corporation sells or transfers the 
dual resident corporation.
    (iv) Waiver of period of limitation. The affiliated group or the 
dual resident corporation (or the successor-in-interest of such group or 
dual resident corporation) must file, with the agreement to amend 
returns and with the tax return for each of the fifteen taxable years 
following the taxable year in which the dual consolidated loss arose, a 
waiver of the limitation on assessment of any tax resulting from the 
amendment of any return as described in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this 
section. The waiver shall extend the period for assessment of such tax 
to a date not earlier than three years after the return is filed for the 
fifteenth taxable year following the taxable year in which the dual 
consolidated loss arose. The waiver shall also contain such other terms 
with respect to assessment as may be considered by the Commissioner to 
be necessary to insure the assessment and collection of the correct tax 
liability for each year for which the waiver is required. The waiver 
must be signed by a person authorized to sign the agreement described in 
paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section. A failure, at any time, to comply 
with the requirements of this paragraph (c)(3) or with the terms of any 
agreement filed pursuant to this paragraph (c)(3) shall extend the 
period of assessment of such tax until three years after the date on 
which the Internal Revenue Service receives actual notice of the use of 
or of the ability to use the losses, expenses, or deductions of the dual 
resident corporation to offset the income of another person, 
corporation, or entity under the income tax laws of the foreign country.
    (v) Annual certification. The affiliated group or the dual resident 
corporation (or the successor-in-interest of such group or dual resident 
corporation) must file with its income tax return for each of the 
fifteen taxable years following the taxable year in which the dual 
consolidated loss arose a certification that the losses, expenses, or 
deductions of the dual resident corporation were not used or permitted 
to be used to offset the income of another person, corporation, or 
entity under the income tax laws of a foreign country. The annual 
certification pursuant to this paragraph (c)(3)(v) must be signed under 
penalties of perjury by a person authorized to sign the agreement 
described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section. The certification 
must identify the dual consolidated loss with respect to which it is 
given by setting forth the taxpayer's year in which the loss arose and 
the amount of such loss and must warrant that arrangements have been 
made to insure that the group or dual resident corporation will be 
informed of any subsequent use of or ability to use the losses, 
expenses, or

[[Page 637]]

deductions of the dual resident corporation to offset the income of 
another person, corporation, or entity under the income tax laws of the 
foreign country. If dual consolidated losses of more than one taxable 
year are subject to the rules of this paragraph (c)(3), the 
certifications for those years may be combined in a single document, but 
each dual consolidated loss must be separately identified.
    (vi) Special rules for a succeeding group or a successor-in-
interest--(A) Ceasing to be a member of the affiliated group. For 
purposes of this paragraph (c)(3), and except as otherwise provided in 
this paragraph (c)(3)(vi), a dual resident corporation shall be deemed 
to have ceased to be a member of the affiliated group that filed the 
agreement described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section if it is no 
longer a member of that group, as defined in Sec. 1.1502-1(b), or if 
the group ceases to exist because the common parent is no longer in 
existence or is no longer a common parent or the group no longer files 
on the basis of a consolidated return. However, the obligation to file 
an amended return pursuant to the agreement described in paragraph 
(c)(3)(ii) of this section shall not apply and the dual resident 
corporation shall not be deemed to have ceased to be a member of the 
group for purposes of this paragraph (c)(3) where the dual resident 
corporation ceases to be a member of the group solely by reason of an 
acquisition of its assets by a member of the group in a transaction to 
which section 381(a) applies provided the successor-in-interest of the 
dual resident corporation continues to be a member of the group.
    (B) Special rules for a succeeding group. The obligation to file an 
amended return pursuant to the agreement described in paragraph 
(c)(3)(ii) of this section shall not apply where the dual resident 
corporation becomes a member of a succeeding group as a result of an 
acquisition described in Sec. 1.1502-13(f)(2)(i) (a) or (b) (relating 
generally to the acquisition of assets of, by, or from a member of the 
affiliated group in a tax-free reorganization) and the succeeding group 
attaches to, and files with, its timely filed (including extensions) tax 
return for the taxable year in which the acquisition takes place a 
binding agreement--
    (1) Which sets forth the same terms as are described in paragraph 
(c)(3)(ii) of this section,
    (2) In which the group agrees to be bound by the terms of the 
agreement previously filed by the terminating group, and
    (3) In which the group agrees to all the terms set forth in 
paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section.

The agreement must be signed under penalties of perjury by the person 
who signs the tax return of the succeeding group.
    (C) Special rules for a successor-in-interest. In the case of a dual 
resident corporation that was not a member of an affiliated group filing 
a consolidated return in the taxable year in which the dual consolidated 
loss arose and that filed an agreement described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) 
of this section, the assets of which are acquired in a transaction 
described in section 381(a), such corporation shall not be required to 
file an amended return pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B)(3) of this 
section provided its successor-in-interest attaches a binding agreement 
to its timely filed (including extensions) tax return for the taxable 
year in which the acquisition takes place. The agreement must be signed 
under penalties of perjury by the person who signs the tax return of the 
successor-in-interest. The agreement must:
    (1) Set forth the same terms as are described in paragraph 
(c)(3)(ii) of this section,
    (2) State the agreement of the successor-in-interest to be bound by 
the terms of the agreement previously filed by the dual resident 
corporation, and
    (3) State the agreement of the successor-in-interest to all the 
terms set forth in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section.
    (vii) Definitions. For purposes of this section--
    (A) The terms succeeding group and terminating group shall have the 
same meaning as in Sec. 1.1502.13(f)(2)(i); and
    (B) The term successor-in-interest shall mean an acquiring 
corporation that succeeds to the tax attributes of

[[Page 638]]

an acquired corporation under the provisions of section 381 by reason of 
a transaction described in section 381(a).
    (viii) Transition rules. An affiliated group or a dual resident 
corporation (or a succeeding group or a successor-in-interest of a dual 
resident corporation) that meets the eligibility requirements described 
in paragraph (c)(3)(ix) of this section will be permitted to apply the 
transition rules in this paragraph (c)(3)(viii) for taxable years ending 
before December 31, 1989.
    (A) The agreement in satisfaction of paragraph (c)(3) (ii) or (vi) 
of this section may be attached to the timely filed (including 
extensions) tax return of the affiliated group or of the dual resident 
corporation (or the succeeding group or the successor-in-interest of 
such dual resident corporation) for the first taxable year which ends on 
or after December 31, 1989. The agreement required for each of the 
taxable years ending before December 31, 1989 and for the first taxable 
year ending on or after December 31, 1989 may be combined on a single 
document.
    (B) The requirement of paragraphs (c)(3)(iv) and (c)(3)(v) of this 
section regarding the filing of an annual waiver of the period of 
limitation and certification shall be satisfied for the taxable years 
ending before December 31, 1989, and no failure to file shall be deemed 
to have occurred with respect to such taxable years for purposes of 
paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(A) of this section if the waivers and 
certifications required under paragraphs (c)(3)(iv) and (c)(3)(v) of 
this section are filed with the tax return for the first taxable year 
ending on or after December 31, 1989.
    (ix) Eligibility for transition rules. The rules in paragraph 
(c)(3)(viii) of this section shall apply only if, as of the date of the 
agreement in satisfaction of paragraph (c)(3) (ii) or (vi) of this 
section and filed pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(viii) of this section, 
none of the triggering events described in paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B) of 
this section has occurred.
    (4) No ability to use dual consolidated loss under foreign law after 
restructuring--(i) In general. Notwithstanding that a dual resident 
corporation fails to satisfy either paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A) or 
(c)(3)(i)(A) of this section, paragraph (a) of this section shall not 
apply to any dual consolidated loss (or portion of a dual consolidated 
loss) described in paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section provided the 
requirements of either paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B) or (c)(3)(i)(B) of this 
section are satisfied and a restructuring that meets the requirements of 
paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section has been completed.
    (ii) Qualified restructuring. A restructuring meets the requirements 
of this paragraph (c)(4)(ii) if it is completed on or before December 
31, 1989, in the foreign country so that at all times from the date of 
such restructuring to the close of the taxable year in which the dual 
consolidated loss arises, there is no other person, corporation, or 
entity which, under the income tax laws of the foreign country, is 
permitted to use by any means the losses, expenses, or deductions of the 
dual resident corporation to offset income. For purposes of the 
preceding sentence, none of the circumstances described in paragraphs 
(c)(1)(ii) (A) through (D) of this section shall constitute a 
satisfaction of this paragraph (c)(4)(ii).
    (iii) Qualified losses. Losses to which paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this 
section applies are the dual consolidated losses of a dual resident 
corporation that arise in a taxable year beginning after the 
restructuring described in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section (or the 
portion of any dual consolidated loss that arises during that portion of 
the taxable year following the restructuring described in paragraph 
(c)(4)(ii) of this section). For purposes of determining the amount of 
the dual consolidated loss which arises in that portion of the taxable 
year following the restructuring, in no event shall more than a pro rata 
portion of the dual consolidated loss commensurate with the portion of 
the taxable year beginning with the date of completion of the 
restructuring and ending on the last day of that same taxable year be 
allocated to that portion of the taxable year following the 
restructuring.
    (d) Special rule for separate units--(1) Separate units 
characterized as corporations under foreign law. If a separate unit of a 
domestic corporation consists of an interest in an entity (including a

[[Page 639]]

foreign branch) that for U.S. tax purposes is not taxable as an 
association, but the entity is subject to income tax in a foreign 
jurisdiction as a corporation either on its worldwide income or on a 
residence basis (and not on a source basis), then for purposes of this 
section such separate unit of the domestic corporation will be treated 
as if it were a dual resident corporation and a wholly-owned domestic 
subsidiary of the domestic corporation. For purposes of paragraphs (c) 
(3) and (4) of this section, any agreement, waiver and certification 
required to be filed with respect to such dual resident corporation 
shall be filed with the federal income tax return of the domestic 
corporation owning the separate unit or by the affiliated group with 
which the domestic corporation files a consolidated return.
    (2) Other separate units. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of 
this section, if a separate unit of a domestic corporation (other than a 
separate unit described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section) is 
permitted under the income tax laws of a foreign country--
    (i) To use its losses, expenses, or deductions to offset the income 
of any other person, corporation, or entity in the taxable year in which 
the dual consolidated loss arises; or
    (ii) To carry over or back its losses, expenses, or deductions so 
that they may offset the income of any other person, corporation, or 
entity in other years, then such separate unit will be treated for 
purposes of this section as if it were a dual resident corporation and a 
wholly-owned domestic subsidiary of the domestic corporation. For 
purposes of the preceding sentence, none of the circumstances described 
in paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) (A) through (D) of this section shall preclude 
a separate unit from being treated as a dual resident corporation and a 
separate domestic corporation under this paragraph (d)(2). This 
paragraph (d)(2) applies regardless of whether the domestic corporation 
is a member of an affiliated group, and, if it is, regardless of whether 
the group files a consolidated return.
    (3) Certification. Paragraph (d)(2) of this section shall not apply 
with respect to any taxable year for which the domestic corporation 
owning the separate unit (or the affiliated group of which the domestic 
corporation is a member) files a certification as described in this 
paragraph (d)(3). The certification must be attached to, and filed by 
the due date (including extensions) of, the federal income tax return of 
the domestic corporation owning the separate unit (or the affiliated 
group with which the domestic corporation files a consolidated return) 
for the taxable year to which it applies. With respect to returns filed 
without an attached certification for taxable years ending before 
December 31, 1989, the certification in satisfaction of this paragraph 
(d)(3) may be attached to the return for the first taxable year ending 
on or after December 31, 1989. The certification must be signed under 
penalties of perjury by the person who signs the return. The 
certification must include the following items, in paragraphs labeled to 
correspond with the subdivisions set forth below:
    (i) A statement that the document submitted constitutes the 
certification required under the provisions of Sec. 1.1503-2T(d)(3);
    (ii) Identification of the separate unit, including the name under 
which it conducts business and its principal activity;
    (iii) Identification of the total losses, expenses, and deductions 
incurred by the separate unit and included on the tax return for the 
taxable year;
    (iv) Certification that no portion of the separate unit's losses, 
expenses or deductions identified above has been or will be used to 
offset the income of any other person, corporation, or entity under the 
income tax laws of the foreign country; and
    (v) An agreement to comply with the recapture and interest charge 
requirements of paragraph (d)(4) of this section.

If the domestic corporation has more than one separate unit, the 
certification described above may be made on a single document, but the 
total losses, expenses, and deductions must be separately identified for 
each separate unit to which the certification applies.
    (4) Recapture upon subsequent use. If in any taxable year any 
portion of the losses, expenses, or deductions of a separate unit which 
were the subject of a

[[Page 640]]

certification filed under paragraph (d)(3) of this section are used by 
any means to offset the income of any other person, corporation, or 
entity under the income tax laws of a foreign country, then the total 
amount of the dual consolidated loss shall be recaptured and reported as 
income on the tax return of the domestic corporation (or the affiliated 
group with which the domestic corporation files a consolidated return) 
for the taxable year that includes the last day of the taxable year for 
foreign tax purposes during which such use occurred. In addition, the 
domestic corporation owning the separate unit (or the affiliated group 
with which the domestic files a consolidated return) shall pay an 
interest charge on the amount of additional tax owed as a result of the 
recapture described in the preceding sentence. Such interest shall be 
determined under the rules of section 6601(a) as if the additional 
amount of tax had accrued and been due and owing for the taxable year in 
which the losses, expenses, or deductions giving rise to the recapture 
gave rise to a tax benefit for U.S. income tax purposes. For purposes of 
this paragraph (d)(4), a tax benefit will be considered to have arisen 
in a taxable year in which a loss that would have been considered a dual 
consolidated loss if paragraph (d)(3) of this section had not applied 
has reduced the U.S. income tax liability of the domestic corporation or 
of the affiliated group with which it files a consolidated return.
    (5) Treatment of separate units as separate entities--(i) In 
general. A separate unit of a domestic corporation will be treated as a 
separate entity for purposes of determining under this section whether 
losses of one entity are permitted under the income tax laws of the 
foreign country to offset the income of another entity.
    (ii) Exception for separate units in same country. If two or more 
separate units (not described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section) 
located in the same foreign country are owned by a single domestic 
corporation and the income and losses of such units are consolidated on 
an income tax return in that foreign country, then the separate units 
will be treated as one separate unit for purposes of paragraph (d)(2) of 
this section.
    (6) Examples. The following examples illustrate this paragraph (d).

    Example (1). X, a member of a U.S. affiliated group, has a foreign 
branch (as defined in Sec. 1.367(a)-6T(g)) in Country Y. Under the 
Country Y income tax laws, the branch will be taxed as a permanent 
establishment and its income and losses may be used (on an elective 
basis) in the Country Y form of consolidation to offset the income of Z, 
an affiliate of X, under Country Y law. The branch of X incurs a net 
operating loss during the taxable year ending December 31, 1987. The 
foreign branch of X will be treated as a separate domestic corporation 
and a dual resident corporation under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, 
and its net operating loss will constitute a dual consolidated loss. 
Consequently, under paragraph (a) of this section, the branch's net 
operating loss may not be used to offset the income of any other U.S. 
affiliate or any income of X other than income derived from the branch 
operations. However, the branch will not be treated as a dual resident 
corporation if X (or the affiliated group of which X is a member) files 
a certification for the taxable year as described in paragraph (d)(3) of 
this section that its net operating loss was not in fact used by Z (or 
any other entity) to offset income under the Country Y income tax laws, 
and that such loss will be recaptured if it is so used in the future.
    Example (2). X is classified as a partnership for U.S. tax purposes 
under Code section 7701 and applicable regulations. A, B and C are the 
sole partners of X. A and B are domestic corporations and C is a 
resident of foreign country Y. Under Country Y's law, X is classified as 
a corporation and its income and losses may be used in the Country Y 
form of consolidation to offset the income of the companies that are 
affiliates of X. X generates net operating losses. The partnership 
interests held by A and B are each treated as separate domestic 
corporations and dual resident corporations under paragraph (d)(1) of 
this section. A's and B's pro rata share of the losses of X are dual 
consolidated losses as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. 
Under paragraph (a) of this section, the losses of X may not be used to 
offset the income of any other U.S. affiliate. A's pro rata share of 
losses of X may be used by A only to offset A's pro rata share of income 
of X. However, paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply to A's pro 
rata share of losses of X if A meets one of the exceptions described in 
paragraph (c) of this section. The same principles apply to limit the 
use of losses allocated to B.
    Example (3). Domestic corporation W owns two unincorporated business 
operations in

[[Page 641]]

Country Y. The two businesses, A and B, constitute separate foreign 
branches (as defined in Sec. 1.367(a)-6T(g)). Under the tax laws of 
Country Y, A is treated as a separate corporation and taxed on a 
residence basis. Thus, A is a separate unit described in paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section. B is not a separate unit described in paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section. W is a calendar year taxpayer for both United 
States and Country Y purposes. During the calendar year ending December 
31, 1987, A operated at a loss and B was profitable. Country Y allows 
both of W's branches to report their combined operations on a single 
income tax return. Thus, the losses incurred by A may be used on the 
1987 Country Y return to offset the income of B. A will be treated as a 
dual resident corporation under paragraph (d)(1) of this section. 
Because A is a separate unit described in paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section, paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section treats A and B as separate 
entities for purposes of determining whether the losses, expenses, or 
deductions of A may be used to offset the income of another person, 
corporation, or entity and the exception in paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this 
section does not apply. Since the loss incurred by A may be used to 
offset B's income under foreign tax laws, W will not qualify for the 
exceptions described in paragraph (c) of this section. Accordingly, W 
will report the income from B on its 1987 U.S. tax return, but will not 
be allowed to use the losses from A to offset that income or the income 
from any source other than from the operations of A.

    (e) Special rule for use of dual consolidated loss to offset tainted 
income--(1) In general. The dual consolidated loss of any dual resident 
corporation that ceases to be a dual resident corporation shall not be 
used to offset income of such corporation to the extent that such income 
is tainted income as defined in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
    (2) Tainted income defined. Tainted income is any income derived 
from tainted assets (as defined in paragraph (e)(3) of this section), 
during the period beginning on the date of the transfer or acquisition 
of tainted assets and ending at the close of the fifteenth taxable year 
following the taxable year in which the dual resident corporation ceased 
to be a dual resident corporation.
    (3) Tainted assets defined. Tainted assets are any assets 
transferred to or acquired by a dual resident corporation in a non-
recognition transaction (as defined in section 7701(a)(45)) at any time 
during the three taxable years immediately preceding the taxable year in 
which such dual resident corporation ceased to be a dual resident 
corporation or at any time during the 15 taxable years immediately 
following the taxable year in which a dual resident corporation ceased 
to be a dual resident corporation. Tainted assets shall not include 
assets that were transferred to or acquired by such dual resident 
corporation on or before December 31, 1986.
    (4) Exception. For assets transferred to or acquired by a dual 
resident corporation prior to the time it ceased to be a dual resident 
corporation, if it can be shown that, for the year in which assets were 
transferred to or acquired by such corporation, the corporation did not 
incur a dual consolidated loss (or carry forward a dual consolidated 
loss to such year) and that there was a valid business reason for the 
transfer or acquisition of such assets, the income derived from such 
assets shall not be subject to the limitation described in paragraph 
(e)(1) of this section.
    (f) Special rules for accounting for dual consolidated losses--(1) 
Determination of amount of dual consolidated loss--(i) Dual resident 
corporation that is a member of an affiliated group. For purposes of 
determining whether a dual resident corporation that is a member of an 
affiliated group filing a consolidated return has a dual consolidated 
loss for the taxable year, the dual resident corporation shall compute 
its taxable income (or loss) in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 
1.1502-12 (relating to computation of separate taxable income of a 
member of an affiliated group filing a consolidated return), determined 
by taking into account the adjustments provided in Sec. 1.1502-
79A(a)(3), that is:
    (A) The portion of the consolidated dividends received deduction, 
the consolidated charitable contributions deductions, and the 
consolidated section 247 deduction, attributable to such member;
    (B) Such member's capital gain net income (determined without regard 
to any net capital loss carryover attributable to such member);
    (C) Such member's net capital loss and section 1231 net loss, 
reduced by

[[Page 642]]

the portion of the consolidated net capital loss attributable to such 
member (as determined under paragraph (b)(2) of Sec. 1.1502-22; and
    (D) The portion of any consolidated net capital loss carryover 
attributable to such member which is absorbed in the taxable year.

For purposes of this paragraph (f), any income, gain, or loss of a dual 
resident corporation shall not be deferred or eliminated under Sec. 
1.1502-13 (b)(2) or (c), or Sec. 1.1502-14. Further, sections 267 and 
163(e)(3) shall not apply.
    (ii) Dual resident corporation that is a separate unit of a domestic 
corporation. For purposes of determining whether a dual resident 
corporation that is a separate unit of a domestic corporation has a dual 
consolidated loss for the taxable year, the dual resident corporation 
shall compute its taxable income (or loss) as if it were a separate 
domestic corporation and a dual resident corporation, using only those 
items of income, expenses, and deductions which are otherwise 
attributable to such separate unit.
    (2) Effect of dual consolidated loss. For any taxable year in which 
a dual resident corporation has a dual consolidated loss to which 
paragraph (a) of this section applies, the following rules shall apply.
    (i) If the dual resident corporation is a member of an affiliated 
group filing a consolidated return, then such affiliated group shall 
compute its taxable income without regard to the items of income, loss, 
or deduction of the dual resident corporation for the taxable year. The 
amount of taxable loss of the dual resident corporation for the taxable 
year shall be the amount of dual consolidated loss determined under 
paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section. Such loss may be carried over or 
back for use in other taxable years as a net operating loss deduction by 
the dual resident corporation to the extent permitted under section 172. 
However, such loss shall be treated as a loss incurred by the dual 
resident corporation in a separate return limitation year, and, 
including in the case of a dual resident corporation that is a common 
parent, shall be subject to all of the limitations of Sec. Sec. 
1.1502-21A(c)(2) or 1.1502-21(c) (as appropriate) (relating to 
limitations on net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks from 
separate return limitation years).
    (ii) If the dual resident corporation is a separate unit of a 
domestic corporation, then such domestic corporation and the affiliated 
group with which it may file a consolidated return shall compute taxable 
income for the taxable year without regard to the items of income, loss, 
or deductions of the dual resident corporation for the current year. 
Further, the loss of the dual resident corporation (the separate unit of 
the domestic corporation) shall be treated as a loss incurred by a 
separate corporation and its use shall be subject to all of the 
limitations of Sec. Sec. 1.1502-21A(c)(2) or 1.1502-21(c) (as 
appropriate) (relating to limitations on net operating loss carryovers 
and carrybacks from separate return limitation years), as if such dual 
resident corporation were filing a consolidated return with the domestic 
corporation or with the affiliated group with which the domestic 
corporation files a consolidated return.
    (3) Basis adjustments for dual consolidated losses. When a dual 
resident corporation is a member of an affiliated group filing a 
consolidated return, each member owning stock in the dual resident 
corporation shall adjust the basis of the stock in the manner described 
in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph (f)(3).
    (i) Positive adjustment. Adjustments shall be made in accordance 
with the principles of Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(1), except that there shall be 
no positive adjustment under Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(1)(ii) for any amount of 
the dual consolidated loss which is not absorbed. There shall be no 
positive adjustment for any amount included in income upon the use of a 
dual consolidated loss in a foreign country under Sec. 1.1503-2T(c)(3).
    (ii) Negative adjustments. Adjustments shall be made in accordance 
with the principles of Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(2), except that there shall be 
no negative adjustments under Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(2)(ii) for the amount 
of the dual consolidated loss.
    (4) Examples. The following examples illustrate this paragraph (f).

    Example (1). (i) P, S1, S2, and T are domestic corporations. P owns 
all of the stock of S1 and S2. S2 owns all of the stock of T. T is

[[Page 643]]

a dual resident corporation. None of the exceptions described in 
paragraph (c) apply with respect to T. P, S1, S2, and T have filed and 
continue to file a consolidated federal income tax return. X, Y, and 
Bank are corporations which are not members of the affiliated group of 
which P is the common parent.
    (ii) At the beginning of 1989, P had a basis in S2 of $1000. S2 had 
a basis in T of $500.
    (iii) In 1989, T had an interest expense of $100 on a loan from 
Bank. T sold a noncapital item u in which it had a basis of $10 to S1 
for $50. T sold noncapital item v in which it had a basis of $200 to S1 
for $100. The sale of u and v are deferred intercompany transactions 
described in Sec. 1.1502-13(a)(2). S1 had separate taxable income 
calculated in accordance with Sec. 1.1502-12 of $200. In addition, S1 
sold item w in which it had a basis of $50 to T for $100. The sale of 
item w is a deferred intercompany transaction described in Sec. 1.1502-
13(a)(2). P and S2 had no items of income, loss, or deduction for 1989.
    (iv) For purposes of determining whether T has a dual consolidated 
loss in 1989 and the amount of such dual consolidated loss, T's taxable 
income (loss) is calculated under paragraph (f)(1) as follows:

 ($100)  interest expense to Bank
 ($100)  sale of item v to S1
    $40  sale of item u to S1
--------
 ($160)
 


T therefore has a dual consolidated loss of $160 for 1989.
    (v) Because T has a dual consolidated loss for the year, the 
consolidated taxable income of the P affiliated group is calculated 
without regard to the items of income, loss, or deduction of T. However, 
T is still a member of the P affiliated group. Therefore, the 
consolidated taxable income of the P group is $200 (attributable solely 
to the income of S1). The $50 gain recognized by S1 upon the sale of 
item w to T is deferred pursuant to Sec. 1.1502-13(c)(1).
    (vi) S2 may not make the positive adjustment provided for in Sec. 
1.1502-32(b)(1)(ii) to its basis in T for the dual consolidated loss 
incurred by T. However, S2 must make the negative adjustment provided 
for in Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(2)(i) for the amount of its allocable part of 
the deficit in earnings and profits of T for the taxable year. Thus, as 
provided in Sec. 1.1502-32(e)(1), S2 shall make a net negative 
adjustment to its basis in T of $160 and S2's basis in T is now $340. As 
provided in Sec. 1.1502-33(b)(4)(ii)(a), S2's earnings and profits for 
1989 must reflect S2's decrease in its basis in T stock for the taxable 
year. Since S2 has no other earnings and profits for the taxable year, 
S2 has a deficit in earnings and profits of $160 for the taxable year. 
As provided in Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(2)(i), P must make a negative 
adjustment for the amount of its allocable part of the deficit in 
earnings and profits of S2 for the taxable year. Thus, P must make a net 
negative adjustment to its basis in S2 of $160 and P's basis in S2 is 
now $840.
    Example (2). (i) The facts are the same as in Example (1), except 
that in 1990, S1 sold items u and v to X for no gain or loss. T incurred 
an interest expense of $100 on a loan from Bank. T also sold item q in 
which it had a basis of $50 to S1 for $100. T also sold item r in which 
it had a basis of $100 to Y for $300. P and S2 had no items of income, 
loss, or deduction for 1990.
    (ii) For purposes of determining whether T has a dual consolidated 
loss in 1990 and the amount of such dual consolidated loss, T's taxable 
income (loss) is:

 ($100)  interest expense to Bank
    $50  sale of item q to S1
   $200  sale of item r to Y
--------
   $150  ...............................................................
 


T therefore has no dual consolidated loss for 1990.
    (iii) Since T does not have a dual consolidated loss for the taxable 
year, the group's consolidated taxable income is calculated in 
accordance with the general rule of Sec. 1.1502-11 and not in 
accordance with the rule of Sec. 1.1503-2T(f)(2). T has separate 
taxable income calculated in accordance with Sec. 1.1502-12 of $100. On 
the disposition of items u and v outside the P affiliated group, no gain 
or loss is restored to income to T in accordance with Sec. 1.1502-
13(f)(1)(i) because the gain or loss on these items was not deferred, 
pursuant to Sec. 1.1503-2T(f)(3). The $50 gain on the sale of item q 
from T to S1 is an intercompany transaction on which the gain or loss 
recognized is deferred pursuant to Sec. 1.1502-13(c)(1). The 
consolidated taxable income of the P affiliated group computed without 
regard to the consolidated net operating loss deduction is $100.
    (iv) As provided by Sec. 1.1502-21A(c)(2) of the regulations, the 
amount of the dual consolidated loss arising in 1989 which may be 
absorbed by the P affiliated group in 1990 is $100; that is, the 
consolidated taxable income computed without regard to the consolidated 
net operating loss deduction minus such consolidated taxable income 
recomputed by excluding the items of income and deduction of T. Section 
1.1502-21A(c) allows $100 of the dual consolidated loss to be included 
in the consolidated net operating loss deduction for 1990. The 
consolidated taxable income of the P group for 1990 is $0.
    (v) S2 must make the positive adjustment provided for in Sec. 
1.1502-32(b)(1)(i) to its basis in T for the amount of its allocable 
part of the undistributed earnings and profits of T for the taxable 
year. S2 can not make the negative adjustment provided for in Sec. 
1.1502-32(b)(2)(ii) for the dual consolidated loss of T incurred in 1989 
and absorbed in 1990. Thus,

[[Page 644]]

as provided in Sec. 1.1502-32(e)(2), S2 shall make a net positive 
adjustment to its basis in T of $100 and S2's basis in T is now $440. As 
provided in Sec. 1.1502-33(b)(4)(ii)(a), S2's earnings and profits for 
1989 must reflect S2's increase in its basis in T stock for the taxable 
year. Since S2 has no other earnings and profits for the taxable year, 
S2 has earnings and profits of $100 for the taxable year. As provided in 
Sec. 1.1502-32(b)(1)(i), P must make a positive adjustment for the 
amount of its allocable part of the undistributed earnings and profits 
of S2 for the taxable year. Thus, P must make a net positive adjustment 
to its basis in S2 of $100 and P's basis in S2 is now $940.
