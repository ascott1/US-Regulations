              U.S.C. 1507, the contents of the CFR, a special edition of the

              prima facie evidence of the original documents published in 
              the Federal Register (44 U.S.C. 1510).

          It is prohibited to use NARA's official seal and the stylized Code 
              of Federal Regulations logo on any republication of this 
              material without the express, written permission of the 
              Archivist of the United States or the Archivist's designee. 
              Any person using NARA's official seals and logos in a manner 
              inconsistent with the provisions of 36 CFR part 1200 is 
              subject to the penalties specified in 18 U.S.C. 506, 701, and

                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, July 1, 2009), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in eleven separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as 
an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that 
issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after 
contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please 
notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and 
Records Administration, Washington DC 20408, or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities 
and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an 
alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in 
this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

Sec. 300.8  Child with a disability.

    (a) General. (1) Child with a disability means a child evaluated in 
accordance with Sec. Sec. 300.304 through 300.311 as having mental 
retardation, a hearing impairment (including deafness), a speech or 
language impairment, a visual impairment (including blindness), a 
serious emotional disturbance (referred to in this part as ``emotional 
disturbance''), an orthopedic impairment, autism, traumatic brain 
injury, an other health impairment, a specific learning disability, 
deaf-blindness, or multiple disabilities, and who, by reason thereof, 
needs special education and related services.
    (2)(i) Subject to paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, if it is 
determined, through an appropriate evaluation under Sec. Sec. 300.304 
through 300.311, that a child has one of the disabilities identified in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section, but only needs a related service and 
not special education, the child is not a child with a disability under 
this part.
    (ii) If, consistent with Sec. 300.39(a)(2), the related service 
required by the child is considered special education rather than a 
related service under State standards, the child would be determined to 
be a child with a disability under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (b) Children aged three through nine experiencing developmental 
delays. Child with a disability for children aged three through nine (or 
any subset of that age range, including ages three through five), may, 
subject to the conditions described in Sec. 300.111(b), include a 
child--
    (1) Who is experiencing developmental delays, as defined by the 
State and as measured by appropriate diagnostic instruments and 
procedures, in one or more of the following areas: Physical development, 
cognitive development, communication development, social or emotional 
development, or adaptive development; and
    (2) Who, by reason thereof, needs special education and related 
services.
    (c) Definitions of disability terms. The terms used in this 
definition of a child with a disability are defined as follows:
    (1)(i) Autism means a developmental disability significantly 
affecting verbal and nonverbal communication and social interaction, 
generally evident before age three, that adversely affects a child's 
educational performance. Other characteristics often associated with 
autism are engagement in repetitive activities and stereotyped 
movements, resistance to environmental change or change in daily 
routines, and unusual responses to sensory experiences.
    (ii) Autism does not apply if a child's educational performance is 
adversely affected primarily because the child has an emotional 
disturbance, as defined in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
    (iii) A child who manifests the characteristics of autism after age 
three could be identified as having autism if the criteria in paragraph 
(c)(1)(i) of this section are satisfied.
    (2) Deaf-blindness means concomitant hearing and visual impairments, 
the combination of which causes such severe communication and other 
developmental and educational needs that they cannot be accommodated in 
special education programs solely for children with deafness or children 
with blindness.
    (3) Deafness means a hearing impairment that is so severe that the 
child is impaired in processing linguistic information through hearing, 
with or without amplification, that adversely affects a child's 
educational performance.
    (4)(i) Emotional disturbance means a condition exhibiting one or 
more of the following characteristics over a long period of time and to 
a marked degree that adversely affects a child's educational 
performance:
    (A) An inability to learn that cannot be explained by intellectual, 
sensory, or health factors.
    (B) An inability to build or maintain satisfactory interpersonal 
relationships with peers and teachers.
    (C) Inappropriate types of behavior or feelings under normal 
circumstances.
    (D) A general pervasive mood of unhappiness or depression.

[[Page 13]]

    (E) A tendency to develop physical symptoms or fears associated with 
personal or school problems.
    (ii) Emotional disturbance includes schizophrenia. The term does not 
apply to children who are socially maladjusted, unless it is determined 
that they have an emotional disturbance under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of 
this section.
    (5) Hearing impairment means an impairment in hearing, whether 
permanent or fluctuating, that adversely affects a child's educational 
performance but that is not included under the definition of deafness in 
this section.
    (6) Mental retardation means significantly subaverage general 
intellectual functioning, existing concurrently with deficits in 
adaptive behavior and manifested during the developmental period, that 
adversely affects a child's educational performance.
    (7) Multiple disabilities means concomitant impairments (such as 
mental retardation-blindness or mental retardation-orthopedic 
impairment), the combination of which causes such severe educational 
needs that they cannot be accommodated in special education programs 
solely for one of the impairments. Multiple disabilities does not 
include deaf-blindness.
    (8) Orthopedic impairment means a severe orthopedic impairment that 
adversely affects a child's educational performance. The term includes 
impairments caused by a congenital anomaly, impairments caused by 
disease (e.g., poliomyelitis, bone tuberculosis), and impairments from 
other causes (e.g., cerebral palsy, amputations, and fractures or burns 
that cause contractures).
    (9) Other health impairment means having limited strength, vitality, 
or alertness, including a heightened alertness to environmental stimuli, 
that results in limited alertness with respect to the educational 
environment, that--
    (i) Is due to chronic or acute health problems such as asthma, 
attention deficit disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, 
diabetes, epilepsy, a heart condition, hemophilia, lead poisoning, 
leukemia, nephritis, rheumatic fever, sickle cell anemia, and Tourette 
syndrome; and
    (ii) Adversely affects a child's educational performance.
    (10) Specific learning disability--(i) General. Specific learning 
disability means a disorder in one or more of the basic psychological 
processes involved in understanding or in using language, spoken or 
written, that may manifest itself in the imperfect ability to listen, 
think, speak, read, write, spell, or to do mathematical calculations, 
including conditions such as perceptual disabilities, brain injury, 
minimal brain dysfunction, dyslexia, and developmental aphasia.
    (ii) Disorders not included. Specific learning disability does not 
include learning problems that are primarily the result of visual, 
hearing, or motor disabilities, of mental retardation, of emotional 
disturbance, or of environmental, cultural, or economic disadvantage.
    (11) Speech or language impairment means a communication disorder, 
such as stuttering, impaired articulation, a language impairment, or a 
voice impairment, that adversely affects a child's educational 
performance.
    (12) Traumatic brain injury means an acquired injury to the brain 
caused by an external physical force, resulting in total or partial 
functional disability or psychosocial impairment, or both, that 
adversely affects a child's educational performance. Traumatic brain 
injury applies to open or closed head injuries resulting in impairments 
in one or more areas, such as cognition; language; memory; attention; 
reasoning; abstract thinking; judgment; problem-solving; sensory, 
perceptual, and motor abilities; psychosocial behavior; physical 
functions; information processing; and speech. Traumatic brain injury 
does not apply to brain injuries that are congenital or degenerative, or 
to brain injuries induced by birth trauma.
    (13) Visual impairment including blindness means an impairment in 
vision that, even with correction, adversely affects a child's 
educational performance. The term includes both partial sight and 
blindness.

<R05>
Sec. 300.133  Expenditures.

    (a) Formula. To meet the requirement of Sec. 300.132(a), each LEA 
must spend the following on providing special education and related 
services (including direct services) to parentally-placed private school 
children with disabilities:
    (1) For children aged 3 through 21, an amount that is the same 
proportion of the LEA's total subgrant under section 611(f) of the Act 
as the number of private school children with disabilities aged 3 
through 21 who are enrolled by their parents in private, including 
religious, elementary schools and secondary schools located in the 
school district served by the LEA, is to the total number of children 
with disabilities in its jurisdiction aged 3 through 21.
    (2)(i) For children aged three through five, an amount that is the 
same proportion of the LEA's total subgrant under section 619(g) of the 
Act as the number of parentally-placed private school children with 
disabilities aged three through five who are enrolled by their parents 
in a private, including religious, elementary school located in the 
school district served by the LEA, is to the total number of children 
with disabilities in its jurisdiction aged three through five.
    (ii) As described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, children 
aged three through five are considered to be parentally-placed private 
school children with disabilities enrolled by their parents in private, 
including religious, elementary schools, if they are enrolled in a 
private school that meets the definition of elementary school in Sec. 
300.13.
    (3) If an LEA has not expended for equitable services all of the 
funds described in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section by the 
end of the fiscal year for which Congress appropriated the funds, the 
LEA must obligate the remaining funds for special education and related 
services (including direct services) to parentally-placed private school 
children with disabilities during a carry-over period of one additional 
year.
    (b) Calculating proportionate amount. In calculating the 
proportionate amount of Federal funds to be provided for parentally-
placed private school children with disabilities, the LEA, after timely 
and meaningful consultation with representatives of private schools 
under Sec. 300.134, must conduct a thorough and complete child find 
process to determine the number of parentally-placed children with 
disabilities attending private schools located in the LEA. (See Appendix 
B for an example of how proportionate share is calculated).
    (c) Annual count of the number of parentally-placed private school 
children with disabilities. (1) Each LEA must--
    (i) After timely and meaningful consultation with representatives of 
parentally-placed private school children with disabilities (consistent 
with Sec. 300.134), determine the number of parentally-placed private 
school children with disabilities attending private schools located in 
the LEA; and
    (ii) Ensure that the count is conducted on any date between October 
1 and December 1, inclusive, of each year.
    (2) The count must be used to determine the amount that the LEA must 
spend on providing special education and related services to parentally-
placed private school children with disabilities in the next subsequent 
fiscal year.
    (d) Supplement, not supplant. State and local funds may supplement 
and in no case supplant the proportionate amount of Federal funds 
required to be expended for parentally-placed private school children 
with disabilities under this part.

    (c) Consultation process. The consultation process among the LEA, 
private school officials, and representatives of parents of parentally-
placed private school children with disabilities, including how the 
process will operate throughout the school year to ensure that 
parentally-placed children with disabilities identified through the 
child find process can meaningfully participate in special education and 
related services.
    (d) Provision of special education and related services. How, where, 
and by whom special education and related services will be provided for 
parentally-placed private school children with disabilities, including a 
discussion of--
    (1) The types of services, including direct services and alternate 
service delivery mechanisms; and
    (2) How special education and related services will be apportioned 
if funds are insufficient to serve all parentally-placed private school 
children; and
    (3) How and when those decisions will be made;
    (e) Written explanation by LEA regarding services. How, if the LEA 
disagrees with the views of the private school officials on the 
provision of services or the types of services (whether provided 
directly or through a contract), the LEA will provide to the private 
school officials a written explanation of the reasons why the LEA chose 
not to provide services directly or through a contract.

Children With Disabilities Enrolled by Their Parents in Private Schools 
                          When FAPE Is at Issue


<R05>
Sec. 300.148  Placement of children by parents when FAPE is at issue.

    (a) General. This part does not require an LEA to pay for the cost 
of education, including special education and related services, of a 
child with a disability at a private school or facility if that agency 
made FAPE available to the child and the parents elected to place the 
child in a private school or facility. However, the public agency must 
include that child in the population whose needs are addressed 
consistent with Sec. Sec. 300.131 through 300.144.
    (b) Disagreements about FAPE. Disagreements between the parents and 
a public agency regarding the availability of a program appropriate for 
the child, and the question of financial reimbursement, are subject to 
the due process procedures in Sec. Sec. 300.504 through 300.520.
    (c) Reimbursement for private school placement. If the parents of a 
child with a disability, who previously received special education and 
related services under the authority of a public agency, enroll the 
child in a private preschool, elementary school, or secondary school 
without the consent of or referral by the public agency, a court or a 
hearing officer may require the agency to reimburse the parents for the 
cost of that enrollment if the court or hearing officer finds that the 
agency had not made FAPE available to the child in a timely manner prior 
to that enrollment and that the private placement is appropriate. A 
parental placement may be found to be appropriate by a hearing officer 
or a court even if it does not meet the State standards that apply to 
education provided by the SEA and LEAs.
    (d) Limitation on reimbursement. The cost of reimbursement described 
in paragraph (c) of this section may be reduced or denied--
    (1) If--
    (i) At the most recent IEP Team meeting that the parents attended 
prior to removal of the child from the public school, the parents did 
not inform the IEP Team that they were rejecting the placement proposed 
by the public agency to provide FAPE to their child, including stating 
their concerns and their intent to enroll their child in a private 
school at public expense; or
    (ii) At least ten (10) business days (including any holidays that 
occur on a business day) prior to the removal of the child from the 
public school, the parents did not give written notice to the public 
agency of the information described in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this 
section;
    (2) If, prior to the parents' removal of the child from the public 
school, the public agency informed the parents, through the notice 
requirements described in Sec. 300.503(a)(1), of its intent to evaluate 
the child (including a statement of the purpose of the evaluation that 
was appropriate and reasonable), but the parents did not make the child 
available for the evaluation; or
    (3) Upon a judicial finding of unreasonableness with respect to 
actions taken by the parents.
    (e) Exception. Notwithstanding the notice requirement in paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section, the cost of reimbursement--
    (1) Must not be reduced or denied for failure to provide the notice 
if--
    (i) The school prevented the parents from providing the notice;
    (ii) The parents had not received notice, pursuant to Sec. 300.504, 
of the notice requirement in paragraph (d)(1) of this section; or
    (iii) Compliance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section would likely 
result in physical harm to the child; and
    (2) May, in the discretion of the court or a hearing officer, not be 
reduced or denied for failure to provide this notice if--
    (i) The parents are not literate or cannot write in English; or

[[Page 37]]

    (ii) Compliance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section would likely 
result in serious emotional harm to the child.

                      Methods of Ensuring Services


<R05>
Sec. 300.154  Methods of ensuring services.

    (a) Establishing responsibility for services. The Chief Executive 
Officer of a State or designee of that officer must ensure that an 
interagency agreement or other mechanism for interagency coordination is 
in effect between each noneducational public agency described in 
paragraph (b) of this section and the SEA, in order to ensure that all 
services described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section that are needed 
to ensure FAPE are provided, including the provision of these services 
during the pendency of any dispute under paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section. The agreement or mechanism must include the following:
    (1) An identification of, or a method for defining, the financial 
responsibility of each agency for providing services described in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section to ensure FAPE to children with 
disabilities. The financial responsibility of each noneducational public 
agency described in paragraph (b) of this section, including the State 
Medicaid agency and other public insurers of children with disabilities, 
must precede the financial responsibility of the LEA (or the State 
agency responsible for developing the child's IEP).
    (2) The conditions, terms, and procedures under which an LEA must be 
reimbursed by other agencies.
    (3) Procedures for resolving interagency disputes (including 
procedures under which LEAs may initiate proceedings) under the 
agreement or other mechanism to secure reimbursement from other agencies 
or otherwise implement the provisions of the agreement or mechanism.
    (4) Policies and procedures for agencies to determine and identify 
the interagency coordination responsibilities of each agency to promote 
the coordination and timely and appropriate delivery of services 
described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (b) Obligation of noneducational public agencies. (1)(i) If any 
public agency other than an educational agency is otherwise obligated 
under Federal or State law, or assigned responsibility under State 
policy or pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, to provide or pay 
for any services that are also considered special education or related 
services (such as, but not limited to, services described in Sec. 300.5 
relating to assistive technology devices, Sec. 300.6 relating to 
assistive technology services, Sec. 300.34 relating to related 
services, Sec. 300.41 relating to supplementary aids and services, and 
Sec. 300.42 relating to transition services) that are necessary for 
ensuring FAPE to children with disabilities within the State, the public 
agency must fulfill that obligation or responsibility, either directly 
or through contract or other arrangement pursuant to paragraph (a) of 
this section or an agreement pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.
    (ii) A noneducational public agency described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) 
of this section may not disqualify an eligible

[[Page 40]]

service for Medicaid reimbursement because that service is provided in a 
school context.
    (2) If a public agency other than an educational agency fails to 
provide or pay for the special education and related services described 
in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the LEA (or State agency 
responsible for developing the child's IEP) must provide or pay for 
these services to the child in a timely manner. The LEA or State agency 
is authorized to claim reimbursement for the services from the 
noneducational public agency that failed to provide or pay for these 
services and that agency must reimburse the LEA or State agency in 
accordance with the terms of the interagency agreement or other 
mechanism described in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Special rule. The requirements of paragraph (a) of this section 
may be met through--
    (1) State statute or regulation;
    (2) Signed agreements between respective agency officials that 
clearly identify the responsibilities of each agency relating to the 
provision of services; or
    (3) Other appropriate written methods as determined by the Chief 
Executive Officer of the State or designee of that officer and approved 
by the Secretary.
    (d) Children with disabilities who are covered by public benefits or 
insurance. (1) A public agency may use the Medicaid or other public 
benefits or insurance programs in which a child participates to provide 
or pay for services required under this part, as permitted under the 
public benefits or insurance program, except as provided in paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section.
    (2) With regard to services required to provide FAPE to an eligible 
child under this part, the public agency--
    (i) May not require parents to sign up for or enroll in public 
benefits or insurance programs in order for their child to receive FAPE 
under Part B of the Act;
    (ii) May not require parents to incur an out-of-pocket expense such 
as the payment of a deductible or co-pay amount incurred in filing a 
claim for services provided pursuant to this part, but pursuant to 
paragraph (g)(2) of this section, may pay the cost that the parents 
otherwise would be required to pay;
    (iii) May not use a child's benefits under a public benefits or 
insurance program if that use would--
    (A) Decrease available lifetime coverage or any other insured 
benefit;
    (B) Result in the family paying for services that would otherwise be 
covered by the public benefits or insurance program and that are 
required for the child outside of the time the child is in school;
    (C) Increase premiums or lead to the discontinuation of benefits or 
insurance; or
    (D) Risk loss of eligibility for home and community-based waivers, 
based on aggregate health-related expenditures; and
    (iv)(A) Must obtain parental consent, consistent with Sec. 300.9, 
each time that access to public benefits or insurance is sought; and
    (B) Notify parents that the parents' refusal to allow access to 
their public benefits or insurance does not relieve the public agency of 
its responsibility to ensure that all required services are provided at 
no cost to the parents.
    (e) Children with disabilities who are covered by private insurance. 
(1) With regard to services required to provide FAPE to an eligible 
child under this part, a public agency may access the parents' private 
insurance proceeds only if the parents provide consent consistent with 
Sec. 300.9.
    (2) Each time the public agency proposes to access the parents' 
private insurance proceeds, the agency must--
    (i) Obtain parental consent in accordance with paragraph (e)(1) of 
this section; and
    (ii) Inform the parents that their refusal to permit the public 
agency to access their private insurance does not relieve the public 
agency of its responsibility to ensure that all required services are 
provided at no cost to the parents.
    (f) Use of Part B funds. (1) If a public agency is unable to obtain 
parental consent to use the parents' private insurance, or public 
benefits or insurance when the parents would incur a cost for a 
specified service required under this part, to ensure FAPE the public 
agency

[[Page 41]]

may use its Part B funds to pay for the service.
    (2) To avoid financial cost to parents who otherwise would consent 
to use private insurance, or public benefits or insurance if the parents 
would incur a cost, the public agency may use its Part B funds to pay 
the cost that the parents otherwise would have to pay to use the 
parents' benefits or insurance (e.g., the deductible or co-pay amounts).
    (g) Proceeds from public benefits or insurance or private insurance. 
(1) Proceeds from public benefits or insurance or private insurance will 
not be treated as program income for purposes of 34 CFR 80.25.
    (2) If a public agency spends reimbursements from Federal funds 
(e.g., Medicaid) for services under this part, those funds will not be 
considered ``State or local'' funds for purposes of the maintenance of 
effort provisions in Sec. Sec. 300.163 and 300.203.
    (h) Construction. Nothing in this part should be construed to alter 
the requirements imposed on a State Medicaid agency, or any other agency 
administering a public benefits or insurance program by Federal statute, 
regulations or policy under title XIX, or title XXI of the Social 
Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1396 through 1396v and 42 U.S.C. 1397aa through 
1397jj, or any other public benefits or insurance program.

their discipline or profession--
    (i) Meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section; and
    (ii) Have not had certification or licensure requirements waived on 
an emergency, temporary, or provisional basis; and

Sec. Sec. 300.158-300.159  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 300.160  Participation in assessments.

    (a) General. A State must ensure that all children with disabilities 
are included in all general State and district-wide assessment programs, 
including assessments described under section 1111 of the ESEA, 20 
U.S.C. 6311, with appropriate accommodations and alternate assessments, 
if necessary, as indicated in their respective IEPs.
    (b) Accommodation guidelines. (1) A State (or, in the case of a 
district-wide assessment, an LEA) must develop guidelines for the 
provision of appropriate accommodations.
    (2) The State's (or, in the case of a district-wide assessment, the 
LEA's) guidelines must--
    (i) Identify only those accommodations for each assessment that do 
not invalidate the score; and
    (ii) Instruct IEP Teams to select, for each assessment, only those 
accommodations that do not invalidate the score.
    (c) Alternate assessments. (1) A State (or, in the case of a 
district-wide assessment, an LEA) must develop and implement alternate 
assessments and guidelines for the participation of children with 
disabilities in alternate assessments for those children who cannot 
participate in regular assessments, even with accommodations, as 
indicated in their respective IEPs, as provided in paragraph (a) of this 
section.
    (2) For assessing the academic progress of students with 
disabilities under Title I of the ESEA, the alternate assessments and 
guidelines in paragraph (c)(1) of this section must provide for 
alternate assessments that--
    (i) Are aligned with the State's challenging academic content 
standards and challenging student academic achievement standards;
    (ii) If the State has adopted modified academic achievement 
standards permitted in 34 CFR 200.1(e), measure the achievement of 
children with disabilities meeting the State's criteria under Sec. 
200.1(e)(2) against those standards; and
    (iii) If the State has adopted alternate academic achievement 
standards permitted in 34 CFR 200.1(d), measure

[[Page 43]]

the achievement of children with the most significant cognitive 
disabilities against those standards.
    (d) Explanation to IEP Teams. A State (or in the case of a district-
wide assessment, an LEA) must provide IEP Teams with a clear explanation 
of the differences between assessments based on grade-level academic 
achievement standards and those based on modified or alternate academic 
achievement standards, including any effects of State or local policies 
on the student's education resulting from taking an alternate assessment 
based on alternate or modified academic achievement standards (such as 
whether only satisfactory performance on a regular assessment would 
qualify a student for a regular high school diploma).
    (e) Inform parents. A State (or in the case of a district-wide 
assessment, an LEA) must ensure that parents of students selected to be 
assessed based on alternate or modified academic achievement standards 
are informed that their child's achievement will be measured based on 
alternate or modified academic achievement standards.
    (f) Reports. An SEA (or, in the case of a district-wide assessment, 
an LEA) must make available to the public, and report to the public with 
the same frequency and in the same detail as it reports on the 
assessment of nondisabled children, the following:
    (1) The number of children with disabilities participating in 
regular assessments, and the number of those children who were provided 
accommodations (that did not result in an invalid score) in order to 
participate in those assessments.
    (2) The number of children with disabilities, if any, participating 
in alternate assessments based on grade-level academic achievement 
standards.
    (3) The number of children with disabilities, if any, participating 
in alternate assessments based on modified academic achievement 
standards.
    (4) The number of children with disabilities, if any, participating 
in alternate assessments based on alternate academic achievement 
standards.
    (5) Compared with the achievement of all children, including 
children with disabilities, the performance results of children with 
disabilities on regular assessments, alternate assessments based on 
grade-level academic achievement standards, alternate assessments based 
on modified academic achievement standards, and alternate assessments 
based on alternate academic achievement standards if--
    (i) The number of children participating in those assessments is 
sufficient to yield statistically reliable information; and
    (ii) Reporting that information will not reveal personally 
identifiable information about an individual student on those 
assessments.
    (g) Universal design. An SEA (or, in the case of a district-wide 
assessment, an LEA) must, to the extent possible, use universal design 
principles in developing and administering any assessments under this 
section.

Sec. 300.162  Supplementation of State, local, and other Federal funds.

    (a) Expenditures. Funds paid to a State under this part must be 
expended in accordance with all the provisions of this part.
    (b) Prohibition against commingling. (1) Funds paid to a State under 
this part must not be commingled with State funds.
    (2) The requirement in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is satisfied 
by the use of a separate accounting system that includes an audit trail 
of the expenditure of funds paid to a State under this part. Separate 
bank accounts are not required. (See 34 CFR 76.702 (Fiscal control and 
fund accounting procedures).)
    (c) State-level nonsupplanting. (1) Except as provided in Sec. 
300.203, funds paid to a State under Part B of the Act must be used to 
supplement the level of Federal, State, and local funds (including funds 
that are not under the direct control of the SEA or LEAs) expended for 
special education and related services provided to children with 
disabilities under Part B of the Act, and in no case to supplant those 
Federal, State, and local funds.
    (2) If the State provides clear and convincing evidence that all 
children

[[Page 44]]

with disabilities have available to them FAPE, the Secretary may waive, 
in whole or in part, the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section if the Secretary concurs with the evidence provided by the State

Sec. 300.163  Maintenance of State financial support.

    (a) General. A State must not reduce the amount of State financial 
support for special education and related services for children with 
disabilities, or otherwise made available because of the excess costs of 
educating those children, below the amount of that support for the 
preceding fiscal year.
    (b) Reduction of funds for failure to maintain support. The 
Secretary reduces the allocation of funds under section 611 of the Act 
for any fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the State fails 
to comply with the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section by the 
same amount by which the State fails to meet the requirement.
    (c) Waivers for exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances. The 
Secretary may waive the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section for 
a State, for one fiscal year at a time, if the Secretary determines 
that--
    (1) Granting a waiver would be equitable due to exceptional or 
uncontrollable circumstances such as a natural disaster or a precipitous 
and unforeseen decline in the financial resources of the State; or
    (2) The State meets the standard in Sec. 300.164 for a waiver of 
the requirement to supplement, and not to supplant, funds received under 
Part B of the Act.
    (d) Subsequent years. If, for any fiscal year, a State fails to meet 
the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, including any year for 
which the State is granted a waiver under paragraph (c) of this section, 
the financial support required of the State in future years under 
paragraph (a) of this section shall be the amount that would have been 
required in the absence of that failure and not the reduced level of the 
State's support.

Sec. 300.164  Waiver of requirement regarding supplementing and not 
supplanting with Part B funds.

    (a) Except as provided under Sec. Sec. 300.202 through 300.205, 
funds paid to a State under Part B of the Act must be used to supplement 
and increase the level of Federal, State, and local funds (including 
funds that are not under the direct control of SEAs or LEAs) expended 
for special education and related services provided to children with 
disabilities under Part B of the Act and in no case to supplant those 
Federal, State, and local funds. A State may use funds it retains under 
Sec. 300.704(a) and (b) without regard to the prohibition on 
supplanting other funds.
    (b) If a State provides clear and convincing evidence that all 
eligible children with disabilities throughout the State have FAPE 
available to them, the Secretary may waive for a period of one year in 
whole or in part the requirement under Sec. 300.162 (regarding State-
level nonsupplanting) if the Secretary concurs with the evidence 
provided by the State.
    (c) If a State wishes to request a waiver under this section, it 
must submit to the Secretary a written request that includes--
    (1) An assurance that FAPE is currently available, and will remain 
available throughout the period that a waiver would be in effect, to all 
eligible children with disabilities throughout the State, regardless of 
the public agency that is responsible for providing FAPE to them. The 
assurance must be signed by an official who has the authority to provide 
that assurance as it applies to all eligible children with disabilities 
in the State;
    (2) All evidence that the State wishes the Secretary to consider in 
determining whether all eligible children with disabilities have FAPE 
available to them, setting forth in detail--
    (i) The basis on which the State has concluded that FAPE is 
available to all eligible children in the State; and

[[Page 45]]

    (ii) The procedures that the State will implement to ensure that 
FAPE remains available to all eligible children in the State, which must 
include--
    (A) The State's procedures under Sec. 300.111 for ensuring that all 
eligible children are identified, located and evaluated;
    (B) The State's procedures for monitoring public agencies to ensure 
that they comply with all requirements of this part;
    (C) The State's complaint procedures under Sec. Sec. 300.151 
through 300.153; and
    (D) The State's hearing procedures under Sec. Sec. 300.511 through 
300.516 and Sec. Sec. 300.530 through 300.536;
    (3) A summary of all State and Federal monitoring reports, and State 
complaint decisions (see Sec. Sec. 300.151 through 300.153) and hearing 
decisions (see Sec. Sec. 300.511 through 300.516 and Sec. Sec. 300.530 
through 300.536), issued within three years prior to the date of the 
State's request for a waiver under this section, that includes any 
finding that FAPE has not been available to one or more eligible 
children, and evidence that FAPE is now available to all children 
addressed in those reports or decisions; and
    (4) Evidence that the State, in determining that FAPE is currently 
available to all eligible children with disabilities in the State, has 
consulted with the State advisory panel under Sec. 300.167.
    (d) If the Secretary determines that the request and supporting 
evidence submitted by the State makes a prima facie showing that FAPE 
is, and will remain, available to all eligible children with 
disabilities in the State, the Secretary, after notice to the public 
throughout the State, conducts a public hearing at which all interested 
persons and organizations may present evidence regarding the following 
issues:
    (1) Whether FAPE is currently available to all eligible children 
with disabilities in the State.
    (2) Whether the State will be able to ensure that FAPE remains 
available to all eligible children with disabilities in the State if the 
Secretary provides the requested waiver.
    (e) Following the hearing, the Secretary, based on all submitted 
evidence, will provide a waiver, in whole or in part, for a period of 
one year if the Secretary finds that the State has provided clear and 
convincing evidence that FAPE is currently available to all eligible 
children with disabilities in the State, and the State will be able to 
ensure that FAPE remains available to all eligible children with 
disabilities in the State if the Secretary provides the requested 
waiver.
    (f) A State may receive a waiver of the requirement of section 
612(a)(18)(A) of the Act and Sec. 300.164 if it satisfies the 
requirements of paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section.
    (g) The Secretary may grant subsequent waivers for a period of one 
year each, if the Secretary determines that the State has provided clear 
and convincing evidence that all eligible children with disabilities 
throughout the State have, and will continue to have throughout the one-
year period of the waiver, FAPE available to them.

    (4) In order to meet its responsibility under paragraphs (b)(2), 
(b)(3), and (c) of this section to ensure that children with 
disabilities who need instructional materials in accessible formats are 
provided those materials in a timely manner, the SEA must ensure that 
all public agencies take all reasonable steps to provide instructional 
materials in accessible formats to children with disabilities who need 
those instructional materials at the same time as other children receive 
instructional materials.
    (c) Preparation and delivery of files. If an SEA chooses to 
coordinate with the NIMAC, as of December 3, 2006, the SEA must--
    (1) As part of any print instructional materials adoption process, 
procurement contract, or other practice or instrument used for purchase 
of print instructional materials, enter into a written contract with the

produced in, or may be rendered in, specialized formats.
    (2) Provide instructional materials to blind persons or other 
persons with print disabilities in a timely manner.

<R05>
Sec. 300.201  Consistency with State policies.

    The LEA, in providing for the education of children with 
disabilities within its jurisdiction, must have in effect policies, 
procedures, and programs that are consistent with the State policies and

<R05>
Sec. 300.202  Use of amounts.

    (a) General. Amounts provided to the LEA under Part B of the Act--
    (1) Must be expended in accordance with the applicable provisions of 
this part;
    (2) Must be used only to pay the excess costs of providing special 
education and related services to children with disabilities, consistent 
with paragraph (b) of this section; and
    (3) Must be used to supplement State, local, and other Federal funds 
and not to supplant those funds.
    (b) Excess cost requirement--(1) General. (i) The excess cost 
requirement prevents an LEA from using funds provided under Part B of 
the Act to pay for all of the costs directly attributable to the 
education of a child with a disability, subject to paragraph (b)(1)(ii) 
of this section.
    (ii) The excess cost requirement does not prevent an LEA from using 
Part B funds to pay for all of the costs directly attributable to the 
education of a child with a disability in any of the ages 3, 4, 5, 18, 
19, 20, or 21, if no local or State funds are available for nondisabled 
children of these ages. However, the LEA must comply with the 
nonsupplanting and other requirements

[[Page 56]]

of this part in providing the education and services for these children.
    (2)(i) An LEA meets the excess cost requirement if it has spent at 
least a minimum average amount for the education of its children with 
disabilities before funds under Part B of the Act are used.
    (ii) The amount described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section is 
determined in accordance with the definition of excess costs in Sec. 
300.16. That amount may not include capital outlay or debt service.
    (3) If two or more LEAs jointly establish eligibility in accordance 
with Sec. 300.223, the minimum average amount is the average of the 
combined minimum average amounts determined in accordance with the 
definition of excess costs in Sec. 300.16 in those agencies for 
elementary or secondary school students, as the case may be.

Sec. 300.203  Maintenance of effort.

    (a) General. Except as provided in Sec. Sec. 300.204 and 300.205, 
funds provided to an LEA under Part B of the Act must not be used to 
reduce the level of expenditures for the education of children with 
disabilities made by the LEA from local funds below the level of those 
expenditures for the preceding fiscal year.
    (b) Standard. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section, the SEA must determine that an LEA complies with paragraph (a) 
of this section for purposes of establishing the LEA's eligibility for 
an award for a fiscal year if the LEA budgets, for the education of 
children with disabilities, at least the same total or per capita amount 
from either of the following sources as the LEA spent for that purpose 
from the same source for the most recent prior year for which 
information is available:
    (i) Local funds only.
    (ii) The combination of State and local funds.
    (2) An LEA that relies on paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section for 
any fiscal year must ensure that the amount of local funds it budgets 
for the education of children with disabilities in that year is at least 
the same, either in total or per capita, as the amount it spent for that 
purpose in the most recent fiscal year for which information is 
available and the standard in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section was 
used to establish its compliance with this section.
    (3) The SEA may not consider any expenditures made from funds 
provided by the Federal Government for which the SEA is required to 
account to the Federal Government or for which the LEA is required to 
account to the Federal Government directly or through the SEA in 
determining an LEA's compliance with the requirement in paragraph (a) of 
this section.

Sec. 300.204  Exception to maintenance of effort.

    Notwithstanding the restriction in Sec. 300.203(a), an LEA may 
reduce the level of expenditures by the LEA under Part B of the Act 
below the level of those expenditures for the preceding fiscal year if 
the reduction is attributable to any of the following:
    (a) The voluntary departure, by retirement or otherwise, or 
departure for just cause, of special education or related services 
personnel.
    (b) A decrease in the enrollment of children with disabilities.
    (c) The termination of the obligation of the agency, consistent with 
this part, to provide a program of special education to a particular 
child with a disability that is an exceptionally costly program, as 
determined by the SEA, because the child--
    (1) Has left the jurisdiction of the agency;
    (2) Has reached the age at which the obligation of the agency to 
provide FAPE to the child has terminated; or
    (3) No longer needs the program of special education.
    (d) The termination of costly expenditures for long-term purchases, 
such as the acquisition of equipment or the construction of school 
facilities.

Sec. 300.205  Adjustment to local fiscal efforts in certain fiscal years.

    (a) Amounts in excess. Notwithstanding Sec. 300.202(a)(2) and (b) 
and Sec. 300.203(a), and except as provided in paragraph (d) of this 
section and Sec. 300.230(e)(2), for any fiscal year for which the 
allocation received by an LEA under Sec. 300.705 exceeds the amount the 
LEA received for the previous fiscal year, the LEA may reduce the level 
of expenditures otherwise required by Sec. 300.203(a) by not more than 
50 percent of the amount of that excess.
    (b) Use of amounts to carry out activities under ESEA. If an LEA 
exercises the authority under paragraph (a) of this section, the LEA 
must use an amount of local funds equal to the reduction in expenditures 
under paragraph (a) of this section to carry out activities that could 
be supported with funds under the ESEA regardless of whether the LEA is 
using funds under the ESEA for those activities.
    (c) State prohibition. Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this 
section, if an SEA determines that an LEA is unable to establish and 
maintain programs of FAPE that meet the requirements of section 613(a) 
of the Act and this part or the SEA has taken action against the LEA 
under section 616 of the Act and subpart F of these regulations, the SEA 
must prohibit the LEA from reducing the level of expenditures under 
paragraph (a) of this section for that fiscal year.
    (d) Special rule. The amount of funds expended by an LEA for early 
intervening services under Sec. 300.226 shall count toward the maximum 
amount of expenditures that the LEA may reduce under paragraph (a) of 
this section.

funds received under Part B of the Act for any fiscal year to carry out 
a schoolwide program under section 1114 of the ESEA, except that the 
amount used in any schoolwide program may not exceed--
    (1)(i) The amount received by the LEA under Part B of the Act for 
that fiscal year; divided by
    (ii) The number of children with disabilities in the jurisdiction of 
the LEA; and multiplied by
    (2) The number of children with disabilities participating in the 
schoolwide program.
    (b) Funding conditions. The funds described in paragraph (a) of this 
section are subject to the following conditions:

300.162(b), funds provided to an LEA under Part B of the Act may be used 
for the following activities:
    (1) Services and aids that also benefit nondisabled children. For 
the costs of special education and related services, and supplementary

    (a) Rights of children with disabilities. Children with disabilities 
who attend public charter schools and their parents retain all rights 
under this part.
    (b) Charter schools that are public schools of the LEA. (1) In 
carrying out Part B of the Act and these regulations with respect to 
charter schools that are public schools of the LEA, the LEA must--
    (i) Serve children with disabilities attending those charter schools 
in the same manner as the LEA serves children with disabilities in its 
other schools, including providing supplementary and related services on 
site at the charter school to the same extent to which the LEA has a 
policy or practice of providing such services on the site to its other 
public schools; and
    (ii) Provide funds under Part B of the Act to those charter 
schools--
    (A) On the same basis as the LEA provides funds to the LEA's other 
public schools, including proportional distribution based on relative 
enrollment of children with disabilities; and
    (B) At the same time as the LEA distributes other Federal funds to 
the LEA's other public schools, consistent with the State's charter 
school law.
    (2) If the public charter school is a school of an LEA that receives 
funding under Sec. 300.705 and includes other public schools--
    (i) The LEA is responsible for ensuring that the requirements of 
this part are met, unless State law assigns that responsibility to some 
other entity; and
    (ii) The LEA must meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section.
    (c) Public charter schools that are LEAs. If the public charter 
school is an LEA, consistent with Sec. 300.28, that receives funding 
under Sec. 300.705, that charter school is responsible for ensuring 
that the requirements of this part are met, unless State law assigns 
that responsibility to some other entity.
    (d) Public charter schools that are not an LEA or a school that is 
part of an LEA. (1) If the public charter school is not an LEA receiving 
funding under Sec. 300.705, or a school that is part of an LEA 
receiving funding under Sec. 300.705, the SEA is responsible for 
ensuring that the requirements of this part are met.
    (2) Paragraph (d)(1) of this section does not preclude a State from 
assigning initial responsibility for ensuring

with this part, consistent with Sec. 300.149.

materials to blind persons or other persons with print disabilities in a 
timely manner.

in accessible formats but are not included under the definition of blind 
or other persons with print disabilities in Sec. 300.172(e)(1)(i) or

intervening services, which may include interagency financing 
structures, for students in kindergarten through grade 12 (with a 
particular emphasis on students in kindergarten through grade three) who 
are not currently identified as needing special education or related 
services, but who need additional academic and behavioral support to

transmit the statement to the same extent that the disciplinary 
information is included in, and transmitted with, the student records of 
nondisabled children.
    (b) The statement may include a description of any behavior engaged 
in by the child that required disciplinary action, a description of the 
disciplinary action taken, and any other information that is relevant to 
the safety of the child and other individuals involved with the child.
    (c) If the State adopts such a policy, and the child transfers from 
one school to another, the transmission of any of the child's records 
must include both the child's current IEP and any statement of current 
or previous disciplinary action that has been taken against the child.

Sec. 300.230  SEA flexibility.

    (a) Adjustment to State fiscal effort in certain fiscal years. For 
any fiscal year for which the allotment received by a State under Sec. 
300.703 exceeds the amount the State received for the previous fiscal 
year and if the State in school year 2003-2004 or any subsequent school 
year pays or reimburses all LEAs within the State from State revenue 100 
percent of the non-Federal share of the costs of special education and 
related services, the SEA, notwithstanding Sec. Sec. 300.162 through 
300.163 (related to State-level nonsupplanting and maintenance of 
effort), and Sec. 300.175 (related to direct services by the SEA) may 
reduce the level of expenditures from State sources for the education of 
children with disabilities by not more than 50 percent of the amount of 
such excess.
    (b) Prohibition. Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, if 
the Secretary determines that an SEA is unable to establish, maintain, 
or oversee programs of FAPE that meet the requirements of this part, or 
that the State needs assistance, intervention, or substantial 
intervention under Sec. 300.603, the Secretary prohibits the SEA from 
exercising the authority in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Education activities. If an SEA exercises the authority under 
paragraph (a) of this section, the agency must use funds from State 
sources, in an amount equal to the amount of the reduction under 
paragraph (a) of this section, to support activities authorized under 
the ESEA, or to support need-based student or teacher higher education 
programs.
    (d) Report. For each fiscal year for which an SEA exercises the 
authority under paragraph (a) of this section, the SEA must report to 
the Secretary--
    (1) The amount of expenditures reduced pursuant to that paragraph; 
and
    (2) The activities that were funded pursuant to paragraph (c) of 
this section.
    (e) Limitation. (1) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, 
an SEA

[[Page 63]]

may not reduce the level of expenditures described in paragraph (a) of 
this section if any LEA in the State would, as a result of such 
reduction, receive less than 100 percent of the amount necessary to 
ensure that all children with disabilities served by the LEA receive 
FAPE from the combination of Federal funds received under Part B of the 
Act and State funds received from the SEA.
    (2) If an SEA exercises the authority under paragraph (a) of this 
section, LEAs in the State may not reduce local effort under Sec. 
300.205 by more than the reduction in the State funds they receive.

<R05>
Sec. 300.300  Parental consent.

    (a) Parental consent for initial evaluation. (1)(i) The public 
agency proposing to conduct an initial evaluation to determine if a 
child qualifies as a child with a disability under Sec. 300.8 must, 
after providing notice consistent with Sec. Sec. 300.503 and 300.504, 
obtain informed consent, consistent with Sec. 300.9, from the parent of 
the child before conducting the evaluation.
    (ii) Parental consent for initial evaluation must not be construed 
as consent for initial provision of special education and related 
services.
    (iii) The public agency must make reasonable efforts to obtain the 
informed consent from the parent for an initial evaluation to determine 
whether the child is a child with a disability.
    (2) For initial evaluations only, if the child is a ward of the 
State and is not residing with the child's parent, the public agency is 
not required to obtain informed consent from the parent for an initial 
evaluation to determine whether the child is a child with a disability 
if--
    (i) Despite reasonable efforts to do so, the public agency cannot 
discover the whereabouts of the parent of the child;
    (ii) The rights of the parents of the child have been terminated in 
accordance with State law; or
    (iii) The rights of the parent to make educational decisions have 
been subrogated by a judge in accordance with State law and consent for 
an initial evaluation has been given by an individual appointed by the 
judge to represent the child.
    (3)(i) If the parent of a child enrolled in public school or seeking 
to be enrolled in public school does not provide consent for initial 
evaluation under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, or the parent fails 
to respond to a request to provide consent, the public agency may, but 
is not required to, pursue the initial evaluation of the child by 
utilizing the procedural safeguards in subpart E of this part (including 
the mediation procedures under Sec. 300.506 or the due process 
procedures under Sec. Sec. 300.507 through 300.516), if appropriate, 
except to the extent inconsistent with State law relating to such 
parental consent.
    (ii) The public agency does not violate its obligation under Sec. 
300.111 and Sec. Sec. 300.301 through 300.311 if it declines to pursue 
the evaluation.
    (b) Parental consent for services. (1) A public agency that is 
responsible for making FAPE available to a child with a disability must 
obtain informed consent from the parent of the child before the initial 
provision of special education and related services to the child.
    (2) The public agency must make reasonable efforts to obtain 
informed consent from the parent for the initial provision of special 
education and related services to the child.
    (3) If the parent of a child fails to respond to a request for, or 
refuses to consent to, the initial provision of special education and 
related services, the public agency--
    (i) May not use the procedures in subpart E of this part (including 
the mediation procedures under Sec. 300.506 or the due process 
procedures under Sec. Sec. 300.507 through 300.516) in order to obtain 
agreement or a ruling that the services may be provided to the child;
    (ii) Will not be considered to be in violation of the requirement to 
make FAPE available to the child because of the failure to provide the 
child with

[[Page 64]]

the special education and related services for which the parent refuses 
to or fails to provide consent; and
    (iii) Is not required to convene an IEP Team meeting or develop an 
IEP under Sec. Sec. 300.320 and 300.324 for the child.
    (4) If, at any time subsequent to the initial provision of special 
education and related services, the parent of a child revokes consent in 
writing for the continued provision of special education and related 
services, the public agency--
    (i) May not continue to provide special education and related 
services to the child, but must provide prior written notice in 
accordance with Sec. 300.503 before ceasing the provision of special 
education and related services;
    (ii) May not use the procedures in subpart E of this part (including 
the mediation procedures under Sec. 300.506 or the due process 
procedures under Sec. Sec. 300.507 through 300.516) in order to obtain 
agreement or a ruling that the services may be provided to the child;
    (iii) Will not be considered to be in violation of the requirement 
to make FAPE available to the child because of the failure to provide 
the child with further special education and related services; and
    (iv) Is not required to convene an IEP Team meeting or develop an 
IEP under Sec. Sec. 300.320 and 300.324 for the child for further 
provision of special education and related services.
    (c) Parental consent for reevaluations. (1) Subject to paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section, each public agency--
    (i) Must obtain informed parental consent, in accordance with Sec. 
300.300(a)(1), prior to conducting any reevaluation of a child with a 
disability.
    (ii) If the parent refuses to consent to the reevaluation, the 
public agency may, but is not required to, pursue the reevaluation by 
using the consent override procedures described in paragraph (a)(3) of 
this section.
    (iii) The public agency does not violate its obligation under Sec. 
300.111 and Sec. Sec. 300.301 through 300.311 if it declines to pursue 
the evaluation or reevaluation.
    (2) The informed parental consent described in paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section need not be obtained if the public agency can demonstrate 
that--
    (i) It made reasonable efforts to obtain such consent; and
    (ii) The child's parent has failed to respond.
    (d) Other consent requirements.
    (1) Parental consent is not required before--
    (i) Reviewing existing data as part of an evaluation or a 
reevaluation; or
    (ii) Administering a test or other evaluation that is administered 
to all children unless, before administration of that test or 
evaluation, consent is required of parents of all children.
    (2) In addition to the parental consent requirements described in 
paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, a State may require 
parental consent for other services and activities under this part if it 
ensures that each public agency in the State establishes and implements 
effective procedures to ensure that a parent's refusal to consent does 
not result in a failure to provide the child with FAPE.
    (3) A public agency may not use a parent's refusal to consent to one 
service or activity under paragraphs (a), (b), (c), or (d)(2) of this 
section to deny the parent or child any other service, benefit, or 
activity of the public agency, except as required by this part.
    (4)(i) If a parent of a child who is home schooled or placed in a 
private school by the parents at their own expense does not provide 
consent for the initial evaluation or the reevaluation, or the parent 
fails to respond to a request to provide consent, the public agency may 
not use the consent override procedures (described in paragraphs (a)(3) 
and (c)(1) of this section); and
    (ii) The public agency is not required to consider the child as

                      Evaluations and Reevaluations


<R05>
Sec. 300.301  Initial evaluations.

    (a) General. Each public agency must conduct a full and individual 
initial evaluation, in accordance with Sec. Sec. 300.304 through 
300.306, before the initial provision of special education and related 
services to a child with a disability under this part.
    (b) Request for initial evaluation. Consistent with the consent 
requirements in Sec. 300.300, either a parent of a child or a public 
agency may initiate a request for an initial evaluation to determine if 
the child is a child with a disability.
    (c) Procedures for initial evaluation. The initial evaluation--
    (1)(i) Must be conducted within 60 days of receiving parental 
consent for the evaluation; or
    (ii) If the State establishes a timeframe within which the 
evaluation must be conducted, within that timeframe; and
    (2) Must consist of procedures--
    (i) To determine if the child is a child with a disability under 
Sec. 300.8; and
    (ii) To determine the educational needs of the child.
    (d) Exception. The timeframe described in paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section does not apply to a public agency if--
    (1) The parent of a child repeatedly fails or refuses to produce the 
child for the evaluation; or
    (2) A child enrolls in a school of another public agency after the 
relevant timeframe in paragraph (c)(1) of this section has begun, and 
prior to a determination by the child's previous public agency as to 
whether the child is a child with a disability under Sec. 300.8.
    (e) The exception in paragraph (d)(2) of this section applies only 
if the subsequent public agency is making sufficient progress to ensure 
a prompt completion of the evaluation, and the parent and subsequent 
public agency agree to a specific time when the evaluation will be 
completed.

<R05>
Sec. 300.302  Screening for instructional purposes is not evaluation.

    The screening of a student by a teacher or specialist to determine 
appropriate instructional strategies for curriculum implementation shall 
not be considered to be an evaluation for eligibility for special 
education and related services.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1414(a)(1)(E))


<R05>
Sec. 300.303  Reevaluations.

    (a) General. A public agency must ensure that a reevaluation of each 
child with a disability is conducted in accordance with Sec. Sec. 
300.304 through 300.311--
    (1) If the public agency determines that the educational or related 
services needs, including improved academic achievement and functional 
performance, of the child warrant a reevaluation; or
    (2) If the child's parent or teacher requests a reevaluation.
    (b) Limitation. A reevaluation conducted under paragraph (a) of this 
section--
    (1) May occur not more than once a year, unless the parent and the 
public agency agree otherwise; and
    (2) Must occur at least once every 3 years, unless the parent and 
the public agency agree that a reevaluation is unnecessary.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1414(a)(2))


<R05>
Sec. 300.304  Evaluation procedures.

    (a) Notice. The public agency must provide notice to the parents of 
a child with a disability, in accordance with Sec. 300.503, that 
describes any evaluation procedures the agency proposes to conduct.
    (b) Conduct of evaluation. In conducting the evaluation, the public 
agency must--
    (1) Use a variety of assessment tools and strategies to gather 
relevant functional, developmental, and academic information about the 
child, including information provided by the parent, that may assist in 
determining--
    (i) Whether the child is a child with a disability under Sec. 
300.8; and
    (ii) The content of the child's IEP, including information related 
to enabling the child to be involved in and

[[Page 66]]

progress in the general education curriculum (or for a preschool child, 
to participate in appropriate activities);
    (2) Not use any single measure or assessment as the sole criterion 
for determining whether a child is a child with a disability and for 
determining an appropriate educational program for the child; and
    (3) Use technically sound instruments that may assess the relative 
contribution of cognitive and behavioral factors, in addition to 
physical or developmental factors.
    (c) Other evaluation procedures. Each public agency must ensure 
that--
    (1) Assessments and other evaluation materials used to assess a 
child under this part--
    (i) Are selected and administered so as not to be discriminatory on 
a racial or cultural basis;
    (ii) Are provided and administered in the child's native language or 
other mode of communication and in the form most likely to yield 
accurate information on what the child knows and can do academically, 
developmentally, and functionally, unless it is clearly not feasible to 
so provide or administer;
    (iii) Are used for the purposes for which the assessments or 
measures are valid and reliable;
    (iv) Are administered by trained and knowledgeable personnel; and
    (v) Are administered in accordance with any instructions provided by 
the producer of the assessments.
    (2) Assessments and other evaluation materials include those 
tailored to assess specific areas of educational need and not merely 
those that are designed to provide a single general intelligence 
quotient.
    (3) Assessments are selected and administered so as best to ensure 
that if an assessment is administered to a child with impaired sensory, 
manual, or speaking skills, the assessment results accurately reflect 
the child's aptitude or achievement level or whatever other factors the 
test purports to measure, rather than reflecting the child's impaired 
sensory, manual, or speaking skills (unless those skills are the factors 
that the test purports to measure).
    (4) The child is assessed in all areas related to the suspected 
disability, including, if appropriate, health, vision, hearing, social 
and emotional status, general intelligence, academic performance, 
communicative status, and motor abilities;
    (5) Assessments of children with disabilities who transfer from one 
public agency to another public agency in the same school year are 
coordinated with those children's prior and subsequent schools, as 
necessary and as expeditiously as possible, consistent with Sec. 
300.301(d)(2) and (e), to ensure prompt completion of full evaluations.
    (6) In evaluating each child with a disability under Sec. Sec. 
300.304 through 300.306, the evaluation is sufficiently comprehensive to 
identify all of the child's special education and related services 
needs, whether or not commonly linked to the disability category in 
which the child has been classified.
    (7) Assessment tools and strategies that provide relevant 
information that directly assists persons in determining the educational 
needs of the child are provided.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1414(b)(1)-(3), 1412(a)(6)(B))


<R05>
Sec. 300.305  Additional requirements for evaluations and reevaluations.

    (a) Review of existing evaluation data. As part of an initial 
evaluation (if appropriate) and as part of any reevaluation under this 
part, the IEP Team and other qualified professionals, as appropriate, 
must--
    (1) Review existing evaluation data on the child, including--
    (i) Evaluations and information provided by the parents of the 
child;
    (ii) Current classroom-based, local, or State assessments, and 
classroom-based observations; and
    (iii) Observations by teachers and related services providers; and
    (2) On the basis of that review, and input from the child's parents, 
identify what additional data, if any, are needed to determine--
    (i)(A) Whether the child is a child with a disability, as defined in 
Sec. 300.8, and the educational needs of the child; or
    (B) In case of a reevaluation of a child, whether the child 
continues to

[[Page 67]]

have such a disability, and the educational needs of the child;
    (ii) The present levels of academic achievement and related 
developmental needs of the child;
    (iii)(A) Whether the child needs special education and related 
services; or
    (B) In the case of a reevaluation of a child, whether the child 
continues to need special education and related services; and
    (iv) Whether any additions or modifications to the special education 
and related services are needed to enable the child to meet the 
measurable annual goals set out in the IEP of the child and to 
participate, as appropriate, in the general education curriculum.
    (b) Conduct of review. The group described in paragraph (a) of this 
section may conduct its review without a meeting.
    (c) Source of data. The public agency must administer such 
assessments and other evaluation measures as may be needed to produce 
the data identified under paragraph (a) of this section.
    (d) Requirements if additional data are not needed. (1) If the IEP 
Team and other qualified professionals, as appropriate, determine that 
no additional data are needed to determine whether the child continues 
to be a child with a disability, and to determine the child's 
educational needs, the public agency must notify the child's parents 
of--
    (i) That determination and the reasons for the determination; and
    (ii) The right of the parents to request an assessment to determine 
whether the child continues to be a child with a disability, and to 
determine the child's educational needs.
    (2) The public agency is not required to conduct the assessment 
described in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section unless requested to do 
so by the child's parents.
    (e) Evaluations before change in eligibility. (1) Except as provided 
in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, a public agency must evaluate a 
child with a disability in accordance with Sec. Sec. 300.304 through 
300.311 before determining that the child is no longer a child with a 
disability.
    (2) The evaluation described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section is 
not required before the termination of a child's eligibility under this 
part due to graduation from secondary school with a regular diploma, or 
due to exceeding the age eligibility for FAPE under State law.
    (3) For a child whose eligibility terminates under circumstances 
described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, a public agency must 
provide the child with a summary of the child's academic achievement and 
functional performance, which shall include recommendations on how to 
assist the child in meeting the child's postsecondary goals.

<R05>
Sec. 300.307  Specific learning disabilities.

    (a) General. A State must adopt, consistent with Sec. 300.309, 
criteria for determining whether a child has a specific learning 
disability as defined in Sec. 300.8(c)(10). In addition, the criteria 
adopted by the State--
    (1) Must not require the use of a severe discrepancy between 
intellectual ability and achievement for determining whether a child has 
a specific learning disability, as defined in Sec. 300.8(c)(10);
    (2) Must permit the use of a process based on the child's response 
to scientific, research-based intervention; and
    (3) May permit the use of other alternative research-based 
procedures for determining whether a child has a specific learning 
disability, as defined in Sec. 300.8(c)(10).
    (b) Consistency with State criteria. A public agency must use the 
State criteria adopted pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section in 
determining whether a child has a specific learning disability.

<R05>
Sec. 300.308  Additional group members.

    The determination of whether a child suspected of having a specific 
learning disability is a child with a disability as defined in Sec. 
300.8, must be made by the child's parents and a team of qualified 
professionals, which must include--
    (a)(1) The child's regular teacher; or
    (2) If the child does not have a regular teacher, a regular 
classroom teacher qualified to teach a child of his or her age; or
    (3) For a child of less than school age, an individual qualified by 
the SEA to teach a child of his or her age; and
    (b) At least one person qualified to conduct individual diagnostic 
examinations of children, such as a school psychologist, speech-language 
pathologist, or remedial reading teacher.

<R05>
Sec. 300.309  Determining the existence of a specific learning disability.

    (a) The group described in Sec. 300.306 may determine that a child 
has a specific learning disability, as defined in Sec. 300.8(c)(10), 
if--
    (1) The child does not achieve adequately for the child's age or to 
meet State-approved grade-level standards in one or more of the 
following areas, when provided with learning experiences and instruction 
appropriate for the child's age or State-approved grade-level standards:
    (i) Oral expression.
    (ii) Listening comprehension.
    (iii) Written expression.
    (iv) Basic reading skill.
    (v) Reading fluency skills.
    (vi) Reading comprehension.
    (vii) Mathematics calculation.
    (viii) Mathematics problem solving.
    (2)(i) The child does not make sufficient progress to meet age or 
State-approved grade-level standards in one or more of the areas 
identified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section when using a process 
based on the child's response to scientific, research-based 
intervention; or
    (ii) The child exhibits a pattern of strengths and weaknesses in 
performance, achievement, or both, relative to age, State-approved 
grade-level standards, or intellectual development, that is determined 
by the group to be relevant to the identification of a specific learning 
disability, using appropriate assessments, consistent with Sec. Sec. 
300.304 and 300.305; and

[[Page 69]]

    (3) The group determines that its findings under paragraphs (a)(1) 
and (2) of this section are not primarily the result of--
    (i) A visual, hearing, or motor disability;
    (ii) Mental retardation;
    (iii) Emotional disturbance;
    (iv) Cultural factors;
    (v) Environmental or economic disadvantage; or
    (vi) Limited English proficiency.
    (b) To ensure that underachievement in a child suspected of having a

at reasonable intervals, reflecting formal assessment of student 
progress during instruction, which was provided to the child's parents.
    (c) The public agency must promptly request parental consent to 
evaluate the child to determine if the child needs special education and 
related services, and must adhere to the timeframes described in 
Sec. Sec. 300.301 and 300.303, unless extended by mutual written 
agreement of the child's parents and a group of qualified professionals, 
as described in Sec. 300.306(a)(1)--

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1414(d)(1)(B)(i))


<R05>
Sec. 300.323  When IEPs must be in effect.

    (a) General. At the beginning of each school year, each public 
agency must have in effect, for each child with a disability within its 
jurisdiction, an IEP, as defined in Sec. 300.320.
    (b) IEP or IFSP for children aged three through five. (1) In the 
case of a child with a disability aged three through five (or, at the 
discretion of the SEA, a two-year-old child with a disability who will 
turn age three during the school year), the IEP Team must consider an 
IFSP that contains the IFSP content (including the natural environments 
statement) described in section 636(d) of the Act and its implementing 
regulations (including an educational component that promotes school 
readiness and incorporates pre-literacy, language, and numeracy skills 
for children with IFSPs under this section who are at least three years 
of age), and that is developed in accordance with the IEP procedures 
under this part. The IFSP may serve as the IEP of the child, if using 
the IFSP as the IEP is--
    (i) Consistent with State policy; and
    (ii) Agreed to by the agency and the child's parents.
    (2) In implementing the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section, the public agency must--
    (i) Provide to the child's parents a detailed explanation of the 
differences between an IFSP and an IEP; and
    (ii) If the parents choose an IFSP, obtain written informed consent 
from the parents.
    (c) Initial IEPs; provision of services. Each public agency must 
ensure that--
    (1) A meeting to develop an IEP for a child is conducted within 30 
days of a determination that the child needs special education and 
related services; and
    (2) As soon as possible following development of the IEP, special 
education and related services are made available to the child in 
accordance with the child's IEP.
    (d) Accessibility of child's IEP to teachers and others. Each public 
agency must ensure that--
    (1) The child's IEP is accessible to each regular education teacher, 
special education teacher, related services provider, and any other 
service provider who is responsible for its implementation; and
    (2) Each teacher and provider described in paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section is informed of--
    (i) His or her specific responsibilities related to implementing the 
child's IEP; and
    (ii) The specific accommodations, modifications, and supports that 
must be provided for the child in accordance with the IEP.
    (e) IEPs for children who transfer public agencies in the same 
State. If a child with a disability (who had an IEP that was in effect 
in a previous public agency in the same State) transfers to a new public 
agency in the same State, and enrolls in a new school within the same 
school year, the new public agency (in consultation with the parents) 
must provide FAPE to the child (including services comparable to those 
described in the child's IEP from the previous public agency), until the 
new public agency either--

[[Page 74]]

    (1) Adopts the child's IEP from the previous public agency; or
    (2) Develops, adopts, and implements a new IEP that meets the 
applicable requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.320 through 300.324.
    (f) IEPs for children who transfer from another State. If a child 
with a disability (who had an IEP that was in effect in a previous 
public agency in another State) transfers to a public agency in a new 
State, and enrolls in a new school within the same school year, the new 
public agency (in consultation with the parents) must provide the child 
with FAPE (including services comparable to those described in the 
child's IEP from the previous public agency), until the new public 
agency--
    (1) Conducts an evaluation pursuant to Sec. Sec. 300.304 through 
300.306 (if determined to be necessary by the new public agency); and
    (2) Develops, adopts, and implements a new IEP, if appropriate, that 
meets the applicable requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.320 through 300.324.
    (g) Transmittal of records. To facilitate the transition for a child 
described in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section--
    (1) The new public agency in which the child enrolls must take 
reasonable steps to promptly obtain the child's records, including the 
IEP and supporting documents and any other records relating to the 
provision of special education or related services to the child, from 
the previous public agency in which the child was enrolled, pursuant to 
34 CFR 99.31(a)(2); and
    (2) The previous public agency in which the child was enrolled must 
take reasonable steps to promptly respond to the request from the new 
public agency.

                           Development of IEP


<R05>
Sec. 300.324  Development, review, and revision of IEP.

    (a) Development of IEP--(1) General. In developing each child's IEP, 
the IEP Team must consider--
    (i) The strengths of the child;
    (ii) The concerns of the parents for enhancing the education of 
their child;
    (iii) The results of the initial or most recent evaluation of the 
child; and
    (iv) The academic, developmental, and functional needs of the child.
    (2) Consideration of special factors. The IEP Team must--
    (i) In the case of a child whose behavior impedes the child's 
learning or that of others, consider the use of positive behavioral 
interventions and supports, and other strategies, to address that 
behavior;
    (ii) In the case of a child with limited English proficiency, 
consider the language needs of the child as those needs relate to the 
child's IEP;
    (iii) In the case of a child who is blind or visually impaired, 
provide for instruction in Braille and the use of Braille unless the IEP 
Team determines, after an evaluation of the child's reading and writing 
skills, needs, and appropriate reading and writing media (including an 
evaluation of the child's future needs for instruction in Braille or the 
use of Braille), that instruction in Braille or the use of Braille is 
not appropriate for the child;
    (iv) Consider the communication needs of the child, and in the case 
of a child who is deaf or hard of hearing, consider the child's language 
and communication needs, opportunities for direct communications with 
peers and professional personnel in the child's language and 
communication mode, academic level, and full range of needs, including 
opportunities for direct instruction in the child's language and 
communication mode; and
    (v) Consider whether the child needs assistive technology devices 
and services.
    (3) Requirement with respect to regular education teacher. A regular 
education teacher of a child with a disability, as a member of the IEP 
Team, must, to the extent appropriate, participate in the development of 
the IEP of the child, including the determination of--
    (i) Appropriate positive behavioral interventions and supports and 
other strategies for the child; and
    (ii) Supplementary aids and services, program modifications, and 
support for school personnel consistent with Sec. 300.320(a)(4).
    (4) Agreement. (i) In making changes to a child's IEP after the 
annual IEP Team meeting for a school year, the parent of a child with a 
disability and

[[Page 75]]

the public agency may agree not to convene an IEP Team meeting for the 
purposes of making those changes, and instead may develop a written 
document to amend or modify the child's current IEP.
    (ii) If changes are made to the child's IEP in accordance with 
paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, the public agency must ensure that 
the child's IEP Team is informed of those changes.
    (5) Consolidation of IEP Team meetings. To the extent possible, the 
public agency must encourage the consolidation of reevaluation meetings 
for the child and other IEP Team meetings for the child.
    (6) Amendments. Changes to the IEP may be made either by the entire 
IEP Team at an IEP Team meeting, or as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of 
this section, by amending the IEP rather than by redrafting the entire 
IEP. Upon request, a parent must be provided with a revised copy of the 
IEP with the amendments incorporated.
    (b) Review and revision of IEPs--(1) General. Each public agency 
must ensure that, subject to paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this 
section, the IEP Team--
    (i) Reviews the child's IEP periodically, but not less than 
annually, to determine whether the annual goals for the child are being 
achieved; and
    (ii) Revises the IEP, as appropriate, to address--
    (A) Any lack of expected progress toward the annual goals described 
in Sec. 300.320(a)(2), and in the general education curriculum, if 
appropriate;
    (B) The results of any reevaluation conducted under Sec. 300.303;
    (C) Information about the child provided to, or by, the parents, as 
described under Sec. 300.305(a)(2);
    (D) The child's anticipated needs; or
    (E) Other matters.
    (2) Consideration of special factors. In conducting a review of the 
child's IEP, the IEP Team must consider the special factors described in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (3) Requirement with respect to regular education teacher. A regular 
education teacher of the child, as a member of the IEP Team, must, 
consistent with paragraph (a)(3) of this section, participate in the 
review and revision of the IEP of the child.
    (c) Failure to meet transition objectives--(1) Participating agency 
failure. If a participating agency, other than the public agency, fails 
to provide the transition services described in the IEP in accordance 
with Sec. 300.320(b), the public agency must reconvene the IEP Team to 
identify alternative strategies to meet the transition objectives for 
the child set out in the IEP.
    (2) Construction. Nothing in this part relieves any participating 
agency, including a State vocational rehabilitation agency, of the 
responsibility to provide or pay for any transition service that the 
agency would otherwise provide to children with disabilities who meet 
the eligibility criteria of that agency.
    (d) Children with disabilities in adult prisons--(1) Requirements 
that do not apply. The following requirements do not apply to children 
with disabilities who are convicted as adults under State law and 
incarcerated in adult prisons:
    (i) The requirements contained in section 612(a)(16) of the Act and 
Sec. 300.320(a)(6) (relating to participation of children with 
disabilities in general assessments).
    (ii) The requirements in Sec. 300.320(b) (relating to transition 
planning and transition services) do not apply with respect to the 
children whose eligibility under Part B of the Act will end, because of 
their age, before they will be eligible to be released from prison based 
on consideration of their sentence and eligibility for early release.
    (2) Modifications of IEP or placement. (i) Subject to paragraph 
(d)(2)(ii) of this section, the IEP Team of a child with a disability 
who is convicted as an adult under State law and incarcerated in an 
adult prison may modify the child's IEP or placement if the State has

Sec. 300.325  Private school placements by public agencies.

    (a) Developing IEPs. (1) Before a public agency places a child with 
a disability in, or refers a child to, a private school or facility, the 
agency must initiate and conduct a meeting to develop an IEP for the 
child in accordance with Sec. Sec. 300.320 and 300.324.
    (2) The agency must ensure that a representative of the private 
school or facility attends the meeting. If the representative cannot 
attend, the agency must use other methods to ensure participation by the 
private school or facility, including individual or conference telephone 
calls.
    (b) Reviewing and revising IEPs. (1) After a child with a disability 
enters a private school or facility, any meetings to review and revise 
the child's IEP may be initiated and conducted by the private school or 
facility at the discretion of the public agency.
    (2) If the private school or facility initiates and conducts these 
meetings, the public agency must ensure that the parents and an agency 
representative--
    (i) Are involved in any decision about the child's IEP; and
    (ii) Agree to any proposed changes in the IEP before those changes 
are implemented.
    (c) Responsibility. Even if a private school or facility implements 
a child's IEP, responsibility for compliance with this part remains with 
the public agency and the SEA.

Sec. 300.502  Independent educational evaluation.

    (a) General. (1) The parents of a child with a disability have the 
right under this part to obtain an independent educational evaluation of 
the child, subject to paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section.
    (2) Each public agency must provide to parents, upon request for an 
independent educational evaluation, information about where an 
independent educational evaluation may be obtained, and the agency 
criteria applicable for independent educational evaluations as set forth 
in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (3) For the purposes of this subpart--
    (i) Independent educational evaluation means an evaluation conducted 
by a qualified examiner who is not employed by the public agency 
responsible for the education of the child in question; and
    (ii) Public expense means that the public agency either pays for the 
full cost of the evaluation or ensures that the evaluation is otherwise 
provided at no cost to the parent, consistent with Sec. 300.103.
    (b) Parent right to evaluation at public expense.
    (1) A parent has the right to an independent educational evaluation 
at public expense if the parent disagrees with an evaluation obtained by 
the public agency, subject to the conditions in paragraphs (b)(2) 
through (4) of this section.
    (2) If a parent requests an independent educational evaluation at 
public expense, the public agency must, without unnecessary delay, 
either--
    (i) File a due process complaint to request a hearing to show that 
its evaluation is appropriate; or
    (ii) Ensure that an independent educational evaluation is provided 
at public expense, unless the agency demonstrates in a hearing pursuant 
to Sec. Sec. 300.507 through 300.513 that the evaluation obtained by 
the parent did not meet agency criteria.
    (3) If the public agency files a due process complaint notice to 
request a hearing and the final decision is that the agency's evaluation 
is appropriate, the parent still has the right to an independent 
educational evaluation, but not at public expense.
    (4) If a parent requests an independent educational evaluation, the 
public agency may ask for the parent's reason why he or she objects to 
the public evaluation. However, the public agency may not require the 
parent to provide an explanation and may not unreasonably delay either 
providing the independent educational evaluation at public expense or 
filing a due process complaint to request a due process hearing to 
defend the public evaluation.
    (5) A parent is entitled to only one independent educational 
evaluation at public expense each time the public agency conducts an 
evaluation with which the parent disagrees.

[[Page 78]]

    (c) Parent-initiated evaluations. If the parent obtains an 
independent educational evaluation at public expense or shares with the 
public agency an evaluation obtained at private expense, the results of 
the evaluation--
    (1) Must be considered by the public agency, if it meets agency 
criteria, in any decision made with respect to the provision of FAPE to 
the child; and
    (2) May be presented by any party as evidence at a hearing on a due 
process complaint under subpart E of this part regarding that child.
    (d) Requests for evaluations by hearing officers. If a hearing 
officer requests an independent educational evaluation as part of a 
hearing on a due process complaint, the cost of the evaluation must be 
at public expense.
    (e) Agency criteria. (1) If an independent educational evaluation is 
at public expense, the criteria under which the evaluation is obtained, 
including the location of the evaluation and the qualifications of the 
examiner, must be the same as the criteria that the public agency uses 
when it initiates an evaluation, to the extent those criteria are 
consistent with the parent's right to an independent educational 
evaluation.
    (2) Except for the criteria described in paragraph (e)(1) of this 
section, a public agency may not impose conditions or timelines related 
to obtaining an independent educational evaluation at public expense.

    (a) Resolution meeting. (1) Within 15 days of receiving notice of 
the parent's due process complaint, and prior to the initiation of a due 
process hearing under Sec. 300.511, the LEA must convene a meeting with 
the parent and the relevant member or members of the IEP Team who have 
specific knowledge of the facts identified in the due process complaint 
that--
    (i) Includes a representative of the public agency who has decision-
making authority on behalf of that agency; and
    (ii) May not include an attorney of the LEA unless the parent is 
accompanied by an attorney.
    (2) The purpose of the meeting is for the parent of the child to 
discuss the due process complaint, and the facts that form the basis of 
the due process complaint, so that the LEA has the opportunity to 
resolve the dispute that is the basis for the due process complaint.
    (3) The meeting described in paragraph (a)(1) and (2) of this 
section need not be held if--
    (i) The parent and the LEA agree in writing to waive the meeting; or
    (ii) The parent and the LEA agree to use the mediation process 
described in Sec. 300.506.

process complaint to the satisfaction of the parent within 30 days of 
the receipt of the due process complaint, the due process hearing may 
occur.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the 
timeline for issuing a final decision under Sec. 300.515 begins at the 
expiration of this 30-day period.
    (3) Except where the parties have jointly agreed to waive the 
resolution process or to use mediation, notwithstanding paragraphs 
(b)(1) and (2) of this section, the failure of the parent filing a due 
process complaint to participate in the resolution meeting will delay 
the timelines for the resolution process and due process hearing until 
the meeting is held.
    (4) If the LEA is unable to obtain the participation of the parent 
in the resolution meeting after reasonable efforts have been made (and 
documented using the procedures in Sec. 300.322(d)), the LEA may, at 
the conclusion of the 30-day period, request that a hearing officer 
dismiss the parent's due process complaint.
    (5) If the LEA fails to hold the resolution meeting specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section within 15 days of receiving notice of a 
parent's due process complaint or fails to participate in the resolution

    (c) Impartial hearing officer. (1) At a minimum, a hearing officer--
    (i) Must not be--
    (A) An employee of the SEA or the LEA that is involved in the

    (3) Each public agency must keep a list of the persons who serve as 
hearing officers. The list must include a statement of the 
qualifications of each of those persons.
    (d) Subject matter of due process hearings. The party requesting the 
due process hearing may not raise issues at the due process hearing that 
were not raised in the due process complaint filed under Sec.

process hearing under this part, in the time allowed by that State law.
    (f) Exceptions to the timeline. The timeline described in paragraph 
(e) of this section does not apply to a parent if the parent was 
prevented from filing a due process complaint due to--
    (1) Specific misrepresentations by the LEA that it had resolved the 
problem forming the basis of the due process complaint; or
    (2) The LEA's withholding of information from the parent that was 
required under this part to be provided to the parent.

reasonable attorneys' fees as part of the costs to--
    (i) The prevailing party who is the parent of a child with a 
disability;
    (ii) To a prevailing party who is an SEA or LEA against the attorney 
of a parent who files a complaint or subsequent cause of action that is 
frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation, or against the attorney 
of a parent who continued to litigate after the litigation clearly 
became frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation; or
    (iii) To a prevailing SEA or LEA against the attorney of a parent, 
or against the parent, if the parent's request for a due process hearing 
or subsequent cause of action was presented for any improper purpose, 
such as to harass, to cause unnecessary delay, or to needlessly increase 
the cost of litigation.
    (2) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to affect section 
327 of the District of Columbia Appropriations Act, 2005.
    (b) Prohibition on use of funds. (1) Funds under Part B of the Act 
may not be used to pay attorneys' fees or costs of a party related to 
any action or proceeding under section 615 of the Act and subpart E of 
this part.
    (2) Paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not preclude a public 
agency from using funds under Part B of the Act for conducting an action 
or proceeding under section 615 of the Act.
    (c) Award of fees. A court awards reasonable attorneys' fees under 
section 615(i)(3) of the Act consistent with the following:
    (1) Fees awarded under section 615(i)(3) of the Act must be based on 
rates prevailing in the community in which the action or proceeding 
arose for the kind and quality of services furnished. No bonus or 
multiplier may be used in calculating the fees awarded under this 
paragraph.
    (2)(i) Attorneys' fees may not be awarded and related costs may not 
be reimbursed in any action or proceeding under section 615 of the Act 
for services performed subsequent to the time of a written offer of 
settlement to a parent if--
    (A) The offer is made within the time prescribed by Rule 68 of the 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or, in the case of an administrative 
proceeding, at any time more than 10 days before the proceeding begins;
    (B) The offer is not accepted within 10 days; and
    (C) The court or administrative hearing officer finds that the 
relief finally obtained by the parents is not more favorable to the 
parents than the offer of settlement.
    (ii) Attorneys' fees may not be awarded relating to any meeting of 
the IEP Team unless the meeting is convened as a result of an 
administrative proceeding or judicial action, or at the discretion of 
the State, for a mediation described in Sec. 300.506.
    (iii) A meeting conducted pursuant to Sec. 300.510 shall not be 
considered--
    (A) A meeting convened as a result of an administrative hearing or 
judicial action; or
    (B) An administrative hearing or judicial action for purposes of 
this section.
    (3) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(2) of this section, an award of 
attorneys' fees and related costs may be made to a parent who is the 
prevailing party and who was substantially justified in rejecting the 
settlement offer.
    (4) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, the 
court reduces, accordingly, the amount of the attorneys' fees awarded 
under section 615 of the Act, if the court finds that--
    (i) The parent, or the parent's attorney, during the course of the 
action or proceeding, unreasonably protracted the final resolution of 
the controversy;
    (ii) The amount of the attorneys' fees otherwise authorized to be 
awarded unreasonably exceeds the hourly rate prevailing in the community 
for similar services by attorneys of reasonably comparable skill, 
reputation, and experience;

[[Page 87]]

    (iii) The time spent and legal services furnished were excessive 
considering the nature of the action or proceeding; or
    (iv) The attorney representing the parent did not provide to the LEA 
the appropriate information in the due process request notice in 
accordance with Sec. 300.508.
    (5) The provisions of paragraph (c)(4) of this section do not apply 
in any action or proceeding if the court finds that the State or local 
agency unreasonably protracted the final resolution of the action or 
proceeding or there was a violation of section 615 of the Act.

    (a) Except as provided in Sec. 300.533, during the pendency of any 
administrative or judicial proceeding regarding a due process complaint 
notice requesting a due process hearing under Sec. 300.507, unless the 
State or local agency and the parents of the child agree otherwise, the 
child involved in the complaint must remain in his or her current 
educational placement.
    (b) If the complaint involves an application for initial admission 
to public school, the child, with the consent of the parents, must be 
placed in the public school until the completion of all the proceedings.
    (c) If the complaint involves an application for initial services 
under this part from a child who is transitioning from Part C of the Act 
to Part B and is no longer eligible for Part C services because the 
child has turned three, the public agency is not required to provide the 
Part C services that the child had been receiving. If the child is found 
eligible for special education and related services under Part B and the 
parent consents to the initial provision of special education and 
related services under Sec. 300.300(b), then the public agency must 
provide those special education and related services that are not in 
dispute between the parent and the public agency.
    (d) If the hearing officer in a due process hearing conducted by the 
SEA or a State review official in an administrative appeal agrees with 
the child's parents that a change of placement is appropriate, that 
placement must be treated as an agreement between the State and the 
parents for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section.

child are protected when--
    (1) No parent (as defined in Sec. 300.30) can be identified;
    (2) The public agency, after reasonable efforts, cannot locate a 
parent;
    (3) The child is a ward of the State under the laws of that State; 
or
    (4) The child is an unaccompanied homeless youth as defined in 
section 725(6) of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 
11434a(6)).
    (b) Duties of public agency. The duties of a public agency under 
paragraph (a) of this section include the assignment of an individual to 
act as a surrogate for the parents. This must include a method--
    (1) For determining whether a child needs a surrogate parent; and
    (2) For assigning a surrogate parent to the child.
    (c) Wards of the State. In the case of a child who is a ward of the 
State, the surrogate parent alternatively may be appointed by the judge 
overseeing the child's case, provided that the surrogate meets the 
requirements in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (e) of this section.
    (d) Criteria for selection of surrogate parents. (1) The public 
agency may select a surrogate parent in any way permitted under State 
law.

the interest of the child the surrogate parent represents; and
    (iii) Has knowledge and skills that ensure adequate representation 
of the child.
    (e) Non-employee requirement; compensation. A person otherwise 
qualified

[[Page 88]]

to be a surrogate parent under paragraph (d) of this section is not an 
employee of the agency solely because he or she is paid by the agency to 
serve as a surrogate parent.
    (f) Unaccompanied homeless youth. In the case of a child who is an 
unaccompanied homeless youth, appropriate staff of emergency shelters, 
transitional shelters, independent living programs, and street outreach 
programs may be appointed as temporary surrogate parents without regard 
to paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, until a surrogate parent can be 
appointed that meets all of the requirements of paragraph (d) of this 
section.
    (g) Surrogate parent responsibilities. The surrogate parent may 
represent the child in all matters relating to--
    (1) The identification, evaluation, and educational placement of the 
child; and
    (2) The provision of FAPE to the child.
    (h) SEA responsibility. The SEA must make reasonable efforts to 
ensure the assignment of a surrogate parent not more than 30 days after 
a public agency determines that the child needs a surrogate parent.

all children (except for a child with a disability who has been 
determined to be incompetent under State law)--
    (1)(i) The public agency must provide any notice required by this

must notify the child and the parents of the transfer of rights.
    (b) Special rule. A State must establish procedures for appointing 
the parent of a child with a disability, or, if the parent is not 
available, another appropriate individual, to represent the educational 
interests of the child throughout the period of the child's eligibility 
under Part B of the Act if, under State law, a child who has reached the 
age of majority, but has not been determined to be incompetent, can be 
determined not to have the ability to provide informed consent with 
respect to the child's educational program.

<R05>
Sec. 300.530  Authority of school personnel.

    (a) Case-by-case determination. School personnel may consider any 
unique circumstances on a case-by-case basis when determining whether a 
change in placement, consistent with the other requirements of this 
section, is appropriate for a child with a disability who violates a 
code of student conduct.
    (b) General. (1) School personnel under this section may remove a 
child with a disability who violates a code of student conduct from his 
or her current placement to an appropriate interim alternative 
educational setting, another setting, or suspension, for not more than 
10 consecutive school days (to the extent those alternatives are applied 
to children without disabilities), and for additional removals of not 
more than 10 consecutive school days in that same school year for 
separate incidents of misconduct (as long as those removals do not 
constitute a change of placement under Sec. 300.536).
    (2) After a child with a disability has been removed from his or her 
current placement for 10 school days in the same school year, during any 
subsequent days of removal the public agency must provide services to 
the extent required under paragraph (d) of this section.
    (c) Additional authority. For disciplinary changes in placement that 
would exceed 10 consecutive school days, if

[[Page 89]]

the behavior that gave rise to the violation of the school code is 
determined not to be a manifestation of the child's disability pursuant 
to paragraph (e) of this section, school personnel may apply the 
relevant disciplinary procedures to children with disabilities in the 
same manner and for the same duration as the procedures would be applied 
to children without disabilities, except as provided in paragraph (d) of 
this section.
    (d) Services. (1) A child with a disability who is removed from the 
child's current placement pursuant to paragraphs (c), or (g) of this 
section must--
    (i) Continue to receive educational services, as provided in Sec. 
300.101(a), so as to enable the child to continue to participate in the 
general education curriculum, although in another setting, and to 
progress toward meeting the goals set out in the child's IEP; and
    (ii) Receive, as appropriate, a functional behavioral assessment, 
and behavioral intervention services and modifications, that are 
designed to address the behavior violation so that it does not recur.
    (2) The services required by paragraph (d)(1), (d)(3), (d)(4), and 
(d)(5) of this section may be provided in an interim alternative 
educational setting.
    (3) A public agency is only required to provide services during 
periods of removal to a child with a disability who has been removed 
from his or her current placement for 10 school days or less in that 
school year, if it provides services to a child without disabilities who 
is similarly removed.
    (4) After a child with a disability has been removed from his or her 
current placement for 10 school days in the same school year, if the 
current removal is for not more than 10 consecutive school days and is 
not a change of placement under Sec. 300.536, school personnel, in 
consultation with at least one of the child's teachers, determine the 
extent to which services are needed, as provided in Sec. 300.101(a), so 
as to enable the child to continue to participate in the general 
education curriculum, although in another setting, and to progress 
toward meeting the goals set out in the child's IEP.
    (5) If the removal is a change of placement under Sec. 300.536, the 
child's IEP Team determines appropriate services under paragraph (d)(1) 
of this section.
    (e) Manifestation determination. (1) Within 10 school days of any 
decision to change the placement of a child with a disability because of 
a violation of a code of student conduct, the LEA, the parent, and 
relevant members of the child's IEP Team (as determined by the parent 
and the LEA) must review all relevant information in the student's file, 
including the child's IEP, any teacher observations, and any relevant 
information provided by the parents to determine--
    (i) If the conduct in question was caused by, or had a direct and 
substantial relationship to, the child's disability; or
    (ii) If the conduct in question was the direct result of the LEA's 
failure to implement the IEP.
    (2) The conduct must be determined to be a manifestation of the 
child's disability if the LEA, the parent, and relevant members of the 
child's IEP Team determine that a condition in either paragraph 
(e)(1)(i) or (1)(ii) of this section was met.
    (3) If the LEA, the parent, and relevant members of the child's IEP 
Team determine the condition described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this 
section was met, the LEA must take immediate steps to remedy those 
deficiencies.
    (f) Determination that behavior was a manifestation. If the LEA, the 
parent, and relevant members of the IEP Team make the determination that 
the conduct was a manifestation of the child's disability, the IEP Team 
must--
    (1) Either--
    (i) Conduct a functional behavioral assessment, unless the LEA had 
conducted a functional behavioral assessment before the behavior that 
resulted in the change of placement occurred, and implement a behavioral 
intervention plan for the child; or
    (ii) If a behavioral intervention plan already has been developed, 
review the behavioral intervention plan, and modify it, as necessary, to 
address the behavior; and
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, return the 
child to the placement from which the child was removed, unless the 
parent and the

[[Page 90]]

LEA agree to a change of placement as part of the modification of the 
behavioral intervention plan.
    (g) Special circumstances. School personnel may remove a student to 
an interim alternative educational setting for not more than 45 school 
days without regard to whether the behavior is determined to be a 
manifestation of the child's disability, if the child--
    (1) Carries a weapon to or possesses a weapon at school, on school 
premises, or to or at a school function under the jurisdiction of an SEA 
or an LEA;
    (2) Knowingly possesses or uses illegal drugs, or sells or solicits 
the sale of a controlled substance, while at school, on school premises, 
or at a school function under the jurisdiction of an SEA or an LEA; or
    (3) Has inflicted serious bodily injury upon another person while at 
school, on school premises, or at a school function under the 
jurisdiction of an SEA or an LEA.
    (h) Notification. On the date on which the decision is made to make 
a removal that constitutes a change of placement of a child with a 
disability because of a violation of a code of student conduct, the LEA 
must notify the parents of that decision, and provide the parents the 
procedural safeguards notice described in Sec. 300.504.
    (i) Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following 
definitions apply:
    (1) Controlled substance means a drug or other substance identified 
under schedules I, II, III, IV, or V in section 202(c) of the Controlled

Sec. 300.532  Appeal.

    (a) General. The parent of a child with a disability who disagrees 
with any decision regarding placement under Sec. Sec. 300.530 and 
300.531, or the manifestation determination under Sec. 300.530(e), or 
an LEA that believes that maintaining the current placement of the child 
is substantially likely to result in injury to the child or others, may 
appeal the decision by requesting a hearing. The hearing is requested by 
filing a complaint pursuant to Sec. Sec. 300.507 and 300.508(a) and 
(b).
    (b) Authority of hearing officer. (1) A hearing officer under Sec. 
300.511 hears, and makes a determination regarding an appeal under 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (2) In making the determination under paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section, the hearing officer may--
    (i) Return the child with a disability to the placement from which 
the child was removed if the hearing officer determines that the removal 
was a violation of Sec. 300.530 or that the child's behavior was a 
manifestation of the child's disability; or
    (ii) Order a change of placement of the child with a disability to 
an appropriate interim alternative educational setting for not more than 
45 school days if the hearing officer determines that maintaining the 
current placement of the child is substantially likely to result in 
injury to the child or to others.
    (3) The procedures under paragraphs (a) and (b)(1) and (2) of this 
section may be repeated, if the LEA believes that returning the child to 
the original placement is substantially likely to result in injury to 
the child or to others.
    (c) Expedited due process hearing. (1) Whenever a hearing is 
requested under

[[Page 91]]

paragraph (a) of this section, the parents or the LEA involved in the

in paragraph (c)(2) through (4) of this section.
    (2) The SEA or LEA is responsible for arranging the expedited due 
process hearing, which must occur within 20 school days of the date the 
complaint requesting the hearing is filed. The hearing officer must make 
a determination within 10 school days after the hearing.
    (3) Unless the parents and LEA agree in writing to waive the 
resolution meeting described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, or 
agree to use the mediation process described in Sec. 300.506--
    (i) A resolution meeting must occur within seven days of receiving 
notice of the due process complaint; and
    (ii) The due process hearing may proceed unless the matter has been 
resolved to the satisfaction of both parties within 15 days of the 
receipt of the due process complaint.
    (4) A State may establish different State-imposed procedural rules 
for expedited due process hearings conducted under this section than it 
has established for other due process hearings, but, except for the 
timelines as modified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the State 
must ensure that the requirements in Sec. Sec. 300.510 through 300.514 
are met.
    (5) The decisions on expedited due process hearings are appealable 
consistent with Sec. 300.514.

<R05>
Sec. 300.534  Protections for children not determined eligible for special
education and related services.

    (a) General. A child who has not been determined to be eligible for 
special education and related services under this part and who has 
engaged in behavior that violated a code of student conduct, may assert 
any of the protections provided for in this part if the public agency 
had knowledge (as determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this 
section) that the child was a child with a disability before the 
behavior that precipitated the disciplinary action occurred.
    (b) Basis of knowledge. A public agency must be deemed to have 
knowledge that a child is a child with a disability if before the 
behavior that precipitated the disciplinary action occurred--
    (1) The parent of the child expressed concern in writing to 
supervisory or administrative personnel of the appropriate educational 
agency, or a teacher of the child, that the child is in need of special 
education and related services;
    (2) The parent of the child requested an evaluation of the child 
pursuant to Sec. Sec. 300.300 through 300.311; or
    (3) The teacher of the child, or other personnel of the LEA, 
expressed specific concerns about a pattern of behavior demonstrated by 
the child directly to the director of special education of the agency or 
to other supervisory personnel of the agency.
    (c) Exception. A public agency would not be deemed to have knowledge 
under paragraph (b) of this section if--
    (1) The parent of the child--
    (i) Has not allowed an evaluation of the child pursuant to 
Sec. Sec. 300.300 through 300.311; or
    (ii) Has refused services under this part; or
    (2) The child has been evaluated in accordance with Sec. Sec. 
300.300 through 300.311 and determined to not be a child with a 
disability under this part.
    (d) Conditions that apply if no basis of knowledge. (1) If a public 
agency does not have knowledge that a child is a

[[Page 92]]

child with a disability (in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of 
this section) prior to taking disciplinary measures against the child, 
the child may be subjected to the disciplinary measures applied to 
children without disabilities who engage in comparable behaviors 
consistent with paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
    (2)(i) If a request is made for an evaluation of a child during the 
time period in which the child is subjected to disciplinary measures 
under Sec. 300.530, the evaluation must be conducted in an expedited 
manner.
    (ii) Until the evaluation is completed, the child remains in the 
educational placement determined by school authorities, which can 
include suspension or expulsion without educational services.
    (iii) If the child is determined to be a child with a disability, 
taking into consideration information from the evaluation conducted by 
the agency and information provided by the parents, the agency must 
provide special education and related services in accordance with this 
part, including the requirements of Sec. Sec. 300.530 through 300.536 
and section 612(a)(1)(A) of the Act.

<R05>
Sec. 300.535  Referral to and action by law enforcement and judicial authorities.

    (a) Rule of construction. Nothing in this part prohibits an agency 
from reporting a crime committed by a child with a disability to 
appropriate authorities or prevents State law enforcement and judicial 
authorities from exercising their responsibilities with regard to the 
application of Federal and State law to crimes committed by a child with 
a disability.
    (b) Transmittal of records. (1) An agency reporting a crime 
committed by a child with a disability must ensure that copies of the 
special education and disciplinary records of the child are transmitted 
for consideration by the appropriate authorities to whom the agency 
reports the crime.
    (2) An agency reporting a crime under this section may transmit 
copies of the child's special education and disciplinary records only to 
the extent that the transmission is permitted by the Family Educational 
Rights and Privacy Act.

Sec. 300.536  Change of placement because of disciplinary removals.

    (a) For purposes of removals of a child with a disability from the 
child's current educational placement under Sec. Sec. 300.530 through 
300.535, a change of placement occurs if--
    (1) The removal is for more than 10 consecutive school days; or
    (2) The child has been subjected to a series of removals that 
constitute a pattern--
    (i) Because the series of removals total more than 10 school days in 
a school year;
    (ii) Because the child's behavior is substantially similar to the 
child's behavior in previous incidents that resulted in the series of 
removals; and
    (iii) Because of such additional factors as the length of each 
removal, the total amount of time the child has been removed, and the 
proximity of the removals to one another.
    (b)(1) The public agency determines on a case-by-case basis whether 
a pattern of removals constitutes a change of placement.
    (2) This determination is subject to review through due process and 
judicial proceedings.

Sec. 300.537  State enforcement mechanisms.

    Notwithstanding Sec. Sec. 300.506(b)(7) and 300.510(d)(2), which 
provide for judicial enforcement of a written agreement reached as a 
result of mediation or a resolution meeting, there is nothing in this 
part that would prevent the SEA from using other mechanisms to seek 
enforcement of that agreement, provided that use of those mechanisms is 
not mandatory and does not delay or deny a party the right to seek 
enforcement of the written agreement in a State court of competent 
jurisdiction or in a district court of the United States.

requirements that are most closely related to improving educational 
results for children with disabilities.
    (c) As a part of its responsibilities under paragraph (a) of this 
section, the State must use quantifiable indicators and such qualitative 
indicators as are needed to adequately measure performance in the 
priority areas identified in paragraph (d) of this section, and the 
indicators established by the Secretary for the State performance plans.
    (d) The State must monitor the LEAs located in the State, using 
quantifiable indicators in each of the following priority areas, and 
using such qualitative indicators as are needed to adequately measure 
performance in those areas:
    (1) Provision of FAPE in the least restrictive environment.
    (2) State exercise of general supervision, including child find, 
effective monitoring, the use of resolution meetings, mediation, and a 
system of transition services as defined in Sec. 300.43 and in 20 
U.S.C. 1437(a)(9).
    (3) Disproportionate representation of racial and ethnic groups in 
special education and related services, to the extent the representation 
is the result of inappropriate identification.
    (e) In exercising its monitoring responsibilities under paragraph 
(d) of this section, the State must ensure that when it identifies 
noncompliance with the requirements of this part by LEAs, the 
noncompliance is corrected as soon as possible, and in no case later

    (i) That the withholding will be limited to programs or projects, or 
portions of programs or projects, that affected the Secretary's 
determination under Sec. 300.603(b)(1); or
    (ii) That the SEA must not make further payments under Part B of the 
Act to specified State agencies or LEAs that caused or were involved in 
the Secretary's determination under Sec. 300.603(b)(1).
    (2) Until the Secretary is satisfied that the condition that caused 
the initial withholding has been substantially rectified--
    (i) Payments to the State under Part B of the Act must be withheld 
in whole or in part; and
    (ii) Payments by the SEA under Part B of the Act must be limited to

Act, except that--
    (a) Any reduction or withholding of payments to the State under 
Sec. 300.604 must be proportionate to the total funds allotted under

with disabilities in adult prisons under the supervision of the other 
public agency is proportionate to the number of eligible individuals 
with disabilities in the State under the supervision of the SEA; and

of the Interior.

    (a) Outlying areas and freely associated States--(1) Funds reserved. 
From the amount appropriated for any fiscal year under section 611(i) of 
the Act, the Secretary reserves not more than one percent, which must be 
used--
    (i) To provide assistance to the outlying areas in accordance with 
their respective populations of individuals aged 3 through 21; and
    (ii) To provide each freely associated State a grant in the amount 
that the freely associated State received for fiscal year 2003 under 
Part B of the Act, but only if the freely associated State--
    (A) Meets the applicable requirements of Part B of the Act that 
apply to States.
    (B) Meets the requirements in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (2) Application. Any freely associated State that wishes to receive

assistance--

[[Page 103]]

    (i) Information demonstrating that it will meet all conditions that 
apply to States under Part B of the Act.
    (ii) An assurance that, notwithstanding any other provision of Part 
B of the Act, it will use those funds only for the direct provision of 
special education and related services to children with disabilities and 
to enhance its capacity to make FAPE available to all children with 
disabilities;
    (iii) The identity of the source and amount of funds, in addition to 
funds under Part B of the Act, that it will make available to ensure 
that FAPE is available to all children with disabilities within its 
jurisdiction; and
    (iv) Such other information and assurances as the Secretary may 
require.
    (3) Special rule. The provisions of Public Law 95-134, permitting 
the consolidation of grants by the outlying areas, do not apply to funds

Part B of the Act.
    (b) Secretary of the Interior. From the amount appropriated for any 
fiscal year under section 611(i) of the Act, the Secretary reserves

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1411(b))


<R05>
Sec. 300.702  Technical assistance.

    (a) In general. The Secretary may reserve not more than one-half of 
one percent of the amounts appropriated under Part B of the Act for each 
fiscal year to support technical assistance activities authorized under 
section 616(i) of the Act.
    (b) Maximum amount. The maximum amount the Secretary may reserve 
under paragraph (a) of this section for any fiscal year is $25,000,000, 
cumulatively adjusted by the rate of inflation as measured by the 
percentage increase, if any, from the preceding fiscal year in the 
Consumer Price Index For All Urban Consumers, published by the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1411(c))


<R05>
Sec. 300.703  Allocations to States.

    (a) General. After reserving funds for technical assistance under 
Sec. 300.702, and for payments to the outlying areas, the freely 
associated States, and the Secretary of the Interior under Sec. 300.701 
(a) and (b) for a fiscal year, the Secretary allocates the remaining 
amount among the States in accordance with paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) 
of this section.
    (b) Special rule for use of fiscal year 1999 amount. If a State 
received any funds under section 611 of the Act for fiscal year 1999 on 
the basis of children aged three through five, but does not make FAPE 
available to all children with disabilities aged three through five in 
the State in any subsequent fiscal year, the Secretary computes the 
State's amount for fiscal year 1999, solely for the purpose of 
calculating the State's allocation in that subsequent year under 
paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, by subtracting the amount 
allocated to the State for fiscal year 1999 on the basis of those 
children.
    (c) Increase in funds. If the amount available for allocations to 
States under paragraph (a) of this section for a fiscal year is equal to 
or greater than the amount allocated to the States under section 611 of 
the Act for the preceding fiscal year, those allocations are calculated 
as follows:
    (1) Allocation of increase.--(i) General. Except as provided in 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the Secretary allocates for the fiscal 
year--
    (A) To each State the amount the State received under this section 
for fiscal year 1999;
    (B) Eighty-five (85) percent of any remaining funds to States on the 
basis of the States' relative populations of children aged 3 through 21 
who are of the same age as children with disabilities for whom the State 
ensures the availability of FAPE under Part B of the Act; and
    (C) Fifteen (15) percent of those remaining funds to States on the 
basis of the States' relative populations of children described in 
paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B) of this section who are living in poverty.
    (ii) Data. For the purpose of making grants under this section, the 
Secretary uses the most recent population data, including data on 
children living in poverty, that are available and satisfactory to the 
Secretary.

[[Page 104]]

    (2) Limitations. Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, 
allocations under this section are subject to the following:
    (i) Preceding year allocation. No State's allocation may be less 
than its allocation under section 611 of the Act for the preceding 
fiscal year.
    (ii) Minimum. No State's allocation may be less than the greatest 
of--
    (A) The sum of--
    (1) The amount the State received under section 611 of the Act for 
fiscal year 1999; and
    (2) One third of one percent of the amount by which the amount 
appropriated under section 611(i) of the Act for the fiscal year exceeds 
the amount appropriated for section 611 of the Act for fiscal year 1999;
    (B) The sum of--
    (1) The amount the State received under section 611 of the Act for 
the preceding fiscal year; and
    (2) That amount multiplied by the percentage by which the increase 
in the funds appropriated for section 611 of the Act from the preceding 
fiscal year exceeds 1.5 percent; or
    (C) The sum of--
    (1) The amount the State received under section 611 of the Act for 
the preceding fiscal year; and
    (2) That amount multiplied by 90 percent of the percentage increase 
in the amount appropriated for section 611 of the Act from the preceding 
fiscal year.
    (iii) Maximum. Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, 
no State's allocation under paragraph (a) of this section may exceed the 
sum of--
    (A) The amount the State received under section 611 of the Act for 
the preceding fiscal year; and
    (B) That amount multiplied by the sum of 1.5 percent and the 
percentage increase in the amount appropriated under section 611 of the 
Act from the preceding fiscal year.
    (3) Ratable reduction. If the amount available for allocations to 
States under paragraph (c) of this section is insufficient to pay those 
allocations in full, those allocations are ratably reduced, subject to 
paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.
    (d) Decrease in funds. If the amount available for allocations to 
States under paragraph (a) of this section for a fiscal year is less 
than the amount allocated to the States under section 611 of the Act for 
the preceding fiscal year, those allocations are calculated as follows:
    (1) Amounts greater than fiscal year 1999 allocations. If the amount 
available for allocations under paragraph (a) of this section is greater 
than the amount allocated to the States for fiscal year 1999, each State 
is allocated the sum of--
    (i) 1999 amount. The amount the State received under section 611 of 
the Act for fiscal year 1999; and
    (ii) Remaining funds. An amount that bears the same relation to any 
remaining funds as the increase the State received under section 611 of 
the Act for the preceding fiscal year over fiscal year 1999 bears to the 
total of all such increases for all States.
    (2) Amounts equal to or less than fiscal year 1999 allocations.--(i) 
General. If the amount available for allocations under paragraph (a) of 
this section is equal to or less than the amount allocated to the States 
for fiscal year 1999, each State is allocated the amount it received for 
fiscal year 1999.
    (ii) Ratable reduction. If the amount available for allocations 
under paragraph (d) of this section is insufficient to make the 
allocations described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, those 
allocations are ratably reduced.

section--
    (A) To finance and make disbursements from the high cost fund to

    (A) Establish, in consultation and coordination with representatives 
from LEAs, a definition of a high need child with a disability that, at 
a minimum--
    (1) Addresses the financial impact a high need child with a 
disability has on the budget of the child's LEA; and
    (2) Ensures that the cost of the high need child with a disability 
is greater than 3 times the average per pupil expenditure (as defined in 
section 9101 of the ESEA) in that State;
    (B) Establish eligibility criteria for the participation of an LEA 
that, at a minimum, take into account the number and percentage of high 
need children with disabilities served by an LEA;
    (C) Establish criteria to ensure that placements supported by the

    (F) If the State elects to reserve funds for supporting innovative 
and effective ways of cost sharing under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B) of this 
section, describe how these funds will be used.
    (ii) The State must make its final State plan available to the 
public not less than 30 days before the beginning of the school year,

child's IEP.
    (iii) The funds in the high cost fund remain under the control of 
the State until disbursed to an LEA to support a specific child who 
qualifies under the State plan for the high cost funds or distributed to 
LEAs, consistent with paragraph (c)(9) of this section.
    (5) The disbursements under paragraph (c)(4) of this section must 
not be used to support legal fees, court costs, or other costs 
associated with a cause of action brought on behalf of a child with a 
disability to ensure FAPE for such child.
    (6) Nothing in paragraph (c) of this section--
    (i) Limits or conditions the right of a child with a disability who 
is assisted under Part B of the Act to receive FAPE pursuant to section 
612(a)(1) of the Act in the least restrictive environment pursuant to 
section 612(a)(5) of the Act; or
    (ii) Authorizes an SEA or LEA to establish a limit on what may be 
spent on the education of a child with a disability.
    (7) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (c)(1) through (6) 
of this section, a State may use funds reserved pursuant to paragraph 
(c)(1)(i) of this section for implementing a placement neutral cost 
sharing and reimbursement program of high need, low incidence, 
catastrophic, or extraordinary aid to LEAs that provides services to 
high need children based on eligibility criteria for such programs that 
were created not later than January 1, 2004, and are currently in

the definition of a high need child with a disability as described in 
paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) of this section.

[[Page 108]]

    (9) Funds reserved under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section from 
the appropriation for any fiscal year, but not expended pursuant to 
paragraph (c)(4) of this section before the beginning of their last year 
of availability for obligation, must be allocated to LEAs in the same 
manner as other funds from the appropriation for that fiscal year are 
allocated to LEAs under Sec. 300.705 during their final year of 
availability.
    (d) Inapplicability of certain prohibitions. A State may use funds 
the State reserves under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section without 
regard to--
    (1) The prohibition on commingling of funds in Sec. 300.162(b).
    (2) The prohibition on supplanting other funds in Sec. 300.162(c).
    (e) Special rule for increasing funds. A State may use funds the 
State reserves under paragraph (a)(1) of this section as a result of 
inflationary increases under paragraph (a)(2) of this section to carry 
out activities authorized under paragraph(b)(4)(i), (iii), (vii), or 
(viii) of this section.
    (f) Flexibility in using funds for Part C. Any State eligible to 
receive a grant under section 619 of the Act may use funds made 
available under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, Sec. 300.705(c), or 
Sec. 300.814(e) to develop and implement a State policy jointly with 
the lead agency under Part C of the Act and the SEA to provide early 
intervention services (which must include an educational component that 
promotes school readiness and incorporates preliteracy, language, and 
numeracy skills) in accordance with Part C of the Act to children with 
disabilities who are eligible for services under section 619 of the Act 
and who previously received services under Part C of the Act until the 
children enter, or are eligible under State law to enter, kindergarten, 
or elementary school as appropriate.

<R05>
Sec. 300.705  Subgrants to LEAs.

    (a) Subgrants required. Each State that receives a grant under 
section 611 of the Act for any fiscal year must distribute any funds the 
State does not reserve under Sec. 300.704 to LEAs (including public 
charter schools that operate as LEAs) in the State that have established 
their eligibility under section 613 of the Act for use in accordance 
with Part B of the Act. Effective with funds that become available on 
the July 1, 2009, each State must distribute funds to eligible LEAs, 
including public charter schools that operate as LEAs, even if the LEA 
is not serving any children with disabilities.
    (b) Allocations to LEAs. For each fiscal year for which funds are 
allocated to States under Sec. 300.703, each State shall allocate funds 
as follows:
    (1) Base payments. The State first must award each LEA described in 
paragraph (a) of this section the amount the LEA would have received 
under section 611 of the Act for fiscal year 1999, if the State had 
distributed 75 percent of its grant for that year under section 611(d) 
of the Act, as that section was then in effect.
    (2) Base payment adjustments. For any fiscal year after 1999--
    (i) If a new LEA is created, the State must divide the base 
allocation determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section for the 
LEAs that would have been responsible for serving children with 
disabilities now being served by the new LEA, among the new LEA and 
affected LEAs based on the relative numbers of children with 
disabilities ages 3 through 21, or ages 6 through 21 if a State has had 
its payment reduced under Sec. 300.703(b), currently provided special 
education by each of the LEAs;
    (ii) If one or more LEAs are combined into a single new LEA, the 
State must combine the base allocations of the merged LEAs;
    (iii) If, for two or more LEAs, geographic boundaries or 
administrative responsibility for providing services to children with 
disabilities ages 3 through 21 change, the base allocations of affected 
LEAs must be redistributed among affected LEAs based on the relative 
numbers of children with disabilities ages 3 through 21, or ages 6 
through 21 if a State has had its payment reduced under Sec. 
300.703(b), currently provided special education by each affected LEA; 
and

[[Page 109]]

    (iv) If an LEA received a base payment of zero in its first year of 
operation, the SEA must adjust the base payment for the first fiscal 
year after the first annual child count in which the LEA reports that it 
is serving any children with disabilities. The State must divide the 
base allocation determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section for 
the LEAs that would have been responsible for serving children with 
disabilities now being served by the LEA, among the LEA and affected 
LEAs based on the relative numbers of children with disabilities ages 3 
through 21, or ages 6 through 21 currently provided special education by 
each of the LEAs. This requirement takes effect with funds that become 
available on July 1, 2009.
    (3) Allocation of remaining funds. After making allocations under 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, as adjusted by paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section, the State must--
    (i) Allocate 85 percent of any remaining funds to those LEAs on the 
basis of the relative numbers of children enrolled in public and private 
elementary schools and secondary schools within the LEA's jurisdiction; 
and
    (ii) Allocate 15 percent of those remaining funds to those LEAs in 
accordance with their relative numbers of children living in poverty, as 
determined by the SEA.
    (c) Reallocation of LEA funds. (1) If an SEA determines that an LEA 
is adequately providing FAPE to all children with disabilities residing 
in the area served by that agency with State and local funds, the SEA 
may reallocate any portion of the funds under this part that are not 
needed by that LEA to provide FAPE, to other LEAs in the State that are 
not adequately providing special education and related services to all 
children with disabilities residing in the areas served by those other 
LEAs. The SEA may also retain those funds for use at the State level to 
the extent the State has not reserved the maximum amount of funds it is 
permitted to reserve for State-level activities pursuant to Sec. 
300.704.
    (2) After an SEA distributes funds under this part to an eligible 
LEA that is not serving any children with disabilities, as provided in 
paragraph (a) of this section, the SEA must determine, within a 
reasonable period of time prior to the end of the carryover period in 34 
CFR 76.709, whether the LEA has obligated the funds. The SEA may 
reallocate any of those funds not obligated by the LEA to other LEAs in 
the State that are not adequately providing special education and 
related services to all children with disabilities residing in the areas 
served by those other LEAs. The SEA may also retain those funds for use 
at the State level to the extent the State has not reserved the maximum 
amount of funds it is permitted to reserve for State-level activities 
pursuant to Sec. 300.704.

under section 619 of the Act and who previously received services under 
Part C of the Act until such children enter, or are eligible under State 
law to enter, kindergarten; or
    (f) At the State's discretion, to continue service coordination or

Sec. 300.815  Subgrants to LEAs.

    Each State that receives a grant under section 619 of the Act for 
any fiscal year must distribute all of the grant funds the State does 
not reserve under Sec. 300.812 to LEAs (including public charter 
schools that operate as LEAs) in the State that have established their 
eligibility under section 613 of the Act. Effective with funds that 
become available on July 1, 2009, each State must distribute funds to 
eligible LEAs that are responsible for providing education to children 
aged three through five years, including public charter schools that 
operate as LEAs, even if the LEA is not serving any preschool children 
with disabilities.

Sec. 300.816  Allocations to LEAs.

    (a) Base payments. The State must first award each LEA described in 
Sec. 300.815 the amount that agency would have received under section 
619 of the Act for fiscal year 1997 if the State had distributed 75 
percent of its grant for that year under section 619(c)(3), as such 
section was then in effect.
    (b) Base payment adjustments. For fiscal year 1998 and beyond--
    (1) If a new LEA is created, the State must divide the base 
allocation determined under paragraph (a) of this section for the LEAs 
that would have been responsible for serving children with disabilities 
now being served by the new LEA, among the new LEA and affected LEAs 
based on the relative numbers of children with disabilities ages three 
through five currently provided special education by each of the LEAs;
    (2) If one or more LEAs are combined into a single new LEA, the 
State must combine the base allocations of the merged LEAs;
    (3) If for two or more LEAs, geographic boundaries or administrative 
responsibility for providing services to children with disabilities ages 
three through five changes, the base allocations of affected LEAs must 
be redistributed among affected LEAs based on the relative numbers of 
children with disabilities ages three through five currently provided 
special education by each affected LEA; and
    (4) If an LEA received a base payment of zero in its first year of 
operation, the SEA must adjust the base payment for the first fiscal 
year after the first annual child count in which the LEA reports that it 
is serving any children with disabilities aged three through five years. 
The State must divide the base allocation determined under paragraph (a) 
of this section for the LEAs that would have been responsible for 
serving children with disabilities aged three through five years now 
being served by the LEA, among the LEA and affected LEAs based on the 
relative numbers of children with disabilities aged three through five 
years currently provided special education by each of the LEAs. This 
requirement takes effect with funds that become available on July 1, 
2009.
    (c) Allocation of remaining funds. After making allocations under 
paragraph (a) of this section, the State must--
    (1) Allocate 85 percent of any remaining funds to those LEAs on the 
basis of the relative numbers of children enrolled in public and private 
elementary schools and secondary schools within the LEA's jurisdiction; 
and
    (2) Allocate 15 percent of those remaining funds to those LEAs in 
accordance with their relative numbers of

[[Page 117]]

children living in poverty, as determined by the SEA.
    (d) Use of best data. For the purpose of making grants under this 
section, States must apply on a uniform basis across all LEAs the best 
data that are available to them on the numbers of children enrolled in 
public and private elementary and secondary schools and the numbers of 
children living in poverty.

Sec. 300.817  Reallocation of LEA funds.

    (a) If an SEA determines that an LEA is adequately providing FAPE to 
all children with disabilities aged three through five years residing in 
the area served by the LEA with State and local funds, the SEA may 
reallocate any portion of the funds under section 619 of the Act that 
are not needed by that LEA to provide FAPE, to other LEAs in the State 
that are not adequately providing special education and related services 
to all children with disabilities aged three through five years residing 
in the areas served by those other LEAs. The SEA may also retain those 
funds for use at the State level to the extent the State has not 
reserved the maximum amount of funds it is permitted to reserve for 
State-level activities pursuant to Sec. 300.812.
    (b) After an SEA distributes section 619 funds to an eligible LEA 
that is not serving any children with disabilities aged three through 
five years, as provided in Sec. 300.815, the SEA must determine, within 
a reasonable period of time prior to the end of the carryover period in 
34 CFR 76.709, whether the LEA has obligated the funds. The SEA may 
reallocate any of those funds not obligated by the LEA to other LEAs in 
the State that are not adequately providing special education and 
related services to all children with disabilities aged three through 
five years residing in the areas served by those other LEAs. The SEA may 
also retain those funds for use at the State level to the extent the 
State has not reserved the maximum amount of funds it is permitted to 
reserve for State-level activities pursuant to Sec. 300.812.

          Sec. Appendix A to Part 300--Excess Costs Calculation

    Except as otherwise provided, amounts provided to an LEA under Part 
B of the Act may be used only to pay the excess costs of providing 
special education and related services to children with disabilities. 
Excess costs are those costs for the education of an elementary school 
or secondary school student with a disability that are in excess of the 
average annual per student expenditure in an LEA during the preceding 
school year for an elementary school or secondary school student, as may 
be appropriate. An LEA must spend at least the average annual per 
student expenditure on the education of an elementary school or 
secondary school child with a disability before funds under Part B of 
the Act are used to pay the excess costs of providing special education 
and related services.
    Section 602(8) of the Act and Sec. 300.16 require the LEA to 
compute the minimum average amount separately for children with 
disabilities in its elementary schools and for children with 
disabilities in its secondary schools. LEAs may not compute the minimum 
average amount it must spend on the education of children with 
disabilities based on a combination of the enrollments in its elementary 
schools and secondary schools.
    The following example shows how to compute the minimum average 
amount an LEA must spend for `the education of each of its elementary 
school children with disabilities under section 602(3) of the Act before 
it may use funds under Part B of the Act.
    a. First the LEA must determine the total amount of its expenditures 
for elementary school students from all sources--local, State, and 
Federal (including Part B)--in the preceding school year. Only capital 
outlay and debt services are excluded.

    Example: The following is an example of a computation for children 
with disabilities enrolled in an LEA's elementary schools. In this 
example, the LEA had an average elementary school enrollment for the 
preceding school year of 800 (including 100 children

[[Page 118]]

with disabilities). The LEA spent the following amounts last year for 
elementary school students (including its elementary school children 
with disabilities):

 
 
 
(1)....................  From State and local tax funds.      $6,500,000
(2)....................  From Federal funds.............         600,000
                                                         ---------------
                          Total expenditures............       7,100,000
 

    Of this total, $60,000 was for capital outlay and debt service 
relating to the education of elementary school students. This must be 
subtracted from total expenditures.

 
 
 
(1)....................  Total Expenditures.............      $7,100,000
(2)....................  Less capital outlay and debt...         -60,000
                                                         ===============
                          Total expenditures for              $7,040,000
                          elementary school students
                          less capital outlay and debt.
 

    b. Next, the LEA must subtract from the total expenditures amounts 
spent for:
    (1) IDEA, Part B allocation,
    (2) ESEA, Title I, Part A allocation,
    (3) ESEA, Title III, Parts A and B allocation,
    (4) State and local funds for children with disabilities, and
    (5) State or local funds for programs under ESEA, Title I, Part A, 
and Title III, Parts A and B.
    These are funds that the LEA actually spent, not funds received last 
year but carried over for the current school year.

    Example: The LEA spent the following amounts for elementary school 
students last year:

 
 
 
(1)....................  From funds under IDEA, Part B         $ 200,000
                          allocation.
(2)....................  From funds under ESEA, Title I,         250,000
                          Part A allocation.
(3)....................  From funds under ESEA, Title             50,000
                          III, Parts A and B allocation.
(4)....................  From State funds and local              500,000
                          funds for children with
                          disabilities.
(5)....................  From State and local funds for          150,000
                          programs under ESEA, Title I,
                          Part A, and Title III, Parts A
                          and B.
                                                         ---------------
                          Total.........................       1,150,000
                                                         ---------------
(1)....................   Total expenditures less              7,040,000
                          capital outlay and debt.
(2)....................  Other deductions...............      -1,150,000
                                                         ===============
                          Total.........................      $5,890,000
 

    c. Except as otherwise provided, the LEA next must determine the 
average annual per student expenditure for its elementary schools 
dividing the average number of students enrolled in the elementary 
schools of the agency during the preceding year (including its children 
with disabilities) into the amount computed under the above paragraph. 
The amount obtained through this computation is the minimum amount the 
LEA must spend (on the average) for the education of each of its 
elementary school children with disabilities. Funds under Part B of the 
Act may be used only for costs over and above this minimum.

 
 
 
(1)....................  Amount from Step b.............      $5,890,000
(2)....................  Average number of students                  800
                          enrolled.
(3)....................  $5,890,000/800 Average annual           $ 7,362
                          per student expenditure.
 

    d. Except as otherwise provided, to determine the total minimum 
amount of funds the LEA must spend for the education of its elementary 
school children with disabilities in the LEA (not including capital 
outlay and debt service), the LEA must multiply the number of elementary 
school children with disabilities in the LEA times the average annual 
per student expenditure obtained in paragraph c above. Funds under Part 
B of the Act can only be used for excess costs over and above this 
minimum.

 
 
 
(1)....................  Number of children with                     100
                          disabilities in the LEA's
                          elementary schools.
(2)....................  Average annual per student              $ 7,362
                          expenditure.
(3)....................  $7,362 x 100...................
                          Total minimum amount of funds        $ 736,200
                          the LEA must spend for the
                          education of children with
                          disabilities enrolled in the
                          LEA's elementary schools
                          before using Part B funds.
 


<R05>
      Sec. Appendix B to Part 300--Proportionate Share Calculation

    Each LEA must expend, during the grant period, on the provision of 
special education and related services for the parentally-placed private 
school children with disabilities enrolled in private elementary schools 
and secondary schools located in the LEA an amount that is equal to--

[[Page 119]]

    (1) A proportionate share of the LEA's subgrant under section 611(f) 
of the Act for children with disabilities aged 3 through 21. This is an 
amount that is the same proportion of the LEA's total subgrant under 
section 611(f) of the Act as the number of parentally-placed private 
school children with disabilities aged 3 through 21 enrolled in private 
elementary schools and secondary schools located in the LEA is to the 
total number of children with disabilities enrolled in public and 
private elementary schools and secondary schools located in the LEA aged 
3 through 21; and
    (2) A proportionate share of the LEA's subgrant under section 619(g) 
of the Act for children with disabilities aged 3 through 5. This is an 
amount that is the same proportion of the LEA's total subgrant under 
section 619(g) of the Act as the total number of parentally-placed 
private school children with disabilities aged 3 through 5 enrolled in 
private elementary schools located in the LEA is to the total number of 
children with disabilities enrolled in public and private elementary 
schools located in the LEA aged 3 through 5.
    Consistent with section 612(a)(10)(A)(i) of the Act and Sec. 
300.133 of these regulations, annual expenditures for parentally-placed 
private school children with disabilities are calculated based on the 
total number of children with disabilities enrolled in public and 
private elementary schools and secondary schools located in the LEA 
eligible to receive special education and related services under Part B, 
as compared with the total number of eligible parentally-placed private 
school children with disabilities enrolled in private elementary schools 
located in the LEA. This ratio is used to determine the proportion of 
the LEA's total Part B subgrants under section 611(f) of the Act for 
children aged 3 through 21, and under section 619(g) of the Act for 
children aged 3 through 5, that is to be expended on services for 
parentally-placed private school children with disabilities enrolled in 
private elementary schools and secondary schools located in the LEA.
    The following is an example of how the proportionate share is 
calculated:
    There are 300 eligible children with disabilities enrolled in the 
Flintstone School District and 20 eligible parentally-placed private 
school children with disabilities enrolled in private elementary schools 
and secondary schools located in the LEA for a total of 320 eligible 
public and private school children with disabilities (note: 
proportionate share for parentally-placed private school children is 
based on total children eligible, not children served). The number of 
eligible parentally-placed private school children with disabilities 
(20) divided by the total number of eligible public and private school 
children with disabilities (320) indicates that 6.25 percent of the 
LEA's subgrant must be spent for the group of eligible parentally-placed 
children with disabilities enrolled in private elementary schools and 
secondary schools located in the LEA. Flintstone School District 
receives $152,500 in Federal flow through funds. Therefore, the LEA must 
spend $9,531.25 on special education or related services to the group of 
parentally-placed private school children with disabilities enrolled in 
private elementary schools and secondary schools located in the LEA. 
(Note: The LEA must calculate the proportionate share of IDEA funds 
before earmarking funds for any early intervening activities in Sec. 
300.226).
    The following outlines the calculations for the example of how the 
proportionate share is calculated.

    Under sections 612(a)(23)(A) and 674(e)(4) of the Individuals with 
Disabilities Education Act, as amended by the Individuals with 
Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004, the Secretary of 
Education establishes the

[[Page 120]]

NIMAS. Under section 674(e)(4) of the Act, the NIMAS applies to print 
instructional materials published after July 19, 2006. The purpose of 
the NIMAS is to help increase the availability and timely delivery of 
print instructional materials in accessible formats to blind or other 
persons with print disabilities in elementary and secondary schools.

           Technical Specifications--The Baseline Element Set

    The Baseline Element Set details the minimum requirement that must 
be delivered to fulfill the NIMAS. It is the responsibility of 
publishers to provide this NIMAS-conformant XML content file, a package 
file (OPF), a PDF-format copy of the title page (or whichever page(s) 
contain(s) ISBN and copyright information), and a full set of the 
content's images. All of the images included within a work must be 
provided in a folder and placeholders entered in the relevant XML 
document indicating their location (all images must be included). The 
preferred image type is SVG, next is either PNG or JPG format. Images 
should be rendered in the same size/proportion as their originals at 300 
dpi. Images should be named with relative path filenames in XML files 
(example: img id=``staricon4'' src=``./images/U10C02/staricon4.jpg'' 
alt=``star icon'').
    NIMAS-conformant content must be valid to the NIMAS 1.1 [see ANSI/
NISO Z39.86 2005 or subsequent revisions]. In addition, files are 
required to use the tags from the Baseline Element Set when such tags 
are appropriate. Publishers are encouraged to augment the required 
Baseline Element Set with tags from the Optional Element Set (elements 
not included in the Standard) as applicable. For the purposes of NIMAS, 
appropriate usage of elements, both baseline and optional, is defined by 
the DAISY Structure Guidelines. Files that do not follow these 
guidelines in the selection and application of tags are not conformant 
to this Standard. Both optional elements and appropriate structure 
guidelines may be located within Z39.86-2002 and Z39.86-2005 available 
from http://www.daisy.org/z3986/. Use of the most current standard is 
recommended.

                                     are expected to prefix those list
                                     items in content, rather than be
                                     implicitly generated.
li................................  Marks each list item in a <list<ls-

                                e. Tables
------------------------------------------------------------------------
table.............................  Contains cells of tabular data
                                     arranged in rows and columns. A
                                     <table<ls-thn-eq> may have a
                                     <caption<ls-thn-eq>. It may have
                                     descriptions of the columns in
                                     <col<ls-thn-eq>s or groupings of
                                     several <col<ls-thn-eq> in
                                     <colgroup<ls-thn-eq>. A simple
                                     <table<ls-thn-eq> may be made up of
                                     just rows <tr<ls-thn-eq>. A long
                                     table crossing several pages of the
                                     print book should have separate
                                     <pagenum<ls-thn-eq> values for each
                                     of the pages containing that
                                     <table<ls-thn-eq> indicated on the
                                     page where it starts. Note the
                                     logical order of optional <thead<ls-
                                     thn-eq>, optional <tfoot<ls-thn-
                                     eq>, then one or more of either
                                     <tbody<ls-thn-eq> or just rows
                                     <tr<ls-thn-eq>. This order
                                     accommodates simple or large,
                                     complex tables. The <thead<ls-thn-
                                     eq> and <tfoot<ls-thn-eq>
                                     information usually helps identify
                                     content of the <tbody<ls-thn-eq>
                                     rows. For a multiple-page print
                                     <table<ls-thn-eq> the <thead<ls-thn-
                                     eq> and <tfoot<ls-thn-eq> are
                                     repeated on each page, but not
                                     redundantly tagged.
td................................  Indicates a table cell containing
                                     data.
tr................................  Marks one row of a <table<ls-thn-eq>
                                     containing <th<ls-thn-eq> or <td<ls-
                                     thn-eq> cells.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
imggroup..........................  Provides a container for one or more
                                     <img<ls-thn-eq> and associated
                                     <caption<ls-thn-eq>(s) and
                                     <prodnote<ls-thn-eq>(s). A
                                     <prodnote<ls-thn-eq> may contain a
                                     description of the image. The
                                     content model allows: 1) multiple
                                     <img<ls-thn-eq> if they share a
                                     caption, with the ids of each
                                     <img<ls-thn-eq> in the <caption
                                     imgref=``id1 id2 ...''<ls-thn-eq>,

                                     each caption has the same <caption
                                     imgref=``xxx''<ls-thn-eq>, 3)
                                     multiple <prodnote<ls-thn-eq> if
                                     different versions are needed for
                                     different media (e.g., large print,
                                     braille, or print). If several
                                     <prodnote<ls-thn-eq> refer to a
                                     single <img id=``xxx''<ls-thn-eq>,

                                     eq>.
img...............................  Points to the image to be rendered.
                                     An <img<ls-thn-eq> may stand alone
                                     or be grouped using <imggroup<ls-
                                     thn-eq>. Note that providing
                                     extracted images is not a
                                     requirement of the NIMAS. If they
                                     are included, it is best to refer
                                     to them using <img<ls-thn-eq>
                                     within the <imggroup<ls-thn-eq>
                                     container.
caption...........................  Describes a <table<ls-thn-eq> or
                                     <img<ls-thn-eq>. If used with
                                     <table<ls-thn-eq> it must follow
                                     immediately after the <table<ls-thn-
                                     eq> start tag. If used with
                                     <imggroup<ls-thn-eq> it is not so
                                     constrained.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

             1. The Optional Elements and Guidelines for Use

    Publishers are encouraged to apply markup beyond the baseline 
(required) elements. The complete DTBook Element Set reflects the tags 
necessary to create the six types of Digital Talking Books and Braille 
output. Because of the present necessity to subdivide the creation of 
alternate format materials into distinct phases, the Panel determined 
that baseline elements would be provided by publishers, and optional 
elements would be added to the NIMAS-conformant files by third party 
conversion entities. In both circumstances the protocols for tagging 
digital files should conform to the most current ANSI/NISO Z39.86 
specification. Content converters are directed to the most current DAISY 
Structure Guidelines (http://www.daisy.org/z3986/) for guidance on their 
use.
    Since the publication of the original National File Format report 
from which the NIMAS technical specifications were derived, ANSI/NISO 
Z39.86-2002 was updated and is now ANSI/NISO Z39.86-2005. It may be best 
to avoid using the following optional elements which are no longer 
included in ANSI/NISO Z39.86-2005: style, notice, hr, and levelhd.
    Also, the following new elements were introduced by ANSI/NISO 
Z39.86-2005 and should be considered optional elements for the NIMAS: 
bridgehead, byline, covertitle, dateline, epigraph, linegroup, and poem. 
Please refer to ANSI/NISO Z39.86-2005 for additional information 
regarding these elements. To access the ANSI/NISO Z39.86-2005 
specification, go to http://www.daisy.org/z3986/.

                             2. Package File

    A package file describes a publication. It identifies all other 
files in the publication and provides descriptive and access information 
about them. A publication must include a package file conforming to the 
NIMAS. The package file is based on the Open eBook Publication Structure 
1.2 package file specification (For most recent detail please see http:/
/www.openebook.org/oebps/oebps1.2/download/oeb12-xhtml.htm#sec2). A 
NIMAS package file must be an XML-valid OeB PS 1.2 package file instance 
and must meet the following additional standards:
    The NIMAS Package File must include the following Dublin Core 
(dc:)metadata:
dc:Title.
dc:Creator (if applicable).
dc:Publisher.
dc:Date (Date of NIMAS-compliant file creation--yyyy-mm-dd).
dc:Format (=``NIMAS 1.0'').
dc:Identifier (a unique identifier for the NIMAS-compliant digital 
publication, e.g., print ISBN + ``-NIMAS''--exact format to be 
determined).
dc:Language (one instance, or multiple in the case of a foreign language 
textbook, etc.).
dc:Rights (details to be determined).
dc:Source (ISBN of print version of textbook).

    And the following x-metadata items:
nimas-SourceEdition (the edition of the print textbook).
nimas-SourceDate (date of publication of the print textbook).

    The following metadata were proposed also as a means of facilitating 
recordkeeping, storage and file retrieval:
dc:Subject (Lang Arts, Soc Studies, etc.).
nimas-grade (specific grade level of the print textbook, e.g.; Grade 6).
nimas gradeRange (specific grade range of the print textbook, e.g.; 
Grades 4-5).

    An additional suggestion references the use of:

dc:audience:educationLevel (for the grade and gradeRange identifiers, 
noting that Dublin Core recommends using

[[Page 123]]

educationLevel with an appropriate controlled vocabulary for context, 
and recommends the U.S. Department of Education's Level of Education 
vocabulary online at http://www.ed.gov/admin/reference/index.jsp. Using 
educationLevel obviates the need for a separate field for gradeRange 
since dc elements can repeat more than once. A book used in more than 
one grade would therefore have two elements, one with value ``Grade 4'' 
and another with value ``Grade 5.''

    A final determination as to which of these specific metadata 
elements to use needs to be clarified in practice. The package manifest 
must list all provided files (text, images, etc.).
(Note: For purposes of continuity and to minimize errors in 
transformation and processing, the NIMAS-compliant digital text should 
be provided as a single document.)

                          3. Modular Extensions

    The most current DAISY/NISO standard, formally the ANSI/NISO Z39.86, 
Specifications for the Digital Talking Book defines a comprehensive 
system for creating Digital Talking Books. A part of this standard is 
DTBook, an XML vocabulary that provides a core set of elements needed to 
produce most types of books. However, DTBook is not intended to be an 
exhaustive vocabulary for all types of books.
    Guidelines for the correct approach to extend the DAISY/NISO 
standard have been established. Mathematics, video support, testing, 
workbooks, music, dictionaries, chemistry, and searching are some of the 
extensions that have been discussed. Visit http://www.daisy.org/z3986/ 
to learn more about modular extensions.

Sec. Appendix D to Part 300--Maintenance of Effort and Early Intervening 
                                Services

    LEAs that seek to reduce their local maintenance of effort in 
accordance with Sec. 300.205(d) and use some of their Part B funds for 
early intervening services under Sec. 300.226 must do so with caution 
because the local maintenance of effort reduction provision and the 
authority to use Part B funds for early intervening services are 
interconnected. The decisions that an LEA makes about the amount of 
funds that it uses for one purpose affect the amount that it may use for 
the other. Below are examples that illustrate how Sec. Sec. 300.205(d) 
and 300.226(a) affect one another.
    Example 1: In this example, the amount that is 15 percent of the 
LEA's total grant (see Sec. 300.226(a)), which is the maximum amount 
that the LEA may use for early intervening services (EIS), is greater 
than the amount that may be used for local maintenance of effort (MOE) 
reduction (50 percent of the increase in the LEA's grant from the prior 
year's grant) (see Sec. 300.205(a)).

 
 
 
Prior Year's Allocation.................................       $900,000.
Current Year's Allocation...............................      1,000,000.
Increase................................................        100,000.
Maximum Available for MOE Reduction.....................         50,000.
Maximum Available for EIS...............................        150,000.
 

    If the LEA chooses to set aside $150,000 for EIS, it may not reduce 
its MOE (MOE maximum $50,000 less $150,000 for EIS means $0 can be used 
for MOE).
    If the LEA chooses to set aside $100,000 for EIS, it may not reduce 
its MOE (MOE maximum $50,000 less $100,000 for EIS means $0 can be used 
for MOE).
    If the LEA chooses to set aside $50,000 for EIS, it may not reduce 
its MOE (MOE maximum $50,000 less $50,000 for EIS means $0 can be used 
for MOE).
    If the LEA chooses to set aside $30,000 for EIS, it may reduce its 
MOE by $20,000 (MOE maximum $50,000 less $30,000 for EIS means $20,000 
can be used for MOE).
    If the LEA chooses to set aside $0 for EIS, it may reduce its MOE by 
$50,000 (MOE maximum $50,000 less $0 for EIS means $50,000 can be used 
for MOE).
    Example 2: In this example, the amount that is 15 percent of the 
LEA's total grant (see Sec. 300.226(a)), which is the maximum amount 
that the LEA may use for EIS, is less than the amount that may be used 
for MOE reduction (50 percent of the increase in the LEA's grant from 
the prior year's grant) (see Sec. 300.205(a)).

 
 
 
Prior Year's Allocation.................................     $1,000,000.
Current Year's Allocation...............................      2,000,000.
Increase................................................      1,000,000.
Maximum Available for MOE Reduction.....................        500,000.
Maximum Available for EIS...............................        300,000.
 

    If the LEA chooses to use no funds for MOE, it may set aside 
$300,000 for EIS (EIS maximum $300,000 less $0 means $300,000 for EIS).
    If the LEA chooses to use $100,000 for MOE, it may set aside 
$200,000 for EIS (EIS maximum $300,000 less $100,000 means $200,000 for 
EIS).
    If the LEA chooses to use $150,000 for MOE, it may set aside 
$150,000 for EIS (EIS maximum $300,000 less $150,000 means $150,000 for 
EIS).
    If the LEA chooses to use $300,000 for MOE, it may not set aside 
anything for EIS (EIS maximum $300,000 less $300,000 means $0 for EIS).
    If the LEA chooses to use $500,000 for MOE, it may not set aside 
anything for EIS (EIS maximum $300,000 less $500,000 means $0 for EIS).

Sec. 303.16  Infants and toddlers with disabilities.

    (a) As used in this part, infants and toddlers with disabilities 
means individuals from birth through age two who need early intervention 
services because they--
    (1) Are experiencing developmental delays, as measured by 
appropriate diagnostic instruments and procedures, in one or more of the 
following areas:
    (i) Cognitive development.
    (ii) Physical development, including vision and hearing.
    (iii) Communication development.
    (iv) Social or emotional development.
    (v) Adaptive development; or
    (2) Have a diagnosed physical or mental condition that has a high 
probability of resulting in developmental delay.
    (b) The term may also include, at a State's discretion, children 
from birth through age two who are at risk of having substantial 
developmental delays if early intervention services are not provided.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1432(5))
    Note 1: The phrase ``a diagnosed physical or mental condition that 
has a high probability of resulting in developmental delay,'' as used in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section, applies to a condition if it typically 
results in developmental delay. Examples of these conditions include 
chromosomal abnormalities; genetic or congenital disorders; severe 
sensory impairments, including hearing and vision; inborn errors of 
metabolism; disorders reflecting disturbance of the development of the 
nervous system; congenital infections; disorders secondary to exposure 
to toxic substances, including fetal alcohol syndrome; and severe 
attachment disorders.
    Note 2: With respect to paragraph (b) of this section, children who 
are at risk may be eligible under this part if a State elects to extend 
services to that population, even though they have not been identified 
as disabled.
    Under this provision, States have the authority to define who would 
be ``at risk of having substantial developmental delays if

[[Page 173]]

early intervention services are not provided.'' In defining the ``at 
risk'' population, States may include well-known biological and 
environmental factors that can be identified and that place infants and 
toddlers ``at risk'' for developmental delay. Commonly cited factors 
include low birth weight, respiratory distress as a newborn, lack of 
oxygen, brain hemorrhage, infection, nutritional deprivation, and a 
history of abuse or neglect. It should be noted that ``at risk'' factors 
do not predict the presence of a barrier to development, but they may 
indicate children who are at higher risk of developmental delay than 
children without these problems.

<R05>
Sec. 303.17  Multidisciplinary.

    As used in this part, multidisciplinary means the involvement of two 
or more disciplines or professions in the provision of integrated and 
coordinated services, including evaluation and assessment activities in 
Sec. 303.322 and development of the IFSP in Sec. 303.342.

or stepparent with whom the child lives, or a person who is legally 
responsible for the child's welfare); or
    (4) A surrogate parent who has been assigned in accordance with 
Sec. 303.406.
    (b) Foster parent. Unless State law prohibits a foster parent from 
acting as a parent, a State may allow a foster parent to act as a parent 
under Part C of the Act if--
    (1) The natural parents' authority to make the decisions required of 
parents under the Act has been extinguished under State law; and
    (2) The foster parent--
    (i) Has an ongoing, long-term parental relationship with the child;
    (ii) Is willing to make the decisions required of parents under the 
Act; and
    (iii) Has no interest that would conflict with the interests of the 
child.

must meet State standards. This provision implements a requirement that 
is similar to a longstanding provision under part B of the Act (i.e., 
that the State educational agency establish standards and ensure that 
those standards are currently met for all programs providing special 
education and related services).
    2. Section 303.12(a)(3)(ii) provides that early intervention 
services must be provided by qualified personnel.
    3. Section 303.361(b) requires statewide systems to have policies

part and the child's family to receive the rights, procedural 
safeguards, and services that are authorized to be provided under the 
State's early intervention program.
    (2) Each child eligible under this part and the child's family must

States may use or adapt those systems, so long as they are consistent

    Note 2: The legislative history of the 1991 amendments to the Act 
indicates that the use of the term ``service coordination'' was not 
intended to affect the authority to seek reimbursement for services 
provided under Medicaid or any other legislation that makes reference to 
``case management'' services. See H.R. Rep. No. 198, 102d Cong., 1st

Secretary that funds made available under this part will not be 
commingled with State funds.

(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 
1820-0550)

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1437(b)(5)(A))
    Note: As used in this part, commingle means depositing or recording 
funds in a general account without the ability to identify each specific 
source of funds for any expenditure. Under that general definition, it 
is clear that commingling is prohibited. However, to the extent that the 
funds from each of a series of Federal, State, local, and private 
funding sources can be identified--with a clear audit trail for each 
source--it is appropriate for those funds to be consolidated for 
carrying out a common purpose. In fact, a State may find it essential to 
set out a funding plan that incorporates, and accounts for, all sources 
of funds that can be targeted on a given activity or function related to 
the State's early intervention program.
    Thus, the assurance in this section is satisfied by the use of an 
accounting system that includes an ``audit trail'' of the expenditure of 
funds awarded under this part. Separate bank accounts are not required.

<R05>
Sec. 303.124  Prohibition against supplanting.

    (a) The statement must include an assurance satisfactory to the 
Secretary that Federal funds made available under this part will be used 
to supplement the level of State and local funds expended for children 
eligible under this part and their families and in no case to supplant 
those State and local funds.
    (b) To meet the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section, the 
total amount of State and local funds budgeted for expenditures in the 
current fiscal year for early intervention services for children 
eligible under this part and their families must be at least equal to 
the total amount of State and local funds actually expended for early 
intervention services for these children and their families in the most 
recent preceding fiscal year for which the information is available. 
Allowance may be made for--
    (1) Decreases in the number of children who are eligible to receive 
early intervention services under this part; and
    (2) Unusually large amounts of funds expended for such long-term 
purposes as the acquisition of equipment and the construction of 
facilities.

    (d) To meet the requirements in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, 
the lead agency shall arrange for copies of the directory to be 
available--
    (1) In each geographic region of the State, including rural areas; 
and
    (2) In places and a manner that ensure accessibility by persons with 
disabilities.

Sec. 303.322  Evaluation and assessment.

    (a) General. (1) Each system must include the performance of a 
timely, comprehensive, multidisciplinary evaluation of each child, birth 
through age two, referred for evaluation, and a family-directed 
identification of the needs of each child's family to appropriately 
assist in the development of the child.
    (2) The lead agency shall be responsible for ensuring that the 
requirements of this section are implemented by all affected public 
agencies and service providers in the State.
    (b) Definitions of evaluation and assessment. As used in this part--
    (1) Evaluation means the procedures used by appropriate qualified 
personnel to determine a child's initial and continuing eligibility 
under this part, consistent with the definition of ``infants and 
toddlers with disabilities'' in Sec. 303.16, including determining the 
status of the child in each of the developmental areas in paragraph 
(c)(3)(ii) of this section.
    (2) Assessment means the ongoing procedures used by appropriate 
qualified personnel throughout the period of a child's eligibility under 
this part to identify--
    (i) The child's unique strengths and needs and the services 
appropriate to meet those needs; and
    (ii) The resources, priorities, and concerns of the family and the 
supports and services necessary to enhance the family's capacity to meet 
the developmental needs of their infant or toddler with a disability.
    (c) Evaluation and assessment of the child. The evaluation and 
assessment of each child must--
    (1) Be conducted by personnel trained to utilize appropriate methods 
and procedures;
    (2) Be based on informed clinical opinion; and
    (3) Include the following:
    (i) A review of pertinent records related to the child's current 
health status and medical history.
    (ii) An evaluation of the child's level of functioning in each of 
the following developmental areas:
    (A) Cognitive development.
    (B) Physical development, including vision and hearing.
    (C) Communication development.
    (D) Social or emotional development.
    (E) Adaptive development.
    (iii) An assessment of the unique needs of the child in terms of 
each of the developmental areas in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, 
including the identification of services appropriate to meet those 
needs.
    (d) Family assessment. (1) Family assessments under this part must 
be family-directed and designed to determine the resources, priorities, 
and concerns of the family and the identification of the supports and 
services necessary to enhance the family's capacity to meet the 
developmental needs of the child.
    (2) Any assessment that is conducted must be voluntary on the part 
of the family.
    (3) If an assessment of the family is carried out, the assessment 
must--
    (i) Be conducted by personnel trained to utilize appropriate methods 
and procedures;
    (ii) Be based on information provided by the family through a 
personal interview; and
    (iii) Incorporate the family's description of its resources, 
priorities, and concerns related to enhancing the child's development.
    (e) Timelines. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this 
section, the evaluation and initial assessment of each child (including 
the family assessment) must be completed within the 45-day time period 
required in Sec. 303.321(e).
    (2) The lead agency shall develop procedures to ensure that in the 
event of exceptional circumstances that make

[[Page 187]]

it impossible to complete the evaluation and assessment within 45 days 
(e.g., if a child is ill), public agencies will--
    (i) Document those circumstances; and
    (ii) Develop and implement an interim IFSP, to the extent 
appropriate and consistent with Sec. 303.345 (b)(1) and (b)(2).

Sec. 303.323  Nondiscriminatory procedures.

    Each lead agency shall adopt nondiscriminatory evaluation and 
assessment procedures. The procedures must provide that public agencies 
responsible for the evaluation and assessment of children and families 
under this part shall ensure, at a minimum, that--
    (a) Tests and other evaluation materials and procedures are 
administered in the native language of the parents or other mode of 
communication, unless it is clearly not feasible to do so;
    (b) Any assessment and evaluation procedures and materials that are 
used are selected and administered so as not to be racially or 
culturally discriminatory;
    (c) No single procedure is used as the sole criterion for 
determining a child's eligibility under this part; and
    (d) Evaluations and assessments are conducted by qualified 
personnel.

               Individualized Family Service Plans (IFSPs)

<R05>
Sec. 303.340  General.

    (a) Each system must include policies and procedures regarding 
individualized family service plans (IFSPs) that meet the requirements 
of this section and Sec. Sec. 303.341 through 303.346.
    (b) As used in this part, individualized family service plan and 
IFSP mean a written plan for providing early intervention services to a 
child eligible under this part and the child's family. The plan must--
    (1) Be developed in accordance with Sec. Sec. 303.342 and 303.343;
    (2) Be based on the evaluation and assessment described in Sec. 
303.322; and
    (3) Include the matters specified in Sec. 303.344.
    (c) Lead agency responsibility. The lead agency shall ensure that an 
IFSP is developed and implemented for each eligible child, in accordance 
with the requirements of this part. If there is a dispute between 
agencies as to who has responsibility for developing or implementing an 
IFSP, the lead agency shall resolve the dispute or assign 
responsibility.

(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 
1820-0550)

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1436)
    Note: In instances where an eligible child must have both an IFSP 
and an individualized service plan under another Federal program, it may 
be possible to develop a single consolidated document, provided that it 
(1) contains all of the required information in Sec. 303.344, and (2) 
is developed in accordance with the requirements of this part.

<R05>
Sec. 303.341  [Reserved]

<R05>
Sec. 303.342  Procedures for IFSP development, review, and evaluation.

    (a) Meeting to develop initial IFSP--timelines. For a child who has 
been evaluated for the first time and determined to be eligible, a 
meeting to develop the initial IFSP must be conducted within the 45-day 
time period in Sec. 303.321(e).
    (b) Periodic review. (1) A review of the IFSP for a child and the 
child's family must be conducted every six months, or more frequently if 
conditions warrant, or if the family requests such a review. The purpose 
of the periodic review is to determine--
    (i) The degree to which progress toward achieving the outcomes is 
being made; and
    (ii) Whether modification or revision of the outcomes or services is 
necessary.
    (2) The review may be carried out by a meeting or by another means 
that is acceptable to the parents and other participants.

[[Page 188]]

    (c) Annual meeting to evaluate the IFSP. A meeting must be conducted 
on at least an annual basis to evaluate the IFSP for a child and the 
child's family, and, as appropriate, to revise its provisions. The 
results of any current evaluations conducted under Sec. 303.322(c), and 
other information available from the ongoing assessment of the child and 
family, must be used in determining what services are needed and will be 
provided.
    (d) Accessibility and convenience of meetings. (1) IFSP meetings 
must be conducted--
    (i) In settings and at times that are convenient to families; and
    (ii) In the native language of the family or other mode of 
communication used by the family, unless it is clearly not feasible to 
do so.
    (2) Meeting arrangements must be made with, and written notice 
provided to, the family and other participants early enough before the 
meeting date to ensure that they will be able to attend.
    (e) Parental consent. The contents of the IFSP must be fully 
explained to the parents and informed written consent from the parents 
must be obtained prior to the provision of early intervention services 
described in the plan. If the parents do not provide consent with 
respect to a particular early intervention service or withdraw consent 
after first providing it, that service may not be provided. The early 
intervention services to which parental consent is obtained must be 
provided.

1820-0550)

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1436)
    Note: The requirement for the annual evaluation incorporates the 
periodic review process. Therefore, it is necessary to have only one 
separate periodic review each year (i.e., six months after the initial 
and subsequent annual IFSP meetings), unless conditions warrant 
otherwise.

    Because the needs of infants and toddlers change so rapidly during 
the course of a year, certain evaluation procedures may need to be 
repeated before conducting the periodic reviews and annual evaluation 
meetings in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 303.343  Participants in IFSP meetings and periodic reviews.

    (a) Initial and annual IFSP meetings. (1) Each initial meeting and 
each annual meeting to evaluate the IFSP must include the following 
participants:
    (i) The parent or parents of the child.
    (ii) Other family members, as requested by the parent, if feasible 
to do so;
    (iii) An advocate or person outside of the family, if the parent 
requests that the person participate.
    (iv) The service coordinator who has been working with the family 
since the initial referral of the child for evaluation, or who has been 
designated by the public agency to be responsible for implementation of 
the IFSP.
    (v) A person or persons directly involved in conducting the 
evaluations and assessments in Sec. 303.322.
    (vi) As appropriate, persons who will be providing services to the 
child or family.
    (2) If a person listed in paragraph (a)(1)(v) of this section is 
unable to attend a meeting, arrangements must be made for the person's 
involvement through other means, including--
    (i) Participating in a telephone conference call;
    (ii) Having a knowledgeable authorized representative attend the 
meeting; or
    (iii) Making pertinent records available at the meeting.
    (b) Periodic review. Each periodic review must provide for the 
participation of persons in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (a)(1)(iv) of 
this section. If conditions warrant, provisions must be made for the 
participation of other representatives identified in paragraph (a) of 
this section.

not required under this part; and
    (ii) The funding sources to be used in paying for those services or 
the steps that will be taken to secure those services through public or 
private sources.
    (2) The requirement in paragraph (e)(1) of this section does not 
apply to routine medical services (e.g., immunizations and ``well-baby'' 
care), unless a child needs those services and the services are not 
otherwise available or being provided.
    (f) Dates; duration of services. The IFSP must include--
    (1) The projected dates for initiation of the services in paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section as soon as possible after the IFSP meetings 
described in Sec. 303.342; and
    (2) The anticipated duration of those services.
    (g) Service coordinator. (1) The IFSP must include the name of the 
service coordinator from the profession most immediately relevant to the 
child's or family's needs (or who is otherwise qualified to carry out 
all applicable responsibilities under this part), who will be 
responsible for the implementation of the IFSP and coordination with 
other agencies and persons.
    (2) In meeting the requirements in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, 
the public agency may--
    (i) Assign the same service coordinator who was appointed at the 
time that the child was initially referred for evaluation to be

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1436(d))
    Note 1: With respect to the requirements in paragraph (d) of this 
section, the appropriate location of services for some infants and 
toddlers might be a hospital setting--during the period in which they 
require extensive medical intervention. However, for these and other 
eligible children, early intervention services must be provided in 
natural environments (e.g., the home, child care centers, or other 
community settings) to the maximum extent appropriate to the needs of 
the child.
    Note 2: Throughout the process of developing and implementing IFSPs 
for an eligible child and the child's family, it is important for 
agencies to recognize the variety of roles that family members play in 
enhancing the child's development. It also is important that the degree 
to which the needs of the family are addressed in the IFSP process is 
determined in a collaborative manner with the full agreement and 
participation of the parents of the child. Parents retain the ultimate 
decision in determining whether they, their child, or other family 
members will accept or decline services under this part.
    Note 3: The early intervention services in paragraph (d) of this 
section are those services that a State is required to provide to a 
child in accordance with Sec. 303.12.
    The ``other services'' in paragraph (e) of this section are services 
that a child or family needs, but that are neither required nor covered 
under this part. While listing the non-required services in the IFSP 
does not mean that those services must be provided, their identification 
can be helpful to both the child's family and the service coordinator, 
for the following reasons: First, the IFSP would provide a comprehensive 
picture of the child's total service needs (including the need for 
medical and health services, as well as early intervention services). 
Second, it is appropriate for the service coordinator to assist the 
family in securing the non-required services (e.g., by (1) determining 
if there is a public agency that could provide financial assistance, if 
needed, (2) assisting in the preparation of eligibility claims or 
insurance claims, if needed, and (3) assisting the family in seeking out 
and arranging for the child to receive the needed medical-health 
services).
    Thus, to the extent appropriate, it is important for a State's 
procedures under this part to provide for ensuring that other needs of 
the child, and of the family related to enhancing the development of the 
child, such as medical and health needs, are considered and addressed, 
including determining (1) who will provide each service, and when, 
where, and how it will be provided, and (2) how the service will be paid 
for (e.g., through private insurance, an existing Federal-State funding 
source, such as Medicaid or EPSDT, or some other funding arrangement).
    Note 4: Although the IFSP must include information about each of the 
items in paragraphs (b) through (h) of this section, this does not mean 
that the IFSP must be a detailed, lengthy document. It might be a brief 
outline, with appropriate attachments that address each of the points in 
the paragraphs under this section. It is important for the IFSP itself 
to be clear about (a) what services are to be provided, (b) the actions 
that are to be taken by the service coordinator in initiating those 
services, and (c) what actions will be taken by the parents.

assessment in Sec. 303.322, if the following conditions are met:
    (a) Parental consent is obtained.
    (b) An interim IFSP is developed that includes--
    (1) The name of the service coordinator who will be responsible, 
consistent with Sec. 303.344(g), for implementation of the interim IFSP 
and coordination with other agencies and persons; and
    (2) The early intervention services that have been determined to be

(1) To facilitate the provision of services in the event that a child 
has obvious immediate needs that are identified, even at the time of 
referral (e.g., a physician recommends that a child with cerebral palsy 
begin receiving physical therapy as soon as possible), and (2) to ensure 
that the requirements for the timely evaluation and assessment are not 
circumvented.

Sec. 303.346  Responsibility and accountability.

    Each agency or person who has a direct role in the provision of 
early intervention services is responsible for making a good faith 
effort to assist each eligible child in achieving the outcomes in the 
child's IFSP. However, part C of the Act does not require that any 
agency or person be held accountable if an eligible child does not 
achieve the growth projected in the child's IFSP.

    (3) Profession or discipline means a specific occupational category 
that--
    (i) Provides early intervention services to children eligible under 
this part and their families;
    (ii) Has been established or designated by the State; and
    (iii) Has a required scope of responsibility and degree of 
supervision.
    (4) State approved or recognized certification, licensing, 
registration, or other comparable requirements means the requirements 
that a State legislature either has enacted or has authorized a State 
agency to promulgate through rules to establish the entry-level 
standards for employment in a specific profession or discipline in that 
State.
    (b)(1) Each statewide system must have policies and procedures 
relating to the establishment and maintenance of standards to ensure 
that personnel necessary to carry out the purposes of this part are 
appropriately and adequately prepared and trained.
    (2) The policies and procedures required in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section must provide for the establishment and maintenance of standards 
that are consistent with any State-approved or State-recognized 
certification, licensing, registration, or other comparable requirements 
that apply to the profession or discipline in which a person is 
providing early intervention services.
    (c) To the extent that a State's standards for a profession or 
discipline, including standards for temporary or emergency 
certification, are not based on the highest requirements in the State 
applicable to a specific profession or discipline, the State's 
application for assistance under this part must include the steps the 
State is taking, the procedures for notifying public agencies and 
personnel of those steps, and the timelines it has established for the 
retraining or hiring of personnel that meet appropriate professional 
requirements in the State.
    (d)(1) In meeting the requirements in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this 
section, a determination must be made about the status of personnel 
standards in the State. That determination must be based on current 
information that accurately describes, for each profession or discipline 
in which personnel are providing early intervention services, whether 
the applicable standards are consistent with the highest requirements in 
the State for that profession or discipline.
    (2) The information required in paragraph (d)(1) of this section 
must be on file in the lead agency, and available to the public.
    (e) In identifying the ``highest requirements in the State'' for 
purposes of this section, the requirements of all State statutes and the 
rules of all State agencies applicable to serving children eligible 
under this part and their families must be considered.
    (f) A State may allow paraprofessionals and assistants who are 
appropriately trained and supervised, in accordance with State law, 
regulations, or written policy, to assist in the provision of early 
intervention services to eligible children under this part.
    (g) In implementing this section, a State may adopt a policy that 
includes making ongoing good-faith efforts to recruit and hire 
appropriately and adequately trained personnel to provide early 
intervention services to eligible children, including, in a geographic 
area of the State where there is a shortage of personnel that meet these 
qualifications, the most qualified individuals available who are making 
satisfactory progress toward completing applicable course work necessary 
to meet the standards described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, 
consistent with State law, within 3 years.

    Note: This section requires that a State use its own existing 
highest requirements to determine the standards appropriate to personnel 
who provide early intervention services under this part. The regulations 
do not require States to set any specified training standard, such as a 
master's degree, for employment of personnel who provide services under 
this part.
    The regulations permit each State to determine the specific 
occupational categories required to provide early intervention services 
to children eligible under this part and their families, and to revise 
or expand these

[[Page 193]]

categories as needed. The professions or disciplines need not be limited 
to traditional occupational categories.

    (a) Written parental consent must be obtained before--
    (1) Conducting the initial evaluation and assessment of a child 
under Sec. 303.322; and
    (2) Initiating the provision of early intervention services (see

the services that would be available; and
    (2) Understands that the child will not be able to receive the 
evaluation and assessment or services unless consent is given.

agency may initiate procedures to challenge a parent's refusal to 
consent to the initial evaluation of the parent's child and, if 
successful, obtain the evaluation. This provision applies to eligible 
children under this part, since the part B evaluation requirement 
applies to all children with disabilities in a State, including infants 
and toddlers.

Sec. 303.405  Parent right to decline service.

    The parents of a child eligible under this part may determine

Sec. 303.406  Surrogate parents.

    (a) General. Each lead agency shall ensure that the rights of 
children eligible under this part are protected if--
    (1) No parent (as defined in Sec. 303.18) can be identified;
    (2) The public agency, after reasonable efforts, cannot discover the 
whereabouts of a parent; or
    (3) The child is a ward of the State under the laws of that State.
    (b) Duty of lead agency and other public agencies. The duty of the 
lead agency, or other public agency under paragraph (a) of this section,

    (2) Assigning a surrogate parent to the child.
    (c) Criteria for selecting surrogates. (1) The lead agency or other 
public agency may select a surrogate parent in any way permitted under

intervention services to the child or to any family member of the child.

[[Page 195]]

she is paid by a public agency to serve as a surrogate parent.
    (e) Responsibilities. A surrogate parent may represent a child in 
all matters related to--
    (1) The evaluation and assessment of the child;
    (2) Development and implementation of the child's IFSPs, including

      Mediation and Due Process Procedures for Parents and Children

<R05>
Sec. 303.419  Mediation.

    (a) General. Each State shall ensure that procedures are established 
and implemented to allow parties to disputes involving any matter 
described in Sec. 303.403(a) to resolve the disputes through a 
mediation process which, at a minimum, must be available whenever a 
hearing is requested under Sec. 303.420. The lead agency may either use 
the mediation system established under Part B of the Act or establish 
its own system.
    (b) Requirements. The procedures must meet the following 
requirements:
    (1) The procedures must ensure that the mediation process--
    (i) Is voluntary on the part of the parties;
    (ii) Is not used to deny or delay a parent's right to a due process 
hearing under Sec. 303.420, or to deny any other rights afforded under 
Part C of the Act; and
    (iii) Is conducted by a qualified and impartial mediator who is 
trained in effective mediation techniques.
    (2) The State shall maintain a list of individuals who are qualified 
mediators and knowledgeable in laws and regulations relating to the 
provision of special education and related services.
    (3) The State shall bear the cost of the mediation process, 
including the costs of meetings described in paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (4) Each session in the mediation process must be scheduled in a 
timely manner and must be held in a location that is convenient to the 
parties to the dispute.
    (5) An agreement reached by the parties to the dispute in the 
mediation process must be set forth in a written mediation agreement.
    (6) Discussions that occur during the mediation process must be 
confidential and may not be used as evidence in any subsequent due 
process hearings or civil proceedings, and the parties to the mediation 
process may be required to sign a confidentiality pledge prior to the 
commencement of the process.
    (c) Meeting to encourage mediation. A State may establish procedures 
to require parents who elect not to use the mediation process to meet, 
at a time and location convenient to the parents, with a disinterested 
party--
    (1) Who is under contract with a parent training and information 
center or community parent resource center in the State established 
under sections 682 or 683 of the Act, or an appropriate alternative 
dispute resolution entity; and
    (2) Who would explain the benefits of the mediation process and 
encourage the parents to use the process.

Sec. 303.420  Due process procedures.

    Each system must include written procedures including procedures for 
mediation as described in Sec. 303.419, for the timely administrative 
resolution of individual child complaints by parents concerning any of 
the matters in Sec. 303.403(a). A State may meet this requirement by--
    (a) Adopting the mediation and due process procedures in 34 CFR 
300.506 through 300.512 and developing procedures that meet the 
requirements of Sec. 303.425; or
    (b) Developing procedures that--
    (1) Meet the requirements in Sec. 303.419 and Sec. Sec. 303.421 
through 303.425; and

[[Page 196]]

    (2) Provide parents a means of filing a complaint.

(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 
1820-0550)

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1439(a)(1))
    Note 1: Sections 303.420 through 303.425 are concerned with the 
adoption of impartial procedures for resolving individual child 
complaints (i.e., complaints that generally affect only a single child 
or the child's family). These procedures require the appointment of a 
decision-maker who is impartial, as defined in Sec. 303.421(b), to 
resolve a dispute concerning any of the matters in Sec. 303.403(a). The 
decision of the impartial decision-maker is binding unless it is 
reversed on appeal.
    A different type of administrative procedure is included in 
Sec. Sec. 303.510 through 303.512 of subpart F of this part. Under 
those procedures, the lead agency is responsible for (1) investigating 
any complaint that it receives (including individual child complaints 
and those that are systemic in nature), and (2) resolving the complaint 
if the agency determines that a violation has occurred.
    Note 2: It is important that the administrative procedures developed 
by a State be designed to result in speedy resolution of complaints. An 
infant's or toddler's development is so rapid that undue delay could be 
potentially harmful.

Sec. 303.421  Appointment of an impartial person.

    (a) Qualifications and duties. An impartial person must be appointed 
to implement the complaint resolution process in this subpart. The 
person must--
    (1) Have knowledge about the provisions of this part and the needs 
of, and services available for, eligible children and their families; 
and
    (2) Perform the following duties:
    (i) Listen to the presentation of relevant viewpoints about the 
complaint, examine all information relevant to the issues, and seek to 
reach a timely resolution of the complaint.
    (ii) Provide a record of the proceedings, including a written 
decision.
    (b) Definition of impartial. (1) As used in this section, impartial 
means that the person appointed to implement the complaint resolution 
process--
    (i) Is not an employee of any agency or other entity involved in the 
provision of early intervention services or care of the child; and
    (ii) Does not have a personal or professional interest that would 
conflict with his or her objectivity in implementing the process.
    (2) A person who otherwise qualifies under paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section is not an employee of an agency solely because the person is 
paid by the agency to implement the complaint resolution process.

children eligible under this part are afforded the rights in paragraph 
(b) of this section in any administrative proceedings carried out under 
Sec. 303.420.
    (b) Rights. Any parent involved in an administrative proceeding has 
the right to--
    (1) Be accompanied and advised by counsel and by individuals with 
special knowledge or training with respect to early intervention 
services for children eligible under this part;
    (2) Present evidence and confront, cross-examine, and compel the 
attendance of witnesses;
    (3) Prohibit the introduction of any evidence at the proceeding that 
has not been disclosed to the parent at least five days before the 
proceeding;
    (4) Obtain a written or electronic verbatim transcription of the 
proceeding; and
    (5) Obtain written findings of fact and decisions.

reasonably convenient to the parents.
    (b) Each lead agency shall ensure that, not later than 30 days after 
the receipt of a parent's complaint, the impartial proceeding required 
under this

subpart is completed and a written decision mailed to each of the 
parties.

    Note: Under part B of the Act, States are allowed 45 days to conduct 
an impartial due process hearing (i.e., within 45 days after the receipt 
of a request for a hearing, a decision is reached and a copy of the 
decision is mailed to each of the parties). (See 34 CFR 300.512.) Thus, 
if a State, in meeting the requirements of Sec. 303.420, elects to 
adopt the due process procedures under part B, that State would also 
have 45 days for hearings. However, any State in that situation is 
encouraged (but not required) to accelerate the timeline for the due 
process hearing for children who are eligible under this part--from 45 
days to the 30-day timeline in this section. Because the needs of 
children in the birth-through-two-age range change so rapidly, quick 
resolution of complaints is important.

this part, including the right of parents to written notice of and 
written consent to the exchange of this information among agencies

for a violation that occurred not more than three years before the date 
on which the complaint is received by the public agency.

child's family; and
    (4) Set out any fees that will be charged for early intervention 
services and the basis for those fees.
    (c) Procedures to ensure the timely provision of services. No later

public or private insurance are not treated as program income for 
purposes of 34 CFR 80.25.

Sec. 303.523  Interagency agreements.

    (a) General. Each lead agency is responsible for entering into 
formal interagency agreements with other State-level agencies involved 
in the State's early intervention program. Each agreement must meet the 
requirements in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section.
    (b) Financial responsibility. Each agreement must define the

Sec. 303.143 (``financial designee'') shall assign financial 
responsibility to--
    (i) An agency, subject to the provisions in paragraph (b)(2) of this

inappropriately made--
    (i) The financial designee shall reassign the responsibility to the 
appropriate agency; and
    (ii) The lead agency shall make arrangements for reimbursement of 
any expenditures incurred by the agency originally assigned 
responsibility.

Sec. 303.526  Policy for contracting or otherwise arranging for 
          services.

    Each system must include a policy pertaining to contracting or 
making other arrangements with public or private service providers to 
provide early intervention services. The policy must include--
    (a) A requirement that all early intervention services must meet 
State standards and be consistent with the provisions of this part;

intervention services, so long as those agencies and individuals meet 
the requirements of this part.

<R05>
Sec. 303.527  Payor of last resort.

    (a) Nonsubstitution of funds. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section, funds under this part may not be used to satisfy a 
financial commitment for services that would otherwise have been paid 
for from another public or private source, including any medical program 
administered by the Secretary of Defense, but for the enactment of part 
C of the Act. Therefore, funds under this part may be used only for 
early intervention services that an eligible child needs but is not 
currently entitled to under any other Federal, State, local, or private 
source.
    (b) Interim payments--reimbursement. (1) If necessary to prevent a 
delay in the timely provision of services to an eligible child or the 
child's family, funds under this part may be used to pay the provider of 
services, pending reimbursement from the agency or entity that has 
ultimate responsibility for the payment.
    (2) Payments under paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be made 
for--
    (i) Early intervention services, as described in Sec. 303.12;
    (ii) Eligible health services (see Sec. 303.13); and
    (iii) Other functions and services authorized under this part, 
including child find and evaluation and assessment.
    (3) The provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section do not apply 
to medical services or ``well-baby'' health care (see Sec. 
303.13(c)(1)).
    (c) Non-reduction of benefits. Nothing in this part may be construed 
to permit a State to reduce medical or other assistance available or to 
alter eligibility under title V of the Social Security Act (SSA) 
(relating to maternal and child health) or title XIX of the SSA 
(relating to Medicaid for children eligible under this part) within the 
State.

(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 
1820-0550)

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1440)
    Note: The Congress intended that the enactment of part C not be 
construed as a license to any agency (including the lead agency and 
other agencies in the State) to withdraw funding for services that 
currently are or would be made available to eligible children but for 
the existence of the program under this part. Thus, the Congress 
intended that other funding sources would continue, and that there would 
be greater coordination among agencies regarding the payment of costs.
    The Congress further clarified its intent concerning payments under 
Medicaid by including in section 411(k)(13) of the Medicare Catastrophic 
Coverage Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-360) an amendment to title XIX of the 
Social Security Act. That amendment states, in effect, that nothing in 
this title shall be construed as prohibiting or restricting, or 
authorizing the Secretary of Health and Human Services to prohibit or 
restrict, payment under subsection (a) of section 1903 of the Social 
Security Act for medical assistance for covered services furnished to an 
infant or toddler with a disability because those services are included 
in the child's IFSP adopted pursuant to part C of the Act.

    Note to paragraph (b)(42): Post-employment services are intended to 
ensure that the employment outcome remains consistent with the 
individual's strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, 
capabilities, interests, and informed choice. These services are 
available to meet rehabilitation needs that do not require a complex and 
comprehensive provision of services and, thus, should be limited in 
scope and duration. If more comprehensive services are required, then a 
new rehabilitation effort should be considered. Post-employment services 
are to be provided under an amended individualized plan for employment; 
thus, a re-determination of eligibility is not required. The provision 
of post-employment services is subject to the same requirements in this 
part as the provision of any other vocational rehabilitation service. 
Post-employment services are available to assist an individual to 
maintain employment, e.g., the individual's employment is jeopardized 
because of conflicts with supervisors or co-workers, and the individual 
needs mental health services and counseling to maintain the employment; 
to regain employment, e.g., the individual's job is eliminated through 
reorganization and new placement services are needed; and to advance in 
employment, e.g., the employment is no longer consistent with the 
individual's strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, 
capabilities, interests, and informed choice.

mediator means an individual who--
    (A) Is not an employee of a public agency (other than an 
administrative law judge, hearing examiner, employee of a State office 
of mediators, or employee of an institution of higher education);
    (B) Is not a member of the State Rehabilitation Council for the 
designated State unit;
    (C) Has not been involved previously in the vocational 
rehabilitation of the applicant or eligible individual;
    (D) Is knowledgeable of the vocational rehabilitation program and 
the applicable Federal and State laws, regulations, and policies 
governing the provision of vocational rehabilitation services;
    (E) Has been trained in effective mediation techniques consistent 
with any State-approved or -recognized certification, licensing, 
registration, or other requirements; and
    (F) Has no personal, professional, or financial interest that would 
be in conflict with the objectivity of the individual during the 
mediation proceedings.
    (ii) An individual serving as a mediator is not considered to be an 
employee of the designated State agency or designated State unit for the 
purposes of this definition solely because the individual is paid by the 
designated State agency or designated State unit to serve as a mediator.

able to provide the full range of services listed in section 103(a) of 
the Act and Sec. 361.48, as appropriate, to all eligible individuals 
or, in the event that vocational rehabilitation services cannot be 
provided to all eligible individuals in the State who apply for the 
services, include in the State plan the order to be followed in 
selecting eligible individuals to be provided vocational rehabilitation 
services.
    (2) The ability of the designated State unit to provide the full 
range of vocational rehabilitation services to all eligible individuals 
must be supported by a determination that satisfies the requirements of 
paragraph (b) or (c) of this section and a determination that, on the 
basis of the designated State unit's projected fiscal and personnel 
resources and its assessment of the rehabilitation needs of individuals 
with significant disabilities within the State, it can--
    (i) Continue to provide services to all individuals currently 
receiving services;

apply for services in the next fiscal year;
    (iii) Provide services to all individuals who are expected to be 
determined eligible in the next fiscal year; and
    (iv) Meet all program requirements.
    (3) If the designated State unit is unable to provide the full range 
vocational rehabilitation services to all eligible individuals in the 
State who apply for the services, the State plan must--
    (i) Show the order to be followed in selecting eligible individuals 
to be provided vocational rehabilitation services;
    (ii) Provide a justification for the order of selection;
    (iii) Identify service and outcome goals and the time within which 
the goals may be achieved for individuals in each priority category 
within the order, as required under Sec. 361.29(c)(5); and
    (iv) Assure that--
    (A) In accordance with criteria established by the State for the 
order of selection, individuals with the most significant disabilities 
will be selected first for the provision of vocational rehabilitation 
services; and
    (B) Individuals who do not meet the order of selection criteria will 
have access to services provided through the information and referral 
system established under Sec. 361.37.
    (b) Basis for assurance that services can be provided to all 
eligible individuals. (1) For a designated State unit that determined, 
for the current fiscal year and the preceding fiscal year, that it is 
able to provide the full range of services, as appropriate, to all 
eligible individuals, the State unit, during the current fiscal and 
preceding fiscal year, must have in fact--
    (i) Provided assessment services to all applicants and the full 
range of services, as appropriate, to all eligible individuals;
    (ii) Made referral forms widely available throughout the State;
    (iii) Conducted outreach efforts to identify and serve individuals 
with disabilities who have been unserved or underserved by the 
vocational rehabilitation system; and
    (iv) Not delayed, through waiting lists or other means, 
determinations of eligibility, the development of individualized plans 
for employment for individuals determined eligible for vocational 
rehabilitation services, or the provision of services for eligible 
individuals for whom individualized plans for employment have been 
developed.
    (2) For a designated State unit that was unable to provide the full 
range of

[[Page 262]]

services to all eligible individuals during the current or preceding 
fiscal year or that has not met the requirements in paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section, the determination that the designated State unit is able 
to provide the full range of vocational rehabilitation services to all 
eligible individuals in the next fiscal year must be based on--
    (i) Circumstances that have changed that will allow the designated 
State unit to meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section 
in the next fiscal year, including--
    (A) An estimate of the number of and projected costs of serving, in 
the next fiscal year, individuals with existing individualized plans for 
employment;
    (B) The projected number of individuals with disabilities who will 
apply for services and will be determined eligible in the next fiscal 
year and the projected costs of serving those individuals;
    (C) The projected costs of administering the program in the next 
fiscal year, including, but not limited to, costs of staff salaries and 
benefits, outreach activities, and required statewide studies; and
    (D) The projected revenues and projected number of qualified 
personnel for the program in the next fiscal year;
    (ii) Comparable data, as relevant, for the current or preceding 
fiscal year, or for both years, of the costs listed in paragraphs 
(b)(2)(i)(A) through (C) of this section and the resources identified in 
paragraph (b)(2)(i)(D) of this section and an explanation of any 
projected increases or decreases in these costs and resources; and
    (iii) A determination that the projected revenues and the projected 
number of qualified personnel for the program in the next fiscal year 
are adequate to cover the costs identified in paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(A) 
through (C) of this section to ensure the provision of the full range of 
services, as appropriate, to all eligible individuals.
    (c) Determining need for establishing and implementing an order of 
selection. (1) The designated State unit must determine, prior to the 
beginning of each fiscal year, whether to establish and implement an 
order of selection.
    (2) If the designated State unit determines that it does not need to 
establish an order of selection, it must reevaluate this determination 
whenever changed circumstances during the course of a fiscal year, such 
as a decrease in its fiscal or personnel resources or an increase in its 
program costs, indicate that it may no longer be able to provide the 
full range of services, as appropriate, to all eligible individuals, as 
described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (3) If a DSU establishes an order of selection, but determines that 
it does not need to implement that order at the beginning of the fiscal 
year, it must continue to meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section, or it must implement the order of selection by closing one 
or more priority categories.
    (d) Establishing an order of selection--(1) Basis for order of 
selection. An order of selection must be based on a refinement of the 
three criteria in the definition of ``individual with a significant 
disability'' in section 7(21)(A) of the Act and Sec. 361.5(b)(31).
    (2) Factors that cannot be used in determining order of selection of 
eligible individuals. An order of selection may not be based on any

disability; and
    (4) Ensure that its funding arrangements for providing services 
under the State plan, including third-party arrangements and awards 
under the establishment authority, are consistent with the order of 
selection. If any funding arrangements are inconsistent with the order 
of selection, the designated State unit must renegotiate these funding

    (a) General provisions. The State plan must assure that--
    (1) The designated State agency will implement an information and 
referral system adequate to ensure that individuals with disabilities, 
including eligible individuals who do not meet the agency's order of 
selection criteria for receiving vocational rehabilitation services if 
the agency is operating on an order of selection, are provided accurate 
vocational rehabilitation information and guidance (which may include 
counseling and referral for job placement) using appropriate modes of 
communication to assist them in preparing for, securing, retaining, or

individual with information concerning the availability of employment 
options, and of vocational rehabilitation services, in integrated 
settings;
    (3) Inform the individual that services under the vocational 
rehabilitation program can be provided to eligible individuals in an 
extended employment setting if necessary for purposes of training or 
otherwise preparing for employment in an integrated setting;
    (4) Inform the individual that, if he or she initially chooses not 
to pursue employment in an integrated setting, he or she can seek 
services from the designated State unit at a later date if, at that 
time, he or she chooses to pursue employment in an integrated setting; 
and
    (5) Refer the individual, as appropriate, to the Social Security 
Administration in order to obtain information concerning the ability of 
individuals with disabilities to work while receiving benefits from the 
Social Security Administration.
    (c) Criteria for appropriate referrals. In making the referrals 
identified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the designated State 
unit must--
    (1) Refer the individual to Federal or State programs, including 
programs carried out by other components of the

[[Page 264]]

statewide workforce investment system, best suited to address the 
specific employment needs of an individual with a disability; and
    (2) Provide the individual who is being referred--
    (i) A notice of the referral by the designated State agency to the 
agency carrying out the program;
    (ii) Information identifying a specific point of contact within the 
agency to which the individual is being referred; and
    (iii) Information and advice regarding the most suitable services to 
assist the individual to prepare for, secure, retain, or regain

services under this section to eligible individuals who are not in the 
priority category or categories to receive vocational rehabilitation 
services under the State's order of selection, the State unit must 
identify, as part of its reporting under section 101(a)(10) of the Act 
and Sec. 361.40, the number of eligible individuals who did not meet 
the agency's order of selection criteria for receiving vocational 
rehabilitation services and did receive information and referral 
services under this section.

Sec. 361.41  Processing referrals and applications.

    (a) Referrals. The designated State unit must establish and 
implement standards for the prompt and equitable handling of referrals 
of individuals for vocational rehabilitation services, including 
referrals of individuals made through the One-Stop service delivery 
systems established under section 121 of the Workforce Investment Act of

an eligibility determination must be made within 60 days, unless--
    (i) Exceptional and unforeseen circumstances beyond the control of 
the designated State unit preclude making an eligibility determination 
within 60 days and the designated State unit and the individual agree to 
a specific extension of time; or
    (ii) An exploration of the individual's abilities, capabilities, and

Sec. 361.42  Assessment for determining eligibility and priority for services.

    In order to determine whether an individual is eligible for 
vocational rehabilitation services and the individual's priority under 
an order of selection for services (if the State is operating under an 
order of selection), the designated State unit must conduct an 
assessment for determining eligibility and priority for services. The 
assessment must be conducted in the most integrated setting possible, 
consistent with the individual's needs and informed choice, and in 
accordance with the following provisions:
    (a) Eligibility requirements--(1) Basic requirements. The designated 
State unit's determination of an applicant's eligibility for vocational 
rehabilitation services must be based only on the following 
requirements:
    (i) A determination by qualified personnel that the applicant has a 
physical or mental impairment.
    (ii) A determination by qualified personnel that the applicant's 
physical or mental impairment constitutes or results in a substantial 
impediment to employment for the applicant.
    (iii) A determination by a qualified vocational rehabilitation 
counselor employed by the designated State unit that the applicant 
requires vocational rehabilitation services to prepare for, secure, 
retain, or regain employment consistent with the applicant's unique 
strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, capabilities, 
interests, and informed choice.
    (iv) A presumption, in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section, that the applicant can benefit in terms of an employment 
outcome from the provision of vocational rehabilitation services.
    (2) Presumption of benefit. The designated State unit must presume 
that an applicant who meets the eligibility requirements in paragraphs 
(a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section can benefit in terms of an employment 
outcome unless it demonstrates, based on clear and convincing evidence, 
that the applicant is incapable of benefiting in terms of an employment 
outcome from vocational rehabilitation services due to the severity of 
the applicant's disability.
    (3) Presumption of eligibility for Social Security recipients and 
beneficiaries. (i) Any applicant who has been determined eligible for 
Social Security benefits under Title II or Title XVI of the Social 
Security Act is--
    (A) Presumed eligible for vocational rehabilitation services under 
paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section; and
    (B) Considered an individual with a significant disability as 
defined in Sec. 361.5(b)(31).
    (ii) If an applicant for vocational rehabilitation services asserts 
that he or she is eligible for Social Security benefits under Title II 
or Title XVI of the Social Security Act (and, therefore, is presumed 
eligible for vocational rehabilitation services under paragraph 
(a)(3)(i)(A) of this section), but is unable to provide appropriate 
evidence, such as an award letter, to support that assertion, the State 
unit must verify the applicant's eligibility under Title II or Title XVI 
of the Social Security Act by contacting the Social Security 
Administration. This verification must be made within a reasonable 
period of time that enables the State unit to determine the applicant's 
eligibility for vocational rehabilitation services within 60 days of the 
individual submitting an application for services in accordance with 
Sec. 361.41(b)(2).
    (4) Achievement of an employment outcome. Any eligible 
rehabilitation services is based on the individual being eligible for 
Social Security benefits

[[Page 268]]

under Title II or Title XVI of the Social Security Act, must intend to 
achieve an employment outcome that is consistent with the applicant's 
unique strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, 
capabilities, interests, and informed choice.
    (i) The State unit is responsible for informing individuals, through 
its application process for vocational rehabilitation services, that 
individuals who receive services under the program must intend to 
achieve an employment outcome.
    (ii) The applicant's completion of the application process for 
vocational rehabilitation services is sufficient evidence of the 
individual's intent to achieve an employment outcome, and no additional 
demonstration on the part of the applicant is required for purposes of 
satisfying paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
    (5) Interpretation. Nothing in this section, including paragraph 
(a)(3)(i), is to be construed to create an entitlement to any vocational 
rehabilitation service.
    (b) Interim determination of eligibility. (1) The designated State 
unit may initiate the provision of vocational rehabilitation services 
for an applicant on the basis of an interim determination of eligibility 
prior to the 60-day period described in Sec. 361.41(b)(2).
    (2) If a State chooses to make interim determinations of 
eligibility, the designated State unit must--
    (i) Establish criteria and conditions for making those 
determinations;
    (ii) Develop and implement procedures for making the determinations; 
and
    (iii) Determine the scope of services that may be provided pending 
the final determination of eligibility.
    (3) If a State elects to use an interim eligibility determination, 
the designated State unit must make a final determination of eligibility 
within 60 days of the individual submitting an application for services 
in accordance with Sec. 361.41(b)(2).
    (c) Prohibited factors. (1) The State plan must assure that the 
State unit will not impose, as part of determining eligibility under 
this section, a duration of residence requirement that excludes from 
services any applicant who is present in the State.
    (2) In making a determination of eligibility under this section, the 
designated State unit also must ensure that--
    (i) No applicant or group of applicants is excluded or found 
ineligible solely on the basis of the type of disability; and
    (ii) The eligibility requirements are applied without regard to 
the--
    (A) Age, gender, race, color, or national origin of the applicant;
    (B) Type of expected employment outcome;
    (C) Source of referral for vocational rehabilitation services; and
    (D) Particular service needs or anticipated cost of services 
required by an applicant or the income level of an applicant or 
applicant's family.
    (d) Review and assessment of data for eligibility determination. 
Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, the designated 
State unit--
    (1) Must base its determination of each of the basic eligibility 
requirements in paragraph (a) of this section on--
    (i) A review and assessment of existing data, including counselor 
observations, education records, information provided by the individual 
or the individual's family, particularly information used by education 
officials, and determinations made by officials of other agencies; and
    (ii) To the extent existing data do not describe the current 
functioning of the individual or are unavailable, insufficient, or 
inappropriate to make an eligibility determination, an assessment of 
additional data resulting from the provision of vocational 
rehabilitation services, including trial work experiences, assistive 
technology devices and services, personal assistance services, and any 
other support services that are necessary to determine whether an 
individual is eligible; and
    (2) Must base its presumption under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this 
section that an applicant who has been determined eligible for Social 
Security benefits under Title II or Title XVI of the Social Security Act 
satisfies each of the

[[Page 269]]

basic eligibility requirements in paragraph (a) of this section on 
determinations made by the Social Security Administration.
    (e) Trial work experiences for individuals with significant 
disabilities. (1) Prior to any determination that an individual with a 
disability is incapable of benefiting from vocational rehabilitation 
services in terms of an employment outcome because of the severity of 
that individual's disability, the designated State unit must conduct an 
exploration of the individual's abilities, capabilities, and capacity to 
perform in realistic work situations to determine whether or not there 
is clear and convincing evidence to support such a determination.
    (2)(i) The designated State unit must develop a written plan to 
assess periodically the individual's abilities, capabilities, and 
capacity to perform in work situations through the use of trial work 
experiences, which must be provided in the most integrated setting 
possible, consistent with the informed choice and rehabilitation needs 
of the individual.
    (ii) Trial work experiences include supported employment, on-the-job 
training, and other experiences using realistic work settings.
    (iii) Trial work experiences must be of sufficient variety and over 
a sufficient period of time for the designated State unit to determine 
that--
    (A) There is sufficient evidence to conclude that the individual can 
benefit from the provision of vocational rehabilitation services in 
terms of an employment outcome; or
    (B) There is clear and convincing evidence that the individual is 
incapable of benefiting from vocational rehabilitation services in terms 
of an employment outcome due to the severity of the individual's 
disability.
    (iv) The designated State unit must provide appropriate supports, 
including assistive technology devices and services and personal 
assistance services, to accommodate the rehabilitation needs of the 
individual during the trial work experiences.
    (f) Extended evaluation for certain individuals with significant 
disabilities. (1) Under limited circumstances if an individual cannot 
take advantage of trial work experiences or if options for trial work 
experiences have been exhausted before the State unit is able to make 
the determinations described in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section, 
the designated State unit must conduct an extended evaluation to make 
these determinations.
    (2) During the extended evaluation period, vocational rehabilitation 
services must be provided in the most integrated setting possible, 
consistent with the informed choice and rehabilitation needs of the 
individual.
    (3) During the extended evaluation period, the designated State unit 
must develop a written plan for providing services necessary to make a 
determination under paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section.
    (4) During the extended evaluation period, the designated State unit 
provides only those services that are necessary to make the 
determinations described in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section and 
terminates extended evaluation services when the State unit is able to 
make the determinations.
    (g) Data for determination of priority for services under an order 
of selection. If the designated State unit is operating under an order 
of selection for services, as provided in Sec. 361.36, the State unit 
must base its priority assignments on--
    (1) A review of the data that was developed under paragraphs (d) and 
(e) of this section to make the eligibility determination; and
    (2) An assessment of additional data, to the extent necessary.

    Note to Sec. 361.42: Clear and convincing evidence means that the 
designated State unit shall have a high degree of certainty before it 
can conclude that an individual is incapable of benefiting from services 
in terms of an employment outcome. The ``clear and convincing'' standard 
constitutes the highest standard used in our civil system of law and is 
to be individually applied on a case-by-

[[Page 270]]

case basis. The term clear means unequivocal. For example, the use of an 
intelligence test result alone would not constitute clear and convincing 
evidence. Clear and convincing evidence might include a description of 
assessments, including situational assessments and supported employment 
assessments, from service providers who have concluded that they would 
be unable to meet the individual's needs due to the severity of the 
individual's disability. The demonstration of ``clear and convincing

Sec. 361.50  Written policies governing the provision of services for
individuals with disabilities.

    (a) Policies. The State unit must develop and maintain written 
policies covering the nature and scope of each of the vocational 
rehabilitation services specified in Sec. 361.48 and the criteria under 
which each service is provided. The policies must ensure that the 
provision of services is based on the rehabilitation needs of each 
individual as identified in that individual's IPE and is consistent with 
the individual's informed choice. The written policies may not establish 
any arbitrary limits on the nature and scope of vocational 
rehabilitation services to be provided to the individual to achieve an 
employment outcome. The policies must be developed in accordance with 
the following provisions:
    (b) Out-of-State services. (1) The State unit may establish a 
preference for in-

[[Page 278]]

State services, provided that the preference does not effectively deny 
an individual a necessary service. If the individual chooses an out-of-
State service at a higher cost than an in-State service, if either 
service would meet the individual's rehabilitation needs, the designated 
State unit is not responsible for those costs in excess of the cost of 
the in-State service.
    (2) The State unit may not establish policies that effectively 
prohibit the provision of out-of-State services.
    (c) Payment for services. (1) The State unit must establish and 
maintain written policies to govern the rates of payment for all 
purchased vocational rehabilitation services.
    (2) The State unit may establish a fee schedule designed to ensure a 
reasonable cost to the program for each service, if the schedule is--
    (i) Not so low as to effectively deny an individual a necessary 
service; and
    (ii) Not absolute and permits exceptions so that individual needs 
can be addressed.
    (3) The State unit may not place absolute dollar limits on specific 
service categories or on the total services provided to an individual.
    (d) Duration of services. (1) The State unit may establish 
reasonable time periods for the provision of services provided that the 
time periods are--
    (i) Not so short as to effectively deny an individual a necessary 
service; and
    (ii) Not absolute and permit exceptions so that individual needs can 
be addressed.
    (2) The State unit may not establish absolute time limits on the 
provision of specific services or on the provision of services to an 
individual. The duration of each service needed by an individual must be 
determined on an individual basis and reflected in that individual's 
individualized plan for employment.
    (e) Authorization of services. The State unit must establish 
policies related to the timely authorization of services, including any 
conditions under which verbal authorization can be given.

Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, the Americans with Disabilities Act 
of 1990, section 504 of the Act, and the regulations implementing these 
laws.
    (b) Affirmative action. The State plan must assure that community 
rehabilitation programs that receive assistance under part B of Title I 
of the Act take affirmative action to employ and advance in employment 
qualified individuals with disabilities covered under and on the same 
terms and conditions as in section 503 of the Act.
    (c) Special communication needs personnel. The designated State unit 
must ensure that providers of vocational rehabilitation services are 
able to communicate--
    (1) In the native language of applicants and eligible individuals 
who have limited English speaking ability; and
    (2) By using appropriate modes of communication used by applicants 
and eligible individuals.

of communication, about the availability of and opportunities to 
exercise informed choice, including the availability of support services 
for individuals with cognitive or other disabilities who require

rehabilitation process;
    (2) Assisting applicants and eligible individuals in exercising 
informed choice in decisions related to the provision of assessment

    (3) Developing and implementing flexible procurement policies and 
methods that facilitate the provision of vocational rehabilitation 
services and that afford eligible individuals meaningful choices among 
the methods used to procure vocational rehabilitation services;
    (4) Assisting eligible individuals or, as appropriate, the 
individuals' representatives in acquiring information that enables them 
to exercise informed choice in the development of their IPEs with 
respect to the selection of the--
    (i) Employment outcome;
    (ii) Specific vocational rehabilitation services needed to achieve

needs and during development of the IPE, the designated State unit must 
provide the individual or the individual's representative, or assist the 
individual or the individual's representative in acquiring, information 
necessary to make an informed choice about the specific vocational 
rehabilitation services, including the providers of those services, that 
are needed to achieve the individual's employment outcome. This

part, the costs of the vocational rehabilitation services.
    (2) If comparable services or benefits exist under any other 
program, but are not available to the individual at the time needed to

services may request, or, if appropriate, may request through the 
individual's representative, a timely review of that determination. The 
procedures must be in accordance with paragraphs (b) through (k) of this 
section:
    (b) General requirements--(1) Notification. Procedures established 
by the State unit under this section must provide an applicant or

section with respect to determinations made by designated State unit 
personnel that affect the provision of vocational rehabilitation 
services to an applicant or eligible individual;
    (iii) The names and addresses of individuals with whom requests for 
mediation or due process hearings may be filed;

[[Page 284]]

    (iv) The manner in which a mediator or impartial hearing officer may 
be selected consistent with the requirements of paragraphs (d) and (f) 
of this section; and
    (v) The availability of the client assistance program, established 
under 34 CFR part 370, to assist the applicant or eligible individual

the individual's representative with an opportunity to submit during 
mediation sessions or due process hearings evidence and other 
information that supports the applicant's or eligible individual's 
position; and

during mediation sessions or due process hearings by counsel or other 
advocate selected by the applicant or eligible individual.
    (4) Impact on provision of services. The State unit may not 
institute a suspension, reduction, or termination of vocational 
rehabilitation services being provided to an applicant or eligible 
individual, including evaluation and assessment services and IPE 
development, pending a resolution through mediation, pending a decision

resolution under this section unless--
    (i) The individual or, in appropriate cases, the individual's 
representative requests a suspension, reduction, or termination of 
services; or
    (ii) The State agency has evidence that the services have been 
obtained through misrepresentation, fraud, collusion, or criminal 
conduct on the part of the individual or the individual's

rehabilitation services pursuant to Sec. 361.43 are permitted to 
challenge the determinations of ineligibility under the procedures 
described in this section.
    (c) Informal dispute resolution. The State unit may develop an 
informal process for resolving a request for review without conducting

used to deny the right of an applicant or eligible individual to a 
hearing under paragraph (e) of this section or any other right provided 
under this part, including the right to pursue mediation under paragraph 
(d) of this section. If informal resolution under this paragraph or 
mediation under paragraph (d) of this section is not successful in 
resolving the dispute within the time period established under paragraph 
(e)(1) of this section, a formal hearing must be conducted within that 
same time period, unless the parties agree to a specific extension of 
time.

request an impartial review under paragraph (g)(1) of this section if 
the State has established procedures for that review, and a party 
involved in a hearing may bring a civil action under paragraph (i) of 
this section.
    (f) Selection of impartial hearing officers. The impartial hearing 
officer for a particular case must be selected--
    (1) From a list of qualified impartial hearing officers maintained

matter under review;
    (ii) May not overturn or modify the hearing officer's decision, or 
any part of that decision, that supports the position of the applicant 
or eligible individual unless the reviewing official concludes, based on 
clear and convincing evidence, that the decision of the impartial 
hearing officer is clearly erroneous on the basis of being contrary to 
the approved State plan, the Act, Federal vocational rehabilitation 
regulations, or State regulations and policies that are consistent with 
Federal requirements;
    (iii) Makes an independent, final decision following a review of the 
entire hearing record and provides the decision in writing, including a

Sec. 361.60  Matching requirements.

    (a) Federal share--(1) General. Except as provided in paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section, the Federal share for expenditures made by the 
State under the State plan, including expenditures for the provision of 
vocational rehabilitation services and the administration of the State 
plan, is 78.7 percent.
    (2) Construction projects. The Federal share for expenditures made 
for the construction of a facility for community rehabilitation program 
purposes may not be more than 50 percent of the total cost of the 
project.
    (b) Non-Federal share--(1) General. Except as provided in paragraph

    (3) Contributions by private entities. Expenditures made from 
contributions

[[Page 288]]

by private organizations, agencies, or individuals that are deposited in 
the account of the State agency or sole local agency in accordance with 
State law and that are earmarked, under a condition imposed by the 
contributor, may be used as part of the non-Federal share under this 
section if the funds are earmarked for--
    (i) Meeting in whole or in part the State's share for establishing a 
community rehabilitation program or constructing a particular facility 
for community rehabilitation program purposes;
    (ii) Particular geographic areas within the State for any purpose 
under the State plan, other than those described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) 
of this section, in accordance with the following criteria:
    (A) Before funds that are earmarked for a particular geographic area 
may be used as part of the non-Federal share, the State must notify the 
Secretary that the State cannot provide the full non-Federal share 
without using these funds.
    (B) Funds that are earmarked for a particular geographic area may be 
used as part of the non-Federal share without requesting a waiver of 
statewideness under Sec. 361.26.
    (C) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, all 
Federal funds must be used on a statewide basis consistent with Sec. 
361.25, unless a waiver of statewideness is obtained under Sec. 361.26; 
and
    (iii) Any other purpose under the State plan, provided the 
expenditures do not benefit in any way the donor, an individual to whom 
the donor is related by blood or marriage or with whom the donor has a 
close personal relationship, or an individual, entity, or organization 
with whom the donor shares a financial interest. The Secretary does not 
consider a donor's receipt from the State unit of a grant, subgrant, or 
contract with funds allotted under this part to be a benefit for the 
purposes of this paragraph if the grant, subgrant, or contract is 
awarded under the State's regular competitive procedures.

administrative activities permissible under State law. Contributions 
also may be restricted to particular geographic areas to increase 
services or expand the scope of services that are available statewide 
under the State plan in accordance with the requirements in Sec.

<R05>
Sec. 361.61  Limitation on use of funds for construction expenditures.

    No more than 10 percent of a State's allotment for any fiscal year 
under section 110 of the Act may be spent on the construction of 
facilities for community rehabilitation program purposes.

(Authority: Section 101(a)(17)(A) of the Act; 29 U.S.C. 721(a)(17)(A))


<R05>
Sec. 361.62  Maintenance of effort requirements.

    (a) General requirements. (1) The Secretary reduces the amount 
otherwise payable to a State for a fiscal year by the amount by which 
the total expenditures from non-Federal sources under the State plan for 
the previous fiscal year were less than the total of those expenditures 
for the fiscal year 2 years prior to the previous fiscal year.

    Example: For fiscal year 2001, a State's maintenance of effort level 
is based on the amount of its expenditures from non-Federal sources for 
fiscal year 1999. Thus, if the State's non-Federal expenditures in 2001 
are less than they were in 1999, the State has a maintenance of effort 
deficit, and the Secretary reduces the State's allotment in 2002 by the 
amount of that deficit.

    (2) If, at the time the Secretary makes a determination that a State 
has failed to meet its maintenance of effort requirements, it is too 
late for the Secretary to make a reduction in

[[Page 289]]

accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section, then the Secretary 
recovers the amount of the maintenance of effort deficit through audit 
disallowance.
    (b) Specific requirements for construction of facilities. If the 
State provides for the construction of a facility for community 
rehabilitation program purposes, the amount of the State's share of 
expenditures for vocational rehabilitation services under the plan, 
other than for the construction of a facility for community 
rehabilitation program purposes or the establishment of a facility for 
community rehabilitation purposes, must be at least equal to the 
expenditures for those services for the second prior fiscal year. If a 
State fails to meet the requirements of this paragraph, the Secretary 
recovers the amount of the maintenance of effort deficit through audit 
disallowance.
    (c) Separate State agency for vocational rehabilitation services for 
individuals who are blind. If there is a separate part of the State plan 
administered by a separate State agency to provide vocational 
rehabilitation services for individuals who are blind--
    (1) Satisfaction of the maintenance of effort requirements under 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section are determined based on the total 
amount of a State's non-Federal expenditures under both parts of the 
State plan; and
    (2) If a State fails to meet any maintenance of effort requirement, 
the Secretary reduces the amount otherwise payable to the State for that 
fiscal year under each part of the plan in direct relation to the amount 
by which expenditures from non-Federal sources under each part of the 
plan in the previous fiscal year were less than they were for that part 
of the plan for the fiscal year 2 years prior to the previous fiscal 
year.
    (d) Waiver or modification. (1) The Secretary may waive or modify 
the maintenance of effort requirement in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section if the Secretary determines that a waiver or modification is 
necessary to permit the State to respond to exceptional or 
uncontrollable circumstances, such as a major natural disaster or a 
serious economic downturn, that--
    (i) Cause significant unanticipated expenditures or reductions in 
revenue that result in a general reduction of programs within the State; 
or
    (ii) Require the State to make substantial expenditures in the 
vocational rehabilitation program for long-term purposes due to the one-
time costs associated with the construction of a facility for community 
rehabilitation program purposes, the establishment of a facility for 
community rehabilitation program purposes, or the acquisition of 
equipment.
    (2) The Secretary may waive or modify the maintenance of effort 
requirement in paragraph (b) of this section or the 10 percent allotment 
limitation in Sec. 361.61 if the Secretary determines that a waiver or 
modification is necessary to permit the State to respond to exceptional 
or uncontrollable circumstances, such as a major natural disaster, that 
result in significant destruction of existing facilities and require the 
State to make substantial expenditures for the construction of a 
facility for community rehabilitation program purposes or the 
establishment of a facility for community rehabilitation program 
purposes in order to provide vocational rehabilitation services.
    (3) A written request for waiver or modification, including 
supporting justification, must be submitted to the Secretary as soon as 
the State determines that an exceptional or uncontrollable circumstance 
will prevent it from making its required expenditures from non-Federal 
sources.

achieve employment outcomes, payments received from workers' 
compensation funds, fees for services to defray part or all of the costs 
of services provided to particular individuals, and income generated by 
a State-operated community rehabilitation program.
    (c) Use of program income. (1) Except as provided in paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section, program income, whenever earned, must be used 
for the provision of vocational rehabilitation services and the 
administration of the State plan. Program income is considered earned 
when it is received.
    (2) Payments provided to a State from the Social Security 
Administration for assisting Social Security beneficiaries and 
recipients to achieve employment outcomes may also be used to carry out 
programs under part B of Title I of the Act (client assistance), part B 
of Title VI of the Act (supported employment), and Title VII of the Act 
(independent living).
    (3) The State is authorized to treat program income as--
    (i) An addition to the grant funds to be used for additional 
allowable program expenditures, in accordance with 34 CFR 80.25(g)(2); 
or
    (ii) A deduction from total allowable costs, in accordance with 34 
CFR 80.25(g)(1).
    (4) Program income cannot be used to meet the non-Federal share 
requirement under Sec. 361.60.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, any Federal 
funds, including reallotted funds, that are appropriated for a fiscal 
year to carry out a program under this part that are not obligated by 
the State by the beginning of the succeeding fiscal year and any program 
income received during a fiscal year that is not obligated by the State 
by the beginning of the succeeding fiscal year remain available for 
obligation by the State during that succeeding fiscal year.
    (b) Federal funds appropriated for a fiscal year remain available 
for obligation in the succeeding fiscal year only to the extent that the 
State met the matching requirement for those Federal funds by 
obligating, in accordance with 34 CFR 76.707, the non-Federal share in 
the fiscal year for which the funds were appropriated.

<R05>
Sec. 361.65  Allotment and payment of Federal funds for vocational 
rehabilitation services.

    (a) Allotment. (1) The allotment of Federal funds for vocational 
rehabilitation services for each State is computed in accordance with 
the requirements of section 110 of the Act, and payments are made to the 
State on a quarterly basis, unless some other period is established by 
the Secretary.
    (2) If the State plan designates one State agency to administer, or 
supervise the administration of, the part of the plan under which 
vocational rehabilitation services are provided for individuals who are 
blind and another State agency to administer the rest of the plan, the 
division of the State's allotment is a matter for State determination.
    (b) Reallotment. (1) The Secretary determines not later than 45 days 
before the end of a fiscal year which States, if any, will not use their 
full allotment.
    (2) As soon as possible, but not later than the end of the fiscal 
year, the Secretary reallots these funds to other States that can use 
those additional funds during the current or subsequent fiscal year, 
provided the State can meet the matching requirement by obligating the 
non-Federal share of any reallotted funds in the fiscal year for which 
the funds were appropriated.
    (3) Funds reallotted to another State are considered to be an 
increase in the recipient State's allotment for the fiscal year for 
which the funds were appropriated.

    (1) Employment outcomes.
    (i) Performance Indicator 1.1. The number of individuals exiting the 
VR program who achieved an employment outcome during the current 
performance period compared to the number of individuals who exit the VR 
program after achieving an employment outcome during the previous 
performance period.
    (ii) Performance Indicator 1.2. Of all individuals who exit the VR 
program after receiving services, the percentage who are determined to 
have achieved an employment outcome.

individuals who exit the VR program in competitive, self-, or BEP 
employment with earnings levels equivalent to at least the minimum wage 
as a ratio to the State's average hourly earnings for all individuals in 
the State who are employed (as derived from the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics report ``State Average Annual Pay'' for the most recent 
available year).
    (vi) Performance Indicator 1.6. Of all individuals who exit the VR 
program in competitive, self-, or BEP employment with earnings 
equivalent to at least the minimum wage, the difference between the 
percentage who report their own income as the largest single source of 
economic support at the time they exit the VR program and the percentage 
who report their own income as the largest single source of support at 
the time they apply for VR services.

<R05>
Sec. 361.88  Reporting requirements.

    (a) The Secretary requires that each DSU report within 60 days after 
the end of each fiscal year the extent to which the State is in 
compliance with the evaluation standards and performance indicators and 
include in this report the following RSA-911 data:
    (1) The number of individuals who exited the VR program in each 
closure category as specified in the definition of ``Exit the VR 
program'' under Sec. 361.81.
    (2) The number of individuals who exited the VR program in 
competitive, self-, or BEP employment with earnings at or above the 
minimum wage.
    (3) The number of individuals with significant disabilities who 
exited the VR program in competitive, self-, or BEP employment with 
earnings at or above the minimum wage.
    (4) The weekly earnings and hours worked of individuals who exited 
the VR program in competitive, self-, or BEP employment with earnings at 
or above the minimum wage.
    (5) The number of individuals who exited the VR program in 
competitive, self-, or BEP employment with earnings at or above the 
minimum wage whose primary source of support at the time they applied 
for VR services was ``personal income.''
    (6) The number of individuals who exited the VR program in 
competitive, self-, or BEP employment with earnings at or above the 
minimum wage whose primary source of support at closure was ``personal 
income.''
    (7) The number of individuals exiting the VR program who are 
individuals from a minority background.
    (8) The number of non-minority individuals exiting the VR program.
    (9) The number of individuals from a minority background exiting the 
VR program after receiving services under an IPE.
    (10) The number of non-minority individuals exiting the VR program 
after receiving services under an IPE.
    (b) In lieu of the report required in paragraph (a) of this section, 
a DSU may submit its RSA-911 data on tape, diskette, or any alternative 
electronic format that is compatible with RSA's capability to process 
such an alternative, as long as the tape, diskette, or alternative 
electronic format includes the data that--
    (1) Are required by paragraph (a)(1) through (10) of this section; 
and
    (2) Meet the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c) Data reported by a DSU must be valid, accurate, and in a

<R05>
Sec. 361.89  Enforcement procedures.

    (a) If a DSU fails to meet the established performance levels on 
both evaluation standards as required by Sec. 361.82(b), the Secretary 
and the DSU must jointly develop a program improvement plan that 
outlines the specific actions to be taken by the DSU to improve program 
performance.
    (b) In developing the program improvement plan, the Secretary 
considers all available data and information related to the DSU's 
performance.
    (c) When a program improvement plan is in effect, review of the plan 
is conducted on a biannual basis. If necessary, the Secretary may 
request that a DSU make further revisions to the plan to improve 
performance. If the Secretary establishes new performance levels under 
Sec. 361.86(a)(2), the Secretary and the DSU must jointly modify the 
program improvement plan based on the new performance levels. The 
Secretary continues reviews and requests revisions until the DSU 
sustains satisfactory performance based on the current performance 
levels over a period of more than 1 year.
    (d) If the Secretary determines that a DSU with less than 
satisfactory performance has failed to enter into a program improvement 
plan or comply substantially with the terms and conditions of the 
program improvement plan, the Secretary, consistent with the procedures 
specified in Sec. 361.11, reduces or makes no further payments to the 
DSU under this program until the DSU has met one of these two 
requirements or raised its subsequent performance to meet the current 
overall minimum satisfactory level on the compliance indicators.

           Sec. Appendix A to Part 361--Questions and Answers

    The following questions and answers provide a summary of some of the 
most common and critical questions that we received regarding this part 
361 and the applicable responses. As is evident from the responses, we 
maintain that redefining the term ``employment outcome'' for purposes of 
the VR program to mean outcomes that occur in integrated settings will 
promote the provision of opportunities for all VR-eligible individuals 
to pursue the types of jobs that generally are available to the public.

      Is Extended Employment Still a Legitimate Employment Option?

    Yes. Employment in a sheltered setting is a legitimate and valuable 
employment option for individuals with disabilities. Implementation of 
these regulations will not change that fact. Individuals still may 
choose to pursue long-term extended employment outside of the VR 
program, and these regulations ensure that those individuals' needs are 
met by requiring the VR agency to make the necessary referral to local 
extended employment providers.

             Do the Regulations Restrict Individual Choice?

    No. We interpret the concept of individual choice in the Act as a 
choice among the employment outcomes under the VR program specified in 
the statute or by the Secretary in regulations.
    Extended employment (i.e., sheltered or non-integrated employment) 
remains both an initial step toward achieving integrated employment 
under the VR program and a long-term employment option through sources 
of support other than the VR program. In recognizing that some 
individuals with disabilities may wish to work in an extended employment 
setting, these regulations require the VR agency to ensure that these 
individuals are afforded the opportunity to do so by referring them to 
local extended employment providers. Those providers currently support 
the vast majority of sheltered workers through non-VR program resources. 
Moreover, persons wishing to prepare for integrated employment by 
initially working in an extended employment setting also may do so. In 
these cases, the VR agency cannot discontinue VR services until the 
individual transitions to integrated work in the community.

   Can State Agencies Refuse To Serve Those With the Most Significant 
                              Disabilities?

    No. Both the Act and regulations guard against that result. Persons 
with disabilities may not be excluded from the VR program based on an 
assumption or belief that the individual is incapable of working in an 
integrated setting. Rather, State units are required to establish clear 
and convincing evidence that an individual is incapable of achieving an 
employment outcome, for purposes of the VR program, and must conduct

[[Page 295]]

a trial work assessment of the individual's abilities before it can 
refuse services to any individual who it initially believes is incapable 
of working in an intergrated job setting.

 Are Homemaker and Unpaid Family Worker Considered Employment Outcomes 
                     for Purposes of the VR Program?

    Yes. The chief purpose of the regulations is to ensure that 
individuals with disabilities participating in the VR program are able 
to pursue the same type of employment opportunities that are available 
to the general public. Extended employment jobs, unlike homemakers and 
unpaid family workers, are primarily reserved for those with 
disabilities.

      Will the Regulations Serve To Close Down Sheltered Workshops?

    No. Sheltered workshops are primarily supported by other State, 
local, and private resources and rely very little on VR program funds. 
Persons who prefer to work in extended employment on a long-term basis 
are assured access to local extended employment programs through the 
referral requirements in the regulations. Also, those participants in 
the VR program who can best prepare for integrated employment by working 
in an extended employment setting as part of a training and assessment 
program are able to follow that path as well. Thus, extended employment 
programs and sheltered workshops continue to serve essentially the same 
role that they currently serve.

wage, but not less than the customary or usual wage paid by the employer 
for the same or similar work performed by individuals who are not 
disabled.
    (ii) Integrated setting means a setting typically found in the 
community in which an individual with the most severe disabilities 
interacts with non-disabled individuals, other than non-disabled 
individuals who are providing services to that individual, to the same 
extent that non-disabled individuals in comparable positions interact 
with other persons.
    (iii) Supported employment services means on-going support services 
provided by the designated State unit with funds under this part--
    (A) For a period not to exceed 18 months, unless under special 
circumstances a longer period to achieve job stabilization has been

an individual with the most severe disabilities makes the transition to 
extended services; and
    (B) As discrete post-employment services following transition in 
accordance with Sec. 363.4(c)(3);
    (iv) Extended services means on-going support services and other 
appropriate services provided by a State agency, a private nonprofit 
organization, employer, or any other appropriate resource, from funds 
other than funds received under this part, part 381, part 376, or part 
380, after an individual with the most severe disabilities has made the 
transition from State vocational rehabilitation agency support; and
    (v) Transitional employment means a series of temporary job 
placements in competitive work in an integrated work setting with on-
going support services for individuals with the most severe disabilities 
due to mental illness. In transitional employment, the provision of on-
going support services must include continuing sequential job placements 
until job permanency is achieved.
    (3) On-going support services means services that are--
    (i) Needed to support and maintain an individual with the most 
severe disabilities in supported employment;

services providers

[[Page 298]]

throughout the individual's term of employment in a particular job 
placement or multiple placements if those placements are being provided 
under a program of transitional employment. On-going support services 
must include, at a minimum, twice-monthly monitoring at the work site of 
each individual in supported employment to assess employment stability, 
unless under special circumstances, especially at the request of the 
individual, the individualized written rehabilitation program provides 
for off-site monitoring, and, based upon that assessment, the 
coordination or provision of specific services at or away from the work 
site, that are needed to maintain employment stability. If off-site 
monitoring is determined to be appropriate, it must, at a minimum, 
consist of two meetings with the individual and one contact with the 
employer each month. On-going support services consist of--
    (A) Any particularized assessment needed to supplement the 
comprehensive assessment of rehabilitation needs;

Sec. 366.29  When may the Director of the designated State unit (DSU) award grants to centers?

    (a) The Director of the DSU (Director) may award grants under 
section 723 of the Act and this subpart to centers located within the 
State or in a bordering State in a fiscal year if--
    (1) The Director submits to the Secretary and obtains approval of an 
application to award grants for that fiscal year under section 723 of 
the Act and Sec. 366.32 (a) and (b); and
    (2) The Secretary determines that the amount of State funds that 
were earmarked by the State to support the general operation of centers 
meeting the requirements of part C of chapter 1 of title VII of the Act 
in the second fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the 
application is submitted equaled or exceeded the amount of funds 
allotted to the State under section 721 (c) and (d) of the Act (or part 
B of title VII of the Act as in effect on October 28, 1992) for that 
preceding fiscal year.
    (b) For purposes of section 723(a)(1)(A)(iii) of the Act and this 
subpart, the second fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the 
State submits an application to administer the CIL program is considered 
the ``preceding fiscal year.'' Example: If FY 1995 is the fiscal year 
for which the State submits an application to administer the CIL program 
under this subpart, FY 1993 is the ``preceding fiscal year.'' In 
determining the ``preceding fiscal year'' under this subpart, the 
Secretary makes any adjustments necessary to accommodate a State's 
multi-year funding cycle or fiscal year that does not coincide with the

Sec. 366.30  What are earmarked funds?

    (a) For purposes of this subpart, the amount of State funds that

does not include--
    (1) Federal funds used for the general operation of centers;
    (2) State funds used to purchase specific services from a center, 
including State funds used for grants or contracts to procure or 
purchase personal assistance services or particular types of skills 
training;
    (3) State attendant care funds; or
    (4) Social Security Administration reimbursement funds.
    (b) For purposes of this subpart, earmarked funds means funds 
appropriated by the State and expressly or clearly identified as State 
expenditures in the relevant fiscal year for the sole purpose of funding 
the general operation of centers.

<R05>
Sec. 366.31  What happens if the amount of earmarked funds does not equal
or exceed the amount of Federal funds for a preceding fiscal year?

    If the State submits an application to administer the CIL program 
under section 723 of the Act and this subpart for a fiscal year, but did 
not earmark the amount of State funds required by Sec. 366.29(a)(2) in 
the preceding fiscal year, the State shall be ineligible to make grants 
under section 723 of the Act and this subpart after the end of the 
fiscal year succeeding the preceding fiscal year and for each succeeding 
fiscal year.
    Example: A State meets the earmarking requirement in FY 1994. It 
also meets this requirement in FY 1995. However, in reviewing the 
State's application to administer the CIL program in FY 1998, the 
Secretary determines that the State failed to meet the earmarking 
requirement in FY 1996. The State may continue to award grants in FY 
1997 but may not do so in FY 1998 and succeeding fiscal years.

    (b) If the amount of funds earmarked by the State for the general 
operation of centers meets the requirements in Sec. 366.29(a)(1), the 
Secretary approves the application and designates the Director to award 
the grants and carry out section 723 of the Act.
    (c) If the Secretary designates the Director to award grants and

of the Act, the DSU may not add any requirements, terms, or conditions 
to the assistance contract other than those that would be permitted if 
the assistance contract were a grant rather than an assistance contract.

    (g) In the enforcement of any breach of the terms and conditions of 
an assistance contract, the DSU shall follow the procedures established

    (1) 34 CFR part 74 (Administration of Grants to Institutions of 
Higher Education, Hospitals and Nonprofit Organizations) applies to the 
designated agency if the designated agency is not a State agency, local

lawyer or non-lawyer representing an individual in negotiations, 
mediation, or informal administrative proceedings before government 
agencies (whether State, local or Federal), or as in the case of a

    (1) A decision by a designated agency to cancel its existing 
contract with another entity with which it has previously contracted to 
carry out and operate all or part of its responsibilities under the CAP 
(including providing advisory, assistance, or advocacy services to 
eligible clients and client applicants); or
    (2) A decision by a designated agency not to renew its existing 
contract with another entity with which it has previously contracted. 
Therefore, an agency that is carrying out a State's CAP under a contract 
with a designated agency is considered a designated agency for purposes 
of Sec. Sec. 370.10 through 370.17.
    (c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, a designated 
agency that does not renew a contract for CAP services because it is 
following State procurement laws that require contracts to be awarded 
through a competitive bidding process is presumed to have good cause for 
not renewing an existing contract. However, this presumption may be 
rebutted.
    (d) If State procurement laws require a designated agency to award a 
contract through a competitive bidding process, the designated agency 
must hold public hearings on the request for proposal before awarding 
the new contract.

includes, at a minimum--
    (1) The name of the designated agency; and
    (2) An assurance that the designated agency meets the independence 
requirement of section 112(c)(1)(A) of the Act and Sec. 370.2(c), or

112(c)(1)(A) of the Act and Sec. 370.2(d).
    (b)(1) Each State also shall submit to the Secretary an assurance 
that the designated agency has the authority to pursue legal, 
administrative, and other appropriate remedies to ensure the protection 
of the rights of clients or client applicants within the State.
    (2) The authority to pursue remedies described in paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section must include the authority to pursue those remedies 
against the State vocational rehabilitation agency and other appropriate 
State agencies. The designated agency meets this requirement if it has 
the authority to pursue those remedies either on its own behalf or by 
obtaining necessary services, such as legal representation, from outside 
sources.
    (c) Each State also shall submit to the Secretary assurances that--
    (1) All entities conducting, administering, operating, or carrying

  Subpart D_How Does the Secretary Allocate and Reallocate Funds to a 
                                 State?


<R05>
Sec. 370.30  How does the Secretary allocate funds?

    (a) The Secretary allocates the funds available under this part for 
any fiscal year to the States on the basis of the relative population of 
each State. The Secretary allocates at least $50,000 to each State, 
unless the provisions of section 112(e)(1)(D) of the Act (which provides 
for increasing the minimum allotment if the appropriation for the CAP 
exceeds $7,500,000 or the appropriation is increased by a certain 
percentage described in section 112(e)(1)(D)(ii) of the Act) are 
applicable.
    (b) The Secretary allocates $30,000 each, unless the provisions of 
section 112(e)(1)(D) of the Act are applicable, to American Samoa, Guam, 
the Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Republic of 
Palau, except that the Secretary allocates to the Republic of Palau only 
75 percent of this allotment in fiscal year 1996, only 50 percent of 
this allotment in fiscal year 1997, only 25 percent of this allotment in 
fiscal year 1998, and none of this allotment in fiscal year 1999 and 
thereafter.
    (c) Unless prohibited or otherwise provided by State law, 
regulation, or

[[Page 365]]

policy, the Secretary pays to the designated agency, from the State 
allotment under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the amount 
specified in the State's approved request. Because the designated agency 
is the eventual, if not the direct, recipient of the CAP funds, 34 CFR 
parts 74 and 81 apply to the designated agency, whether or not the 
designated agency is the actual recipient of the CAP grant. However, 
because it is the State that submits an application for and receives the 
CAP grant, the State remains the grantee for purposes of 34 CFR parts 76 
and 80. In addition, both the State and the designated agency are 
considered recipients for purposes of 34 CFR part 81.

<R05>
Sec. 370.31  How does the Secretary reallocate funds?

    (a) The Secretary reallocates funds in accordance with section 
112(e)(2) of the Act.

before the end of the fiscal year for which CAP funds were received 
whether the designated agency is making available for reallotment any of 
those CAP funds that it will be unable to obligate in that fiscal year.

    (b) If the designated agency is a private nonprofit organization, 
the designated agency shall apply the cost principles in accordance with 
subpart Q of 34 CFR part 74.
    (c) In addition to those allowable costs established in EDGAR, and 
consistent with the program activities listed in Sec. 370.4, the cost 
of travel in connection with the provision to a client or client 
applicant of assistance under this program is allowable. The cost of 
travel includes the cost of travel for an attendant if the attendant 
must accompany the client or client applicant.
    (d) The State and the designated agency are accountable, both 
jointly and severally, to the Secretary for the proper use of funds made 
available under this part. However, the Secretary may choose to recover 
funds under the procedures in 34 CFR part 81 from either the State or 
the designated agency, or both, depending on the circumstances of each 
case.

    The CAP must be afforded reasonable access to policymaking and 
administrative personnel in State and local rehabilitation programs, 
projects, and community rehabilitation programs. One way in which the 
CAP may be provided that access would be to include the director of the

mediation procedures are used before resorting to formal administrative 
or legal remedies. In designing these procedures, the designated agency 
may take into account its level of resources.
    (b) For purposes of this section, mediation may involve the use of 
professional mediators, other independent third parties mutually agreed 
to by the parties to the dispute, or an employee of the designated 
agency who--
    (1) Is not assigned to advocate for or otherwise represent or is not 
involved with advocating for or otherwise representing the client or 
client applicant who is a party to the mediation; and
    (2) Has not previously advocated for or otherwise represented or

by the designated agency during the succeeding fiscal year in accordance 
with 34 CFR 76.705 through 76.707.
    (b) A designated agency shall inform the Secretary within 90 days

designated agency under this part, including lists of names, addresses, 
photographs, and records of evaluation, must be held strictly 
confidential.
    (b) The designated agency's use of information and records 
concerning individuals must be limited only to purposes directly 
connected with the CAP, including program evaluation activities. Except 
as provided in paragraphs (c) and (e) of this section, this information 
may not be disclosed, directly or indirectly, other than in the 
administration of the CAP, unless the consent of the individual to whom 
the information applies, or his or her parent, legal guardian, or other 
legally authorized representative or advocate (including the 
individual's advocate from the designated agency), has been obtained in 
writing. A designated agency may not produce any report, evaluation, or 
study that reveals any personally identifying information without the 
written consent of the individual or his or her representative.

requesting assistance under the CAP.
    (e) Notwithstanding paragraph (d) of this section and consistent 
with paragraph (f) of this section, a designated agency shall disclose 
to the Secretary, if the Secretary so requests, the identity of, or any 
other personally identifiable information (i.e., name, address, 
telephone number, social security number, or any other official code or 
number by which an individual may be readily identified) related to, any 
individual requesting assistance under the CAP if--
    (1) An audit, evaluation, monitoring review, State plan assurance 
review, or other investigation produces reliable evidence that there is 
probable cause to believe that the designated agency has violated its 
legislative mandate or misused Federal funds; or
    (2) The Secretary determines that this information may reasonably 
lead to further evidence that is directly related to alleged misconduct 
of the designated agency.
    (f) In addition to the protection afforded by paragraph (d) of this 
section, the right of a person or designated agency not to produce 
documents or disclose information to the Secretary is governed by the 
common law of

to achieve the project's goals and objectives, including the time that 
key personnel will commit to the project.
    (5) Budget and cost effectiveness (10 points). The Secretary reviews 
each application to determine the extent to which--
    (i) The budget is adequate to support the project; and
    (ii) Costs are reasonable in relation to the objectives of the 
project.
    (6) Project evaluation (10 points). The Secretary reviews each 
application to determine the quality of the proposed evaluation plan 
with respect to--
    (i) Evaluating project operations and outcomes;
    (ii) Involving the BAC in evaluating the project's job development, 
job placement, career advancement activities, and, to the extent 
included as part of the activities to be carried out by the project, job 
training activities;

<R05>
Sec. 379.53  What are the minimum performance levels for each compliance
indicator?

    (a) Primary compliance indicators--(1) Placement rate. The project 
places individuals it serves into competitive employment as follows:
    (i) No less than 50 percent during fiscal year (FY) 2001.
    (ii) No less than 51 percent during FY 2002.
    (iii) No less than 52 percent during FY 2003.
    (iv) No less than 54 percent during FY 2004.
    (v) No less than 55 percent during FY 2005 and any year thereafter.
    (2) Change in earnings. (i) Except as provided in paragraph 
(a)(2)(ii) of this section, the average earnings of all individuals who 
are placed into competitive employment by the project increase by an 
average of at least $125.00 a week over the average earnings of all 
individuals at the time of project entry.
    (ii) For projects in which at least 75 percent of individuals placed 
into competitive employment are working fewer than 30 hours per week, 
the average earnings of all individuals placed by the project increase 
by an average of at least $100.00 a week over the average earnings of 
all individuals at the time of project entry.
    (b) Secondary compliance indicators--(1) Percent placed who have 
significant disabilities. At least 50 percent of individuals who are 
placed into competitive employment are individuals with significant 
disabilities.
    (2) Percent placed who were previously unemployed. At least 50 
percent of individuals who are placed into competitive employment are 
individuals who were continuously unemployed for at least 6 months at 
the time of project entry.
    (3) Average cost per placement. The actual average cost per 
placement does not exceed 115 percent of the projected average cost per 
placement in the grantee's application.

(Authority: Section 611(f)(1) of the Act; 29 U.S.C. 795(f)(1))


<R05>
Sec. 379.54  What are the reporting requirements for the compliance indicators?

    (a) To receive continuation funding for the third or any subsequent 
year of a PWI grant, each grantee must submit to the Secretary data for 
the most recent complete budget period no later

[[Page 395]]

than 60 days after the end of that budget period, unless the Secretary 
authorizes a later submission date. The Secretary uses this data to 
determine if the grantee has met the program compliance indicators in 
this subpart F.
    (b) A grantee may receive its second year of funding (or the first 
continuation award) under this program before data from the first 
complete budget period is available. However, to allow the Secretary to 
determine whether the grantee is eligible for the third year of funding 
(or the second continuation award), the grantee must submit data from 
the first budget period in accordance with paragraph (a) of this 
section.
    (c) If the data for the most recent complete budget period provided 
under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section show that a grantee has 
failed to achieve the minimum performance levels, as required by Sec. 
379.50(b), the grantee may, at its option, submit data from the first 6 
months of the current budget period. The grantee must submit this data 
no later than 60 days after the end of that 6-month period, unless the 
Secretary authorizes a later submission date. The data must demonstrate 
that the grantee's project performance has improved sufficiently to meet 
the minimum performance levels required in Sec. 379.50(b).

            Sec. Appendix A to Part 379--Evaluation Standards

    Standard 1: The primary objective of the project must be to assist 
individuals with disabilities to obtain competitive employment. The 
activities carried out by the project must support the accomplishment of 
this objective.
    Standard 2: The project must serve individuals with disabilities 
that impair their capacity to obtain competitive employment. In 
selecting persons to receive services, priority must be given to 
individuals with significant disabilities.
    Standard 3: The project must ensure the provision of services that 
will assist in the placement of individuals with disabilities.
    Standard 4: Funds must be used to achieve the project's primary 
objective at minimum cost to the Federal Government.
    Standard 5: The project's advisory council must provide policy 
guidance and assistance in the conduct of the project.
    Standard 6: Working relationships, including partnerships, must be 
established with agencies and organizations to expand the project's 
capacity to meet its objectives.
    Standard 7: The project must obtain positive results in assisting 
individuals with disabilities to obtain competitive employment.


<R05>
         Sec. Appendix B to Part 379--Presumption of Eligibility

    If a DSU determines that an individual is an eligible individual 
under section 102(a) of the Act, including that the individual meets the 
definition of an ``individual with a significant disability,'' and 
refers the individual to a PWI project, the PWI grantee may initiate 
services to that individual without the need for an additional 
determination of eligibility. In these instances, the PWI grantee should 
obtain appropriate documentation of this determination from the DSU.


<R05>
    Sec. Appendix C to Part 379--Calculating Required Matching Amount

    1. The method for calculating the required matching amount may be 
stated by the following formula:

X = (Y / .8) - Y
X = Required Match (provided in cash or through third party in-kind 
contributions)
Y = Amount of Federal Funds

    This equation holds true regardless of the total cost of the 
project. The amount of Federal funds spent in a fiscal year (FY) can 
never be more than 80 percent (hence, the ``.8'' in the formula) of the 
total funds (Federal and non-Federal) spent by the project. Thus, the 
formula is not dependent on knowing the total cost of the project. One 
needs to know only that the Federal share can be no more than 80 percent 
of whatever the total costs may turn out to be. In all cases, the 
matching contribution is calculated by dividing the amount of the 
Federal grant award by 80 percent (.8) and subtracting from that result 
the amount of the Federal grant award.
    For example: If the amount of the Federal PWI grant award is 
$400,000, the amount of the required match is $100,000, calculated as 
follows:

 
                                                                                            (Am't. of Fed. Funds
    Required match      =    (Am't. of Fed. Funds in FY    /   Max. Fed. % of Total)   -           in FY)
 
X                       =   ($400,000...................   /   .8)                     -   400,000

[[Page 396]]

 
X                       =   $500,000-400,000............
X                       =   $100,000....................
 

    The matching contribution is never simply 20 percent of the amount 
of the Federal grant award (i.e., in the above example, NOT 
.2x$400,000).
    2. Another consideration is what happens if a grantee carries over 
unspent Federal funds it received in a fiscal year. If the grantee 
spends or obligates less than the amount of its Federal grant award in a 
particular fiscal year and carries over the unspent or unobligated 
amount of its Federal grant award, its required matching contribution 
stays the same because the amount of its required matching expenditures 
or obligations is based on the amount of Federal dollars received in a 
particular fiscal year. That is, if the grantee carries over any unspent 
or unobligated Federal funds, the grantee must have spent or obligated 
the amount of non-Federal funds required for its matching contribution 
in the same fiscal year in which the Federal funds were received.
    For example: If a PWI grantee receives a grant award of $80,000 in 
FY 2000, its matching requirement for these funds is $20,000. If the 
grantee spends and obligates only $64,000 in FY 2000, it may ``carry 
over'' $16,000 to FY 2001. However, the grantee must spend or obligate 
$20,000 in non-Federal funds in FY 2000 to meet its matching 
requirements for the $80,000 it received in FY 2000, even though it does 
not spend or obligate the entire $80,000 in FY 2000. If the grantee 
fails to spend or obligate in FY 2000 the entire $20,000 in non-Federal 
funds, the grantee will fail to meet the matching requirement for the 
$80,000 it received in FY 2000 and may not carry over the unspent or 
unobligated $16,000 to FY 2001.
    3. The matching contribution also must comply with the requirements 
of 34 CFR 74.23 (for grantees that are institutions of higher education, 
hospitals, or other nonprofit organizations) or 34 CFR 80.24 (for 
grantees that are State, local, or Indian tribal governments). The term 
``third party in-kind contributions'' is defined in either 34 CFR 74.2 
or 34 CFR 80.3, as applicable to the type of grantee.

extended services; and
    (B) As discrete post-employment services following transition in

adequate steps to assure that each vendor understands the provisions of 
the permit and any agreement under which he operates, as evidenced by 
his signed statements:
    (vii) Submit to an arbitration panel those grievances of any vendor 
unresolved after a full evidentiary hearing;
    (viii) Adopt accounting procedures and maintain financial records in 
a manner necessary to provide for each vending facility and for the 
State's vending facility program a classification of financial 
transactions in such detail as is sufficient to enable evaluation of 
performance; and
    (ix) Maintain records and make reports in such form and containing 
such information as the Secretary may require, make such records 
available for audit purposes, and comply with such provisions as the 
Secretary may find necessary to assure the correctness and verification 
of such reports.
    (b) An application submitted under Sec. 395.2 shall be accompanied 
by a copy of State rules and regulations affecting the administration 
and operation of the State's vending facility program.

[[Page 432]]


<R05>
Sec. 395.4  State rules and regulations.

    (a) The State licensing agency shall promulgate rules and 
regulations which have been approved by the Secretary and which shall be 
adequate to assure the effective conduct of the State's vending facility 
program (including State licensing agency procedures covering the 
conduct of full evidentiary hearings) and the operation of each vending 
facility in accordance with this part and with the requirements and 
conditions of each department, agency, and instrumentality in control of 
the maintenance, operation, and protection of Federal property, 
including the conditions contained in permits, as well as in all 
applicable Federal and State laws, local ordinances and regulations.
    (b) Such rules and regulations and amendments thereto shall be filed 
or published in accordance with State law.
    (c) Such rules and regulations shall include provisions adequate to 
insure that the right, title to, and interest in each vending facility 
used in the program and the stock will be vested in accordance with the 
laws of the State in only the following:
    (1) The State licensing agency; or
    (2) Its nominee, subject to the conditions specified in Sec. 
395.15(b); or
    (3) The vendor, in accordance with State determination.
    (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section, 
any right, title to, or interest which existed on June 30, 1955, in 
stock may continue so long as:
    (1) The interest is in the stock of a facility established under the 
program prior to July 1, 1955, and
    (2) The vendor was licensed in the program (whether or not for the 
operation of the vending facility in question) prior to July 1, 1955.


<R05>
Sec. 395.5  Approval of application for designation as State licensing agency.

    When the Secretary determines that an application submitted by a 
State vocational rehabilitation agency under Sec. 395.2, and the 
accompanying rules and regulations indicate a plan of program operations 
which will stimulate and enlarge the economic opportunities for the 
blind, and which will meet all other requirements of this part, he shall 
approve the application and shall designate the applying State 
vocational rehabilitation agency as the State licensing agency.


<R05>
Sec. 395.6  Vendor ownership of vending facilities.

    (a) If a State licensing agency determines under Sec. 395.4(c) that 
the right, title to, and interest in a vending facility may be vested in 
the blind vendor, the State licensing agency shall enter into a written 
agreement with each vendor who is to have such ownership. Such agreement 
shall contain in full the terms and conditions governing such ownership 
in accordance with criteria in the State licensing agency's regulations, 
this part, and the terms and conditions of the permit. The criteria 
established to govern the determination that the title may be so vested 
shall contain reasonable provisions to enable a vendor to purchase 
vending facility equipment and to ensure that no individual will be 
denied the opportunity to become a vendor because of his inability to 
purchase the vending facility equipment or the initial stock;
    (b) The State licensing agency shall establish in writing and 
maintain policies determining whether the vendor-owner or the State 
licensing agency shall be required to maintain the vending facility in 
good repair and in an attractive condition and replace worn-out or 
obsolete equipment; and if the former, such policies shall provide that 
upon such vendor-owner's failure to do so, the State licensing agency 
may make the necessary maintenance, replacement, or repairs and make 
equitable arrangements for reimbursement;
    (c) Where the vendor owns such equipment and is required to maintain 
the vending facility in good repair and in an attractive condition and 
replace worn-out or obsolete equipment, or agrees to purchase additional 
new equipment, service charges for such purposes shall be equitably 
reduced and the method for determining such amount shall be established 
by the State licensing agency in writing;
    (d) Where the vendor owns such equipment, the State licensing agency 
shall retain a first option to repurchase such equipment, and in the 
event the

[[Page 433]]

vendor-owner dies, or for any other reason ceases to be a licensee, or 
transfers to another vending facility, ownership of such equipment shall 
become vested in the State licensing agency for transfer to a successor 
licensee subject to an obligation on its part to pay to such vendor-
owner or his estate, the fair value therein; and
    (e) The vendor-owner, his personal representative or next of kin 
shall be entitled to an opportunity for a full evidentiary hearing with 
respect to the determination of the amount to be paid by the State 
licensing agency for a vendor's ownership in the equipment. When the 
vendor-owner is dissatisfied with any decision rendered as a result of 
such hearing, he may file a complaint with the Secretary under Sec. 
395.13 to request the convening of an ad hoc arbitration panel.


<R05>
Sec. 395.7  The issuance and conditions of licenses.

    (a) The State licensing agency shall establish in writing and 
maintain objective criteria for licensing qualified applicants, 
including a provision for giving preference to blind persons who are in 
need of employment. Such criteria shall also include provisions to 
assure that licenses will be issued only to persons who are determined 
by the State licensing agency to be:
    (1) Blind;
    (2) Citizens of the United States; and
    (3) Certified by the State vocational rehabilitation agency as 
qualified to operate a vending facility.
    (b) The State licensing agency shall provide for the issuance of 
licenses for an indefinite period but subject to suspension or 
termination if, after affording the vendor an opportunity for a full 
evidentiary hearing, the State licensing agency finds that the vending 
facility is not being operated in accordance with its rules and 
regulations, the terms and conditions of the permit, and the terms and 
conditions of the agreement with the vendor.
    (c) The State licensing agency shall further establish in writing 
and maintain policies which have been developed with the active 
participation of the State Committee of Blind Vendors and which govern 
the duties, supervision, transfer, promotion, and financial 
participation of the vendors. The State licensing agency shall also 
establish procedures to assure that such policies have been explained to 
each blind vendor.


<R05>
Sec. 395.8  Distribution and use of income from vending machines on Federal
property.

    (a) Vending machine income from vending machines on Federal property 
which has been disbursed to the State licensing agency by a property 
managing department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States 
under Sec. 395.32 shall accrue to each blind vendor operating a vending 
facility on such Federal property in each State in an amount not to 
exceed the average net income of the total number of blind vendors 
within such State, as determined each fiscal year on the basis of each 
prior year's operation, except that vending machine income shall not 
accrue to any blind vendor in any amount exceeding the average net 
income of the total number of blind vendors in the United States. No 
blind vendor shall receive less vending machine income than he was 
receiving during the calendar year prior to January 1, 1974, as a direct 
result of any limitation imposed on such income under this paragraph. No 
limitation shall be imposed on income from vending machines, combined to 
create a vending facility, when such facility is maintained, serviced, 
or operated by a blind vendor. Vending machine income disbursed by a 
property managing department, agency or instrumentality of the United 
States to a State licensing agency in excess of the amounts eligible to 
accrue to blind vendors in accordance with this paragraph shall be 
retained by the appropriate State licensing agency.
    (b) The State licensing agency shall disburse vending machine income 
to blind vendors within the State on at least a quarterly basis.
    (c) Vending machine income which is retained under paragraph (a) of 
this section by a State licensing agency shall be used by such agency 
for the establishment and maintenance of retirement or pension plans, 
for health insurance contributions, and for the provision of paid sick 
leave and vacation

[[Page 434]]

time for blind vendors in such State, if it is so determined by a 
majority vote of blind vendors licensed by the State licensing agency, 
after such agency has provided to each such vendor information on all 
matters relevant to such purposes. Any vending machine income not 
necessary for such purposes shall be used by the State licensing agency 
for the maintenance and replacement of equipment, the purchase of new 
equipment, management services, and assuring a fair minimum return to 
vendors. Any assessment charged to blind vendors by a State licensing 
agency shall be reduced pro rata in an amount equal to the total of such 
remaining vending machine income.


<R05>
Sec. 395.9  The setting aside of funds by the State licensing agency.

    (a) The State licensing agency shall establish in writing the extent 
to which funds are to be set aside or caused to be set aside from the 
net proceeds of the operation of the vending facilities and, to the 
extent applicable, from vending machine income under Sec. 395.8(c) in 
an amount determined by the Secretary to be reasonable.
    (b) Funds may be set aside under paragraph (a) of this section only 
for the purposes of:
    (1) Maintenance and replacement of equipment;
    (2) The purchase of new equipment;
    (3) Management services;
    (4) Assuring a fair minimum of return to vendors; or
    (5) The establishment and maintenance of retirement or pension 
funds, health insurance contributions, and provision for paid sick leave 
and vacation time, if it is so determined by a majority vote of blind 
vendors licensed by the State licensing agency, after such agency 
provides to each such vendor information on all matters relevant to such 
proposed purposes.
    (c) The State licensing agency shall further set out the method of 
determining the charge for each of the above purposes listed in 
paragraph (b) of this section, which will be determined with the active 
participation of the State Committee of Blind Vendors and which will be 
designed to prevent, so far as is practicable, a greater charge for any 
purpose than is reasonably required for that purpose. The State 
licensing agency shall maintain adequate records to support the 
reasonableness of the charges for each of the purposes listed in this 
section, including any reserves necessary to assure that such purposes 
can be achieved on a consistent basis.


<R05>
Sec. 395.10  The maintenance and replacement of vending facility equipment.

    The State licensing agency shall maintain (or cause to be 
maintained) all vending facility equipment in good repair and in an 
attractive condition and shall replace or cause to be replaced worn-out 
and obsolete equipment as required to ensure the continued successful 
operation of the facility.


<R05>
Sec. 395.11  Training program for blind individuals.

    The State licensing agency shall ensure that effective programs of 
vocational and other training services, including personal and 
vocational adjustment, books, tools, and other training materials, shall 
be provided to blind individuals as vocational rehabilitation services 
under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Pub. L. 93-112), as amended by the 
Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1974 (Pub. L. 93-516). Such programs 
shall include on-the-job training in all aspects of vending facility 
operation for blind persons with the capacity to operate a vending 
facility, and upward mobility training (including further education and 
additional training or retraining for improved work opportunities) for 
all blind licensees. The State licensing agency shall further ensure 
that post-employment services shall be provided to blind vendors as 
vocational rehabilitation services as necessary to assure that the 
maximum vocational potential of such vendors is achieved and suitable 
employment is maintained within the State's vending facility program.


<R05>
Sec. 395.12  Access to program and financial information.

    Each blind vendor under this part shall be provided access to all 
financial data of the State licensing agency relevant to the operation 
of the State vending facility program, including quarterly and annual 
financial reports, provided that such disclosure does not

[[Page 435]]

violate applicable Federal or State laws pertaining to the disclosure of 
confidential information. Insofar as practicable, such data shall be 
made available in braille or recorded tape. At the request of a blind 
vendor State licensing agency staff shall arrange a convenient time to 
assist in the interpretation of such financial data.


<R05>
Sec. 395.13  Evidentiary hearings and arbitration of vendor complaints.

    (a) The State licensing agency shall specify in writing and maintain 
procedures whereby such agency affords an opportunity for a full 
evidentiary hearing to each blind vendor (which procedures shall also 
apply to cases under Sec. 395.6(e)) dissatisfied with any State 
licensing agency action arising from the operation or administration of 
the vending facility program. When such blind vendor is dissatisfied 
with any action taken or decision rendered as a result of such hearing, 
he may file a complaint with the Secretary. Such complaint shall be 
accompanied by all available supporting documents, including a statement 
of the decision which was rendered and the reasons in support thereof.
    (b) The filing of a complaint under paragraph (a) of this section 
with either the State licensing agency or the Secretary shall indicate 
consent by the blind vendor for the release of such information as is 
necessary for the conduct of a full evidentiary hearing or the hearing 
of an ad hoc arbitration panel.
    (c) Upon receipt of a complaint filed by a blind vendor which meets 
the requirements established by the Secretary, the Secretary shall 
convene an ad hoc arbitration panel which shall, in accordance with the 
provisions of 5 U.S.C. chapter 5, subchapter II, give notice, conduct a 
hearing, and render its decision which shall be final and binding on the 
parties except that such decision shall be subject to appeal and review 
as a final agency action for purposes of the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 
chapter 7.
    (d) The arbitration panel convened by the Secretary to hear the 
grievances of blind vendors shall be composed of three members appointed 
as follows:
    (1) One individual designated by the State licensing agency;
    (2) One individual designated by the blind vendor; and
    (3) One individual not employed by the State licensing agency or, 
where appropriate, its parent agency, who shall be jointly designated by 
the other members of the panel and who shall serve as chairman of the 
panel.
    (e) If either the State licensing agency or the blind vendor fails 
to designate a member of an arbitration panel, the Secretary shall 
designate such member on behalf of such party.
    (f) The decisions of an arbitration panel convened by the Secretary 
under this section shall be matters of public record and shall be 
published in the Federal Register.
    (g) The Secretary shall pay all reasonable costs of arbitration 
under this section in accordance with a schedule of fees and expenses 
which shall be published in the Federal Register.
    (h) The provisions of this section shall not require the 
participation of grantors of permits for the operation of vending 
facilities on property other than Federal property.


<R05>
Sec. 395.14  The State Committee of Blind Vendors.

    (a) The State licensing agency shall provide for the biennial 
election of a State Committee of Blind Vendors which, to the extent 
possible, shall be fully representative of all blind vendors in the 
State program on the basis of such factors as geography and vending 
facility type with a goal of providing for proportional representation 
of blind vendors on Federal property and blind vendors on other 
property. Participation by any blind vendor in any election shall not be 
conditioned upon the payment of dues or any other fees.
    (b) The State Committee of Blind Vendors shall:
    (1) Actively participate with the State licensing agency in major 
administrative decisions and policy and program development decisions 
affecting the overall administration of the State's vending facility 
program;

[[Page 436]]

    (2) Receive and transmit to the State licensing agency grievances at 
the request of blind vendors and serve as advocates for such vendors in 
connection with such grievances;
    (3) Actively participate with the State licensing agency in the 
development and administration of a State system for the transfer and 
promotion of blind vendors;
    (4) Actively participate with the State licensing agency in the 
development of training and retraining programs for blind vendors; and
    (5) Sponsor, with the assistance of the State licensing agency, 
meetings and instructional conferences for blind vendors within the 
State.


<R05>
Sec. 395.15  Use of nominee agreements.

    (a) The State licensing agency may enter into an agreement whereby 
another agency or organization undertakes to furnish services to blind 
vendors. Such agreement shall be in writing and shall contain provisions 
which:
    (1) Clearly insure the retention by the State licensing agency of 
full responsibility for the administration and operation of all phases 
of the program;
    (2) Specify the type and extent of the services to be provided under 
such agreement;
    (3) Provide that no set-aside charges will be collected from blind 
vendors except as specified in such agreement;
    (4) Specify that no nominee will be allowed to exercise any function 
with respect to funds for the purchase of new equipment or for assuring 
a fair minimum of return to vendors, except to collect and hold solely 
for disposition in accordance with the order of the State licensing 
agency any charges authorized for those purposes by the licensing 
agency; and
    (5) Specify that only the State licensing agency shall have control 
with respect to selection, placement, transfer, financial participation 
and termination of the vendors, and the preservation, utilization, and 
disposition of program assets.
    (b) If the State licensing agency permits any agency or organization 
other than a vendor to hold any right, title to, or interest in vending 
facilities or stock, the arrangement shall be one permitted by State law 
and shall specify in writing that all such right, title to, or interest 
is held by such agency or organization as the nominee of the State 
licensing agency for program purposes and subject to the paramount right 
of the State licensing agency to direct and control the use, transfer, 
and disposition of such vending facilities or stock.


<R05>
Sec. 395.16  Permit for the establishment of vending facilities.

    Prior to the establishment of each vending facility, other than a 
cafeteria, the State licensing agency shall submit an application for a 
permit setting forth the location, the amount of space necessary for the 
operation of the vending facility; the type of facility and equipment, 
the number, location and type of vending machines and other terms and 
conditions desired to be included in the permit. Such application shall 
be submitted for the approval of the head of the Federal property 
managing department, agency, or instrumentality. When an application is 
not approved, the head of the Federal property managing department, 
agency, or instrumentality shall advise the State licensing agency in 
writing and shall indicate the reasons for the disapproval.


<R05>
Sec. 395.17  Suspension of designation as State licensing agency.

    (a) If the Secretary has reason to believe that, in the 
administration of the program, there is a failure on the part of any 
State licensing agency to comply substantially with the Act and this 
part, he shall so inform such agency in writing, setting forth, in 
detail, the areas in which there is such failure and giving it a 
reasonable opportunity to comply.
    (b) If, after the lapse of a reasonable time, the Secretary is of 
the opinion that such failure to comply still continues and that the 
State licensing agency is not taking the necessary steps to comply, he 
shall offer to such agency, by reasonable notice in writing thereto and 
to the chief executive of the State, an opportunity for a hearing before 
the Secretary (or person designated by the Secretary) to determine 
whether there is a failure on the part of such agency to comply 
substantially

[[Page 437]]

with the provisions of the Act and of this part.
    (c) If it is thereupon determined that there is a failure on the 
part of such agency to comply substantially with the Act and this part, 
appropriate written notice shall be given to such agency and to the 
chief executive of the State suspending such agency's designation as 
licensing agency effective 90 days from the date of such notice. A copy 
of such written notice shall be given to each department, agency, or 
instrumentality of the United States responsible for the maintenance, 
operation, and protection of Federal property on which vending machines 
subject to the requirements of Sec. 395.32 are located in the State. 
Upon the suspension of such designation, vending machine income from 
vending machines on Federal property due for accrual to the State 
licensing agency under Sec. 395.32 shall be retained in escrow by such 
department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States responsible 
for the maintenance, operation and protection of the Federal property on 
which such vending machines are located, pending redesignation of the 
State licensing agency or rescission of the suspension under paragraph 
(e) of this section.
    (d) If, before the expiration of such 90 days, the Secretary (or 
person designated by him) determines that the State licensing agency is 
taking the necessary steps to comply, he may postpone the effective date 
of such suspension for such time as he deems necessary in the best 
interest of the program.
    (e) If, prior to the effective date of such suspension, the 
Secretary (or person designated by him) finds that there is no longer a 
failure on the part of the State licensing agency to comply 
substantially with the provisions of the Act and this part, he shall so 
notify the agency, the chief executive of the State, and each Federal 
department, agency, or instrumentality required to place funds in escrow 
under paragraph (c) of this section, in which event the suspension of 
the designation shall not become effective and the requirement to place 
funds in escrow shall be terminated.

<R05>
Sec. 395.30  The location and operation of vending facilities for blind
vendors on Federal property.

    (a) Each department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States 
in control of the maintenance, operation, and protection of Federal 
property shall take all steps necessary to assure that, wherever 
feasible, in light of appropriate space and potential patronage, one or 
more vending facilities for operation by blind licensees shall be 
located on all Federal property Provided that the location or operation 
of such facility or facilities would not adversely affect the interests 
of the United States. Blind persons licensed by State licensing agencies 
shall be given priority in the operation of vending facilities on any 
Federal property.
    (b) Any limitation on the location or operation of a vending 
facility for blind vendors by a department, agency or instrumentality of 
the United States based on a finding that such location or operation or 
type of location or operation would adversely affect the interests of 
the United States shall be fully justified in writing to the Secretary 
who shall determine whether such limitation is warranted. A 
determination made by the Secretary concerning such limitation shall be 
binding on any department, agency, or instrumentality of the United 
States affected by such determination. The Secretary shall publish such 
determination in the Federal Register along with supporting documents 
directly relating to the determination.
    (c) Priority in the operation of vending facilities in areas 
administered by the National Park Service or the National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration shall be given to blind vendors. Priority in 
the awarding of contracts for the operation of concessions in such areas 
when such concessions provide accommodations, facilities, and services 
of a scope or of a character not generally available in vending 
facilities operated by blind vendors shall be given in accordance with 
the provisions of the Concession Policy Act (Pub. L. 98-249, 16 U.S.C. 
1) or the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, as

[[Page 438]]

amended (Pub. L. 85-568, 42 U.S.C. 2473). The provisions of this part 
shall not apply when all accommodations, facilities, or services in such 
areas are operated by a single responsible concessioner.


<R05>
Sec. 395.31  Acquisition and occupation of Federal property.

    (a) Effective January 2, 1975, no department, agency, or 
instrumentality of the United States shall undertake to acquire by 
ownership, rent, or lease, or to otherwise occupy, in whole or in part, 
any building unless it is determined that such building includes a 
satisfactory site or sites for the location and operation of a vending 
facility by a blind vendor. In those cases where a purchase contract, an 
agreement to lease, or other similar commitment was entered into prior 
to January 2, 1975, the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply.
    (b) Effective January 2, 1975, no department, agency, or 
instrumentality of the United States, shall undertake to occupy, in 
whole or in part, any building which is to be constructed, substantially 
altered, or renovated, or in the case of a building which is occupied on 
January 2, 1975 by a department, agency, or instrumentality of the 
United States, no such department, agency, or instrumentality shall 
undertake to substantially alter or renovate such building, unless it is 
determined that the design for such construction, substantial 
alteration, or renovation includes a satisfactory site or sites for the 
location and operation of a vending facility by a blind vendor. In those 
cases where a design contract or other similar commitment was entered 
into prior to January 2, 1975, the provisions of this paragraph shall 
not apply. For purposes of this paragraph, substantial alteration or 
renovation of a building means a permanent material change in the floor 
area of such building which would render such building appropriate for 
the location and operation of a vending facility by a blind vendor.
    (c) The determination that a building contains a satisfactory site 
or sites under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section shall be made after 
consultation between the State licensing agency and the head of the 
department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States which is 
planning to acquire or otherwise occupy such building. In order to make 
such determination, effective on the publication date of this part each 
such department, agency, or instrumentality shall provide to the 
appropriate State licensing agency written notice of its intention to 
acquire or otherwise occupy such building. Such written notice shall be 
by certified or registered mail with return receipt and shall be 
provided as early as practicable but no later than 60 days prior to such 
intended action. The written notice shall indicate that a satisfactory 
site or sites for the location and operation of a vending facility by 
blind persons is included in the plans for the building to be acquired 
or otherwise occupied and shall further assure that the State licensing 
agency shall be afforded the opportunity to determine whether such 
building includes a satisfactory site or sites for a vending facility. 
The written notice shall further assure that the State licensing agency, 
subject to the approval of the head of the Federal property managing 
department, agency, or instrumentality, shall be offered the opportunity 
to select the location and type of vending facility to be operated by a 
blind vendor prior to the completion of the final space layout of the 
building. The receipt of such written notice shall be acknowledged in 
writing promptly by the State licensing agency but no later than within 
30 days and the State licensing agency shall indicate at that time 
whether it is interested in establishing a vending facility. A copy of 
the written notice to the State licensing agency and the State licensing 
agency's acknowledgement shall be provided to the Secretary.
    (d) When, after a written notice has been provided under paragraph 
(c) of this section, the State licensing agency determines that the 
number of persons using the Federal property is or will be insufficient 
to support a vending facility, and the Secretary concurs with such 
determination, the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section 
shall not apply. The provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section shall also not apply when fewer than 100 Federal Government 
employees are or

[[Page 439]]

will be located during normal working hours in the building to be 
acquired or otherwise occupied or when such building contains less than 
15,000 square feet of interior space to be utilized for Federal 
Government purposes in the case of buildings in which services are to be 
provided to the public.
    (e) The operation of a vending facility established under pre-
existing arrangements shall not be affected by the provisions of this 
section. The provisions of this section shall further not preclude 
future arrangements under which vending facilities to be operated by 
blind vendors may be established in buildings of a size or with an 
employee population less than that specified in paragraph (d) of this 
section: Provided, That both the State licensing agency and the Federal 
property managing department, agency or instrumentality concur in such 
establishment.
    (f) Each department, agency, and instrumentality of the United 
States, when leasing property in privately owned buildings, shall make 
every effort to lease property capable of accommodating a vending 
facility. When, however, such department, agency, or instrumentality is 
leasing part of a privately owned building in which prior to the 
execution of the lease, the lessor or any of his tenants had in 
operation or had entered into a contract for the operation of a 
restaurant or other food facility in a part of the building not included 
in such lease and the operation of a vending facility by a blind vendor 
would be in proximate and substantial direct competition with such 
restaurant or other food facility, the provisions of paragraphs (a), 
(b), and (c) of this section shall not apply.


<R05>
Sec. 395.32  Collection and distribution of vending machine income from
vending machines on Federal property.

    (a) The on-site official responsible for the Federal property of 
each property managing department, agency, or instrumentality of the 
United States, in accordance with established procedures of such 
department, agency, or instrumentality, shall be responsible for the 
collection of, and accounting for, vending machine income from vending 
machines on Federal property under his control and shall otherwise 
ensure compliance with the provisions of this section.
    (b) Effective January 2, 1975, 100 per centum of all vending machine 
income from vending machines on Federal property which are in direct 
competition with a vending facility operated by a blind vendor shall

Sec. 395.33  Operation of cafeterias by blind vendors.

    (a) Priority in the operation of cafeterias by blind vendors on 
Federal property shall be afforded when the Secretary determines, on an 
individual basis, and after consultation with the appropriate property 
managing department, agency, or instrumentality, that such operation can 
be provided at a reasonable cost, with food of a high quality comparable 
to that currently provided employees, whether by contract or otherwise. 
Such operation shall be expected to provide maximum employment 
opportunities to blind vendors to the greatest extent possible.
    (b) In order to establish the ability of blind vendors to operate a 
cafeteria in such a manner as to provide food service at comparable cost 
and of comparable high quality as that available from other providers of 
cafeteria services, the appropriate State licensing agency shall be 
invited to respond to solicitations for offers when a cafeteria contract 
is contemplated by the appropriate property managing department,

[[Page 441]]

agency, or instrumentality. Such solicitations for offers shall 
establish criteria under which all responses will be judged. Such 
criteria may include sanitation practices, personnel, staffing, menu 
pricing and portion sizes, menu variety, budget and accounting 
practices. If the proposal received from the State licensing agency is 
judged to be within a competitive range and has been ranked among those 
proposals which have a reasonable chance of being selected for final 
award, the property managing department, agency, or instrumentality 
shall consult with the Secretary as required under paragraph (a) of this 
section. If the State licensing agency is dissatisfied with an action 
taken relative to its proposal, it may file a complaint with the 
Secretary under the provisions of Sec. 395.37.
    (c) All contracts or other existing arrangements pertaining to the 
operation of cafeterias on Federal property not covered by contract 
with, or by permits issued to, State licensing agencies shall be 
renegotiated subsequent to the effective date of this part on or before 
the expiration of such contracts or other arrangements pursuant to the 
provisions of this section.
    (d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of 
this section, Federal property managing departments, agencies, and 
instrumentalities may afford priority in the operation of cafeterias by 
blind vendors on Federal property through direct negotiations with State 
licensing agencies whenever such department, agency, or instrumentality 
determines, on an individual basis, that such operation can be provided 
at a reasonable cost, with food of a high quality comparable to that 
currently provided employees: Provided, however, That the provisions of 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall apply in the event that the 
negotiations authorized by this paragraph do not result in a contract.


<R05>
Sec. 395.34  Application for permits.

vending facilities and vending machines in an orderly condition at all 
times, and the installation, maintenance, repair, replacement, 
servicing, and removal of vending facility equipment shall be without 
cost to the department, agency, or instrumentality responsible for the 
maintenance of the Federal property; and
    (3) Articles sold at vending facilities operated by blind licensees

be paid by the State licensing agency; and that costs of relocations 
initiated by the department, agency, or instrumentality shall be borne

or instrumentality controlling the Federal property over which the 
dispute arose, who shall be jointly designated by the other members of 
the panel and who shall serve as chairman of the panel.

department, agency, or instrumentality fails to designate a member of an 
arbitration panel, the Secretary shall designate such member on behalf 
of such party.

agency, or instrumentality are in violation of the Act or of this part, 
the head of any such department, agency, or instrumentality (subject to 
any appeal under paragraph (b) of this section) shall

[[Page 443]]

cause such acts or practices to be terminated promptly and shall take 
such other action as may be necessary to carry out the decision of the
