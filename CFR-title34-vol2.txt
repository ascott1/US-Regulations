                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, July 1, 2002, consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

Sec.  300.7  Child with a disability.

    (a) General. (1) As used in this part, the term child with a 
disability means a child evaluated in accordance with Sec. Sec.  
300.530-300.536 as having mental retardation, a hearing impairment 
including deafness, a speech or language impairment, a visual impairment 
including blindness, serious emotional disturbance (hereafter referred 
to as emotional disturbance), an orthopedic impairment, autism, 
traumatic brain injury, an other health impairment, a specific learning 
disability, deaf-blindness, or multiple disabilities, and who, by reason 
thereof, needs special education and related services.
    (2)(i) Subject to paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, if it is 
determined, through an appropriate evaluation under Sec. Sec.  300.530-
300.536, that a child has one of the disabilities identified in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section, but only needs a related service and 
not special education, the child is not a child with a disability under 
this part.
    (ii) If, consistent with Sec.  300.26(a)(2), the related service 
required by the child is considered special education rather than a 
related service under State standards, the child would be determined to 
be a child with a disability under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (b) Children aged 3 through 9 experiencing developmental delays. The 
term child with a disability for children aged 3 through 9 may, at the 
discretion of the State and LEA and in accordance with Sec.  300.313, 
include a child--
    (1) Who is experiencing developmental delays, as defined by the 
State and as measured by appropriate diagnostic instruments and

cognitive development, communication development, social or emotional 
development, or adaptive development; and
    (2) Who, by reason thereof, needs special education and related 
services.
    (c) Definitions of disability terms. The terms used in this 
definition are defined as follows:
    (1)(i) Autism means a developmental disability significantly 
affecting verbal and nonverbal communication and social interaction, 
generally evident before age 3, that adversely affects a child's 
educational performance. Other characteristics often associated with 
autism are engagement in repetitive activities and stereotyped 
movements, resistance to environmental change or change in daily 
routines, and unusual responses to sensory experiences. The term does 
not apply if a child's educational performance is adversely affected 
primarily because the child has an emotional disturbance, as defined in 
paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
    (ii) A child who manifests the characteristics of ``autism'' after 
age 3 could be diagnosed as having ``autism'' if the criteria in 
paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section are satisfied.
    (2) Deaf-blindness means concomitant hearing and visual impairments, 
the combination of which causes such severe communication and other 
developmental and educational needs that

[[Page 13]]

they cannot be accommodated in special education programs solely for 
children with deafness or children with blindness.
    (3) Deafness means a hearing impairment that is so severe that the 
child is impaired in processing linguistic information through hearing, 
with or without amplification, that adversely affects a child's 
educational performance.
    (4) Emotional disturbance is defined as follows:
    (i) The term means a condition exhibiting one or more of the 
following characteristics over a long period of time and to a marked 
degree that adversely affects a child's educational performance:
    (A) An inability to learn that cannot be explained by intellectual, 
sensory, or health factors.
    (B) An inability to build or maintain satisfactory interpersonal 
relationships with peers and teachers.
    (C) Inappropriate types of behavior or feelings under normal 
circumstances.
    (D) A general pervasive mood of unhappiness or depression.
    (E) A tendency to develop physical symptoms or fears associated with 
personal or school problems.
    (ii) The term includes schizophrenia. The term does not apply to 
children who are socially maladjusted, unless it is determined that they 
have an emotional disturbance.
    (5) Hearing impairment means an impairment in hearing, whether 
permanent or fluctuating, that adversely affects a child's educational 
performance but that is not included under the definition of deafness in 
this section.
    (6) Mental retardation means significantly subaverage general 
intellectual functioning, existing concurrently with deficits in 
adaptive behavior and manifested during the developmental period, that 
adversely affects a child's educational performance.
    (7) Multiple disabilities means concomitant impairments (such as 
mental retardation-blindness, mental retardation-orthopedic impairment, 
etc.), the combination of which causes such severe educational needs 
that they cannot be accommodated in special education programs solely 
for one of the impairments. The term does not include deaf-blindness.
    (8) Orthopedic impairment means a severe orthopedic impairment that 
adversely affects a child's educational performance. The term includes 
impairments caused by congenital anomaly (e.g., clubfoot, absence of 
some member, etc.), impairments caused by disease (e.g., poliomyelitis, 
bone tuberculosis, etc.), and impairments from other causes (e.g., 
cerebral palsy, amputations, and fractures or burns that cause 
contractures).
    (9) Other health impairment means having limited strength, vitality 
or alertness, including a heightened alertness to environmental stimuli, 
that results in limited alertness with respect to the educational 
environment, that--
    (i) Is due to chronic or acute health problems such as asthma, 
attention deficit disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, 
diabetes, epilepsy, a heart condition, hemophilia, lead poisoning, 
leukemia, nephritis, rheumatic fever, and sickle cell anemia; and
    (ii) Adversely affects a child's educational performance.
    (10) Specific learning disability is defined as follows:
    (i) General. The term means a disorder in one or more of the basic 
psychological processes involved in understanding or in using language, 
spoken or written, that may manifest itself in an imperfect ability to 
listen, think, speak, read, write, spell, or to do mathematical 
calculations, including conditions such as perceptual disabilities, 
brain injury, minimal brain dysfunction, dyslexia, and developmental 
aphasia.
    (ii) Disorders not included. The term does not include learning 
problems that are primarily the result of visual, hearing, or motor 
disabilities, of mental retardation, of emotional disturbance, or of 
environmental, cultural, or economic disadvantage.
    (11) Speech or language impairment means a communication disorder, 
such as stuttering, impaired articulation, a language impairment, or a 
voice impairment, that adversely affects a child's educational 
performance.
    (12) Traumatic brain injury means an acquired injury to the brain 
caused by an external physical force, resulting in

[[Page 14]]

total or partial functional disability or psychosocial impairment, or 
both, that adversely affects a child's educational performance. The term 
applies to open or closed head injuries resulting in impairments in one 
or more areas, such as cognition; language; memory; attention; 
reasoning; abstract thinking; judgment; problem-solving; sensory, 
perceptual, and motor abilities; psychosocial behavior; physical 
functions; information processing; and speech. The term does not apply 
to brain injuries that are congenital or degenerative, or to brain 
injuries induced by birth trauma.
    (13) Visual impairment including blindness means an impairment in 
vision that, even with correction, adversely affects a child's 
educational performance. The term includes both partial sight and 
blindness.

(1) A public agency may use the Medicaid or other public insurance 
benefits programs in which a child participates to provide or pay for 
services required under this part, as permitted under the public 
insurance program, except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this

claim for services provided pursuant to this part, but pursuant to 
paragraph (g)(2) of this section, may pay the cost that the parent 
otherwise would be required to pay; and
    (iii) May not use a child's benefits under a public insurance 
program if that use would--
    (A) Decrease available lifetime coverage or any other insured 
benefit;
    (B) Result in the family paying for services that would otherwise be 
covered by the public insurance program and that are required for the 
child outside of the time the child is in school;

or
    (D) Risk loss of eligibility for home and community-based waivers,

insurance proceeds only if the parent provides informed consent 
consistent with Sec.  300.500(b)(1).
    (2) Each time the public agency proposes to access the parent's 
private insurance proceeds, it must--
    (i) Obtain parent consent in accordance with paragraph (f)(1) of 
this section; and
    (ii) Inform the parents that their refusal to permit the public 
agency to access their private insurance does not relieve the public 
agency of its responsibility to ensure that all required services are 
provided at no cost to the parents.
    (g) Use of Part B funds. (1) If a public agency is unable to obtain 
parental consent to use the parent's private insurance, or public 
insurance when the parent would incur a cost for a specified service 
required under this part, to ensure FAPE the public agency may use its 
Part B funds to pay for the service.
    (2) To avoid financial cost to parents who otherwise would consent 
to use private insurance, or public insurance if the parent would incur 
a cost, the public agency may use its Part B funds to pay the cost the 
parents otherwise would have to pay to use the parent's insurance (e.g., 
the deductible or co-pay amounts).
    (h) Proceeds from public or private insurance. (1) Proceeds from 
public or private insurance will not be treated as program income for 
purposes of 34 CFR 80.25.
    (2) If a public agency spends reimbursements from Federal funds 
(e.g., Medicaid) for services under this part, those funds will not be 
considered ``State or local'' funds for purposes of the maintenance of 
effort provisions in Sec. Sec.  300.154 and 300.231.

    (a) The State must have on file with the Secretary an assurance 
satisfactory to the Secretary that the funds under Part B of the Act are

information to demonstrate, on either a total or per-capita basis, that 
the State will not reduce the amount of State financial support for 
special education and related services for children with disabilities, 
or otherwise made available because of the excess costs of educating 
those children, below the amount of that support for the preceding 
fiscal year.
    (b) Reduction of funds for failure to maintain support. The 
Secretary reduces the allocation of funds under section 611 of the Act 
for any fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the State fails 
to comply with the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section by the 
same amount by which the State fails to meet the requirement.
    (c) Waivers for exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances. The 
Secretary may waive the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section for 
a State, for one fiscal year at a time, if the Secretary determines 
that--
    (1) Granting a waiver would be equitable due to exceptional or 
uncontrollable circumstances such as a natural disaster or a precipitous 
and unforeseen decline in the financial resources of the State; or
    (2) The State meets the standard in Sec.  300.589 for a waiver of 
the requirement to supplement, and not to supplant, funds received under 
Part B of the Act.
    (d) Subsequent years. If, for any fiscal year, a State fails to meet 
the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section,

[[Page 31]]

including any year for which the State is granted a waiver under 
paragraph (c) of this section, the financial support required of the 
State in future years under paragraph (a) of this section must be the 
amount that would have been required in the absence of that failure and 
not the reduced level of the State's support.

<R05>
Sec.  300.184  Excess cost requirement.

    (a) General. Amounts provided to an LEA under Part B of the Act may 
be used only to pay the excess costs of providing special education and 
related services to children with disabilities.

[[Page 32]]

    (b) Definition. As used in this part, the term excess costs means 
those costs that are in excess of the average annual per-student 
expenditure in an LEA during the preceding school year for an elementary 
or secondary school student, as may be appropriate. Excess costs must be 
computed after deducting--
    (1) Amounts received--
    (i) Under Part B of the Act;
    (ii) Under Part A of title I of the Elementary and Secondary 
Education Act of 1965; or
    (iii) Under Part A of title VII of that Act; and
    (2) Any State or local funds expended for programs that would 
qualify for assistance under any of those parts.
    (c) LLimitation on use of Part B funds. (1) The excess cost 
requirement prevents an LEA from using funds provided under Part B of 
the Act to pay for all of the costs directly attributable to the 
education of a child with a disability, subject to paragraph (c)(2) of 
this section.
    (2) The excess cost requirement does not prevent an LEA from using 
Part B funds to pay for all of the costs directly attributable to the 
education of a child with a disability in any of the ages 3, 4, 5, 18, 
19, 20, or 21, if no local or State funds are available for nondisabled 
children in that age range. However, the LEA must comply with the 
nonsupplanting and other requirements of this part in providing the 
education and services for these children.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1401(7), 1413(a)(2)(A))


<R05>
Sec.  300.185  Meeting the excess cost requirement.

    (a)(1) General. An LEA meets the excess cost requirement if it has 
spent at least a minimum average amount for the education of its 
children with disabilities before funds under Part B of the Act are 
used.
    (2) The amount described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is 
determined using the formula in Sec.  300.184(b). This amount may not 
include capital outlay or debt service.
    (b) Joint establishment of eligibility. If two or more LEAs jointly 
establish eligibility in accordance with Sec.  300.190, the minimum 
average amount is the average of the combined minimum average amounts 
determined under Sec.  300.184 in those agencies for elementary or 
secondary school students, as the case may be.

Sec.  300.190  Joint establishment of eligibility.

    (a) General. An SEA may require an LEA to establish its eligibility 
jointly with another LEA if the SEA determines that the LEA would be 
ineligible under this section because the agency would not be able to 
establish and maintain programs of sufficient size and scope to 
effectively meet the needs of children with disabilities.
    (b) Charter school exception. An SEA may not require a charter 
school that is an LEA to jointly establish its eligibility under 
paragraph (a) of this section unless it is explicitly permitted to do so 
under the State's charter school statute.
    (c) Amount of payments. If an SEA requires the joint establishment 
of eligibility under paragraph (a) of this section, the total amount of 
funds made available to the affected LEAs must be equal to the sum of 
the payments that each LEA would have received under Sec. Sec.  300.711-
300.714 if the agencies were eligible for these payments.

    (a) General. (1) Subject to paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section 
and Sec.  300.311, each State receiving assistance under this part shall 
ensure that FAPE is available to all children with disabilities, aged 3 
through 21, residing in the State, including children with disabilities 
who have been suspended or expelled from school.
    (2) As a part of its obligation under paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section, each State must ensure that the requirements of Sec.  300.125 
(to identify, locate, and evaluate all children with disabilities) are 
implemented by public agencies throughout the State.
    (3)(i) The services provided to the child under this part address 
all of the child's identified special education and related services 
needs described in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (ii) The services and placement needed by each child with a 
disability to receive FAPE must be based on the child's unique needs and 
not on the child's disability.
    (b) Exception for age ranges 3-5 and 18-21. This paragraph provides 
the rules for applying the requirements in paragraph (a) of this section 
to children with disabilities aged 3, 4, 5, 18, 19, 20, and 21 within 
the State:
    (1) If State law or a court order requires the State to provide 
education for children with disabilities in any disability category in 
any of these age groups, the State must make FAPE available to all 
children with disabilities of the same age who have that disability.
    (2) If a public agency provides education to nondisabled children in 
any of these age groups, it must make FAPE available to at least a 
proportionate number of children with disabilities of the same age.
    (3) If a public agency provides education to 50 percent or more of 
its children with disabilities in any disability category in any of 
these age groups, it must make FAPE available to all its children with 
disabilities of the same age who have that disability. This provision 
does not apply to children aged 3 through 5 for any fiscal year for 
which the State receives a grant under section 619(a)(1) of the Act.
    (4) If a public agency provides education to a child with a 
disability in any of these age groups, it must make FAPE available to 
that child and provide that child and his or her parents all of the 
rights under Part B of the Act and this part.
    (5) A State is not required to make FAPE available to a child with a 
disability in one of these age groups if--

[[Page 42]]

    (i) State law expressly prohibits, or does not authorize, the 
expenditure of public funds to provide education to nondisabled children 
in that age group; or
    (ii) The requirement is inconsistent with a court order that governs 
the provision of free public education to children with disabilities in 
that State.
    (c) Children aged 3 through 21 on Indian reservations. With the 
exception of children identified in Sec.  300.715(b) and (c), the SEA 
shall ensure that all of the requirements of Part B of the Act are 
implemented for all children with disabilities aged 3 through 21 on 
reservations.

Sec.  300.301  FAPE--methods and payments.

    (a) Each State may use whatever State, local, Federal, and private 
sources of support are available in the State to meet the requirements 
of this part. For example, if it is necessary to place a child with a 
disability in a residential facility, a State could use joint agreements 
between the agencies involved for sharing the cost of that placement.
    (b) Nothing in this part relieves an insurer or similar third party 
from an otherwise valid obligation to provide or to pay for services 
provided to a child with a disability.
    (c) Consistent with Sec. Sec.  300.342(b)(2) and 300.343(b), the 
State must ensure that there is no delay in implementing a child's IEP, 
including any case in which the payment source for providing or paying 
for special education and related services to the child is being 
determined.

<R05>
Sec.  300.349  Private school placements by public agencies.

    (a) Developing IEPs. (1) Before a public agency places a child with 
a disability in, or refers a child to, a private school or facility, the 
agency shall initiate and conduct a meeting to develop an IEP for the 
child in accordance with Sec. Sec.  300.346 and 300.347.
    (2) The agency shall ensure that a representative of the private 
school or facility attends the meeting. If the representative cannot 
attend, the agency shall use other methods to ensure participation by 
the private school or facility, including individual or conference 
telephone calls.
    (b) Reviewing and revising IEPs. (1) After a child with a disability 
enters a private school or facility, any meetings to review and revise 
the child's IEP may be initiated and conducted by the private school or 
facility at the discretion of the public agency.

disability in accordance with the child's IEP; and
    (2) Make a good faith effort to assist the child to achieve the 
goals and objectives or benchmarks listed in the IEP.
    (b) Accountability. Part B of the Act does not require that any 
agency, teacher, or other person be held accountable if a child does not 
achieve the growth projected in the annual goals and benchmarks or 
objectives. However, the Act does not prohibit a State or public agency 
from establishing its own accountability systems regarding teacher, 
school, or agency performance.
    (c) Construction--parent rights. Nothing in this section limits a 
parent's right to ask for revisions of the child's IEP or to invoke due 
process procedures if the parent feels that the efforts required in 
paragraph (a) of this section are not being made.

<R05>
Sec.  300.403  Placement of children by parents if FAPE is at issue.

    (a) General. This part does not require an LEA to pay for the cost 
of education, including special education and related services, of a 
child with a disability at a private school or facility if that agency 
made FAPE available to the child and the parents elected to place the 
child in a private school or facility. However, the public agency

[[Page 54]]

shall include that child in the population whose needs are addressed 
consistent with Sec. Sec.  300.450-300.462.
    (b) Disagreements about FAPE. Disagreements between a parent and a 
public agency regarding the availability of a program appropriate for 
the child, and the question of financial responsibility, are subject to 
the due process procedures of Sec. Sec.  300.500-300.517.
    (c) Reimbursement for private school placement. If the parents of a 
child with a disability, who previously received special education and 
related services under the authority of a public agency, enroll the 
child in a private preschool, elementary, or secondary school without 
the consent of or referral by the public agency, a court or a hearing 
officer may require the agency to reimburse the parents for the cost of 
that enrollment if the court or hearing officer finds that the agency 
had not made FAPE available to the child in a timely manner prior to 
that enrollment and that the private placement is appropriate. A 
parental placement may be found to be appropriate by a hearing officer 
or a court even if it does not meet the State standards that apply to 
education provided by the SEA and LEAs.
    (d) Limitation on reimbursement. The cost of reimbursement described 
in paragraph (c) of this section may be reduced or denied--
    (1) If--
    (i) At the most recent IEP meeting that the parents attended prior 
to removal of the child from the public school, the parents did not 
inform the IEP team that they were rejecting the placement proposed by 
the public agency to provide FAPE to their child, including stating 
their concerns and their intent to enroll their child in a private 
school at public expense; or
    (ii) At least ten (10) business days (including any holidays that 
occur on a business day) prior to the removal of the child from the 
public school, the parents did not give written notice to the public 
agency of the information described in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this 
section;
    (2) If, prior to the parents' removal of the child from the public 
school, the public agency informed the parents, through the notice 
requirements described in Sec.  300.503(a)(1), of its intent to evaluate 
the child (including a statement of the purpose of the evaluation that 
was appropriate and reasonable), but the parents did not make the child 
available for the evaluation; or
    (3) Upon a judicial finding of unreasonableness with respect to 
actions taken by the parents.
    (e) Exception. Notwithstanding the notice requirement in paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section, the cost of reimbursement may not be reduced or 
denied for failure to provide the notice if--
    (1) The parent is illiterate and cannot write in English;
    (2) Compliance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section would likely 
result in physical or serious emotional harm to the child;
    (3) The school prevented the parent from providing the notice; or
    (4) The parents had not received notice, pursuant to section 615 of 
the Act, of the notice requirement in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

involvement of the parents, if the public agency is unable to obtain the 
parents' participation in the decision. In this case, the public agency 
must have a record of its attempt to ensure their involvement, including 
information that is consistent with the requirements of Sec.  
300.345(d).

Sec.  300.502  Independent educational evaluation.

    (a) General. (1) The parents of a child with a disability have the 
right under this part to obtain an independent educational evaluation of 
the child, subject to paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section.
    (2) Each public agency shall provide to parents, upon request for an 
independent educational evaluation, information about where an 
independent educational evaluation may be obtained, and the agency 
criteria applicable for independent educational evaluations as set forth 
in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (3) For the purposes of this part--
    (i) Independent educational evaluation means an evaluation conducted 
by a qualified examiner who is not employed by the public agency 
responsible for the education of the child in question; and
    (ii) Public expense means that the public agency either pays for the 
full cost of the evaluation or ensures that the evaluation is otherwise 
provided at no cost to the parent, consistent with Sec.  300.301.
    (b) Parent right to evaluation at public expense. (1) A parent has 
the right to an independent educational evaluation at public expense if 
the parent disagrees with an evaluation obtained by the public agency.
    (2) If a parent requests an independent educational evaluation at 
public expense, the public agency must, without unnecessary delay, 
either--
    (i) Initiate a hearing under Sec.  300.507 to show that its 
evaluation is appropriate; or
    (ii) Ensure that an independent educational evaluation is provided 
at public expense, unless the agency demonstrates in a hearing under 
Sec.  300.507 that the evaluation obtained by the parent did not meet 
agency criteria.
    (3) If the public agency initiates a hearing and the final decision 
is that the agency's evaluation is appropriate, the parent still has the 
right to an independent educational evaluation, but not at public 
expense.
    (4) If a parent requests an independent educational evaluation, the 
public agency may ask for the parent's reason why he or she objects to 
the public evaluation. However, the explanation by the parent may not be 
required and the public agency may not unreasonably delay either 
providing the independent educational evaluation at public expense or 
initiating a due process hearing to defend the public evaluation.
    (c) Parent-initiated evaluations. If the parent obtains an 
independent educational evaluation at private expense, the results of 
the evaluation--
    (1) Must be considered by the public agency, if it meets agency 
criteria, in any decision made with respect to the provision of FAPE to 
the child; and
    (2) May be presented as evidence at a hearing under this subpart 
regarding that child.
    (d) Requests for evaluations by hearing officers. If a hearing 
officer requests an independent educational evaluation as part of a 
hearing, the cost of the evaluation must be at public expense.
    (e) Agency criteria. (1) If an independent educational evaluation is 
at public expense, the criteria under which the evaluation is obtained, 
including the location of the evaluation and the qualifications of the 
examiner, must be the same as the criteria that the public agency uses 
when it initiates an evaluation, to the extent those criteria are 
consistent with the parent's right to an independent educational 
evaluation.
    (2) Except for the criteria described in paragraph (e)(1) of this 
section, a public agency may not impose conditions or timelines related 
to obtaining an independent educational evaluation at public expense.

    (i) Conducting an initial evaluation or reevaluation; and
    (ii) Initial provision of special education and related services to 
a child with a disability.

reevaluation; or
    (ii) Administering a test or other evaluation that is administered 
to all children unless, before administration of that test or

child with FAPE.
    (e) Limitation. A public agency may not use a parent's refusal to 
consent to one service or activity under paragraphs (a) and (d) of this 
section to deny the parent or child any other service, benefit, or 
activity of the public agency, except as required by this part.

    (ii) Must not have a personal or professional conflict of interest.
    (2) A person who otherwise qualifies as a mediator is not an

because he or she is paid by the agency to serve as a mediator.
    (d) Meeting to encourage mediation. (1) A public agency may 
establish procedures to require parents who elect not to use the 
mediation process to meet, at a time and location convenient to the 
parents, with a disinterested party--

[[Page 67]]

reasonable attorneys' fees as part of the costs to the parents of a

agency from using funds under Part B of the Act for conducting an action 
or proceeding under section 615 of the Act.
    (c) A court awards reasonable attorney's fees under section 
615(i)(3) of the Act consistent with the following:
    (1) Determination of amount of attorneys' fees. Fees awarded under 
section 615(i)(3) of the Act must be based on rates prevailing in the 
community in which the action or proceeding arose for the kind and 
quality of services furnished. No bonus or multiplier may be used in 
calculating the fees awarded under this subsection.
    (2) Prohibition of attorneys' fees and related costs for certain 
services. (i) Attorneys' fees may not be awarded and related costs may 
not be reimbursed in any action or proceeding under section 615 of the 
Act for services performed subsequent to the time of a written offer of 
settlement to a parent if--
    (A) The offer is made within the time prescribed by Rule 68 of the 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or, in the case of an administrative 
proceeding, at any time more than 10 days before the proceeding begins;
    (B) The offer is not accepted within 10 days; and
    (C) The court or administrative hearing officer finds that the 
relief finally obtained by the parents is not more favorable to the 
parents than the offer of settlement.

the IEP team unless the meeting is convened as a result of an 
administrative proceeding or judicial action, or at the discretion of 
the State, for a mediation described in Sec.  300.506 that is conducted 
prior to the filing of a request for due process under Sec. Sec.  
300.507 or 300.520-300.528.
    (3) Exception to prohibition on attorneys' fees and related costs. 
Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(2) of this section, an award of attorneys' 
fees and related costs may be made to a parent who is the prevailing 
party and who was substantially justified in rejecting the settlement 
offer.
    (4) Reduction of amount of attorneys' fees. Except as provided in 
paragraph (c)(5) of this section, the court reduces, accordingly, the 
amount of the attorneys' fees awarded under section 615 of the Act, if 
the court finds that--
    (i) The parent, during the course of the action or proceeding, 
unreasonably protracted the final resolution of the controversy;
    (ii) The amount of the attorneys' fees otherwise authorized to be 
awarded unreasonably exceeds the hourly rate prevailing in the community 
for similar services by attorneys of reasonably comparable skill, 
reputation, and experience;
    (iii) The time spent and legal services furnished were excessive 
considering the nature of the action or proceeding; or
    (iv) The attorney representing the parent did not provide to the 
school district the appropriate information in the due process complaint 
in accordance with Sec.  300.507(c).
    (5) Exception to reduction in amount of attorneys' fees. The 
provisions of paragraph (c)(4) of this section do not apply in any

or there was a violation of section 615 of the Act.

appropriate, that placement must be treated as an agreement between the 
State or local agency and the parents for purposes of paragraph (a) of

    (2) The public agency, after reasonable efforts, cannot discover the 
whereabouts of a parent; or
    (3) The child is a ward of the State under the laws of that State.
    (b) Duty of public agency. The duty of a public agency under 
paragraph (a) of this section includes the assignment of an individual 
to act as a surrogate for the parents. This must include a method--
    (1) For determining whether a child needs a surrogate parent; and
    (2) For assigning a surrogate parent to the child.
    (c) Criteria for selection of surrogates. (1) The public agency may 
select a surrogate parent in any way permitted under State law.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, public 
agencies shall ensure that a person selected as a surrogate--
    (i) Is not an employee of the SEA, the LEA, or any other agency that 
is involved in the education or care of the child;
    (ii) Has no interest that conflicts with the interest of the child 
he or she represents; and

of the child.
    (3) A public agency may select as a surrogate a person who is an 
employee of a nonpublic agency that only provides non-educational care 
for the child and who meets the standards in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii) and 
(iii) of this section.
    (d) Non-employee requirement; compensation. A person who otherwise 
qualifies to be a surrogate parent under paragraph (c) of this section 
is not an employee of the agency solely because he or she is paid by the 
agency to serve as a surrogate parent.
    (e) Responsibilities. The surrogate parent may represent the child 
in all matters relating to--
    (1) The identification, evaluation, and educational placement of the

    (1)(i) The public agency shall provide any notice required by this 
part to both the individual and the parents; and
    (ii) All other rights accorded to parents under Part B of the Act 
transfer to the student; and
    (2) All rights accorded to parents under Part B of the Act transfer 
to students who are incarcerated in an adult or juvenile, State or local

    (3) Whenever a State transfers rights under this part pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, the agency shall notify the 
individual and the parents of the transfer of rights.
    (b) Special rule. If, under State law, a State has a mechanism to 
determine that a student with a disability, who has reached the age of 
majority under State law that applies to all children and has not been 
determined incompetent under State law, does not have the ability to 
provide informed consent with respect to his or her educational program, 
the State shall establish procedures for appointing the parent, or, if

[[Page 69]]

the parent is not available another appropriate individual, to represent 
the educational interests of the student throughout the student's 
eligibility under Part B of the Act.

    (a) School personnel may order--
    (1)(i) To the extent removal would be applied to children without 
disabilities, the removal of a child with a disability from the child's 
current placement for not more than 10 consecutive school days for any 
violation of school rules, and additional removals of not more than 10 
consecutive school days in that same school year for separate incidents 
of misconduct (as long as those removals do not constitute a change of 
placement under Sec.  300.519(b));
    (ii) After a child with a disability has been removed from his or 
her current placement for more than 10 school days in the same school 
year, during any subsequent days of removal the public agency must 
provide services to the extent required under Sec.  300.121(d); and
    (2) A change in placement of a child with a disability to an 
appropriate interim alternative educational setting for the same amount 
of time that a child without a disability would be subject to 
discipline, but for not more than 45 days, if--
    (i) The child carries a weapon to school or to a school function 
under the jurisdiction of a State or a local educational agency; or
    (ii) The child knowingly possesses or uses illegal drugs or sells or 
solicits the sale of a controlled substance while at school or a school 
function under the jurisdiction of a State or local educational agency.

first removing the child for more than 10 school days in a school year 
or commencing a removal that constitutes a change of placement under 
Sec.  300.519, including the action described in paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section--
    (i) If the LEA did not conduct a functional behavioral assessment 
and implement a behavioral intervention plan for the child before the 
behavior that resulted in the removal described in paragraph (a) of this 
section, the agency shall convene an IEP meeting to develop an 
assessment plan.
    (ii) If the child already has a behavioral intervention plan, the 
IEP team shall meet to review the plan and its implementation, and, 
modify the plan and its implementation as necessary, to address the 
behavior.
    (2) As soon as practicable after developing the plan described in 
paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, and completing the assessments 
required by the plan, the LEA shall convene an IEP meeting to develop 
appropriate behavioral interventions to address that behavior and shall 
implement those interventions.
    (c)(1) If subsequently, a child with a disability who has a 
behavioral intervention plan and who has been removed from the child's 
current educational placement for more than 10 school days in a school 
year is subjected to a removal that does not constitute a change of 
placement under Sec.  300.519, the IEP team members shall review the 
behavioral intervention plan and its implementation to determine if 
modifications are necessary.
    (2) If one or more of the team members believe that modifications 
are needed, the team shall meet to modify the plan and its 
implementation, to the extent the team determines necessary.

the child's IEP and placement were appropriate and the special education 
services, supplementary aids and services, and behavior intervention 
strategies were provided consistent with the child's IEP and placement;
    (ii) The child's disability did not impair the ability of the child 
to understand the impact and consequences of the behavior subject to 
disciplinary action; and
    (iii) The child's disability did not impair the ability of the child 
to control the behavior subject to disciplinary action.
    (d) Decision. If the IEP team and other qualified personnel 
determine that any of the standards in paragraph (c)(2) of this section 
were not met, the behavior must be considered a manifestation of the 
child's disability.
    (e) Meeting. The review described in paragraph (a) of this section 
may be conducted at the same IEP meeting that is convened under Sec.  
300.520(b).

    (a) General. If the result of the review described in Sec.  300.523 
is a determination, consistent with Sec.  300.523(d), that the behavior 
of the child with a disability was not a manifestation of the child's 
disability, the relevant disciplinary procedures applicable to children 
without disabilities may be applied to the child in the same manner in 
which they would be applied to children without disabilities, except as 
provided in Sec.  300.121(d).
    (b) Additional requirement. If the public agency initiates 
disciplinary procedures applicable to all children, the agency shall 
ensure that the special education and disciplinary records of the child 
with a disability are transmitted for consideration by the person or 
persons making the final determination regarding the disciplinary 
action.

after expiration of the interim alternative placement, during the 
pendency of any proceeding to challenge the proposed change in placement 
the child must remain in the current placement (the child's placement 
prior to the interim alternative educational setting), except as 
provided in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c) Expedited hearing. (1) If school personnel maintain that it is 
dangerous for the child to be in the current placement (placement prior 
to removal to the interim alternative education setting) during the 
pendency of the due process proceedings, the LEA may request an 
expedited due process hearing.
    (2) In determining whether the child may be placed in the 
alternative educational setting or in another appropriate placement

Sec.  300.527  Protections for children not yet eligible for special education and related services.

    (a) General. A child who has not been determined to be eligible for 
special education and related services under this part and who has 
engaged in behavior that violated any rule or code of conduct of the 
local educational agency, including any behavior described in Sec. Sec.  
300.520 or 300.521, may assert any of the protections provided for in 
this part if the LEA had knowledge (as determined in accordance with 
paragraph (b) of this section) that the child was a child with a 
disability before the behavior that precipitated the disciplinary action 
occurred.
    (b) Basis of knowledge. An LEA must be deemed to have knowledge that 
a child is a child with a disability if--
    (1) The parent of the child has expressed concern in writing (or 
orally if the parent does not know how to write or has a disability that 
prevents a written statement) to personnel of the appropriate 
educational agency that the child is in need of special education and 
related services;
    (2) The behavior or performance of the child demonstrates the need 
for these services, in accordance with Sec.  300.7;
    (3) The parent of the child has requested an evaluation of the child 
pursuant to Sec. Sec.  300.530-300.536; or
    (4) The teacher of the child, or other personnel of the local 
educational agency, has expressed concern about the behavior or 
performance of the child to the director of special education of the 
agency or to other personnel in accordance with the agency's established 
child find or special education referral system.
    (c) Exception. A public agency would not be deemed to have knowledge 
under paragraph (b) of this section if, as a result of receiving the 
information specified in that paragraph, the agency--
    (1) Either--
    (i) Conducted an evaluation under Sec. Sec.  300.530-300.536, and 
determined that the child was not a child with a disability under this 
part; or
    (ii) Determined that an evaluation was not necessary; and
    (2) Provided notice to the child's parents of its determination 
under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, consistent with Sec.  300.503.
    (d) Conditions that apply if no basis of knowledge. (1) General. If 
an LEA does not have knowledge that a child is a child with a disability 
(in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section) prior to 
taking disciplinary measures against the child, the child may be 
subjected to the same disciplinary measures as measures applied to 
children without disabilities who engaged in comparable behaviors 
consistent with paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

[[Page 73]]

    (2) Limitations. (i) If a request is made for an evaluation of a 
child during the time period in which the child is subjected to 
disciplinary measures under Sec.  300.520 or 300.521, the evaluation 
must be conducted in an expedited manner.
    (ii) Until the evaluation is completed, the child remains in the 
educational placement determined by school authorities, which can 
include suspension or expulsion without educational services.
    (iii) If the child is determined to be a child with a disability, 
taking into consideration information from the evaluation conducted by 
the agency and information provided by the parents, the agency shall 
provide special education and related services in accordance with the 
provisions of this part, including the requirements of Sec. Sec.  
300.520-300.529 and section 612(a)(1)(A) of the Act.

must be the same for hearings requested by parents or public agencies.
    (c) A State may establish different procedural rules for expedited 
hearings under Sec. Sec.  300.521-300.526 than it has established for 
due process hearings under Sec.  300.507.

committed by a child with a disability to appropriate authorities or to 
prevent State law enforcement and judicial authorities from exercising 
their responsibilities with regard to the application of Federal and 
State law to crimes committed by a child with a disability.
    (b)(1) An agency reporting a crime committed by a child with a 
disability shall ensure that copies of the special education and 
disciplinary records of the child are transmitted for consideration by 
the appropriate authorities to whom it reports the crime.
    (2) An agency reporting a crime under this section may transmit 
copies of the child's special education and disciplinary records only to

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1414(b)(3); 1412(a)(7))


<R05>
Sec.  300.531  Initial evaluation.

    Each public agency shall conduct a full and individual initial 
evaluation, in accordance with Sec. Sec.  300.532 and 300.533, before 
the initial provision of special education and related services to a 
child with a disability under Part B of the Act.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1414(a)(1))


<R05>
Sec.  300.532  Evaluation procedures.

    Each public agency shall ensure, at a minimum, that the following 
requirements are met:
    (a)(1) Tests and other evaluation materials used to assess a child 
under Part B of the Act--
    (i) Are selected and administered so as not to be discriminatory on 
a racial or cultural basis; and

[[Page 74]]

    (ii) Are provided and administered in the child's native language or 
other mode of communication, unless it is clearly not feasible to do so; 
and
    (2) Materials and procedures used to assess a child with limited 
English proficiency are selected and administered to ensure that they 
measure the extent to which the child has a disability and needs special 
education, rather than measuring the child's English language skills.
    (b) A variety of assessment tools and strategies are used to gather 
relevant functional and developmental information about the child, 
including information provided by the parent, and information related to 
enabling the child to be involved in and progress in the general 
curriculum (or for a preschool child, to participate in appropriate 
activities), that may assist in determining--
    (1) Whether the child is a child with a disability under Sec.  
300.7; and
    (2) The content of the child's IEP.
    (c)(1) Any standardized tests that are given to a child--
    (i) Have been validated for the specific purpose for which they are 
used; and
    (ii) Are administered by trained and knowledgeable personnel in 
accordance with any instructions provided by the producer of the tests.
    (2) If an assessment is not conducted under standard conditions, a 
description of the extent to which it varied from standard conditions 
(e.g., the qualifications of the person administering the test, or the 
method of test administration) must be included in the evaluation 
report.
    (d) Tests and other evaluation materials include those tailored to 
assess specific areas of educational need and not merely those that are 
designed to provide a single general intelligence quotient.
    (e) Tests are selected and administered so as best to ensure that if 
a test is administered to a child with impaired sensory, manual, or 
speaking skills, the test results accurately reflect the child's 
aptitude or achievement level or whatever other factors the test 
purports to measure, rather than reflecting the child's impaired 
sensory, manual, or speaking skills (unless those skills are the factors 
that the test purports to measure).
    (f) No single procedure is used as the sole criterion for 
determining whether a child is a child with a disability and for 
determining an appropriate educational program for the child.
    (g) The child is assessed in all areas related to the suspected 
disability, including, if appropriate, health, vision, hearing, social 
and emotional status, general intelligence, academic performance, 
communicative status, and motor abilities.
    (h) In evaluating each child with a disability under Sec. Sec.  
300.531-300.536, the evaluation is sufficiently comprehensive to 
identify all of the child's special education and related services 
needs, whether or not commonly linked to the disability category in 
which the child has been classified.
    (i) The public agency uses technically sound instruments that may 
assess the relative contribution of cognitive and behavioral factors, in 
addition to physical or developmental factors.
    (j) The public agency uses assessment tools and strategies that 
provide relevant information that directly assists persons in 
determining the educational needs of the child.

300.344, and other qualified professionals, as appropriate, shall--
    (1) Review existing evaluation data on the child, including--
    (i) Evaluations and information provided by the parents of the 
child;
    (ii) Current classroom-based assessments and observations; and
    (iii) Observations by teachers and related services providers; and
    (2) On the basis of that review, and input from the child's parents, 
identify what additional data, if any, are needed to determine--
    (i) Whether the child has a particular category of disability, as 
described in

[[Page 75]]

Sec.  300.7, or, in case of a reevaluation of a child, whether the child 
continues to have such a disability;
    (ii) The present levels of performance and educational needs of the 
child;
    (iii) Whether the child needs special education and related 
services, or in the case of a reevaluation of a child, whether the child 
continues to need special education and related services; and
    (iv) Whether any additions or modifications to the special education 
and related services are needed to enable the child to meet the 
measurable annual goals set out in the IEP of the child and to 
participate, as appropriate, in the general curriculum.
    (b) Conduct of review. The group described in paragraph (a) of this 
section may conduct its review without a meeting.
    (c) Need for additional data. The public agency shall administer 
tests and other evaluation materials as may be needed to produce the 
data identified under paragraph (a) of this section.
    (d) Requirements if additional data are not needed. (1) If the 
determination under paragraph (a) of this section is that no additional 
data are needed to determine whether the child continues to be a child 
with a disability, the public agency shall notify the child's parents--
    (i) Of that determination and the reasons for it; and
    (ii) Of the right of the parents to request an assessment to 
determine whether, for purposes of services under this part, the child 
continues to be a child with a disability.
    (2) The public agency is not required to conduct the assessment 
described in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section unless requested to do 
so by the child's parents.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1416(b))


<R05>
Sec.  300.587  Enforcement.

    (a) General. The Secretary initiates an action described in 
paragraph (b) of this section if the Secretary finds--
    (1) That there has been a failure by the State to comply 
substantially with any provision of Part B of the Act, this part, or 34 
CFR part 301; or
    (2) That there is a failure to comply with any condition of an LEA's 
or SEA's eligibility under Part B of the Act, this part or 34 CFR part 
301, including the terms of any agreement to achieve compliance with 
Part B of the Act, this part, or Part 301 within the timelines specified 
in the agreement.
    (b) Types of action. The Secretary, after notifying the SEA (and any 
LEA or State agency affected by a failure described in paragraph (a)(2) 
of this section)--
    (1) Withholds in whole or in part any further payments to the State 
under Part B of the Act;
    (2) Refers the matter to the Department of Justice for enforcement; 
or
    (3) Takes any other enforcement action authorized by law.
    (c) Nature of withholding. (1) If the Secretary determines that it 
is appropriate to withhold further payments under paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section, the Secretary may determine that the withholding will be 
limited to programs or projects, or portions thereof, affected by the 
failure, or that the SEA shall not make further payments under Part B of 
the Act to specified LEA or State agencies affected by the failure.
    (2) Until the Secretary is satisfied that there is no longer any 
failure to comply with the provisions of Part B of the Act, this part, 
or 34 CFR part 301, as specified in paragraph (a) of this section, 
payments to the State under Part B of the Act are withheld in whole or 
in part, or payments by the SEA under Part B of the Act are limited to 
local educational agencies and State agencies whose actions did not 
cause or were not involved in the failure, as the case may be.
    (3) Any SEA, LEA, or other State agency that has received notice 
under paragraph (a) of this section shall, by means of a public notice, 
take such measures as may be necessary to bring the pendency of an 
action pursuant to this subsection to the attention of the public within 
the jurisdiction of that agency.
    (4) Before withholding under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the 
Secretary provides notice and a hearing pursuant to the procedures in 
Sec. Sec.  300.581-300.586.
    (d) Referral for appropriate enforcement. (1) Before the Secretary 
makes a referral under paragraph (b)(2) of this section for enforcement, 
or takes any other enforcement action authorized by law under paragraph 
(b)(3), the Secretary provides the State--
    (i) With reasonable notice; and

[[Page 85]]

    (ii) With an opportunity for a hearing.
    (2) The hearing described in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section 
consists of an opportunity to meet with the Assistant Secretary for the 
Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services to demonstrate 
why the Department should not make a referral for enforcement.
    (e) Divided State agency responsibility. For purposes of this part, 
if responsibility for ensuring that the requirements of this part are 
met with respect to children with disabilities who are convicted as 
adults under State law and incarcerated in adult prisons is assigned to 
a public agency other than the SEA pursuant to Sec.  300.600(d), and if 
the Secretary finds that the failure to comply substantially with the 
provisions of Part B of the Act or this part are related to a failure by 
the public agency, the Secretary takes one of the enforcement actions 
described in paragraph (b) of this section to ensure compliance with 
Part B of the Act and this part, except--
    (1) Any reduction or withholding of payments to the State under 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section is proportionate to the total funds 
allotted under section 611 of the Act to the State as the number of 
eligible children with disabilities in adult prisons under the 
supervision of the other public agency is proportionate to the number of 
eligible individuals with disabilities in the State under the 
supervision of the State educational agency; and
    (2) Any withholding of funds under paragraph (e)(1) of this section 
is limited to the specific agency responsible for the failure to comply 
with Part B of the Act or this part.

<R05>
Sec.  300.588  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec.  300.589  Waiver of requirement regarding supplementing and not supplanting with Part B funds.

    (a) Except as provided under Sec. Sec.  300.232-300.235, funds paid 
to a State under Part B of the Act must be used to supplement and 
increase the level of Federal, State, and local funds (including funds 
that are not under the direct control of SEAs or LEAs) expended for 
special education and related services provided to children with 
disabilities under Part B of the Act and in no case to supplant those 
Federal, State, and local funds. A State may use funds it retains under 
Sec.  300.602 without regard to the prohibition on supplanting other 
funds (see Sec.  300.372).
    (b) If a State provides clear and convincing evidence that all 
eligible children with disabilities throughout the State have FAPE 
available to them, the Secretary may waive for a period of one year in 
whole or in part the requirement under Sec.  300.153 (regarding State-
level nonsupplanting) if the Secretary concurs with the evidence 
provided by the State.
    (c) If a State wishes to request a waiver under this section, it 
must submit to the Secretary a written request that includes--
    (1) An assurance that FAPE is currently available, and will remain 
available throughout the period that a waiver would be in effect, to all 
eligible children with disabilities throughout the State, regardless of 
the public agency that is responsible for providing FAPE to them. The 
assurance must be signed by an official who has the authority to provide 
that assurance as it applies to all eligible children with disabilities 
in the State;
    (2) All evidence that the State wishes the Secretary to consider in 
determining whether all eligible children with disabilities have FAPE 
available to them, setting forth in detail--
    (i) The basis on which the State has concluded that FAPE is 
available to all eligible children in the State; and
    (ii) The procedures that the State will implement to ensure that 
FAPE remains available to all eligible children in the State, which must 
include--
    (A) The State's procedures under Sec.  300.125 for ensuring that all 
eligible children are identified, located and evaluated;
    (B) The State's procedures for monitoring public agencies to ensure 
that they comply with all requirements of this part;
    (C) The State's complaint procedures under Sec. Sec.  300.660-
300.662; and

[[Page 86]]

    (D) The State's hearing procedures under Sec. Sec.  300.507-300.511 
and 300.520-300.528;
    (3) A summary of all State and Federal monitoring reports, and State 
complaint decisions (see Sec. Sec.  300.660-300.662) and hearing 
decisions (see Sec. Sec.  300.507-300.511 and 300.520-300.528), issued 
within three years prior to the date of the State's request for a waiver 
under this section, that includes any finding that FAPE has not been 
available to one or more eligible children, and evidence that FAPE is 
now available to all children addressed in those reports or decisions; 
and
    (4) Evidence that the State, in determining that FAPE is currently 
available to all eligible children with disabilities in the State, has 
consulted with the State advisory panel under Sec.  300.650, the State's 
parent training and information center or centers, the State's 
protection and advocacy organization, and other organizations 
representing the interests of children with disabilities and their 
parents, and a summary of the input of these organizations.
    (d) If the Secretary determines that the request and supporting 
evidence submitted by the State makes a prima facie showing that FAPE 
is, and will remain, available to all eligible children with 
disabilities in the State, the Secretary, after notice to the public 
throughout the State, conducts a public hearing at which all interested 
persons and organizations may present evidence regarding the following 
issues:
    (1) Whether FAPE is currently available to all eligible children 
with disabilities in the State.
    (2) Whether the State will be able to ensure that FAPE remains 
available to all eligible children with disabilities in the State if the 
Secretary provides the requested waiver.
    (e) Following the hearing, the Secretary, based on all submitted 
evidence, will provide a waiver, in whole or in part, for a period of 
one year if the Secretary finds that the State has provided clear and 
convincing evidence that FAPE is currently available to all eligible 
children with disabilities in the State, and the State will be able to 
ensure that FAPE remains available to all eligible children with 
disabilities in the State if the Secretary provides the requested 
waiver.
    (f) A State may receive a waiver of the requirement of section 
612(a)(19)(A) and Sec.  300.154(a) if it satisfies the requirements of 
paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section.
    (g) The Secretary may grant subsequent waivers for a period of one 
year each, if the Secretary determines that the State has provided clear 
and convincing evidence that all eligible children with disabilities 
throughout the State have, and will continue to have throughout the one-
year period of the waiver, FAPE available to them.

      Individualized Education Programs (IEPS) and Other Selected 
                          ImplementatioN Issues

    Interpretation of IEP and Other selected Requirements under Part B 
of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA; [chyph]Part B)

                              Introduction

    The IEP requirements under Part B of the IDEA emphasize the 
importance of three core concepts: (1) the involvement and progress of 
each child with a disability in the general curriculum including 
addressing the unique needs that arise out of the child's disability; 
(2) the involvement of parents and students, together with regular and 
special education personnel, in making individual decisions to support 
each student's (child's) educational success, and (3) the preparation of 
students with disabilities for employment and other post-school 
activities.
    The first three sections of this Appendix (I-III) provide guidance 
regarding the IEP requirements as they relate to the three core concepts 
described above. Section IV addresses other questions regarding the 
development and content of IEPs, including questions about the timelines 
and responsibility for developing and implementing IEPs, participation 
in IEP meetings, and IEP content. Section IV also addresses questions on 
other selected requirements under IDEA.

   I. Involvement and Progress of Each Child With a Disability in the 
                           General Curriculum

    In enacting the IDEA Amendments of 1997, the Congress found that 
research, demonstration, and practice over the past 20 years in special 
education and related disciplines have demonstrated that an effective 
educational system now and in the future must maintain high academic 
standards and clear performance goals for children with disabilities, 
consistent with the standards and expectations for all students in the 
educational system, and provide for appropriate and effective strategies 
and methods to ensure that students who are children with disabilities 
have maximum opportunities to achieve those standards and goals. 
[Section 651(a)(6)(A) of the Act.]
    Accordingly, the evaluation and IEP provisions of Part B place great 
emphasis on the involvement and progress of children with disabilities 
in the general curriculum. (The term ``general curriculum,'' as used in 
these regulations, including this Appendix, refers to the curriculum 
that is used with nondisabled children.)
    While the Act and regulations recognize that IEP teams must make 
individualized decisions about the special education and related 
services, and supplementary aids and services, provided to each child 
with a disability, they are driven by IDEA's strong preference that, to 
the maximum extent appropriate, children with disabilities be educated 
in regular classes with their nondisabled peers with appropriate 
supplementary aids and services.
    In many cases, children with disabilities will need appropriate 
supports in order to successfully progress in the general curriculum, 
participate in State and district-wide assessment programs, achieve the 
measurable goals in their IEPs, and be educated together with their 
nondisabled peers. Accordingly, the Act requires the IEP team to 
determine, and the public agency to provide, the accommodations, 
modifications, supports, and supplementary aids and services, needed by 
each child with a disability to successfully be involved in and progress 
in the general curriculum achieve the goals of the IEP, and successfully 
demonstrate his or her competencies in State and district-wide 
assessments.
    1. What are the major Part B IEP requirements that govern the 
involvement and progress of children with disabilities in the general 
curriculum?

                Present Levels of Educational Performance

    Section 300.347(a)(1) requires that the IEP for each child with a 
disability include ``* * * a statement of the child's present levels of 
educational performance, including--(i) how the child's disability 
affects the child's involvement and progress in the general curriculum; 
or (ii) for preschool children, as appropriate, how the child's 
disability affects the child's participation in appropriate activities * 
* *'' (``Appropriate activities'' in this context refers to age-relevant 
developmental abilities or milestones that typically developing children 
of the same age would be performing or would have achieved.)
    The IEP team's determination of how each child's disability affects 
the child's involvement and progress in the general curriculum is a 
primary consideration in the development of the child's IEP. In 
assessing children with disabilities, school districts may use a variety 
of assessment techniques to determine the extent to which these children 
can

[[Page 101]]

be involved and progress in the general curriculum, such as criterion-
referenced tests, standard achievement tests, diagnostic tests, other 
tests, or any combination of the above.
    The purpose of using these assessments is to determine the child's 
present levels of educational performance and areas of need arising from 
the child's disability so that approaches for ensuring the child's 
involvement and progress in the general curriculum and any needed 
adaptations or modifications to that curriculum can be identified.
    Measurable Annual Goals, including Benchmarks or Short-term 
ojectives
    Measurable annual goals, including benchmarks or short-term 
objectives, are critical to the strategic planning process used to 
develop and implement the IEP for each child with a disability. Once the 
IEP team has developed measurable annual goals for a child, the team (1) 
can develop strategies that will be most effective in realizing those 
goals and (2) must develop either measurable, intermediate steps (short-
term objectives) or major milestones (benchmarks) that will enable 
parents, students, and educators to monitor progress during the year, 
and, if appropriate, to revise the IEP consistent with the student's 
instructional needs.
    The strong emphasis in Part B on linking the educational program of 
children with disabilities to the general curriculum is reflected in 
Sec.  300.347(a)(2), which requires that the IEP include:

    A statement of measurable annual goals, including benchmarks or 
short-term objectives, related to--(i) meeting the child's needs that 
result from the child's disability to enable the child to be involved in 
and progress in the general curriculum; and (ii) meeting each of the 
child's other educational needs that result from the child's disability.
    As noted above, each annual goal must include either short-term 
objectives or benchmarks. The purpose of both is to enable a child's 
teacher(s), parents, and others involved in developing and implementing 
the child's IEP, to gauge, at intermediate times during the year, how 
well the child is progressing toward achievement of the annual goal. IEP 
teams may continue to develop short-term instructional objectives, that 
generally break the skills described in the annual goal down into 
discrete components. The revised statute and regulations also provide 
that, as an alternative, IEP teams may develop benchmarks, which can be 
thought of as describing the amount of progress the child is expected to 
make within specified segments of the year. Generally, benchmarks 
establish expected performance levels that allow for regular checks of 
progress that coincide with the reporting periods for informing parents 
of their child's progress toward achieving the annual goals. An IEP team 
may use either short term objectives or benchmarks or a combination of 
the two depending on the nature of the annual goals and the needs of the 
child.

   Special Education and Related Services and Supplementary Aids and 
                                Services

    The requirements regarding services provided to address a child's 
present levels of educational performance and to make progress toward 
the identified goals reinforce the emphasis on progress in the general 
curriculum, as well as maximizing the extent to which children with 
disabilities are educated with nondisabled children. Section 
300.347(a)(3) requires that the IEP include:

    A statement of the special education and related services and 
supplementary aids and services to be provided to the child, or on 
behalf of the child, and a statement of the program modifications or 
supports for school personnel that will be provided for the child--(i) 
to advance appropriately toward attaining the annual goals; (ii) to be 
involved and progress in the general curriculum * * * and to participate 
in extracurricular and other nonacademic activities; and (iii) to be 
educated and participate with other children with disabilities and 
nondisabled children in [extracurricular and other nonacademic 
activities] * * * [Italics added.]

    Extent to Which Child Will Participate With Nondisabled Children

    Section 300.347(a)(4) requires that each child's IEP include ``An 
explanation of the extent, if any, to which the child will not 
participate with nondisabled children in the regular class and in 
[extracurricular and other nonacademic] activities * * *'' This is 
consistent with the least restrictive environment (LRE) provisions at 
Sec. Sec.  300.550-300.553, which include requirements that:
    (1) each child with a disability be educated with nondisabled 
children to the maximum extent appropriate (Sec.  300.550(b)(1));
    (2) each child with a disability be removed from the regular 
educational environment only when the nature or severity of the child's 
disability is such that education in regular classes with the use of 
supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily (Sec.  
300.550(b)(1)); and
    (3) to the maximum extent appropriate to the child's needs, each 
child with a disability participates with nondisabled children in 
nonacademic and extracurricular services and activities (Sec.  300.553).
    All services and educational placements under Part B must be 
individually determined in light of each child's unique abilities and 
needs, to reasonably promote the child's educational success. Placing 
children with disabilities in this manner should enable each disabled 
child to meet high expectations in the future.
    Although Part B requires that a child with a disability not be 
removed from the regular

[[Page 102]]

educational environment if the child's education can be achieved 
satisfactorily in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and 
services, Part B's LRE principle is intended to ensure that a child with 
a disability is served in a setting where the child can be educated 
successfully. Even though IDEA does not mandate regular class placement 
for every disabled student, IDEA presumes that the first placement 
option considered for each disabled student by the student's placement 
team, which must include the parent, is the school the child would 
attend if not disabled, with appropriate supplementary aids and services 
to facilitate such placement. Thus, before a disabled child can be 
placed outside of the regular educational environment, the full range of 
supplementary aids and services that if provided would facilitate the 
student's placement in the regular classroom setting must be considered. 
Following that consideration, if a determination is made that particular 
disabled student cannot be educated satisfactorily in the regular 
educational environment, even with the provision of appropriate 
supplementary aids and services, that student then could be placed in a 
setting other than the regular classroom. Later, if it becomes apparent 
that the child's IEP can be carried out in a less restrictive setting, 
with the provision of appropriate supplementary aids and services, if 
needed, Part B would require that the child's placement be changed from 
the more restrictive setting to a less restrictive setting. In all 
cases, placement decisions must be individually determined on the basis 
of each child's abilities and needs, and not solely on factors such as 
category of disability, significance of disability, availability of 
special education and related services, configuration of the service 
delivery system, availability of space, or administrative convenience. 
Rather, each student's IEP forms the basis for the placement decision.
    Further, a student need not fail in the regular classroom before 
another placement can be considered. Conversely, IDEA does not require 
that a student demonstrate achievement of a specific performance level 
as a prerequisite for placement into a regular classroom.

     Participation in State or District-Wide Assessments of Student 
                               Achievement

    Consistent with Sec.  300.138(a), which sets forth a presumption 
that children with disabilities will be included in general State and 
district-wide assessment programs, and provided with appropriate 
accommodations if necessary, Sec.  300.347(a)(5) requires that the IEP 
for each student with a disability include: ``(i) a statement of any 
individual modifications in the administration of State or district-wide 
assessments of student achievement that are needed in order for the 
child to participate in the assessment; and (ii) if the IEP team 
determines that the child will not participate in a particular State or 
district-wide assessment of student achievement (or part of an 
assessment of student achievement), a statement of--(A) Why that 
assessment is not appropriate for the child; and (B) How the child will 
be assessed.''

Regular Education Teacher Participation in the Development, Review, and 
                            Revision of IEPs

    Very often, regular education teachers play a central role in the 
education of children with disabilities (H. Rep. No. 105-95, p. 103 
(1997); S. Rep. No. 105-17, p. 23 (1997)) and have important expertise 
regarding the general curriculum and the general education environment. 
Further, with the emphasis on involvement and progress in the general 
curriculum added by the IDEA Amendments of 1997, regular education 
teachers have an increasingly critical role (together with special 
education and related services personnel) in implementing the program of 
FAPE for most children with disabilities, as described in their IEPs.
    Accordingly, the IDEA Amendments of 1997 added a requirement that 
each child's IEP team must include at least one regular education 
teacher of the child, if the child is, or may be, participating in the 
regular education environment (see Sec.  300.344(a)(2)). (See also 
Sec. Sec.  300.346(d) on the role of a regular education teacher in the 
development, review and revision of IEPs.)
    2. Must a child's IEP address his or her involvement in the general 
curriculum, regardless of the nature and severity of the child's 
disability and the setting in which the child is educated?
    Yes. The IEP for each child with a disability (including children 
who are educated in separate classrooms or schools) must address how the 
child will be involved and progress in the general curriculum. However, 
the Part B regulations recognize that some children have other 
educational needs resulting from their disability that also must be met, 
even though those needs are not directly linked to participation in the 
general curriculum.
    Accordingly, Sec.  300.347(a)(1)(2) requires that each child's IEP 
include:
    A statement of measurable annual goals, including benchmarks or 
short-term objectives related to--(i) Meeting the child's needs that 
result from the child's disability to enable the child to be involved in 
and progress in the general curriculum; and (ii) meeting each of the 
child's other educational needs that result from the child's disability. 
[Italics added.]
    Thus, the IEP team for each child with a disability must make an 
individualized determination regarding (1) how the child will

[[Page 103]]

be involved and progress in the general curriculum and what needs that 
result from the child's disability must be met to facilitate that 
participation; (2) whether the child has any other educational needs 
resulting from his or her disability that also must be met; and (3) what 
special education and other services and supports must be described in 
the child's IEP to address both sets of needs (consistent with Sec.  
300.347(a)). For example, if the IEP team determines that in order for a 
child who is deaf to participate in the general curriculum he or she 
needs sign language and materials which reflect his or her language 
development, those needs (relating to the child's participation in the 
general curriculum) must be addressed in the child's IEP. In addition, 
if the team determines that the child also needs to expand his or her 
vocabulary in sign language that service must also be addressed in the 
applicable components of the child's IEP. The IEP team may also wish to 
consider whether there is a need for members of the child's family to 
receive training in sign language in order for the child to receive 
FAPE.
    3. What must public agencies do to meet the requirements at 
Sec. Sec.  300.344(a)(2) and 300.346(d) regarding the participation of a 
``regular education teacher'' in the development, review, and revision 
of IEPs, for children aged 3 through 5 who are receiving preschool 
special education services?
    If a public agency provides ``regular education'' preschool services 
to non-disabled children, then the requirements of Sec. Sec.  
300.344(a)(2) and 300.346(d) apply as they do in the case of older 
children with disabilities. If a public agency makes kindergarten 
available to nondisabled children, then a regular education kindergarten 
teacher could appropriately be the regular education teacher who would 
be a member of the IEP team, and, as appropriate, participate in IEP 
meetings, for a kindergarten-aged child who is, or may be, participating 
in the regular education environment.
    If a public agency does not provide regular preschool education 
services to nondisabled children, the agency could designate an 
individual who, under State standards, is qualified to serve nondisabled 
children of the same age.
    4. Must the measurable annual goals in a child's IEP address all 
areas of the general curriculum, or only those areas in which the 
child's involvement and progress are affected by the child's disability?
    Section 300.347(a)(2) requires that each child's IEP include ``A 
statement of measurable annual goals, including benchmarks or short-term 
objectives, related to--(i) meeting the child's needs that result from 
the child's disability to enable the child to be involved in and 
progress in the general curriculum * * *; and (ii) meeting each of the 
child's other educational needs that result from the child's disability. 
. . .'' (Italics added).
    Thus, a public agency is not required to include in an IEP annual 
goals that relate to areas of the general curriculum in which the 
child's disability does not affect the child's ability to be involved in 
and progress in the general curriculum. If a child with a disability 
needs only modifications or accommodations in order to progress in an 
area of the general curriculum, the IEP does not need to include a goal 
for that area; however, the IEP would need to specify those 
modifications or accommodations.
    Public agencies often require all children, including children with 
disabilities, to demonstrate mastery in a given area of the general 
curriculum before allowing them to progress to the next level or grade 
in that area. Thus, in order to ensure that each child with a disability 
can effectively demonstrate competencies in an applicable area of the 
general curriculum, it is important for the IEP team to consider the 
accommodations and modifications that the child needs to assist him or 
her in demonstrating progress in that area.

                 II. Involvement of Parents and Students

    The Congressional Committee Reports on the IDEA Amendments of 1997 
express the view that the Amendments provide an opportunity for 
strengthening the role of parents, and emphasize that one of the 
purposes of the Amendments is to expand opportunities for parents and 
key public agency staff (e.g., special education, related services, 
regular education, and early intervention service providers, and other 
personnel) to work in new partnerships at both the State and local 
levels (H. Rep. 105-95, p. 82 (1997); S. Rep. No. 105-17, p. 4 and 5 
(1997)). Accordingly, the IDEA Amendments of 1997 require that parents 
have an opportunity to participate in meetings with respect to the 
identification, evaluation, and educational placement of the child, and 
the provision of FAPE to the child. (Sec.  300.501(a)(2)). Thus, parents 
must now be part of: (1) the group that determines what additional data 
are needed as part of an evaluation of their child (Sec.  
300.533(a)(1)); (2) the team that determines their child's eligibility 
(Sec.  300.534(a)(1)); and (3) the group that makes decisions on the 
educational placement of their child (Sec.  300.501(c)).
    In addition, the concerns of parents and the information that they 
provide regarding their children must be considered in developing and 
reviewing their children's IEPs (Sec. Sec.  300.343(c)(iii) and 
300.346(a)(1)(i) and (b)); and the requirements for keeping parents 
informed about the educational progress of their children, particularly 
as it relates to their progress in the general curriculum, have been 
strengthened (Sec.  300.347(a)(7)).

[[Page 104]]

    The IDEA Amendments of 1997 also contain provisions that greatly 
strengthen the involvement of students with disabilities in decisions 
regarding their own futures, to facilitate movement from school to post-
school activities. For example, those amendments (1) retained, 
essentially verbatim, the ``transition services'' requirements from the 
IDEA Amendments of 1990 (which provide that a statement of needed 
transition services must be in the IEP of each student with a 
disability, beginning no later than age 16); and (2) significantly 
expanded those provisions by adding a new annual requirement for the IEP 
to include ``transition planning'' activities for students beginning at 
age 14. (See section IV of this appendix for a description of the 
transition services requirements and definition.)
    With respect to student involvement in decisions regarding 
transition services, Sec.  300.344(b) provides that (1) ``the public 
agency shall invite a student with a disability of any age to attend his 
or her IEP meeting if a purpose of the meeting will be the consideration 
of--(i) The student's transition services needs under Sec.  
300.347(b)(1); or (ii) The needed transition services for the student 
under Sec.  300.347(b)(2); or (iii) Both;'' and (2) ``If the student 
does not attend the IEP meeting, the public agency shall take other 
steps to ensure that the student's preferences and interests are 
considered.'' (Sec.  300.344(b)(2)).
    The IDEA Amendments of 1997 also give States the authority to elect 
to transfer the rights accorded to parents under Part B to each student 
with a disability upon reaching the age of majority under State law (if 
the student has not been determined incompetent under State law) (Sec.  
300.517). (Part B requires that if the rights transfer to the student, 
the public agency must provide any notice required under Part B to both 
the student and the parents.) If the State elects to provide for the 
transfer of rights from the parents to the student at the age of 
majority, the IEP must, beginning at least one year before a student 
reaches the age of majority under State law, include a statement that 
the student has been informed of any rights that will transfer to him or 
her upon reaching the age of majority. (Sec.  300.347(c)).
    The IDEA Amendments of 1997 also permit, but do not require, States 
to establish a procedure for appointing the parent, or another 
appropriate individual if the parent is not available, to represent the 
educational interests of a student with a disability who has reached the 
age of majority under State law and has not been determined to be 
incompetent, but who is determined not to have the ability to provide 
informed consent with respect to his or her educational program.
    5. What is the role of the parents, including surrogate parents, in 
decisions regarding the educational program of their children?
    The parents of a child with a disability are expected to be equal 
participants along with school personnel, in developing, reviewing, and 
revising the IEP for their child. This is an active role in which the 
parents (1) provide critical information regarding the strengths of 
their child and express their concerns for enhancing the education of 
their child; (2) participate in discussions about the child's need for 
special education and related services and supplementary aids and 
services; and (3) join with the other participants in deciding how the 
child will be involved and progress in the general curriculum and 
participate in State and district-wide assessments, and what services 
the agency will provide to the child and in what setting.
    As previously noted in the introduction to section II of this 
Appendix, Part B specifically provides that parents of children with 
disabilities--
    [sbull] Have an opportunity to participate in meetings with respect 
to the identification, evaluation, and educational placement of their 
child, and the provision of FAPE to the child (including IEP meetings) 
(Sec. Sec.  300.501(b), 300.344(a)(1), and 300.517;
    [sbull] Be part of the groups that determine what additional data 
are needed as part of an evaluation of their child (Sec.  
300.533(a)(1)), and determine their child's eligibility (Sec.  
300.534(a)(1)) and educational placement (Sec.  300.501(c));
    [sbull] Have their concerns and the information that they provide 
regarding their child considered in developing and reviewing their 
child's IEPs (Sec. Sec.  300.343(c)(iii) and 300.346(a)(1)(i) and (b)); 
and
    [sbull] Be regularly informed (by such means as periodic report 
cards), as specified in their child's IEP, at least as often as parents 
are informed of their nondisabled children's progress, of their child's 
progress toward the annual goals in the IEP and the extent to which that 
progress is sufficient to enable the child to achieve the goals by the 
end of the year (Sec.  300.347(a)(7)).
    A surrogate parent is a person appointed to represent the interests 
of a child with a disability in the educational decision-making process 
when no parent (as defined at Sec.  300.20) is known, the agency, after 
reasonable efforts, cannot locate the child's parents, or the child is a 
ward of the State under the laws of the State. A surrogate parent has 
all of the rights and responsibilities of a parent under Part B (Sec.  
300.515.)
    6. What are the Part B requirements regarding the participation of a 
student (child) with a disability in an IEP meeting?
    If a purpose of an IEP meeting for a student with a disability will 
be the consideration of the student's transition services needs or 
needed transition services under Sec.  300.347(b)(1) or (2), or both, 
the public agency must invite the student and, as part of

[[Page 105]]

the notification to the parents of the IEP meeting, inform the parents 
that the agency will invite the student to the IEP meeting.
    If the student does not attend, the public agency must take other 
steps to ensure that the student's preferences and interests are 
considered. (See Sec.  300.344(b)).
    Section Sec.  300.517 permits, but does not require, States to 
transfer procedural rights under Part B from the parents to students 
with disabilities who reach the age of majority under State law, if they 
have not been determined to be incompetent under State law. If those 
rights are to be transferred from the parents to the student, the public 
agency would be required to ensure that the student has the right to 
participate in IEP meetings set forth for parents in Sec.  300.345. 
However, at the discretion of the student or the public agency, the 
parents also could attend IEP meetings as ``* * * individuals who have 
knowledge or special expertise regarding the child * * *'' (see Sec.  
300.344(a)(6)).
    In other circumstances, a child with a disability may attend ``if 
appropriate.'' (Sec.  300.344(a)(7)). Generally, a child with a 
disability should attend the IEP meeting if the parent decides that it 
is appropriate for the child to do so. If possible, the agency and 
parents should discuss the appropriateness of the child's participation 
before a decision is made, in order to help the parents determine 
whether or not the child's attendance would be (1) helpful in developing 
the IEP or (2) directly beneficial to the child or both. The agency 
should inform the parents before each IEP meeting--as part of 
notification under Sec.  300.345(a)(1)--that they may invite their child 
to participate.
    7. Must the public agency inform the parents of who will be at the 
IEP meeting?
    Yes. In notifying parents about the meeting, the agency ``must 
indicate the purpose, time, and location of the meeting, and who will be 
in attendance.'' (Sec.  300.345(b), italics added.) In addition, if a 
purpose of the IEP meeting will be the consideration of a student's 
transition services needs or needed transition services under Sec.  
300.347(b)(1) or (2) or both, the notice must also inform the parents 
that the agency is inviting the student, and identify any other agency 
that will be invited to send a representative.
    The public agency also must inform the parents of the right of the 
parents and the agency to invite other individuals who have knowledge or 
special expertise regarding the child, including related services 
personnel as appropriate to be members of the IEP team. (Sec.  
300.345(b)(1)(ii).)
    It also may be appropriate for the agency to ask the parents to 
inform the agency of any individuals the parents will be bringing to the 
meeting. Parents are encouraged to let the agency know whom they intend 
to bring. Such cooperation can facilitate arrangements for the meeting, 
and help ensure a productive, child-centered meeting.
    8. Do parents have the right to a copy of their child's IEP?
    Yes. Section 300.345(f) states that the public agency shall give the 
parent a copy of the IEP at no cost to the parent.
    9. What is a public agency's responsibility if it is not possible to 
reach consensus on what services should be included in a child's IEP?
    The IEP meeting serves as a communication vehicle between parents 
and school personnel, and enables them, as equal participants, to make 
joint, informed decisions regarding the (1) child's needs and 
appropriate goals; (2) extent to which the child will be involved in the 
general curriculum and participate in the regular education environment 
and State and district-wide assessments; and (3) services needed to 
support that involvement and participation and to achieve agreed-upon 
goals. Parents are considered equal partners with school personnel in 
making these decisions, and the IEP team must consider the parents' 
concerns and the information that they provide regarding their child in 
developing, reviewing, and revising IEPs (Sec. Sec.  300.343(c)(iii) and 
300.346(a)(1) and (b)).
    The IEP team should work toward consensus, but the public agency has 
ultimate responsibility to ensure that the IEP includes the services 
that the child needs in order to receive FAPE. It is not appropriate to 
make IEP decisions based upon a majority ``vote.'' If the team cannot 
reach consensus, the public agency must provide the parents with prior 
written notice of the agency's proposals or refusals, or both, regarding 
the child's educational program, and the parents have the right to seek 
resolution of any disagreements by initiating an impartial due process 
hearing.
    Every effort should be made to resolve differences between parents 
and school staff through voluntary mediation or some other informal 
step, without resort to a due process hearing. However, mediation or 
other informal procedures may not be used to deny or delay a parent's 
right to a due process hearing, or to deny any other rights afforded 
under Part B.
    10. Does Part B require that public agencies inform parents 
regarding the educational progress of their children with disabilities?
    Yes. The Part B statute and regulations include a number of 
provisions to help ensure that parents are involved in decisions 
regarding, and are informed about, their child's educational progress, 
including the child's progress in the general curriculum. First, the 
parents will be informed regarding their child's present levels of 
educational performance through the development of the

[[Page 106]]

IEP. Section 300.347(a)(1) requires that each IEP include:
    * * * A statement of the child's present levels of educational 
performance, including--(i) how the child's disability affects the 
child's involvement and progress in the general curriculum; or (ii) for 
preschool children, as appropriate, how the disability affects the 
child's participation in appropriate activities * * *
    Further, Sec.  300.347(a)(7) sets forth new requirements for 
regularly informing parents about their child's educational progress, as 
regularly as parents of nondisabled children are informed of their 
child's progress. That section requires that the IEP include:
    A statement of--(i) How the child's progress toward the annual goals 
* * * will be measured; and (ii) how the child's parents will be 
regularly informed (by such means as periodic report cards), at least as 
often as parents are informed of their nondisabled children's progress, 
of--(A) their child's progress toward the annual goals; and (B) the 
extent to which that progress is sufficient to enable the child to 
achieve the goals by the end of the year.
    One method that public agencies could use in meeting this 
requirement would be to provide periodic report cards to the parents of 
students with disabilities that include both (1) the grading information 
provided for all children in the agency at the same intervals; and (2) 
the specific information required by Sec.  300.347(a)(7)(ii)(A) and (B).
    Finally, the parents, as part of the IEP team, will participate at 
least once every 12 months in a review of their child's educational 
progress. Section 300.343(c) requires that a public agency initiate and 
conduct a meeting, at which the IEP team:
    * * * (1) Reviews the child's IEP periodically, but not less than 
annually to determine whether the annual goals for the child are being 
achieved; and (2) revises the IEP as appropriate to address--(i) any 
lack of expected progress toward the annual goals * * * and in the 
general curriculum, if appropriate; (ii) The results of any reevaluation 
* * *; (iii) Information about the child provided to, or by, the parents 
* * *; (iv) The child's anticipated needs; or (v) Other matters.

III. Preparing Students With Disabilities for Employment and Other Post-
                           School Experiences

    One of the primary purposes of the IDEA is to ``* * * ensure that 
all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate 
public education that emphasizes special education and related services 
designed to meet their unique needs and prepare them for employment and 
independent living * * *'' (Sec.  300.1(a)). Section 701 of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973 describes the philosophy of independent 
living as including a philosophy of consumer control, peer support, 
self-help, self-determination, equal access, and individual and system 
advocacy, in order to maximize the leadership, empowerment, 
independence, and productivity of individuals with disabilities, and the 
integration and full inclusion of individuals with disabilities into the 
mainstream of American society. Because many students receiving services 
under IDEA will also receive services under the Rehabilitation Act, it 
is important, in planning for their future, to consider the impact of 
both statutes.
    Similarly, one of the key purposes of the IDEA Amendments of 1997 
was to ``promote improved educational results for children with 
disabilities through early intervention, preschool, and educational 
experiences that prepare them for later educational challenges and 
employment.'' (H. Rep. No. 105-95, p. 82 (1997); S. Rep. No. 105-17, p. 
4 (1997)).
    Thus, throughout their preschool, elementary, and secondary 
education, the IEPs for children with disabilities must, to the extent 
appropriate for each individual child, focus on providing instruction 
and experiences that enable the child to prepare himself or herself for 
later educational experiences and for post-school activities, including 
formal education, if appropriate, employment, and independent living. 
Many students with disabilities will obtain services through State 
vocational rehabilitation programs to ensure that their educational 
goals are effectively implemented in post-school activities. Services 
available through rehabilitation programs are consistent with the 
underlying purpose of IDEA.
    Although preparation for adult life is a key component of FAPE 
throughout the educational experiences of students with disabilities, 
Part B sets forth specific requirements related to transition planning 
and transition services that must be implemented no later than ages 14 
and 16, respectively, and which require an intensified focus on that 
preparation as these students begin and prepare to complete their 
secondary education.
    11. What must the IEP team do to meet the requirements that the IEP 
include ``a statement of * * * transition service needs'' beginning at 
age 14 (Sec.  300.347(b)(1)(i)),'' and a statement of needed transition 
services'' no later than age 16 (Sec.  300.347(b)(2)?
    Section 300.347(b)(1) requires that, beginning no later than age 14, 
each student's IEP include specific transition-related content, and, 
beginning no later than age 16, a statement of needed transition 
services:
    Beginning at age 14 and younger if appropriate, and updated 
annually, each student's IEP must include:

    ``* * * a statement of the transition service needs of the student 
under the applicable components of the student's IEP that focuses on the 
student's courses of study (such as participation in advanced-placement 
courses

[[Page 107]]

or a vocational education program)'' (Sec.  300.347(b)(1)(i)).
    Beginning at age 16 (or younger, if determined appropriate by the 
IEP team), each student's IEP must include:

    ``* * * a statement of needed transition services for the student, 
including, if appropriate, a statement of the interagency 
responsibilities or any needed linkages.'' (Sec.  300.347(b)(2)).
    The Committee Reports on the IDEA Amendments of 1997 make clear that 
the requirement added to the statute in 1997 that beginning at age 14, 
and updated annually, the IEP include ``a statement of the transition 
service needs'' is ``* * * designed to augment, and not replace,'' the 
separate, preexisting requirement that the IEP include, ``* * * 
beginning at age 16 (or younger, if determined appropriate by the IEP 
team), a statement of needed transition services * * *'' (H. Rep. No. 
105-95, p. 102 (1997); S. Rep. No. 105-17, p. 22 (1997)). As clarified 
by the Reports, ``The purpose of [the requirement in Sec.  
300.347(b)(1)(i)] is to focus attention on how the child's educational 
program can be planned to help the child make a successful transition to 
his or her goals for life after secondary school.'' (H. Rep. No. 105-95, 
pp. 101-102 (1997); S. Rep. No. 105-17, p. 22 (1997)). The Reports 
further explain that ``[F]or example, for a child whose transition goal 
is a job, a transition service could be teaching the child how to get to 
the job site on public transportation.'' (H. Rep. No. 105-95, p. 102 
(1997); S. Rep. No. 105-17, p. 22 (1997)).
    Thus, beginning at age 14, the IEP team, in determining appropriate 
measurable annual goals (including benchmarks or short-term objectives) 
and services for a student, must determine what instruction and 
educational experiences will assist the student to prepare for 
transition from secondary education to post-secondary life.
    The statement of transition service needs should relate directly to 
the student's goals beyond secondary education, and show how planned 
studies are linked to these goals. For example, a student interested in 
exploring a career in computer science may have a statement of 
transition services needs connected to technology course work, while 
another student's statement of transition services needs could describe 
why public bus transportation training is important for future 
independence in the community.
    Although the focus of the transition planning process may shift as 
the student approaches graduation, the IEP team must discuss specific 
areas beginning at least at the age of 14 years and review these areas 
annually. As noted in the Committee Reports, a disproportionate number 
of students with disabilities drop out of school before they complete 
their secondary education: ``Too many students with disabilities are 
failing courses and dropping out of school. Almost twice as many 
students with disabilities drop out as compared to students without 
disabilities.'' (H. Rep. No. 105-95, p. 85 (1997), S. Rep. No. 105-17, 
p. 5 (1997).)
    To help reduce the number of students with disabilities that drop 
out, it is important that the IEP team work with each student with a 
disability and the student's family to select courses of study that will 
be meaningful to the student's future and motivate the student to 
complete his or her education.
    This requirement is distinct from the requirement, at Sec.  
300.347(b)(2), that the IEP include:

    * * * beginning at age 16 (or younger, if determined appropriate by 
the IEP team), a statement of needed transition services for the child, 
including, if appropriate, a statement of the interagency 
responsibilities or any needed linkages.
    The term ``transition services'' is defined at Sec.  300.29 to mean:

    * * * a coordinated set of activities for a student with a 
disability that--(1) Is designed within an outcome-oriented process, 
that promotes movement from school to post-school activities, including 
postsecondary education, vocational training, integrated employment 
(including supported employment), continuing and adult education, adult 
services, independent living, or community participation; (2) Is based 
on the individual student's needs, taking into account the student's 
preferences and interests; and (3) Includes--(i) Instruction; (ii) 
Related services; (iii) Community experiences; (iv) The development of 
employment and other post-school adult living objectives; and (v) If 
appropriate, acquisition of daily living skills and functional 
vocational evaluation.
    Thus, while Sec.  300.347(b)(1) requires that the IEP team begin by 
age 14 to address the student's need for instruction that will assist 
the student to prepare for transition, the IEP must include by age 16 a 
statement of needed transition services under Sec.  300.347(b)(2) that 
includes a ``coordinated set of activities * * *, designed within an 
outcome-oriented process, that promotes movement from school to post-
school activities * * *.'' (Sec.  300.29) Section 300.344(b)(3) further 
requires that, in implementing Sec.  300.347(b)(1), public agencies (in 
addition to required participants for all IEP meetings), must also 
invite a representative of any other agency that is likely to be 
responsible for providing or paying for transition services. Thus, Sec.  
300.347(b)(2) requires a broader focus on coordination of services 
across, and linkages between, agencies beyond the SEA and LEA.
    12. Must the IEP for each student with a disability, beginning no 
later than age 16, include all ``needed transition services,'' as 
identified by the IEP team and consistent

[[Page 108]]

with the definition at Sec.  300.29, even if an agency other than the 
public agency will provide those services? What is the public agency's 
responsibility if another agency fails to provide agreed-upon transition 
services?
    Section 300.347(b)(2) requires that the IEP for each child with a 
disability, beginning no later than age 16, or younger if determined 
appropriate by the IEP team, include all ``needed transition services,'' 
as identified by the IEP team and consistent with the definition at 
Sec.  300.29, regardless of whether the public agency or some other 
agency will provide those services. Section 300.347(b)(2) specifically 
requires that the statement of needed transition services include, ``* * 
* if appropriate, a statement of the interagency responsibilities or any 
needed linkages.''
    Further, the IDEA Amendments of 1997 also permit an LEA to use up to 
five percent of the Part B funds it receives in any fiscal year in 
combination with other amounts, which must include amounts other than 
education funds, to develop and implement a coordinated services system. 
These funds may be used for activities such as: (1) linking IEPs under 
Part B and Individualized Family Service Plans (IFSPs) under Part C, 
with Individualized Service Plans developed under multiple Federal and 
State programs, such as Title I of the Rehabilitation Act; and (2) 
developing and implementing interagency financing strategies for the 
provision of services, including transition services under Part B.
    The need to include, as part of a student's IEP, transition services 
to be provided by agencies other than the public agency is contemplated 
by Sec.  300.348(a), which specifies what the public agency must do if 
another agency participating in the development of the statement of 
needed transition services fails to provide a needed transition service 
that it had agreed to provide.
    If an agreed-upon service by another agency is not provided, the 
public agency responsible for the student's education must implement 
alternative strategies to meet the student's needs. This requires that 
the public agency provide the services, or convene an IEP meeting as 
soon as possible to identify alternative strategies to meet the 
transition services objectives, and to revise the IEP accordingly.
    Alternative strategies might include the identification of another 
funding source, referral to another agency, the public agency's 
identification of other district-wide or community resources that it can 
use to meet the student's identified needs appropriately, or a 
combination of these strategies. As emphasized by Sec.  300.348(b), 
however:
    Nothing in [Part B] relieves any participating agency, including a 
State vocational rehabilitation agency, of the responsibility to provide 
or pay for any transition service that the agency would otherwise 
provide to students with disabilities who meet the eligibility criteria 
of that agency.
    However, the fact that an agency other than the public agency does 
not fulfill its responsibility does not relieve the public agency of its 
responsibility to ensure that FAPE is available to each student with a 
disability. (Section 300.142(b)(2) specifically requires that if an 
agency other than the LEA fails to provide or pay for a special 
education or related service (which could include a transition service), 
the LEA must, without delay, provide or pay for the service, and may 
then claim reimbursement from the agency that failed to provide or pay 
for the service.)
    13. Under what circumstances must a public agency invite 
representatives from other agencies to an IEP meeting at which a child's 
need for transition services will be considered?
    Section 300.344 requires that, ``In implementing the requirements of 
[Sec.  300.347(b)(1)(ii) requiring a statement of needed transition 
services], the public agency shall also invite a representative of any 
other agency that is likely to be responsible for providing or paying 
for transition services.'' To meet this requirement, the public agency 
must identify all agencies that are ``likely to be responsible for 
providing or paying for transition services'' for each student addressed 
by Sec.  300.347(b)(1), and must invite each of those agencies to the 
IEP meeting; and if an agency invited to send a representative to a 
meeting does not do so, the public agency must take other steps to 
obtain the participation of that agency in the planning of any 
transition services.
    If, during the course of an IEP meeting, the team identifies 
additional agencies that are ``likely to be responsible for providing or 
paying for transition services'' for the student, the public agency must 
determine how it will meet the requirements of Sec.  300.344.

    IV. Other Questions Regarding the Development and Content of IEPS

    14. For a child with a disability receiving special education for 
the first time, when must an IEP be developed--before or after the child 
begins to receive special education and related services?
    Section 300.342(b)(1) requires that an IEP be ``in effect before 
special education and related services are provided to an eligible child 
* * *'' (Italics added.)
    The appropriate placement for a particular child with a disability 
cannot be determined until after decisions have been made about the 
child's needs and the services that the public agency will provide to 
meet those needs. These decisions must be made at the IEP meeting, and 
it would not be permissible first to place the child and then develop 
the IEP. Therefore, the IEP must be developed

[[Page 109]]

before placement. (Further, the child's placement must be based, among 
other factors, on the child's IEP.)
    This requirement does not preclude temporarily placing an eligible 
child with a disability in a program as part of the evaluation process--
before the IEP is finalized--to assist a public agency in determining 
the appropriate placement for the child. However, it is essential that 
the temporary placement not become the final placement before the IEP is 
finalized. In order to ensure that this does not happen, the State might 
consider requiring LEAs to take the following actions:
    a. Develop an interim IEP for the child that sets out the specific 
conditions and timelines for the trial placement. (See paragraph c, 
following.)
    b. Ensure that the parents agree to the interim placement before it 
is carried out, and that they are involved throughout the process of 
developing, reviewing, and revising the child's IEP.
    c. Set a specific timeline (e.g., 30 days) for completing the 
evaluation, finalizing the IEP, and determining the appropriate 
placement for the child.
    d. Conduct an IEP meeting at the end of the trial period in order to 
finalize the child's IEP.
    15. Who is responsible for ensuring the development of IEPs for 
children with disabilities served by a public agency other than an LEA?
    The answer as to which public agency has direct responsibility for 
ensuring the development of IEPs for children with disabilities served 
by a public agency other than an LEA will vary from State to State, 
depending upon State law, policy, or practice. The SEA is ultimately 
responsible for ensuring that all Part B requirements, including the IEP 
requirements, are met for eligible children within the State, including 
those children served by a public agency other than an LEA. Thus, the 
SEA must ensure that every eligible child with a disability in the State 
has FAPE available, regardless of which State or local agency is 
responsible for educating the child. (The only exception to this 
responsibility is that the SEA is not responsible for ensuring that FAPE 
is made available to children with disabilities who are convicted as 
adults under State law and incarcerated in adult prisons, if the State 
has assigned that responsibility to a public agency other than the SEA. 
(See Sec.  300.600(d)).
    Although the SEA has flexibility in deciding the best means to meet 
this obligation (e.g., through interagency agreements), the SEA must 
ensure that no eligible child with a disability is denied FAPE due to 
jurisdictional disputes among agencies.
    When an LEA is responsible for the education of a child with a 
disability, the LEA remains responsible for developing the child's IEP, 
regardless of the public or private school setting into which it places 
the child.
    16. For a child placed out of State by an educational or non-
educational State or local agency, is the placing or receiving State 
responsible for the child's IEP?
    Regardless of the reason for the placement, the ``placing'' State is 
responsible for ensuring that the child's IEP is developed and that it 
is implemented. The determination of the specific agency in the placing 
State that is responsible for the child's IEP would be based on State 
law, policy, or practice. However, the SEA in the placing State is 
ultimately responsible for ensuring that the child has FAPE available.
    17. If a disabled child has been receiving special education from 
one public agency and transfers to another public agency in the same 
State, must the new public agency develop an IEP before the child can be 
placed in a special education program?
    If a child with a disability moves from one public agency to another 
in the same State, the State and its public agencies have an ongoing 
responsibility to ensure that FAPE is made available to that child. This 
means that if a child moves to another public agency the new agency is 
responsible for ensuring that the child has available special education 
and related services in conformity with an IEP.
    The new public agency must ensure that the child has an IEP in 
effect before the agency can provide special education and related 
services. The new public agency may meet this responsibility by either 
adopting the IEP the former public agency developed for the child or by 
developing a new IEP for the child. (The new public agency is strongly 
encouraged to continue implementing the IEP developed by the former 
public agency, if appropriate, especially if the parents believe their 
child was progressing appropriately under that IEP.)
    Before the child's IEP is finalized, the new public agency may 
provide interim services agreed to by both the parents and the new 
public agency. If the parents and the new public agency are unable to 
agree on an interim IEP and placement, the new public agency must 
implement the old IEP to the extent possible until a new IEP is 
developed and implemented.
    In general, while the new public agency must conduct an IEP meeting, 
it would not be necessary if: (1) A copy of the child's current IEP is 
available; (2) the parents indicate that they are satisfied with the 
current IEP; and (3) the new public agency determines that the current 
IEP is appropriate and can be implemented as written.
    If the child's current IEP is not available, or if either the new 
public agency or the parent believes that it is not appropriate, the new 
public agency must develop a new IEP

[[Page 110]]

through appropriate procedures within a short time after the child 
enrolls in the new public agency (normally, within one week).
    18. What timelines apply to the development and implementation of an 
initial IEP for a child with a disability?
    Section 300.343(b) requires each public agency to ensure that within 
a reasonable period of time following the agency's receipt of parent 
consent to an initial evaluation of a child, the child is evaluated and, 
if determined eligible, special education and related services are made 
available to the child in accordance with an IEP. The section further 
requires the agency to conduct a meeting to develop an IEP for the child 
within 30 days of determining that the child needs special education and 
related services.
    Section 300.342(b)(2) provides that an IEP must be implemented as 
soon as possible following the meeting in which the IEP is developed.
    19. Must a public agency hold separate meetings to determine a 
child's eligibility for special education and related services, develop 
the child's IEP, and determine the child's placement, or may the agency 
meet all of these requirements in a single meeting?
    A public agency may, after a child is determined by ``a group of 
qualified professionals and the parent'' (see Sec.  300.534(a)(1)) to be 
a child with a disability, continue in the same meeting to develop an 
IEP for the child and then to determine the child's placement. However, 
the public agency must ensure that it meets: (1) the requirements of 
Sec.  300.535 regarding eligibility decisions; (2) all of the Part B 
requirements regarding meetings to develop IEPs (including providing 
appropriate notification to the parents, consistent with the 
requirements of Sec. Sec.  300.345, 300.503, and 300.504, and ensuring 
that all the required team members participate in the development of the 
IEP, consistent with the requirements of Sec.  300.344;) and (3) 
ensuring that the placement is made by the required individuals, 
including the parent, as required by Sec. Sec.  300.552 and 300.501(c).
    20. How frequently must a public agency conduct meetings to review, 
and, if appropriate, revise the IEP for each child with a disability?
    A public agency must initiate and conduct meetings periodically, but 
at least once every twelve months, to review each child's IEP, in order 
to determine whether the annual goals for the child are being achieved, 
and to revise the IEP, as appropriate, to address: (a) Any lack of 
expected progress toward the annual goals and in the general curriculum, 
if appropriate; (b) the results of any reevaluation; (c) information 
about the child provided to, or by, the parents; (d) the child's 
anticipated needs; or (e) other matters (Sec.  300.343(c)).
    A public agency also must ensure that an IEP is in effect for each 
child at the beginning of each school year (Sec.  300.342(a)). It may 
conduct IEP meetings at any time during the year. However, if the agency 
conducts the IEP meeting prior to the beginning of the next school year, 
it must ensure that the IEP contains the necessary special education and 
related services and supplementary aids and services to ensure that the 
student's IEP can be appropriately implemented during the next school 
year. Otherwise, it would be necessary for the public agency to conduct 
another IEP meeting.
    Although the public agency is responsible for determining when it is 
necessary to conduct an IEP meeting, the parents of a child with a 
disability have the right to request an IEP meeting at any time. For 
example, if the parents believe that the child is not progressing 
satisfactorily or that there is a problem with the child's current IEP, 
it would be appropriate for the parents to request an IEP meeting.
    If a child's teacher feels that the child's IEP or placement is not 
appropriate for the child, the teacher should follow agency procedures 
with respect to: (1) calling or meeting with the parents or (2) 
requesting the agency to hold another IEP meeting to review the child's 
IEP.
    The legislative history of Public Law 94-142 makes it clear that 
there should be as many meetings a year as any one child may need (121 
Cong. Rec. S20428-29 (Nov. 19, 1975) (remarks of Senator Stafford)). 
Public agencies should grant any reasonable parent request for an IEP 
meeting. For example, if the parents question the adequacy of services 
that are provided while their child is suspended for short periods of 
time, it would be appropriate to convene an IEP meeting.
    In general, if either a parent or a public agency believes that a 
required component of the student's IEP should be changed, the public 
agency must conduct an IEP meeting if it believes that a change in the 
IEP may be necessary to ensure the provision of FAPE.
    If a parent requests an IEP meeting because the parent believes that 
a change is needed in the provision of FAPE to the child or the 
educational placement of the child, and the agency refuses to convene an 
IEP meeting to determine whether such a change is needed, the agency 
must provide written notice to the parents of the refusal, including an 
explanation of why the agency has determined that conducting the meeting 
is not necessary to ensure the provision of FAPE to the student.
    Under Sec.  300.507(a), the parents or agency may initiate a due 
process hearing at any time regarding any proposal or refusal regarding 
the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child, 
or the

[[Page 111]]

provision of FAPE to the child, and the public agency must inform 
parents about the availability of mediation.
    21. May IEP meetings be audio- or video-tape-recorded?
    Part B does not address the use of audio or video recording devices 
at IEP meetings, and no other Federal statute either authorizes or 
prohibits the recording of an IEP meeting by either a parent or a school 
official. Therefore, an SEA or public agency has the option to require, 
prohibit, limit, or otherwise regulate the use of recording devices at 
IEP meetings.
    If a public agency has a policy that prohibits or limits the use of 
recording devices at IEP meetings, that policy must provide for 
exceptions if they are necessary to ensure that the parent understands 
the IEP or the IEP process or to implement other parental rights 
guaranteed under Part B. An SEA or school district that adopts a rule 
regulating the tape recording of IEP meetings also should ensure that it 
is uniformly applied.
    Any recording of an IEP meeting that is maintained by the public 
agency is an ``education record,'' within the meaning of the Family 
Educational Rights and Privacy Act (``FERPA''; 20 U.S.C. 1232g), and 
would, therefore, be subject to the confidentiality requirements of the 
regulations under both FERPA (34 CFR part 99) and part B (Sec. Sec.  
300.560-300.575).
    Parents wishing to use audio or video recording devices at IEP 
meetings should consult State or local policies for further guidance.
    22. Who can serve as the representative of the public agency at an 
IEP meeting?
    The IEP team must include a representative of the public agency who: 
(a) Is qualified to provide, or supervise the provision of, specially 
designed instruction to meet the unique needs of children with 
disabilities; (b) is knowledgeable about the general curriculum; and (c) 
is knowledgeable about the availability of resources of the public 
agency (Sec.  300.344(a)(4)).
    Each public agency may determine which specific staff member will 
serve as the agency representative in a particular IEP meeting, so long 
as the individual meets these requirements. It is important, however, 
that the agency representative have the authority to commit agency 
resources and be able to ensure that whatever services are set out in 
the IEP will actually be provided.
    A public agency may designate another public agency member of the 
IEP team to also serve as the agency representative, so long as that 
individual meets the requirements of Sec.  300.344(a)(4).
    23. For a child with a disability being considered for initial 
provision of special education and related services, which teacher or 
teachers should attend the IEP meeting?
    A child's IEP team must include at least one of the child's regular 
education teachers (if the child is, or may be participating in the 
regular education environment) and at least one of the child's special 
education teachers, or, if appropriate, at least one of the child's 
special education providers (Sec.  300.344(a)(2) and (3)).
    Each IEP must include a statement of the present levels of 
educational performance, including a statement of how the child's 
disability affects the child's involvement and progress in the general 
curriculum (Sec.  300.347(a)(1)). At least one regular education teacher 
is a required member of the IEP team of a child who is, or may be, 
participating in the regular educational environment, regardless of the 
extent of that participation.
    The requirements of Sec.  300.344(a)(3) can be met by either: (1) a 
special education teacher of the child; or (2) another special education 
provider of the child, such as a speech pathologist, physical or 
occupational therapist, etc., if the related service consists of 
specially designed instruction and is considered special education under 
applicable State standards.
    Sometimes more than one meeting is necessary in order to finalize a 
child's IEP. In this process, if the special education teacher or 
special education provider who will be working with the child is 
identified, it would be useful to have that teacher or provider 
participate in the meeting with the parents and other members of the IEP 
team in finalizing the IEP. If this is not possible, the public agency 
must ensure that the teacher or provider has access to the child's IEP 
as soon as possible after it is finalized and before beginning to work 
with the child.
    Further, (consistent with Sec.  300.342(b)), the public agency must 
ensure that each regular education teacher, special education teacher, 
related services provider and other service provider of an eligible 
child under this part (1) has access to the child's IEP, and (2) is 
informed of his or her specific responsibilities related to implementing 
the IEP, and of the specific accommodations, modifications, and supports 
that must be provided to the child in accordance with the IEP. This 
requirement is crucial to ensuring that each child receives FAPE in 
accordance with his or her IEP, and that the IEP is appropriately and 
effectively implemented.
    24. What is the role of a regular education teacher in the 
development, review and revision of the IEP for a child who is, or may 
be, participating in the regular education environment?
    As required by Sec.  300.344(a)(2), the IEP team for a child with a 
disability must include at least one regular education teacher of the 
child if the child is, or may be, participating

[[Page 112]]

in the regular education environment. Section 300.346(d) further 
specifies that the regular education teacher of a child with a 
disability, as a member of the IEP team, must, to the extent 
appropriate, participate in the development, review, and revision of the 
child's IEP, including assisting in--(1) the determination of 
appropriate positive behavioral interventions and strategies for the 
child; and (2) the determination of supplementary aids and services, 
program modifications, and supports for school personnel that will be 
provided for the child, consistent with 300.347(a)(3) (Sec.  
300.344(d)).
    Thus, while a regular education teacher must be a member of the IEP 
team if the child is, or may be, participating in the regular education 
environment, the teacher need not (depending upon the child's needs and 
the purpose of the specific IEP team meeting) be required to participate 
in all decisions made as part of the meeting or to be present throughout 
the entire meeting or attend every meeting. For example, the regular 
education teacher who is a member of the IEP team must participate in 
discussions and decisions about how to modify the general curriculum in 
the regular classroom to ensure the child's involvement and progress in 
the general curriculum and participation in the regular education 
environment.
    Depending upon the specific circumstances, however, it may not be 
necessary for the regular education teacher to participate in 
discussions and decisions regarding, for example, the physical therapy 
needs of the child, if the teacher is not responsible for implementing 
that portion of the child's IEP.
    In determining the extent of the regular education teacher's 
participation at IEP meetings, public agencies and parents should 
discuss and try to reach agreement on whether the child's regular 
education teacher that is a member of the IEP team should be present at 
a particular IEP meeting and, if so, for what period of time. The extent 
to which it would be appropriate for the regular education teacher 
member of the IEP team to participate in IEP meetings must be decided on 
a case-by-case basis.
    25. If a child with a disability attends several regular classes, 
must all of the child's regular education teachers be members of the 
child's IEP team?
    No. The IEP team need not include more than one regular education 
teacher of the child. If the participation of more than one regular 
education teacher would be beneficial to the child's success in school 
(e.g., in terms of enhancing the child's participation in the general 
curriculum), it would be appropriate for them to attend the meeting.
    26. How should a public agency determine which regular education 
teacher and special education teacher will be members of the IEP team 
for a particular child with a disability?
    The regular education teacher who serves as a member of a child's 
IEP team should be a teacher who is, or may be, responsible for 
implementing a portion of the IEP, so that the teacher can participate 
in discussions about how best to teach the child.
    If the child has more than one regular education teacher responsible 
for carrying out a portion of the IEP, the LEA may designate which 
teacher or teachers will serve as IEP team member(s), taking into 
account the best interest of the child.
    In a situation in which not all of the child's regular education 
teachers are members of the child's IEP team, the LEA is strongly 
encouraged to seek input from the teachers who will not be attending. In 
addition, (consistent with Sec.  300.342(b)), the LEA must ensure that 
each regular education teacher (as well as each special education 
teacher, related services provider, and other service provider) of an 
eligible child under this part (1) has access to the child's IEP, and 
(2) is informed of his or her specific responsibilities related to 
implementing the IEP, and of the specific accommodations, modifications 
and supports that must be provided to the child in accordance with the 
IEP.
    In the case of a child whose behavior impedes the learning of the 
child or others, the LEA is encouraged to have a regular education 
teacher or other person knowledgeable about positive behavior strategies 
at the IEP meeting. This is especially important if the regular 
education teacher is expected to carry out portions of the IEP.
    Similarly, the special education teacher or provider of the child 
who is a member of the child's IEP team should be the person who is, or 
will be, responsible for implementing the IEP. If, for example, the 
child's disability is a speech impairment, the special education teacher 
on the IEP team could be the speech-language pathologist.
    27. For a child whose primary disability is a speech impairment, may 
a public agency meet its responsibility under Sec.  300.344(a)(3) to 
ensure that the IEP team includes ``at least one special education 
teacher, or, if appropriate, at least one special education provider of 
the child'' by including a speech-language pathologist on the IEP team?
    Yes, if speech is considered special education under State 
standards. As with other children with disabilities, the IEP team must 
also include at least one of the child's regular education teachers if 
the child is, or may be, participating in the regular education 
environment.
    28. Do parents and public agencies have the option of inviting any 
individual of their choice be participants on their child's IEP team?

[[Page 113]]

    The IEP team may, at the discretion of the parent or the agency, 
include ``other individuals who have knowledge or special expertise 
regarding the child * * *'' (Sec.  300.344(a)(6), italics added). Under 
Sec.  300.344(a)(6), these individuals are members of the IEP team. This 
is a change from prior law, which provided, without qualification, that 
parents or agencies could have other individuals as members of the IEP 
team at the discretion of the parents or agency.
    Under Sec.  300.344(c), the determination as to whether an 
individual has knowledge or special expertise, within the meaning of 
Sec.  300.344(a)(6), shall be made by the parent or public agency who 
has invited the individual to be a member of the IEP team.
    Part B does not provide for including individuals such as 
representatives of teacher organizations as part of an IEP team, unless 
they are included because of knowledge or special expertise regarding 
the child. (Because a representative of a teacher organization would 
generally be concerned with the interests of the teacher rather than the 
interests of the child, and generally would not possess knowledge or 
expertise regarding the child, it generally would be inappropriate for 
such an official to be a member of the IEP team or to otherwise 
participate in an IEP meeting.)
    29. Can parents or public agencies bring their attorneys to IEP 
meetings, and, if so under what circumstances? Are attorney's fees 
available for parents' attorneys if the parents are prevailing parties 
in actions or proceedings brought under Part B?
    Section 300.344(a)(6) authorizes the addition to the IEP team of 
other individuals at the discretion of the parent or the public agency 
only if those other individuals have knowledge or special expertise 
regarding the child. The determination of whether an attorney possesses 
knowledge or special expertise regarding the child would have to be made 
on a case-by-case basis by the parent or public agency inviting the 
attorney to be a member of the team.
    The presence of the agency's attorney could contribute to a 
potentially adversarial atmosphere at the meeting. The same is true with 
regard to the presence of an attorney accompanying the parents at the 
IEP meeting. Even if the attorney possessed knowledge or special 
expertise regarding the child (Sec.  300.344(a)(6)), an attorney's 
presence would have the potential for creating an adversarial atmosphere 
that would not necessarily be in the best interests of the child.
    Therefore, the attendance of attorneys at IEP meetings should be 
strongly discouraged. Further, as specified in Section 615(i)(3)(D)(ii) 
of the Act and Sec.  300.513(c)(2)(ii), Attorneys' fees may not be 
awarded relating to any meeting of the IEP team unless the meeting is 
convened as a result of an administrative proceeding or judicial action, 
or, at the discretion of the State, for a mediation conducted prior to 
the request for a due process hearing.
    30. Must related services personnel attend IEP meetings?
    Although Part B does not expressly require that the IEP team include 
related services personnel as part of the IEP team (Sec.  300.344(a)), 
it is appropriate for those persons to be included if a particular 
related service is to be discussed as part of the IEP meeting. Section 
300.344(a)(6) provides that the IEP team also includes ``at the 
discretion of the parent or the agency, other individuals who have 
knowledge or special expertise regarding the child, including related 
services personnel as appropriate. * * *'' (Italics added.)
    Further, Sec.  300.344(a)(3) requires that the IEP team for each 
child with a disability include ``at least one special education 
teacher, or, if appropriate, at least one special education provider of 
the child * * *'' This requirement can be met by the participation of 
either (1) a special education teacher of the child, or (2) another 
special education provider such as a speech-language pathologist, 
physical or occupational therapist, etc., if the related service 
consists of specially designed instruction and is considered special 
education under the applicable State standard.
    If a child with a disability has an identified need for related 
services, it would be appropriate for the related services personnel to 
attend the meeting or otherwise be involved in developing the IEP. As 
explained in the Committee Reports on the IDEA Amendments of 1997, 
``Related services personnel should be included on the team when a 
particular related service will be discussed at the request of the 
child's parents or the school.'' (H. Rep. No. 105-95, p. 103 (1997); S. 
Rep. No. 105-17, p. 23 (1997)). For example, if the child's evaluation 
indicates the need for a specific related service (e.g., physical 
therapy, occupational therapy, special transportation services, school 
social work services, school health services, or counseling), the agency 
should ensure that a qualified provider of that service either (1) 
attends the IEP meeting, or (2) provides a written recommendation 
concerning the nature, frequency, and amount of service to be provided 
to the child. This written recommendation could be a part of the 
evaluation report.
    A public agency must ensure that all individuals who are necessary 
to develop an IEP that will meet the child's unique needs, and ensure 
the provision of FAPE to the child, participate in the child's IEP 
meeting.
    31. Must the public agency ensure that all services specified in a 
child's IEP are provided?
    Yes. The public agency must ensure that all services set forth in 
the child's IEP are provided, consistent with the child's needs as

[[Page 114]]

identified in the IEP. The agency may provide each of those services 
directly, through its own staff resources; indirectly, by contracting 
with another public or private agency; or through other arrangements. In 
providing the services, the agency may use whatever State, local, 
Federal, and private sources of support are available for those purposes 
(see Sec.  300.301(a)); but the services must be at no cost to the 
parents, and the public agency remains responsible for ensuring that the 
IEP services are provided in a manner that appropriately meets the 
student's needs as specified in the IEP. The SEA and responsible public 
agency may not allow the failure of another agency to provide service(s) 
described in the child's IEP to deny or delay the provision of FAPE to 
the child. (See Sec.  300.142, Methods of ensuring services.)
    32. Is it permissible for an agency to have the IEP completed before 
the IEP meeting begins?
    No. Agency staff may come to an IEP meeting prepared with evaluation 
findings and proposed recommendations regarding IEP content, but the 
agency must make it clear to the parents at the outset of the meeting 
that the services proposed by the agency are only recommendations for 
review and discussion with the parents. Parents have the right to bring 
questions, concerns, and recommendations to an IEP meeting as part of a 
full discussion, of the child's needs and the services to be provided to 
meet those needs before the IEP is finalized.
    Public agencies must ensure that, if agency personnel bring drafts 
of some or all of the IEP content to the IEP meeting, there is a full 
discussion with the child's parents, before the child's IEP is 
finalized, regarding drafted content and the child's needs and the 
services to be provided to meet those needs.
    33. Must a public agency include transportation in a child's IEP as 
a related service?
    As with other related services, a public agency must provide 
transportation as a related service if it is required to assist the 
disabled child to benefit from special education. (This includes 
transporting a preschool-aged child to the site at which the public 
agency provides special education and related services to the child, if 
that site is different from the site at which the child receives other 
preschool or day care services.)
    In determining whether to include transportation in a child's IEP, 
and whether the child needs to receive transportation as a related 
service, it would be appropriate to have at the IEP meeting a person 
with expertise in that area. In making this determination, the IEP team 
must consider how the child's disability affects the child's need for 
transportation, including determining whether the child's disability 
prevents the child from using the same transportation provided to 
nondisabled children, or from getting to school in the same manner as 
nondisabled children.
    The public agency must ensure that any transportation service 
included in a child's IEP as a related service is provided at public 
expense and at no cost to the parents, and that the child's IEP 
describes the transportation arrangement.
    Even if a child's IEP team determines that the child does not 
require transportation as a related service, Section 504 of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, requires that the child receive 
the same transportation provided to nondisabled children. If a public 
agency transports nondisabled children, it must transport disabled 
children under the same terms and conditions. However, if a child's IEP 
team determines that the child does not need transportation as a related 
service, and the public agency transports only those children whose IEPs 
specify transportation as a related service, and does not transport 
nondisabled children, the public agency would not be required to provide 
transportation to a disabled child.
    It should be assumed that most children with disabilities receive 
the same transportation services as nondisabled children. For some 
children with disabilities, integrated transportation may be achieved by 
providing needed accommodations such as lifts and other equipment 
adaptations on regular school transportation vehicles.
    34. Must a public agency provide related services that are required 
to assist a child with a disability to benefit from special education, 
whether or not those services are included in the list of related 
services in Sec.  300.24?
    The list of related services is not exhaustive and may include other 
developmental, corrective, or supportive services if they are required 
to assist a child with a disability to benefit from special education. 
This could, depending upon the unique needs of a child, include such 
services as nutritional services or service coordination.
    These determinations must be made on an individual basis by each 
child's IEP team.
    35. Must the IEP specify the amount of services or may it simply 
list the services to be provided?
    The amount of services to be provided must be stated in the IEP, so 
that the level of the agency's commitment of resources will be clear to 
parents and other IEP team members (Sec.  300.347(a)(6)). The amount of 
time to be committed to each of the various services to be provided must 
be (1) appropriate to the specific service, and (2) stated in the IEP in 
a manner that is clear to all who are involved in both the development 
and implementation of the IEP.
    The amount of a special education or related service to be provided 
to a child may be stated in the IEP as a range (e.g., speech therapy to 
be provided three times per week

[[Page 115]]

for 30-45 minutes per session) only if the IEP team determines that 
stating the amount of services as a range is necessary to meet the 
unique needs of the child. For example, it would be appropriate for the 
IEP to specify, based upon the IEP team's determination of the student's 
unique needs, that particular services are needed only under specific 
circumstances, such as the occurrence of a seizure or of a particular 
behavior. A range may not be used because of personnel shortages or 
uncertainty regarding the availability of staff.
    36. Under what circumstances is a public agency required to permit a 
child with a disability to use a school-purchased assistive technology 
device in the child's home or in another setting?
    Each child's IEP team must consider the child's need for assistive 
technology (AT) in the development of the child's IEP (Sec.  
300.346(a)(2)(v)); and the nature and extent of the AT devices and 
services to be provided to the child must be reflected in the child's 
IEP (Sec.  300.346(c)).
    A public agency must permit a child to use school-purchased 
assistive technology devices at home or in other settings, if the IEP 
team determines that the child needs access to those devices in 
nonschool settings in order to receive FAPE (to complete homework, for 
example).
    Any assistive technology devices that are necessary to ensure FAPE 
must be provided at no cost to the parents, and the parents cannot be 
charged for normal use, wear and tear. However, while ownership of the 
devices in these circumstances would remain with the public agency, 
State law, rather than Part B, generally would govern whether parents 
are liable for loss, theft, or damage due to negligence or misuse of 
publicly owned equipment used at home or in other settings in accordance 
with a child's IEP.
    37. Can the IEP team also function as the group making the placement 
decision for a child with a disability?
    Yes, a public agency may use the IEP team to make the placement 
decision for a child, so long as the group making the placement decision 
meets the requirements of Sec. Sec.  300.552 and 300.501(c), which 
requires that the placement decision be made by a group of persons, 
including the parents, and other persons knowledgeable about the child, 
the meaning of the evaluation data, and the placement options.
    38. If a child's IEP includes behavioral strategies to address a 
particular behavior, can a child ever be suspended for engaging in that 
behavior?
    If a child's behavior impedes his or her learning or that of others, 
the IEP team, in developing the child's IEP, must consider, if 
appropriate, development of strategies, including positive behavioral 
interventions, strategies and supports to address that behavior, 
consistent with Sec.  300.346(a)(2)(i). This means that in most cases in 
which a child's behavior that impedes his or her learning or that of 
others is, or can be readily anticipated to be, repetitive, proper 
development of the child's IEP will include the development of 
strategies, including positive behavioral interventions, strategies and 
supports to address that behavior. See Sec.  300.346(c). This includes 
behavior that could violate a school code of conduct. A failure to, if 
appropriate, consider and address these behaviors in developing and 
implementing the child's IEP would constitute a denial of FAPE to the 
child. Of course, in appropriate circumstances, the IEP team, which 
includes the child's parents, might determine that the child's 
behavioral intervention plan includes specific regular or alternative 
disciplinary measures, such as denial of certain privileges or short 
suspensions, that would result from particular infractions of school 
rules, along with positive behavior intervention strategies and 
supports, as a part of a comprehensive plan to address the child's 
behavior. Of course, if short suspensions that are included in a child's 
IEP are being implemented in a manner that denies the child access to 
the ability to progress in the educational program, the child would be 
denied FAPE.
    Whether other disciplinary measures, including suspension, are ever 
appropriate for behavior that is addressed in a child's IEP will have to 
be determined on a case by case basis in light of the particular 
circumstances of that incident. However, school personnel may not use 
their ability to suspend a child for 10 days or less at a time on 
multiple occasions in a school year as a means of avoiding appropriately 
considering and addressing the child's behavior as a part of providing 
FAPE to the child.
    39. If a child's behavior in the regular classroom, even with 
appropriate interventions, would significantly impair the learning of 
others, can the group that makes the placement decision determine that 
placement in the regular classroom is inappropriate for that child?
    The IEP team, in developing the IEP, is required to consider, when 
appropriate, strategies, including positive behavioral interventions, 
strategies and supports to address the behavior of a child with a 
disability whose behavior impedes his or her learning or that of others. 
If the IEP team determines that such supports, strategies or 
interventions are necessary to address the behavior of the child, those 
services must be included in the child's IEP. These provisions are 
designed to foster increased participation of children with disabilities 
in regular education environments or other less restrictive 
environments, not to serve as a basis for placing children with 
disabilities in more restrictive settings.

[[Page 116]]

    The determination of appropriate placement for a child whose 
behavior is interfering with the education of others requires careful 
consideration of whether the child can appropriately function in the 
regular classroom if provided appropriate behavioral supports, 
strategies and interventions. If the child can appropriately function in 
the regular classroom with appropriate behavioral supports, strategies 
or interventions, placement in a more restrictive environment would be 
inconsistent with the least restrictive environment provisions of the 
IDEA. If the child's behavior in the regular classroom, even with the 
provision of appropriate behavioral supports, strategies or 
interventions, would significantly impair the learning of others, that 
placement would not meet his or her needs and would not be appropriate 
for that child.
    40. May school personnel during a school year implement more than 
one short-term removal of a child with disabilities from his or her 
classroom or school for misconduct?
    Yes. Under Sec.  300.520(a)(1), school personnel may order removal 
of a child with a disability from the child's current placement for not 
more than 10 consecutive school days for any violation of school rules, 
and additional removals of not more than 10 consecutive school days in 
that same school year for separate incidents of misconduct, as long as 
these removals do not constitute a change of placement under Sec.  
300.519(b). However, these removals are permitted only to the extent 
they are consistent with discipline that is applied to children without 
disabilities. Also, school personnel should be aware of constitutional 
due process protections that apply to suspensions of all children. Goss 
v. Lopez, 419 U.S. 565 (1975). Section 300.121(d) addresses the extent 
of the obligation to provide services after a child with a disability 
has been removed from his or her current placement for more than 10 
school days in the same school year.

[64 FR 34049, June 24, 1999]

  Appendix C to Part 300;--Implementation of the 20 Percebt Rule Under 
                              Sec.  300.233

    This appendix is intended to assist States and LEAs to implement the 
``20 percent rule'' under Part B (section 613(a)(2)(C)) of the 
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), and, specifically, 
the regulation implementing that provision in Sec.  300.233. The 
purposes of the appendix are to--(1) provide background information 
about the 20 percent rule and its intended effect, including specifying 
which funds under Part B of the Act are covered by the provision (as 
described in Sec.  300.233), and the basis for the Department's

[[Page 169]]

decision regarding those funds; and (2) include examples showing how the 
20 percent rule would apply in several situations.

                              A. Background

    1. Purpose of 20 Percent Rule. The IDEA Amendments of 1997 (Pub. L. 
105-17) added a provision related to the permissive treatment of a 
portion of Part B funds by LEAs for maintenance of effort and non-
supplanting purposes in certain fiscal years (see section 613(a)(2)(C) 
of the Act and Sec.  300.233). Under that provision, for any fiscal year 
(FY) for which the appropriation for section 611 of IDEA exceeds $4.1 
billion, an LEA may treat as local funds, for maintenance of effort and 
non-supplanting purposes, up to 20 percent of the amount it receives 
that exceeds the amount it received under Part B during the prior year.
    Thus, under Sec.  300.233, an LEA is able to meet the maintenance of 
effort requirement of Sec.  300.231 and the non-supplanting requirement 
of Sec.  300.230(c) even though it reduces the amount it spends of other 
local or local and State funds, as the case may be, by an amount equal 
to the amount of Federal funds that may be treated as local funds.
    2. 20 Percent Rule Applies Only to LEA Subgrants. Following 
enactment of the IDEA Amendments of 1997 (and publication of Part B 
regulations on March 12, 1999), State and local educational agency 
officials stated that it is not clear from the Act and regulations 
whether the funds affected by the 20 percent rule are only those that an 
LEA receives through statutory subgrants under section 611(g), or 
whether the provision also applies to other Part B funding sources 
(i.e., subgrants to LEAs for capacity-building and improvement under 
section 611(f)(4); other funds the SEA may provide to LEAs under section 
611(f); or funds provided under section 619 (Preschool Grants program)).
    Further, because section 613(a)(2)(C) refers to an amount of funds 
that an LEA ``receives'' in one fiscal year compared to the amount it 
``received'' in the prior fiscal year (and because agencies may, at any 
one point in time, be using funds appropriated in several Federal fiscal 
years), agency officials were uncertain as to how to determine that an 
LEA had ``received'' Federal funds.
    Because the statute and regulations were not sufficiently clear with 
respect to which precise funds are affected by the 20 percent rule, this 
could have resulted in the provision being interpreted and applied 
differently from LEA to LEA. If that situation were to occur, it could 
result in a significant increase in the number of audit exceptions 
against LEAs.
    Given the confusion about which funding sources are affected by the 
20 percent rule, there was a critical need to set out in the regulations 
a clear interpretation of section 613(a)(2)(C) in order to support its 
consistent application across LEAs and States, and to reduce the 
potential for audit exceptions. Thus, on June 10, 2000, the Department 
published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) regarding this 
provision (65 FR 30314). The NPRM stated that--
    In light of the statutory structure for distribution of Federal 
funds to LEAs, we believe that the most reasonable interpretation is to 
apply that provision only to subgrants to LEAs under section 611(g) of 
the Act (Sec.  300.712 of the regulations) from funds appropriated from 
one Federal fiscal year compared to funds appropriated for the prior 
Federal fiscal year. (Emphasis added.)
    Thus, the NPRM proposed to exclude the other Federal funds under 
Part B of the Act (i.e., Subgrants to LEAs for capacity-building and 
improvement under section 611(f)(4) (Sec.  300.622); other funds the SEA 
may provide to LEAs under section 611(f) (Sec.  300.602); and preschool 
grant funds under section 619 (34 CFR part 301)) from the funds that 
could be treated as local funds. The reasons for excluding these other 
Part B funds were stated in the NPRM, as follows:
    [sbull] If IDEA funds that States have the authority to provide to 
LEAs on a discretionary basis (such as those identified in the preceding 
paragraph) are included in the 20 percent calculation, it would result 
in some LEAs receiving a proportionately greater benefit from this 
provision than other LEAs, based on receipt of funds that may be 
earmarked for a specific, time-limited purpose. This would lead to 
inequitable results of the Sec.  300.233 exception across LEAs in a 
State.
    [sbull] Including section 619 formula grant funds (34 CFR part 301) 
in the calculation does not appear to be justified as the ``trigger'' 
appropriation amount applies only with respect to the amount 
appropriated under section 611.
    The Department subsequently determined that the position taken in 
the NPRM (that the provision under Sec.  300.233 should apply only to 
LEA subgrant funds under section 611(g) of the Act) is the most 
appropriate and reasonable position to follow in implementing the 20 
percent rule. Therefore, the proposed provision in Sec.  300.233(a)(1) 
was retained, without change, in the final regulations.

                  B. Application of the 20 percent rule

         1. Examples Related to Implementing the 20 percent rule

    The following are examples showing how the 20 percent provision 
would apply under several situations:

    [sbull] Example 1: An LEA receives $100,000 in Federal LEA Subgrant 
funds under section 611(g) of the Act from the appropriation for one 
fiscal year (FY-1), and $120,000 in section 611(g) funds from the 
appropriation for the following fiscal year (FY-2). The LEA may

[[Page 170]]

spend and treat as local funds up to 20 percent of the $20,000 in 
section 611(g) funds it receives from FY-2 (i.e., up to $4,000), since 
this is the amount that exceeds the amount it received from the prior 
year.
    [sbull] Example 1-A: In Example 1, an LEA in FY-2 is uncertain 
whether to exercise its option to treat as local funds during FY-2 up to 
$4,000 of its section 611(g) funds received from FY-2, and wishes to 
wait until the carry-over year to make a decision. If the LEA decides to 
exercise its option during the carry-over period regarding the $4,000 
from the FY-2 appropriation, it could do so as long as those funds are 
used within the carry-over period for FY-2.
    [sbull] Example 1-B: An LEA receives $100,000 in section 611(g) 
funds from FY-1, $120,000 from FY-2 and $140,000 from FY-3. The LEA may 
spend and treat as local funds up to 20 percent of the $20,000 from FY-2 
funds and $20,000 of FY-3 funds (i.e., up to $4,000 for each year). 
Thus, if its FY-2 funds are not used until FY-3, and the LEA so chooses, 
it may spend and treat as local funds during FY-3 a total of up to 
$8,000 in section 611(g) funds (i.e., $4,000 from FY-2 and $4,000 from 
FY-3), provided those funds are obligated by the end of FY-3.
    [sbull] Example 2: An LEA from one fiscal year (FY-1) receives 
$100,000 in section 611(g) funds and $20,000 in SEA discretionary funds 
under section 611(f) of the Act; and from the following year (FY-2) 
receives $120,000 in section 611(g) funds, but does not receive any 
funds under section 611(f). The LEA may spend and treat up to 20 percent 
of the $20,000 in section 611(g) funds it receives from FY-2 (i.e. up to 
$4,000), since $20,000 is the amount of section 611(g) funds that 
exceeds the amount it received from FY-1.
    [sbull] Example 3: An LEA had all of its section 611(g) funds 
($100,000) withheld from one fiscal year (FY-1); but in the next fiscal 
year (FY-2), the LEA received a total of $220,000 in section 611(g) 
funds (i.e., $100,000 from FY-1, plus $120,000 from FY-2). Because the 
LEA would have been entitled to $100,000 in FY-1, the LEA may spend and 
treat as local funds up to 20 percent of the $20,000 from FY-2 that 
exceeded the FY-1 allotment (i.e., up to $4,000).
    [sbull] Example 4: An LEA received $100,000 under section 611(g) 
from one fiscal year (FY-1), and would have received $120,000 in section 
611(g) funds for the next fiscal year (FY-2); but the LEA has had all of 
its section 611(g) funds withheld in FY-2 because of a finding of 
noncompliance under Sec.  300.197 or Sec.  300.587. The LEA would have 
no section 611(g) funds that could be spent or treated as local funds 
until those funds are released.
    [sbull] Example 4-A: In example 4, the SEA subsequently determines 
that the LEA is in compliance, and releases the FY-2 funds to the LEA 
later in that fiscal year. The LEA could then spend and treat as local 
funds up to 20 percent of the $20,000 that exceeds the amount it 
received in FY-1 (i.e., up to $4,000). Those funds could be used by the 
LEA for the remainder of FY-2 and through the end of the carry-over 
period for FY-2 funding.

2. Auditing for Compliance with Sec.  300.231 and the 20 percent rule in 
                              Sec.  300.233

    The following provides guidance for use by auditors in determining 
if LEAs are in compliance with the maintenance of effort requirement in 
Sec.  300.231 and the 20 percent rule in Sec.  300.233:
    a. Meeting the Maintenance of Effort Requirement. In order to be 
eligible to receive an IDEA-Part B subgrant in any particular fiscal 
year, an LEA is required to demonstrate that it has budgeted an amount 
of State and local funds, or just local funds, to be spent on special 
education and related services that equals or exceeds (on either an 
aggregate or per capita basis) the amount of those funds spent by the 
LEA for those purposes in the prior fiscal year, or in the most recent 
prior fiscal year for which information is available. 34 CFR 300.231.
    b. Auditing Compliance with Sec.  300.231. Auditors, in determining 
if an LEA has complied with Sec.  300.231 in any particular fiscal year, 
review the actual level of expenditures of State and local funds, or 
just local funds, on special education and related services for the year 
in question and the prior year. For example, consider an LEA that, in 
the LEA's FY-1, spent a total of $1,000,000 of local funds on special 
education and related services to serve 100 students with disabilities. 
(For this discussion, assume that the LEA does not receive any State 
funds for any year for special education and related services.) An 
auditor, in trying to determine if the LEA, in its FY-2, had complied 
with Sec.  300.231, would review the LEA's expenditure of local funds on 
special education and related services. If, in the LEA's FY-2, the LEA 
served 100 students with disabilities and spent $1,000,000 or more in 
local funds on special education and related services, it would have met 
the requirements of Sec.  300.231 for FY-2.
    c. Application of the 20 percent rule to Sec.  300.231. If the LEA 
in the preceding example had spent only $996,000 of local funds on 
special education and related services for its 100 students with 
disabilities in its FY-2 (not counting any section 611(g) subgrant funds 
that could be considered local funds under the 20 percent rule), then it 
would have failed to meet its obligation under Sec.  300.231, and an 
auditor would question $4,000 of the LEA's IDEA-Part B subgrant 
expenditures in that year.
    This questioned cost, however, could be avoided, if the LEA had 
available, and spent, $4,000 of Federal funds under the 20 percent rule 
during its FY-2. These funds may be available from a variety of sources 
(see Examples in paragraph 1). If, as described in

[[Page 171]]

Example 1 of paragraph 1 the LEA had received from the Federal FY-2 
appropriation, a section 611(g) subgrant that was $20,000 greater than 
the subgrant it received from the Federal FY-1 appropriation, then up to 
$4,000 of that subgrant could be treated as local funds. The LEA, 
however, would have to spend at least $4,000 of its Federal FY-2 section 
611(g) subgrant during its FY-2 in order for those funds to count as 
part of its local expenditures for that year for purposes of Sec.  
300.231.
    In this example, if the LEA had carried over all of its Federal FY-2 
section 611(g) subgrant to the LEA's FY-3 (and thus did not spend any of 
those funds during its FY-2), then none of the section 611(g) subgrant 
funds subject to the 20 percent rule could be considered as local funds 
for purposes of determining compliance with Sec.  300.231. (The reason 
for this is that auditors, in determining an LEA's compliance with Sec.  
300.231, examine State and local, or local funds the LEA actually spent 
on special education and related services, and not those funds that the 
LEA could, but did not, spend for those purposes.)
    If the LEA, in its FY-2, spent $4,000 of its Federal FY-2 section 
611(g) subgrant, then the LEA could count those expenditures and bring 
itself into compliance with Sec.  300.231 (i.e., $996,000 of the LEA's 
own local funds spent on special education and related services plus the 
$4,000 of Federal FY-2 section 611(g) funds that can be counted as local 
funds equals a total of $1,000,000 of local expenditures on special 
education in its FY-2--the amount of local expenditures needed to comply 
with Sec.  300.231). However, if the LEA elected to take this step, it 
could not count any of the Federal FY-2 section 611(g) subgrant funds 
that it will spend in its FY-3 as local funds.
    If the LEA, in its FY-2, spent only $3,000 of its Federal FY-2 
section 611(g) subgrant funds, then those funds could be counted by the 
LEA as local funds in calculating its compliance with Sec.  300.231 for 
its FY-2. If the remaining $1,000 of Federal FY-2 funds available to be 
considered local funds were spent in the LEA's FY-3, those funds could 
be considered in determining the LEA's compliance with Sec.  300.231 for 
its FY-3. (Note, However, that if in its FY-2 the LEA had only spent 
$996,000 of local funds and $3,000 of its Federal funds, it would not 
have met the requirements of Sec.  300.231. In this case the auditor 
would have $1,000 of questioned costs ($1,000,000 - [$996,000 + $3,000] 
= $1,000) for FY-2).

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1419(c)(2)(A))


<R05>
Sec.  301.22  Limitation.

    (a) Notwithstanding Sec.  301.21, allocations under that section are 
subject to the following:
    (1) No State's allocation may be less than its allocation for the 
preceding fiscal year.
    (2) No State's allocation may be less than the greatest of--
    (i) The sum of--
    (A) The amount it received for fiscal year 1997; and
    (B) One-third of one percent of the amount by which the amount 
appropriated under section 619(j) of the Act exceeds the amount 
appropriated under section 619 of the Act for fiscal year 1997;
    (ii) The sum of--
    (A) The amount it received for the preceding fiscal year; and
    (B) That amount multiplied by the percentage by which the increase 
in the funds appropriated from the preceding fiscal year exceeds 1.5 
percent; or
    (iii) The sum of--
    (A) The amount it received for the preceding fiscal year; and
    (B) That amount multiplied by 90 percent of the percentage increase 
in the amount appropriated from the preceding fiscal year.
    (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(2) of this section, no State's 
allocation under Sec.  301.21 may exceed the sum of--
    (1) The amount it received for the preceding fiscal year; and

percentage increase in the amount appropriated.
    (c) If the amount available for allocation to States under Sec.  
301.21 and paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section is insufficient to pay 
those allocations in full, the Secretary ratably reduces those 
allocations, subject to paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1419(c)(2)(B) and (C))


<R05>

Act for the preceding fiscal year, those allocations are calculated as 
follows:
    (a) If the amount available for allocations is greater than the 
amount allocated to the States for fiscal year 1997, each State is 
allocated the sum of--
    (1) The amount it received for fiscal year 1997; and
    (2) An amount that bears the same relation to any remaining funds as 
the increase the State received for the preceding fiscal year over 
fiscal year 1997

[[Page 174]]

bears to the total of those increases for all States.
    (b)(1) If the amount available for allocations is equal to the 
amount allocated to the States for fiscal year 1997, each State is 
allocated the amount it received for that year.
    (2) If the amount available is less than the amount allocated to 
States for fiscal year 1997, the Secretary allocates amounts equal to 
the allocations for fiscal year 1997, ratably reduced.

the SEA an amount that is 25 percent of the amount the State received 
under section 619 of the Act for fiscal year 1997, cumulatively adjusted 
by the Secretary for each succeeding fiscal year by the lesser of--
    (1) The percentage increase, if any, from the preceding fiscal year 
in the State's allocation under section 619 of the Act; or
    (2) The rate of inflation, as measured by the percentage increase, 
if any, from the preceding fiscal year in the Consumer Price Index For

<R05>
Sec.  301.25  Use of funds for State administration.

    (a) For the purpose of administering section 619 of the Act 
(including the coordination of activities under Part B of the Act with, 
and providing technical assistance to, other programs that provide 
services to children with disabilities), each State may use not more 
than twenty percent of the maximum amount it may retain under Sec.  
301.24 for any fiscal year.
    (b) Funds described in paragraph (a) of this section may also be 
used for the administration of part C of the Act, if the SEA is the lead 
agency for the State under that part.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1419(e))


<R05>
Sec.  301.26  Use of State agency allocations.

    Each State shall use any funds it retains under Sec.  301.24 and 
does not use for administration under Sec.  301.25 for any of the 
following:
    (a) Support services (including establishing and implementing the 
mediation process required by section 615(e) of the Act), which may 
benefit children with disabilities younger than 3 or older than 5 as 
long as those services also benefit children with disabilities aged 3 
through 5.
    (b) Direct services for children eligible for services under section 
619 of the Act.
    (c) Developing a State improvement plan under subpart 1 of part D of

goals established by the State under section 612(a)(16) of the Act and 
to support implementation of the State improvement plan under subpart 1 
of part D of the Act if the State receives funds under that subpart.
    (e) Supplementing other funds used to develop and implement a 
Statewide coordinated services system designed to improve results for 
children and families, including children with disabilities and their 
families, but not to exceed one percent of the amount received by the 
State under section 619 of the Act for a fiscal year.

<R04>
      Subpart D--Allocation of Funds to Local Educational Agencies


<R05>
Sec.  301.30  Subgrants to local educational agencies.

    Each State that receives a grant under section 619 of the Act for 
any fiscal year shall distribute any funds it does not retain under 
Sec.  301.24 to local educational agencies in the State that have 
established their eligibility under section 613 of the Act.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1419(g)(1))

[[Page 175]]


<R05>
Sec.  301.31  Allocations to local educational agencies.

    (a) Base payments. The State shall first award each agency described 
in Sec.  301.30 the amount that agency would have received under section 
619 of the Act for fiscal year 1997 if the State had distributed 75 
percent of its grant for that year under section 619(c)(3), as then in 
effect.
    (b) Base payment adjustments. For fiscal year 1998 and beyond--
    (1) If a new LEA is created, the State shall divide the base 
allocation determined under paragraph (a) of this section for the LEAs 
that would have been responsible for serving children with disabilities 
now being served by the new LEA, among the new LEA and affected LEAs 
based on the relative numbers of children with disabilities ages 3 
through 5 currently provided special education by each of the LEAs;
    (2) If one or more LEAs are combined into a single new LEA, the 
State shall combine the base allocations of the merged LEAs; and
    (3) If for two or more LEAs, geographic boundaries or administrative 
responsibility for providing services to children with disabilities ages 
3 through 5 changes, the base allocations of affected LEAs shall be 
redistributed among affected LEAs based on the relative numbers of 
children with disabilities ages 3 through 5 currently provided special 
education by each affected LEA.
    (c) Allocation of remaining funds. After making allocations under 
paragraph (a) of this section, the State shall--
    (1) Allocate 85 percent of any remaining funds to those agencies on 
the basis of the relative numbers of children enrolled in public and 
private elementary and secondary schools within the agency's 
jurisdiction; and
    (2) Allocate 15 percent of those remaining funds to those agencies 
in accordance with their relative numbers of children living in poverty, 
as determined by the SEA.
    (3) For the purpose of making grants under this section, States must 
apply on a uniform basis across all LEAs the best data that are 
available to them on the numbers of children enrolled in public and 
private elementary and secondary schools and the numbers of children 
living in poverty.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1419(g)(1))


<R05>
Sec.  301.32  Reallocation of local education agency funds.

    (a) If a SEA determines that an LEA is adequately providing a free 
appropriate public education to all children with disabilities aged 3

Sec.  303.13  Health services.

    (a) As used in this part, health services means services necessary 
to enable a child to benefit from the other early intervention services 
under this part during the time that the child is receiving the other 
early intervention services.
    (b) The term includes--
    (1) Such services as clean intermittent catheterization, 
tracheostomy care, tube feeding, the changing of dressings or colostomy 
collection bags, and other health services; and

[[Page 183]]

    (2) Consultation by physicians with other service providers 
concerning the special health care needs of eligible children that will 
need to be addressed in the course of providing other early intervention 
services.
    (c) The term does not include the following:
    (1) Services that are--
    (i) Surgical in nature (such as cleft palate surgery, surgery for 
club foot, or the shunting of hydrocephalus); or
    (ii) Purely medical in nature (such as hospitalization for 
management of congenital heart ailments, or the prescribing of medicine 
or drugs for any purpose).
    (2) Devices necessary to control or treat a medical condition.
    (3) Medical-health services (such as immunizations and regular 
``well-baby'' care) that are routinely recommended for all children.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1432(4))
    Note: The definition in this section distinguishes between the 
health services that are required under this part and the medical-health 
services that are not required. The IFSP requirements in subpart D of 
this part provide that, to the extent appropriate, these other medical-
health services are to be included in the IFSP, along with the funding 
sources to be used in paying for the services or the steps that will be 
taken to secure the services through public or private sources. 
Identifying these services in the IFSP does not impose an obligation to 
provide the services if they are otherwise not required to be provided 
under this part. (See Sec.  303.344(e) and the note 3 following that 
section.)


<R05>
Sec.  303.14  IFSP.

    As used in this part, IFSP means the individualized family service 
plan, as that term is defined in Sec.  303.340(b).

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1436)


<R05>
Sec.  303.15  Include; including.

    As used in this part, include or including means that the items 
named are not all of the possible items that are covered whether like or 
unlike the ones named.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1431-1445)


<R05>
Sec.  303.16  Infants and toddlers with disabilities.

    (a) As used in this part, infants and toddlers with disabilities 
means individuals from birth through age two who need early intervention 
services because they--
    (1) Are experiencing developmental delays, as measured by 
appropriate diagnostic instruments and procedures, in one or more of the 
following areas:
    (i) Cognitive development.
    (ii) Physical development, including vision and hearing.
    (iii) Communication development.
    (iv) Social or emotional development.
    (v) Adaptive development; or
    (2) Have a diagnosed physical or mental condition that has a high 
probability of resulting in developmental delay.
    (b) The term may also include, at a State's discretion, children 
from birth through age two who are at risk of having substantial 
developmental delays if early intervention services are not provided.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1432(5))
    Note 1: The phrase ``a diagnosed physical or mental condition that 
has a high probability of resulting in developmental delay,'' as used in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section, applies to a condition if it typically 
results in developmental delay. Examples of these conditions include 
chromosomal abnormalities; genetic or congenital disorders; severe 
sensory impairments, including hearing and vision; inborn errors of 
metabolism; disorders reflecting disturbance of the development of the 
nervous system; congenital infections; disorders secondary to exposure 
to toxic substances, including fetal alcohol syndrome; and severe 
attachment disorders.
    Note 2: With respect to paragraph (b) of this section, children who 
are at risk may be eligible under this part if a State elects to extend 
services to that population, even though they have not been identified 
as disabled.
    Under this provision, States have the authority to define who would 
be ``at risk of having substantial developmental delays if early 
intervention services are not provided.'' In defining the ``at risk'' 
population, States may include well-known biological and environmental 
factors that can be identified and that place infants and toddlers ``at 
risk'' for developmental delay. Commonly cited factors include low birth 
weight, respiratory distress as a newborn, lack of oxygen, brain 
hemorrhage, infection, nutritional deprivation, and a history of abuse 
or neglect. It should be noted that ``at risk'' factors do not predict 
the presence of a barrier to development, but they may indicate children 
who are at higher risk of developmental delay than children without 
these problems.

[[Page 184]]


<R05>
Sec.  303.17  Multidisciplinary.

    As used in this part, multidisciplinary means the involvement of two 
or more disciplines or professions in the provision of integrated and 
coordinated services, including evaluation and assessment activities in

or stepparent with whom the child lives, or a person who is legally 
responsible for the child's welfare); or
    (4) A surrogate parent who has been assigned in accordance with 
Sec.  303.406.
    (b) Foster parent. Unless State law prohibits a foster parent from 
acting as a parent, a State may allow a foster parent to act as a parent 
under Part C of the Act if--
    (1) The natural parents' authority to make the decisions required of 
parents under the Act has been extinguished under State law; and
    (2) The foster parent--
    (i) Has an ongoing, long-term parental relationship with the child;
    (ii) Is willing to make the decisions required of parents under the 
Act; and
    (iii) Has no interest that would conflict with the interests of the 
child.

written documents that represent the State's position concerning any 
matter covered under this part.
    (b) State policies include--
    (1) A State's commitment to maintain the statewide system (see Sec.  
303.140);
    (2) A State's eligibility criteria and procedures (see Sec.  
303.300);
    (3) A statement that, consistent with Sec.  303.520(b), provides 
that services under this part will be provided at no cost to parents, 
except where a system of payments is provided for under Federal or State 
law.
    (4) A State's standards for personnel who provide services to 
children eligible under this part (see Sec.  303.361);
    (5) A State's position and procedures related to contracting or 
making other arrangements with service providers under subpart F of this 
part; and
    (6) Other positions that the State has adopted related to 
implementing any of the other requirements under this part.

    Note: These regulations contain the following provisions relating to 
a State's responsibility to ensure that personnel are qualified to 
provide early intervention services:


[[Page 185]]


    1. Section 303.12(a)(4) provides that early intervention services 
must meet State standards. This provision implements a requirement that 
is similar to a longstanding provision under part B of the Act (i.e., 
that the State educational agency establish standards and ensure that 
those standards are currently met for all programs providing special 
education and related services).
    2. Section 303.12(a)(3)(ii) provides that early intervention 
services must be provided by qualified personnel.
    3. Section 303.361(b) requires statewide systems to have policies 
and procedures relating to personnel standards.

<R05>
Sec.  303.23  Service coordination (case management).

    (a) General. (1) As used in this part, except in Sec.  
303.12(d)(11), service coordination means the activities carried out by 
a service coordinator to assist and enable a child eligible under this 
part and the child's family to receive the rights, procedural 
safeguards, and services that are authorized to be provided under the 
State's early intervention program.
    (2) Each child eligible under this part and the child's family must 
be provided with one service coordinator who is responsible for--
    (i) Coordinating all services across agency lines; and
    (ii) Serving as the single point of contact in helping parents to 
obtain the services and assistance they need.
    (3) Service coordination is an active, ongoing process that 
involves--
    (i) Assisting parents of eligible children in gaining access to the 
early intervention services and other services identified in the 
individualized family service plan;
    (ii) Coordinating the provision of early intervention services and 
other services (such as medical services for other than diagnostic and 
evaluation purposes) that the child needs or is being provided;
    (iii) Facilitating the timely delivery of available services; and
    (iv) Continuously seeking the appropriate services and situations 
necessary to benefit the development of each child being served for the 
duration of the child's eligibility.
    (b) Specific service coordination activities. Service coordination

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1432(4))
    Note 1: If States have existing service coordination systems, the 
States may use or adapt those systems, so long as they are consistent 
with the requirements of this part.
    Note 2: The legislative history of the 1991 amendments to the Act 
indicates that the use of the term ``service coordination'' was not 
intended to affect the authority to seek reimbursement for services 
provided under Medicaid or any other legislation that makes

as the Secretary may find necessary to assure compliance with the

Sec.  303.122  Control of funds and property.

    The statement must provide assurance satisfactory to the Secretary 
that--
    (a) The control of funds provided under this part, and title to 
property acquired with those funds, will be in a public agency for the 
uses and purposes provided in this part; and
    (b) A public agency will administer the funds and property.

<R05>
Sec.  303.123  Prohibition against commingling.

    The statement must include an assurance satisfactory to the 
Secretary that funds made available under this part will not be 
commingled with State funds.

(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 
1820-0550)

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1437(b)(5)(A))
    Note: As used in this part, commingle means depositing or recording 
funds in a general account without the ability to identify each specific 
source of funds for any expenditure. Under that general definition, it 
is clear that commingling is prohibited. However, to the extent that the 
funds from each of a series of Federal, State, local, and private 
funding sources can be identified--with a clear audit trail for each 
source--it is appropriate for those funds to be consolidated for 
carrying out a common purpose. In fact, a State may find it essential to 
set out a funding plan that incorporates, and accounts for, all sources 
of funds that can be targeted on a given activity or function related to 
the State's early intervention program.
    Thus, the assurance in this section is satisfied by the use of an

    (1) Describing, for each of the areas listed in Sec.  303.16(a)(1), 
the procedures, including the use of informed clinical opinion, that 
will be used to measure a child's development; and
    (2) Stating the levels of functioning or other criteria that 
constitute a developmental delay in each of those areas.
    (b) The State shall describe the criteria and procedures, including 
the use of informed clinical opinion, that will

[[Page 195]]

be used to determine the existence of a condition that has a high 
probability of resulting in developmental delay under Sec.  
303.16(a)(2).
    (c) If the State elects to include in its system children who are at 
risk under Sec.  303.16(b), the State shall describe the criteria and

    Note: Under this section and Sec.  303.322(c)(2), States are 
required to ensure that informed clinical opinion is used in determining 
a child's eligibility under this part. Informed clinical opinion is 
especially important if there are no standardized measures, or if the 
standardized procedures are not appropriate for a given age or 
developmental area. If a given standardized procedure is considered to 
be appropriate, a State's criteria could include percentiles or 
percentages of levels of functioning on standardized measures.

nature and scope of the services and assistance available from each of 
the sources listed in the directory; and
    (2) Enable the parent of a child eligible under this part to 
contact, by telephone or letter, any of the sources listed in the 
directory.
    (c) The central directory must be--
    (1) Updated at least annually; and
    (2) Accessible to the general public.
    (d) To meet the requirements in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, 
the lead agency shall arrange for copies of the directory to be 
available--
    (1) In each geographic region of the State, including rural areas; 
and
    (2) In places and a manner that ensure accessibility by persons with 
disabilities.

assist in the development of the child.
    (2) The lead agency shall be responsible for ensuring that the 
requirements of this section are implemented by all affected public 
agencies and service providers in the State.
    (b) Definitions of evaluation and assessment. As used in this part--
    (1) Evaluation means the procedures used by appropriate qualified 
personnel to determine a child's initial and continuing eligibility 
under this part, consistent with the definition of ``infants and 
toddlers with disabilities'' in Sec.  303.16, including determining the 
status of the child in each of the developmental areas in paragraph 
(c)(3)(ii) of this section.
    (2) Assessment means the ongoing procedures used by appropriate 
qualified personnel throughout the period of a child's eligibility under 
this part to identify--
    (i) The child's unique strengths and needs and the services 
appropriate to meet those needs; and
    (ii) The resources, priorities, and concerns of the family and the 
supports and services necessary to enhance the family's capacity to meet

    (B) Physical development, including vision and hearing.
    (C) Communication development.
    (D) Social or emotional development.
    (E) Adaptive development.
    (iii) An assessment of the unique needs of the child in terms of 
each of the developmental areas in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, 
including the identification of services appropriate to meet those 
needs.
    (d) Family assessment. (1) Family assessments under this part must 
be family-directed and designed to determine the resources, priorities, 
and concerns of the family and the identification of the supports and 
services necessary to enhance the family's capacity to meet the 
developmental needs of the child.
    (2) Any assessment that is conducted must be voluntary on the part 
of the family.
    (3) If an assessment of the family is carried out, the assessment 
must--
    (i) Be conducted by personnel trained to utilize appropriate methods 
and procedures;
    (ii) Be based on information provided by the family through a 
personal interview; and
    (iii) Incorporate the family's description of its resources, 
priorities, and concerns related to enhancing the child's development.

    (b) As used in this part, individualized family service plan and 
IFSP mean a written plan for providing early intervention services to a 
child eligible under this part and the child's family. The plan must--
    (1) Be developed in accordance with Sec. Sec.  303.342 and 303.343;
    (2) Be based on the evaluation and assessment described in Sec.  
303.322; and
    (3) Include the matters specified in Sec.  303.344.
    (c) Lead agency responsibility. The lead agency shall ensure that an 
IFSP is developed and implemented for each eligible child, in accordance 
with the requirements of this part. If there is a dispute between 
agencies as to who has responsibility for developing or implementing an 
IFSP, the lead agency shall resolve the dispute or assign 
responsibility.

    Note: In instances where an eligible child must have both an IFSP 
and an individualized service plan under another Federal program, it may 
be possible to develop a single consolidated document, provided that it 
(1) contains all of the required information in Sec.  303.344, and (2) 
is developed in accordance with the requirements of this part.


<R05>
Sec.  303.341  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec.  303.342  Procedures for IFSP development, review, and evaluation.

    (a) Meeting to develop initial IFSP--timelines. For a child who has 
been evaluated for the first time and determined to be eligible, a 
meeting to develop the initial IFSP must be conducted within the 45-day 
time period in Sec.  303.321(e).
    (b) Periodic review. (1) A review of the IFSP for a child and the 
child's family must be conducted every six months, or more frequently if 
conditions warrant, or if the family requests such a review. The purpose 
of the periodic review is to determine--
    (i) The degree to which progress toward achieving the outcomes is 
being made; and
    (ii) Whether modification or revision of the outcomes or services is 
necessary.
    (2) The review may be carried out by a meeting or by another means 
that is acceptable to the parents and other participants.

[[Page 199]]

    (c) Annual meeting to evaluate the IFSP. A meeting must be conducted 
on at least an annual basis to evaluate the IFSP for a child and the 
child's family, and, as appropriate, to revise its provisions. The 
results of any current evaluations conducted under Sec.  303.322(c), and 
other information available from the ongoing assessment of the child and 
family, must be used in determining what services are needed and will be 
provided.
    (d) Accessibility and convenience of meetings. (1) IFSP meetings 
must be conducted--
    (i) In settings and at times that are convenient to families; and
    (ii) In the native language of the family or other mode of 
communication used by the family, unless it is clearly not feasible to 
do so.
    (2) Meeting arrangements must be made with, and written notice 
provided to, the family and other participants early enough before the 
meeting date to ensure that they will be able to attend.
    (e) Parental consent. The contents of the IFSP must be fully 
explained to the parents and informed written consent from the parents 
must be obtained prior to the provision of early intervention services 
described in the plan. If the parents do not provide consent with 
respect to a particular early intervention service or withdraw consent 
after first providing it, that service may not be provided. The early 
intervention services to which parental consent is obtained must be 
provided.

1820-0550)

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1436)
    Note: The requirement for the annual evaluation incorporates the 
periodic review process. Therefore, it is necessary to have only one 
separate periodic review each year (i.e., six months after the initial 
and subsequent annual IFSP meetings), unless conditions warrant 
otherwise.

    Because the needs of infants and toddlers change so rapidly during 
the course of a year, certain evaluation procedures may need to be 
repeated before conducting the periodic reviews and annual evaluation 
meetings in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.


<R05>
Sec.  303.343  Participants in IFSP meetings and periodic reviews.

    (a) Initial and annual IFSP meetings. (1) Each initial meeting and 
each annual meeting to evaluate the IFSP must include the following 
participants:
    (i) The parent or parents of the child.
    (ii) Other family members, as requested by the parent, if feasible 
to do so;
    (iii) An advocate or person outside of the family, if the parent 
requests that the person participate.
    (iv) The service coordinator who has been working with the family 
since the initial referral of the child for evaluation, or who has been 
designated by the public agency to be responsible for implementation of 
the IFSP.
    (v) A person or persons directly involved in conducting the 
evaluations and assessments in Sec.  303.322.
    (vi) As appropriate, persons who will be providing services to the 
child or family.
    (2) If a person listed in paragraph (a)(1)(v) of this section is 
unable to attend a meeting, arrangements must be made for the person's 
involvement through other means, including--
    (i) Participating in a telephone conference call;
    (ii) Having a knowledgeable authorized representative attend the 
meeting; or
    (iii) Making pertinent records available at the meeting.
    (b) Periodic review. Each periodic review must provide for the 
participation of persons in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (a)(1)(iv) of 
this section. If conditions warrant, provisions must be made for the 
participation of other representatives identified in paragraph (a) of 
this section.

the steps that will be taken to secure those services through public or 
private sources.
    (2) The requirement in paragraph (e)(1) of this section does not 
apply to routine medical services (e.g., immunizations and ``well-baby'' 
care), unless a child needs those services and the services are not 
otherwise available or being provided.
    (f) Dates; duration of services. The IFSP must include--
    (1) The projected dates for initiation of the services in paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section as soon as possible after the IFSP meetings 
described in Sec.  303.342; and
    (2) The anticipated duration of those services.
    (g) Service coordinator. (1) The IFSP must include the name of the

all applicable responsibilities under this part), who will be 
responsible for the implementation of the IFSP and coordination with 
other agencies and persons.
    (2) In meeting the requirements in paragraph (g)(1) of this section,

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1436(d))
    Note 1: With respect to the requirements in paragraph (d) of this 
section, the appropriate location of services for some infants and 
toddlers might be a hospital setting--during the period in which they 
require extensive medical intervention. However, for these and other 
eligible children, early intervention services must be provided in 
natural environments (e.g., the home, child care centers, or other 
community settings) to the maximum extent appropriate to the needs of 
the child.
    Note 2: Throughout the process of developing and implementing IFSPs 
for an eligible child and the child's family, it is important for 
agencies to recognize the variety of roles that family members play in 
enhancing the child's development. It also is important that the degree 
to which the needs of the family are addressed in the IFSP process is 
determined in a collaborative manner with the full agreement and 
participation of the parents of the child. Parents retain the ultimate 
decision in determining whether they, their child, or other family 
members will accept or decline services under this part.
    Note 3: The early intervention services in paragraph (d) of this 
section are those services that a State is required to provide to a 
child in accordance with Sec.  303.12.

    The ``other services'' in paragraph (e) of this section are services 
that a child or family needs, but that are neither required nor covered 
under this part. While listing the non-required services in the IFSP 
does not mean that those services must be provided, their identification 
can be helpful to both the child's family and the service coordinator, 
for the following reasons: First, the IFSP would provide a comprehensive 
picture of the child's total service needs (including the need for 
medical and health services, as well as early intervention services). 
Second, it is appropriate for the service coordinator to assist the 
family in securing the non-required services (e.g., by (1) determining 
if there is a public agency that could provide financial assistance, if 
needed, (2) assisting in the preparation of eligibility claims or 
insurance claims, if needed, and (3) assisting the family in seeking out 
and arranging for the child to receive the needed medical-health 
services).
    Thus, to the extent appropriate, it is important for a State's 
procedures under this part to provide for ensuring that other needs of 
the child, and of the family related to enhancing the development of the 
child, such as medical and health needs, are considered and addressed, 
including determining (1) who will provide each service, and when, 
where, and how it will be provided, and (2) how the service will be paid 
for (e.g., through private insurance, an existing Federal-State funding 
source, such as Medicaid or EPSDT, or some other funding arrangement).
    Note 4: Although the IFSP must include information about each of the 
items in paragraphs (b) through (h) of this section, this does not mean 
that the IFSP must be a detailed, lengthy document. It might be a brief 
outline, with appropriate attachments that address each of the points in 
the paragraphs under this section. It is important for the IFSP itself 
to be clear about (a) what services are to be provided, (b) the actions 
that are to be taken by the service coordinator in initiating those 
services, and (c) what actions will be taken by the parents.

Sec.  303.345  Provision of services before evaluation and assessment are completed.

    Early intervention services for an eligible child and the child's 
family may commence before the completion of the evaluation and 
assessment in Sec.  303.322, if the following conditions are met:
    (a) Parental consent is obtained.
    (b) An interim IFSP is developed that includes--
    (1) The name of the service coordinator who will be responsible, 
consistent with Sec.  303.344(g), for implementation of the interim IFSP 
and coordination with other agencies and persons; and
    (2) The early intervention services that have been determined to be 
needed immediately by the child and the child's family.

[[Page 202]]

    (c) The evaluation and assessment are completed within the time 
period required in Sec.  303.322(e).

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1436(c))
    Note: This section is intended to accomplish two specific purposes: 
(1) To facilitate the provision of services in the event that a child 
has obvious immediate needs that are identified, even at the time of 
referral (e.g., a physician recommends that a child with cerebral palsy 
begin receiving physical therapy as soon as possible), and (2) to ensure 
that the requirements for the timely evaluation and assessment are not 
circumvented.


<R05>
Sec.  303.346  Responsibility and accountability.

    Each agency or person who has a direct role in the provision of 
early intervention services is responsible for making a good faith 
effort to assist each eligible child in achieving the outcomes in the 
child's IFSP. However, part C of the Act does not require that any 
agency or person be held accountable if an eligible child does not 
achieve the growth projected in the child's IFSP.

<R05>
Sec.  303.360  Comprehensive system of personnel development.

    (a) Each system must include a comprehensive system of personnel 
development.
    (b) The personnel development system under this part must--
    (1) Be consistent with the comprehensive system of personnel 
development required under part B of the Act (34 CFR 300.380 through 
300.387);
    (2) Provide for preservice and inservice training to be conducted on 
an interdisciplinary basis, to the extent appropriate;
    (3) Provide for the training of a variety of personnel needed to 
meet the requirements of this part, including public and private 
providers, primary referral sources, paraprofessionals, and persons who 
will serve as service coordinators; and
    (4) Ensure that the training provided relates specifically to--
    (i) Understanding the basic components of early intervention 
services available in the State;
    (ii) Meeting the interrelated social or emotional, health, 
developmental, and educational needs of eligible children under this 
part; and
    (iii) Assisting families in enhancing the development of their 
children, and in participating fully in the development and 
implementation of IFSPs.
    (c) A personnel development system under this part may include--
    (1) Implementing innovative strategies and activities for the 
recruitment and retention of early intervention service providers;
    (2) Promoting the preparation of early intervention providers who 
are fully and appropriately qualified to provide early intervention 
services under this part;
    (3) Training personnel to work in rural and inner-city areas; and
    (4) Training personnel to coordinate transition services for infants 
and toddlers with disabilities from an early intervention program under 
this part to a preschool program under part B of the Act or to other 
preschool or other appropriate services.

<R05>
Sec.  303.361  Personnel standards.

    (a) As used in this part--
    (1) Appropriate professional requirements in the State means entry 
level requirements that--
    (i) Are based on the highest requirements in the State applicable to 
the profession or discipline in which a person is providing early 
intervention services; and
    (ii) Establish suitable qualifications for personnel providing early 
intervention services under this part to eligible children and their 
families who are served by State, local, and private agencies.
    (2) Highest requirements in the State applicable to a specific 
profession or discipline means the highest entry-level academic degree 
needed for any State

[[Page 203]]

approved or recognized certification, licensing, registration, or other 
comparable requirements that apply to that profession or discipline.
    (3) Profession or discipline means a specific occupational category 
that--
    (i) Provides early intervention services to children eligible under 
this part and their families;
    (ii) Has been established or designated by the State; and
    (iii) Has a required scope of responsibility and degree of 
supervision.
    (4) State approved or recognized certification, licensing, 
registration, or other comparable requirements means the requirements 
that a State legislature either has enacted or has authorized a State 
agency to promulgate through rules to establish the entry-level 
standards for employment in a specific profession or discipline in that 
State.
    (b)(1) Each statewide system must have policies and procedures 
relating to the establishment and maintenance of standards to ensure 
that personnel necessary to carry out the purposes of this part are 
appropriately and adequately prepared and trained.
    (2) The policies and procedures required in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section must provide for the establishment and maintenance of standards 
that are consistent with any State-approved or State-recognized 
certification, licensing, registration, or other comparable requirements 
that apply to the profession or discipline in which a person is 
providing early intervention services.
    (c) To the extent that a State's standards for a profession or 
discipline, including standards for temporary or emergency 
certification, are not based on the highest requirements in the State 
applicable to a specific profession or discipline, the State's 
application for assistance under this part must include the steps the 
State is taking, the procedures for notifying public agencies and 
personnel of those steps, and the timelines it has established for the 
retraining or hiring of personnel that meet appropriate professional 
requirements in the State.
    (d)(1) In meeting the requirements in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this 
section, a determination must be made about the status of personnel 
standards in the State. That determination must be based on current 
information that accurately describes, for each profession or discipline 
in which personnel are providing early intervention services, whether 
the applicable standards are consistent with the highest requirements in 
the State for that profession or discipline.
    (2) The information required in paragraph (d)(1) of this section 
must be on file in the lead agency, and available to the public.
    (e) In identifying the ``highest requirements in the State'' for 
purposes of this section, the requirements of all State statutes and the 
rules of all State agencies applicable to serving children eligible 
under this part and their families must be considered.
    (f) A State may allow paraprofessionals and assistants who are 
appropriately trained and supervised, in accordance with State law, 
regulations, or written policy, to assist in the provision of early 
intervention services to eligible children under this part.
    (g) In implementing this section, a State may adopt a policy that 
includes making ongoing good-faith efforts to recruit and hire 
appropriately and adequately trained personnel to provide early 
intervention services to eligible children, including, in a geographic 
area of the State where there is a shortage of personnel that meet these 
qualifications, the most qualified individuals available who are making 
satisfactory progress toward completing applicable course work necessary 
to meet the standards described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, 
consistent with State law, within 3 years.

(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 
1820-0550)

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1435(a)(9))
    Note: This section requires that a State use its own existing 
highest requirements to determine the standards appropriate to personnel 
who provide early intervention services under this part. The regulations 
do not require States to set any specified training standard, such as a 
master's degree, for employment of personnel who provide services under 
this part.
    The regulations permit each State to determine the specific 
occupational categories required to provide early intervention services 
to children eligible under this part and their families, and to revise 
or expand these

[[Page 204]]

categories as needed. The professions or disciplines need not be limited 
to traditional occupational categories.

individual complaints dealing with the child, and any other area under 
this part involving records about the child and the child's family.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1439(a)(4))


<R05>
Sec.  303.403  Prior notice; native language.

    (a) General. Written prior notice must be given to the parents of a 
child eligible under this part a reasonable time before a public agency

identification, evaluation, or placement of the child, or the provision 
of appropriate early intervention services to the child and the child's 
family.
    (b) Content of notice. The notice must be in sufficient detail to 
inform the parents about--
    (1) The action that is being proposed or refused;

<R05>
Sec.  303.404  Parent consent.

    (a) Written parental consent must be obtained before--
    (1) Conducting the initial evaluation and assessment of a child 
under Sec.  303.322; and
    (2) Initiating the provision of early intervention services (see 
Sec.  303.342(e)).
    (b) If consent is not given, the public agency shall make reasonable 
efforts to ensure that the parent--
    (1) Is fully aware of the nature of the evaluation and assessment or 
the services that would be available; and
    (2) Understands that the child will not be able to receive the 
evaluation and assessment or services unless consent is given.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1439)
    Note 1: In addition to the consent requirements in this section, 
other consent requirements are included in (1) Sec.  303.460(a),

Educational Rights and Privacy), both of which apply to this part.
    Note 2: Under Sec.  300.504(b) of the part B regulations, a public 
agency may initiate procedures to challenge a parent's refusal to 
consent to the initial evaluation of the parent's child and, if 
successful, obtain the evaluation. This provision applies to eligible 
children under this part, since the part B evaluation requirement 
applies to all children with disabilities in a State, including infants 
and toddlers.


<R05>
Sec.  303.405  Parent right to decline service.

    The parents of a child eligible under this part may determine 
whether they, their child, or other family members will accept or 
decline any early intervention service under this part in accordance 
with State law, and may decline such a service after first accepting it, 
without jeopardizing other early intervention services under this part.

<R05>
Sec.  303.406  Surrogate parents.

    (a) General. Each lead agency shall ensure that the rights of 
children eligible under this part are protected if--
    (1) No parent (as defined in Sec.  303.18) can be identified;
    (2) The public agency, after reasonable efforts, cannot discover the 
whereabouts of a parent; or
    (3) The child is a ward of the State under the laws of that State.
    (b) Duty of lead agency and other public agencies. The duty of the 
lead agency, or other public agency under paragraph (a) of this section, 
includes the assignment of an individual to act as a surrogate for the 
parent. This must include a method for--
    (1) Determining whether a child needs a surrogate parent; and
    (2) Assigning a surrogate parent to the child.
    (c) Criteria for selecting surrogates. (1) The lead agency or other 
public agency may select a surrogate parent in any way permitted under 
State law.

the child.
    (d) Non-employee requirement; compensation. (1) A person assigned as 
a surrogate parent may not be--

    (ii) A person or an employee of a person providing early 
intervention services to the child or to any family member of the child.

[[Page 206]]

she is paid by a public agency to serve as a surrogate parent.
    (e) Responsibilities. A surrogate parent may represent a child in 
all matters related to--
    (1) The evaluation and assessment of the child;
    (2) Development and implementation of the child's IFSPs, including 
annual evaluations and periodic reviews;
    (3) The ongoing provision of early intervention services to the 
child; and

      Mediation and Due Process Procedures for Parents and Children


<R05>
Sec.  303.419  Mediation.

    (a) General. Each State shall ensure that procedures are established 
and implemented to allow parties to disputes involving any matter 
described in Sec.  303.403(a) to resolve the disputes through a 
mediation process which, at a minimum, must be available whenever a 
hearing is requested under Sec.  303.420. The lead agency may either use 
the mediation system established under Part B of the Act or establish 
its own system.
    (b) Requirements. The procedures must meet the following 
requirements:
    (1) The procedures must ensure that the mediation process--
    (i) Is voluntary on the part of the parties;
    (ii) Is not used to deny or delay a parent's right to a due process 
hearing under Sec.  303.420, or to deny any other rights afforded under 
Part C of the Act; and
    (iii) Is conducted by a qualified and impartial mediator who is 
trained in effective mediation techniques.
    (2) The State shall maintain a list of individuals who are qualified 
mediators and knowledgeable in laws and regulations relating to the 
provision of special education and related services.
    (3) The State shall bear the cost of the mediation process, 
including the costs of meetings described in paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (4) Each session in the mediation process must be scheduled in a 
timely manner and must be held in a location that is convenient to the 
parties to the dispute.
    (5) An agreement reached by the parties to the dispute in the 
mediation process must be set forth in a written mediation agreement.
    (6) Discussions that occur during the mediation process must be 
confidential and may not be used as evidence in any subsequent due 
process hearings or civil proceedings, and the parties to the mediation 
process may be required to sign a confidentiality pledge prior to the 
commencement of the process.
    (c) Meeting to encourage mediation. A State may establish procedures 
to require parents who elect not to use the mediation process to meet, 
at a time and location convenient to the parents, with a disinterested 
party--
    (1) Who is under contract with a parent training and information 
center or community parent resource center in the State established 
under sections 682 or 683 of the Act, or an appropriate alternative 
dispute resolution entity; and
    (2) Who would explain the benefits of the mediation process and 
encourage the parents to use the process.

Sec.  303.420  Due process procedures.

    Each system must include written procedures including procedures for 
mediation as described in Sec.  303.419, for the timely administrative 
resolution of individual child complaints by parents concerning any of 
the matters in Sec.  303.403(a). A State may meet this requirement by--
    (a) Adopting the mediation and due process procedures in 34 CFR 
300.506 through 300.512 and developing procedures that meet the 
requirements of Sec.  303.425; or
    (b) Developing procedures that--
    (1) Meet the requirements in Sec.  303.419 and Sec. Sec.  303.421 
through 303.425; and

[[Page 207]]

    (2) Provide parents a means of filing a complaint.

(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 
1820-0550)

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1439(a)(1))
    Note 1: Sections 303.420 through 303.425 are concerned with the 
adoption of impartial procedures for resolving individual child 
complaints (i.e., complaints that generally affect only a single child 
or the child's family). These procedures require the appointment of a 
decision-maker who is impartial, as defined in Sec.  303.421(b), to 
resolve a dispute concerning any of the matters in Sec.  303.403(a). The 
decision of the impartial decision-maker is binding unless it is 
reversed on appeal.
    A different type of administrative procedure is included in 
Sec. Sec.  303.510 through 303.512 of subpart F of this part. Under 
those procedures, the lead agency is responsible for (1) investigating 
any complaint that it receives (including individual child complaints 
and those that are systemic in nature), and (2) resolving the complaint 
if the agency determines that a violation has occurred.
    Note 2: It is important that the administrative procedures developed 
by a State be designed to result in speedy resolution of complaints. An 
infant's or toddler's development is so rapid that undue delay could be 
potentially harmful.

Sec.  303.421  Appointment of an impartial person.

    (a) Qualifications and duties. An impartial person must be appointed 
to implement the complaint resolution process in this subpart. The 
person must--
    (1) Have knowledge about the provisions of this part and the needs 
of, and services available for, eligible children and their families; 
and
    (2) Perform the following duties:
    (i) Listen to the presentation of relevant viewpoints about the 
complaint, examine all information relevant to the issues, and seek to 
reach a timely resolution of the complaint.
    (ii) Provide a record of the proceedings, including a written 
decision.
    (b) Definition of impartial. (1) As used in this section, impartial 
means that the person appointed to implement the complaint resolution 
process--
    (i) Is not an employee of any agency or other entity involved in the 
provision of early intervention services or care of the child; and
    (ii) Does not have a personal or professional interest that would 
conflict with his or her objectivity in implementing the process.
    (2) A person who otherwise qualifies under paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section is not an employee of an agency solely because the person is 
paid by the agency to implement the complaint resolution process.

    (a) General. Each lead agency shall ensure that the parents of 
children eligible under this part are afforded the rights in paragraph 
(b) of this section in any administrative proceedings carried out under 
Sec.  303.420.
    (b) Rights. Any parent involved in an administrative proceeding has 
the right to--
    (1) Be accompanied and advised by counsel and by individuals with 
special knowledge or training with respect to early intervention 
services for children eligible under this part;
    (2) Present evidence and confront, cross-examine, and compel the 
attendance of witnesses;
    (3) Prohibit the introduction of any evidence at the proceeding that 
has not been disclosed to the parent at least five days before the 
proceeding;
    (4) Obtain a written or electronic verbatim transcription of the 
proceeding; and
    (5) Obtain written findings of fact and decisions.

    (a) Any proceeding for implementing the complaint resolution process 
in this subpart must be carried out at a time and place that is 
reasonably convenient to the parents.
    (b) Each lead agency shall ensure that, not later than 30 days after 
the receipt of a parent's complaint, the impartial proceeding required 
under this

[[Page 208]]

subpart is completed and a written decision mailed to each of the 
parties.

(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 
1820-0550)

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1439(a)(1))
    Note: Under part B of the Act, States are allowed 45 days to conduct 
an impartial due process hearing (i.e., within 45 days after the receipt 
of a request for a hearing, a decision is reached and a copy of the 
decision is mailed to each of the parties). (See 34 CFR 300.512.) Thus, 
if a State, in meeting the requirements of Sec.  303.420, elects to 
adopt the due process procedures under part B, that State would also 
have 45 days for hearings. However, any State in that situation is 
encouraged (but not required) to accelerate the timeline for the due 
process hearing for children who are eligible under this part--from 45 
days to the 30-day timeline in this section. Because the needs of 
children in the birth-through-two-age range change so rapidly, quick 
resolution of complaints is important.


<R05>
Sec.  303.424  Civil action.

    Any party aggrieved by the findings and decision regarding an

<R05>
Sec.  303.527  Payor of last resort.

    (a) Nonsubstitution of funds. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section, funds under this part may not be used to satisfy a 
financial commitment for services that would otherwise have been paid 
for from another public or private source, including any medical program 
administered by the Secretary of Defense, but for the enactment of part 
C of the Act. Therefore, funds under this part may be used only for 
early intervention services that an eligible child needs but is not 
currently entitled to under any other Federal, State, local, or private 
source.
    (b) Interim payments--reimbursement. (1) If necessary to prevent a 
delay in the timely provision of services to an eligible child or the 
child's family, funds under this part may be used to pay the provider of 
services, pending reimbursement from the agency or entity that has 
ultimate responsibility for the payment.
    (2) Payments under paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be made 
for--
    (i) Early intervention services, as described in Sec.  303.12;
    (ii) Eligible health services (see Sec.  303.13); and
    (iii) Other functions and services authorized under this part, 
including child find and evaluation and assessment.
    (3) The provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section do not apply 
to medical services or ``well-baby'' health care (see Sec.  
303.13(c)(1)).
    (c) Non-reduction of benefits. Nothing in this part may be construed 
to permit a State to reduce medical or other assistance available or to 
alter eligibility under title V of the Social Security Act (SSA) 
(relating to maternal and child health) or title XIX of the SSA 
(relating to Medicaid for children eligible under this part) within the 
State.

(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 
1820-0550)

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1440)
    Note: The Congress intended that the enactment of part C not be 
construed as a license to any agency (including the lead agency and 
other agencies in the State) to withdraw funding for services that 
currently are or would be made available to eligible children but for 
the existence of the program under this part. Thus, the Congress 
intended that other funding sources would continue, and that there would 
be greater coordination among agencies regarding the payment of costs.
    The Congress further clarified its intent concerning payments under 
Medicaid by including in section 411(k)(13) of the Medicare Catastrophic 
Coverage Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-360) an amendment to title XIX of the 
Social Security Act. That amendment states, in effect, that nothing in 
this title shall be construed as prohibiting or restricting, or 
authorizing the Secretary of Health and Human Services to prohibit or 
restrict, payment under subsection (a) of section 1903 of the Social 
Security Act for medical assistance for covered services furnished to an 
infant or toddler with a disability because those services are included 
in the child's IFSP adopted pursuant to part C of the Act.

    (a) Once a State becomes subject to a corrective action plan under 
Sec.  345.60, the Governor of the State, subject to approval by the 
Secretary, shall appoint, within 30 days after the submission of the 
plan to the Secretary, a monitoring panel consisting of the following 
representatives:
    (1) The head of the lead agency designated by the Governor;
    (2) Two representatives from different public or private nonprofit

protection and advocacy services has not met the protection and advocacy 
service needs of the individuals with disabilities and their family 
members, guardians, advocates, or authorized representatives, for 
securing funding for and access to assistive technology devices and 
assistive technology services, and that there is good cause to provide 
the protection and advocacy services for the State through a contract 
with a second entity.
    (b) On making the determination in paragraph (a) of this section, 
the Governor may not enter into a contract with a second entity to 
provide the protection and advocacy services unless good cause exists

cause, and an opportunity to respond to the assertion that good cause 
has been shown;

cause to enter into a contract with a second entity to provide the 
protection and advocacy services, the Governor shall hold an open 
competition within the State and issue a request for proposals by 
entities desiring to provide the services.
    (2) The Governor shall not issue a request for proposals by entities 
desiring to provide protection and advocacy services until the first 
entity has been given notice and an opportunity to respond. If the first 
entity appeals the determination to the Secretary, the Governor shall 
issue such request only if the Secretary decides not to overturn the 
determination of the Governor. The Governor shall issue such request 
within 30 days after the end of the period during which the first entity 
has the opportunity to respond, or after the decision of the Secretary, 
as appropriate.
    (3) The competition shall be open to entities with the same 
expertise and ability to provide legal services as a system in Sec.  
345.30(b)(12). The competition shall ensure public involvement,

scope and duration. If more comprehensive services are required, then a 
new rehabilitation effort should be considered. Post-employment services 
are to be provided under an amended individualized plan for employment; 
thus, a re-determination of eligibility is not required. The provision 
of post-employment services is subject to the same requirements in this 
part as the provision of any other vocational rehabilitation service. 
Post-employment services are available to assist an individual to 
maintain employment, e.g., the individual's employment is jeopardized 
because of conflicts with supervisors or co-workers, and the individual 
needs mental health services and counseling to maintain the employment; 
to regain employment, e.g., the individual's job is eliminated through 
reorganization and new placement services are needed; and to advance in 
employment, e.g., the employment is no longer consistent with the 
individual's strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, 
capabilities, interests, and informed choice.
    (43) Qualified and impartial mediator.
    (i) Qualified and impartial mediator means an individual who--

    (C) Has not been involved previously in the vocational

with any State-approved or -recognized certification, licensing, 
registration, or other requirements; and
    (F) Has no personal, professional, or financial interest that would 
be in conflict with the objectivity of the individual during the 
mediation proceedings.
    (ii) An individual serving as a mediator is not considered to be an 
employee of the designated State agency or designated State unit for the 
purposes of this definition solely because the individual is paid by the 
designated State agency or designated State unit to serve as a mediator.

Sec.  361.36  Ability to serve all eligible individuals; order of selection for services.

    (a) General provisions.
    (1) The designated State unit either must be able to provide the 
full range of services listed in section 103(a) of the Act and Sec.  
361.48, as appropriate, to all eligible individuals or, in the event 
that vocational rehabilitation services cannot be provided to all 
eligible individuals in the State who apply for the services, include in 
the State plan the order to be followed in selecting eligible 
individuals to be provided vocational rehabilitation services.
    (2) The ability of the designated State unit to provide the full 
range of vocational rehabilitation services to all eligible individuals 
must be supported by a determination that satisfies the requirements of 
paragraph (b) or (c) of this section and a determination that, on the 
basis of the designated State unit's projected fiscal and personnel 
resources and its assessment of the rehabilitation needs of individuals 
with significant disabilities within the State, it can--
    (i) Continue to provide services to all individuals currently 
receiving services;
    (ii) Provide assessment services to all individuals expected to 
apply for services in the next fiscal year;
    (iii) Provide services to all individuals who are expected to be 
determined eligible in the next fiscal year; and
    (iv) Meet all program requirements.
    (3) If the designated State unit is unable to provide the full range 
vocational rehabilitation services to all eligible individuals in the 
State who apply for the services, the State plan must--
    (i) Show the order to be followed in selecting eligible individuals 
to be provided vocational rehabilitation services;
    (ii) Provide a justification for the order of selection;
    (iii) Identify service and outcome goals and the time within which 
the goals may be achieved for individuals in each priority category 
within the order, as required under Sec.  361.29(c)(5); and
    (iv) Assure that--
    (A) In accordance with criteria established by the State for the 
order of selection, individuals with the most significant disabilities 
will be selected first for the provision of vocational rehabilitation 
services; and
    (B) Individuals who do not meet the order of selection criteria will 
have access to services provided through the information and referral 
system established under Sec.  361.37.
    (b) Basis for assurance that services can be provided to all 
eligible individuals.
    (1) For a designated State unit that determined, for the current 
fiscal year and the preceding fiscal year, that it is able to provide 
the full range of services, as appropriate, to all eligible individuals, 
the State unit, during the current fiscal and preceding fiscal year, 
must have in fact--
    (i) Provided assessment services to all applicants and the full 
range of services, as appropriate, to all eligible individuals;
    (ii) Made referral forms widely available throughout the State;
    (iii) Conducted outreach efforts to identify and serve individuals 
with disabilities who have been unserved or underserved by the 
vocational rehabilitation system; and
    (iv) Not delayed, through waiting lists or other means, 
determinations of eligibility, the development of individualized plans 
for employment for individuals determined eligible for vocational 
rehabilitation services, or the provision of services for eligible 
individuals for whom individualized plans for employment have been 
developed.
    (2) For a designated State unit that was unable to provide the full 
range of services to all eligible individuals during the current or 
preceding fiscal year or that has not met the requirements in paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section, the determination that the designated State unit 
is able to provide the full range of vocational rehabilitation services 
to all eligible individuals in the next fiscal year must be based on--
    (i) Circumstances that have changed that will allow the designated 
State unit to meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section 
in the next fiscal year, including--
    (A) An estimate of the number of and projected costs of serving, in 
the next

[[Page 294]]

fiscal year, individuals with existing individualized plans for 
employment;
    (B) The projected number of individuals with disabilities who will 
apply for services and will be determined eligible in the next fiscal 
year and the projected costs of serving those individuals;
    (C) The projected costs of administering the program in the next 
fiscal year, including, but not limited to, costs of staff salaries and 
benefits, outreach activities, and required statewide studies; and
    (D) The projected revenues and projected number of qualified 
personnel for the program in the next fiscal year;
    (ii) Comparable data, as relevant, for the current or preceding 
fiscal year, or for both years, of the costs listed in paragraphs 
(b)(2)(i)(A) through (C) of this section and the resources identified in 
paragraph (b)(2)(i)(D) of this section and an explanation of any 
projected increases or decreases in these costs and resources; and
    (iii) A determination that the projected revenues and the projected 
number of qualified personnel for the program in the next fiscal year 
are adequate to cover the costs identified in paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(A) 
through (C) of this section to ensure the provision of the full range of 
services, as appropriate, to all eligible individuals.
    (c) Determining need for establishing and implementing an order of 
selection.
    (1) The designated State unit must determine, prior to the beginning 
of each fiscal year, whether to establish and implement an order of 
selection.
    (2) If the designated State unit determines that it does not need to 
establish an order of selection, it must reevaluate this determination 
whenever changed circumstances during the course of a fiscal year, such 
as a decrease in its fiscal or personnel resources or an increase in its 
program costs, indicate that it may no longer be able to provide the 
full range of services, as appropriate, to all eligible individuals, as 
described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (3) If a DSU establishes an order of selection, but determines that 
it does not need to implement that order at the beginning of the fiscal 
year, it must continue to meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section, or it must implement the order of selection by closing one 
or more priority categories.
    (d) Establishing an order of selection.
    (1) Basis for order of selection. An order of selection must be 
based on a refinement of the three criteria in the definition of 
``individual with a significant disability'' in section 7(21)(A) of the 
Act and Sec.  361.5(b)(31).
    (2) Factors that cannot be used in determining order of selection of

identified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the designated State 
unit must--
    (1) Refer the individual to Federal or State programs, including

    (i) A notice of the referral by the designated State agency to the 
agency carrying out the program;
    (ii) Information identifying a specific point of contact within the 
agency to which the individual is being referred; and

[[Page 296]]

employment.
    (d) Order of selection. In providing the information and referral 
services under this section to eligible individuals who are not in the 
priority category or categories to receive vocational rehabilitation 
services under the State's order of selection, the State unit must 
identify, as part of its reporting under section 101(a)(10) of the Act 
and Sec.  361.40, the number of eligible individuals who did not meet 
the agency's order of selection criteria for receiving vocational 
rehabilitation services and did receive information and referral

Sec.  361.42  Assessment for determining eligibility and priority for services.

    In order to determine whether an individual is eligible for 
vocational rehabilitation services and the individual's priority under 
an order of selection for services (if the State is operating under an 
order of selection), the designated State unit must conduct an 
assessment for determining eligibility and priority for services. The 
assessment must be conducted in the most integrated setting possible, 
consistent with the individual's needs and informed choice, and in 
accordance with the following provisions:
    (a) Eligibility requirements.
    (1) Basic requirements. The designated State unit's determination of 
an applicant's eligibility for vocational rehabilitation services must 
be based only on the following requirements:
    (i) A determination by qualified personnel that the applicant has a 
physical or mental impairment.
    (ii) A determination by qualified personnel that the applicant's 
physical or mental impairment constitutes or results in a substantial 
impediment to employment for the applicant.
    (iii) A determination by a qualified vocational rehabilitation 
counselor employed by the designated State unit that the applicant 
requires vocational rehabilitation services to prepare for, secure, 
retain, or regain employment consistent with the applicant's unique 
strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, capabilities, 
interests, and informed choice.
    (iv) A presumption, in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section, that the applicant can benefit in terms of an employment 
outcome from the provision of vocational rehabilitation services.
    (2) Presumption of benefit. The designated State unit must presume 
that an applicant who meets the eligibility requirements in paragraphs 
(a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section can benefit in terms of an employment 
outcome unless it demonstrates, based on clear and convincing evidence, 
that the applicant is incapable of benefiting in terms of an employment 
outcome from vocational rehabilitation services due to the severity of 
the applicant's disability.
    (3) Presumption of eligibility for Social Security recipients and 
beneficiaries.
    (i) Any applicant who has been determined eligible for Social 
Security benefits under Title II or Title XVI of the Social Security Act 
is--
    (A) Presumed eligible for vocational rehabilitation services under 
paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section; and
    (B) Considered an individual with a significant disability as 
defined in Sec.  361.5(b)(31).
    (ii) If an applicant for vocational rehabilitation services asserts 
that he or she is eligible for Social Security benefits under Title II 
or Title XVI of the Social Security Act (and, therefore, is presumed 
eligible for vocational rehabilitation services under paragraph 
(a)(3)(i)(A) of this section), but is unable to provide appropriate 
evidence, such as an award letter, to support that assertion, the State 
unit must verify the applicant's eligibility under Title II or Title XVI 
of the Social Security Act by contacting the Social Security 
Administration. This verification must be made within a reasonable 
period of time that enables the State unit to determine the applicant's 
eligibility for vocational rehabilitation services within 60 days of the 
individual submitting an application for services in accordance with 
Sec.  361.41(b)(2).
    (4) Achievement of an employment outcome. Any eligible 
rehabilitation services is based on the individual being eligible for 
Social Security benefits under Title II or Title XVI of the Social 
Security Act, must intend to achieve an employment outcome that is 
consistent with the applicant's unique strengths, resources, priorities, 
concerns, abilities, capabilities, interests, and informed choice.

[[Page 300]]

    (i) The State unit is responsible for informing individuals, through 
its application process for vocational rehabilitation services, that 
individuals who receive services under the program must intend to 
achieve an employment outcome.
    (ii) The applicant's completion of the application process for 
vocational rehabilitation services is sufficient evidence of the 
individual's intent to achieve an employment outcome, and no additional 
demonstration on the part of the applicant is required for purposes of 
satisfying paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
    (5) Interpretation. Nothing in this section, including paragraph 
(a)(3)(i), is to be construed to create an entitlement to any vocational 
rehabilitation service.
    (b) Interim determination of eligibility.
    (1) The designated State unit may initiate the provision of 
vocational rehabilitation services for an applicant on the basis of an 
interim determination of eligibility prior to the 60-day period 
described in Sec.  361.41(b)(2).
    (2) If a State chooses to make interim determinations of 
eligibility, the designated State unit must--
    (i) Establish criteria and conditions for making those 
determinations;
    (ii) Develop and implement procedures for making the determinations; 
and
    (iii) Determine the scope of services that may be provided pending 
the final determination of eligibility.
    (3) If a State elects to use an interim eligibility determination, 
the designated State unit must make a final determination of eligibility 
within 60 days of the individual submitting an application for services 
in accordance with Sec.  361.41(b)(2).
    (c) Prohibited factors.
    (1) The State plan must assure that the State unit will not impose, 
as part of determining eligibility under this section, a duration of 
residence requirement that excludes from services any applicant who is 
present in the State.
    (2) In making a determination of eligibility under this section, the 
designated State unit also must ensure that--
    (i) No applicant or group of applicants is excluded or found 
ineligible solely on the basis of the type of disability; and
    (ii) The eligibility requirements are applied without regard to 
the--
    (A) Age, gender, race, color, or national origin of the applicant;
    (B) Type of expected employment outcome;
    (C) Source of referral for vocational rehabilitation services; and
    (D) Particular service needs or anticipated cost of services 
required by an applicant or the income level of an applicant or 
applicant's family.
    (d) Review and assessment of data for eligibility determination. 
Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, the designated 
State unit--
    (1) Must base its determination of each of the basic eligibility 
requirements in paragraph (a) of this section on--
    (i) A review and assessment of existing data, including counselor 
observations, education records, information provided by the individual 
or the individual's family, particularly information used by education 
officials, and determinations made by officials of other agencies; and
    (ii) To the extent existing data do not describe the current 
functioning of the individual or are unavailable, insufficient, or 
inappropriate to make an eligibility determination, an assessment of 
additional data resulting from the provision of vocational 
rehabilitation services, including trial work experiences, assistive 
technology devices and services, personal assistance services, and any 
other support services that are necessary to determine whether an 
individual is eligible; and
    (2) Must base its presumption under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this 
section that an applicant who has been determined eligible for Social 
Security benefits under Title II or Title XVI of the Social Security Act 
satisfies each of the basic eligibility requirements in paragraph (a) of 
this section on determinations made by the Social Security 
Administration.
    (e) Trial work experiences for individuals with significant 
disabilities.

[[Page 301]]

    (1) Prior to any determination that an individual with a disability 
is incapable of benefiting from vocational rehabilitation services in 
terms of an employment outcome because of the severity of that 
individual's disability, the designated State unit must conduct an 
exploration of the individual's abilities, capabilities, and capacity to 
perform in realistic work situations to determine whether or not there 
is clear and convincing evidence to support such a determination.
    (2)(i) The designated State unit must develop a written plan to 
assess periodically the individual's abilities, capabilities, and 
capacity to perform in work situations through the use of trial work 
experiences, which must be provided in the most integrated setting 
possible, consistent with the informed choice and rehabilitation needs 
of the individual.
    (ii) Trial work experiences include supported employment, on-the-job 
training, and other experiences using realistic work settings.
    (iii) Trial work experiences must be of sufficient variety and over 
a sufficient period of time for the designated State unit to determine 
that--
    (A) There is sufficient evidence to conclude that the individual can 
benefit from the provision of vocational rehabilitation services in 
terms of an employment outcome; or
    (B) There is clear and convincing evidence that the individual is 
incapable of benefiting from vocational rehabilitation services in terms 
of an employment outcome due to the severity of the individual's 
disability.
    (iv) The designated State unit must provide appropriate supports, 
including assistive technology devices and services and personal 
assistance services, to accommodate the rehabilitation needs of the 
individual during the trial work experiences.
    (f) Extended evaluation for certain individuals with significant 
disabilities.
    (1) Under limited circumstances if an individual cannot take 
advantage of trial work experiences or if options for trial work 
experiences have been exhausted before the State unit is able to make 
the determinations described in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section, 
the designated State unit must conduct an extended evaluation to make 
these determinations.
    (2) During the extended evaluation period, vocational rehabilitation 
services must be provided in the most integrated setting possible, 
consistent with the informed choice and rehabilitation needs of the 
individual.
    (3) During the extended evaluation period, the designated State unit 
must develop a written plan for providing services necessary to make a 
determination under paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section.
    (4) During the extended evaluation period, the designated State unit 
provides only those services that are necessary to make the 
determinations described in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section and 
terminates extended evaluation services when the State unit is able to 
make the determinations.
    (g) Data for determination of priority for services under an order 
of selection. If the designated State unit is operating under an order 
of selection for services, as provided in Sec.  361.36, the State unit 
must base its priority assignments on--
    (1) A review of the data that was developed under paragraphs (d) and 
(e) of this section to make the eligibility determination; and
    (2) An assessment of additional data, to the extent necessary.

    Note to Sec.  361.42: Clear and convincing evidence means that the 
designated State unit shall have a high degree of certainty before it 
can conclude that an individual is incapable of benefiting from services 
in terms of an employment outcome. The ``clear and convincing'' standard 
constitutes the highest standard used in our civil system of law and is 
to be individually applied on a case-by-case basis. The term clear means 
unequivocal. For example, the use of an intelligence test result alone 
would not constitute clear and convincing evidence. Clear and convincing 
evidence might include a description

Sec.  361.50  Written policies governing the provision of services for individuals with disabilities.

    (a) Policies. The State unit must develop and maintain written 
policies covering the nature and scope of each of the vocational 
rehabilitation services specified in Sec.  361.48 and the criteria under 
which each service is provided. The policies must ensure that the 
provision of services is based on the rehabilitation needs of each 
individual as identified in that individual's IPE and is consistent with 
the individual's informed choice. The written policies may not establish 
any arbitrary limits on the nature and scope of vocational 
rehabilitation services to be provided to the individual to achieve an 
employment outcome. The policies must be developed in accordance with 
the following provisions:
    (b) Out-of-State services.
    (1) The State unit may establish a preference for in-State services, 
provided that the preference does not effectively deny an individual a 
necessary service. If the individual chooses an out-of-State service at 
a higher cost

[[Page 310]]

than an in-State service, if either service would meet the individual's 
rehabilitation needs, the designated State unit is not responsible for 
those costs in excess of the cost of the in-State service.
    (2) The State unit may not establish policies that effectively 
prohibit the provision of out-of-State services.
    (c) Payment for services.
    (1) The State unit must establish and maintain written policies to 
govern the rates of payment for all purchased vocational rehabilitation 
services.
    (2) The State unit may establish a fee schedule designed to ensure a 
reasonable cost to the program for each service, if the schedule is--
    (i) Not so low as to effectively deny an individual a necessary 
service; and
    (ii) Not absolute and permits exceptions so that individual needs 
can be addressed.
    (3) The State unit may not place absolute dollar limits on specific 
service categories or on the total services provided to an individual.
    (d) Duration of services.
    (1) The State unit may establish reasonable time periods for the 
provision of services provided that the time periods are--
    (i) Not so short as to effectively deny an individual a necessary 
service; and
    (ii) Not absolute and permit exceptions so that individual needs can 
be addressed.
    (2) The State unit may not establish absolute time limits on the 
provision of specific services or on the provision of services to an 
individual. The duration of each service needed by an individual must be 
determined on an individual basis and reflected in that individual's 
individualized plan for employment.
    (e) Authorization of services. The State unit must establish 
policies related to the timely authorization of services, including any 
conditions under which verbal authorization can be given.

    (b) Affirmative action. The State plan must assure that community 
rehabilitation programs that receive assistance under part B of Title I 
of the Act take affirmative action to employ and advance in employment 
qualified individuals with disabilities covered under and on the same 
terms and conditions as in section 503 of the Act.
    (c) Special communication needs personnel. The designated State unit 
must ensure that providers of vocational rehabilitation services are 
able to communicate--
    (1) In the native language of applicants and eligible individuals 
who have limited English speaking ability; and
    (2) By using appropriate modes of communication used by applicants 
and eligible individuals.

mediation or a formal hearing. A State's informal process must not be 
used to deny the right of an applicant or eligible individual to a 
hearing under paragraph (e) of this section or any other right provided 
under this part, including the right to pursue mediation under paragraph 
(d) of this section. If informal resolution under this paragraph or 
mediation under paragraph (d) of this section is not successful in 
resolving the dispute within the time period established under paragraph 
(e)(1) of this section, a formal hearing must be conducted within that 
same time period, unless the parties agree to a specific extension of 
time.
    (d) Mediation.
    (1) The State must establish and implement procedures, as required 
under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, to allow an applicant or 
eligible individual and the State unit to resolve disputes involving 
State unit determinations that affect the provision of vocational 
rehabilitation services through a mediation process that must be made 
available, at a minimum, whenever an applicant or eligible individual 
or, as appropriate, the individual's representative requests an 
impartial due process hearing under this section.

[[Page 317]]

    (2) Mediation procedures established by the State unit under 
paragraph (d) must ensure that--
    (i) Participation in the mediation process is voluntary on the part 
of the applicant or eligible individual, as appropriate, and on the part 
of the State unit;
    (ii) Use of the mediation process is not used to deny or delay the 
applicant's or eligible individual's right to pursue resolution of the 
dispute through an impartial hearing held within the time period 
specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section or any other rights 
provided under this part. At any point during the mediation process, 
either party or the mediator may elect to terminate the mediation. In 
the event mediation is terminated, either party may pursue resolution 
through an impartial hearing;
    (iii) The mediation process is conducted by a qualified and 
impartial mediator, as defined in Sec.  361.5(b)(43), who must be 
selected from a list of qualified and impartial mediators maintained by 
the State--
    (A) On a random basis;
    (B) By agreement between the director of the designated State unit 
and the applicant or eligible individual or, as appropriate, the 
individual's representative; or
    (C) In accordance with a procedure established in the State for 
assigning mediators, provided this procedure ensures the neutrality of 
the mediator assigned; and
    (iv) Mediation sessions are scheduled and conducted in a timely 
manner and are held in a location and manner that is convenient to the 
parties to the dispute.
    (3) Discussions that occur during the mediation process must be kept 
confidential and may not be used as evidence in any subsequent due 
process hearings or civil proceedings, and the parties to the mediation 
process may be required to sign a confidentiality pledge prior to the 
commencement of the process.
    (4) An agreement reached by the parties to the dispute in the 
mediation process must be described in a written mediation agreement 
that is developed by the parties with the assistance of the qualified 
and impartial mediator and signed by both parties. Copies of the 
agreement must be sent to both parties.
    (5) The costs of the mediation process must be paid by the State. 
The State is not required to pay for any costs related to the 
representation of an applicant or eligible individual authorized under 
paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section.
    (e) Impartial due process hearings. The State unit must establish 
and implement formal review procedures, as required under paragraph 
(b)(1)(i) of this section, that provide that--
    (1) A hearing conducted by an impartial hearing officer, selected in 
accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, must be held within 60 
days of an applicant's or eligible individual's request for review of a 
determination made by personnel of the State unit that affects the 
provision of vocational rehabilitation services to the individual, 
unless informal resolution or a mediation agreement is achieved prior to 
the 60th day or the parties agree to a specific extension of time;
    (2) In addition to the rights described in paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section, the applicant or eligible individual or, if appropriate, the 
individual's representative must be given the opportunity to present 
witnesses during the hearing and to examine all witnesses and other 
relevant sources of information and evidence;
    (3) The impartial hearing officer must--
    (i) Make a decision based on the provisions of the approved State 
plan, the Act, Federal vocational rehabilitation regulations, and State 
regulations and policies that are consistent with Federal requirements; 
and
    (ii) Provide to the individual or, if appropriate, the individual's 
representative and to the State unit a full written report of the 
findings and grounds for the decision within 30 days of the completion 
of the hearing; and
    (4) The hearing officer's decision is final, except that a party may 
request an impartial review under paragraph (g)(1) of this section if 
the State has established procedures for that review, and a party 
involved in a hearing may bring a civil action under paragraph (i) of 
this section.

[[Page 318]]

    (f) Selection of impartial hearing officers. The impartial hearing 
officer for a particular case must be selected--
    (1) From a list of qualified impartial hearing officers maintained 
by the State unit. Impartial hearing officers included on the list must 
be--
    (i) Identified by the State unit if the State unit is an independent 
commission; or
    (ii) Jointly identified by the State unit and the State 
Rehabilitation Council if the State has a Council; and
    (2)(i) On a random basis; or
    (ii) By agreement between the director of the designated State unit 
and the applicant or eligible individual or, as appropriate, the 
individual's representative.
    (g) Administrative review of hearing officer's decision. The State 
may establish procedures to enable a party who is dissatisfied with the 
decision of the impartial hearing officer to seek an impartial 
administrative review of the decision under paragraph (e)(3) of this 
section in accordance with the following requirements:
    (1) A request for administrative review under paragraph (g) of this 
section must be made within 20 days of the mailing of the impartial 
hearing officer's decision.
    (2) Administrative review of the hearing officer's decision must be 
conducted by--
    (i) The chief official of the designated State agency if the State 
has established both a designated State agency and a designated State 
unit under Sec.  361.13(b); or
    (ii) An official from the office of the Governor.
    (3) The reviewing official described in paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this 
section--
    (i) Provides both parties with an opportunity to submit additional 
evidence and information relevant to a final decision concerning the 
matter under review;
    (ii) May not overturn or modify the hearing officer's decision, or 
any part of that decision, that supports the position of the applicant 
or eligible individual unless the reviewing official concludes, based on 
clear and convincing evidence, that the decision of the impartial 
hearing officer is clearly erroneous on the basis of being contrary to 
the approved State plan, the Act, Federal vocational rehabilitation 
regulations, or State regulations and policies that are consistent with 
Federal requirements;
    (iii) Makes an independent, final decision following a review of the 
entire hearing record and provides the decision in writing, including a 
full report of the findings and the statutory, regulatory, or policy 
grounds for the decision, to the applicant or eligible individual or, as 
appropriate, the individual's representative and to the State unit 
within 30 days of the request for administrative review under paragraph 
(g)(1) of this section; and
    (iv) May not delegate the responsibility for making the final 
decision under paragraph (g) of this section to any officer or employee 
of the designated State unit.
    (4) The reviewing official's decision under paragraph (g) of this 
section is final unless either party brings a civil action under 
paragraph (i) of this section.
    (h) Implementation of final decisions. If a party brings a civil 
action under paragraph (h) of this section to challenge the final 
decision of a hearing officer under paragraph (e) of this section or to

paragraph (g) of this section, the final decision of the hearing officer 
or State reviewing official must be implemented pending review by the 
court.
    (i) Civil action.
    (1) Any party who disagrees with the findings and decision of an 
impartial hearing officer under paragraph (e) of this section in a State 
that has not established administrative review procedures under 
paragraph (g) of this section and any party who disagrees with the 
findings and decision under paragraph (g)(3)(iii) of this section have a 
right to bring a civil action with respect to the matter in dispute. The 
action may be brought in any State court of competent jurisdiction or in

regard to the amount in controversy.
    (2) In any action brought under paragraph (i) of this section, the

    Subpart C--Financing of State Vocational Rehabilitation Programs


<R05>
Sec.  361.60  Matching requirements.

    (a) Federal share.
    (1) General. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, 
the Federal share for expenditures made by the State under the State 
plan, including expenditures for the provision of vocational 
rehabilitation services and the administration of the State plan, is 
78.7 percent.
    (2) Construction projects. The Federal share for expenditures made 
for the construction of a facility for community rehabilitation program 
purposes may not be more than 50 percent of the total cost of the 
project.
    (b) Non-Federal share.
    (1) General. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) and (3) of this

[[Page 320]]

under this section must be consistent with the provisions of 34 CFR 
80.24.
    (2) Third party in-kind contributions. Third party in-kind 
contributions specified in 34 CFR 80.24(a)(2) may not be used to meet 
the non-Federal share under this section.
    (3) Contributions by private entities. Expenditures made from 
contributions by private organizations, agencies, or individuals that 
are deposited in the account of the State agency or sole local agency in 
accordance with State law and that are earmarked, under a condition 
imposed by the contributor, may be used as part of the non-Federal share 
under this section if the funds are earmarked for--
    (i) Meeting in whole or in part the State's share for establishing a 
community rehabilitation program or constructing a particular facility 
for community rehabilitation program purposes;
    (ii) Particular geographic areas within the State for any purpose 
under the State plan, other than those described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) 
of this section, in accordance with the following criteria:
    (A) Before funds that are earmarked for a particular geographic area 
may be used as part of the non-Federal share, the State must notify the 
Secretary that the State cannot provide the full non-Federal share 
without using these funds.
    (B) Funds that are earmarked for a particular geographic area may be 
used as part of the non-Federal share without requesting a waiver of 
statewideness under Sec.  361.26.
    (C) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, all 
Federal funds must be used on a statewide basis consistent with Sec.  
361.25, unless a waiver of statewideness is obtained under Sec.  361.26; 
and
    (iii) Any other purpose under the State plan, provided the 
expenditures do not benefit in any way the donor, an individual to whom 
the donor is related by blood or marriage or with whom the donor has a 
close personal relationship, or an individual, entity, or organization 
with whom the donor shares a financial interest. The Secretary does not 
consider a donor's receipt from the State unit of a grant, subgrant, or 
contract with funds allotted under this part to be a benefit for the 
purposes of this paragraph if the grant, subgrant, or contract is 
awarded under the State's regular competitive procedures.

services to special groups that State or Federal law permits to be 
targeted for services (e.g., students with disabilities who are 
receiving special education services), consistent with the State's order 
of selection, if applicable; or carrying out particular types of 
administrative activities permissible under State law. Contributions 
also may be restricted to particular geographic areas to increase 
services or expand the scope of services that are available statewide

Sec.  361.61  Limitation on use of funds for construction expenditures.

    No more than 10 percent of a State's allotment for any fiscal year 
under section 110 of the Act may be spent on the construction of 
facilities for community rehabilitation program purposes.

(Authority: Section 101(a)(17)(A) of the Act; 29 U.S.C. 
721(a)(17)(A))<ls-thn-eq>


<R05>
Sec.  361.62  Maintenance of effort requirements.

    (a) General requirements.
    (1) The Secretary reduces the amount otherwise payable to a State 
for a fiscal year by the amount by which the total expenditures from 
non-Federal sources under the State plan for the previous fiscal year 
were less than the total of those expenditures for the fiscal year 2 
years prior to the previous fiscal year.

    Example: For fiscal year 2001, a State's maintenance of effort level 
is based on the amount of its expenditures from non-Federal sources for 
fiscal year 1999. Thus, if the

[[Page 321]]

State's non-Federal expenditures in 2001 are less than they were in 
1999, the State has a maintenance of effort deficit, and the Secretary 
reduces the State's allotment in 2002 by the amount of that deficit.

    (2) If, at the time the Secretary makes a determination that a State 
has failed to meet its maintenance of effort requirements, it is too 
late for the Secretary to make a reduction in accordance with paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section, then the Secretary recovers the amount of the 
maintenance of effort deficit through audit disallowance.
    (b) Specific requirements for construction of facilities. If the 
State provides for the construction of a facility for community 
rehabilitation program purposes, the amount of the State's share of 
expenditures for vocational rehabilitation services under the plan, 
other than for the construction of a facility for community 
rehabilitation program purposes or the establishment of a facility for 
community rehabilitation purposes, must be at least equal to the 
expenditures for those services for the second prior fiscal year. If a 
State fails to meet the requirements of this paragraph, the Secretary 
recovers the amount of the maintenance of effort deficit through audit 
disallowance.
    (c) Separate State agency for vocational rehabilitation services for 
individuals who are blind. If there is a separate part of the State plan 
administered by a separate State agency to provide vocational 
rehabilitation services for individuals who are blind--
    (1) Satisfaction of the maintenance of effort requirements under 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section are determined based on the total 
amount of a State's non-Federal expenditures under both parts of the 
State plan; and
    (2) If a State fails to meet any maintenance of effort requirement, 
the Secretary reduces the amount otherwise payable to the State for that 
fiscal year under each part of the plan in direct relation to the amount 
by which expenditures from non-Federal sources under each part of the 
plan in the previous fiscal year were less than they were for that part 
of the plan for the fiscal year 2 years prior to the previous fiscal 
year.
    (d) Waiver or modification.
    (1) The Secretary may waive or modify the maintenance of effort 
requirement in paragraph (a)(1) of this section if the Secretary 
determines that a waiver or modification is necessary to permit the 
State to respond to exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances, such as 
a major natural disaster or a serious economic downturn, that--
    (i) Cause significant unanticipated expenditures or reductions in 
revenue that result in a general reduction of programs within the State; 
or
    (ii) Require the State to make substantial expenditures in the 
vocational rehabilitation program for long-term purposes due to the one-
time costs associated with the construction of a facility for community 
rehabilitation program purposes, the establishment of a facility for 
community rehabilitation program purposes, or the acquisition of 
equipment.
    (2) The Secretary may waive or modify the maintenance of effort 
requirement in paragraph (b) of this section or the 10 percent allotment 
limitation in Sec.  361.61 if the Secretary determines that a waiver or 
modification is necessary to permit the State to respond to exceptional 
or uncontrollable circumstances, such as a major natural disaster, that 
result in significant destruction of existing facilities and require the 
State to make substantial expenditures for the construction of a 
facility for community rehabilitation program purposes or the 
establishment of a facility for community rehabilitation program 
purposes in order to provide vocational rehabilitation services.
    (3) A written request for waiver or modification, including 
supporting justification, must be submitted to the Secretary as soon as 
the State determines that an exceptional or uncontrollable circumstance 
will prevent it from making its required expenditures from non-Federal 
sources.

rehabilitation services and the administration of the State plan. 
Program income is considered earned when it is received.
    (2) Payments provided to a State from the Social Security 
Administration for assisting Social Security beneficiaries and 
recipients to achieve employment outcomes may also be used to carry out 
programs under part B of Title I of the Act (client assistance), part B 
of Title VI of the Act (supported employment), and Title VII of the Act 
(independent living).
    (3) The State is authorized to treat program income as--
    (i) An addition to the grant funds to be used for additional 
allowable program expenditures, in accordance with 34 CFR 80.25(g)(2); 
or
    (ii) A deduction from total allowable costs, in accordance with 34 
CFR 80.25(g)(1).
    (4) Program income cannot be used to meet the non-Federal share 
requirement under Sec.  361.60.

Sec.  361.64  Obligation of Federal funds and program income.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, any Federal 
funds, including reallotted funds, that are appropriated for a fiscal 
year to carry out a program under this part that are not obligated by 
the State by the beginning of the succeeding fiscal year and any program 
income received during a fiscal year that is not obligated by the State 
by the beginning of the succeeding fiscal year remain available for 
obligation by the State during that succeeding fiscal year.
    (b) Federal funds appropriated for a fiscal year remain available 
for obligation in the succeeding fiscal year only to the extent that the 
State met the matching requirement for those Federal funds by 
obligating, in accordance with 34 CFR 76.707, the non-Federal share in 
the fiscal year for which the funds were appropriated.

<R05>
Sec.  361.65  Allotment and payment of Federal funds for vocational rehabilitation services.

    (a) Allotment.
    (1) The allotment of Federal funds for vocational rehabilitation 
services for each State is computed in accordance with the requirements 
of section 110 of the Act, and payments are made to the State on a 
quarterly basis, unless some other period is established by the 
Secretary.
    (2) If the State plan designates one State agency to administer, or 
supervise the administration of, the part of the plan under which 
vocational rehabilitation services are provided for individuals who are 
blind and another State agency to administer the rest of the plan, the 
division of the State's allotment is a matter for State determination.
    (b) Reallotment.
    (1) The Secretary determines not later than 45 days before the end 
of a fiscal year which States, if any, will not use their full 
allotment.
    (2) As soon as possible, but not later than the end of the fiscal 
year, the Secretary reallots these funds to other States that can use 
those additional funds during the current or subsequent fiscal year, 
provided the State can meet the matching requirement by obligating the 
non-Federal share of any reallotted funds in the fiscal year for which 
the funds were appropriated.
    (3) Funds reallotted to another State are considered to be an 
increase in the

[[Page 323]]

recipient State's allotment for the fiscal year for which the funds were 
appropriated.

record of VR services in one of the following categories:
    (1) Ineligible for VR services.
    (2) Received services under an individualized plan for employment 
(IPE) and achieved an employment outcome.
    (3) Received services under an IPE but did not achieve an employment 
outcome.

Sec.  361.82  Evaluation standards.

    (a) The Secretary establishes two evaluation standards to evaluate 
the performance of each DSU that receives funds under this part. The 
evaluation standards assist the Secretary and each DSU to evaluate a 
DSU's performance in serving individuals with disabilities under the VR 
program.
    (b) A DSU must achieve successful performance on both evaluation 
standards during each performance period.
    (c) The evaluation standards for the VR program are--
    (1) Evaluation Standard 1--Employment outcomes. A DSU must assist 
any eligible individual, including an individual with a significant 
disability, to obtain, maintain, or regain high-quality employment.
    (2) Evaluation Standard 2--Equal access to services. A DSU must 
ensure that individuals from minority backgrounds have equal access to 
VR services. (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 
control number 1820-0508.)

Sec.  361.84  Performance indicators.

    (a) The performance indicators establish what constitutes minimum 
compliance with the evaluation standards.
    (b) The performance indicators require a DSU to provide information 
on a variety of factors to enable the Secretary to measure compliance 
with the evaluation standards.
    (c) The performance indicators are as follows:
    (1) Employment outcomes.
    (i) Performance Indicator 1.1. The number of individuals exiting the 
VR program who achieved an employment outcome during the current 
performance period compared to the number of individuals who exit the VR 
program after achieving an employment outcome during the previous 
performance period.
    (ii) Performance Indicator 1.2. Of all individuals who exit the VR 
program after receiving services, the percentage who are determined to 
have achieved an employment outcome.
    (iii) Performance Indicator 1.3. Of all individuals determined to 
have achieved an employment outcome, the percentage who exit the VR 
program in competitive, self-, or BEP employment with earnings 
equivalent to at least the minimum wage.
    (iv) Performance Indicator 1.4. Of all individuals who exit the VR 
program in competitive, self-, or BEP employment with earnings 
equivalent to at least the minimum wage, the percentage who are 
individuals with significant disabilities.
    (v) Performance Indicator 1.5. The average hourly earnings of all 
individuals who exit the VR program in competitive, self-, or BEP 
employment with earnings levels equivalent to at least the minimum wage 
as a ratio to the State's average hourly earnings for all individuals in 
the State who are employed (as derived from the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics report ``State Average Annual Pay'' for the most recent 
available year).
    (vi) Performance Indicator 1.6. Of all individuals who exit the VR 
program in competitive, self-, or BEP employment with earnings 
equivalent to at least the minimum wage, the difference between the 
percentage who report their own income as the largest single source of 
economic support at the time they exit the VR program and the percentage 
who report their own income as the largest single source of support at 
the time they apply for VR services.
    (2) Equal access to services.
    (i) Performance Indicator 2.1. The service rate for all individuals 
with disabilities from minority backgrounds as a ratio to the service 
rate for all non-minority individuals with disabilities.

    (1) The number of individuals who exited the VR program in each 
closure category as specified in the definition of ``Exit the VR 
program'' under Sec.  361.81.
    (2) The number of individuals who exited the VR program in 
competitive, self-, or BEP employment with earnings at or above the 
minimum wage.
    (3) The number of individuals with significant disabilities who 
exited the VR program in competitive, self-, or BEP employment with 
earnings at or above the minimum wage.
    (4) The weekly earnings and hours worked of individuals who exited 
the VR program in competitive, self-, or BEP employment with earnings at 
or above the minimum wage.
    (5) The number of individuals who exited the VR program in 
competitive, self-, or BEP employment with earnings at or above the 
minimum wage whose primary source of support at the time they applied 
for VR services was ``personal income.''
    (6) The number of individuals who exited the VR program in 
competitive, self-, or BEP employment with earnings at or above the 
minimum wage whose primary source of support at closure was ``personal 
income.''
    (7) The number of individuals exiting the VR program who are 
individuals from a minority background.
    (8) The number of non-minority individuals exiting the VR program.
    (9) The number of individuals from a minority background exiting the 
VR program after receiving services under an IPE.
    (10) The number of non-minority individuals exiting the VR program 
after receiving services under an IPE.
    (b) In lieu of the report required in paragraph (a) of this section, 
a DSU may submit its RSA-911 data on tape, diskette, or any alternative 
electronic format that is compatible with RSA's capability to process 
such an alternative, as long as the tape, diskette, or alternative 
electronic format includes the data that--
    (1) Are required by paragraph (a)(1) through (10) of this section; 
and
    (2) Meet the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c) Data reported by a DSU must be valid, accurate, and in a 
consistent format. If a DSU fails to submit data that are valid,

Sec.  361.89  Enforcement procedures.

    (a) If a DSU fails to meet the established performance levels on 
both evaluation standards as required by Sec.  361.82(b), the Secretary 
and the DSU

[[Page 328]]

must jointly develop a program improvement plan that outlines the 
specific actions to be taken by the DSU to improve program performance.
    (b) In developing the program improvement plan, the Secretary 
considers all available data and information related to the DSU's 
performance.
    (c) When a program improvement plan is in effect, review of the plan 
is conducted on a biannual basis. If necessary, the Secretary may 
request that a DSU make further revisions to the plan to improve 
performance. If the Secretary establishes new performance levels under 
Sec.  361.86(a)(2), the Secretary and the DSU must jointly modify the 
program improvement plan based on the new performance levels. The 
Secretary continues reviews and requests revisions until the DSU 
sustains satisfactory performance based on the current performance 
levels over a period of more than 1 year.
    (d) If the Secretary determines that a DSU with less than 
satisfactory performance has failed to enter into a program improvement 
plan or comply substantially with the terms and conditions of the 
program improvement plan, the Secretary, consistent with the procedures 
specified in Sec.  361.11, reduces or makes no further payments to the 
DSU under this program until the DSU has met one of these two 
requirements or raised its subsequent performance to meet the current 
overall minimum satisfactory level on the compliance indicators.

              Appendix A to Part 361--Questions and Answers

    The following questions and answers provide a summary of some of the 
most common and critical questions that we received regarding this part 
361 and the applicable responses. As is evident from the responses, we 
maintain that redefining the term ``employment outcome'' for purposes of 
the VR program to mean outcomes that occur in integrated settings will 
promote the provision of opportunities for all VR-eligible individuals 
to pursue the types of jobs that generally are available to the public.

      Is Extended Employment Still a Legitimate Employment Option?

    Yes. Employment in a sheltered setting is a legitimate and valuable 
employment option for individuals with disabilities. Implementation of 
these regulations will not change that fact. Individuals still may 
choose to pursue long-term extended employment outside of the VR 
program, and these regulations ensure that those individuals' needs are 
met by requiring the VR agency to make the necessary referral to local 
extended employment providers.

             Do the Regulations Restrict Individual Choice?

    No. We interpret the concept of individual choice in the Act as a 
choice among the employment outcomes under the VR program specified in 
the statute or by the Secretary in regulations.
    Extended employment (i.e., sheltered or non-integrated employment) 
remains both an initial step toward achieving integrated employment 
under the VR program and a long-term employment option through sources 
of support other than the VR program. In recognizing that some 
individuals with disabilities may wish to work in an extended employment 
setting, these regulations require the VR agency to ensure that these 
individuals are afforded the opportunity to do so by referring them to 
local extended employment providers. Those providers currently support 
the vast majority of sheltered workers through non-VR program resources. 
Moreover, persons wishing to prepare for integrated employment by 
initially working in an extended employment setting also may do so. In 
these cases, the VR agency cannot discontinue VR services until the 
individual transitions to integrated work in the community.

   Can State Agencies Refuse To Serve Those With the Most Significant 
                              Disabilities?

    No. Both the Act and regulations guard against that result. Persons 
with disabilities may not be excluded from the VR program based on an 
assumption or belief that the individual is incapable of working in an 
integrated setting. Rather, State units are required to establish clear 
and convincing evidence that an individual is incapable of achieving an 
employment outcome, for purposes of the VR program, and must conduct a 
trial work assessment of the individual's abilities before it can refuse 
services to any individual who it initially believes is incapable of 
working in an intergrated job setting.

 Are Homemaker and Unpaid Family Worker Considered Employment Outcomes 
                     for Purposes of the VR Program?

    Yes. The chief purpose of the regulations is to ensure that 
individuals with disabilities participating in the VR program are able 
to

[[Page 329]]

pursue the same type of employment opportunities that are available to 
the general public. Extended employment jobs, unlike homemakers and 
unpaid family workers, are primarily reserved for those with 
disabilities.

      Will the Regulations Serve To Close Down Sheltered Workshops?

    No. Sheltered workshops are primarily supported by other State, 
local, and private resources and rely very little on VR program funds. 
Persons who prefer to work in extended employment on a long-term basis 
are assured access to local extended employment programs through the 
referral requirements in the regulations. Also, those participants in 
the VR program who can best prepare for integrated employment by working 
in an extended employment setting as part of a training and assessment 
program are able to follow that path as well. Thus, extended employment 
programs and sheltered workshops continue to serve essentially the same 
role that they currently serve.

wage, but not less than the customary or usual wage paid by the employer 
for the same or similar work performed by individuals who are not 
disabled.
    (ii) Integrated setting means a setting typically found in the 
community in which an individual with the most severe disabilities 
interacts with non-disabled individuals, other than non-disabled 
individuals who are providing services to that individual, to the same 
extent that non-disabled individuals in comparable positions interact 
with other persons.
    (iii) Supported employment services means on-going support services 
provided by the designated State unit with funds under this part--
    (A) For a period not to exceed 18 months, unless under special 
circumstances a longer period to achieve job stabilization has been

an individual with the most severe disabilities makes the transition to 
extended services; and
    (B) As discrete post-employment services following transition in 
accordance with Sec.  363.4(c)(3);
    (iv) Extended services means on-going support services and other 
appropriate services provided by a State agency, a private nonprofit 
organization, employer, or any other appropriate resource, from funds

transition from State vocational rehabilitation agency support; and
    (v) Transitional employment means a series of temporary job 
placements in competitive work in an integrated work setting with on-
going support services for individuals with the most severe disabilities 
due to mental illness. In transitional employment, the provision of on-
going support services must include continuing sequential job placements 
until job permanency is achieved.
    (3) On-going support services means services that are--
    (i) Needed to support and maintain an individual with the most

placement until transition to extended services, except as provided in 
Sec.  363.4(c)(3) and, following transition, by one or more extended 
services providers throughout the individual's term of employment in a 
particular job placement or multiple placements if those placements are 
being provided under a program of transitional employment. On-going 
support services must include, at a minimum, twice-monthly monitoring at 
the work site of each individual in supported employment to assess 
employment stability, unless

[[Page 332]]

under special circumstances, especially at the request of the 
individual, the individualized written rehabilitation program provides 
for off-site monitoring, and, based upon that assessment, the 
coordination or provision of specific services at or away from the work 
site, that are needed to maintain employment stability. If off-site 
monitoring is determined to be appropriate, it must, at a minimum, 
consist of two meetings with the individual and one contact with the 
employer each month. On-going support services consist of--
    (A) Any particularized assessment needed to supplement the 
comprehensive assessment of rehabilitation needs;

   Determining Whether State Funding Equals or Exceeds Federal Funding


<R05>
Sec.  366.29  When may the Director of the designated State unit (DSU) award grants to centers?

    (a) The Director of the DSU (Director) may award grants under 
section 723 of the Act and this subpart to centers located within the 
State or in a bordering State in a fiscal year if--
    (1) The Director submits to the Secretary and obtains approval of an 
application to award grants for that fiscal year under section 723 of 
the Act and Sec.  366.32 (a) and (b); and
    (2) The Secretary determines that the amount of State funds that 
were earmarked by the State to support the general operation of centers 
meeting the requirements of part C of chapter 1 of title VII of the Act 
in the second fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the 
application is submitted equaled or exceeded the amount of funds 
allotted to the State under section 721 (c) and (d) of the Act (or part 
B of title VII of the Act as in effect on October 28, 1992) for that 
preceding fiscal year.
    (b) For purposes of section 723(a)(1)(A)(iii) of the Act and this

State submits an application to administer the CIL program is considered 
the ``preceding fiscal year.'' Example: If FY 1995 is the fiscal year 
for which the State submits an application to administer the CIL program 
under this subpart, FY 1993 is the ``preceding fiscal year.'' In 
determining the ``preceding fiscal year'' under this subpart, the

Sec.  366.30  What are earmarked funds?

    (a) For purposes of this subpart, the amount of State funds that 
were earmarked by a State to support the general operation of centers 
does not include--
    (1) Federal funds used for the general operation of centers;
    (2) State funds used to purchase specific services from a center, 
including State funds used for grants or contracts to procure or 
purchase personal assistance services or particular types of skills 
training;
    (3) State attendant care funds; or
    (4) Social Security Administration reimbursement funds.
    (b) For purposes of this subpart, earmarked funds means funds 
appropriated by the State and expressly or clearly identified as State 
expenditures in the relevant fiscal year for the sole purpose of funding 
the general operation of centers.

<R05>
Sec.  366.31  What happens if the amount of earmarked funds does not equal or exceed the amount of Federal funds for a preceding fiscal year?

    If the State submits an application to administer the CIL program 
under section 723 of the Act and this subpart for a fiscal year, but did 
not earmark the amount of State funds required by Sec.  366.29(a)(2) in 
the preceding fiscal year, the State shall be ineligible to make grants 
under section 723 of the Act and this subpart after the end of the 
fiscal year succeeding the preceding fiscal year and for each succeeding 
fiscal year.
    Example: A State meets the earmarking requirement in FY 1994. It 
also meets this requirement in FY 1995. However, in reviewing the 
State's application to administer the CIL program in FY 1998, the 
Secretary determines that the State failed to meet the earmarking 
requirement in FY 1996. The State may continue to award grants in FY

                             Awarding Grants


<R05>
Sec.  366.32  Under what circumstances may the DSU make grants?

    (a) To be eligible to award grants under this subpart and to carry 
out section 723 of the Act for a fiscal year, the Director must submit 
to the Secretary for approval an application at the time and in the 
manner that the Secretary may require and that includes, at a minimum--
    (1) Information demonstrating that the amount of funds earmarked by 
the State for the general operation of centers meets the requirements in 
Sec.  366.29(a)(1); and
    (2) A summary of the annual performance reports submitted to the 
Director from centers in accordance with Sec.  366.50(n).
    (b) If the amount of funds earmarked by the State for the general 
operation of centers meets the requirements in Sec.  366.29(a)(1), the 
Secretary approves the application and designates the Director to award 
the grants and carry out section 723 of the Act.
    (c) If the Secretary designates the Director to award grants and 
carry out section 723 of the Act under paragraph (b) of this section, 
the Director makes grants to eligible agencies in a State, as described 
in Sec.  366.2, for a fiscal year from the amount of funds allotted to 
the State under section 721(c) and (d) of the Act.
    (d)(1) In the case of a State in which there is both a DSU 
responsible for providing IL services to the general population and a 
DSU responsible for providing IL services for individuals who are blind, 
for purposes of subparts D and E of this part, the ``Director'' shall be 
the Director of the general DSU.
    (2) The State units described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section 
shall periodically consult with each other with respect to the provision 
of services for individuals who are blind.
    (e) The Director may enter into assistance contracts with centers to 
carry out section 723 of the Act. For purposes of this paragraph, an 
assistance contract is an instrument whose principal purpose is to 
transfer funds allotted to the State under section 721

[[Page 368]]

(c) and (d) of the Act and this part to an eligible agency to carry out 
section 723 of the Act. Under an assistance contract, the DSU shall 
assume a role consistent with that of the Secretary under section 722 of 
the Act. If the DSU uses an assistance contract to award funds under 
section 723 of the Act, the DSU may not add any requirements, terms, or 
conditions to the assistance contract other than those that would be 
permitted if the assistance contract were a grant rather than an 
assistance contract. Under an assistance contract, as defined in this 
paragraph, the role of the DSU is to ensure that the terms of the 
assistance contract, which are established by chapter 1 of title VII of 
the Act and the implementing regulations in this part and 34 CFR part 
364, are satisfied.
    (f) The Director may not enter into procurement contracts with 
centers to carry out section 723 of the Act. For purposes of this 
paragraph, a procurement contract is an instrument whose principal 
purpose is to acquire (by purchase, lease, or barter) property or 
services for the direct benefit or use of the DSU. Under a procurement 
contract, the DSU prescribes the specific services it intends to procure 
and the terms and conditions of the procurement.
    (g) In the enforcement of any breach of the terms and conditions of 
an assistance contract, the DSU shall follow the procedures established 
in Sec. Sec.  366.40 through 366.45.

Director shall follow the order of priorities in Sec.  366.22 for

          Subpart B--What Requirements Apply to Redesignation?


<R05>
Sec.  370.10  When do the requirements for redesignation apply?

    (a) The Governor may not redesignate the agency designated pursuant 
to section 112(c) of the Act and Sec.  370.2(b) without good cause and 
without complying with the requirements of Sec. Sec.  370.10 through 
370.17.
    (b) For purposes of Sec. Sec.  370.10 through 370.17, a 
``redesignation of'' or ``to redesignate'' a designated agency means any 
change in or transfer of the designation of an agency previously 
designated by the Governor to conduct the State's CAP to a new or 
different agency, unit, or organization, including--
    (1) A decision by a designated agency to cancel its existing 
contract with another entity with which it has previously contracted to 
carry out and operate all or part of its responsibilities under the CAP 
(including providing advisory, assistance, or advocacy services to 
eligible clients and client applicants); or
    (2) A decision by a designated agency not to renew its existing 
contract with another entity with which it has previously contracted. 
Therefore, an agency that is carrying out a State's CAP under a contract 
with a designated agency is considered a designated agency for purposes 
of Sec. Sec.  370.10 through 370.17.
    (c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, a designated 
agency that does not renew a contract for CAP services because it is 
following State procurement laws that require contracts to be awarded 
through a competitive bidding process is presumed to have good cause for 
not renewing an existing contract. However, this presumption may be 
rebutted.
    (d) If State procurement laws require a designated agency to award a 
contract through a competitive bidding process, the designated agency 
must hold public hearings on the request for proposal before awarding 
the new contract.

notice of the Governor's intention to redesignate. Both the notice to 
the designated agency, the SRAC, and the SILC and the public notice must 
include, at a minimum, the following:
    (1) The Federal requirements for the CAP (section 112 of the Act).
    (2) The goals and function of the CAP.

    (7) The name of the agency the Governor proposes to administer the 
CAP.
    (8) A description of the system that the redesignated (i.e., new)

    (b) The notice to the designated agency must--
    (1) Be given at least 30 days in advance of the Governor's written 
decision to redesignate; and

[[Page 396]]

    (2) Advise the designated agency that it has at least 30 days from 
receipt of the notice of proposed redesignation to respond to the 
Governor and that the response must be in writing.
    (c) The notice of proposed redesignation must be published in a 
place and manner that provides the SRAC, the SILC, individuals with 
disabilities or their representatives, and the public with at least 30 
days to submit oral or written comments to the Governor.
    (d) Following public notice, public hearings concerning the proposed 
redesignation must be conducted in an accessible format that provides 
individuals with disabilities or their representatives an opportunity 
for comment. The Governor shall maintain a written public record of 
these hearings.
    (e) The Governor shall fully consider any public comments before 
issuing a written decision to redesignate.

[[Page 398]]

application that includes, at a minimum--
    (1) The name of the designated agency; and
    (2) An assurance that the designated agency meets the independence 
requirement of section 112(c)(1)(A) of the Act and Sec.  370.2(c), or 
that the State is exempted from that requirement under section 
112(c)(1)(A) of the Act and Sec.  370.2(d).
    (b)(1) Each State also shall submit to the Secretary an assurance 
that the designated agency has the authority to pursue legal, 
administrative, and other appropriate remedies to ensure the protection 
of the rights of clients or client applicants within the State.
    (2) The authority to pursue remedies described in paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section must include the authority to pursue those remedies 
against the State vocational rehabilitation agency and other appropriate 
State agencies. The designated agency meets this requirement if it has 
the authority to pursue those remedies either on its own behalf or by 
obtaining necessary services, such as legal representation, from outside 
sources.
    (c) Each State also shall submit to the Secretary assurances that--
    (1) All entities conducting, administering, operating, or carrying

  Subpart D--How Does the Secretary Allocate and Reallocate Funds to a 
                                 State?


<R05>
Sec.  370.30  How does the Secretary allocate funds?

    (a) The Secretary allocates the funds available under this part for 
any fiscal year to the States on the basis of the relative population of 
each State. The Secretary allocates at least $50,000 to each State, 
unless the provisions of section 112(e)(1)(D) of the Act (which provides 
for increasing the minimum allotment if the appropriation for the CAP 
exceeds $7,500,000 or the appropriation is increased by a certain 
percentage described in section 112(e)(1)(D)(ii) of the Act) are 
applicable.
    (b) The Secretary allocates $30,000 each, unless the provisions of 
section 112(e)(1)(D) of the Act are applicable, to American Samoa, Guam, 
the Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Republic of 
Palau, except that the Secretary allocates to the Republic of Palau only 
75 percent of this allotment in fiscal year 1996, only 50 percent of 
this allotment in fiscal year 1997, only 25 percent of this allotment in 
fiscal year 1998, and none of this allotment in fiscal year 1999 and 
thereafter.
    (c) Unless prohibited or otherwise provided by State law, 
regulation, or policy, the Secretary pays to the designated agency, from 
the State allotment under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the 
amount specified in the State's approved request. Because the designated 
agency is the eventual, if not the direct, recipient of the CAP funds, 
34 CFR parts 74 and 81 apply to the designated agency, whether or not 
the designated agency is the actual recipient of the CAP grant. However, 
because it is the State that submits an application for and receives the 
CAP grant, the State remains the grantee for purposes of 34 CFR parts 76 
and 80. In addition, both the State and the designated agency are 
considered recipients for purposes of 34 CFR part 81.

whether the designated agency is making available for reallotment any of 
those CAP funds that it will be unable to obligate in that fiscal year.

    (b) If the designated agency is a private nonprofit organization, 
the designated agency shall apply the cost principles in accordance with

consistent with the program activities listed in Sec.  370.4, the cost 
of travel in connection with the provision to a client or client 
applicant of assistance under this program is allowable. The cost of 
travel includes the cost of travel for an attendant if the attendant 
must accompany the client or client applicant.
    (d) The State and the designated agency are accountable, both 
jointly and severally, to the Secretary for the proper use of funds made 
available under this part. However, the Secretary may choose to recover 
funds under the procedures in 34 CFR part 81 from either the State or 
the designated agency, or both, depending on the circumstances of each 
case.

    The CAP must be afforded reasonable access to policymaking and 
administrative personnel in State and local rehabilitation programs,

CAP may be provided that access would be to include the director of the 
designated agency among the individuals to be consulted on matters of

mediation procedures are used before resorting to formal administrative 
or legal remedies. In designing these procedures, the designated agency 
may take into account its level of resources.
    (b) For purposes of this section, mediation may involve the use of 
professional mediators, other independent third parties mutually agreed 
to by the parties to the dispute, or an employee of the designated 
agency who--
    (1) Is not assigned to advocate for or otherwise represent or is not 
involved with advocating for or otherwise representing the client or 
client applicant who is a party to the mediation; and
    (2) Has not previously advocated for or otherwise represented or

photographs, and records of evaluation, must be held strictly 
confidential.
    (b) The designated agency's use of information and records 
concerning individuals must be limited only to purposes directly 
connected with the CAP, including program evaluation activities. Except 
as provided in paragraphs (c) and (e) of this section, this information 
may not be disclosed, directly or indirectly, other than in the 
administration of the CAP, unless the consent of the individual to whom 
the information applies, or his or her parent, legal guardian, or other 
legally authorized representative or advocate (including the 
individual's advocate from the designated agency), has been obtained in 
writing. A designated agency may not produce any report, evaluation, or 
study that reveals any personally identifying information without the 
written consent of the individual or his or her representative.
    (c) Except as limited in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, the

requesting assistance under the CAP.
    (e) Notwithstanding paragraph (d) of this section and consistent 
with paragraph (f) of this section, a designated agency shall disclose 
to the Secretary, if the Secretary so requests, the identity of, or any 
other personally identifiable information (i.e., name, address, 
telephone number, social security number, or any other official code or 
number by which an individual may be readily identified) related to, any 
individual requesting assistance under the CAP if--
    (1) An audit, evaluation, monitoring review, State plan assurance 
review, or other investigation produces reliable evidence that there is 
probable cause to believe that the designated agency has violated its 
legislative mandate or misused Federal funds; or
    (2) The Secretary determines that this information may reasonably 
lead to further evidence that is directly related to alleged misconduct 
of the designated agency.
    (f) In addition to the protection afforded by paragraph (d) of this 
section, the right of a person or designated agency not to produce 
documents or disclose information to the Secretary is governed by the 
common law of privileges, as interpreted by the courts of the United 
States.

Sec.  379.53  What are the minimum performance levels for each compliance indicator?

    (a) Primary compliance indicators.
    (1) Placement rate. The project places individuals it serves into 
competitive employment as follows:
    (i) No less than 50 percent during fiscal year (FY) 2001.
    (ii) No less than 51 percent during FY 2002.
    (iii) No less than 52 percent during FY 2003.
    (iv) No less than 54 percent during FY 2004.
    (v) No less than 55 percent during FY 2005 and any year thereafter.
    (2) Change in earnings. (i) Except as provided in paragraph 
(a)(2)(ii) of this section, the average earnings of all individuals who 
are placed into competitive employment by the project increase by an 
average of at least $125.00 a week over the average earnings of all 
individuals at the time of project entry.
    (ii) For projects in which at least 75 percent of individuals placed 
into competitive employment are working fewer than 30 hours per week, 
the average earnings of all individuals placed by the project increase 
by an average of at least $100.00 a week over the average earnings of 
all individuals at the time of project entry.
    (b) Secondary compliance indicators.
    (1) Percent placed who have significant disabilities. At least 50 
percent of individuals who are placed into competitive employment are 
individuals with significant disabilities.
    (2) Percent placed who were previously unemployed. At least 50 
percent of individuals who are placed into competitive employment are 
individuals who were continuously unemployed for at least 6 months at 
the time of project entry.
    (3) Average cost per placement. The actual average cost per 
placement does not exceed 115 percent of the projected average cost per 
placement in the grantee's application.

<R05>
Sec.  379.54  What are the reporting requirements for the compliance indicators?

    (a) To receive continuation funding for the third or any subsequent 
year of a PWI grant, each grantee must submit to the Secretary data for 
the most recent complete budget period no later than 60 days after the 
end of that budget period, unless the Secretary authorizes a later 
submission date. The Secretary uses this data to determine if the 
grantee has met the program compliance indicators in this subpart F.
    (b) A grantee may receive its second year of funding (or the first 
continuation award) under this program before data from the first 
complete budget period is available. However, to allow the Secretary to 
determine whether the grantee is eligible for the third year of funding 
(or the second continuation award), the grantee must submit data from 
the first budget period in accordance with paragraph (a) of this 
section.
    (c) If the data for the most recent complete budget period provided 
under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section show that a grantee has 
failed to achieve the minimum performance levels, as required by Sec.  
379.50(b), the grantee may, at its option, submit data from the first 6 
months of the current budget period. The grantee must submit this data 
no later than 60 days after the end of that 6-month period, unless the 
Secretary authorizes a later submission date. The data must demonstrate 
that the grantee's project performance has improved sufficiently to meet 
the minimum performance levels required in Sec.  379.50(b).

              Appendix A to Part 379--Evaluation Standards

    Standard 1: The primary objective of the project must be to assist 
individuals with disabilities to obtain competitive employment. The 
activities carried out by the project must support the accomplishment of 
this objective.
    Standard 2: The project must serve individuals with disabilities 
that impair their capacity to obtain competitive employment. In 
selecting persons to receive services, priority must be given to 
individuals with significant disabilities.
    Standard 3: The project must ensure the provision of services that 
will assist in the placement of individuals with disabilities.
    Standard 4: Funds must be used to achieve the project's primary 
objective at minimum cost to the Federal Government.
    Standard 5: The project's advisory council must provide policy 
guidance and assistance in the conduct of the project.
    Standard 6: Working relationships, including partnerships, must be 
established with agencies and organizations to expand the project's 
capacity to meet its objectives.
    Standard 7: The project must obtain positive results in assisting 
individuals with disabilities to obtain competitive employment.

           Appendix B to Part 379--Presumption of Eligibility

    If a DSU determines that an individual is an eligible individual 
under section 102(a) of the Act, including that the individual meets the 
definition of an ``individual with a significant disability,'' and 
refers the individual to a PWI project, the PWI grantee may initiate 
services to that individual without the need for an additional 
determination of eligibility. In these instances, the PWI grantee should 
obtain appropriate documentation of this determination from the DSU.

      Appendix C to Part 379--Calculating Required Matching Amount

    1. The method for calculating the required matching amount may be 
stated by the following formula:

X = (Y / .8) - Y
X = Required Match (provided in cash or through third party in-kind 
          contributions)
Y = Amount of Federal Funds

    This equation holds true regardless of the total cost of the 
project. The amount of Federal funds spent in a fiscal year (FY) can 
never be more than 80 percent (hence, the ``.8'' in the formula) of the 
total funds (Federal and non-Federal) spent by the project. Thus, the 
formula is not dependent on knowing the total cost of the project. One 
needs to know only that the Federal share can be no more than 80 percent 
of whatever the total costs may turn out to be. In all cases, the 
matching contribution is calculated by dividing the amount of the 
Federal grant award by 80 percent (.8) and subtracting from that result 
the amount of the Federal grant award.
    For example: If the amount of the Federal PWI grant award is 
$400,000, the amount of the required match is $100,000, calculated as 
follows:

 
 
                                                                                            (Am't. of Fed. Funds
    Required match      =    (Am't. of Fed. Funds in FY    /   Max. Fed. % of Total)   -           in FY)
 
X                       =   ($400,000...................   /   .8)                     -   400,000
X                       =   $500,000-400,000............
X                       =   $100,000....................
 

    The matching contribution is never simply 20 percent of the amount 
of the Federal grant award (i.e., in the above example, NOT .2 x 
$400,000).
    2. Another consideration is what happens if a grantee carries over 
unspent Federal funds it received in a fiscal year. If the grantee 
spends or obligates less than the amount of its Federal grant award in a 
particular fiscal year and carries over the unspent or unobligated 
amount of its Federal grant award, its required matching contribution 
stays the same because the amount of its required matching expenditures 
or obligations is based on the amount of Federal dollars received in a 
particular fiscal year. That is, if the grantee carries over any unspent 
or unobligated Federal funds, the grantee must have spent or obligated 
the amount of non-Federal funds required for its matching contribution 
in the same fiscal year in which the Federal funds were received.
    For example: If a PWI grantee receives a grant award of $80,000 in 
FY 2000, its matching requirement for these funds is $20,000. If the 
grantee spends and obligates only $64,000 in FY 2000, it may ``carry 
over'' $16,000 to FY 2001. However, the grantee must spend or obligate 
$20,000 in non-Federal funds in FY 2000 to meet its matching 
requirements for the $80,000 it received in FY 2000, even though it does 
not spend or obligate the entire $80,000 in FY 2000. If the grantee 
fails to spend or obligate in FY 2000 the entire $20,000 in non-

[[Page 430]]

Federal funds, the grantee will fail to meet the matching requirement 
for the $80,000 it received in FY 2000 and may not carry over the 
unspent or unobligated $16,000 to FY 2001.
    3. The matching contribution also must comply with the requirements 
of 34 CFR 74.23 (for grantees that are institutions of higher education, 
hospitals, or other nonprofit organizations) or 34 CFR 80.24 (for 
grantees that are State, local, or Indian tribal governments). The term 
``third party in-kind contributions'' is defined in either 34 CFR 74.2 
or 34 CFR 80.3, as applicable to the type of grantee.

    (B) For which an individual is compensated at or above the minimum 
wage, but not less than the customary or usual wage paid by the employer 
for the same or similar work performed by individuals who are not 
disabled.
    (ii) Integrated setting means a setting typically found in the 
community in which an individual with the most severe disabilities 
interacts with non-disabled individuals, other than non-disabled 
individuals who are providing services to that individual, to the same 
extent that non-disabled individuals in comparable positions interact

extended services; and

[[Page 433]]

    (B) As discrete post-employment services following transition in 
accordance with 34 CFR 363.4(c)(3);

    (v) Transitional employment means a series of temporary job 
placements in competitive work in an integrated work setting with on-
going support services for individuals with the most severe disabilities

<R05>
Sec.  395.4  State rules and regulations.

    (a) The State licensing agency shall promulgate rules and 
regulations which have been approved by the Secretary and which shall be 
adequate to assure the effective conduct of the State's vending facility 
program (including State licensing agency procedures covering the 
conduct of full evidentiary hearings) and the operation of each vending 
facility in accordance with this part and with the requirements and 
conditions of each department, agency, and instrumentality in control of 
the maintenance, operation, and protection of Federal property, 
including the conditions contained in permits, as well as in all 
applicable Federal and State laws, local ordinances and regulations.
    (b) Such rules and regulations and amendments thereto shall be filed 
or published in accordance with State law.
    (c) Such rules and regulations shall include provisions adequate to 
insure that the right, title to, and interest in each vending facility 
used in the program and the stock will be vested in accordance with the 
laws of the State in only the following:
    (1) The State licensing agency; or
    (2) Its nominee, subject to the conditions specified in Sec.  
395.15(b); or
    (3) The vendor, in accordance with State determination.
    (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section, 
any right, title to, or interest which existed on June 30, 1955, in 
stock may continue so long as:
    (1) The interest is in the stock of a facility established under the 
program prior to July 1, 1955, and
    (2) The vendor was licensed in the program (whether or not for the 
operation of the vending facility in question) prior to July 1, 1955.


<R05>
Sec.  395.5  Approval of application for designation as State licensing agency.

    When the Secretary determines that an application submitted by a 
State

[[Page 466]]

vocational rehabilitation agency under Sec.  395.2, and the accompanying 
rules and regulations indicate a plan of program operations which will 
stimulate and enlarge the economic opportunities for the blind, and 
which will meet all other requirements of this part, he shall approve 
the application and shall designate the applying State vocational 
rehabilitation agency as the State licensing agency.


<R05>
Sec.  395.6  Vendor ownership of vending facilities.

    (a) If a State licensing agency determines under Sec.  395.4(c) that 
the right, title to, and interest in a vending facility may be vested in 
the blind vendor, the State licensing agency shall enter into a written 
agreement with each vendor who is to have such ownership. Such agreement 
shall contain in full the terms and conditions governing such ownership 
in accordance with criteria in the State licensing agency's regulations, 
this part, and the terms and conditions of the permit. The criteria 
established to govern the determination that the title may be so vested 
shall contain reasonable provisions to enable a vendor to purchase 
vending facility equipment and to ensure that no individual will be 
denied the opportunity to become a vendor because of his inability to 
purchase the vending facility equipment or the initial stock;
    (b) The State licensing agency shall establish in writing and 
maintain policies determining whether the vendor-owner or the State 
licensing agency shall be required to maintain the vending facility in 
good repair and in an attractive condition and replace worn-out or 
obsolete equipment; and if the former, such policies shall provide that 
upon such vendor-owner's failure to do so, the State licensing agency 
may make the necessary maintenance, replacement, or repairs and make 
equitable arrangements for reimbursement;
    (c) Where the vendor owns such equipment and is required to maintain 
the vending facility in good repair and in an attractive condition and 
replace worn-out or obsolete equipment, or agrees to purchase additional 
new equipment, service charges for such purposes shall be equitably 
reduced and the method for determining such amount shall be established 
by the State licensing agency in writing;
    (d) Where the vendor owns such equipment, the State licensing agency 
shall retain a first option to repurchase such equipment, and in the 
event the vendor-owner dies, or for any other reason ceases to be a 
licensee, or transfers to another vending facility, ownership of such 
equipment shall become vested in the State licensing agency for transfer 
to a successor licensee subject to an obligation on its part to pay to 
such vendor-owner or his estate, the fair value therein; and
    (e) The vendor-owner, his personal representative or next of kin 
shall be entitled to an opportunity for a full evidentiary hearing with 
respect to the determination of the amount to be paid by the State 
licensing agency for a vendor's ownership in the equipment. When the 
vendor-owner is dissatisfied with any decision rendered as a result of 
such hearing, he may file a complaint with the Secretary under Sec.  
395.13 to request the convening of an ad hoc arbitration panel.


<R05>
Sec.  395.7  The issuance and conditions of licenses.

    (a) The State licensing agency shall establish in writing and 
maintain objective criteria for licensing qualified applicants, 
including a provision for giving preference to blind persons who are in 
need of employment. Such criteria shall also include provisions to 
assure that licenses will be issued only to persons who are determined 
by the State licensing agency to be:
    (1) Blind;
    (2) Citizens of the United States; and
    (3) Certified by the State vocational rehabilitation agency as 
qualified to operate a vending facility.
    (b) The State licensing agency shall provide for the issuance of 
licenses for an indefinite period but subject to suspension or 
termination if, after affording the vendor an opportunity for a full 
evidentiary hearing, the State licensing agency finds that the vending 
facility is not being operated in accordance with its rules and 
regulations, the terms and conditions of the permit, and the terms and 
conditions of the agreement with the vendor.

[[Page 467]]

    (c) The State licensing agency shall further establish in writing 
and maintain policies which have been developed with the active 
participation of the State Committee of Blind Vendors and which govern 
the duties, supervision, transfer, promotion, and financial 
participation of the vendors. The State licensing agency shall also 
establish procedures to assure that such policies have been explained to 
each blind vendor.


<R05>
Sec.  395.8  Distribution and use of income from vending machines on Federal property.

    (a) Vending machine income from vending machines on Federal property 
which has been disbursed to the State licensing agency by a property 
managing department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States 
under Sec.  395.32 shall accrue to each blind vendor operating a vending 
facility on such Federal property in each State in an amount not to 
exceed the average net income of the total number of blind vendors 
within such State, as determined each fiscal year on the basis of each 
prior year's operation, except that vending machine income shall not 
accrue to any blind vendor in any amount exceeding the average net 
income of the total number of blind vendors in the United States. No 
blind vendor shall receive less vending machine income than he was 
receiving during the calendar year prior to January 1, 1974, as a direct 
result of any limitation imposed on such income under this paragraph. No 
limitation shall be imposed on income from vending machines, combined to 
create a vending facility, when such facility is maintained, serviced, 
or operated by a blind vendor. Vending machine income disbursed by a 
property managing department, agency or instrumentality of the United 
States to a State licensing agency in excess of the amounts eligible to 
accrue to blind vendors in accordance with this paragraph shall be 
retained by the appropriate State licensing agency.
    (b) The State licensing agency shall disburse vending machine income 
to blind vendors within the State on at least a quarterly basis.
    (c) Vending machine income which is retained under paragraph (a) of 
this section by a State licensing agency shall be used by such agency 
for the establishment and maintenance of retirement or pension plans, 
for health insurance contributions, and for the provision of paid sick 
leave and vacation time for blind vendors in such State, if it is so 
determined by a majority vote of blind vendors licensed by the State 
licensing agency, after such agency has provided to each such vendor 
information on all matters relevant to such purposes. Any vending 
machine income not necessary for such purposes shall be used by the 
State licensing agency for the maintenance and replacement of equipment, 
the purchase of new equipment, management services, and assuring a fair 
minimum return to vendors. Any assessment charged to blind vendors by a 
State licensing agency shall be reduced pro rata in an amount equal to 
the total of such remaining vending machine income.


<R05>
Sec.  395.9  The setting aside of funds by the State licensing agency.

    (a) The State licensing agency shall establish in writing the extent 
to which funds are to be set aside or caused to be set aside from the 
net proceeds of the operation of the vending facilities and, to the 
extent applicable, from vending machine income under Sec.  395.8(c) in 
an amount determined by the Secretary to be reasonable.
    (b) Funds may be set aside under paragraph (a) of this section only 
for the purposes of:
    (1) Maintenance and replacement of equipment;
    (2) The purchase of new equipment;
    (3) Management services;
    (4) Assuring a fair minimum of return to vendors; or
    (5) The establishment and maintenance of retirement or pension 
funds, health insurance contributions, and provision for paid sick leave 
and vacation time, if it is so determined by a majority vote of blind 
vendors licensed by the State licensing agency, after such agency 
provides to each such vendor information on all matters relevant to such 
proposed purposes.

[[Page 468]]

    (c) The State licensing agency shall further set out the method of 
determining the charge for each of the above purposes listed in 
paragraph (b) of this section, which will be determined with the active 
participation of the State Committee of Blind Vendors and which will be 
designed to prevent, so far as is practicable, a greater charge for any 
purpose than is reasonably required for that purpose. The State 
licensing agency shall maintain adequate records to support the 
reasonableness of the charges for each of the purposes listed in this 
section, including any reserves necessary to assure that such purposes 
can be achieved on a consistent basis.


<R05>
Sec.  395.10  The maintenance and replacement of vending facility equipment.

    The State licensing agency shall maintain (or cause to be 
maintained) all vending facility equipment in good repair and in an 
attractive condition and shall replace or cause to be replaced worn-out 
and obsolete equipment as required to ensure the continued successful 
operation of the facility.


<R05>
Sec.  395.11  Training program for blind individuals.

    The State licensing agency shall ensure that effective programs of 
vocational and other training services, including personal and 
vocational adjustment, books, tools, and other training materials, shall 
be provided to blind individuals as vocational rehabilitation services 
under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Pub. L. 93-112), as amended by the 
Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1974 (Pub. L. 93-516). Such programs 
shall include on-the-job training in all aspects of vending facility 
operation for blind persons with the capacity to operate a vending 
facility, and upward mobility training (including further education and 
additional training or retraining for improved work opportunities) for 
all blind licensees. The State licensing agency shall further ensure 
that post-employment services shall be provided to blind vendors as 
vocational rehabilitation services as necessary to assure that the 
maximum vocational potential of such vendors is achieved and suitable 
employment is maintained within the State's vending facility program.


<R05>
Sec.  395.12  Access to program and financial information.

    Each blind vendor under this part shall be provided access to all 
financial data of the State licensing agency relevant to the operation 
of the State vending facility program, including quarterly and annual 
financial reports, provided that such disclosure does not violate 
applicable Federal or State laws pertaining to the disclosure of 
confidential information. Insofar as practicable, such data shall be 
made available in braille or recorded tape. At the request of a blind 
vendor State licensing agency staff shall arrange a convenient time to 
assist in the interpretation of such financial data.


<R05>
Sec.  395.13  Evidentiary hearings and arbitration of vendor complaints.

    (a) The State licensing agency shall specify in writing and maintain 
procedures whereby such agency affords an opportunity for a full 
evidentiary hearing to each blind vendor (which procedures shall also 
apply to cases under Sec.  395.6(e)) dissatisfied with any State 
licensing agency action arising from the operation or administration of 
the vending facility program. When such blind vendor is dissatisfied 
with any action taken or decision rendered as a result of such hearing, 
he may file a complaint with the Secretary. Such complaint shall be 
accompanied by all available supporting documents, including a statement 
of the decision which was rendered and the reasons in support thereof.
    (b) The filing of a complaint under paragraph (a) of this section 
with either the State licensing agency or the Secretary shall indicate 
consent by the blind vendor for the release of such information as is 
necessary for the conduct of a full evidentiary hearing or the hearing 
of an ad hoc arbitration panel.
    (c) Upon receipt of a complaint filed by a blind vendor which meets 
the requirements established by the Secretary, the Secretary shall 
convene an ad hoc arbitration panel which shall, in accordance with the 
provisions of 5 U.S.C. chapter 5, subchapter II, give notice, conduct a 
hearing, and render its decision which shall be final and binding on the 
parties except that such

[[Page 469]]

decision shall be subject to appeal and review as a final agency action 
for purposes of the provisions of 5 U.S.C. chapter 7.
    (d) The arbitration panel convened by the Secretary to hear the 
grievances of blind vendors shall be composed of three members appointed 
as follows:
    (1) One individual designated by the State licensing agency;
    (2) One individual designated by the blind vendor; and
    (3) One individual not employed by the State licensing agency or, 
where appropriate, its parent agency, who shall be jointly designated by 
the other members of the panel and who shall serve as chairman of the 
panel.
    (e) If either the State licensing agency or the blind vendor fails 
to designate a member of an arbitration panel, the Secretary shall 
designate such member on behalf of such party.
    (f) The decisions of an arbitration panel convened by the Secretary 
under this section shall be matters of public record and shall be 
published in the Federal Register.
    (g) The Secretary shall pay all reasonable costs of arbitration 
under this section in accordance with a schedule of fees and expenses 
which shall be published in the Federal Register.
    (h) The provisions of this section shall not require the 
participation of grantors of permits for the operation of vending 
facilities on property other than Federal property.


<R05>
Sec.  395.14  The State Committee of Blind Vendors.

    (a) The State licensing agency shall provide for the biennial 
election of a State Committee of Blind Vendors which, to the extent 
possible, shall be fully representative of all blind vendors in the 
State program on the basis of such factors as geography and vending 
facility type with a goal of providing for proportional representation 
of blind vendors on Federal property and blind vendors on other 
property. Participation by any blind vendor in any election shall not be 
conditioned upon the payment of dues or any other fees.
    (b) The State Committee of Blind Vendors shall:
    (1) Actively participate with the State licensing agency in major 
administrative decisions and policy and program development decisions 
affecting the overall administration of the State's vending facility 
program;
    (2) Receive and transmit to the State licensing agency grievances at 
the request of blind vendors and serve as advocates for such vendors in 
connection with such grievances;
    (3) Actively participate with the State licensing agency in the 
development and administration of a State system for the transfer and 
promotion of blind vendors;
    (4) Actively participate with the State licensing agency in the 
development of training and retraining programs for blind vendors; and
    (5) Sponsor, with the assistance of the State licensing agency, 
meetings and instructional conferences for blind vendors within the 
State.


<R05>
Sec.  395.15  Use of nominee agreements.

    (a) The State licensing agency may enter into an agreement whereby 
another agency or organization undertakes to furnish services to blind 
vendors. Such agreement shall be in writing and shall contain provisions 
which:
    (1) Clearly insure the retention by the State licensing agency of 
full responsibility for the administration and operation of all phases 
of the program;
    (2) Specify the type and extent of the services to be provided under 
such agreement;
    (3) Provide that no set-aside charges will be collected from blind 
vendors except as specified in such agreement;
    (4) Specify that no nominee will be allowed to exercise any function 
with respect to funds for the purchase of new equipment or for assuring 
a fair minimum of return to vendors, except to collect and hold solely 
for disposition in accordance with the order of the State licensing 
agency any charges authorized for those purposes by the licensing 
agency; and
    (5) Specify that only the State licensing agency shall have control 
with respect to selection, placement, transfer, financial participation 
and termination of the vendors, and the preservation, utilization, and 
disposition of program assets.

[[Page 470]]

    (b) If the State licensing agency permits any agency or organization 
other than a vendor to hold any right, title to, or interest in vending 
facilities or stock, the arrangement shall be one permitted by State law 
and shall specify in writing that all such right, title to, or interest 
is held by such agency or organization as the nominee of the State 
licensing agency for program purposes and subject to the paramount right 
of the State licensing agency to direct and control the use, transfer, 
and disposition of such vending facilities or stock.


<R05>
Sec.  395.16  Permit for the establishment of vending facilities.

    Prior to the establishment of each vending facility, other than a 
cafeteria, the State licensing agency shall submit an application for a 
permit setting forth the location, the amount of space necessary for the 
operation of the vending facility; the type of facility and equipment, 
the number, location and type of vending machines and other terms and 
conditions desired to be included in the permit. Such application shall 
be submitted for the approval of the head of the Federal property 
managing department, agency, or instrumentality. When an application is 
not approved, the head of the Federal property managing department, 
agency, or instrumentality shall advise the State licensing agency in 
writing and shall indicate the reasons for the disapproval.


<R05>
Sec.  395.17  Suspension of designation as State licensing agency.

    (a) If the Secretary has reason to believe that, in the 
administration of the program, there is a failure on the part of any 
State licensing agency to comply substantially with the Act and this 
part, he shall so inform such agency in writing, setting forth, in 
detail, the areas in which there is such failure and giving it a 
reasonable opportunity to comply.
    (b) If, after the lapse of a reasonable time, the Secretary is of 
the opinion that such failure to comply still continues and that the 
State licensing agency is not taking the necessary steps to comply, he 
shall offer to such agency, by reasonable notice in writing thereto and 
to the chief executive of the State, an opportunity for a hearing before 
the Secretary (or person designated by the Secretary) to determine 
whether there is a failure on the part of such agency to comply 
substantially with the provisions of the Act and of this part.
    (c) If it is thereupon determined that there is a failure on the 
part of such agency to comply substantially with the Act and this part, 
appropriate written notice shall be given to such agency and to the 
chief executive of the State suspending such agency's designation as 
licensing agency effective 90 days from the date of such notice. A copy 
of such written notice shall be given to each department, agency, or 
instrumentality of the United States responsible for the maintenance, 
operation, and protection of Federal property on which vending machines 
subject to the requirements of Sec.  395.32 are located in the State. 
Upon the suspension of such designation, vending machine income from 
vending machines on Federal property due for accrual to the State 
licensing agency under Sec.  395.32 shall be retained in escrow by such 
department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States responsible 
for the maintenance, operation and protection of the Federal property on 
which such vending machines are located, pending redesignation of the 
State licensing agency or rescission of the suspension under paragraph 
(e) of this section.
    (d) If, before the expiration of such 90 days, the Secretary (or 
person designated by him) determines that the State licensing agency is 
taking the necessary steps to comply, he may postpone the effective date 
of such suspension for such time as he deems necessary in the best 
interest of the program.
    (e) If, prior to the effective date of such suspension, the 
Secretary (or person designated by him) finds that there is no longer a 
failure on the part of the State licensing agency to comply 
substantially with the provisions of the Act and this part, he shall so 
notify the agency, the chief executive of the State, and each Federal 
department, agency, or instrumentality required to place funds in escrow 
under paragraph

[[Page 471]]

(c) of this section, in which event the suspension of the designation 
shall not become effective and the requirement to place funds in escrow 
shall be terminated.


<R04>
                 Subpart C--Federal Property Management


<R05>
Sec.  395.30  The location and operation of vending facilities for blind vendors on Federal property.

    (a) Each department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States 
in control of the maintenance, operation, and protection of Federal 
property shall take all steps necessary to assure that, wherever 
feasible, in light of appropriate space and potential patronage, one or 
more vending facilities for operation by blind licensees shall be 
located on all Federal property Provided that the location or operation 
of such facility or facilities would not adversely affect the interests 
of the United States. Blind persons licensed by State licensing agencies 
shall be given priority in the operation of vending facilities on any 
Federal property.
    (b) Any limitation on the location or operation of a vending 
facility for blind vendors by a department, agency or instrumentality of 
the United States based on a finding that such location or operation or 
type of location or operation would adversely affect the interests of 
the United States shall be fully justified in writing to the Secretary 
who shall determine whether such limitation is warranted. A 
determination made by the Secretary concerning such limitation shall be 
binding on any department, agency, or instrumentality of the United 
States affected by such determination. The Secretary shall publish such 
determination in the Federal Register along with supporting documents 
directly relating to the determination.
    (c) Priority in the operation of vending facilities in areas 
administered by the National Park Service or the National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration shall be given to blind vendors. Priority in 
the awarding of contracts for the operation of concessions in such areas 
when such concessions provide accommodations, facilities, and services 
of a scope or of a character not generally available in vending 
facilities operated by blind vendors shall be given in accordance with 
the provisions of the Concession Policy Act (Pub. L. 98-249, 16 U.S.C. 
1) or the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, as amended (Pub. 
L. 85-568, 42 U.S.C. 2473). The provisions of this part shall not apply 
when all accommodations, facilities, or services in such areas are 
operated by a single responsible concessioner.


<R05>
Sec.  395.31  Acquisition and occupation of Federal property.

    (a) Effective January 2, 1975, no department, agency, or 
instrumentality of the United States shall undertake to acquire by 
ownership, rent, or lease, or to otherwise occupy, in whole or in part, 
any building unless it is determined that such building includes a 
satisfactory site or sites for the location and operation of a vending 
facility by a blind vendor. In those cases where a purchase contract, an 
agreement to lease, or other similar commitment was entered into prior 
to January 2, 1975, the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply.
    (b) Effective January 2, 1975, no department, agency, or 
instrumentality of the United States, shall undertake to occupy, in 
whole or in part, any building which is to be constructed, substantially 
altered, or renovated, or in the case of a building which is occupied on 
January 2, 1975 by a department, agency, or instrumentality of the 
United States, no such department, agency, or instrumentality shall 
undertake to substantially alter or renovate such building, unless it is 
determined that the design for such construction, substantial 
alteration, or renovation includes a satisfactory site or sites for the 
location and operation of a vending facility by a blind vendor. In those 
cases where a design contract or other similar commitment was entered 
into prior to January 2, 1975, the provisions of this paragraph shall 
not apply. For purposes of this paragraph, substantial alteration or 
renovation of a building means a permanent material change in the floor 
area of such building which would render such building appropriate for 
the location and operation of a vending facility by a blind vendor.

[[Page 472]]

    (c) The determination that a building contains a satisfactory site 
or sites under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section shall be made after 
consultation between the State licensing agency and the head of the 
department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States which is 
planning to acquire or otherwise occupy such building. In order to make 
such determination, effective on the publication date of this part each 
such department, agency, or instrumentality shall provide to the 
appropriate State licensing agency written notice of its intention to 
acquire or otherwise occupy such building. Such written notice shall be 
by certified or registered mail with return receipt and shall be 
provided as early as practicable but no later than 60 days prior to such 
intended action. The written notice shall indicate that a satisfactory 
site or sites for the location and operation of a vending facility by 
blind persons is included in the plans for the building to be acquired 
or otherwise occupied and shall further assure that the State licensing 
agency shall be afforded the opportunity to determine whether such 
building includes a satisfactory site or sites for a vending facility. 
The written notice shall further assure that the State licensing agency, 
subject to the approval of the head of the Federal property managing 
department, agency, or instrumentality, shall be offered the opportunity 
to select the location and type of vending facility to be operated by a 
blind vendor prior to the completion of the final space layout of the 
building. The receipt of such written notice shall be acknowledged in 
writing promptly by the State licensing agency but no later than within 
30 days and the State licensing agency shall indicate at that time 
whether it is interested in establishing a vending facility. A copy of 
the written notice to the State licensing agency and the State licensing 
agency's acknowledgement shall be provided to the Secretary.
    (d) When, after a written notice has been provided under paragraph 
(c) of this section, the State licensing agency determines that the 
number of persons using the Federal property is or will be insufficient 
to support a vending facility, and the Secretary concurs with such 
determination, the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section 
shall not apply. The provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section shall also not apply when fewer than 100 Federal Government 
employees are or will be located during normal working hours in the 
building to be acquired or otherwise occupied or when such building

vending machines within operated retail sales outlets under the control 
of post exchange or ships' stores systems authorized under title 10 
U.S.C.; to income from vending machines operated by the Veterans Canteen

Sec.  395.33  Operation of cafeterias by blind vendors.

    (a) Priority in the operation of cafeterias by blind vendors on 
Federal property shall be afforded when the Secretary determines, on an 
individual basis, and after consultation with the appropriate property 
managing department, agency, or instrumentality, that such operation can 
be provided at a reasonable cost, with food of a high quality comparable 
to that currently provided employees, whether by contract or otherwise. 
Such operation shall be expected to provide maximum employment 
opportunities to blind vendors to the greatest extent possible.
    (b) In order to establish the ability of blind vendors to operate a 
cafeteria in such a manner as to provide food service at comparable cost 
and of comparable high quality as that available from other providers of 
cafeteria services, the appropriate State licensing agency shall be 
invited to respond to solicitations for offers when a cafeteria contract 
is contemplated by the appropriate property managing department, agency, 
or instrumentality. Such solicitations for offers shall establish 
criteria under which all responses will be judged. Such criteria may 
include sanitation practices, personnel, staffing, menu pricing and 
portion sizes, menu variety, budget and accounting practices. If the 
proposal received from the State licensing agency is judged to be within 
a competitive range and has been ranked among those proposals which have 
a reasonable chance of being selected for final award, the property 
managing department, agency, or instrumentality shall consult with the 
Secretary as required under paragraph (a) of this section. If the State 
licensing agency is dissatisfied with an action taken relative to its 
proposal, it may file a complaint with the Secretary under the 
provisions of Sec.  395.37.
    (c) All contracts or other existing arrangements pertaining to the 
operation of cafeterias on Federal property not covered by contract 
with, or by permits issued to, State licensing agencies shall be 
renegotiated subsequent to the effective date of this part on or before 
the expiration of such contracts or other arrangements pursuant to the 
provisions of this section.
    (d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of 
this section, Federal property managing departments, agencies, and 
instrumentalities may afford priority in the operation of cafeterias by 
blind vendors on Federal property through direct negotiations with State 
licensing agencies whenever such department, agency, or instrumentality 
determines, on an individual basis, that such operation can be provided 
at a reasonable cost, with food of a high quality comparable to that 
currently provided employees: Provided, however, That the provisions of 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall apply in the event that the 
negotiations authorized by this paragraph do not result in a contract.

maintenance of the Federal property; and
    (3) Articles sold at vending facilities operated by blind licensees
