                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1
    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, July 1, 1998), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication 
in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and 
parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

<R05>
Sec. 300.7  Children with disabilities.

    (a)(1) As used in this part, the term ``children with disabilities'' 
means those children evaluated in accordance with Secs. 300.530-300.534 
as having mental retardation, hearing impairments including deafness, 
speech or language impairments, visual impairments including blindness, 
serious emotional disturbance, orthopedic impairments, autism, traumatic 
brain injury, other health impairments, specific learning disabilities, 
deaf-blindness, or multiple disabilities, and who because of those 
impairments need special education and related services.
    (2) The term ``children with disabilities'' for children aged 3 
through 5 may, at a State's discretion, include children--
    (i) Who are experiencing developmental delays, as defined by the 
State and as measured by appropriate diagnostic instruments and 
procedures, in one or more of the following areas: physical development, 
cognitive development, communication development, social or emotional 
development, or adaptive development; and
    (ii) Who, for that reason, need special education and related 
services.
    (b) The terms used in this definition are defined as follows:
    (1) ``Autism'' means a developmental disability significantly 
affecting verbal and nonverbal communication and social interaction, 
generally evident before age 3, that adversely affects a child's 
educational performance. Other characteristics often associated with 
autism are engagement in repetitive activities and stereotyped 
movements, resistance to environmental change or change in daily 
routines, and unusual responses to sensory experiences. The term does 
not apply if a child's educational performance is adversely affected 
primarily because the child has a serious emotional disturbance, as 
defined in paragraph (b)(9) of this section.
    (2) ``Deaf-blindness'' means concomitant hearing and visual 
impairments, the combination of which causes such severe communication 
and other developmental and educational problems that they cannot be 
accommodated in special education programs solely for children with 
deafness or children with blindness.
    (3) ``Deafness'' means a hearing impairment that is so severe that 
the child is impaired in processing linguistic information through 
hearing, with or without amplification, that adversely affects a child's 
educational performance.
    (4) ``Hearing impairment'' means an impairment in hearing, whether 
permanent or fluctuating, that adversely affects a child's educational 
performance but that is not included under the definition of deafness in 
this section.
    (5) ``Mental retardation'' means significantly subaverage general 
intellectual functioning existing concurrently with deficits in adaptive 
behavior and manifested during the developmental period that adversely 
affects a child's educational performance.
    (6) ``Multiple disabilities'' means concomitant impairments (such as 
mental retardation-blindness, mental retardation-orthopedic impairment, 
etc.), the combination of which causes such severe educational problems 
that they cannot be accommodated in special education programs solely 
for one of the impairments. The term does not include deaf-blindness.
    (7) ``Orthopedic impairment'' means a severe orthopedic impairment 
that adversely affects a child's educational performance. The term 
includes impairments caused by congenital anomaly (e.g., clubfoot, 
absence of some member, etc.), impairments caused by disease (e.g., 
poliomyelitis, bone tuberculosis, etc.), and impairments from other 
causes (e.g., cerebral palsy, amputations, and fractures or burns that 
cause contractures).
    (8) ``Other health impairment'' means having limited strength, 
vitality or alertness, due to chronic or acute health problems such as a 
heart condition, tuberculosis, rheumatic fever, nephritis, asthma, 
sickle cell anemia, hemophilia, epilepsy, lead poisoning, leukemia, or 
diabetes that adversely affects a child's educational performance.
    (9) ``Serious emotional disturbance'' is defined as follows:
    (i) The term means a condition exhibiting one or more of the 
following

[[Page 15]]

characteristics over a long period of time and to a marked degree that 
adversely affects a child's educational performance--
    (A) An inability to learn that cannot be explained by intellectual, 
sensory, or health factors;
    (B) An inability to build or maintain satisfactory interpersonal 
relationships with peers and teachers;
    (C) Inappropriate types of behavior or feelings under normal 
circumstances;
    (D) A general pervasive mood of unhappiness or depression; or
    (E) A tendency to develop physical symptoms or fears associated with 
personal or school problems.
    (ii) The term includes schizophrenia. The term does not apply to 
children who are socially maladjusted, unless it is determined that they 
have a serious emotional disturbance.
    (10) ``Specific learning disability'' means a disorder in one or 
more of the basic psychological processes involved in understanding or 
in using language, spoken or written, that may manifest itself in an 
imperfect ability to listen, think, speak, read, write, spell, or to do 
mathematical calculations. The term includes such conditions as 
perceptual disabilities, brain injury, minimal brain dysfunction, 
dyslexia, and developmental aphasia. The term does not apply to children 
who have learning problems that are primarily the result of visual, 
hearing, or motor disabilities, of mental retardation, of emotional 
disturbance, or of environmental, cultural, or economic disadvantage.
    (11) ``Speech or language impairment'' means a communication 
disorder such as stuttering, impaired articulation, a language 
impairment, or a voice impairment that adversely affects a child's 
educational performance.
    (12) ``Traumatic brain injury'' means an acquired injury to the 
brain caused by an external physical force, resulting in total or 
partial functional disability or psychosocial impairment, or both, that 
adversely affects a child's educational performance. The term applies to 
open or closed head injuries resulting in impairments in one or more 
areas, such as cognition; language; memory; attention; reasoning; 
abstract thinking; judgment; problem-solving; sensory, perceptual and 
motor abilities; psychosocial behavior; physical functions; information 
processing; and speech. The term does not apply to brain injuries that 
are congenital or degenerative, or brain injuries induced by birth 
trauma.
    (13) ``Visual impairment including blindness'' means an impairment 
in vision that, even with correction, adversely affects a child's 
educational performance. The term includes both partial sight and 
blindness.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1401(a)(1))


    Note: If a child manifests characteristics of the disability 
category ``autism'' after age 3, that child still could be diagnosed as 
having ``autism'' if the criteria in paragraph (b)(1) of this section 
are satisfied.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1401(a)(17))


    Note: With respect to related services, the Senate Report states:
    The Committee bill provides a definition of related services, making 
clear that all such related services may not be required for each 
individual child and that such term includes early identification and 
assessment of handicapping conditions and the provision of services to 
minimize the effects of such conditions.

(S. Rep. No. 94-168, p. 12 (1975))

    The list of related services is not exhaustive and may include other 
developmental, corrective, or supportive services (such as artistic and 
cultural programs, and art, music, and dance therapy), if they are 
required to assist a child with a disability to benefit from special 
education.
    There are certain kinds of services that might be provided by 
persons from varying professional backgrounds and with a variety of 
operational titles, depending upon requirements in individual States. 
For example, counseling services might be provided by social workers,

Sec. 300.17  Special education.

    (a)(1) As used in this part, the term ``special education'' means 
specially designed instruction, at no cost to the parents, to meet the 
unique needs of a child with a disability, including--
    (i) Instruction conducted in the classroom, in the home, in 
hospitals and institutions, and in other settings; and
    (ii) Instruction in physical education.
    (2) The term includes speech pathology, or any other related 
service, if the service consists of specially designed instruction, at 
no cost to the parents, to meet the unique needs of a child with a 
disability, and is considered special education rather than a related 
service under State standards.
    (3) The term also includes vocational education if it consists of 
specially designed instruction, at no cost to the parents, to meet the 
unique needs of a child with a disability.
    (b) The terms in this definition are defined as follows:
    (1) ``At no cost'' means that all specially designed instruction is 
provided without charge, but does not preclude incidental fees that are 
normally charged to nondisabled students or their parents as a part of 
the regular education program.
    (2) ``Physical education'' is defined as follows:
    (i) The term means the development of--
    (A) Physical and motor fitness;
    (B) Fundamental motor skills and patterns; and
    (C) Skills in aquatics, dance, and individual and group games and 
sports (including intramural and lifetime sports).
    (ii) The term includes special physical education, adaptive physical 
education, movement education, and motor development.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1401(a)(16))

    (3) Vocational education means organized educational programs that 
are directly related to the preparation of individuals for paid or 
unpaid employment, or for additional preparation for a career requiring 
other than a baccalaureate or advanced degree.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1401(16))


    Note 1: The definition of special education is a particularly 
important one under these regulations, since a child does not have a 
disability under this part unless he or she needs special education. 
(See the definition of children with disabilities in Sec. 300.7.) The 
definition of related services (Sec. 300.16) also depends on this 
definition, since a related service must be necessary for a child to 
benefit from special education. Therefore, if a child does not need 
special education, there can be no related services, and the child is 
not a child

[[Page 19]]

with a disability and is therefore not covered under the Act.


    Note 2: The above definition of vocational education is taken from 
the Vocational Education Act of 1963, as amended by Public Law 94-482. 
Under that Act, ``vocational education'' includes industrial arts and 
consumer and homemaking education programs.

adult education, adult services, independent living, or community 
participation.
    (b) The coordinated set of activities described in paragraph (a) of

    (i) Instruction;
    (ii) Community experiences;
    (iii) The development of employment and other post-school adult 
living objectives; and
    (iv) If appropriate, acquisition of daily living skills and 
functional vocational evaluation.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1401(a)(19))


    Note: Transition services for students with disabilities may be 
special education, if they are provided as specially designed 
instruction, or related services, if they are required to assist a 
student with a disability to benefit from special education. The list of 
activities in paragraph (b) is not intended to be exhaustive.

undertaken, to ensure that--
    (1) All children with disabilities, regardless of the severity of 
their disability, and who are in need of special education and related

    Note 1: The State is responsible for ensuring that all children with 
disabilities are identified, located, and evaluated, including children 
in all public and private agencies and institutions in the State. 
Collection and use of data are subject to the confidentiality 
requirements of Secs. 300.560-300.576.


    Note 2: Under both Parts B and H of the Act, States are responsible 
for identifying, locating, and evaluating infants and toddlers from 
birth through 2 years of age who have disabilities or who are suspected 
of having disabilities. In States where the SEA and the State's lead 
agency for the Part H program are different and the Part H lead agency 
will be participating in the child find activities described in 
paragraph (a) of this section, the nature and extent of the Part H lead 
agency's participation must, under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, be 
included in the State plan. With the SEA's agreement, the Part H lead 
agency's participation may include the actual implementation of child 
find activities for infants and toddlers. The use of an interagency 
agreement or other mechanism for providing for the Part H lead agency's 
participation would not alter or diminish the responsibility of the SEA 
to ensure compliance with all child find requirements, including the 
requirement in paragraph (a)(1) of this section that all children with 
disabilities who are in need of special education and related services 
are evaluated.

Sec. 300.620:
    (1) A list of administrative positions, and a description of duties

Sec. 300.150  State-level nonsupplanting.

    Each State plan must provide assurance satisfactory to the Secretary 
that funds provided under this part will be

[[Page 25]]

used so as to supplement and increase the level of Federal (other than 
funds available under this part), State, and local funds--including 
funds that are not under the direct control of the SEA or LEAs -- 
expended for special education and related services provided to children 
with disabilities under this part and in no case to supplant those 
Federal (other than funds available under this part), State, and local 
funds unless a waiver is granted in accordance with Sec. 300.589.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1413(a)(9))


    Note: This requirement is distinct from the LEA nonsupplanting 
provision already contained in these regulations at Sec. 300.230. Under 
this State-level provision, the State must assure that part B funds 
distributed to LEAs and IEUs will be used to supplement and not supplant 
other Federal, State, and local funds (including funds not under the 
control of educational agencies) that would have been expended for 
special education and related services provided to children with 
disabilities in the absence of the part B funds. The portion of part B 
funds that are not distributed to LEAs or IEUs under the statutory 
formula (20 U.S.C. 1411(d)) are not subject to this nonsupplanting 
provision. See 20 U.S.C. 1411(c)(3). States may not permit LEAs or IEUs 
to use part B funds to satisfy a financial commitment for services that 
would have been paid for by a health or other agency pursuant to policy 
or practice but for the fact that these services are now included in the 
IEPs of children with disabilities.

    (1) Describe the role that each of those agencies plays in providing 
or paying for services required under this part for children with 
disabilities; and
    (2) Provide for the development and implementation of interagency 
agreements that--
    (i) Define the financial responsibility of each agency for providing 
children with disabilities with FAPE;
    (ii) Establish procedures for resolving interagency disputes among 
agencies that are parties to the agreements; and
    (iii) Establish procedures under which LEAs may initiate proceedings 
in order to secure reimbursement from agencies that are parties to the 
agreements or otherwise implement the provisions of the agreements.

Sec. 300.153  Personnel standards.

    (a) As used in this part:
    (1) Appropriate professional requirements in the State means entry 
level requirements that--
    (i) Are based on the highest requirements in the State applicable to 
the profession or discipline in which a person is providing special 
education or related services; and
    (ii) Establish suitable qualifications for personnel providing 
special education and related services under this part to children and 
youth with disabilities who are served by State, local, and private 
agencies (see Sec. 300.2).
    (2) Highest requirements in the State applicable to a specific 
profession or discipline means the highest entry-level academic degree 
needed for any State approved or recognized certification, licensing, 
registration, or other comparable requirements that apply to that 
profession or discipline.
    (3) Profession or discipline means a specific occupational category 
that--
    (i) Provides special education and related services to children with 
disabilities under this part;

[[Page 26]]

    (ii) Has been established or designated by the State; and
    (iii) Has a required scope of responsibility and degree of 
supervision.
    (4) State approved or recognized certification, licensing, 
registration, or other comparable requirements means the requirements 
that a State legislature either has enacted or has authorized a State 
agency to promulgate through rules to establish the entry-level 
standards for employment in a specific profession or discipline in that 
State.
    (b)(1) Each State plan must include policies and procedures relating 
to the establishment and maintenance of standards to ensure that 
personnel necessary to carry out the purposes of this part are 
appropriately and adequately prepared and trained.
    (2) The policies and procedures required in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section must provide for the establishment and maintenance of standards 
that are consistent with any State approved or recognized certification, 
licensing, registration, or other comparable requirements that apply to 
the profession or discipline in which a person is providing special 
education or related services.
    (c) To the extent that a State's standards for a profession or 
discipline, including standards for temporary or emergency 
certification, are not based on the highest requirements in the State 
applicable to a specific profession or discipline, the State plan must 
include the steps the State is taking and the procedures for notifying 
public agencies and personnel of those steps and the timelines it has 
established for the retraining or hiring of personnel to meet 
appropriate professional requirements in the State.
    (d)(1) In meeting the requirements in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this 
section, a determination must be made about the status of personnel 
standards in the State. That determination must be based on current 
information that accurately describes, for each profession or discipline 
in which personnel are providing special education or related services, 
whether the applicable standards are consistent with the highest 
requirements in the State for that profession or discipline.
    (2) The information required in paragraph (d)(1) of this section 
must be on file in the SEA, and available to the public.
    (e) In identifying the highest requirements in the State for 
purposes of this section, the requirements of all State statutes and the 
rules of all State agencies applicable to serving children and youth 
with disabilities must be considered.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1413(a)(14))


    Note: The regulations require that the State use its own existing 
highest requirements to determine the standards appropriate to personnel 
who provide special education and related services under this part. The 
regulations do not require States to set any specified training 
standard, such as a master's degree, for employment of personnel who 
provide services under this part. In some instances, States will be 
required to show that they are taking steps to retrain or to hire 
personnel to meet the standards adopted by the SEA that are based on 
requirements for practice in a specific profession or discipline that 
were established by other State agencies. States in this position need 
not, however, require personnel providing services under this part to 
apply for and obtain the license, registration, or other comparable 
credential required by other agencies of individuals in that profession 
or discipline. The regulations permit each State to determine the 
specific occupational categories required to provide special education 
and related services and to revise or expand these categories as needed. 
The professions or disciplines defined by the State need not be limited 
to traditional occupational categories.

Sec. 300.182  The excess cost requirement.

    An LEA may only use funds under part B of the Act for the excess 
costs of providing special education and related services for children 
with disabilities.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1414(a)(1), (a)(2)(B)(i))


<R05>
Sec. 300.183  Meeting the excess cost requirement.

    (a) An LEA meets the excess cost requirement if it has on the 
average spent at least the amount determined under Sec. 300.184 for the 
education of each of its children with disabilities. This amount may not 
include capital outlay or debt service.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1402(20); 1414(a)(1))


    Note: The excess cost requirement means that the LEA must spend a 
certain minimum amount for the education of its children with 
disabilities before part B funds are used. This ensures that children 
served with part B funds have at least the same average amount spent on 
them, from sources other than part B, as do the children in the school 
district taken as a whole.
    The minimum amount that must be spent for the education of children 
with disabilities is computed under a statutory formula. Section 300.184 
implements this formula and gives a step-by-step method to determine the 
minimum amount. Excess costs are those costs of special education and 
related services that exceed the minimum amount. Therefore, if an LEA 
can show that it has (on the average) spent the minimum amount for the 
education of each of its children with disabilities, it has met the 
excess cost requirement, and all additional costs are excess costs. Part 
B funds can then be used to pay for these additional costs, subject to 
the other requirements of part B (priorities, etc.). In the Note under 
Sec. 300.184, there is an example of how the minimum amount is computed.


<R05>
Sec. 300.184  Excess costs--computation of minimum amount.

    The minimum average amount that an LEA must spend under Sec. 300.183 
for the education of each of its children with disabilities is computed 
as follows:
    (a) Add all expenditures of the LEA in the preceding school year, 
except capital outlay and debt service--
    (1) For elementary school students, if the child with a disability 
is an elementary school student; or
    (2) For secondary school students, if the child with a disability is 
a secondary school student.
    (b) From this amount, subtract the total of the following amounts 
spent for elementary school students or for secondary school students, 
as the case may be--
    (1) Amounts the agency spent in the preceding school year from funds 
awarded under part B of the Act and titles I and VII of the Elementary 
and Secondary Education Act of 1965; and
    (2) Amounts from State and local funds that the agency spent in the 
preceding school year for--
    (i) Programs for children with disabilities;
    (ii) Programs to meet the special educational needs of educationally 
deprived children; and
    (iii) Programs of bilingual education for limited English proficient 
children.
    (c) Divide the result under paragraph (b) of this section by the 
average number of students enrolled in the agency in the preceding 
school year--
    (1) In its elementary schools, if the child with a disability is an 
elementary school student; or
    (2) In its secondary schools, if the child with a disability is a 
secondary school student.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1414(a)(1))


    Note: The following is an example of how an LEA might compute the 
average minimum amount it must spend for the education of each of its 
children with disabilities, under Sec. 300.183. This example follows the 
formula in Sec. 300.184. Under the statute

[[Page 28]]

and regulations, the LEA must make one computation for children with 
disabilities in its elementary schools and a separate computation for 
children with disabilities in its secondary schools. The computation for 
elementary school students with disabilities would be done as follows:
    a. First, the LEA must determine its total amount of expenditures 
for elementary school students from all sources--local, State, and 
Federal (including part B)--in the preceding school year. Only capital 
outlay and debt service are excluded.

    Example: An LEA spent the following amounts last year for elementary 
school students (including its elementary school students with 
disabilities):

(1) From local tax funds.............................         $2,750,000
(2) From State funds.................................          7,000,000
(3) From Federal funds...............................            750,000
                                                      ------------------
                                                             10,500,000
  Of this total, $500,000 was for capital outlay and debt service
 relating to the education of elementary school students. This must be
 subtracted from total expenditures:
                                                             $10,500,000
                                                                -500,000
                                                      ------------------
  Total expenditures for elementary school students
   (less capital outlay and debt service)............         10,000,000

    b. Next, the LEA must subtract amounts spent for:
    (1) Programs for children with disabilities;
    (2) Programs to meet the special educational needs of educationally 
deprived children; and
    (3) Programs of bilingual education for limited English proficient 
children.
    These are funds that the LEA actually spent, not funds received last 
year but carried over for the current school year.
    Example: The LEA spent the following amounts for elementary school 
students last year:

(1) From funds under chapter 1 of title I of the Elementary
 and Secondary Education Act of 1965.......................      300,000
(2) From a special State program for educationally deprived
 children..................................................      200,000
(3) From a grant under part B..............................      200,000
(4) From State funds for the education of children with
 disabilities..............................................      500,000
(5) From a locally-funded program for children with
 disabilities..............................................      250,000
(6) From a grant for a bilingual education program under
 title VII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of
 1965......................................................      150,000
                                                            ------------
    Total..................................................    1,600,000

    (An LEA would also include any other funds it spent from Federal, 
State, or local sources for the three basic purposes: Children with 
disabilities, educationally deprived children, and bilingual education 
for limited English proficient children.)
    This amount is subtracted from the LEA's total expenditure for 
elementary school students computed above:

                                                             $10,000,000
                                                              -1,600,000
                                                           -------------
                                                               8,400,000

    c. The LEA next must divide by the average number of students 
enrolled in the elementary schools of the agency last year (including 
its students with disabilities).
    Example: Last year, an average of 7,000 students were enrolled in 
the agency's elementary schools. This must be divided into the amount 
computed under the above paragraph: $8,400,000/7,000 students = $1,200/
student.
    This figure is in the minimum amount the LEA must spend (on the 
average) for the education of each of its students with disabilities. 
Funds under part B may be used only for costs over and above this 
minimum. In this example, if the LEA has 100 elementary school students 
with disabilities, it must keep records adequate to show that it has 
spent at least $120,000 for the education of those students (100 
students times $1,200/student), not including capital outlay and debt 
service.
    This $120,000 may come from any funds except funds under part B, 
subject to any legal requirements that govern the use of those other 
funds.
    If the LEA has secondary school students with disabilities, it must 
do the same computation for them. However the amounts used in the 
computation would be those the LEA spent last year for the education of 
secondary school students, rather than for elementary school students.


<R05>
Sec. 300.185  Computation of excess costs--consolidated application.

    The minimum average amount under Sec. 300.183, if two or more LEAs 
submit a consolidated application, is the average of the combined 
minimum average amounts determined under Sec. 300.184 in those agencies 
for elementary or secondary school students, as the case may be.

Sec. 300.186  Excess costs--limitation on use of part B funds.

    (a) The excess cost requirement prevents an LEA from using funds 
provided under part B of the Act to pay for all of the costs directly 
attributable to the education of a child with a disability, subject to 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) The excess cost requirement does not prevent an LEA from using 
part B funds to pay for all of the costs directly attributable to the 
education of a child with a disability in any of the age ranges three, 
four, five, eighteen, nineteen, twenty, or twenty-one, if no local or 
State funds are available for nondisabled children in that age range. 
However, the LEA must comply with the nonsupplanting and other 
requirements of this part in providing the education and services.

its children with disabilities in any disability category in any of 
these age groups, it must make FAPE available to all its children with 
disabilities of the same age who have that disability. This provision 
does not apply to children aged 3 through 5 for any fiscal year for 
which the State receives a grant under section 619(a)(1) of the Act.
    (4) If a public agency provides education to a child with a 
disability in any of these age groups, it must make FAPE available to 
that child and provide that child and his or her parents all of the 
rights under part B of the Act and this part.
    (5) A State is not required to make FAPE available to a child with a 
disability in one of these age groups if--
    (i) State law expressly prohibits, or does not authorize, the 
expenditure of public funds to provide education to nondisabled children 
in that age group; or
    (ii) The requirement is inconsistent with a court order that governs 
the provision of free public education to children with disabilities in 
that State.
    (c) Children aged 3 through 21 on reservations. With the exception 
of children identified in Sec. 300.709(a)(1) and (2), the SEA shall be 
responsible for ensuring that all of the requirements of part B of the 
Act are implemented for all children aged 3 through 21 on reservations.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1411(f); 1412(2)(B); S. Rep. No. 94-168, p. 19 
(1975))


    Note 1: The requirement to make FAPE available applies to all 
children with disabilities within the State who are in the age ranges 
required under Sec. 300.300 and who need special education and related 
services. This includes children with disabilities already in school and 
children with less severe disabilities, who are not covered under the 
priorities under Sec. 300.321.



[[Page 35]]


    Note 2: In order to be in compliance with Sec. 300.300, each State 
must ensure that the requirement to identify, locate, and evaluate all 
children with disabilities is fully implemented by public agencies 
throughout the State. This means that before September 1, 1978, every 
child who has been referred or is on a waiting list for evaluation 
(including children in school as well as those not receiving an 
education) must be evaluated in accordance with Secs. 300.530-300.533. 
If, as a result of the evaluation, it is determined that a child needs 
special education and related services, an IEP must be developed for the 
child by September 1, 1978, and all other applicable requirements of 
this part must be met.


    Note 3: The requirement to identify, locate, and evaluate children 
with disabilities (commonly referred to as the ``child find system'') 
was enacted on August 21, 1974, under Pub. L. 93-380. While each State 
needed time to establish and implement its child find system, the four 
year period between August 21, 1974, and September 1, 1978, is 
considered to be sufficient to ensure that the system is fully 
operational and effective on a State-wide basis.
    Under the statute, the age range for the child find requirement (0-
21) is greater than the mandated age range for providing FAPE. One 
reason for the broader age requirement under ``child find'' is to enable 
States to be aware of and plan for younger children who will require 
special education and related services. It also ties in with the full 
educational opportunity goal requirement that has the same age range as 
child find. Moreover, while a State is not required to provide FAPE to 
children with disabilities below the age ranges mandated under 
Sec. 300.300, the State may, at its discretion, extend services to those 
children, subject to the priority requirements of Secs. 300.320-300.324.


<R05>
Sec. 300.301  Free appropriate public education--methods and payments.

    (a) Each State may use whatever State, local, Federal, and private 
sources of support are available in the State to meet the requirements 
of this part. For example, when it is necessary to place a child with a 
disability in a residential facility, a State could use joint agreements 
between the agencies involved for sharing the cost of that placement.
    (b) Nothing in this part relieves an insurer or similar third party 
from an otherwise valid obligation to provide or to pay for services 
provided to a child with a disability.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1401 (18); 1412(2)(B))


<R05>
Sec. 300.302  Residential placement.

    If placement in a public or private residential program is necessary 
to provide special education and related services to a child with a 
disability, the program, including non-medical care and room and board, 
must be at no cost to the parents of the child.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1412(2)(B); 1413(a)(4)(B))


    Note: This requirement applies to placements that are made by public 
agencies for educational purposes, and includes placements in State-
operated schools for children with disabilities, such as a State school 
for students with deafness or students with blindness.


<R05>
Sec. 300.303  Proper functioning of hearing aids.

    Each public agency shall ensure that the hearing aids worn by 
children with hearing impairments including deafness in school are 
functioning properly.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1412(2)(B))


    Note: The report of the House of Representatives on the 1978 
appropriation bill includes the following statement regarding hearing 
aids:
    In its report on the 1976 appropriation bill the Committee expressed 
concern about the condition of hearing aids worn by children in public 
schools. A study done at the Committee's direction by the Bureau of 
Education for the Handicapped reveals that up to one-third of the 
hearing aids are malfunctioning. Obviously, the Committee expects the 
Office of Education will ensure that hearing impaired school children 
are receiving adequate professional assessment, follow-up and services.

<R05>
Sec. 300.304  Full educational opportunity goal.

    (a) Each SEA shall ensure that each public agency establishes and 
implements a goal of providing full educational opportunity to all 
children with disabilities in the area served by the public agency.
    (b) Subject to the priority requirements of Secs. 300.320-300.324, 
an SEA or LEA may use part B funds to provide facilities, personnel, and 
services necessary to meet the full educational opportunity goal.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1412(2)(A); 1414(a)(1)(C))


    Note: In meeting the full educational opportunity goal, the Congress 
also encouraged

[[Page 36]]

LEAs to include artistic and cultural activities in programs supported 
under this part, subject to the priority requirements of Secs. 300.320-
300.324. This point is addressed in the following statements from the 
Senate Report on Public Law 94-142:
    The use of the arts as a teaching tool for the handicapped has long 
been recognized as a viable, effective way not only of teaching special 
skills, but also of reaching youngsters who had otherwise been 
unteachable. The Committee envisions that programs under this bill could 
well include an arts component and, indeed, urges that local educational 
agencies include the arts in programs for the handicapped funded under 
this Act. Such a program could cover both appreciation of the arts by 
the handicapped youngsters, and the utilization of the arts as a 
teaching tool per se.
    Museum settings have often been another effective tool in the 
teaching of handicapped children. For example, the Brooklyn Museum has 
been a leader in developing exhibits utilizing the heightened tactile 
sensory skill of the blind. Therefore, in light of the national policy 
concerning the use of museums in federally supported education programs 
enunciated in the Education Amendments of 1974, the Committee also urges 
local educational agencies to include museums in programs for the 
handicapped funded under this Act.

<R05>
Sec. 300.305  Program options.

    Each public agency shall take steps to ensure that its children with 
disabilities have available to them the variety of educational programs 
and services available to nondisabled children in the area served by the 
agency, including art, music, industrial arts, consumer and homemaking 
education, and vocational education.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1412(2)(A); 1414(a)(1)(C))


    Note: The above list of program options is not exhaustive, and could 
include any program or activity in which nondisabled students 
participate.


<R05>
Sec. 300.306  Nonacademic services.

    (a) Each public agency shall take steps to provide nonacademic and 
extracurricular services and activities in such manner as is necessary 
to afford children with disabilities an equal opportunity for 
participation in those services and activities.
    (b) Nonacademic and extracurricular services and activities may 
include counseling services, athletics, transportation, health services, 
recreational activities, special interest groups or clubs sponsored by 
the public agency, referrals to agencies that provide assistance to 
individuals with disabilities, and employment of students, including 
both employment by the public agency and assistance in making outside 
employment available.

Sec. 300.307  Physical education.

    (a) General. Physical education services, specially designed if 
necessary, must be made available to every child with a disability 
receiving FAPE.
    (b) Regular physical education. Each child with a disability must be 
afforded the opportunity to participate in the regular physical 
education program available to nondisabled children unless--
    (1) The child is enrolled full time in a separate facility; or
    (2) The child needs specially designed physical education, as 
prescribed in the child's IEP.
    (c) Special physical education. If specially designed physical 
education is prescribed in a child's IEP, the public agency responsible 
for the education of that child shall provide the services directly, or 
make arrangements for those services to be provided through other public 
or private programs.
    (d) Education in separate facilities. The public agency responsible 
for the education of a child with a disability who is enrolled in a 
separate facility shall ensure that the child receives appropriate 
physical education services in compliance with paragraphs (a) and (c) of 
this section.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1401(a)(16); 1412(5)(B); 1414(a)(6))


    Note: The Report of the House of Representatives on Public Law 94-
142 includes the following statement regarding physical education:
    Special education as set forth in the Committee bill includes 
instruction in physical education, which is provided as a matter of 
course to all non-handicapped children enrolled in public elementary and 
secondary schools. The Committee is concerned that although these 
services are available to and required of all children in our school 
systems,

[[Page 37]]

they are often viewed as a luxury for handicapped children.

                                * * * * *

    The Committee expects the Commissioner of Education to take whatever 
action is necessary to assure that physical education services are 
available to all handicapped children, and has specifically included 
physical education within the definition of special education to make 
clear that the Committee expects such services, specially designed where 
necessary, to be provided as an integral part of the educational program 
of every handicapped child.

Sec. 300.308  Assistive technology.

    Each public agency shall ensure that assistive technology devices or 
assistive technology services, or both, as those terms are defined in 
Secs. 300.5-300.6, are made available to a child with a disability if 
required as a part of the child's--
    (a) Special education under Sec. 300.17;
    (b) Related services under Sec. 300.16; or
    (c) Supplementary aids and services under Sec. 300.550(b)(2).

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1412(2), (5)(B))

                  Priorities in the Use of Part B Funds


<R05>
Sec. 300.320  Definitions of ``first priority children'' and ``second priority children.''

    For the purposes of Secs. 300.321-300.324, the term:
    (a) First priority children means children with disabilities who--
    (1) Are in an age group for which the State must make FAPE available 
under Sec. 300.300; and
    (2) Are not receiving any education.
    (b) Second priority children means children with disabilities, 
within each disability category, with the most severe disabilities who 
are receiving an inadequate education.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1412(3))


    Note 1: After September 1, 1978, there should be no second priority 
children, since States must ensure, as a condition of receiving part B 
funds for fiscal year 1979, that all children with disabilities will 
have FAPE available by that date.


    Note 2: The term free appropriate public education, as defined in 
Sec. 300.8, means special education and related services that * * * 
``are provided in conformity with an IEP'' * * *.


New first priority children will continue to be found by the State after 
September 1, 1978 through on-going efforts to identify, locate, and 
evaluate all children with disabilities.


<R05>
Sec. 300.321  Priorities.

    (a) Each SEA and LEA shall use funds provided under part B of the 
Act in the following order of priorities:
    (1) To provide FAPE to first priority children, including the 
identification, location, and evaluation of first priority children.
    (2) To provide FAPE to second priority children, including the 
identification, location, and evaluation of second priority children.
    (3) To meet the other requirements of this part.
    (b) The requirements of paragraph (a) of this section do not apply 
to funds that the State uses for administration under Sec. 300.620.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1411 (b)(1)(B), (b)(2)(B), (c)(1)(B), 
(c)(2)(A)(ii))


    Note: SEAs as well as LEAs must use part B funds (except the portion 
used for State administration) for the priorities. A State may have to 
set aside a portion of its part B allotment to be able to serve newly 
identified first priority children.
    After September 1, 1978, part B funds may be used--
    (1) To continue supporting child identification, location, and 
evaluation activities;
    (2) To provide FAPE to newly identified first priority children;
    (3) To meet the full educational opportunity goal required under 
Sec. 300.304, including employing additional personnel and providing 
inservice training, in order to increase the level, intensity and 
quality of services provided to individual children with disabilities; 
and
    (4) To meet the other requirements of part B.


<R05>
Sec. 300.322  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 300.323  Services to other children.

    If a State or an LEA is providing FAPE to all of its first priority 
children, that State or LEA may use funds provided under part B of the 
Act--

[[Page 38]]

    (a) To provide FAPE to children with disabilities who are not 
receiving any education and who are in the age groups not covered under 
Sec. 300.300 in that State; or
    (b) To provide FAPE to second priority children; or
    (c) Both.

<R05>
Sec. 300.324  Application of local educational agency to use funds for the second priority.

    An LEA may use funds provided under part B of the Act for second 
priority children, if it provides assurance satisfactory to the SEA in 
its application (or an amendment to its application)--
    (a) That all first priority children have FAPE available to them;
    (b) That the LEA has a system for the identification, location, and 
evaluation of children with disabilities, as described in its 
application; and
    (c) That whenever a first priority child is identified, located, and 
evaluated, the LEA makes FAPE available to the child.

                    Individualized Education Programs


<R05>
Sec. 300.340  Definitions.

    (a) As used in this part, the term individualized education program 
means a written statement for a child with a disability that is 
developed and implemented in accordance with Secs. 300.341-300.350.
    (b) As used in Secs. 300.346 and 300.347, participating agency means 
a State or local agency, other than the public agency responsible for a 
student's education, that is financially and legally responsible for 
providing transition services to the student.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1401(a)(20))


<R05>
Sec. 300.341  State educational agency responsibility.

    (a) Public agencies. The SEA shall ensure that each public agency 
develops and implements an IEP for each of its children with 
disabilities.
    (b) Private schools and facilities. The SEA shall ensure that an IEP 
is developed and implemented for each child with a disability who--
    (1) Is placed in or referred to a private school or facility by a 
public agency; or
    (2) Is enrolled in a parochial school or other private school and 
receives special education or related services from a public agency.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1412 (4), (6); 1413(a)(4))


    Note: This section applies to all public agencies, including other 
State agencies (e.g., departments of mental health and welfare) that 
provide special education to a child with a disability either directly, 
by contract or through other arrangements. Thus, if a State welfare 
agency contracts with a private school or facility to provide special 
education to a child with a disability, that agency would be responsible 
for ensuring that an IEP is developed for the child.

Sec. 300.342  When individualized education programs must be in effect.

    (a) At the beginning of each school year, each public agency shall 
have in effect an IEP for every child with a disability who is receiving 
special education from that agency.
    (b) An IEP must--
    (1) Be in effect before special education and related services are 
provided to a child; and
    (2) Be implemented as soon as possible following the meetings under 
Sec. 300.343.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1412(2)(B), (4), (6); 1414(a)(5); Pub. L. 94-142, 
sec. 8(c) (1975))


    Note: Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, it is expected that 
the IEP of a child with a disability will be implemented immediately 
following the meetings under Sec. 300.343. An exception to this would be 
(1) when the meetings occur during the summer or a vacation period, or 
(2) where there are circumstances that require a short delay (e.g., 
working out transportation arrangements). However, there can be no undue 
delay in providing special education and related services to the child.

<R05>
Sec. 300.343  Meetings.

    (a) General. Each public agency is responsible for initiating and 
conducting meetings for the purpose of developing, reviewing, and 
revising the IEP of a child with a disability (or, if consistent with 
State policy and at the discretion of the LEA, and with the concurrence 
of the parents, an individualized family service plan described in 
section 677(d) of the Act for each child with a disability, aged 3 
through 5).
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) Timeline. A meeting to develop an IEP for a child must be held 
within 30 calendar days of a determination that the child needs special 
education and related services.
    (d) Review. Each public agency shall initiate and conduct meetings 
to review each child's IEP periodically and, if appropriate, revise its 
provisions. A meeting must be held for this purpose at least once a 
year.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1412(2)(B), (4), (6); 1414(a)(5))


    Note: The date on which agencies must have IEPs in effect is 
specified in Sec. 300.342 (the beginning of each school year). However, 
except for new children with disabilities (i.e., those evaluated and 
determined to need special education and related services for the first 
time), the timing of meetings to develop, review, and revise IEPs is 
left to the discretion of each agency.
    In order to have IEPs in effect at the beginning of the school year, 
agencies could hold meetings either at the end of the preceding school 
year or during the summer prior to the next school year. Meetings may be 
held any time throughout the year, as long as IEPs are in effect at the 
beginning of each school year.
    The statute requires agencies to hold a meeting at least once each 
year in order to review and, if appropriate, revise each child's IEP. 
The timing of those meetings could be on the anniversary date of the 
child's last IEP meeting, but this is left to the discretion of the 
agency.

<R05>
Sec. 300.344  Participants in meetings.

    (a) General. The public agency shall ensure that each meeting 
includes the following participants:
    (1) A representative of the public agency, other than the child's 
teacher, who is qualified to provide, or supervise the provision of, 
special education.
    (2) The child's teacher.
    (3) One or both of the child's parents, subject to Sec. 300.345.
    (4) The child, if appropriate.
    (5) Other individuals at the discretion of the parent or agency.
    (b) Evaluation personnel. For a child with a disability who has been 
evaluated for the first time, the public agency shall ensure--
    (1) That a member of the evaluation team participates in the 
meeting; or
    (2) That the representative of the public agency, the child's 
teacher, or some other person is present at the meeting, who is 
knowledgeable about the evaluation procedures used with the child and is 
familiar with the results of the evaluation.
    (c) Transition services participants. (1) If a purpose of the 
meeting is the consideration of transition services for a student, the 
public agency shall invite--
    (i) The student; and
    (ii) A representative of any other agency that is likely to be 
responsible for providing or paying for transition services.
    (2) If the student does not attend, the public agency shall take 
other steps to ensure that the student's preferences and interests are 
considered; and
    (3) If an agency invited to send a representative to a meeting does 
not do so, the public agency shall take other steps to obtain the 
participation of the other agency in the planning of any transition 
services.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1401(a)(19), (a)(20); 1412(2)(B), (4), (6); 
1414(a)(5))


    Note 1: In deciding which teacher will participate in meetings on a 
child's IEP, the agency may wish to consider the following 
possibilities:
    (a) For a child with a disability who is receiving special 
education, the teacher could be the child's special education teacher. 
If the child's disability is a speech impairment, the teacher could be 
the speech-language pathologist.
    (b) For a child with a disability who is being considered for 
placement in special education, the teacher could be the child's regular 
teacher, or a teacher qualified to

[[Page 40]]

provide education in the type of program in which the child may be 
placed, or both.
    (c) If the child is not in school or has more than one teacher, the 
agency may designate which teacher will participate in the meeting.
    Either the teacher or the agency representative should be qualified 
in the area of the child's suspected disability.
    For a child whose primary disability is a speech or language 
impairment, the evaluation personnel participating under paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section would normally be the speech-language 
pathologist.


    Note 2: Under paragraph (c) of this section, the public agency is 
required to invite each student to participate in his or her IEP 
meeting, if a purpose of the meeting is the consideration of transition 
services for the student. For all students who are 16 years of age or 
older, one of the purposes of the annual meeting will always be the 
planning of transition services, since transition services are a 
required component of the IEP for these students.
    For a student younger than age 16, if transition services are 
initially discussed at a meeting that does not include the student, the 
public agency is responsible for ensuring that, before a decision about 
transition services for the student is made, a subsequent IEP meeting is 
conducted for that purpose, and the student is invited to the meeting.


<R05>
Sec. 300.345  Parent participation.

    (a) Each public agency shall take steps to ensure that one or both 
of the parents of the child with a disability are present at each 
meeting or are afforded the opportunity to participate, including--
    (1) Notifying parents of the meeting early enough to ensure that 
they will have an opportunity to attend; and
    (2) Scheduling the meeting at a mutually agreed on time and place.
    (b)(1) The notice under paragraph (a)(1) of this section must 
indicate the purpose, time, and location of the meeting and who will be 
in attendance;
    (2) If a purpose of the meeting is the consideration of transition 
services for a student, the notice must also--
    (i) Indicate this purpose;
    (ii) Indicate that the agency will invite the student; and
    (iii) Identify any other agency that will be invited to send a 
representative.
    (c) If neither parent can attend, the public agency shall use other 
methods to ensure parent participation, including individual or 
conference telephone calls.
    (d) A meeting may be conducted without a parent in attendance if the 
public agency is unable to convince the parents that they should attend. 
In this case the public agency must have a record of its attempts to 
arrange a mutually agreed on time and place such as--
    (1) Detailed records of telephone calls made or attempted and the 
results of those calls;
    (2) Copies of correspondence sent to the parents and any responses 
received; and
    (3) Detailed records of visits made to the parent's home or place of 
employment and the results of those visits.
    (e) The public agency shall take whatever action is necessary to 
ensure that the parent understands the proceedings at a meeting, 
including arranging for an interpreter for parents with deafness or 
whose native language is other than English.
    (f) The public agency shall give the parent, on request, a copy of 
the IEP.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1401(a)(20); 1412 (2)(B), (4), (6); 1414(a)(5))


    Note: The notice in paragraph (a) of this section could also inform 
parents that they may bring other people to the meeting. As indicated in 
paragraph (c) of this section, the procedure used to notify parents 
(whether oral or written or both) is left to the discretion of the 
agency, but the agency must keep a record of its efforts to contact 
parents.

    (a) General. The IEP for each child must include--
    (1) A statement of the child's present levels of educational 
performance;
    (2) A statement of annual goals, including short-term instructional 
objectives;
    (3) A statement of the specific special education and related 
services to be provided to the child and the extent that the child will 
be able to participate in regular educational programs;

[[Page 41]]

    (4) The projected dates for initiation of services and the 
anticipated duration of the services; and
    (5) Appropriate objective criteria and evaluation procedures and 
schedules for determining, on at least an annual basis, whether the 
short term instructional objectives are being achieved.
    (b) Transition services. (1) The IEP for each student, beginning no 
later than age 16 (and at a younger age, if determined appropriate), 
must include a statement of the needed transition services as defined in 
Sec. 300.18, including, if appropriate, a statement of each public 
agency's and each participating agency's responsibilities or linkages, 
or both, before the student leaves the school setting.
    (2) If the IEP team determines that services are not needed in one 
or more of the areas specified in Sec. 300.18 (b)(2)(i) through 
(b)(2)(iii), the IEP must include a statement to that effect and the 
basis upon which the determination was made.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1401 (a)(19), (a)(20); 1412 (2)(B), (4), (6); 
1414(a)(5))


    Note 1: The legislative history of the transition services 
provisions of the Act suggests that the statement of needed transition 
services referred to in paragraph (b) of this section should include a 
commitment by any participating agency to meet any financial 
responsibility it may have in the provision of transition services. See 
House Report No. 101-544, p. 11 (1990).


    Note 2: With respect to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this 
section, it is generally expected that the statement of needed 
transition services will include the areas listed in Sec. 300.18 
(b)(2)(i) through (b)(2)(iii). If the IEP team determines that services 
are not needed in one of those areas, the public agency must implement 
the requirements in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Since it is a part 
of the IEP, the IEP team must reconsider its determination at least 
annually.


    Note 3: Section 602(a)(20) of the Act provides that IEPs must 
include a statement of needed transition services for students beginning 
no later than age 16, but permits transition services to students below 
age 16 (i.e., ``* * * and, when determined appropriate for the 
individual, beginning at age 14 or younger.''). Although the statute 
does not mandate transition services for all students beginning at age 
14 or younger, the provision of these services could have a 
significantly positive effect on the employment and independent living 
outcomes for many of these students in the future, especially for 
students who are likely to drop out before age 16. With respect to the 
provision of transition services to students below age 16, the Report of 
the House Committee on Education and Labor on Public Law 101-476 
includes the following statement:
    Although this language leaves the final determination of when to 
initiate transition services for students under age 16 to the IEP 
process, it nevertheless makes clear that Congress expects consideration 
to be given to the need for transition services for some students by age 
14 or younger. The Committee encourages that approach because of their 
concern that age 16 may be too late for many students, particularly 
those at risk of dropping out of school and those with the most severe 
disabilities. Even for those students who stay in school until age 18, 
many will need more than two years of transitional services. Students 
with disabilities are now dropping out of school before age 16, feeling 
that the education system has little to offer them. Initiating services 
at a younger age will be critical. (House Report No. 101-544, 10 
(1990).)

Sec. 300.347  Agency responsibilities for transition services.

    (a) If a participating agency fails to provide agreed-upon 
transition services contained in the IEP of a student with a disability, 
the public agency responsible for the student's education shall, as soon 
as possible, initiate a meeting for the purpose of identifying 
alternative strategies to meet the transition objectives and, if 
necessary, revising the student's IEP.
    (b) Nothing in this part relieves any participating agency, 
including a State vocational rehabilitation agency, of the 
responsibility to provide or pay for any transition service that the 
agency would otherwise provide to students with disabilities who meet 
the eligibility criteria of that agency.

<R05>
Sec. 300.348  Private school placements by public agencies.

    (a) Developing individualized education programs. (1) Before a 
public agency places a child with a disability in, or

[[Page 42]]

refers a child to, a private school or facility, the agency shall 
initiate and conduct a meeting to develop an IEP for the child in 
accordance with Sec. 300.343.
    (2) The agency shall ensure that a representative of the private 
school or facility attends the meeting. If the representative cannot 
attend, the agency shall use other methods to ensure participation by 
the private school or facility, including individual or conference 
telephone calls.
    (3) [Reserved]
    (b) Reviewing and revising individualized education programs. (1) 
After a child with a disability enters a private school or facility, any 
meetings to review and revise the child's IEP may be initiated and 
conducted by the private school or facility at the discretion of the 
public agency.
    (2) If the private school or facility initiates and conducts these 
meetings, the public agency shall ensure that the parents and an agency 
representative:
    (i) Are involved in any decision about the child's IEP; and
    (ii) Agree to any proposed changes in the program before those 
changes are implemented.
    (c) Responsibility. Even if a private school or facility implements 
a child's IEP, responsibility for compliance with this part remains with 
the public agency and the SEA.

Sec. 300.349  Children with disabilities in parochial or other private schools.

    If a child with a disability is enrolled in a parochial or other 
private school and receives special education or related services from a 
public agency, the public agency shall--
    (a) Initiate and conduct meetings to develop, review, and revise an 
IEP for the child, in accordance with Sec. 300.343; and
    (b) Ensure that a representative of the parochial or other private 
school attends each meeting. If the representative cannot attend, the 
agency shall use other methods to ensure participation by the private 
school, including individual or conference telephone calls.

<R05>
Sec. 300.350  Individualized education program--accountability.

    Each public agency must provide special education and related 
services to a child with a disability in accordance with an IEP. 
However, part B of the Act does not require that any agency, teacher, or 
other person be held accountable if a child does not achieve the growth 
projected in the annual goals and objectives.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1412(2)(B); 1414(a) (5), (6); Cong. Rec. at H7152 
(daily ed., July 21, 1975))


    Note: This section is intended to relieve concerns that the IEP 
constitutes a guarantee by the public agency and the teacher that a 
child will progress at a specified rate. However, this section does not 
relieve agencies and teachers from making good faith efforts to assist 
the child in achieving the goals and objectives listed in the IEP. 
Further, the section does not limit a parent's right to complain and ask 
for revisions of the child's program, or to invoke due process 
procedures, if the parent feels that these efforts are not being made.

             Direct Service by the State Educational Agency


<R05>
Sec. 300.360  Use of local educational agency allocation for direct services.

    (a) An SEA may not distribute funds to an LEA, and shall use those 
funds to ensure the provision of FAPE to children with disabilities 
residing in the area served by the LEA, if the LEA, in any fiscal year--
    (1) Is entitled to less than $7,500 for that fiscal year (beginning 
with fiscal year 1979);
    (2) Does not submit an application that meets the requirements of 
Secs. 300.220-300.240;
    (3) Is unable or unwilling to establish and maintain programs of 
FAPE;
    (4) Is unable or unwilling to be consolidated with other LEAs in 
order to

[[Page 43]]

establish and maintain those programs; or
    (5) Has one or more children with disabilities who can best be 
served by a regional or State center designed to meet the needs of those 
children.
    (b) In meeting the requirements in paragraph (a) of this section, 
the SEA may provide special education and related services directly, by 
contract, or through other arrangements.
    (c) The excess cost requirements of Secs. 300.182-300.186 do not 
apply to the SEA.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1411(c)(4); 1413(b); 1414(d))


    Note: Section 300.360 is a combination of three provisions in the 
statute (Sections 611(c)(4), 613(b), and 614(d)). This section focuses 
mainly on the State's administration and use of local entitlements under 
part B.
    The SEA, as a recipient of part B funds, is responsible for ensuring 
that all public agencies in the State comply with the provisions of the 
Act, regardless of whether they receive part B funds. If an LEA elects 
not to apply for its part B entitlement, the State would be required to 
use those funds to ensure that FAPE is made available to children 
residing in the area served by that local agency. However, if the local 
entitlement is not sufficient for this purpose, additional State or 
local funds would have to be expended in order to ensure that FAPE and 
the other requirements of the Act are met.
    Moreover, if the LEA is the recipient of any other Federal funds, it 
would have to be in compliance with 34 CFR Secs. 104.31-104.39 of the 
regulations implementing section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. 
It should be noted that the term ``FAPE'' has different meanings under 
part B and section 504. For example, under part B, FAPE is a statutory 
term that requires special education and related services to be provided 
in accordance with an IEP. However, under section 504, each recipient 
must provide an education that includes services that are ``designed to 
meet individual educational needs of handicapped persons as adequately 
as the needs of nonhandicapped persons are met * * *'' Those regulations 
state that implementation of an IEP, in accordance with part B, is one 
means of meeting the FAPE requirement.


<R05>
Sec. 300.361  Nature and location of services.

    The SEA may provide special education and related services under 
Sec. 300.360(a) in the manner and at the location it considers 
appropriate. However, the manner in which the education and services are 
provided must be consistent with the requirements of this part 
(including the LRE provisions of Secs. 300.550-300.556).

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1414(d))


<R05>
Sec. 300.370  Use of State agency allocations.

    (a) The State may use the portion of its allocation that it does not 
use for administration under Secs. 300.620-300.621--
    (1) For support services and direct services in accordance with the 
priority requirements of Secs. 300.320-300.324; and
    (2) For the administrative costs of the State's monitoring 
activities and complaint investigations, to the extent that these costs 
exceed the administrative costs for monitoring and complaint 
investigations incurred during fiscal year 1985.
    (b) For the purposes of paragraph (a) of this section--
    (1) Direct services means services provided to a child with a 
disability by the State directly, by contract, or through other 
arrangements; and
    (2) ``Support services'' includes implementing the comprehensive 
system of personnel development of Secs. 300.380-300.383, recruitment 
and training of hearing officers and surrogate parents, and public 
information and parent training activities relating to FAPE for children 
with disabilities.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1411 (b)(2), (c)(2))


<R05>
Sec. 300.371  State matching.

    Beginning with the period July 1, 1978-June 30, 1979, and for each 
following fiscal year, the funds that a State uses for direct and 
support services under Sec. 300.370 must be matched on a program basis 
by the State from funds other than Federal funds. This requirement does 
not apply to funds that the State uses under Sec. 300.360.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1411 (c)(2)(B), (c)(4)(B))


    Note: The requirement in Sec. 300.371 would be satisfied if the 
State can document that the amount of State funds expended for each 
major program area (e.g., the comprehensive system of personnel 
development) is at least equal to the expenditure of Federal funds in 
that program area.


[[Page 44]]




<R05>
Sec. 300.372  Applicability of nonsupplanting requirement.

    Beginning with funds appropriated for fiscal year 1979 and for each 
following fiscal year, the requirement in section 613(a)(9) of the Act, 
which prohibits supplanting with Federal funds, does not apply to funds 
that the State uses from its allocation under Sec. 300.706(a) for 
administration, direct services, or support services.

              Comprehensive System of Personnel Development


<R05>
Sec. 300.380  General.

    Each State shall--
    (a) Develop and implement a comprehensive system of personnel 
development that--
    (1) Is consistent with the purposes of the Act and with the 
comprehensive system of personnel development described in 34 CFR 
Sec. 303.360;
    (2) Meets the requirements in Secs. 300.381-300.383; and
    (3) Is consistent with the provisions on personnel standards in 
Sec. 300.153; and
    (b) Include in its State plan a description of the personnel 
development system required in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

of private school children with disabilities in the program assisted or 
carried out under this part, as required by section 613(a)(4)(A) of the

pass.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1413(d)(1))


<R05>
Sec. 300.481  Provisions for services under a by-pass.

    (a) Before implementing a by-pass, the Secretary consults with 
appropriate public and private school officials, including SEA 
officials, in the affected State to consider matters such as--
    (1) The prohibition imposed by State law that results in the need 
for a by-pass;
    (2) The scope and nature of the services required by private school 
children with disabilities in the State, and the number of children to 
be served under the by-pass; and

[[Page 47]]

    (3) The establishment of policies and procedures to ensure that 
private school children with disabilities receive services consistent 
with the requirements of section 613(a)(4)(A) of the Act, Secs. 300.451-
300.452, and 34 CFR Secs. 76.651-76.662.

    (c) For any fiscal year that a by-pass is implemented, the Secretary 
determines the maximum amount to be paid to the providers of services by 
multiplying--
    (1) A per child amount that may not exceed the amount per child 
provided by the Secretary under this part for all children with 
disabilities in the State for the preceding fiscal year; by
    (2) The number of private school children with disabilities (as

the Secretary on the basis of the most recent satisfactory data 
available, which may include an estimate of the number of those children 
with disabilities.
    (d) The Secretary deducts from the State's allocation under this 
part the amount the Secretary determines is necessary to implement a by-
pass and pays that amount to the provider of services. The Secretary may 
withhold this amount from the State's allocation pending final 
resolution of any investigation or complaint that could result in a 
determination that a by-pass must be implemented.

                    Subpart E--Procedural Safeguards

             Due Process Procedures for Parents and Children


<R05>
Sec. 300.500  Definitions of ``consent,'' ``evaluation,'' and ``personally identifiable.''

    (a) As used in this part: Consent means that--
    (1) The parent has been fully informed of all information relevant 
to the activity for which consent is sought, in his or her native 
language, or other mode of communication;
    (2) The parent understands and agrees in writing to the carrying out 
of the activity for which his or her consent is sought, and the consent 
describes that activity and lists the records (if any) that will be 
released and to whom; and
    (3) The parent understands that the granting of consent is voluntary 
on the part of the parent and may be revoked at any time.
    (b) Evaluation means procedures used in accordance with 
Secs. 300.530-300.534 to determine whether a child has a disability and 
the nature and extent of

[[Page 49]]

the special education and related services that the child needs. The 
term means procedures used selectively with an individual child and does 
not include basic tests administered to or procedures used with all 
children in a school, grade, or class.
    (c) Personally identifiable means that information includes--
    (1) The name of the child, the child's parent, or other family 
member;
    (2) The address of the child;
    (3) A personal identifier, such as the child's social security 
number or student number; or
    (4) A list of personal characteristics or other information that 
would make it possible to identify the child with reasonable certainty.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1415, 1417(c))


<R05>
Sec. 300.501  General responsibility of public agencies.

    Each SEA shall ensure that each public agency establishes and 
implements procedural safeguards that meet the requirements of 
Secs. 300.500-300.515.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1415(a))


<R05>
Sec. 300.502  Opportunity to examine records.

    The parents of a child with a disability shall be afforded, in 
accordance with the procedures of Secs. 300.562-300.569, an opportunity 
to inspect and review all education records with respect to--
    (a) The identification, evaluation, and educational placement of the 
child; and
    (b) The provision of FAPE to the child.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1415(b)(1)(A))


<R05>
Sec. 300.503  Independent educational evaluation.

    (a) General. (1) The parents of a child with a disability have the 
right under this part to obtain an independent educational evaluation of 
the child, subject to paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section.
    (2) Each public agency shall provide to parents, on request, 
information about where an independent educational evaluation may be 
obtained.
    (3) For the purposes of this part:
    (i) Independent educational evaluation means an evaluation conducted 
by a qualified examiner who is not employed by the public agency 
responsible for the education of the child in question.
    (ii) Public expense means that the public agency either pays for the 
full cost of the evaluation or ensures that the evaluation is otherwise 
provided at no cost to the parent, consistent with Sec. 300.301.
    (b) Parent right to evaluation at public expense. A parent has the 
right to an independent educational evaluation at public expense if the 
parent disagrees with an evaluation obtained by the public agency. 
However, the public agency may initiate a hearing under Sec. 300.506 to 
show that its evaluation is appropriate. If the final decision is that 
the evaluation is appropriate, the parent still has the right to an 
independent educational evaluation, but not at public expense.
    (c) Parent initiated evaluations. If the parent obtains an 
independent educational evaluation at private expense, the results of 
the evaluation--
    (1) Must be considered by the public agency in any decision made 
with respect to the provision of FAPE to the child; and
    (2) May be presented as evidence at a hearing under this subpart 
regarding that child.
    (d) Requests for evaluations by hearing officers. If a hearing 
officer requests an independent educational evaluation as part of a 
hearing, the cost of the evaluation must be at public expense.
    (e) Agency criteria. Whenever an independent evaluation is at public 
expense, the criteria under which the evaluation is obtained, including 
the location of the evaluation and the qualifications of the examiner, 
must be the same as the criteria which the public agency uses when it 
initiates an evaluation.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1415(b)(1)(A))


<R05>
Sec. 300.504  Prior notice; parent consent.

    (a) Notice. Written notice that meets the requirements of 
Sec. 300.505 must be given to the parents of a child with a disability a 
reasonable time before the public agency--
    (1) Proposes to initiate or change the identification, evaluation, 
or educational placement of the child or the provision of FAPE to the 
child; or

[[Page 50]]

    (2) Refuses to initiate or change the identification, evaluation, or 
educational placement of the child or the provision of FAPE to the 
child.
    (b) Consent; procedures if a parent refuses consent. (1) Parental 
consent must be obtained before--
    (i) Conducting a preplacement evaluation; and
    (ii) Initial placement of a child with a disability in a program 
providing special education and related services.
    (2) If State law requires parental consent before a child with a 
disability is evaluated or initially provided special education and 
related services, State procedures govern the public agency in 
overriding a parent's refusal to consent.
    (3) If there is no State law requiring consent before a child with a 
disability is evaluated or initially provided special education and 
related services, the public agency may use the hearing procedures in 
Secs. 300.506-300.508 to determine if the child may be evaluated or 
initially provided special education and related services without 
parental consent. If it does so and the hearing officer upholds the 
agency, the agency may evaluate or initially provide special education 
and related services to the child without the parent's consent, subject 
to the parent's rights under Secs. 300.510-300.513.
    (c) Additional State consent requirements. In addition to the 
parental consent requirements described in paragraph (b) of this 
section, a State may require parental consent for other services and 
activities under this part if it ensures that each public agency in the 
State establishes and implements effective procedures to ensure that a 
parent's refusal to consent does not result in a failure to provide the 
child with FAPE.
    (d) Limitation. A public agency may not require parental consent as 
a condition of any benefit to the parent or the child except for the 
service or activity for which consent is required under paragraphs (b) 
or (c) of this section.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1415(b)(1)(C), (D); 1412(2), (6))


    Note 1: Any changes in a child's special education program after the 
initial placement are not subject to the parental consent requirements 
in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, but are subject to the prior notice 
requirement in paragraph (a) of this section and the IEP requirements of 
Secs. 300.340-300.350.


    Note 2: Paragraph (b)(2) of this section means that if State law 
requires parental consent before evaluation or before special education 
and related services are initially provided, and the parent refuses (or 
otherwise withholds) consent, State procedures, such as obtaining a 
court order authorizing the public agency to conduct the evaluation or 
provide the education and related services, must be followed.
    If, however, there is no legal requirement for consent outside of 
these regulations, the public agency may use the due process procedures 
of Secs. 300.506-300.508 to obtain a decision to allow the evaluation or 
services without parental consent. The agency must notify the parent of 
its actions, and the parent has appeal rights as well as rights at the 
hearing itself.


    Note 3: If a State adopts a consent requirement in addition to those 
described in paragraph (b) of this section and consent is refused, 
paragraph (d) of this section requires that the public agency must 
nevertheless provide the services and activities that are not in 
dispute. For example, if a State requires parental consent to the 
provision of all services identified in an IEP and the parent refuses to 
consent to physical therapy services included in the IEP, the agency is 
not relieved of its obligation to implement those portions of the IEP to 
which the parent consents.
    If the parent refuses to consent and the public agency determines 
that the service or activity in dispute is necessary to provide FAPE to 
the child, paragraph (c) of this section requires that the agency must 
implement its procedures to override the refusal. This section does not 
preclude the agency from reconsidering its proposal if it believes that 
circumstances warrant.


<R05>
Sec. 300.505  Content of notice.

    (a) The notice under Sec. 300.504 must include--
    (1) A full explanation of all of the procedural safeguards available 
to the parents under Sec. 300.500, Secs. 300.502-300.515, and 
Secs. 300.562-300.569;
    (2) A description of the action proposed or refused by the agency, 
an explanation of why the agency proposes or refuses to take the action, 
and a description of any options the agency considered and the reasons 
why those options were rejected;

[[Page 51]]

    (3) A description of each evaluation procedure, test, record, or 
report the agency uses as a basis for the proposal or refusal; and
    (4) A description of any other factors that are relevant to the 
agency's proposal or refusal.
    (b) The notice must be--
    (1) Written in language understandable to the general public; and
    (2) Provided in the native language of the parent or other mode of 
communication used by the parent, unless it is clearly not feasible to 
do so.
    (c) If the native language or other mode of communication of the 
parent is not a written language, the SEA or LEA shall take steps to 
ensure--
    (1) That the notice is translated orally or by other means to the 
parent in his or her native language or other mode of communication;
    (2) That the parent understands the content of the notice; and
    (3) That there is written evidence that the requirements in 
paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section have been met.

<R05>
Sec. 300.506  Impartial due process hearing.

    (a) A parent or a public educational agency may initiate a hearing 
on any of the matters described in Sec. 300.504(a)(1) and (2).
    (b) The hearing must be conducted by the SEA or the public agency 
directly responsible for the education of the child, as determined under 
State statute, State regulation, or a written policy of the SEA.
    (c) The public agency shall inform the parent of any free or low-
cost legal and other relevant services available in the area if--
    (1) The parent requests the information; or
    (2) The parent or the agency initiates a hearing under this section.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1415(b)(2))


    Note: Many States have pointed to the success of using mediation as 
an intervening step prior to conducting a formal due process hearing. 
Although the process of mediation is not required by the statute or 
these regulations, an agency may wish to suggest mediation in disputes 
concerning the identification, evaluation, and educational placement of 
children with disabilities, and the provision of FAPE to those children. 
Mediations have been conducted by members of SEAs or LEA personnel who 
were not previously involved in the particular case. In many cases, 
mediation leads to resolution of differences between parents and 
agencies without the development of an adversarial relationship and with 
minimal emotional stress. However, mediation may not be used to deny or 
delay a parent's rights under Secs. 300.500-300.515.


<R05>
Sec. 300.507  Impartial hearing officer.

    (a) A hearing may not be conducted--
    (1) By a person who is an employee of a public agency that is 
involved in the education or care of the child; or
    (2) By any person having a personal or professional interest that 
would conflict with his or her objectivity in the hearing.
    (b) A person who otherwise qualifies to conduct a hearing under 
paragraph (a) of this section is not an employee of the agency solely 
because he or she is paid by the agency to serve as a hearing officer.
    (c) Each public agency shall keep a list of the persons who serve as 
hearing officers. The list must include a statement of the 
qualifications of each of those persons.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1414(b)(2))


<R05>
Sec. 300.508  Hearing rights.

    (a) Any party to a hearing has the right to:
    (1) Be accompanied and advised by counsel and by individuals with 
special knowledge or training with respect to the problems of children 
with disabilities.
    (2) Present evidence and confront, cross-examine, and compel the 
attendance of witnesses.
    (3) Prohibit the introduction of any evidence at the hearing that 
has not been disclosed to that party at least five days before the 
hearing.
    (4) Obtain a written or electronic verbatim record of the hearing.
    (5) Obtain written findings of fact and decisions. The public 
agency, after

[[Page 52]]

panel established under Sec. 300.650; and
    (ii) Make those findings and decisions available to the public.
    (b) Parents involved in hearings must be given the right to--
    (1) Have the child who is the subject of the hearing present; and
    (2) Open the hearing to the public.

Sec. 300.510  Administrative appeal; impartial review.

    (a) If the hearing is conducted by a public agency other than the 
SEA, any party aggrieved by the findings and decision in the hearing may 
appeal to the SEA.
    (b) If there is an appeal, the SEA shall conduct an impartial review 
of the hearing. The official conducting the review shall:
    (1) Examine the entire hearing record.
    (2) Ensure that the procedures at the hearing were consistent with 
the requirements of due process.
    (3) Seek additional evidence if necessary. If a hearing is held to 
receive additional evidence, the rights in 300.508 apply.
    (4) Afford the parties an opportunity for oral or written argument, 
or both, at the discretion of the reviewing official.
    (5) Make an independent decision on completion of the review.
    (6) Give a copy of written findings and the decision to the parties.
    (c) The SEA, after deleting any personally identifiable information,

another State agency acting on its behalf. However, the SEA remains 
responsible for the final decision on review.


    Note 2: All parties have the right to continue to be represented by 
counsel at the State administrative review level, whether or not the 
reviewing official determines that a further hearing is necessary. If 
the reviewing official decides to hold a hearing to receive additional

Sec. 300.513  Child's status during proceedings.

    (a) During the pendency of any administrative or judicial proceeding 
regarding a complaint, unless the public agency and the parents of the 
child agree otherwise, the child involved in the complaint must remain 
in his or her present educational placement.
    (b) If the complaint involves an application for initial admission 
to public school, the child, with the consent of the parents, must be 
placed in the public school program until the completion of all the 
proceedings.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1415(e)(3))


    Note: Section 300.513 does not permit a child's placement to be 
changed during a complaint proceeding, unless the parents and agency 
agree otherwise. While the placement may not be changed, this does not 
preclude the agency from using its normal procedures for dealing with 
children who are endangering themselves or others.

    (2) The public agency, after reasonable efforts, cannot discover the 
whereabouts of a parent; or
    (3) The child is a ward of the State under the laws of that State.
    (b) Duty of public agency. The duty of a public agency under 
paragraph (a) of this section includes the assignment of an individual 
to act as a surrogate for the parents. This must include a method: (1) 
For determining whether a child needs a surrogate parent, and (2) for 
assigning a surrogate parent to the child.
    (c) Criteria for selection of surrogates. (1) The public agency may 
select a surrogate parent in any way permitted under State law.
    (2) Public agencies shall ensure that a person selected as a 
surrogate--
    (i) Has no interest that conflicts with the interest of the child he 
or she represents; and
    (ii) Has knowledge and skills that ensure adequate representation of 
the child.
    (d) Non-employee requirement; compensation. (1) A person assigned as 
a surrogate may not be an employee of a public agency that is involved 
in the education or care of the child.
    (2) A person who otherwise qualifies to be a surrogate parent under 
paragraphs (c) and (d)(1) of this section, is not an employee of the 
agency solely because he or she is paid by the agency to serve as a 
surrogate parent.
    (e) Responsibilities. The surrogate parent may represent the child 
in all matters relating to--
    (1) The identification, evaluation, and educational placement of the 
child; and
    (2) The provision of FAPE to the child.

Sec. 300.530  General.

    (a) Each SEA shall ensure that each public agency establishes and 
implements procedures that meet the requirements of Secs. 300.530-
300.534.
    (b) Testing and evaluation materials and procedures used for the 
purposes of evaluation and placement of children with disabilities must 
be selected and administered so as not to be racially or culturally 
discriminatory.

<R05>
Sec. 300.531  Preplacement evaluation.

    Before any action is taken with respect to the initial placement of 
a child with a disability in a program providing special education and 
related services, a full and individual evaluation of the child's 
educational needs must be conducted in accordance with the requirements 
of Sec. 300.532.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1412(5)(C))


<R05>
Sec. 300.532  Evaluation procedures.

    State educational agencies and LEAs shall ensure, at a minimum, 
that:
    (a) Tests and other evaluation materials--
    (1) Are provided and administered in the child's native language or 
other mode of communication, unless it is clearly not feasible to do so;
    (2) Have been validated for the specific purpose for which they are 
used; and
    (3) Are administered by trained personnel in conformance with the 
instructions provided by their producer.
    (b) Tests and other evaluation materials include those tailored to 
assess specific areas of educational need and not merely those that are 
designed to provide a single general intelligence quotient.
    (c) Tests are selected and administered so as best to ensure that 
when a test is administered to a child with impaired sensory, manual, or 
speaking skills, the test results accurately reflect the child's 
aptitude or achievement level or whatever other factors the test 
purports to measure, rather than reflecting the child's impaired 
sensory, manual, or speaking skills (except where those skills are the 
factors that the test purports to measure).
    (d) No single procedure is used as the sole criterion for 
determining an appropriate educational program for a child.
    (e) The evaluation is made by a multidisciplinary team or group of 
persons, including at least one teacher or other specialist with 
knowledge in the area of suspected disability.
    (f) The child is assessed in all areas related to the suspected 
disability, including, if appropriate, health, vision, hearing, social 
and emotional status, general intelligence, academic performance, 
communicative status, and motor abilities.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1412(5)(C))


    Note: Children who have a speech or language impairment as their 
primary disability may not need a complete battery of assessments (e.g., 
psychological, physical, or adaptive behavior). However, a qualified 
speech-language pathologist would: (1) Evaluate each child with a speech 
or language impairment using procedures that are appropriate for the 
diagnosis and appraisal of speech and language impairments, and (2) if 
necessary, make referrals for additional assessments needed to make an 
appropriate placement decision.

<R05>
Sec. 300.533  Placement procedures.

    (a) In interpreting evaluation data and in making placement 
decisions, each public agency shall--
    (1) Draw upon information from a variety of sources, including 
aptitude and achievement tests, teacher recommendations, physical 
condition, social or cultural background, and adaptive behavior;
    (2) Ensure that information obtained from all of these sources is 
documented and carefully considered;
    (3) Ensure that the placement decision is made by a group of 
persons, including persons knowledgeable about the child, the meaning of 
the evaluation data, and the placement options; and
    (4) Ensure that the placement decision is made in conformity with 
the LRE rules in Secs. 300.550-300.554.
    (b) If a determination is made that a child has a disability and 
needs special education and related services, an IEP must be developed 
for the child in accordance with Secs. 300.340-300.350.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1412(5)(C); 1414(a)(5))


    Note: Paragraph (a)(1) of this section includes a list of examples 
of sources that may be used by a public agency in making placement 
decisions. The agency would not have to use all the sources in every 
instance. The point of the requirement is to ensure that more than one 
source is used in interpreting evaluation data and in making placement 
decisions. For example, while all of the named sources would have to be 
used for a

[[Page 55]]

child whose suspected disability is mental retardation, they would not 
be necessary for certain other children with disabilities, such as a 
child who has a severe articulation impairment as his primary 
disability. For such a child, the speech-language pathologist, in 
complying with the multiple source requirement, might use: (1) A 
standardized test of articulation, and (2) observation of the child's 
articulation behavior in conversational speech.

    (b) That an evaluation of the child, based on procedures that meet 
the requirements of Sec. 300.532, is conducted every three years, or 
more frequently if conditions warrant, or if the child's parent or 
teacher requests an evaluation.

  Additional Procedures for Evaluating Children With Specific Learning 
                              Disabilities


<R05>
Sec. 300.540  Additional team members.

    In evaluating a child suspected of having a specific learning 
disability, in addition to the requirements of Sec. 300.532, each public 
agency shall include on the multidisciplinary evaluation team--
    (a)(1) The child's regular teacher; or
    (2) If the child does not have a regular teacher, a regular 
classroom teacher qualified to teach a child of his or her age; or
    (3) For a child of less than school age, an individual qualified by 
the SEA to teach a child of his or her age; and
    (b) At least one person qualified to conduct individual diagnostic 
examinations of children, such as a school psychologist, speech-language 
pathologist, or remedial reading teacher.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1411 note)


<R05>
Sec. 300.541  Criteria for determining the existence of a specific learning disability.

    (a) A team may determine that a child has a specific learning 
disability if--
    (1) The child does not achieve commensurate with his or her age and 
ability levels in one or more of the areas listed in paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section, when provided with learning experiences appropriate for 
the child's age and ability levels; and
    (2) The team finds that a child has a severe discrepancy between

    (iii) Written expression;
    (iv) Basic reading skill;
    (v) Reading comprehension;
    (vi) Mathematics calculation; or
    (vii) Mathematics reasoning.
    (b) The team may not identify a child as having a specific learning 
disability if the severe discrepancy between ability and achievement is 
primarily the result of--
    (1) A visual, hearing, or motor impairment;
    (2) Mental retardation;
    (3) Emotional disturbance; or
    (4) Environmental, cultural or economic disadvantage.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1411 note)


<R05>
Sec. 300.542  Observation.

    (a) At least one team member other than the child's regular teacher 
shall observe the child's academic performance in the regular classroom 
setting.
    (b) In the case of a child of less than school age or out of school, 
a team member shall observe the child in an environment appropriate for 
a child of that age.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1411 note)


<R05>
Sec. 300.543  Written report.

    (a) The team shall prepare a written report of the results of the 
evaluation.
    (b) The report must include a statement of--
    (1) Whether the child has a specific learning disability;

    (4) The relationship of that behavior to the child's academic 
functioning;
    (5) The educationally relevant medical findings, if any;
    (6) Whether there is a severe discrepancy between achievement and 
ability that is not correctable without special education and related 
services; and
    (7) The determination of the team concerning the effects of 
environmental, cultural, or economic disadvantage.
    (c) Each team member shall certify in writing whether the report

300.556.
    (b) Each public agency shall ensure--
    (1) That to the maximum extent appropriate, children with 
disabilities, including children in public or private institutions or 
other care facilities, are educated with children who are nondisabled; 
and
    (2) That special classes, separate schooling or other removal of 
children with disabilities from the regular educational environment 
occurs only when the nature or severity of the disability is such that 
education in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and 
services cannot be achieved satisfactorily.

<R05>
Sec. 300.551  Continuum of alternative placements.

    (a) Each public agency shall ensure that a continuum of alternative 
placements is available to meet the needs of children with disabilities 
for special education and related services.
    (b) The continuum required in paragraph (a) of this section must--
    (1) Include the alternative placements listed in the definition of 
special education under Sec. 300.17 (instruction in regular classes, 
special classes, special schools, home instruction, and instruction in 
hospitals and institutions); and
    (2) Make provision for supplementary services (such as resource room 
or itinerant instruction) to be provided in conjunction with regular 
class placement.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1412(5)(B))


<R05>
Sec. 300.552  Placements.

    Each public agency shall ensure that:
    (a) The educational placement of each child with a disability--
    (1) Is determined at least annually;
    (2) Is based on his or her IEP; and
    (3) Is as close as possible to the child's home.
    (b) The various alternative placements included at Sec. 300.551 are 
available to the extent necessary to implement the IEP for each child 
with a disability.
    (c) Unless the IEP of a child with a disability requires some other 
arrangement, the child is educated in the school that he or she would 
attend if nondisabled.
    (d) In selecting the LRE, consideration is given to any potential 
harmful effect on the child or on the quality of services that he or she 
needs.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1412(5)(B))


    Note: Section 300.552 includes some of the main factors that must be 
considered in determining the extent to which a child with a disability 
can be educated with children who are nondisabled. The overriding rule 
in this section is that placement decisions must be made on an 
individual basis. The section also requires each agency to have various 
alternative placements available in order to ensure that each child with 
a disability receives an education that is appropriate to his or her 
individual needs.
    The requirements of Sec. 300.552, as well as the other requirements 
of Secs. 300.550-300.556, apply to all preschool children with 
disabilities who are entitled to receive FAPE. Public agencies that 
provide preschool programs for nondisabled preschool children must 
ensure that the requirements of Sec. 300.552(c) are met.

[[Page 57]]

Public agencies that do not operate programs for nondisabled preschool 
children are not required to initiate such programs solely to satisfy 
the requirements regarding placement in the LRE embodied in 
Secs. 300.550-300.556. For these public agencies, some alternative 
methods for meeting the requirements of Secs. 300.550-300.556 include--
    (1) Providing opportunities for the participation (even part-time) 
of preschool children with disabilities in other preschool programs 
operated by public agencies (such as Head Start);
    (2) Placing children with disabilities in private school programs 
for nondisabled preschool children or private school preschool programs 
that integrate children with disabilities and nondisabled children; and
    (3) Locating classes for preschool children with disabilities in 
regular elementary schools.
    In each case the public agency must ensure that each child's 
placement is in the LRE in which the unique needs of that child can be 
met, based upon the child's IEP, and meets all of the other requirements 
of Secs. 300.340-300.350 and Secs. 300.550-300.556.
    The analysis of the regulations for section 504 of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (34 CFR part 104--Appendix, Paragraph 24) 
includes several points regarding educational placements of children 
with disabilities that are pertinent to this section:
    1. With respect to determining proper placements, the analysis 
states: ``* * * it should be stressed that, where a handicapped child is 
so disruptive in a regular classroom that the education of other 
students is significantly impaired, the needs of the handicapped child 
cannot be met in that environment. Therefore regular placement would not 
be appropriate to his or her needs * * *.''
    2. With respect to placing a child with a disability in an alternate 
setting, the analysis states that among the factors to be considered in 
placing a child is the need to place the child as close to home as 
possible. Recipients are required to take this factor into account in 
making placement decisions. The parents' right to challenge the 
placement of their child extends not only to placement in special 
classes or separate schools, but also to placement in a distant school, 
particularly in a residential program. An equally appropriate education 
program may exist closer to home; and this issue may be raised by the 
parent under the due process provisions of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 300.553  Nonacademic settings.

    In providing or arranging for the provision of nonacademic and 
extracurricular services and activities, including meals, recess 
periods, and the services and activities set forth in Sec. 300.306, each 
public agency shall ensure that each child with a disability 
participates with nondisabled children in those services and activities 
to the maximum extent appropriate to the needs of that child.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1412(5)(B))


    Note: Section 300.553 is taken from a requirement in the final 
regulations for section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. With 
respect to this requirement, the analysis of the section 504 regulations 
includes the following statement: ``[This paragraph] specifies that 
handicapped children must also be provided nonacademic services in as 
integrated a setting as possible. This requirement is especially 
important for children whose educational needs necessitate their being 
solely with other handicapped children during most of each day. To the 
maximum extent appropriate, children in residential settings are also to 
be provided opportunities for participation with other children.'' (34 
CFR part 104--Appendix, Paragraph 24.)


<R05>
Sec. 300.554  Children in public or private institutions.

    Each SEA shall make arrangements with public and private 
institutions (such as a memorandum of agreement or special 
implementation procedures) as may be necessary to ensure that 
Sec. 300.550 is effectively implemented.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1412(5)(B))


    Note: Under section 612(5)(B) of the statute, the requirement to 
educate children with disabilities with nondisabled children also 
applies to children in public and private institutions or other care 
facilities. Each SEA must ensure that each applicable agency and 
institution in the State implements this requirement. Regardless of 
other reasons for institutional placement, no child in an institution 
who is capable of education in a regular public school setting may be 
denied access to an education in that setting.


<R05>
Sec. 300.555  Technical assistance and training activities.

    Each SEA shall carry out activities to ensure that teachers and 
administrators in all public agencies--
    (a) Are fully informed about their responsibilities for implementing 
Sec. 300.550; and

[[Page 58]]

    (b) Are provided with technical assistance and training necessary to 
assist them in this effort.

is implemented by each public agency.
    (b) If there is evidence that a public agency makes placements that 
are inconsistent with Sec. 300.550, the SEA shall--
    (1) Review the public agency's justification for its actions; and
    (2) Assist in planning and implementing any necessary corrective 
action.

parents request that it be destroyed. Destruction of records is the best 
protection against improper and unauthorized disclosure. However, the 
records may be needed for other purposes. In informing parents about 
their rights under this section, the agency should remind them that the 
records may be needed by the child or the parents for social security

Sec. 300.588  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 300.589  Waiver of requirement regarding supplementing and supplanting with part B funds.

    (a) Under sections 613(a)(9)(B) and 614(a)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act, 
SEAs and LEAs must ensure that Federal funds provided under this part 
are used to supplement and increase the level of Federal, State, and 
local funds (including funds that are not under the direct control of 
SEAs or LEAs) expended for special education and related services 
provided to children with disabilities under this part and in no case to 
supplant those Federal, State, and local funds. The nonsupplanting 
requirement applies only to funds allocated to LEAs (See Sec. 300.372).
    (b) If the State provides clear and convincing evidence that all 
children with disabilities have FAPE available to them, the Secretary 
may waive in part the requirement under sections 613(a)(9)(B) and 
614(a)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act if the Secretary concurs with the evidence 
provided by the State.
    (c) If a State wishes to request a waiver, it must inform the 
Secretary in writing. The Secretary then provides the State with a 
finance and membership report form that provides the basis for the 
request.
    (d) In its request for a waiver, the State shall include the results 
of a special study made by the State to obtain evidence of the 
availability of FAPE to all children with disabilities. The special 
study must include statements by a representative sample of 
organizations that deal with children with disabilities, and parents and 
teachers of children with disabilities, relating to the following 
areas--
    (1) The adequacy and comprehensiveness of the State's system for 
identifying, locating, and evaluating children with disabilities;
    (2) The cost to parents, if any, for education for children enrolled 
in public and private day schools, and in public and private residential 
schools and institutions; and
    (3) The adequacy of the State's due process procedures.
    (e) In its request for a waiver, the State shall include finance 
data relating to the availability of FAPE for all children with 
disabilities, including--
    (1) The total current expenditures for regular education programs 
and special education programs by function and by source of funds 
(State, local, and Federal) for the previous school year; and
    (2) The full-time equivalent membership of students enrolled in 
regular programs and in special programs in the previous school year.
    (f) The Secretary considers the information that the State provides 
under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, along with any additional 
information he may request, or obtain through on-site reviews of the 
State's education programs and records, to determine if all children 
have FAPE available to them, and if so, the extent of the waiver.

    (g) The State may request a hearing with regard to any final action 
by the Secretary under this section.

<R05>
Sec. 300.600  Responsibility for all educational programs.

    (a) The SEA is responsible for ensuring--
    (1) That the requirements of this part are carried out; and
    (2) That each educational program for children with disabilities 
administered within the State, including each program administered by 
any other public agency--
    (i) Is under the general supervision of the persons responsible for 
educational programs for children with disabilities in the SEA; and
    (ii) Meets the education standards of the SEA (including the 
requirements of this part).
    (b) The State must comply with paragraph (a) of this section through 
State statute, State regulation, signed agreement between respective 
agency officials, or other documents.
    (c) This part may not be construed to limit the responsibility of 
agencies other than educational agencies for providing or paying some or 
all of the costs of FAPE to children with disabilities in the State.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1412(6))


    Note: The requirement in Sec. 300.600(a) is taken essentially 
verbatim from section 612(6) of the statute and reflects the desire of 
the Congress for a central point of responsibility and accountability in 
the education of children with disabilities within each State. With 
respect to SEA responsibility, the Senate Report on Pub. L. 94-142 
includes the following statements:
    This provision is included specifically to assure a single line of 
responsibility with regard to the education of handicapped children, and 
to assure that in the implementation of all provisions of this Act and 
in carrying out the right to education for handicapped children, the 
State educational agency shall be the responsible agency * * *.
    Without this requirement, there is an abdication of responsibility 
for the education of handicapped children. Presently, in many States, 
responsibility is divided, depending upon the age of the handicapped 
child, sources of funding, and type of services delivered. While the 
Committee understands that different agencies may, in fact, deliver 
services, the responsibility must remain in a central agency overseeing 
the education of handicapped children, so that failure to deliver 
services or the violation of the rights of handicapped children is 
squarely the responsibility of one agency. (S. Rep. No. 94-168, p. 24 
(1975))
    In meeting the requirements of this section, there are a number of 
acceptable options that may be adopted, including the following:
    (1) Written agreements are developed between respective State 
agencies concerning SEA standards and monitoring. These agreements are 
binding on the local or regional counterparts of each State agency.
    (2) The Governor's Office issues an administrative directive 
establishing the SEA responsibility.
    (3) State law, regulation, or policy designates the SEA as 
responsible for establishing standards for all educational programs for 
individuals with disabilities, and includes responsibility for 
monitoring.
    (4) State law mandates that the SEA is responsible for all 
educational programs.

    (a) Each State shall establish, in accordance with the provisions of 
Secs. 300.650-300.653, a State advisory panel on the education of 
children with disabilities.
    (b) The advisory panel must be appointed by the Governor or any 
other official authorized under State law to make those appointments.
    (c) If a State has an existing advisory panel that can perform the 
functions in Sec. 300.652, the State may modify the existing panel so 
that it fulfills all of the requirements of Secs. 300.650-300.653, 
instead of establishing a new advisory panel.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1413(a)(12))


<R05>
Sec. 300.651  Membership.

    (a) The membership of the State advisory panel must be composed of 
persons involved in or concerned with the education of children with 
disabilities. The membership must include at least one person 
representative of each of the following groups--
    (1) Individuals with disabilities;
    (2) Teachers of children with disabilities;
    (3) Parents of children with disabilities;
    (4) State and local educational officials; and
    (5) Special education program administrators.
    (b) The State may expand the advisory panel to include additional 
persons in the groups listed in paragraph (a) of this section and 
representatives of other groups not listed.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1413(a)(12))


    Note: The membership of the State advisory panel, as listed in 
paragraphs (a)(1)-(5) of this section, is required in section 613(a)(12) 
of the Act. As indicated in paragraph (b) of this section, the 
composition of the panel and the number of members may be expanded at 
the discretion of the State. In adding to the membership, consideration 
could be given to having--
    (1) An appropriate balance between professional groups and consumers 
(i.e., parents, advocates, and individuals with disabilities);
    (2) Broad representation within the consumer-advocate groups, to 
ensure that the interests and points of view of various parents, 
advocates and individuals with disabilities are appropriately 
represented;
    (3) Broad representation within professional groups (e.g., regular 
education personnel: special educators, including teachers, teacher 
trainers, and administrators, who can properly represent various 
dimensions in the education of children with disabilities; and 
appropriate related services personnel); and
    (4) Representatives from other State advisory panels (such as 
vocational education).
    If a State elects to maintain a small advisory panel (e.g., 10-15 
members), the panel itself could take steps to ensure that it (1) 
consults with and receives inputs from various consumer and special 
interest professional groups, and (2) establishes committees for 
particular short-term purposes composed of representatives from those 
input groups.


<R05>
Sec. 300.652  Advisory panel functions.

    The State advisory panel shall--

[[Page 67]]

    (a) Advise the SEA of unmet needs within the State in the education 
of children with disabilities;
    (b) Comment publicly on the State plan and rules or regulations 
proposed for issuance by the State regarding the education of children 
with disabilities and the procedures for distribution of funds under 
this part; and
    (c) Assist the State in developing and reporting such information

    (a) The Secretary calculates the maximum amount of the grant to 
which a State is entitled under section 611 of the Act in any fiscal 
year as follows:
    (1) If the State is eligible for a grant under section 619 of the 
Act, the maximum entitlement is equal to the number of children with 
disabilities aged 3 through 21 in the State who are receiving special 
education and related services, multiplied by 40 percent of the average 
per pupil expenditure in public elementary and secondary schools in the 
United States.
    (2) If the State is not eligible for a grant under section 619 of 
the Act, the maximum entitlement is equal to the number of children with 
disabilities aged 6 through 21 in the State who are receiving special 
education and related services, multiplied by 40 percent of the average 
per pupil expenditure in public elementary and secondary schools in the 
United States.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1411(a)(1))

    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) For the purposes of this section, the average per pupil 
expenditure in public elementary and secondary schools in the United 
States, means the aggregate expenditures during the second fiscal year 
preceding the fiscal year for which the computation is made (or if 
satisfactory data for that year are not available at the time of 
computation, then during the most recent preceding fiscal year for which 
satisfactory data are available) of all LEAs in the United States 
(which, for the purpose of this section, means the 50 States and the 
District of Columbia), plus any direct expenditures by the State for 
operation of those agencies (without regard to the source of funds from 
which either of those expenditures are made), divided by the aggregate 
number of children in average daily attendance to whom those agencies 
provided free public education during that preceding year.

children is greater than 12 percent of the number of all children aged 3 
through 17 in the State.
    (2) If a State does not serve all children with disabilities aged 3 
through 5 in the State, the Secretary does not count children with 
disabilities aged 5

[[Page 69]]

through 17 to the extent that the number of those children is greater 
than 12 percent of the number of all children aged 5 through 17 in the 
State.
    (3) The Secretary does not count children with disabilities who are 
counted under subpart 2 of part D of chapter 1 of title I of the 
Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965.

services.

    Note: It is very important to understand that this report and the 
requirements that relate to it are solely for allocation purposes. The 
population of children the State may count for allocation purposes may 
differ from the population of children to whom the State must make FAPE 
available. For example, while section 611(a)(5) of the Act limits the 
number of children who may be counted for allocation purposes to 12 
percent of the general school population aged 3 through 17 (in States 
that serve all children with disabilities aged 3 through 5) or 5 through 
17 (in States that do not serve all children with disabilities aged 3 
through 5), a State might find that 14 percent (or some other 
percentage) of its children have disabilities. In that case, the State 
must make FAPE available to all of those children with disabilities.

Sec. 300.753  Annual report of children served--criteria for counting children.

    (a) The SEA may include in its report children with disabilities who 
are enrolled in a school or program that is operated or supported by a 
public agency, and that either--
    (1) Provides them with both special education and related services; 
or
    (2) Provides them only with special education if they do not need 
related services to assist them in benefitting from that special 
education.
    (b) The SEA may not include children with disabilities in its report 
who--
    (1) Are not enrolled in a school or program operated or supported by 
a public agency;
    (2) Are not provided special education that meets State standards;
    (3) Are not provided with a related service that they need to assist 
them in benefitting from special education;
    (4) Are counted by a State agency under subpart 2 of part D of 
chapter 1 of title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 
1965; or
    (5) Are receiving special education funded solely by the Federal 
Government. However, the State may count children covered under 
Sec. 300.186(b).

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1411(a)(3); 1417(b))


    Note 1: Under paragraph (a) of this section, the State may count 
children with disabilities in a Head Start or other preschool program 
operated or supported by a public agency if those children are provided 
special education that meets State standards.


    Note 2: Special education, by statutory definition, must be at no 
cost to parents. As of September 1, 1978, under the FAPE requirement, 
both special education and related services must be at no cost to 
parents.
    There may be some situations, however, where a child receives 
special education from a public source at no cost, but whose parents pay 
for the basic or regular education. This child may be counted. The 
Department expects that there would only be limited situations where 
special education would be clearly separate from regular education--
generally, where speech services is the only special education required 
by the child. For example, the child's parents may have enrolled the 
child in a regular program in a private school, but the child might be 
receiving speech services in a program funded by the LEA. Allowing these 
children to be counted will provide incentives (in addition to complying 
with the legal requirement in section 613(a)(4)(A) of the Act regarding 
private schools) to public agencies to provide services to children 
enrolled by their parents in private schools, since funds are generated 
in part on the basis of the number of children provided special 
education and related services. Agencies should understand, however, 
that if a public agency places or refers a child with a disability to a 
public or private school for educational purposes, special education 
includes the entire educational program provided to the child. In that 
case, parents may not be charged for any part of the child's education.
    A State may not count Indian children on or near reservations and 
children on military facilities if it provides them no special 
education. If an SEA or LEA is responsible for serving these children, 
and does provide them special education and related services, they may 
be counted.

    In addition to meeting the other requirements of Secs. 300.750-

    (a) Establish procedures to be used by LEAs and other educational 
institutions in counting the number of children with disabilities 
receiving special education and related services;
    (b) Set dates by which those agencies and institutions must report 
to the SEA to ensure that the State complies with Sec. 300.750(a);
    (c) Obtain certification from each agency and institution that an 
unduplicated and accurate count has been made;
    (d) Aggregate the data from the count obtained from each agency and 
institution, and prepare the reports required under Secs. 300.750-
300.753; and

    Authority: Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act 
(20 U.S.C. 1411-1420), unless otherwise noted.

                Individualized Education Programs (IEPs)

    Interpretation of Requirements of Part B of the Individuals with 
                       Disabilities Education Act

                          I. Purpose of the IEP

    There are two main parts of the IEP requirement, as described in the 
Act and regulations: (1) The IEP meeting(s), where parents and school 
personnel jointly make decisions about an educational program for a 
child with a disability, and (2) the IEP document itself, that is, a 
written record of the decisions reached at the meeting. The overall IEP 
requirement, comprised of these two parts, has a number of purposes and 
functions:

[[Page 75]]

    a. The IEP meeting serves as a communication vehicle between parents 
and school personnel, and enables them, as equal participants, to 
jointly decide what the child's needs are, what services will be 
provided to meet those needs, and what the anticipated outcomes may be.
    b. The IEP process provides an opportunity for resolving any 
differences between the parents and the agency concerning the special 
education needs of a child with a disability; first, through the IEP 
meeting, and second, if necessary, through the procedural protections 
that are available to the parents.
    c. The IEP sets forth in writing a commitment of resources necessary 
to enable a child with a disability to receive needed special education 
and related services.
    d. The IEP is a management tool that is used to ensure that each 
child with a disability is provided special education and related 
services appropriate to the child's special learning needs.
    e. The IEP is a compliance/monitoring document that may be used by 
authorized monitoring personnel from each governmental level to 
determine whether a child with a disability is actually receiving the 
FAPE agreed to by the parents and the school.
    f. The IEP serves as an evaluation device for use in determining the 
extent of the child's progress toward meeting the projected outcomes.

    Note: The Act does not require that teachers or other school 
personnel be held accountable if a child with a disability does not 
achieve the goals and objectives set forth in the IEP. See Sec. 300.350, 
Individualized education program--accountability.

                          II. IEP Requirements

    This part (1) repeats the IEP requirements in Secs. 300.340-300.350 
of the regulations (boxed material), (2) provides additional 
clarification, as necessary, on sections or paragraphs of the 
regulations on which such clarification is needed, and (3) answers some 
questions regarding implementation of the IEP requirements that are not 
expressly addressed in the regulations. These questions and clarifying 
information are presented in a question and answer format immediately 
after the particular section of the regulations that is presented.

                       Sec. 300.340  Definitions.

    (a) As used in this part, the term individualized education program 
means a written statement for a child with a disability that is 
developed and implemented in accordance with Secs. 300.341-300.350.
    (b) As used in Secs. 300.346 and 300.347, participating agency means 
a State or local agency, other than the public agency responsible for a 
student's education, that is financially and legally responsible for 
providing transition services to the student.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1401(a)(20))

         Sec. 300.341  State educational agency responsibility.

    (a) Public agencies. The SEA shall ensure that each public agency 
develops and implements an IEP for each of its children with 
disabilities.
    (b) Private schools and facilities. The SEA shall ensure that an IEP 
is developed and implemented for each child with a disability who--
    (1) Is placed in or referred to a private school or facility by a 
public agency; or
    (2) Is enrolled in a parochial school or other private school and 
receives special education or related services from a public agency.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1412(4), (6); 1413(a)(4))

    Note: This section applies to all public agencies, including other 
State agencies (e.g., departments of mental health and welfare) that 
provide special education to a child with a disability either directly, 
by contract or through other arrangements. Thus, if a State welfare 
agency contracts with a private school or facility to provide special 
education to a child with a disability, that agency would be responsible 
for ensuring that an IEP is developed for the child.
    1. Who is responsible for ensuring the development of IEPs for 
children with disabilities served by a public agency other than an LEA?
    The answer will vary from State to State, depending upon State law, 
policy, or practice. In each State, however, the SEA is ultimately 
responsible for ensuring that each agency in the State is in compliance 
with the IEP requirements and the other provisions of the Act and 
regulations. (See Sec. 300.600 regarding SEA responsibility for all 
education programs.)
    The SEA must ensure that every child with a disability in the State 
has FAPE available, regardless of which agency, State or local, is 
responsible for the child. While the SEA has flexibility in deciding the 
best means to meet this obligation (e.g., through interagency 
agreements), there can be no failure to provide FAPE due to 
jurisdictional disputes among agencies.


    Note: Section 300.2(b) states that the requirements of the Act and 
regulations apply to all political subdivisions of the State that are 
involved in the education of children with disabilities, including (1) 
the SEA, (2) LEAs, (3) other State agencies (such as Departments of 
Mental Health and Welfare, and State schools for students with deafness 
or students with blindness), and (4) State correctional facilities.

[[Page 76]]

    The following paragraphs outline (1) some of the SEA's 
responsibilities for developing policies or agreements under a variety 
of interagency situations, and (2) some of the responsibilities of an 
LEA when it initiates the placement of a child with a disability in a 
school or program operated by another State agency:
    a. SEA POLICIES OR INTERAGENCY AGREEMENTS. The SEA, through its 
written policies or agreements, must ensure that IEPs are properly 
written and implemented for all children with disabilities in the State. 
This applies to each interagency situation that exists in the State, 
including any of the following:
    (1) When an LEA initiates the placement of a child in a school or 
program operated by another State agency (see ``LEA-Initiated 
Placements'' in paragraph ``b'', below); (2) when a State or local 
agency other than the SEA or LEA places a child in a residential 
facility or other program; (3) when parents initiate placements in 
public institutions; and (4) when the courts make placements in 
correctional facilities.


    Note: This is not an exhaustive list. The SEA's policies must cover 
any other interagency situation that is applicable in the State, 
including placements that are made for both educational and for non-
educational purposes.
    Frequently, more than one agency is involved in developing or 
implementing an IEP of a child with a disability (e.g., when the LEA 
remains responsible for the child, even though another public agency 
provides the special education and related services, or when there are 
shared cost arrangements). It is important that SEA policies or 
agreements define the role of each agency involved in the situations 
described above, in order to resolve any jurisdictional problems that 
could delay the provision of FAPE to a child with a disability. For 
example, if a child is placed in a residential facility, any one or all 
of the following agencies might be involved in the development and/or 
implementation of the child's IEP: The child's LEA, the SEA, another 
State agency, an institution or school under that agency, and the LEA 
where the institution is located.


    Note: The SEA must also ensure that any agency involved in the 
education of a child with a disability is in compliance with the LRE 
provisions of the Act and regulations, and, specifically, with the 
requirement that the placement of each child with a disability (1) be 
determined at least annually, (2) be based on the child's IEP, and (3) 
be as close as possible to the child's home (Sec. 300.552(a), 
Placements.)


    b. LEA-INITIATED PLACEMENTS. When an LEA is responsible for the 
education of a child with a disability, the LEA is also responsible for 
developing the child's IEP. The LEA has this responsibility even if 
development of the IEP results in placement in a State-operated school 
or program.

    Note: The IEP must be developed before the child is placed. (See 
Question 5, below.) When placement in a State-operated school is 
necessary, the affected State agency or agencies must be involved by the 
LEA in the development of the IEP. (See response to Question 59, below, 
regarding participation of a private school representative at the IEP 
meeting.)

    After the child enters the State school, meetings to review or 
revise the child's IEP could be conducted by either the LEA or the State 
school, depending upon State law, policy, or practice. However, both 
agencies should be involved in any decisions made about the child's IEP 
(either by attending the IEP meetings, or through correspondence or 
telephone calls). There must be a clear decision, based on State law, as 
to whether responsibility for the child's education is transferred to 
the State school or remains with the LEA, since this decision determines 
which agency is responsible for reviewing or revising the child's IEP.
    2. For a child placed out of State by a public agency, is the 
placing or receiving State responsible for the child's IEP?
    The ``placing'' State is responsible for developing the child's IEP 
and ensuring that it is implemented. The determination of the specific 
agency in the placing State that is responsible for the child's IEP 
would be based on State law, policy, or practice. However, as indicated 
in Question 1, above, the SEA in the placing State is responsible for 
ensuring that the child has FAPE available.

 Sec. 300.342  When individualized education programs must be in effect.

    (a) At the beginning of each school year, each public agency shall 
have in effect an IEP for every child with a disability who is receiving 
special education from that agency.
    (b) An IEP must--
    (1) Be in effect before special education and related services are 
provided to a child; and
    (2) Be implemented as soon as possible following the meetings under 
Sec. 300.343.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1412(2)(B), (4), (6); 1414(a)(5); Pub. L. 94-142, 
sec. 8(c) (1975))

    Note: Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, it is expected that 
the IEP of a child with a disability will be implemented immediately 
following the meetings under Sec. 300.343. An exception to this would be 
(1) when the meetings occur during the summer or a vacation period, or 
(2) where there are circumstances that require a short delay (e.g., 
working out transportation arrangements). However, there can be no undue

[[Page 77]]

delay in providing special education and related services to the child.

    3. In requiring that an IEP be in effect before special education 
and related services are provided, what does ``be in effect'' mean?
    As used in the regulations, the term be in effect means that the IEP 
(1) has been developed properly (i.e., at a meeting(s) involving all of 
the participants specified in the Act (parent, teacher, agency 
representative, and, if appropriate, the child)); (2) is regarded by 
both the parents and agency as appropriate in terms of the child's 
needs, specified goals and objectives, and the services to be provided; 
and (3) will be implemented as written.
    4. How much of a delay is permissible between the time an IEP of a 
child with a disability is finalized and when special education is 
provided?
    In general, no delay is permissible. It is expected that the special 
education and related services set out in a child's IEP will be provided 
by the agency beginning immediately after the IEP is finalized. The Note 
following Sec. 300.342 identifies some exceptions ((1) when the meetings 
occur during the summer or other vacation period, or (2) when there are 
circumstances that require a short delay, such as working out 
transportation arrangements). However, unless otherwise specified in the 
IEP, the IEP services must be provided as soon as possible following the 
meeting.

    Note: Section 300.346(a)(4) requires that the IEP include the 
projected dates for initiation of services.

    5. For a child with a disability receiving special education for the 
first time, when must an IEP be developed -- before placement or after 
placement?
    An IEP must be in effect before special education and related 
services are provided to a child. (Sec. 300.342(b)(1), emphasis added.) 
The appropriate placement for a given child with a disability cannot be 
determined until after decisions have been made about what the child's 
needs are and what will be provided. Since these decisions are made at 
the IEP meeting, it would not be permissible to first place the child 
and then develop the IEP. Therefore, the IEP must be developed before 
placement. The above requirement does not preclude temporarily placing 
an eligible child with a disability in a program as part of the 
evaluation process--before the IEP is finalized--to aid in determining 
the most appropriate placement for the child. It is essential that the 
temporary placement not become the final placement before the IEP is 
finalized. In order to ensure that this does not happen, the State might 
consider requiring LEAs to take the following actions:
    a. Develop an interim IEP for the child that sets out the specific 
conditions and timelines for the trial placement. (See paragraph ``c'', 
below.)
    b. Ensure that the parents agree to the interim placement before it 
is carried out, and that they are involved throughout the process of 
developing, reviewing, and revising the child's IEP.
    c. Set a specific timeline (e.g., 30 days) for completing the 
evaluation and making judgments about the most appropriate placement for 
the child.
    d. Conduct an IEP meeting at the end of the trial period in order to 
finalize the child's IEP.

    Note: Once the IEP of the child with a disability is in effect and 
the child is placed in a special education program, the teacher might 
develop detailed lesson plans or objectives based on the IEP. However, 
these lesson plans and objectives are not required to be a part of the 
IEP itself. (See Questions 3743, below, regarding IEP goals and 
objectives.)

    6. If a child with a disability has been receiving special education 
in one LEA and moves to another community, must the new LEA hold an IEP 
meeting before the child is placed in a special education program?
    It would not be necessary for the new LEA to conduct an IEP meeting 
if:
    (1) A copy of the child's current IEP is available; (2) the parents 
indicate that they are satisfied with the current IEP; and (3) the new 
LEA determines that the current IEP is appropriate and can be 
implemented as written.
    If the child's current IEP is not available, or if either the LEA or 
the parent believes that it is not appropriate, an IEP meeting would 
have to be conducted. This meeting should take place within a short time 
after the child enrolls in the new LEA (normally, within one week).

    Note: The child must be placed in a special education program 
immediately after the IEP is finalized. (See Question 4, above.)
    If the LEA or the parents believe that additional information is 
needed (e.g., the school records from the former LEA) or that a new 
evaluation is necessary before a final placement decision can be made, 
it would be permissible to temporarily place the child in an interim 
program before the IEP is finalized. (See Question 5, above.)

                         Sec. 300.343  Meetings.

    (a) General. Each public agency is responsible for initiating and 
conducting meetings for the purpose of developing, reviewing, and 
revising the IEP of a child with a disability (or, if consistent with 
State policy and at the discretion of the LEA, and with the concurrence 
of the parents, an individualized family service plan described in 
section 677(d) of the Act for each child with a disability, aged 3 
through 5).

[[Page 78]]

    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) Timeline. A meeting to develop an IEP for a child must be held 
within 30 calendar days of a determination that the child needs special 
education and related services.
    (d) Review. Each public agency shall initiate and conduct meetings 
to review each child's IEP periodically and, if appropriate, revise its 
provisions. A meeting must be held for this purpose at least once a 
year.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1412(2)(B), (4), (6); 1414(a)(5))

    Note: The date on which agencies must have IEPs in effect is 
specified in Sec. 300.342 (the beginning of each school year). However, 
except for new children with disabilities (i.e., those evaluated and 
determined to need special education and related services for the first 
time), the timing of meetings to develop, review, and revise IEPs is 
left to the discretion of each agency. In order to have IEPs in effect 
at the beginning of the school year, agencies could hold meetings either 
at the end of the preceding school year or during the summer prior to 
the next school year. Meetings may be held any time throughout the year, 
as long as IEPs are in effect at the beginning of each school year.

    The statute requires agencies to hold a meeting at least once each 
year in order to review and, if appropriate, revise each child's IEP. 
The timing of those meetings could be on the anniversary date of the 
child's last IEP meeting, but this is left to the discretion of the 
agency.

    7. What is the purpose of the 30 day timeline in Sec. 300.343(c)?
    The 30 day timeline in Sec. 300.343(c) ensures that there will not 
be a significant delay between the time a child is evaluated and when 
the child begins to receive special education. Once it is determined--
through the evaluation--that a child has a disability, the public agency 
has up to 30 days to hold an IEP meeting.

    Note: See Questions 4 and 5, above, regarding finalization of IEP 
and placement of the child.

    8. Must the agency hold a separate meeting to determine a child's 
eligibility for special education and related services, or can this step 
be combined with the IEP meeting?
    Paragraph (e) of Sec. 300.532 (Evaluation procedures) provides that 
the evaluation of each child with a disability must be ``made by a 
multidisciplinary team or group of persons * * *''. The decisions 
regarding (1) whether the team members actually meet together, and (2) 
whether such meetings are separate from the IEP meeting are matters that 
are left to the discretion of State or local agencies.
    In practice, some agencies hold separate eligibility meetings with 
the multidisciplinary team before the IEP meeting.

    Note: When separate meetings are conducted, placement decisions 
would be made at the IEP meeting. However, placement options could be 
discussed at the eligibility meeting.

    Other agencies combine the two steps into one. If a combined meeting 
is conducted, the public agency must include the parents as participants 
at the meeting. (See Sec. 300.345 for requirements on parent 
participation.)

    Note: If, at a separate eligibility meeting, a decision is made that 
a child is not eligible for special education, the parents should be 
notified about the decision.

    9. Must IEPs be reviewed or revised at the beginning of each school 
year?
    No. The basic requirement in the regulations is that IEPs must be in 
effect at the beginning of each school year. Meetings must be conducted 
at least once each year to review and, if necessary, revise the IEP of 
each child with a disability. However, the meetings may be held anytime 
during the year, including (1) at the end of the school year, (2) during 
the summer, before the new school year begins, or (3) on the anniversary 
date of the last IEP meeting on the child.
    10. How frequently must IEP meetings be held and how long should 
they be?
    Section 614(a)(5) of the Act provides that each public agency must 
hold meetings periodically, but not less than annually, to review each 
child's IEP and, if appropriate, revise its provisions. The legislative 
history of the Act makes it clear that there should be as many meetings 
a year as any one child may need. (121 Cong. Rec. S20428-29 (Nov. 19, 
1975) (remarks of Senator Stafford))
    There is no prescribed length for IEP meetings. In general, meetings 
(1) will be longer for initial placements and for children who require a 
variety of complex services, and (2) will be shorter for continuing 
placements and for children who require only a minimum amount of 
services. In any event, however, it is expected that agencies will allow 
sufficient time at the meetings to ensure meaningful parent 
participation.
    11. Who can initiate IEP meetings?
    IEP meetings are initiated and conducted at the discretion of the 
public agency. However, if the parents of a child with a disability 
believe that the child is not progressing satisfactorily or that there 
is a problem with the child's current IEP, it would be appropriate for 
the parents to request an IEP meeting. The public agency should grant 
any reasonable request for such a meeting.

    Note: Under Sec. 300.506(a), the parents or agency may initiate a 
due process hearing at any time regarding any matter related to the 
child's IEP.
    If a child's teacher(s) feels that the child's placement or IEP 
services are not appropriate to the child, the teacher(s) should follow 
agency procedures with respect to (1)

[[Page 79]]

calling or meeting with the parents and/or (2) requesting the agency to 
hold another meeting to review the child's IEP.

    12. May IEP meetings be tape-recorded?
    The use of tape recorders at IEP meetings is not addressed by either 
the Act or the regulations. Although taping is clearly not required, it 
is permissible at the option of either the parents or the agency. 
However, if the recording is maintained by the agency, it is an 
education record, within the meaning of the Family Educational Rights 
and Privacy Act (``FERPA''; 20 U.S.C. 1232g), and would, therefore, be 
subject to the confidentiality requirements of the regulations under 
both FERPA (34 CFR part 99) and part B (34 CFR Secs. 300.560-300.575).

                 Sec. 300.344  Participants in meetings.

    (a) General. The public agency shall ensure that each meeting 
includes the following participants:
    (1) A representative of the public agency, other than the child's 
teacher, who is qualified to provide, or supervise the provision of, 
special education.
    (2) The child's teacher.
    (3) One or both of the child's parents, subject to Sec. 300.345.
    (4) The child, if appropriate.
    (5) Other individuals at the discretion of the parent or agency.
    (b) Evaluation personnel. For a child with a disability who has been 
evaluated for the first time, the public agency shall ensure--
    (1) That a member of the evaluation team participates in the 
meeting; or
    (2) That the representative of the public agency, the child's 
teacher, or some other person is present at the meeting, who is 
knowledgeable about the evaluation procedures used with the child and is 
familiar with the results of the evaluation.
    (c) Transition services participants. (1) If a purpose of the 
meeting is the consideration of transition services for a student, the 
public agency shall invite--
    (i) The student; and
    (ii) A representative of any other agency that is likely to be 
responsible for providing or paying for transition services.
    (2) If the student does not attend, the public agency shall take 
other steps to ensure that the student's preferences and interests are 
considered; and
    (3) If an agency invited to send a representative to a meeting does 
not do so, the public agency shall take other steps to obtain the 
participation of the other agency in the planning of any transition 
services.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1401 (a)(19), (a)(20); 1412(2)(B), (4), (6); 
1414(a)(5))

    Note 1: In deciding which teacher will participate in meetings on a 
child's IEP, the agency may wish to consider the following 
possibilities:
    (a) For a child with a disability who is receiving special 
education, the teacher could be the child's special education teacher. 
If the child's disability is a speech impairment, the teacher could be 
the speech-language pathologist.
    (b) For a child with a disability who is being considered for 
placement in special education, the teacher could be the child's regular 
teacher, or a teacher qualified to provide education in the type of 
program in which the child may be placed, or both.
    (c) If the child is not in school or has more than one teacher, the 
agency may designate which teacher will participate in the meeting.

    Either the teacher or the agency representative should be qualified 
in the area of the child's suspected disability.
    For a child whose primary disability is a speech or language 
impairment, the evaluation personnel participating under paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section would normally be the speech-language 
pathologist.


    Note 2: Under paragraph (c), the public agency is required to invite 
each student to participate in his or her IEP meeting, if a purpose of 
the meeting is the consideration of transition services for the student. 
For all students who are 16 years of age or older, one of the purposes 
of the annual meeting will always be the planning of transition 
services, since transition services are a required component of the IEP 
for these students.

    For a student younger than age 16, if transition services are 
initially discussed at a meeting that does not include the student, the 
public agency is responsible for ensuring that, before a decision about 
transition services for the student is made, a subsequent IEP meeting is 
conducted for that purpose, and the student is invited to the meeting.

    13. Who can serve as the representative of the public agency at an 
IEP meeting?
    The representative of the public agency could be any member of the 
school staff, other than the child's teacher, who is qualified to 
provide, or supervise the provision of, specially designed instruction 
to meet the unique needs of children with disabilities. (Section 
602(a)(20) of the Act.) Thus, the agency representative could be (1) a 
qualified special education administrator, supervisor, or teacher 
(including a speech-language pathologist), or (2) a school principal or 
other administrator--if the person is qualified to provide, or supervise 
the provision of, special education.
    Each State or local agency may determine which specific staff member 
will serve as the agency representative. However, the representative 
should be able to ensure that whatever services are set out in the IEP 
will actually be provided and that the IEP will not be vetoed at a 
higher administrative

[[Page 80]]

level within the agency. Thus, the person selected should have the 
authority to commit agency resources (i.e., to make decisions about the 
specific special education and related services that the agency will 
provide to a particular child).
    For a child with a disability who requires only a limited amount of 
special education, the agency representative able to commit appropriate 
resources could be a special education teacher, or a speech-language 
pathologist, other than the child's teacher. For a child who requires 
extensive special education and related services, the agency 
representative might need to be a key administrator in the agency.

    Note: IEP meetings for continuing placements could be more routine 
than those for initial placements, and, thus, might not require the 
participation of a key administrator.

    14. Who is the representative of the public agency if a child with a 
disability is served by a public agency other than the SEA or LEA?
    The answer depends on which agency is responsible, under State law, 
policy, or practice, for any one or all of the following:
    (1) The child's education, (2) placing the child, and (3) providing 
(or paying for the provision of) special education and related services 
to the child.
    In general, the agency representative at the IEP meeting would be a 
member of the agency or institution that is responsible for the child's 
education. For example, if a State agency (1) places a child in an 
institution, (2) is responsible under State law for the child's 
education, and (3) has a qualified special education staff at the 
institution, then a member of the institution's staff would be the 
agency representative at the IEP meetings.
    Sometimes there is no special education staff at the institution, 
and the children are served by special education personnel from the LEA 
where the institution is located. In this situation, a member of the LEA 
staff would usually serve as the agency representative.

    Note: In situations where the LEA places a child in an institution, 
paragraph ``b'' of the response to Question 1, above, would apply.

    15. For a child with a disability being considered for initial 
placement in special education, which teacher should attend the IEP 
meeting?
    The teacher could be either (1) a teacher qualified to provide 
special education in the child's area of suspected disability, or (2) 
the child's regular teacher. At the option of the agency, both teachers 
could attend. In any event, there should be at least one member of the 
school staff at the meeting (e.g., the agency representative or the 
teacher) who is qualified in the child's area of suspected disability.

    Note: Sometimes more than one meeting is necessary in order to 
finalize a child's IEP. If, in this process, the special education 
teacher who will be working with the child is identified, it would be 
useful to have that teacher participate in the meeting with the parents 
and other members of the IEP team in finalizing the IEP. When this is 
not possible, the agency should ensure that the teacher is given a copy 
of the child's IEP as soon as possible after the IEP is finalized and 
before the teacher begins working with the child.

    16. If a child with a disability is enrolled in both regular and 
special education classes, which teacher should attend the IEP meeting?
    In general, the teacher at the IEP meeting should be the child's 
special education teacher. At the option of the agency or the parent, 
the child's regular teacher also might attend. If the regular teacher 
does not attend, the agency should either provide the regular teacher 
with a copy of the IEP or inform the regular teacher of its contents. 
Moreover, the agency should ensure that the special education teacher, 
or other appropriate support person, is able, as necessary, to consult 
with and be a resource to the child's regular teacher.
    17. If a child with a disability in high school attends several 
regular classes, must all of the child's regular teachers attend the IEP 
meeting?
    No. Only one teacher must attend. However, at the option of the LEA, 
additional teachers of the child may attend. The following points should 
be considered in making this decision:
    a. Generally, the number of participants at IEP meetings should be 
small. Small meetings have several advantages over large ones. For 
example, they (1) allow for more open, active parent involvement, (2) 
are less costly, (3) are easier to arrange and conduct, and (4) are 
usually more productive.
    b. While large meetings are generally inappropriate, there may be 
specific circumstances where the participation of additional staff would 
be beneficial. When the participation of the regular teachers is 
considered by the agency or the parents to be beneficial to the child's 
success in school (e.g., in terms of the child's participation in the 
regular education program), it would be appropriate for them to attend 
the meeting.
    c. Although the child's regular teachers would not routinely attend 
IEP meetings, they should either (1) be informed about the child's IEP 
by the special education teacher or agency representative, and/or (2) 
receive a copy of the IEP itself.
    18. If a child's primary disability is a speech impairment, must the 
child's regular teacher attend the IEP meeting?

[[Page 81]]

    No. A speech-language pathologist would usually serve as the child's 
teacher for purposes of the IEP meeting. The regular teacher could also 
attend at the option of the school.
    19. If a child is enrolled in a special education class because of a 
primary disability, and also receives speech-language pathology 
services, must both specialists attend the IEP meeting?
    No. It is not required that both attend. The special education 
teacher would attend the meeting as the child's teacher. The speech-
language pathologist could either (1) participate in the meeting itself, 
or (2) provide a written recommendation concerning the nature, 
frequency, and amount of services to be provided to the child.
    20. When may representatives of teacher organizations attend IEP 
meetings?
    Under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (``FERPA''; 20 
U.S.C. 1232g) and implementing regulations (34 CFR part 99) and the 
confidentiality requirements of part B, officials of teacher 
organizations may not attend IEP meetings if personally identifiable 
information from the student's education records is discussed--except 
with the prior written consent of the parents. (See 34 CFR 99.30(a) and 
300.571(a)(1).)
    In addition, part B does not provide for the participation of 
representatives of teacher organizations at IEP meetings. The 
legislative history of the Act makes it clear that attendance at IEP 
meetings should be limited to those who have an intense interest in the 
child. (121 Cong. Rec. S10974 (June 18, 1975) (remarks of Sen. 
Randolph).) Since a representative of a teacher organization would be 
concerned with the interests of the teacher rather than the interests of 
the child, it would be inappropriate for such an official to attend an 
IEP meeting.
    21. When may a child with a disability attend an IEP meeting?
    Generally, a child with a disability should attend the IEP meeting 
whenever the parent decides that it is appropriate for the child to do 
so. Whenever possible, the agency and parents should discuss the 
appropriateness of the child's participation before a decision is made, 
in order to help the parents determine whether or not the child's 
attendance will be (1) helpful in developing the IEP and/or (2) directly 
beneficial to the child. The agency should inform the parents before 
each IEP meeting--as part of the notice of meeting required under 
Sec. 300.345(b)--that they may invite their child to participate.

    Note: The parents and agency should encourage older children with 
disabilities (particularly those at the secondary school level) to 
participate in their IEP meetings.

    22. Do the parents of a student with a disability retain the right 
to attend the IEP meeting when the student reaches the age of majority?
    The Act is silent concerning any modification of the rights of the 
parents of a student with a disability when the student reaches the age 
of majority.
    23. Must related services personnel attend IEP meetings?
    No. It is not required that they attend. However, if a child with a 
disability has an identified need for related services, it would be 
appropriate for the related services personnel to attend the meeting or 
otherwise be involved in developing the IEP. For example, when the 
child's evaluation indicates the need for a specific related service 
(e.g., physical therapy, occupational therapy, or counseling), the 
agency should ensure that a qualified provider of that service either 
(1) attends the IEP meeting, or (2) provides a written recommendation 
concerning the nature, frequency, and amount of service to be provided 
to the child.

    Note: This written recommendation could be a part of the evaluation 
report.

    24. Are agencies required to use a case manager in the development 
of the IEP of a child with a disability?
    No. However, some agencies have found it helpful to have a special 
educator or some other school staff member (e.g., a social worker, 
counselor, or psychologist) serve as coordinator or case manager of the 
IEP process for an individual child or for all children with 
disabilities served by the agency. Examples of the kinds of activities 
that case managers might carry out are (1) coordinating the 
multidisciplinary evaluation; (2) collecting and synthesizing the 
evaluation reports and other relevant information about a child that 
might be needed at the IEP meeting; (3) communicating with the parents; 
and (4) participating in, or conducting, the IEP meeting itself.
    25. For a child with a suspected speech impairment, who must 
represent the evaluation team at the IEP meeting?
    No specific person must represent the evaluation team. However, a 
speech-language pathologist would normally be the most appropriate 
representative. For many children whose primary disability is a speech 
impairment, there may be no other evaluation personnel involved. The 
note following Sec. 300.532 (Evaluation procedures) states:
    Children who have a speech impairment as their primary disability 
may not need a complete battery of assessments (e.g., psychological, 
physical, or adaptive behavior). However, a qualified speech-language 
pathologist would (1) evaluate each child with a speech impairment using 
procedures that are appropriate for the diagnosis and appraisal of 
speech and language impairments, and (2) if

[[Page 82]]

necessary, make referrals for additional assessments needed to make an 
appropriate placement decision.

                   Sec. 300.345  Parent participation.

    (a) Each public agency shall take steps to ensure that one or both 
of the parents of the child with a disability are present at each 
meeting or are afforded the opportunity to participate, including--
    (1) Notifying parents of the meeting early enough to ensure that 
they will have an opportunity to attend; and
    (2) Scheduling the meeting at a mutually agreed on time and place.
    (b)(1) The notice under paragraph (a)(1) of this section must 
indicate the purpose, time, and location of the meeting and who will be 
in attendance;
    (2) If a purpose of the meeting is the consideration of transition 
services for a student, the notice must also--
    (i) Indicate this purpose;
    (ii) Indicate that the agency will invite the student; and
    (iii) Identify any other agency that will be invited to send a 
representative.
    (c) If neither parent can attend, the public agency shall use other 
methods to ensure parent participation, including individual or 
conference telephone calls.
    (d) A meeting may be conducted without a parent in attendance if the 
public agency is unable to convince the parents that they should attend. 
In this case the public agency must have a record of its attempts to 
arrange a mutually agreed on time and place such as--
    (1) Detailed records of telephone calls made or attempted and the 
results of those calls;
    (2) Copies of correspondence sent to the parents and any responses 
received; and
    (3) Detailed records of visits made to the parent's home or place of 
employment and the results of those visits.
    (e) The public agency shall take whatever action is necessary to 
ensure that the parent understands the proceedings at a meeting, 
including arranging for an interpreter for parents with deafness or 
whose native language is other than English.
    (f) The public agency shall give the parent, on request, a copy of 
the IEP.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1401(a)(20); 1412 (2)(B), (4), (6); 1414(a)(5))

    Note: The notice in paragraph (a) of this section could also inform 
parents that they may bring other people to the meeting. As indicated in 
paragraph (c) of this section, the procedure used to notify parents 
(whether oral or written or both) is left to the discretion of the 
agency, but the agency must keep a record of its efforts to contact 
parents.

    26. What is the role of the parents at an IEP meeting? The parents 
of a child with a disability are expected to be equal participants along 
with school personnel, in developing, reviewing, and revising the 
child's IEP. This is an active role in which the parents (1) participate 
in the discussion about the child's need for special education and 
related services, and (2) join with the other participants in deciding 
what services the agency will provide to the child.

    Note: In some instances, parents might elect to bring another 
participant to the meeting, e.g., a friend or neighbor, someone outside 
of the agency who is familiar with applicable laws and with the child's 
needs, or a specialist who conducted an independent evaluation of the 
child.

    27. What is the role of a surrogate parent at an IEP meeting?
    A surrogate parent is a person appointed to represent the interests 
of a child with a disability in the educational decision-making process 
when that child has no other parent representation. The surrogate has 
all of the rights and responsibilities of a parent under part B. Thus, 
the surrogate parent is entitled to (1) participate in the child's IEP 
meeting, (2) see the child's education records, and (3) receive notice, 
grant consent, and invoke due process to resolve differences. (See 
Sec. 300.514, Surrogate parents.)
    28. Must the public agency let the parents know who will be at the 
IEP meeting?
    Yes. In notifying parents about the meeting, the agency ``must 
indicate the purpose, time, and location of the meeting, and who will be 
in attendance.'' (Sec. 300.345(b), emphasis added.) If possible, the 
agency should give the name and position of each person who will attend. 
In addition, the agency should inform the parents of their right to 
bring other participants to the meeting. (See Question 21, above, 
regarding participation of the child.) It is also appropriate for the 
agency to ask whether the parents intend to bring a participant to the 
meeting.
    29. Are parents required to sign IEPs? Parent signatures are not 
required by either the Act or regulations. However, having such 
signatures is considered by parents, advocates, and public agency 
personnel to be useful.
    The following are some of the ways that IEPs signed by parents and/
or agency personnel might be used:
    a. A signed IEP is one way to document who attended the meeting.

    Note: This is useful for monitoring and compliance purposes.

    If signatures are not used, the agency must document attendance in 
some other way.
    b. An IEP signed by the parents is one way to indicate that the 
parents approved the child's special education program.

    Note: If, after signing, the parents feel that a change is needed in 
the IEP, it would

[[Page 83]]

be appropriate for them to request another meeting. See Question 11, 
above.

    c. An IEP signed by an agency representative provides the parents a 
signed record of the services that the agency has agreed to provide.

    Note: Even if the school personnel do not sign, the agency still 
must provide, or ensure the provision of, the services called for in the 
IEP.

    30. If the parent signs the IEP, does the signature indicate consent 
for initial placement?
    The parent's signature on the IEP would satisfy the consent 
requirement concerning initial placement of the child 
(Sec. 300.504(b)(1)(ii)) only if the IEP includes a statement on initial 
placement that meets the definition of consent in Sec. 300.500:
    Consent means that: (a) the parent has been fully informed of all 
information relevant to the activity for which consent is sought * * *
    (b) The parent understands and agrees in writing to the carrying out 
of the activity for which his or her consent is sought, and the consent 
describes that activity and lists the records (if any) that will be 
released and to whom; and
    (c) The parent understands that the granting of consent is voluntary 
* * * and may be revoked at any time.
    31. Do parents have the right to a copy of their child's IEP?
    Yes. Section 300.345(f) states that the public agency shall give the 
parent, on request, a copy of the IEP. In order that parents may know 
about this provision, it is recommended that they be informed about it 
at the IEP meeting and/or receive a copy of the IEP itself within a 
reasonable time following the meeting.
    32. Must parents be informed at the IEP meeting of their right to 
appeal?
    If the agency has already informed the parents of their right to 
appeal, as it is required to do under the prior notice provisions of the 
regulations (Secs. 300.504-300.505), it would not be necessary for the 
agency to do so again at the IEP meeting.
    Section 300.504(a) of the regulations states that ``written notice 
that meets the requirements under Sec. 300.505 must be given to parents 
a reasonable time'' before the public agency proposes or refuses ``to 
initiate or change the identification, evaluation, or educational 
placement of the child or the provision of FAPE to the child.''
    Section 300.505(a) states that the notice must include ``(1) A full 
explanation of all of the procedural safeguards available to the parents 
under Sec. 300.500, Secs. 300.502-300.515, and Secs. 300.562-300.569.''
    The IEP meeting serves as a communication vehicle between parents 
and school personnel, and enables them, as equal participants, to 
jointly decide upon what the child's needs are, what will be provided, 
and what the anticipated outcomes may be. If, during the IEP meeting, 
parents and school staff are unable to reach agreement, the agency 
should remind the parents that they may seek to resolve their 
differences through the due process procedures under the Act.

    Note: Section 300.506(a) states that ``a parent or public 
educational agency may initiate a hearing on any matters described in 
Sec. 300.504(a) (1) and (2).''

    Every effort should be made to resolve differences between parents 
and school staff without resort to a due process hearing (i.e., through 
voluntary mediation or some other informal step). However, mediation or 
other informal procedures may not be used to deny or delay a parent's 
right to a due process hearing. (See Sec. 300.506. Impartial due process 
hearing.)
    33. Does the IEP include ways for parents to check the progress of 
their children?
    In general, the answer is yes. The IEP document is a written record 
of decisions jointly made by parents and school personnel at the IEP 
meeting regarding the special education program of a child with a 
disability. That record includes agreed upon items, such as goals and 
objectives, and the specific special education and related services to 
be provided to the child.
    The goals and objectives in the IEP should be helpful to both 
parents and school personnel, in a general way, in checking on a child's 
progress in the special education program. (See Questions 37-43, below, 
regarding goals and objectives in the IEP.) However, since the IEP is 
not intended to include the specifics about a child's total educational 
program that are found in daily, weekly, or monthly instructional plans, 
parents will often need to obtain more specific, on-going information 
about the child's progress--through parent-teacher conferences, report 
cards and other reporting procedures ordinarily used by the agency.
    34. Must IEPs include specific checkpoint intervals for parents to 
confer with teachers and to revise or update their children's IEPs?
    No. The IEP of a child with a disability is not required to include 
specific ``checkpoint intervals'' (i.e., meeting dates) for reviewing 
the child's progress. However, in individual situations, specific 
meeting dates could be designated in the IEP, if the parents and school 
personnel believe that it would be helpful to do so.
    Although meeting dates are not required to be set out in the IEP 
itself, there are specific provisions in the regulations and in this 
document regarding agency responsibilities in initiating IEP meetings, 
including the following:

[[Page 84]]

    (1) Public agencies must hold meetings periodically, but not less 
than annually, to review, and if appropriate, revise, each child's IEP 
(Sec. 300.343(d)); (2) there should be as many meetings a year as the 
child needs (see Question 10, above); and (3) agencies should grant any 
reasonable parental request for an IEP meeting (see Question 11, above).
    In addition to the above provisions, it is expected that, through an 
agency's general reporting procedures for all children in school, there 
will be specific designated times for parents to review their children's 
progress (e.g., through periodic parent-teacher conferences, and/or the 
use of report cards, letters, or other reporting devices).
    35. If the parents and agency are unable to reach agreement at an 
IEP meeting, what steps should be followed until agreement is reached?
    As a general rule, the agency and parents would agree to an interim 
course of action for serving the child (i.e., in terms of placement and/
or services) to be followed until the area of disagreement over the IEP 
is resolved. The manner in which this interim measure is developed and 
agreed to by both parties is left to the discretion of the individual 
State or local agency. However, if the parents and agency cannot agree 
on an interim measure, the child's last agreed upon IEP would remain in 
effect in the areas of disagreement until the disagreement is resolved. 
The following may be helpful to agencies if there are disagreements:
    a. There may be instances where the parents and agency are in 
agreement about the basic IEP services (e.g., the child's placement and/
or the special education services), but disagree about the provision of 
a particular related service (i.e., whether the service is needed and/or 
the amount to be provided). In such cases, it is recommended (1) that 
the IEP be implemented in all areas where there is agreement, (2) that 
the document indicate the points of disagreement, and (3) that 
procedures be initiated to resolve the disagreement.
    b. Sometimes the disagreement is with the placement or kind of 
special education to be provided (e.g., one party proposes a self-
contained placement, and the other proposes resource room services). In 
such cases, the agency might, for example, carry out any one or all of 
the following steps:
    (1) Remind the parents that they may resolve their differences 
through the due process procedures under part B; (2) work with the 
parents to develop an interim course of action (in terms of placement 
and/or services) that both parties can agree to until resolution is 
reached; and (3) recommend the use of mediation, or some other informal 
procedure for resolving the differences without going to a due process 
hearing. (See Question 32, above, regarding the right to appeal.)
    c. If, because of the disagreement over the IEP, a hearing is 
initiated by either the parents or agency, the agency may not change the 
child's placement unless the parents and agency agree otherwise. (See 
Sec. 300.513, Child's status during proceedings.) The following two 
examples are related to this requirement:
    (1) A child in the regular fourth grade has been evaluated and found 
to be eligible for special education. The agency and parents agree that 
the child has a specific learning disability. However, one party 
proposes placement in a self-contained program, and the other proposes 
placement in a resource room. Agreement cannot be reached, and a due 
process hearing is initiated. Unless the parents and agency agree 
otherwise, the child would remain in the regular fourth grade until the 
issue is resolved.
    On the other hand, since the child's need for special education is 
not in question, both parties might agree--as an interim measure--(1) to 
temporarily place the child in either one of the programs proposed at 
the meeting (self-contained program or resource room), or (2) to serve 
the child through some other temporary arrangement.
    (2) A child with a disability is currently receiving special 
education under an existing IEP. A due process hearing has been 
initiated regarding an alternative special education placement for the 
child. Unless the parents and agency agree otherwise, the child would 
remain in the current placement. In this situation, the child's IEP 
could be revised, as necessary, and implemented in all of the areas 
agreed to by the parents and agency, while the area of disagreement 
(i.e., the child's placement) is being settled through due process.

    Note: If the due process hearing concerns whether or not a 
particular service should continue to be provided under the IEP (e.g., 
physical therapy), that service would continue to be provided to the 
child under the IEP that was in effect at the time the hearing was 
initiated, (1) unless the parents and agency agree to a change in the 
services, or (2) until the issue is resolved.

       Sec. 300.346  Content of individualized education program.

    (a) General. The IEP for each child must include--
    (1) A statement of the child's present levels of educational 
performance;
    (2) A statement of annual goals, including short-term instructional 
objectives;
    (3) A statement of the specific special education and related 
services to be provided to the child and the extent that the child will 
be able to participate in regular educational programs;

[[Page 85]]

    (4) The projected dates for initiation of services and the 
anticipated duration of the services; and
    (5) Appropriate objective criteria and evaluation procedures and 
schedules for determining, on at least an annual basis, whether the 
short term instructional objectives are being achieved.
    (b) Transition services. (1) The IEP for each student, beginning no 
later than age 16 (and at a younger age, if determined appropriate), 
must include a statement of the needed transition services as defined in 
Sec. 300.18, including, if appropriate, a statement of each public 
agency's and each participating agency's responsibilities or linkages, 
or both, before the student leaves the school setting.
    (2) If the IEP team determines that services are not needed in one 
or more of the areas specified in Sec. 300.18(b)(2)(i) through 
(b)(2)(iii), the IEP must include a statement to that effect and the 
basis upon which the determination was made.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1401(a)(19), (a)(20); 1412(2)(B), (4), (6); 
1414(a)(5))

    Note 1: The legislative history of the transition services 
provisions of the Act suggests that the statement of needed transition 
services referred to in paragraph (b) of this section should include a 
commitment by any participating agency to meet any financial 
responsibility it may have in the provision of transition services. See 
House Report No. 101-544, p. 11 (1990).


    Note 2: With respect to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this 
section, it is generally expected that the statement of needed 
transition services will include the areas listed in 
Sec. 300.18(b)(2)(i) through (b)(2)(iii). If the IEP team determines 
that services are not needed in one of those areas, the public agency 
must implement the requirements in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. 
Since it is a part of the IEP, the IEP team must reconsider its 
determination at least annually.


    Note 3: Section 602(a)(20) of the Act provides that IEPs must 
include a statement of needed transition services for students beginning 
no later than age 16, but permits transition services to students below 
age 16 (i.e., ``* * * and, when determined appropriate for the 
individual, beginning at age 14 or younger.''). Although the statute 
does not mandate transition services for all students beginning at age 
14 or younger, the provision of these services could have a 
significantly positive effect on the employment and independent living 
outcomes for many of these students in the future, especially for 
students who are likely to drop out before age 16. With respect to the 
provision of transition services to students below age 16, the Report of 
the House Committee on Education and Labor on Pub. L. 101-476 includes 
the following statement:
Although this language leaves the final determination of when to 
initiate transition services for students under age 16 to the IEP 
process, it nevertheless makes clear that Congress expects consideration 
to be given to the need for transition services for some students by age 
14 or younger. The Committee encourages that approach because of their 
concern that age 16 may be too late for many students, particularly 
those at risk of dropping out of school and those with the most severe 
disabilities. Even for those students who stay in school until age 18, 
many will need more than two years of transitional services. Students 
with disabilities are now dropping out of school before age 16, feeling 
that the education system has little to offer them. Initiating services 
at a younger age will be critical. (House Report No. 101-544, 10 
(1990).)

    36. What should be included in the statement of the child's present 
levels of educational performance?
    The statement of present levels of educational performance will be 
different for each child with a disability. Thus, determinations about 
the content of the statement for an individual child are matters that 
are left to the discretion of participants in the IEP meetings. However, 
the following are some points that should be taken into account in 
writing this part of the IEP:
    a. The statement should accurately describe the effect of the 
child's disability on the child's performance in any area of education 
that is affected, including (1) academic areas (reading, math, 
communication, etc.), and (2) non-academic areas (daily life activities, 
mobility, etc.).

    Note: Labels such as mental retardation or deafness may not be used 
as a substitute for the description of present levels of educational 
performance.

    b. The statement should be written in objective measurable terms, to 
the extent possible. Data from the child's evaluation would be a good 
source of such information. Test scores that are pertinent to the 
child's diagnosis might be included, if appropriate. However, the scores 
should be (1) self-explanatory (i.e., they can be interpreted by all 
participants without the use of test manuals or other aids), or (2) an 
explanation should be included. Whatever test results are used should 
reflect the impact of the disability on the child's performance. Thus, 
raw scores would not usually be sufficient.
    c. There should be a direct relationship between the present levels 
of educational performance and the other components of the IEP. Thus, if 
the statement describes a problem with the child's reading level and 
points to a deficiency in a specific reading skill, this problem should 
be addressed under both

[[Page 86]]

(1) goals and objectives, and (2) specific special education and related 
services to be provided to the child.
    37. Why are goals and objectives required in the IEP?
    The statutory requirements for including annual goals and short term 
instructional objectives (section 602(a)(20)(B)), and for having at 
least an annual review of the IEP of a child with a disability (section 
614(a)(5)) provide a mechanism for determining (1) whether the 
anticipated outcomes for the child are being met (i.e., whether the 
child is progressing in the special education program) and (2) whether 
the placement and services are appropriate to the child's special 
learning needs. In effect, these requirements provide a way for the 
child's teacher(s) and parents to be able to track the child's progress 
in special education. However, the goals and objectives in the IEP are 
not intended to be as specific as the goals and objectives that are 
normally found in daily, weekly, or monthly instructional plans.
    38. What are annual goals in an IEP?
    The annual goals in the IEP are statements that describe what a 
child with a disability can reasonably be expected to accomplish within 
a twelve month period in the child's special education program. As 
indicated under Question 36, above, there should be a direct 
relationship between the annual goals and the present levels of 
educational performance.
    39. What are short term instructional objectives in an IEP?
    Short term instructional objectives (also called IEP objectives) are 
measurable, intermediate steps between the present levels of educational 
performance of a child with a disability and the annual goals that are 
established for the child. The objectives are developed based on a 
logical breakdown of the major components of the annual goals, and can 
serve as milestones for measuring progress toward meeting the goals.
    In some respects, IEP objectives are similar to objectives used in 
daily classroom instructional plans. For example, both kinds of 
objectives are used (1) to describe what a given child is expected to 
accomplish in a particular area within some specified time period, and 
(2) to determine the extent that the child is progressing toward those 
accomplishments.
    In other respects, objectives in IEPs are different from those used 
in instructional plans, primarily in the amount of detail they provide. 
IEP objectives provide general benchmarks for determining progress 
toward meeting the annual goals. These objectives should be projected to 
be accomplished over an extended period of time (e.g., an entire school 
quarter or semester). On the other hand, the objectives in classroom 
instructional plans deal with more specific outcomes that are to be 
accomplished on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. Classroom 
instructional plans generally include details not required in an IEP, 
such as the specific methods, activities, and materials (e.g., use of 
flash cards) that will be used in accomplishing the objectives.
    40. Should the IEP goals and objectives focus only on special 
education and related services, or should they relate to the total 
education of the child?
    IEP goals and objectives are concerned primarily with meeting the 
needs of a child with a disability for special education and related 
services, and are not required to cover other areas of the child's 
education. Stated another way, the goals and objectives in the IEP 
should focus on offsetting or reducing the problems resulting from the 
child's disability that interfere with learning and educational 
performance in school. For example, if a child with a learning 
disability is functioning several grades below the child's indicated 
ability in reading and has a specific problem with word recognition, the 
IEP goals and objectives would be directed toward (1) closing the gap 
between the child's indicated ability and current level of functioning, 
and (2) helping the child increase the ability to use word attack skills 
effectively (or to find some other approach to increase independence in 
reading).
    For a child with a mild speech impairment, the IEP objectives would 
focus on improving the child's communication skills, by either (1) 
correcting the impairment, or (2) minimizing its effect on the child's 
ability to communicate. On the other hand, the goals and objectives for 
a child with severe mental retardation would be more comprehensive and 
cover more of the child's school program than if the child has only a 
mild disability.
    41. Should there be a relationship between the goals and objectives 
in the IEP and those that are in instructional plans of special 
education personnel?
    Yes. There should be a direct relationship between the IEP goals and 
objectives for a given child with a disability and the goals and 
objectives that are in the special education instructional plans for the 
child. However, the IEP is not intended to be detailed enough to be used 
as an instructional plan. The IEP, through its goals and objectives, (1) 
sets the general direction to be taken by those who will implement the 
IEP, and (2) serves as the basis for developing a detailed instructional 
plan for the child.

    Note: See Question 56, below, regarding the length of IEPs.

    42. When must IEP objectives be written--before placement or after 
placement?
    IEP objectives must be written before placement. Once a child with a 
disability is placed in a special education program, the teacher might 
develop lesson plans or more

[[Page 87]]

detailed objectives based on the IEP; however, such plans and objectives 
are not required to be a part of the IEP itself.
    43. Can short term instructional objectives be changed without 
initiating another IEP meeting?
    No. Section 300.343(a) provides that the agency ``is responsible for 
initiating and conducting meetings for the purpose of developing, 
reviewing, and revising the IEP of a child with a disability'' (emphasis 
added). Since a change in short term instructional objectives 
constitutes a revision of the child's IEP, the agency must (1) notify 
the parents of the proposed change (see Sec. 300.504(a)(1)), and (2) 
initiate an IEP meeting. Note, however, that if the parents are unable 
or unwilling to attend such a meeting, their participation in the 
revision of the IEP objectives can be obtained through other means, 
including individual or conference telephone calls (see 
Sec. 300.345(c)).
    44. Must the IEP include all special education and related services 
needed by the child or only those available from the public agency?
    Each public agency must provide FAPE to all children with 
disabilities under its jurisdiction. Therefore, the IEP for a child with 
a disability must include all of the specific special education and 
related services needed by the child--as determined by the child's 
current evaluation. This means that the services must be listed in the 
IEP even if they are not directly available from the local agency, and 
must be provided by the agency through contract or other arrangements.
    45. Is the IEP a commitment to provide services--i.e., must a public 
agency provide all of the services listed in the IEP?
    Yes. The IEP of each child with a disability must include all 
services necessary to meet the child's identified special education and 
related services needs; and all services in the IEP must be provided in 
order for the agency to be in compliance with the Act.
    46. Must the public agency itself directly provide the services set 
out in the IEP?
    The public agency responsible for the education of a child with a 
disability could provide IEP services to the child (1) directly, through 
the agency's own staff resources, or (2) indirectly, by contracting with 
another public or private agency, or through other arrangements. In 
providing the services, the agency may use whatever State, local, 
Federal, and private sources of support are available for those purposes 
(see Sec. 300.301(a)). However, the services must be at no cost to the 
parents, and responsibility for ensuring that the IEP services are 
provided remains with the public agency.
    47. Does the IEP include only special education and related services 
or does it describe the total education of the child?
    The IEP is required to include only those matters concerning the 
provision of special education and related services and the extent that 
the child can participate in regular education programs. (Note: The 
regulations define special education as specially designed instruction 
to meet the unique needs of a child with a disability, and related 
services as those services that are necessary to assist the child to 
benefit from special education.) (See Secs. 300.17 and 300.16, 
respectively.)
    For some children with disabilities, the IEP will only address a 
very limited part of their education (e.g., for a child with a speech 
impairment, the IEP would generally be limited to the child's speech 
impairment). For other children (e.g., those with profound mental 
retardation), the IEP might cover their total education. An IEP for a 
child with a physical disability with no mental or emotional disability 
might consist only of specially designed physical education. However, if 
the child also has a mental or emotional disability, the IEP might cover 
most of the child's education.

    Note: The IEP is not intended to be detailed enough to be used as an 
instructional plan. See Question 41, above.

    48. If modifications are necessary for a child with a disability to 
participate in a regular education program, must they be included in the 
IEP?
    Yes. If modifications (supplementary aids and services) to the 
regular education program are necessary to ensure the child's 
participation in that program, those modifications must be described in 
the child's IEP (e.g., for a child with a hearing impairment, special 
seating arrangements or the provision of assignments in writing). This 
applies to any regular education program in which the student may 
participate, including physical education, art, music, and vocational 
education.
    49. When must physical education (PE) be described or referred to in 
the IEP?
    Section 300.307(a) provides that physical education services, 
specially designed if necessary, must be made available to every child 
with a disability receiving FAPE. The following paragraphs (1) set out 
some of the different PE program arrangements for students with 
disabilities, and (2) indicate whether, and to what extent, PE must be 
described or referred to in an IEP:
    a. Regular PE with nondisabled students. If a student with a 
disability can participate fully in the regular PE program without any 
special modifications to compensate for the student's disability, it 
would not be necessary to describe or refer to PE in the IEP. On the 
other hand, if some modifications to the regular PE program are 
necessary for the

[[Page 88]]

student to be able to participate in that program, those modifications 
must be described in the IEP.
    b. Specially designed PE. If a student with a disability needs a 
specially designed PE program, that program must be addressed in all 
applicable areas of the IEP (e.g., present levels of educational 
performance, goals and objectives, and services to be provided). 
However, these statements would not have to be presented in any more 
detail than the other special education services included in the 
student's IEP.
    c. PE in separate facilities. If a student with a disability is 
educated in a separate facility, the PE program for that student must be 
described or referred to in the IEP. However, the kind and amount of 
information to be included in the IEP would depend on the physical-motor 
needs of the student and the type of PE program that is to be provided.
    Thus, if a student is in a separate facility that has a standard PE 
program (e.g., a residential school for students with deafness), and if 
it is determined--on the basis of the student's most recent evaluation--
that the student is able to participate in that program without any 
modifications, then the IEP need only note such participation. On the 
other hand, if special modifications to the PE program are needed for 
the student to participate, those modifications must be described in the 
IEP. Moreover, if the student needs an individually designed PE program, 
that program must be addressed under all applicable parts of the IEP. 
(See paragraph ``b'', above.)
    50. If a student with a disability is to receive vocational 
education, must it be described or referred to in the student's IEP?
    The answer depends on the kind of vocational education program to be 
provided. If a student with a disability is able to participate in the 
regular vocational education program without any modifications to 
compensate for the student's disability, it would not be necessary to 
include vocational education in the student's IEP. On the other hand, if 
modifications to the regular vocational education program are necessary 
in order for the student to participate in that program, those 
modifications must be included in the IEP. Moreover, if the student 
needs a specially designed vocational education program, then vocational 
education must be described in all applicable areas of the student's IEP 
(e.g., present levels of educational performance, goals and objectives, 
and specific services to be provided). However, these statements would 
not have to be presented in any more detail than the other special 
education services included in the IEP.
    51. Must the IEP specify the amount of services or may it simply 
list the services to be provided?
    The amount of services to be provided must be stated in the IEP, so 
that the level of the agency's commitment of resources will be clear to 
parents and other IEP team members. The amount of time to be committed 
to each of the various services to be provided must be (1) appropriate 
to that specific service, and (2) stated in the IEP in a manner that is 
clear to all who are involved in both the development and implementation 
of the IEP.
    Changes in the amount of services listed in the IEP cannot be made 
without holding another IEP meeting. However, as long as there is no 
change in the overall amount, some adjustments in scheduling the 
services should be possible (based on the professional judgment of the 
service provider) without holding another IEP meeting.

    Note: The parents should be notified whenever this occurs.

    52. Must the IEP of a child with a disability indicate the extent 
that the child will be educated in the regular educational program?
    Yes. Section 300.346(a)(3) provides that the IEP for each child with 
a disability must include a ``statement of * * * the extent that the 
child will be able to participate in regular educational programs.'' One 
way of meeting this requirement is to indicate the percent of time the 
child will be spending in the regular education program with nondisabled 
students. Another way is to list the specific regular education classes 
the child will be attending.

    Note: If a child with a severe disability, for example, is expected 
to be in a special classroom setting most of the time, it is recommended 
that, in meeting the above requirement, the IEP include any non-
curricular activities in which the child will be participating with 
nondisabled students (e.g., lunch, assembly periods, club activities, 
and other special events).

    53. Can the anticipated duration of services be for more than twelve 
months?
    In general, the anticipated duration of services would be up to 
twelve months. There is a direct relationship between the anticipated 
duration of services and the other parts of the IEP (e.g., annual goals 
and short term instructional objectives), and each part of the IEP would 
be addressed whenever there is a review of the child's program. If it is 
anticipated that the child will need a particular service for more than 
one year, the duration of that service could be projected beyond that 
time in the IEP. However, the duration of each service must be 
reconsidered whenever the IEP is reviewed.
    54. Must the evaluation procedures and schedules be included as a 
separate item in the IEP?
    No. The evaluation procedures and schedules need not be included as 
a separate item

[[Page 89]]

in the IEP, but they must be presented in a recognizable form and be 
clearly linked to the short term instructional objectives.

    Note: In many instances, these components are incorporated directly 
into the objectives.


    Other Questions About the Content of an IEP
    55. Is it permissible for an agency to have the IEP completed when 
the IEP meeting begins?
    No. It is not permissible for an agency to present a completed IEP 
to parents for their approval before there has been a full discussion 
with the parents of (1) the child's need for special education and 
related services, and (2) what services the agency will provide to the 
child. Section 602(a)(20) of the Act defines the IEP as a written 
statement developed in any meeting with the agency representative, the 
teacher, the parent, and, if appropriate, the child.
    It would be appropriate for agency staff to come prepared with 
evaluation findings, statements of present levels of educational 
performance, and a recommendation regarding annual goals, short term 
instructional objectives, and the kind of special education and related 
services to be provided. However, the agency must make it clear to the 
parents at the outset of the meeting that the services proposed by the 
agency are only recommendations for review and discussion with the 
parents. The legislative history of Public Law 94-142 makes it clear 
that parents must be given the opportunity to be active participants in 
all major decisions affecting the education of their children with 
disabilities. (See, e.g., S. Rep. No. 168, 94th Cong. 1st Sess. 13 
(1975); S. Rep. No. 455 (Conference Report), 94th Cong. 1st Sess. 47-50 
(1975).)
    56. Is there a prescribed format or length for an IEP?
    No. The format and length of an IEP are matters left to the 
discretion of State and local agencies. The IEP should be as long as 
necessary to adequately describe a child's program. However, as 
indicated in Question 41, above, the IEP is not intended to be a 
detailed instructional plan. The Federal IEP requirements can usually be 
met in a one to three page form.
    57. Is it permissible to consolidate the IEP with an individualized 
service plan developed under another Federal program?
    Yes. In instances where a child with a disability must have both an 
IEP and an individualized service plan under another Federal program, it 
may be possible to develop a single, consolidated document only if: (1) 
It contains all of the information required in an IEP, and (2) all of 
the necessary parties participate in its development.
    Examples of individualized service plans that might be consolidated 
with the IEP are: (1) The Individualized Care Plan (title XIX of the 
Social Security Act (Medicaid)), (2) the Individualized Program Plan 
(title XX of the Social Security Act (Social Services)), (3) the 
Individualized Service Plan (title XVI of the Social Security Act 
(Supplemental Security Income)), and (4) the Individualized Written 
Rehabilitation Plan (Rehabilitation Act of 1973).
    58. What provisions on confidentiality of information apply to IEPs?
    IEPs are subject to the confidentiality provisions of both (1) part 
B (section 617(c) of the Act; Secs. 300.560-300.576 of the regulations), 
and (2) the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (``FERPA'', 20 
U.S.C. 1232g) and implementing regulations in 34 CFR part 99. An IEP is 
an education record as that term is used in the FERPA and implementing 
regulations (34 CFR Sec. 99.3) and is, therefore, subject to the same 
protections as other education records relating to the student.

    Note: Under Sec. 99.31(a) of the FERPA regulations, an educational 
agency may disclose personally identifiable information from the 
education records of a student without the written consent of the 
parents if ``(1) The disclosure is to other school officials, including 
teachers, within the agency or institution whom the agency or 
institution has determined to have legitimate educational interests * * 
*'' in that information.

       Sec. 300.348  Private school placements by public agencies.

    (a) Developing individualized education programs. (1) Before a 
public agency places a child with a disability in, or refers a child to, 
a private school or facility, the agency shall initiate and conduct a 
meeting to develop an IEP for the child in accordance with Sec. 300.343.
    (2) The agency shall ensure that a representative of the private 
school or facility attends the meeting. If the representative cannot 
attend, the agency shall use other methods to ensure participation by 
the private school or facility, including individual or conference 
telephone calls.
    (3) [Reserved]
    (b) Reviewing and revising individualized education programs. (1) 
After a child with a disability enters a private school or facility, any 
meetings to review and revise the child's IEP may be initiated and 
conducted by the private school or facility at the discretion of the 
public agency.
    (2) If the private school or facility initiates and conducts these 
meetings, the public agency shall ensure that the parents and an agency 
representative;
    (i) Are involved in any decision about the child's IEP; and
    (ii) Agree to any proposed changes in the program before those 
changes are implemented.

[[Page 90]]

    (c) Responsibility. Even if a private school or facility implements 
a child's IEP, responsibility for compliance with this part remains with 
the public agency and the SEA.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1413(a)(4)(B))

    59. If placement decisions are made at the time the IEP is 
developed, how can a private school representative attend the meeting?
    Generally, a child who requires placement in either a public or 
private residential school has already been receiving special education, 
and the parents and school personnel have often jointly been involved 
over a prolonged period of time in attempting to find the most 
appropriate placement for the child. At some point in this process 
(e.g., at a meeting where the child's current IEP is being reviewed), 
the possibility of residential school placement might be proposed--by 
either the parents or school personnel. If both agree, then the matter 
would be explored with the residential school. A subsequent meeting 
would then be conducted to finalize the IEP. At this meeting, the public 
agency must ensure that a representative of the residential school 
either (1) attends the meeting, or (2) participates through individual 
or conference telephone calls, or by other means.

 Sec. 300.349  Children with disabilities in parochial or other private 
                                schools.

    If a child with a disability is enrolled in a parochial or other 
private school and receives special education or related services from a 
public agency, the public agency shall--
    (a) Initiate and conduct meetings to develop, review, and revise an 
IEP for the child, in accordance with Sec. 300.343; and
    (b) Ensure that a representative of the parochial or other private 
school attends each meeting. If the representative cannot attend, the 
agency shall use other methods to ensure participation by the private 
school, including individual or conference telephone calls.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1413(a)(4)(A))

     Sec. 300.350  Individualized education program--accountability.

    Each public agency must provide special education and related 
services to a child with a disability in accordance with an IEP. 
However, part B of the Act does not require that any agency, teacher, or 
other person be held accountable if a child does not achieve the growth 
projected in the annual goals and objectives.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1412(2)(B); 1414(a)(5), (6); Cong. Rec. at H7152 
(daily ed., July 21, 1975))

    Note: This section is intended to relieve concerns that the IEP 
constitutes a guarantee by the public agency and the teacher that a 
child will progress at a specified rate. However, this section does not 
relieve agencies and teachers from making good faith efforts to assist 
the child in achieving the goals and objectives listed in the IEP. 
Further, the section does not limit a parent's right to complain and ask 
for revisions of the child's program, or to invoke due process 
procedures, if the parent feels that these efforts are not being made.

    60. Is the IEP a performance contract?
    No. Section 300.350 makes it clear that the IEP is not a performance 
contract that imposes liability on a teacher or public agency if a child 
with a disability does not meet the IEP objectives. While the agency 
must provide special education and related services in accordance with 
the IEP of each child with a disability, the Act does not require that 
the agency, the teacher, or other persons be held accountable if the 
child does not achieve the growth projected in the written statement.

amount allocated to the States for fiscal year 1997, each State is 
allocated the sum of--
    (1) The amount it received for fiscal year 1997; and
    (2) An amount that bears the same relation to any remaining funds as 
the increase the State received for the preceding fiscal year over 
fiscal year 1997 bears to the total of those increases for all States.
    (b)(1) If the amount available for allocations is equal to the 
amount allocated to the States for fiscal year 1997, each State is 
allocated the amount it received for that year.
    (2) If the amount available is less than the amount allocated to 
States for fiscal year 1997, the Secretary allocates amounts equal to 
the allocations for fiscal year 1997, ratably reduced.

    (a) Support services (including establishing and implementing the

      Subpart D--Allocation of funds to local educational agencies.


<R05>
Sec. 301.30  Subgrants to local educational agencies.

    Each State that receives a grant under section 619 of the Act for 
any fiscal year shall distribute any funds it does not retain under 
Sec. 301.24 to local educational agencies in the State that have 
established their eligibility under section 613 of the Act.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1419(g)(1))


<R05>
Sec. 301.31  Allocations to local educational agencies.

    (a) Base payments. The State shall first award each agency described 
in Sec. 301.30 the amount that agency would have received under section 
619 of the Act for fiscal year 1997 if the State had distributed 75 
percent of its grant for that year under section 619(c)(3), as then in 
effect.
    (b) Base payment adjustments. For fiscal year 1998 and beyond--
    (1) If a new LEA is created, the State shall divide the base 
allocation determined under paragraph (a) of this section for the LEAs 
that would have been responsible for serving children with disabilities 
now being served by the new LEA, among the new LEA and affected LEAs 
based on the relative numbers of children with disabilities ages 3 
through 5 currently provided special education by each of the LEAs;
    (2) If one or more LEAs are combined into a single new LEA, the 
State shall combine the base allocations of the merged LEAs; and
    (3) If for two or more LEAs, geographic boundaries or administrative 
responsibility for providing services to children with disabilities ages 
3 through 5 changes, the base allocations of affected LEAs shall be 
redistributed among affected LEAs based on the relative numbers of 
children with disabilities ages 3 through 5 currently provided special 
education by each affected LEA.
    (c) Allocation of remaining funds. After making allocations under 
paragraph (a) of this section, the State shall--
    (1) Allocate 85 percent of any remaining funds to those agencies on 
the basis of the relative numbers of children enrolled in public and 
private elementary and secondary schools within the agency's 
jurisdiction; and
    (2) Allocate 15 percent of those remaining funds to those agencies 
in accordance with their relative numbers of children living in poverty, 
as determined by the SEA.
    (3) For the purpose of making grants under this section, States must 
apply on a uniform basis across all LEAs the best data that are 
available to them on the numbers of children enrolled in public and 
private elementary and secondary schools and the numbers of children 
living in poverty.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1419(g)(1))


<R05>
Sec. 301.32  Reallocation of local education agency funds.

    (a) If a SEA determines that an LEA is adequately providing a free 
appropriate public education to all children with disabilities aged 3 
through 5 residing in the area served by that agency with State and 
local funds, the SEA may reallocate any portion of the funds under 
section 619 of the Act that are not needed by that local agency to 
provide a free appropriate public education to other local educational 
agencies in the State that are not adequately providing special 
education and related services to all children with disabilities aged 3 
through 5 residing in the areas they serve.
    (b) If a State provides services to preschool children with 
disabilities because some or all LEAs and ESAs are unable or unwilling 
to provide appropriate programs, the SEA may use payments that would 
have been available to those LEAs or ESAs to provide special education 
and related services to children with disabilities aged 3 through 5 
years, and to two-year-old

[[Page 95]]

children with disabilities receiving services consistent with Sec. 301.1 
who are residing in the area served by those LEAs and ESAs.

<R05>
Sec. 303.13  Health services.

    (a) As used in this part, health services means services necessary 
to enable a child to benefit from the other early intervention services 
under this part during the time that the child is receiving the other 
early intervention services.
    (b) The term includes--
    (1) Such services as clean intermittent catheterization, 
tracheostomy care, tube feeding, the changing of dressings or colostomy 
collection bags, and other health services; and
    (2) Consultation by physicians with other service providers 
concerning the special health care needs of eligible children that will 
need to be addressed in the course of providing other early intervention 
services.
    (c) The term does not include the following:
    (1) Services that are--
    (i) Surgical in nature (such as cleft palate surgery, surgery for 
club foot, or the shunting of hydrocephalus); or
    (ii) Purely medical in nature (such as hospitalization for 
management of congenital heart ailments, or the prescribing of medicine 
or drugs for any purpose).
    (2) Devices necessary to control or treat a medical condition.
    (3) Medical-health services (such as immunizations and regular 
``well-baby'' care) that are routinely recommended for all children.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1432(4))


    Note: The definition in this section distinguishes between the 
health services that are required under this part and the medical-health 
services that are not required. The IFSP requirements in subpart D of 
this part provide that, to the extent appropriate, these other medical-
health services are to be included in the IFSP, along with the funding 
sources to be used in paying for the services or the steps that will be 
taken to secure the services through public or private sources. 
Identifying these services in the IFSP does not impose an obligation to 
provide the services if they are otherwise not required to be provided 
under this part. (See Sec. 303.344(e) and the note 3 following that 
section.)


<R05>
Sec. 303.14  IFSP.

    As used in this part, IFSP means the individualized family service 
plan, as that term is defined in Sec. 303.340(b).

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1436)


<R05>
Sec. 303.15  Include; including.

    As used in this part, include or including means that the items 
named are not all of the possible items that are covered whether like or 
unlike the ones named.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1431-1445)


<R05>
Sec. 303.16  Infants and toddlers with disabilities.

    (a) As used in this part, infants and toddlers with disabilities 
means individuals from birth through age two who need early intervention 
services because they--
    (1) Are experiencing developmental delays, as measured by 
appropriate diagnostic instruments and procedures, in one or more of the 
following areas:
    (i) Cognitive development.
    (ii) Physical development, including vision and hearing.
    (iii) Communication development.
    (iv) Social or emotional development.
    (v) Adaptive development; or
    (2) Have a diagnosed physical or mental condition that has a high 
probability of resulting in developmental delay.
    (b) The term may also include, at a State's discretion, children 
from birth through age two who are at risk of having substantial 
developmental delays if early intervention services are not provided.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1432(5))


    Note 1: The phrase ``a diagnosed physical or mental condition that 
has a high probability of resulting in developmental delay,'' as used in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section, applies to a condition if it typically 
results in developmental delay. Examples of these conditions include 
chromosomal abnormalities; genetic or congenital disorders; severe 
sensory impairments, including hearing and vision; inborn errors of 
metabolism; disorders reflecting disturbance of the development of the 
nervous system; congenital infections; disorders secondary to exposure 
to

[[Page 103]]

toxic substances, including fetal alcohol syndrome; and severe 
attachment disorders.


    Note 2: With respect to paragraph (b) of this section, children who 
are at risk may be eligible under this part if a State elects to extend 
services to that population, even though they have not been identified 
as disabled.
    Under this provision, States have the authority to define who would 
be ``at risk of having substantial developmental delays if early 
intervention services are not provided.'' In defining the ``at risk'' 
population, States may include well-known biological and environmental 
factors that can be identified and that place infants and toddlers ``at 
risk'' for developmental delay. Commonly cited factors include low birth 
weight, respiratory distress as a newborn, lack of oxygen, brain 
hemorrhage, infection, nutritional deprivation, and a history of abuse 
or neglect. It should be noted that ``at risk'' factors do not predict 
the presence of a barrier to development, but they may indicate children 
who are at higher risk of developmental delay than children without 
these problems.

intended to affect the authority to seek reimbursement for services 
provided under Medicaid or any other legislation that makes reference to 
``case management'' services. See H.R. Rep. No. 198, 102d Cong., 1st

    (a) The control of funds provided under this part, and title to

    The statement must include an assurance satisfactory to the 
Secretary that funds made available under this part will not be 
commingled with State funds.

(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 
1820-0550)


(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1437(b)(5)(A))


    Note: As used in this part, commingle means depositing or recording 
funds in a general account without the ability to identify each specific 
source of funds for any expenditure. Under that general definition, it 
is clear that commingling is prohibited. However, to the extent that the 
funds from each of a series of Federal, State, local, and private 
funding sources can be identified--with a clear audit trail for each 
source--it is appropriate for those funds to be consolidated for 
carrying out a common purpose. In fact, a State may find it essential to 
set out a funding plan that incorporates, and accounts for, all sources 
of funds that can be targeted on a given activity or function related to 
the State's early intervention program.
    Thus, the assurance in this section is satisfied by the use of an 
accounting system that includes an ``audit trail'' of the expenditure of 
funds awarded under this part. Separate bank accounts are not required.


<R05>
Sec. 303.124  Prohibition against supplanting.

    (a) The statement must include an assurance satisfactory to the 
Secretary that Federal funds made available under this part will be used 
to supplement the level of State and local funds expended for children 
eligible under this part and their families and in no case to supplant 
those State and local funds.
    (b) To meet the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section, the 
total amount of State and local funds budgeted for expenditures in the 
current fiscal year for early intervention services for children 
eligible under this part and their families must be at least equal to 
the total amount of State and local funds actually expended for early 
intervention services for these children and their families in the most 
recent preceding fiscal year for which the information is available. 
Allowance may be made for--
    (1) Decreases in the number of children who are eligible to receive 
early intervention services under this part; and
    (2) Unusually large amounts of funds expended for such long-term 
purposes as the acquisition of equipment and the construction of 
facilities.

    (a) General. (1) Each system must include the performance of a 
timely, comprehensive, multidisciplinary evaluation of each child, birth 
through age two, referred for evaluation, and a family-directed 
identification of the needs of each child's family to appropriately 
assist in the development of the child.
    (2) The lead agency shall be responsible for ensuring that the 
requirements of this section are implemented by all affected public 
agencies and service providers in the State.
    (b) Definitions of evaluation and assessment. As used in this part--
    (1) Evaluation means the procedures used by appropriate qualified 
personnel to determine a child's initial and continuing eligibility 
under this part, consistent with the definition of ``infants and 
toddlers with disabilities'' in Sec. 303.16, including determining the 
status of the child in each of the developmental areas in paragraph 
(c)(3)(ii) of this section.
    (2) Assessment means the ongoing procedures used by appropriate 
qualified personnel throughout the period of a child's eligibility under 
this part to identify--
    (i) The child's unique strengths and needs and the services 
appropriate to meet those needs; and
    (ii) The resources, priorities, and concerns of the family and the 
supports and services necessary to enhance the family's capacity to meet 
the developmental needs of their infant or toddler with a disability.
    (c) Evaluation and assessment of the child. The evaluation and 
assessment of each child must--
    (1) Be conducted by personnel trained to utilize appropriate methods 
and procedures;
    (2) Be based on informed clinical opinion; and
    (3) Include the following:
    (i) A review of pertinent records related to the child's current 
health status and medical history.
    (ii) An evaluation of the child's level of functioning in each of 
the following developmental areas:
    (A) Cognitive development.
    (B) Physical development, including vision and hearing.
    (C) Communication development.
    (D) Social or emotional development.
    (E) Adaptive development.
    (iii) An assessment of the unique needs of the child in terms of 
each of the developmental areas in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, 
including the identification of services appropriate to meet those 
needs.
    (d) Family assessment. (1) Family assessments under this part must 
be family-directed and designed to determine the resources, priorities, 
and concerns of the family and the identification of the supports and 
services necessary to enhance the family's capacity to meet the 
developmental needs of the child.
    (2) Any assessment that is conducted must be voluntary on the part 
of the family.
    (3) If an assessment of the family is carried out, the assessment 
must--
    (i) Be conducted by personnel trained to utilize appropriate methods 
and procedures;
    (ii) Be based on information provided by the family through a 
personal interview; and
    (iii) Incorporate the family's description of its resources, 
priorities, and concerns related to enhancing the child's development.
    (e) Timelines. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this 
section, the evaluation and initial assessment of

[[Page 117]]

each child (including the family assessment) must be completed within 
the 45-day time period required in Sec. 303.321(e).
    (2) The lead agency shall develop procedures to ensure that in the 
event of exceptional circumstances that make it impossible to complete 
the evaluation and assessment within 45 days (e.g., if a child is ill), 
public agencies will--
    (i) Document those circumstances; and
    (ii) Develop and implement an interim IFSP, to the extent 
appropriate and consistent with Sec. 303.345 (b)(1) and (b)(2).

under this part shall ensure, at a minimum, that--
    (a) Tests and other evaluation materials and procedures are 
administered in the native language of the parents or other mode of 
communication, unless it is clearly not feasible to do so;
    (b) Any assessment and evaluation procedures and materials that are 
used are selected and administered so as not to be racially or 
culturally discriminatory;
    (c) No single procedure is used as the sole criterion for 
determining a child's eligibility under this part; and
    (d) Evaluations and assessments are conducted by qualified 
personnel.

               Individualized Family Service Plans (IFSPs)


<R05>
Sec. 303.340  General.

    (a) Each system must include policies and procedures regarding 
individualized family service plans (IFSPs) that meet the requirements 
of this section and Secs. 303.341 through 303.346.
    (b) As used in this part, individualized family service plan and 
IFSP mean a written plan for providing early intervention services to a 
child eligible under this part and the child's family. The plan must--
    (1) Be developed in accordance with Secs. 303.342 and 303.343;
    (2) Be based on the evaluation and assessment described in 
Sec. 303.322; and
    (3) Include the matters specified in Sec. 303.344.
    (c) Lead agency responsibility. The lead agency shall ensure that an 
IFSP is developed and implemented for each eligible child, in accordance 
with the requirements of this part. If there is a dispute between 
agencies as to who has responsibility for developing or implementing an 
IFSP, the lead agency shall resolve the dispute or assign 
responsibility.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1436)


    Note: In instances where an eligible child must have both an IFSP 
and an individualized service plan under another Federal program, it may 
be possible to develop a single consolidated document, provided that it 
(1) contains all of the required information in Sec. 303.344, and (2) is 
developed in accordance with the requirements of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 303.341  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 303.342  Procedures for IFSP development, review, and evaluation.

    (a) Meeting to develop initial IFSP--timelines. For a child who has 
been evaluated for the first time and determined to be eligible, a 
meeting to develop the initial IFSP must be conducted within the 45-day 
time period in Sec. 303.321(e).
    (b) Periodic review. (1) A review of the IFSP for a child and the 
child's family must be conducted every six months,

[[Page 118]]

or more frequently if conditions warrant, or if the family requests such 
a review. The purpose of the periodic review is to determine--
    (i) The degree to which progress toward achieving the outcomes is 
being made; and
    (ii) Whether modification or revision of the outcomes or services is 
necessary.
    (2) The review may be carried out by a meeting or by another means 
that is acceptable to the parents and other participants.
    (c) Annual meeting to evaluate the IFSP. A meeting must be conducted 
on at least an annual basis to evaluate the IFSP for a child and the 
child's family, and, as appropriate, to revise its provisions. The 
results of any current evaluations conducted under Sec. 303.322(c), and 
other information available from the ongoing assessment of the child and 
family, must be used in determining what services are needed and will be 
provided.
    (d) Accessibility and convenience of meetings. (1) IFSP meetings 
must be conducted--
    (i) In settings and at times that are convenient to families; and
    (ii) In the native language of the family or other mode of 
communication used by the family, unless it is clearly not feasible to 
do so.
    (2) Meeting arrangements must be made with, and written notice 
provided to, the family and other participants early enough before the 
meeting date to ensure that they will be able to attend.
    (e) Parental consent. The contents of the IFSP must be fully 
explained to the parents and informed written consent from the parents 
must be obtained prior to the provision of early intervention services 
described in the plan. If the parents do not provide consent with 
respect to a particular early intervention service or withdraw consent 
after first providing it, that service may not be provided. The early 
intervention services to which parental consent is obtained must be 
provided.

(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 
1820-0550)


(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1436)


    Note: The requirement for the annual evaluation incorporates the 
periodic review process. Therefore, it is necessary to have only one 
separate periodic review each year (i.e., six months after the initial 
and subsequent annual IFSP meetings), unless conditions warrant 
otherwise.

    Because the needs of infants and toddlers change so rapidly during 
the course of a year, certain evaluation procedures may need to be 
repeated before conducting the periodic reviews and annual evaluation 
meetings in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 303.343  Participants in IFSP meetings and periodic reviews.

    (a) Initial and annual IFSP meetings. (1) Each initial meeting and 
each annual meeting to evaluate the IFSP must include the following 
participants:
    (i) The parent or parents of the child.
    (ii) Other family members, as requested by the parent, if feasible 
to do so;
    (iii) An advocate or person outside of the family, if the parent 
requests that the person participate.
    (iv) The service coordinator who has been working with the family 
since the initial referral of the child for evaluation, or who has been 
designated by the public agency to be responsible for implementation of 
the IFSP.
    (v) A person or persons directly involved in conducting the 
evaluations and assessments in Sec. 303.322.
    (vi) As appropriate, persons who will be providing services to the 
child or family.
    (2) If a person listed in paragraph (a)(1)(v) of this section is 
unable to attend a meeting, arrangements must be made for the person's 
involvement through other means, including--
    (i) Participating in a telephone conference call;
    (ii) Having a knowledgeable authorized representative attend the 
meeting; or
    (iii) Making pertinent records available at the meeting.
    (b) Periodic review. Each periodic review must provide for the 
participation of persons in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (a)(1)(iv) of 
this section. If conditions warrant, provisions must be

[[Page 119]]

made for the participation of other representatives identified in 
paragraph (a) of this section.

    (ii) The funding sources to be used in paying for those services or 
the steps that will be taken to secure those services through public or 
private sources.
    (2) The requirement in paragraph (e)(1) of this section does not 
apply to routine medical services (e.g., immunizations and ``well-baby'' 
care), unless a child needs those services and the services are not 
otherwise available or being provided.
    (f) Dates; duration of services. The IFSP must include--
    (1) The projected dates for initiation of the services in paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section as soon as possible after the IFSP meetings

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1436(d))


    Note 1: With respect to the requirements in paragraph (d) of this 
section, the appropriate location of services for some infants and 
toddlers might be a hospital setting--during the period in which they 
require extensive medical intervention. However, for these and other 
eligible children, early intervention services must be provided in 
natural environments (e.g., the home, child care centers, or other 
community settings) to the maximum extent appropriate to the needs of 
the child.


    Note 2: Throughout the process of developing and implementing IFSPs 
for an eligible child and the child's family, it is important for 
agencies to recognize the variety of roles that family members play in 
enhancing the child's development. It also is important that the degree 
to which the needs of the family are addressed in the IFSP process is 
determined in a collaborative manner with the full agreement and 
participation of the parents of the child. Parents retain the ultimate 
decision in determining whether they, their child, or other family 
members will accept or decline services under this part.


    Note 3: The early intervention services in paragraph (d) of this 
section are those services that a State is required to provide to a 
child in accordance with Sec. 303.12.

    The ``other services'' in paragraph (e) of this section are services 
that a child or family needs, but that are neither required nor covered 
under this part. While listing the non-required services in the IFSP 
does not mean that those services must be provided, their identification 
can be helpful to both the child's family and the service coordinator, 
for the following reasons: First, the IFSP would provide a comprehensive 
picture of the child's total service needs (including the need for 
medical and health services, as well as early intervention services). 
Second, it is appropriate for the service coordinator to assist the 
family in securing the non-required services (e.g., by (1) determining 
if there is a public agency that could provide financial assistance, if 
needed, (2) assisting in the preparation of eligibility claims or 
insurance claims, if needed, and (3) assisting the family in seeking out 
and arranging for the child to receive the needed medical-health 
services).
    Thus, to the extent appropriate, it is important for a State's 
procedures under this part to provide for ensuring that other needs of 
the child, and of the family related to enhancing the development of the 
child, such as medical and health needs, are considered and addressed, 
including determining (1) who will provide each service, and when, 
where, and how it will be provided, and (2) how the service will be paid 
for (e.g., through private insurance, an existing Federal-State funding 
source, such as Medicaid or EPSDT, or some other funding arrangement).


    Note 4: Although the IFSP must include information about each of the 
items in paragraphs (b) through (h) of this section, this does not mean 
that the IFSP must be a detailed, lengthy document. It might be a brief 
outline, with appropriate attachments that address each of the points in 
the paragraphs under this section. It is important for the IFSP itself 
to be clear about (a) what services are to be provided, (b) the actions 
that are to be taken by the service coordinator in initiating those 
services, and (c) what actions will be taken by the parents.

Sec. 303.345  Provision of services before evaluation and assessment are completed.

    Early intervention services for an eligible child and the child's 
family may commence before the completion of the

[[Page 121]]

evaluation and assessment in Sec. 303.322, if the following conditions 
are met:
    (a) Parental consent is obtained.
    (b) An interim IFSP is developed that includes--
    (1) The name of the service coordinator who will be responsible, 
consistent with Sec. 303.344(g), for implementation of the interim IFSP 
and coordination with other agencies and persons; and
    (2) The early intervention services that have been determined to be 
needed immediately by the child and the child's family.
    (c) The evaluation and assessment are completed within the time 
period required in Sec. 303.322(e).

    Note: This section is intended to accomplish two specific purposes: 
(1) To facilitate the provision of services in the event that a child 
has obvious immediate needs that are identified, even at the time of 
referral (e.g., a physician recommends that a child with cerebral palsy 
begin receiving physical therapy as soon as possible), and (2) to ensure 
that the requirements for the timely evaluation and assessment are not 
circumvented.


<R05>
Sec. 303.346  Responsibility and accountability.

    Each agency or person who has a direct role in the provision of 
early intervention services is responsible for making a good faith 
effort to assist each eligible child in achieving the outcomes in the 
child's IFSP. However, part C of the Act does not require that any 
agency or person be held accountable if an eligible child does not 
achieve the growth projected in the child's IFSP.

    (i) Are based on the highest requirements in the State applicable to 
the profession or discipline in which a person is providing early 
intervention services; and
    (ii) Establish suitable qualifications for personnel providing early 
intervention services under this part to eligible children and their 
families who are served by State, local, and private agencies.
    (2) Highest requirements in the State applicable to a specific 
profession or discipline means the highest entry-level academic degree 
needed for any State approved or recognized certification, licensing, 
registration, or other comparable requirements that apply to that 
profession or discipline.
    (3) Profession or discipline means a specific occupational category 
that--
    (i) Provides early intervention services to children eligible under 
this part and their families;
    (ii) Has been established or designated by the State; and
    (iii) Has a required scope of responsibility and degree of 
supervision.
    (4) State approved or recognized certification, licensing, 
registration, or other comparable requirements means the requirements 
that a State legislature either has enacted or has authorized a State

standards for employment in a specific profession or discipline in that 
State.
    (b)(1) Each statewide system must have policies and procedures 
relating to the establishment and maintenance of standards to ensure 
that personnel necessary to carry out the purposes of this part are 
appropriately and adequately prepared and trained.
    (2) The policies and procedures required in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section must provide for the establishment and maintenance of standards 
that are consistent with any State-approved or State-recognized 
certification, licensing, registration, or other comparable requirements 
that apply to the profession or discipline in which a person is 
providing early intervention services.
    (c) To the extent that a State's standards for a profession or 
discipline, including standards for temporary or emergency 
certification, are not based on the highest requirements in the State 
applicable to a specific profession or discipline, the State's 
application for assistance under this part must include the steps the 
State is taking, the procedures for notifying public agencies and 
personnel of those steps, and the timelines it has established for the 
retraining or hiring of personnel that meet appropriate professional 
requirements in the State.
    (d)(1) In meeting the requirements in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this 
section, a determination must be made about the status of personnel 
standards in the State. That determination must be based on current 
information that accurately describes, for each profession or discipline 
in which personnel are providing early intervention services, whether 
the applicable standards are consistent with the highest requirements in 
the State for that profession or discipline.
    (2) The information required in paragraph (d)(1) of this section 
must be on file in the lead agency, and available to the public.
    (e) In identifying the ``highest requirements in the State'' for 
purposes of this section, the requirements of all State statutes and the 
rules of all State agencies applicable to serving children eligible 
under this part and their families must be considered.
    (f) A State may allow paraprofessionals and assistants who are 
appropriately trained and supervised, in accordance with State law, 
regulations, or written policy, to assist in the provision of early 
intervention services to eligible children under this part.
    (g) In implementing this section, a State may adopt a policy that 
includes making ongoing good-faith efforts to recruit and hire 
appropriately and adequately trained personnel to provide early 
intervention services to eligible children, including, in a geographic 
area of the State where there is a shortage of personnel that meet these 
qualifications, the most qualified individuals available who are making 
satisfactory progress toward completing applicable course work necessary 
to

highest requirements to determine the standards appropriate to personnel 
who provide early intervention services under this part. The regulations 
do not require States to set any specified training standard, such as a 
master's degree, for employment of personnel who provide services under 
this part.
    The regulations permit each State to determine the specific 
occupational categories required to provide early intervention services 
to children eligible under this part and their families, and to revise 
or expand these categories as needed. The professions or disciplines 
need not be limited to traditional occupational categories.

to the activity for which consent is sought, in the parent's native 
language or other mode of communication;
    (2) The parent understands and agrees in writing to the carrying out 
of the activity for which consent is sought, and the consent describes 
that activity and lists the records (if any) that will be released and 
to whom; and
    (3) The parent understands that the granting of consent is voluntary 
on the part of the parent and may be revoked at any time;
    (b) Native language, where used with reference to persons of limited 
English proficiency, means the language or mode of communication

member;
    (2) The address of the child;
    (3) A personal identifier, such as the child's or parent's social 
security number; or
    (4) A list of personal characteristics or other information that 
would make it possible to identify the child with reasonable certainty.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1439)


<R05>
Sec. 303.402  Opportunity to examine records.

    In accordance with the confidentiality procedures in the regulations 
under part B of the Act (34 CFR 300.560 through 300.576), the parents of 
a child eligible under this part must be afforded the opportunity to 
inspect and review records relating to evaluations and assessments, 
eligibility determinations, development and implementation of IFSPs, 
individual complaints dealing with the child, and any other area under 
this part involving records about the child and the child's family.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1439(a)(4))


<R05>
Sec. 303.403  Prior notice; native language.

    (a) General. Written prior notice must be given to the parents of a 
child eligible under this part a reasonable time before a public agency 
or service provider proposes, or refuses, to initiate or change the 
identification, evaluation, or placement of the child, or the provision 
of appropriate early intervention services to the child and the child's 
family.
    (b) Content of notice. The notice must be in sufficient detail to 
inform the parents about--

[[Page 124]]

    (1) The action that is being proposed or refused;
    (2) The reasons for taking the action; and
    (3) All procedural safeguards that are available under this part.
    (c) Native language. (1) The notice must be--
    (i) Written in language understandable to the general public; and
    (ii) Provided in the native language of the parents, unless it is 
clearly not feasible to do so.
    (2) If the native language or other mode of communication of the

service provider, shall take steps to ensure that--
    (i) The notice is translated orally or by other means to the parent 
in the parent's native language or other mode of communication;
    (ii) The parent understands the notice; and
    (iii) There is written evidence that the requirements of this 
paragraph have been met.
    (3) If a parent is deaf or blind, or has no written language, the 
mode of communication must be that normally used by the parent (such as 
sign language, braille, or oral communication).

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1480(6) and (7))


<R05>
Sec. 303.404  Parent consent.

    (a) Written parental consent must be obtained before--
    (1) Conducting the initial evaluation and assessment of a child 
under Sec. 303.322; and
    (2) Initiating the provision of early intervention services (see 
Sec. 303.342(e)).
    (b) If consent is not given, the public agency shall make reasonable 
efforts to ensure that the parent--
    (1) Is fully aware of the nature of the evaluation and assessment or 
the services that would be available; and
    (2) Understands that the child will not be able to receive the 
evaluation and assessment or services unless consent is given.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1439)


    Note 1: In addition to the consent requirements in this section, 
other consent requirements are included in (1) Sec. 303.460(a), 
regarding the exchange of personally identifiable information among 
agencies, and (2) the confidentiality provisions in the regulations 
under part B of the Act (34 CFR 300.571) and 34 CFR part 99 (Family 
Educational Rights and Privacy), both of which apply to this part.


    Note 2: Under Sec. 300.504(b) of the part B regulations, a public 
agency may initiate procedures to challenge a parent's refusal to 
consent to the initial evaluation of the parent's child and, if 
successful, obtain the evaluation. This provision applies to eligible 
children under this part, since the part B evaluation requirement 
applies to all children with disabilities in a State, including infants 
and toddlers.


<R05>
Sec. 303.405  Parent right to decline service.

    The parents of a child eligible under this part may determine 
whether they, their child, or other family members will accept or 
decline any early intervention service under this part in accordance 
with State law, and may decline such a service after first accepting it, 
without jeopardizing other early intervention services under this part.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1439(a)(3))


<R05>
Sec. 303.406  Surrogate parents.

    (a) General. Each lead agency shall ensure that the rights of 
children eligible under this part are protected if--
    (1) No parent (as defined in Sec. 303.18) can be identified;
    (2) The public agency, after reasonable efforts, cannot discover the 
whereabouts of a parent; or
    (3) The child is a ward of the State under the laws of that State.
    (b) Duty of lead agency and other public agencies. The duty of the 
lead agency, or other public agency under paragraph (a) of this section, 
includes the assignment of an individual to act as a surrogate for the 
parent. This must include a method for--
    (1) Determining whether a child needs a surrogate parent; and
    (2) Assigning a surrogate parent to the child.
    (c) Criteria for selecting surrogates. (1) The lead agency or other 
public agency may select a surrogate parent in any way permitted under 
State law.
    (2) Public agencies shall ensure that a person selected as a 
surrogate parent--

[[Page 125]]

    (i) Has no interest that conflicts with the interests of the child 
he or she represents; and
    (ii) Has knowledge and skills that ensure adequate representation of 
the child.
    (d) Non-employee requirement; compensation. (1) A person assigned as 
a surrogate parent may not be--
    (i) An employee of any State agency; or
    (ii) A person or an employee of a person providing early 
intervention services to the child or to any family member of the child.
    (2) A person who otherwise qualifies to be a surrogate parent under 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section is not an employee solely because he or 
she is paid by a public agency to serve as a surrogate parent.
    (e) Responsibilities. A surrogate parent may represent a child in 
all matters related to--
    (1) The evaluation and assessment of the child;
    (2) Development and implementation of the child's IFSPs, including 
annual evaluations and periodic reviews;
    (3) The ongoing provision of early intervention services to the 
child; and
    (4) Any other rights established under this part.

      Mediation and Due Process Procedures for Parents and Children


<R05>
Sec. 303.419  Mediation.

    (a) General. Each State shall ensure that procedures are established 
and implemented to allow parties to disputes involving any matter 
described in Sec. 303.403(a) to resolve the disputes through a mediation 
process which, at a minimum, must be available whenever a hearing is 
requested under Sec. 303.420. The lead agency may either use the 
mediation system established under Part B of the Act or establish its 
own system.
    (b) Requirements. The procedures must meet the following 
requirements:
    (1) The procedures must ensure that the mediation process--
    (i) Is voluntary on the part of the parties;
    (ii) Is not used to deny or delay a parent's right to a due process 
hearing under Sec. 303.420, or to deny any other rights afforded under 
Part C of the Act; and
    (iii) Is conducted by a qualified and impartial mediator who is 
trained in effective mediation techniques.
    (2) The State shall maintain a list of individuals who are qualified 
mediators and knowledgeable in laws and regulations relating to the 
provision of special education and related services.
    (3) The State shall bear the cost of the mediation process, 
including the costs of meetings described in paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (4) Each session in the mediation process must be scheduled in a 
timely manner and must be held in a location that is convenient to the 
parties to the dispute.
    (5) An agreement reached by the parties to the dispute in the 
mediation process must be set forth in a written mediation agreement.
    (6) Discussions that occur during the mediation process must be 
confidential and may not be used as evidence in any subsequent due 
process hearings or civil proceedings, and the parties to the mediation 
process may be required to sign a confidentiality pledge prior to the 
commencement of the process.
    (c) Meeting to encourage mediation. A State may establish procedures 
to require parents who elect not to use the mediation process to meet, 
at a time and location convenient to the parents, with a disinterested 
party--
    (1) Who is under contract with a parent training and information 
center or community parent resource center in the State established 
under sections 682 or 683 of the Act, or an appropriate alternative 
dispute resolution entity; and
    (2) Who would explain the benefits of the mediation process and 
encourage the parents to use the process.

[63 FR 18296, Apr. 14, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 303.420  Due process procedures.

    Each system must include written procedures including procedures for 
mediation as described in Sec. 303.419, for the timely administrative 
resolution of

[[Page 126]]

individual child complaints by parents concerning any of the matters in 
Sec. 303.403(a). A State may meet this requirement by--
    (a) Adopting the mediation and due process procedures in 34 CFR 
300.506 through 300.512 and developing procedures that meet the 
requirements of Sec. 303.425; or
    (b) Developing procedures that--
    (1) Meet the requirements in Sec. 303.419 and Secs. 303.421 through 
303.425; and
    (2) Provide parents a means of filing a complaint.

(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 
1820-0550)


(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1439(a)(1))


    Note 1: Sections 303.420 through 303.425 are concerned with the 
adoption of impartial procedures for resolving individual child 
complaints (i.e., complaints that generally affect only a single child 
or the child's family). These procedures require the appointment of a 
decision-maker who is impartial, as defined in Sec. 303.421(b), to 
resolve a dispute concerning any of the matters in Sec. 303.403(a). The 
decision of the impartial decision-maker is binding unless it is 
reversed on appeal.
    A different type of administrative procedure is included in 
Secs. 303.510 through 303.512 of subpart F of this part. Under those 
procedures, the lead agency is responsible for (1) investigating any 
complaint that it receives (including individual child complaints and 
those that are systemic in nature), and (2) resolving the complaint if 
the agency determines that a violation has occurred.


    Note 2: It is important that the administrative procedures developed 
by a State be designed to result in speedy resolution of complaints. An 
infant's or toddler's development is so rapid that undue delay could be 
potentially harmful.

<R05>
Sec. 303.421  Appointment of an impartial person.

    (a) Qualifications and duties. An impartial person must be appointed 
to implement the complaint resolution process in this subpart. The 
person must--
    (1) Have knowledge about the provisions of this part and the needs 
of, and services available for, eligible children and their families; 
and
    (2) Perform the following duties:
    (i) Listen to the presentation of relevant viewpoints about the 
complaint, examine all information relevant to the issues, and seek to 
reach a timely resolution of the complaint.
    (ii) Provide a record of the proceedings, including a written 
decision.
    (b) Definition of impartial. (1) As used in this section, impartial 
means that the person appointed to implement the complaint resolution 
process--
    (i) Is not an employee of any agency or other entity involved in the 
provision of early intervention services or care of the child; and
    (ii) Does not have a personal or professional interest that would 
conflict with his or her objectivity in implementing the process.
    (2) A person who otherwise qualifies under paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section is not an employee of an agency solely because the person is 
paid by the agency to implement the complaint resolution process.

<R05>
Sec. 303.422  Parent rights in administrative proceedings.

    (a) General. Each lead agency shall ensure that the parents of 
children eligible under this part are afforded the rights in paragraph 
(b) of this section in any administrative proceedings carried out under 
Sec. 303.420.
    (b) Rights. Any parent involved in an administrative proceeding has 
the right to--
    (1) Be accompanied and advised by counsel and by individuals with 
special knowledge or training with respect to early intervention 
services for children eligible under this part;
    (2) Present evidence and confront, cross-examine, and compel the 
attendance of witnesses;
    (3) Prohibit the introduction of any evidence at the proceeding that 
has not been disclosed to the parent at least five days before the 
proceeding;
    (4) Obtain a written or electronic verbatim transcription of the 
proceeding; and

[[Page 127]]

    (5) Obtain written findings of fact and decisions.

Sec. 303.423  Convenience of proceedings; timelines.

    (a) Any proceeding for implementing the complaint resolution process 
in this subpart must be carried out at a time and place that is 
reasonably convenient to the parents.
    (b) Each lead agency shall ensure that, not later than 30 days after 
the receipt of a parent's complaint, the impartial proceeding required 
under this subpart is completed and a written decision mailed to each of 
the parties.

(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 
1820-0550)


(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1439(a)(1))


    Note: Under part B of the Act, States are allowed 45 days to conduct 
an impartial due process hearing (i.e., within 45 days after the receipt 
of a request for a hearing, a decision is reached and a copy of the 
decision is mailed to each of the parties). (See 34 CFR 300.512.) Thus, 
if a State, in meeting the requirements of Sec. 303.420, elects to adopt 
the due process procedures under part B, that State would also have 45 
days for hearings. However, any State in that situation is encouraged 
(but not required) to accelerate the timeline for the due process 
hearing for children who are eligible under this part--from 45 days to 
the 30-day timeline in this section. Because the needs of children in 
the birth-through-two-age range change so rapidly, quick resolution of 
complaints is important.


<R05>
Sec. 303.424  Civil action.

    Any party aggrieved by the findings and decision regarding an 
administrative complaint has the right to bring a civil action in State 
or Federal court under section 639(a)(1) of the Act.

    (a) During the pendency of any proceeding involving a complaint 
under this subpart, unless the public agency and parents of a child 
otherwise agree, the child must continue to receive the appropriate 
early intervention services currently being provided.
    (b) If the complaint involves an application for initial services 
under this part, the child must receive those services that are not in 
dispute.

<R05>
Sec. 303.460  Confidentiality of information.

    (a) Each State shall adopt or develop policies and procedures that 
the State will follow in order to ensure the protection of any 
personally identifiable information collected, used, or maintained under 
this part, including the right of parents to written notice of and 
written consent to the exchange of this information among agencies 
consistent with Federal and State law.
    (b) These policies and procedures must meet the requirements in 34 
CFR 300.560 through 300.576, with the modifications specified in 
Sec. 303.5(b).

(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number

    Note: With the modifications referred to in paragraph (b) of this

implementing part B of the Act (34 CFR 300.560 through 300.576) are to 
be used by public agencies to meet the confidentiality requirements 
under part C of the Act and this section (Sec. 303.460).
    The part B provisions incorporate by reference the regulations in 34

             Lead Agency Procedures for Resolving Complaints


<R05>
Sec. 303.510  Adopting complaint procedures.

    Each lead agency shall adopt written procedures for--
    (a) Resolving any complaint that any public agency is violating a 
requirement of part C of the Act or this part by--
    (1) Providing for the filing of a complaint with the lead agency; 
and
    (2) At the lead agency's discretion, providing for the filing of a

(1) any public agency in the State that receives funds under this part 
(e.g., the lead agency and the Council), (2) other public agencies that 
are involved in the State's early intervention program, or (3) private 
service providers that receive part C funds on a contract basis from a 
public agency to carry out a given function or provide a given service 
required under this part. These complaint procedures are in addition to 
any other rights under State or Federal law. The lead agency must

lead agency's discretion, with a public agency subject to a right of 
appeal to the lead agency.

program. The policies must--
    (1) Meet the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section; and
    (2) Be reflected in the interagency agreements required in

a system of payments, and include--
    (i) Information about the payment system and schedule of sliding 
fees that will be used; and
    (ii) The basis and amount of payments; and
    (3) Include an assurance that--
    (i) Fees will not be charged for the services that a child is 
otherwise entitled to receive at no cost to parents; and
    (ii) The inability of the parents of an eligible child to pay for 
services will not result in the denial of services to the child or the 
child's family; and
    (4) Set out any fees that will be charged for early intervention 
services and the basis for those fees.
    (c) Procedures to ensure the timely provision of services. No later 
than the beginning of the fifth year of a State's participation under

Sec. 303.523  Interagency agreements.

    (a) General. Each lead agency is responsible for entering into 
formal interagency agreements with other State-level agencies involved 
in the State's early intervention program. Each agreement must meet the 
requirements in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section.

[[Page 131]]

<R05>
Sec. 303.526  Policy for contracting or otherwise arranging for services.

    Each system must include a policy pertaining to contracting or 
making other arrangements with public or private service providers to 
provide early intervention services. The policy must include--
    (a) A requirement that all early intervention services must meet 
State standards and be consistent with the provisions of this part;

    Note: In implementing the statewide system, States may elect to 
continue using agencies and individuals in both the public and private 
sectors that have previously been involved in providing early 
intervention services, so long as those agencies and individuals meet 
the requirements of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 303.527  Payor of last resort.

    (a) Nonsubstitution of funds. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section, funds under this part may not be used to satisfy a 
financial commitment for services that would otherwise have been paid 
for from another public or private source, including any medical program 
administered by the Secretary of Defense, but for the enactment of part 
C of the Act. Therefore, funds under this part may be used only for 
early intervention services that an eligible child needs but is not 
currently entitled to under any other Federal, State, local, or private 
source.
    (b) Interim payments--reimbursement. (1) If necessary to prevent a 
delay in the timely provision of services to an eligible child or the 
child's family, funds under this part may be used to pay the provider of 
services, pending reimbursement from the agency or entity that has 
ultimate responsibility for the payment.
    (2) Payments under paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be made 
for--
    (i) Early intervention services, as described in Sec. 303.12;

[[Page 132]]

    (ii) Eligible health services (see Sec. 303.13); and
    (iii) Other functions and services authorized under this part, 
including child find and evaluation and assessment.
    (3) The provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section do not apply 
to medical services or ``well-baby'' health care (see 
Sec. 303.13(c)(1)).
    (c) Non-reduction of benefits. Nothing in this part may be construed 
to permit a State to reduce medical or other assistance available or to 
alter eligibility under title V of the Social Security Act (SSA) 
(relating to maternal and child health) or title XIX of the SSA 
(relating to Medicaid for children eligible under this part) within the 
State.

(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 
1820-0550)


(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1440)


    Note: The Congress intended that the enactment of part C not be 
construed as a license to any agency (including the lead agency and 
other agencies in the State) to withdraw funding for services that 
currently are or would be made available to eligible children but for 
the existence of the program under this part. Thus, the Congress 
intended that other funding sources would continue, and that there would 
be greater coordination among agencies regarding the payment of costs.
    The Congress further clarified its intent concerning payments under 
Medicaid by including in section 411(k)(13) of the Medicare Catastrophic 
Coverage Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-360) an amendment to title XIX of the 
Social Security Act. That amendment states, in effect, that nothing in 
this title shall be construed as prohibiting or restricting, or 
authorizing the Secretary of Health and Human Services to prohibit or 
restrict, payment under subsection (a) of section 1903 of the Social 
Security Act for medical assistance for covered services furnished to an 
infant or toddler with a disability because those services are included 
in the child's IFSP adopted pursuant to part C of the Act.

[[Page 138]]

    (1) The term Insular Area means American Samoa, Guam, the Virgin 
Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, or the Trust Territory of the 
Pacific Islands; and
    (2) The term children with disabilities means the number of children 
with disabilities determined by the Secretary--

    (ii) In average daily attendance at schools for children with 
disabilities or supported by a State agency within the meaning of 
section 1221 of chapter 1 of title I of the Elementary and Secondary 
Education Act of 1965.
    (b) The amount of an SEA's grant under this part for a State other 
than an Insular Area is determined by--
    (1) Dividing the number of children with disabilities in that State 
by the total number of children with disabilities in all States 
submitting approvable applications under this part; and
    (2) Multiplying that fraction by the amount of funds available for 
grants under this part minus the amount reserved under paragraphs (c) 
and (d) of this section.
    (c) The Secretary reserves up to one-half of one percent of the 
aggregate of the amounts available under this part for grants to Insular 
Areas. Funds reserved by the Secretary for the Insular Areas are 
allocated proportionately among them on the basis of the number of 
children ages three through twenty-one in each Insular Area. However, no 
Insular Area may receive less than $15,000, and allocations within these 
jurisdictions are ratably reduced, if necessary, to ensure that each 
Insular Area receives at least that amount. Allocations within these 
jurisdictions are further ratably reduced if the amount reserved is 
insufficient to provide $15,000 to each Insular Area.
    (d) From any appropriation enacted after September 30, 1986, the 
Secretary reserves up to 1.25 percent of the aggregate amount available 
under this part for a grant to the Secretary of the Interior to be used 
on reservations served by schools operated for Indian children by the

condition that has a high probability of resulting in developmental 
delays in hearing and vision, or are at risk of having substantial 
developmental delays in hearing and vision if early intervention 
services are not provided.

<R05>
Sec. 318.11  What priorities may the Secretary establish?

    (a) The Secretary may, through a notice published in the Federal 
Register, select annually one or more of the following priority areas 
for funding:
    (1) Preparation of personnel for careers in special education. This 
priority supports preservice preparation of personnel for careers in 
special education. Preservice training includes additional training for 
currently employed teachers seeking additional degrees, certifications, 
or endorsements. Training at the baccalaureate, masters, or specialist 
level is appropriate. Under this priority, ``personnel'' includes 
special education teachers, speech-language pathologists, audiologists, 
adapted physical education teachers, vocational educators, and 
instructive and assistive technology specialists.
    (2) Preparation of related services personnel. This priority 
supports preservice preparation of individuals to provide developmental, 
corrective, and other supportive services that assist children and youth 
with disabilities to benefit from special education. These include 
paraprofessional personnel, therapeutic recreation specialists, school 
social workers, health service providers, physical therapists, 
occupational therapists, school psychologists, counselors (including 
rehabilitation counselors), interpreters, orientation and mobility 
specialists, respite care providers, art therapists, volunteers, 
physicians, and other related services personnel.
    (i) Projects to train personnel identified as special education 
personnel in the regulations in this part are not appropriate, even if 
those personnel may be considered related services personnel in other 
settings.
    (ii) This priority is not designed for general training. Projects 
must include inducements and preparation to increase the probability 
that graduates will direct their efforts toward supportive services to 
special education. For example, a project in occupational therapy (OT) 
might support a special component on pediatric or juvenile psychiatric 
OT, support those students whose career goal is OT in the schools, or 
provide for practica and internships in school settings.
    (3) Training early intervention and preschool personnel. This 
priority supports projects that are designed to provide preservice 
preparation of personnel who serve infants, toddlers, and preschool 
children with disabilities, and their families. Personnel may be 
prepared to provide short-term services or

[[Page 181]]

long-term services that extend into a child's school program. The 
proposed training program must have a clear and limited focus on the 
special needs of children within the age range from birth through five, 
and must include consideration of family involvement in early 
intervention and preschool services. Training programs under this 
priority must have a significant interdisciplinary focus.
    (4) Preparation of leadership personnel. This priority supports 
projects that are designed to provide preservice professional 
preparation of leadership personnel in special education, related 
services, and early intervention. Leadership training is considered to 
be preparation in--
    (i) Supervision and administration at the advanced graduate, 
doctoral, and post-doctoral levels;
    (ii) Research; and
    (iii) Personnel preparation at the doctoral and post-doctoral 
levels.
    (5) Special projects. This priority supports projects that include 
development, evaluation, and distribution of innovative approaches to 
personnel preparation; development of curriculum materials to prepare 
personnel to educate or provide early intervention services; and other 
projects of national significance related to the preparation of 
personnel needed to serve infants, toddlers, children, and youth with 
disabilities.
    (i) Appropriate areas of interest include--
    (A) Preservice training programs to prepare regular educators to 
work with children and youth with disabilities and their families;
    (B) Training teachers to work in community and school settings with 
children and youth with disabilities and their families;
    (C) Inservice and preservice training of personnel to work with 
infants, toddlers, children, and youth with disabilities and their 
families;
    (D) Inservice and preservice training of personnel to work with 
minority infants, toddlers, children, and youth with disabilities, and 
their families;
    (E) Preservice and inservice training of special education and 
related services personnel in instructive and assistive technology to 
benefit infants, toddlers, children, and youth with disabilities; and
    (F) Recruitment and retention of special education, related 
services, and early intervention personnel.
    (ii) Both inservice and preservice training must include a component 
that addresses the coordination among all service providers, including 
regular educators.
    (6) Professional development partnerships. This priority, listed in 
Sec. 318.10(a)(4), supports the formation of consortia or partnerships 
of public and private entities for the purpose of providing 
opportunities for career advancement or competency-based training, 
including but not limited to certificate- or degree-granting programs in 
special education, related services, and early intervention for current 
workers at public and private agencies that provide services to infants, 
toddlers, children, and youth with disabilities. Activities authorized 
under this priority include, but are not limited to, the following:
    (i) Establishing a program with colleges and universities to develop 
creative new programs and coursework options or to expand existing 
programs in the field of special education, related services, or early 
intervention. Funds may be used to provide release time for faculty and 
staff for curriculum development, instructional costs, and modest start-
up and other program development costs.
    (ii) Establishing a career development mentoring program using 
faculty and professional staff members of participating agencies as role 
models, career sponsors, and academic advisors for experienced State, 
city, county, and voluntary sector workers who have demonstrated a 
commitment to working in these fields and who are enrolled in higher 
education institution programs relating to these fields.
    (iii) Supporting a wide range of programmatic and research 
activities aimed at increasing opportunities for career advancement and 
competency-based training in these fields.
    (iv) Identifying existing public agency, private agency, and labor 
union personnel policies and benefit programs that may facilitate the 
ability of workers to take advantage of higher

[[Page 182]]

education opportunities such as leave time and tuition reimbursement.
    (7) Technical assistance to professional development partnerships. 
This priority, listed in Sec. 318.10(a)(5), supports technical 
assistance to States or entities receiving awards under professional 
development partnership projects. Activities must include, but are not 
limited to, the following:
    (i) Identifying the specific technical assistance needs of 
individual projects.
    (ii) Conducting annual meetings at the national level.
    (iii) Identifying other projects under the Act related to 
professional development for the purpose of coordinating professional 
development projects. Coordination activities may include conferences, 
publications, and maintenance of documents and data relevant to the 
activities of the professional development projects.
    (iv) Cooperating with other projects and organizations on common 
goals.
    (v) Disseminating information through media, newsletters, computers, 
and written documentation.
    (vi) Evaluating center activities, including impact determination, 
and evaluation assistance to centers.
    (8) Utilizing innovative recruitment and retention strategies. This 
priority supports projects to develop emerging and creative sources of 
supply of personnel with degrees and certification in appropriate 
disciplines, and innovative strategies related to recruitment and 
retention of personnel.
    (9) Promoting full qualifications for personnel serving infants, 
toddlers, children, and youth with disabilities. This priority supports 
projects designed specifically to train personnel who are working with 
less than full certification or outside their field of specialization, 
to assist them in becoming fully qualified. The following are 
appropriate under this priority: student incentives; extension, summer, 
and evening programs; internships; alternative certification plans; and 
other innovative practices.
    (10) Training personnel to serve low incidence disabilities. This 
priority supports projects to train teachers of children with visual 
impairments including blindness, hearing impairments including deafness, 
orthopedic impairments, other health impairments, autism, traumatic 
brain injury, and severe and multiple disabilities.
    (11) Training personnel to work in rural areas. This priority 
supports projects to train personnel to serve infants, toddlers, 
children, and youth with disabilities in rural areas. Projects, 
including curricula, procedures, practica, and innovative use of 
technology, must be designed to provide training to assist personnel to 
work with parents, teachers, and administrators in these special 
environments. Special strategies must be designed to recruit personnel 
from rural areas who will most likely return to those areas.
    (12) Training personnel to provide transition assistance from school 
to adult roles. This priority supports projects for preparation of 
personnel who assist youth with disabilities in their transition from 
school to adult roles. Personnel may be prepared to provide short-term 
transition services, long-term structured employment services, or 
instruction in community and school settings with secondary school 
students. It is especially important that preparation of transition 
personnel include training in instructional and assistive technology.
    (13) Preparation of paraprofessionals. This priority supports 
projects for the preparation of paraprofessionals. This includes 
programs to train teacher aids, job coaches, interpreters, therapy 
assistants, and other personnel who provide support to professional 
staff in delivery of services to infants, toddlers, children, and youth 
with disabilities.
    (14) Improving services for minorities. This priority supports 
projects to prepare personnel to serve infants, toddlers, children, and 
youth with disabilities who, because of minority status, require that 
personnel obtain professional competencies in addition to those needed 
to teach other children with similar disabilities. Projects funded under 
this priority must focus on specific minority populations, determine the 
additional competencies that are needed by professionals serving those 
populations, and develop those competencies.
    (15) Training minorities and individuals with disabilities. This 
priority supports projects to recruit and prepare minority individuals 
and individuals with

[[Page 183]]

disabilities for careers in special education, related services, and 
early intervention.
    (16) Minority institutions. This priority supports awards to 
Historically Black Colleges and Universities and other institutions of 
higher education whose minority student enrollment is at least 25 
percent. Awards may provide training of personnel in all areas noted in 
Sec. 318.10(a) (1) and (2), and must be designed to increase the 
capabilities of the institution in appropriate training areas.
    (17) Preparing personnel to meet the National Education Goals. This 
priority supports projects that develop or expand innovative preservice 
and inservice training programs that are designed to provide personnel 
serving children with disabilities with skills that are needed to help 
schools meet the National Education Goals. These programs must promote 
the following:
    (i) Increased collaboration among providers of special education, 
regular education, bilingual education, migrant education, and 
vocational education, and among public and private agencies and 
institutions.
    (ii) Improved coordination of services among health and social 
services agencies and within communities regarding services for children 
with disabilities and their families.
    (iii) Increased systematic parental involvement in the education of 
their children with disabilities.
    (iv) Inclusion of children with disabilities in all aspects of 
education and society.
    (v) Training that is designed to enable special education teachers

developed by the National Council on Teachers of Mathematics) as those 
standards are developed.
    (18) Training educational interpreters. This priority supports 
projects for the establishment or continuation of educational 
interpreter training programs to train personnel to effectively meet the 
various communication needs of elementary and secondary students who are 
deaf or deaf-blind. These programs may also provide for the training or 
retraining (including short-term and inservice training) of regular 
education teachers who are involved in providing instruction to 
individuals who are deaf, but who are not certified as teachers of such 
individuals, and other personnel who work with such individuals, on the 
role of educational interpreters.
    (19) Attention deficit disorders. This priority supports projects to 
devise new inservice and preservice training strategies for special 
education and regular classroom teachers and administrators to address 
the needs of children with attention deficit disorders (ADD). The 
purpose is not to develop distinct categorical programs for training 
personnel to teach children with ADD, but rather to enhance the skills 
of general and special education teachers and administrators to better 
serve this population of students. These strategies must be infused into 
personnel preparation programs of national organizations serving regular 
and special education personnel.
    (20) Regional model demonstration training programs on deafness and 
secondary disabilities. This priority supports regional model 
demonstration training programs on deafness and secondary disabilities. 
These programs shall provide preservice and inservice training to 
teachers, school administrators, leadership personnel, and related 
services personnel in the education of students with deafness.
    (21) Training regular educators who serve students with deafness. 
This priority supports projects to provide for the training or 
retraining of regular education teachers who are involved in providing 
instruction to individuals who are deaf, but who are not certified as 
teachers of such individuals, to meet the communication needs of such 
individuals.
    (b) Under paragraph (a) of this section, the Secretary may identify 
an amount of funds to be set aside for projects to address the needs of 
children with particular disabilities and in particular States or 
geographic areas. Decisions to implement this paragraph would be based 
on review of each State's comprehensive systems of personnel 
development, special studies, and other information.

these will differ from the current services and current delivery system;
    (9) Identify all relevant barriers to implementing the proposed 
statewide changes and identify and propose appropriate strategies for

Sec. 345.62  How does a State redesignate the lead agency when it is subject to corrective action?

    (a) Once a State becomes subject to a corrective action plan under 
Sec. 345.60, the Governor of the State, subject to approval by the 
Secretary, shall appoint, within 30 days after the submission of the 
plan to the Secretary, a monitoring panel consisting of the following 
representatives:
    (1) The head of the lead agency designated by the Governor;
    (2) Two representatives from different public or private nonprofit 
organizations that represent the interests of individuals with 
disabilities;
    (3) Two consumers who are users of assistive technology devices and 
assistive technology services and who are not--
    (i) Members of the advisory council, if any, of the consumer-
responsive comprehensive statewide program of technology-related 
assistance; or
    (ii) Employees of the State lead agency; and

regarding progress in implementing the corrective action plan and shall 
have the authority to request additional information necessary to 
determine compliance.
    (d) The meetings of the panel to determine compliance shall be open 
to the public (subject to confidentiality concerns) and held at 
locations that are accessible to individuals with disabilities.
    (e) The panel shall carry out the duties of the panel for the entire 
period of the corrective action plan, as determined by the Secretary.
    (f) A failure by a Governor of a State to comply with the 
requirements of paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section results in 
the termination of funding for the State under this part.
    (g) Based on its findings, a monitoring panel may determine that a 
lead agency designated by a Governor has not accomplished the purposes 
described in Sec. 345.2(a) and that there is good cause for 
redesignation of the agency and the temporary loss of funds by the State 
under this part.
    (h) For the purposes of this section, ``good cause'' includes the 
following:
    (1) Lack of progress with employment of qualified staff;

    (a) The Governor of a State, based on input from individuals with 
disabilities and their family members, guardians, advocates, or 
authorized representatives, may determine that the entity providing 
protection and advocacy services has not met the protection and advocacy 
service needs of the individuals with disabilities and their family 
members, guardians, advocates, or authorized representatives, for 
securing funding for and access to assistive technology devices and 
assistive technology services, and that there is good cause to provide 
the protection and advocacy services for the State through a contract 
with a second entity.
    (b) On making the determination in paragraph (a) of this section, 
the Governor may not enter into a contract with a second entity to 
provide the protection and advocacy services unless good cause exists 
and unless--
    (1) The Governor has given the first entity 30 days notice of the 
intention to enter into the contract, including specification of good 
cause, and an opportunity to respond to the assertion that good cause 
has been shown;
    (2) Individuals with disabilities and their family members, 
guardians, advocates, or authorized representatives, have timely notice 
of the determination and opportunity for public comment; and
    (3) The first entity has the opportunity to appeal the determination 
to the Secretary within 30 days of the determination on the basis that 
there is not good cause to enter into the contract.
    (c)(1) When the Governor of a State determines that there is good 
cause to enter into a contract with a second entity to provide the 
protection and advocacy services, the Governor shall hold an open 
competition within the State and issue a request for proposals by 
entities desiring to provide the services.
    (2) The Governor shall not issue a request for proposals by entities 
desiring to provide protection and advocacy services until the first 
entity has been given notice and an opportunity to respond. If the first 
entity appeals the determination to the Secretary, the Governor shall 
issue such request only if the Secretary decides not to overturn the 
determination of the Governor. The Governor shall issue such request 
within 30 days after the end of the period during which the first entity 
has the opportunity to respond, or after the decision of the Secretary, 
as appropriate.
    (3) The competition shall be open to entities with the same 
expertise and ability to provide legal services as a system in 
Sec. 345.30(b)(12). The competition shall ensure public involvement, 
including a public hearing and adequate opportunity for public comment.

Sec. 361.22  Cooperation with agencies responsible for students with disabilities.

    (a) Students with disabilities who are receiving special education 
services--(1) General. The State plan must contain plans, policies, and 
procedures that are designed to facilitate the transition of students 
who are receiving special education services from the provision of a 
free appropriate public education under the responsibility of an 
educational agency to the provision of vocational rehabilitation 
services under the responsibility of the designated State unit. These 
plans, policies, and procedures must provide for the development and 
completion of the IWRP before the student leaves the school setting for 
each student determined to be eligible for vocational rehabilitation 
services or, if the designated State unit is operating under an order of 
selection, for each eligible student able to be served under the order. 
The IWRP must, at a minimum, identify the long-term rehabilitation 
goals, intermediate rehabilitation objectives, and goals and objectives 
related to enabling the student to live independently, to the extent 
these goals and objectives are included in the student's individualized 
education program.
    (2) Formal interagency agreement. The State plan must assure that 
the State unit enters into formal interagency agreements with the State 
educational agency and, as appropriate, with local educational agencies, 
that are responsible for the free appropriate public education of 
students with disabilities who are receiving special education services. 
Formal interagency agreements must, at a minimum, identify--
    (i) Policies, practices, and procedures that can be coordinated 
between the agencies, including definitions, standards for eligibility, 
policies and procedures for making referrals, procedures for outreach to 
and identification of youth who are receiving special education services 
and are in need of transition services, and procedures and timeframes 
for evaluation and follow-up of those students;
    (ii) The roles of each agency, including provisions for determining 
State lead agencies and qualified personnel responsible for transition 
services;
    (iii) Procedures for providing training for staff of State and local 
educational agencies as to the availability, benefits of, and 
eligibility standards for vocational rehabilitation services, to the 
extent practicable;
    (iv) Available resources, including sources of funds for the 
development and expansion of services;
    (v) The financial responsibility of each agency in providing 
services to students with disabilities who are receiving special 
education services, consistent with State law;
    (vi) Procedures for resolving disputes between the agencies that are 
parties to the agreement; and
    (vii) All other components necessary to ensure meaningful 
cooperation among agencies, including procedures

[[Page 310]]

to facilitate the development of local teams to coordinate the provision 
of services to individuals, sharing data, and coordinating joint 
training of staff in the provision of transition services.
    (b) Students with disabilities who are not receiving special 
education services. The State plan must contain plans, policies, and 
procedures, including cooperation with appropriate agencies, designed to 
ensure that students with disabilities who are not receiving special 
education services have access to and can receive vocational 
rehabilitation services, if appropriate, and to ensure outreach to and 
identification of those students.

29 U.S.C. 721 (a)(11), (a)(24), and (a)(30))


    Note: The following excerpt from page 33 of Senate Report No. 102-
357 further clarifies the provision of transition services by the State 
vocational rehabilitation agency:

The overall purpose of this provision is to ensure that all students who 
require vocational rehabilitation services receive those services in a 
timely manner. There should be no gap in services between the education 
system and the vocational rehabilitation system * * *. The committee 
intends that students with disabilities who are eligible for, and who 
need, vocational rehabilitation services will receive those services as 
soon as possible, consistent with Federal and State law. These 
provisions are not intended in any way to shift the responsibility of 
service delivery from education to rehabilitation during the transition 
years. School officials will continue to be responsible for providing a 
free and appropriate public education as defined by the IEP. The role of 
the rehabilitation system is primarily one of planning for the student's 
years after leaving school. (S. Rep. No. 357, 102d Cong., 2d. Sess. 33 
(1992))


<R05>
Sec. 361.23  Cooperation with other public agencies.

    (a) Coordination of services with vocational education and Javits-
Wagner-O'Day programs. The State plan must assure that specific 
arrangements or agreements are made for the coordination of services for 
any individual who is eligible for vocational rehabilitation services 
and is also eligible for services under the Carl D. Perkins Vocational 
and Applied Technology Education Act or the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act.
    (b) Cooperation with other Federal, State, and local public agencies 
providing services related to the rehabilitation of individuals with 
disabilities. (1) The State plan must assure that the State unit 
cooperates with other Federal, State, and local public agencies 
providing services related to the rehabilitation of individuals with 
disabilities, including, as appropriate, establishing interagency 
working groups or entering into formal interagency cooperative 
agreements with, and using the services and facilities of--
    (i) Federal agencies providing services related to the 
rehabilitation of individuals with disabilities, including the Social 
Security Administration, the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs of 
the Department of Labor, and the Department of Veterans Affairs; and
    (ii) State and local public agencies providing services related to 
the rehabilitation of individuals with disabilities, including State and 
local public agencies administering the State's social services and 
financial assistance programs and other State programs for individuals 
with disabilities, such as the State's developmental disabilities 
program, veterans programs, health and mental health programs, education 
programs (including adult education, higher education, and vocational 
education programs), workers' compensation programs, job training and 
placement programs, and public employment offices.
    (2) Interagency cooperation under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, 
to the extent practicable, must provide for training for staff of the 
agencies as to the availability, benefits of, and eligibility standards 
for vocational rehabilitation services.
    (3) If the State unit chooses to enter into formal interagency 
cooperative agreements developed under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, 
the agreements must--
    (i) Identify policies, practices, and procedures that can be 
coordinated among the agencies (particularly definitions, standards for 
eligibility, the joint sharing and use of evaluations

[[Page 311]]

and assessments, and procedures for making referrals);
    (ii) Identify available resources and define the financial 
responsibility of each agency for paying for necessary services 
(consistent with State law) and procedures for resolving disputes 
between agencies; and
    (iii) Include all additional components necessary to ensure 
meaningful cooperation and coordination.
    (c) Reciprocal referral services with a separate agency for 
individuals who are blind. If there is a separate State unit for 
individuals who are blind, the State plan must assure that the two State 
units establish reciprocal referral services, use each other's services 
and facilities to the extent feasible, jointly plan activities to 
improve services in the State for individuals with multiple impairments, 
including visual impairments, and otherwise cooperate to provide more 
effective services, including, if appropriate, entering into a written 
cooperative agreement.

rehabilitation services with another State agency or a local public 
agency that is furnishing part or all of the non-Federal share, the 
State plan must assure that--
    (1) The services provided by the cooperating agency are not the

paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section must include a statement that, 
during the current fiscal year and the preceding fiscal year, the DSU 
has in fact--
    (i) Provided assessment services to all applicants and the full 
range of services, as appropriate, to all eligible individuals;
    (ii) Made referral forms widely available throughout the State;
    (iii) Conducted outreach efforts to identify and serve individuals 
with disabilities who have been unserved or underserved by the 
vocational rehabilitation system; and
    (iv) Not delayed, through waiting lists or other means, 
determinations of eligibility, the development of individualized written 
rehabilitation programs (IWRPs) for individuals determined eligible, or 
the provision of services for eligible individuals for whom IWRPs have 
been developed.
    (3) For those designated State units unable to provide the full 
range of services to all eligible individuals during the current or 
preceding fiscal year, or unable to provide the statement required in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the explanation required by paragraph 
(a)(1)(i) of this section must include--
    (i) A description of the circumstances that have changed that will 
allow the DSU to meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this 
section in the next fiscal year, including a description of--
    (A) The estimated number of and projected costs of serving, in the 
next fiscal year, individuals with existing IWRPs;
    (B) The projected number of individuals with disabilities who will 
apply for services and will be determined eligible in the next fiscal 
year and the projected costs of serving those individuals;
    (C) The projected costs of administering the program in the next 
fiscal year, including, but not limited to, costs of staff salaries and 
benefits, outreach activities, and required statewide studies; and
    (D) The projected revenues and projected number of qualified 
personnel for the program in the next fiscal year;
    (ii) Comparable data, as relevant, for the current or preceding 
fiscal year, or for both years, of the costs listed in paragraphs 
(a)(3)(i) (A) through (C) of

[[Page 316]]

this section and the resources identified in paragraph (a)(3)(i)(D) of 
this section and an explanation of any projected increases or decreases 
in these costs and resources; and
    (iii) A demonstration that the projected revenues and the projected 
number of qualified personnel for the program in the next fiscal year 
are adequate to cover the costs identified in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) (A) 
through (C) of this section so as to ensure the provision of the full 
range of services, as appropriate, to all eligible individuals.
    (b) Time for determining need for an order of selection. (1) The 
designated State unit shall determine, prior to the beginning of each 
fiscal year, whether to establish and implement an order of selection.
    (2) If the designated State unit determines that it does not need to 
establish an order of selection, it shall reevaluate this determination 
whenever changed circumstances during the course of a fiscal year, such 
as a decrease in its fiscal or personnel resources or an increase in its 
program costs, indicate that it may no longer be able to provide the 
full range of services, as appropriate, to all eligible individuals.
    (c) Establishing an order of selection--(1) Basis for order of 
selection. An order of selection must be based on a refinement of the 
three criteria in the definition of ``individual with a severe 
disability'' in section 7(15)(A) of the Act.
    (2) Factors that cannot be used in determining order of selection of 
eligible individuals. An order of selection may not be based on any 
other factors, including--
    (i) Any duration of residency requirement, provided the individual 
is present in the State;
    (ii) Type of disability;
    (iii) Age, gender, race, color, creed, or national origin;
    (iv) Source of referral;
    (v) Type of expected employment outcome;
    (vi) The need for specific services or anticipated cost of services 
required by an individual; or
    (vii) The income level of an individual or an individual's family.
    (3) Priority for individuals with the most severe disabilities. The 
State plan must assure that those individuals with the most severe 
disabilities are selected for service before other individuals with 
disabilities. The designated State unit shall establish criteria for 
determining which individuals are individuals with the most severe 
disabilities. The criteria must be consistent with the definition of 
``individual with a severe disability'' in section 7(15)(A) of the Act 
and the requirements in paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section.
    (d) Administrative requirements. In administering the order of 
selection, the designated State unit shall--
    (1) Implement the order of selection on a statewide basis;
    (2) Notify all eligible individuals of the priority categories in a 
State's order of selection, their assignment to a particular category, 
and their right to appeal their category assignment;
    (3) Continue to provide all needed services to any eligible 
individual who has begun to receive services under an IWRP prior to the 
effective date of the order of selection, irrespective of the severity 
of the individual's disability;
    (4) Ensure that its funding arrangements for providing services 
under the State plan, including third-party arrangements and awards 
under the establishment authority, are consistent with the order of 
selection. If any funding arrangements are inconsistent with the order 
of selection, the designated State unit shall renegotiate these funding 
arrangements so that they are consistent with the order of selection.
    (e) State Rehabilitation Advisory Council. The designated State unit 
shall consult with and seriously consider the advice of the State 
Rehabilitation Advisory Council regarding the--
    (1) Need to establish an order of selection, including any 
reevaluation of the need under paragraph (b)(2) of this section;
    (2) Priority categories of the particular order of selection;
    (3) Criteria for determining individuals with the most severe 
disabilities; and

an expanded information and referral program that includes counseling, 
guidance, and referral for job placements for those eligible individuals 
who are not in the priority category or categories to receive vocational 
rehabilitation services under the State's order of selection.
    (1) If a State unit elects to establish an expanded information and 
referral program under paragraph (c) of this section, the State plan 
must include--
    (i) A description of how the expanded information and referral 
program will be established and how it will function, including the 
level of commitment of State unit staff and resources; and
    (ii) An assurance that, in carrying out this program, the State unit 
will not use funds that are needed to provide vocational rehabilitation 
services under IWRPs for eligible individuals in the priority category 
or categories receiving services under the State unit's order of 
selection or for other eligible individuals who have begun to receive 
services prior to the effective date of the order of selection.
    (2) If the designated State unit chooses to track the individuals 
who obtain employment through participation in an expanded information 
and referral program established under paragraph (c) of this section, 
the State plan must include a report of the number of individuals served 
and the number of individuals who obtain employment through this 
program.

    (b) State program use. All personal information in the possession of 
the State agency or the designated State unit must be used only for the 
purposes directly connected with the administration of the vocational 
rehabilitation program. Information containing identifiable personal 
information may not be shared with advisory or other bodies that do not 
have official responsibility for administration of the program. In the 
administration of the program, the State unit may obtain personal

individual's representative in a timely manner.
    (2) Medical, psychological, or other information that the State unit 
determines may be harmful to the individual may not be released directly 
to the individual, but must be provided to the individual through a 
third party chosen by the individual, which may include, among others, 
an advocate, a family member, or a qualified medical or mental health 
professional, unless a representative has been appointed by a court to 
represent the individual, in which case the information must be released 
to the court-appointed representative.
    (3) If personal information has been obtained from another agency or

established by, the other agency or organization.
    (4) An applicant or eligible individual who believes that 
information in the individual's record of services is inaccurate or 
misleading may request that the designated State unit amend the 
information. If the information is not amended, the request for an 
amendment must be documented in the record of services.
    (d) Release for audit, evaluation, and research. Personal 
information may be released to an organization, agency, or individual 
engaged in audit, evaluation, or research only for purposes directly 
connected with the administration of the vocational rehabilitation 
program, or for purposes that would significantly improve the quality of 
life for applicants and eligible individuals and only if the 
organization, agency, or individual assures that--
    (1) The information will be used only for the purposes for which it 
is being provided;
    (2) The information will be released only to persons officially 
connected with the audit, evaluation, or research;
    (3) The information will not be released to the involved individual;
    (4) The information will be managed in a manner to safeguard

[[Page 319]]

    (5) The final product will not reveal any personal identifying 
information without the informed written consent of the involved 
individual or the individual's representative.
    (e) Release to other programs or authorities. (1) Upon receiving the 
informed written consent of the individual or, if appropriate, the 
individual's representative, the State unit may release personal 
information to another agency or organization for its program purposes 
only to the extent that the information may be released to the involved 
individual or the individual's representative and only to the extent 
that the other agency or organization demonstrates that the information 
requested is necessary for its program.
    (2) Medical or psychological information that the State unit 
determines may be harmful to the individual may be released if the other 
agency or organization assures the State unit that the information will 
be used only for the purpose for which it is being provided and will not 
be further released to the individual.
    (3) The State unit shall release personal information if required by 
Federal law or regulations.
    (4) The State unit shall release personal information in response to 
investigations in connection with law enforcement, fraud, or abuse, 
unless expressly prohibited by Federal or State laws or regulations, and 
in response to an order issued by a judge, magistrate, or other

equitable handling of referrals of individuals for vocational 
rehabilitation services. The standards must include timelines for making 
good faith efforts to inform these individuals of application 
requirements and to gather information necessary to initiate an 
assessment for determining eligibility and priority for services.
    (b) Applications. (1) The State plan must assure that once an 
individual has submitted an application for vocational rehabilitation 
services, an eligibility determination will be made within 60 days, 
unless--
    (i) Exceptional and unforeseen circumstances beyond the control of 
the agency preclude a determination within 60 days and the agency and 
the individual agree to a specific extension of time; or
    (ii) An extended evaluation is necessary, in accordance with 
Sec. 361.42(d).
    (2) An individual is considered to have submitted an application 
when the individual or the individual's representative, as 
appropriate,--
    (i) Has completed and signed an agency application form or has 
otherwise requested services;

[[Page 320]]

    (ii) Has provided information necessary to initiate an assessment to 
determine eligibility and priority for services; and
    (iii) Is available to complete the assessment process.
    (3) The designated State unit shall ensure that its application 
forms are widely available throughout the State.

<R05>
Sec. 361.42  Assessment for determining eligibility and priority for services.

    The State plan must assure that, in order to determine whether an 
individual is eligible for vocational rehabilitation services and the 
individual's priority under an order of selection for services (if the 
State is operating under an order of selection), the designated State 
unit will conduct an assessment for determining eligibility and priority 
for services. The assessment must be conducted in the most integrated 
setting possible, consistent with the individual's needs and informed 
choice, and in accordance with the following provisions:
    (a) Eligibility requirements--(1) Basic requirements. The State plan 
must assure that the State unit's determination of an applicant's 
eligibility for vocational rehabilitation services is based only on the 
following requirements:
    (i) A determination that the applicant has a physical or mental 
impairment.
    (ii) A determination that the applicant's physical or mental 
impairment constitutes or results in a substantial impediment to 
employment for the applicant.
    (iii) A presumption, in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section, that the applicant can benefit in terms of an employment 
outcome from the provision of vocational rehabilitation services.
    (iv) A determination that the applicant requires vocational 
rehabilitation services to prepare for, enter into, engage in, or retain 
gainful employment consistent with the applicant's strengths, resources, 
priorities, concerns, abilities, capabilities, and informed choice.
    (2) Presumption of benefit. The State plan must assure that the 
designated State unit will presume that an applicant who meets the 
eligibility requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) (i) and (ii) of this 
section can benefit in terms of an employment outcome unless it 
demonstrates, based on clear and convincing evidence, that the applicant 
is incapable of benefitting in terms of an employment outcome from 
vocational rehabilitation services.
    (3) Limited presumption for Social Security beneficiaries. The State 
plan must assure that, if an applicant has appropriate evidence, such as 
an award letter, that establishes the applicant's eligibility for Social 
Security benefits under title II or title XVI of the Social Security 
Act, the designated State unit will presume that the applicant--
    (i) Meets the eligibility requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) (i) and 
(ii) of this section; and
    (ii) Has a severe physical or mental impairment that seriously 
limits one or more functional capacities in terms of an employment 
outcome.
    (b) Prohibited factors. The State plan must assure that--
    (1) No duration of residence requirement is imposed that excludes 
from services any applicant who is present in the State;
    (2) No applicant or group of applicants is excluded or found 
ineligible solely on the basis of the type of disability;
    (3) The eligibility requirements are applied without regard to the 
age, gender, race, color, creed, or national origin of the applicant; 
and
    (4) The eligibility requirements are applied without regard to the 
particular service needs or anticipated cost of services required by an 
applicant or the income level of an applicant or applicant's family.
    (c) Review and assessment of data for eligibility determination. 
Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the designated 
State unit shall base its determination of each of the basic eligibility 
requirements in paragraph (a) of this section on--
    (1) A review and assessment of existing data, including counselor 
observations, education records, information

[[Page 321]]

provided by the individual or the individual's family, information used 
by the Social Security Administration, and determinations made by 
officials of other agencies; and
    (2) To the extent existing data do not describe the current 
functioning of the individual or are unavailable, insufficient, or 
inappropriate to make an eligibility determination, an assessment of 
additional data resulting from the provision of vocational 
rehabilitation services, including assistive technology devices and 
services and worksite assessments, that are necessary to determine 
whether an individual is eligible.
    (d) Extended evaluation for individuals with severe disabilities. 
(1) Prior to any determination that an individual with a severe 
disability is incapable of benefitting from vocational rehabilitation 
services in terms of an employment outcome because of the severity of 
that individual's disability, the State unit shall conduct an extended 
evaluation to determine whether or not there is clear and convincing 
evidence to support such a determination.
    (2) During the extended evaluation period, which may not exceed 18 
months, vocational rehabilitation services must be provided in the most 
integrated setting possible, consistent with the informed choice of the 
individual.
    (3) During the extended evaluation period, the State unit shall 
develop a written plan for determining eligibility and for determining 
the nature and scope of services required to achieve an employment 
outcome. The State unit may provide during this period only those 
services that are necessary to make these two determinations.
    (4) The State unit shall assess the individual's progress as 
frequently as necessary, but at least once every 90 days, during the 
extended evaluation period.
    (5) The State unit shall terminate extended evaluation services at 
any point during the 18-month extended evaluation period if the State 
unit determines that--
    (i) There is sufficient evidence to conclude that the individual can 
benefit from the provision of vocational rehabilitation services in 
terms of an employment outcome; or
    (ii) There is clear and convincing evidence that the individual is 
incapable of benefiting from vocational rehabilitation services in terms 
of an employment outcome.
    (e) Data for determination of priority for services under an order 
of selection. If the State unit is operating under an order of selection 
for services, as provided in Sec. 361.36, the State unit shall base its 
priority assignments on--
    (1) A review of the data that was developed under paragraphs (c) and 
(d) of this section to make the eligibility determination; and
    (2) An assessment of additional data, to the extent necessary.

(Authority: Secs. 7(22)(A)(ii), 7(22)(C)(iii), 101(a)(9)(A), 101(a)(14), 
101(a)(31), 102(a)(1), 102(a)(2), 102(a)(3), 102(a)(4), 103(a)(4), and

722(a)(4), 723(a)(4), and 723(a)(6))


    Note: Clear and convincing evidence means that the designated State 
unit shall have a high degree of certainty before it can conclude that 
an individual is incapable of benefiting from services in terms of an 
employment outcome. The ``clear and convincing'' standard constitutes 
the highest standard used in our civil system of law and is to be 
individually applied on a case-by-case basis. The term clear means 
unequivocal. Given these requirements, a review of existing information 
generally would not provide clear and convincing evidence. For example, 
the use of an intelligence test result alone would not constitute clear 
and convincing evidence. Clear and convincing evidence might include a 
description of assessments, including situational assessments and 
supported employment assessments, from service providers who have 
concluded that they would be unable to meet the individual's needs due 
to the severity of the individual's disability. The demonstration of 
``clear and convincing evidence'' must include, if appropriate, a 
functional assessment of skill development activities, with any 
necessary supports (including assistive technology), in real life 
settings. (S. Rep. No. 357, 102d Cong., 2d. Sess. 37-38 (1992))


<R05>
Sec. 361.43  Procedures for ineligibility determination.

    The State plan must assure that if the State unit determines that an 
applicant is ineligible for vocational rehabilitation services or 
determines that an individual receiving services

[[Page 322]]

under an individualized written rehabilitation program is no longer 
eligible for services, the State unit shall--
    (a) Make the determination only after providing an opportunity for 
full consultation with the individual or, as appropriate, with the 
individual's representative;
    (b) Inform the individual in writing, supplemented as necessary by 
other appropriate modes of communication consistent with the informed 
choice of the individual, of the ineligibility determination, including 
the reasons for that determination, the requirements under this section, 
and the means by which the individual may express and seek remedy for 
any dissatisfaction, including the procedures for review of a 
determination by the rehabilitation counselor or coordinator in 
accordance with Sec. 361.57;
    (c) Provide the individual with a description of services available 
from a client assistance program established under 34 CFR part 370 and 
information on how to contact that program; and
    (d) Review within 12 months and annually thereafter if requested by 
the individual or, if appropriate, by the individual's representative 
any ineligibility determination that is based on a finding that the 
individual is incapable of achieving an employment outcome. This review 
need not be conducted in situations in which the individual has refused 
it, the individual is no longer present in the State, the individual's 
whereabouts are unknown, or the individual's medical condition is 
rapidly progressive or terminal.

<R05>
Sec. 361.44  Closure without eligibility determination.

    The State plan must assure that the State unit may not close an 
applicant's record of services prior to making an eligibility 
determination unless the applicant declines to participate in, or is 
unavailable to complete an assessment for determining eligibility and 
priority for services, and the State unit has made a reasonable number 
of attempts to contact the applicant or, if appropriate, the applicant's 
representative to encourage the applicant's participation.

and 721(a)(6))


<R05>
Sec. 361.45  Development of the individualized written rehabilitation program.

    (a) Purpose. The State plan must assure that the State unit conducts 
an assessment for determining vocational rehabilitation needs for each 
eligible individual or, if the State is operating under an order of 
selection, for each eligible individual to whom the State is able to 
provide services. The purpose of this assessment is to determine the 
long-term vocational goal, intermediate rehabilitation objectives, and 
the nature and scope of vocational rehabilitation services to be 
included in the IWRP, which must be designed to achieve an employment 
outcome that is consistent with the individual's unique strengths, 
priorities, concerns, abilities, capabilities, career interests, and 
informed choice.
    (b) Procedural requirements. The State plan must assure that--
    (1) The IWRP is developed jointly, agreed to, and signed by the 
vocational rehabilitation counselor or coordinator and the individual 
or, as appropriate, the individual's representative within the framework 
of a counseling and guidance relationship;
    (2) The State unit has established and implemented standards for the 
prompt development of IWRPs for the individuals identified under 
paragraph (a) of this section, including timelines that take into

other nonprofit community rehabilitation program that is used to provide 
services that promote integration and competitive employment, including 
under special circumstances, the construction of a facility for a public 
or nonprofit community rehabilitation program. Examples of ``special 
circumstances'' include the destruction by natural disaster of the only 
available center serving an area or a State determination that 
construction is necessary in a rural area because no other public 
agencies or private nonprofit organizations are currently able to 
provide services to individuals.

[[Page 327]]

    (2) Telecommunications systems that have the potential for 
substantially improving vocational rehabilitation service delivery 
methods and developing appropriate programming to meet the particular

individuals with the most severe disabilities under the supervision of 
the State unit, including enterprises established under the Randolph-
Sheppard program, management services and supervision, acquisition of 
equipment, initial stocks and supplies, and initial operating expenses, 
in accordance with the following requirements:
    (i) ``Management services and supervision'' includes inspection, 
quality control, consultation, accounting, regulating, in-service 
training, and related services provided on a systematic basis to support 
and improve small business enterprises operated by individuals with the 
most severe disabilities. ``Management services and supervision'' may be

to the establishment of a new business enterprise during the initial 
establishment period, which may not exceed six months.
    (iii) Costs of establishing a small business enterprise may include 
operational costs during the initial establishment period, which may not

will be selected to participate in this supervised program.
    (v) If the State plan provides for these services and the State unit 
chooses to set aside funds from the proceeds of the operation of the 
small business enterprises, the State plan also must assure that the 
State unit maintains a description of the methods used in setting aside 
funds and the purposes for which funds are set aside. Funds may be used 
only for small business enterprises purposes, and benefits that are 
provided to operators from set-aside funds must be provided on an 
equitable basis.
    (6) Other services that promise to contribute substantially to the 
rehabilitation of a group of individuals but that are not related 
directly to the IWRP of any one individual. Examples of those other 
services might include the purchase or lease of a bus to provide 
transportation to a group of applicants or eligible individuals or the 
purchase of equipment or instructional materials that would benefit a 
group of applicants or eligible individuals.
    (b) If the State plan provides for vocational rehabilitation 
services for groups of individuals, the State plan must assure that the 
designated State unit--
    (1) Develops and maintains written policies covering the nature and 
scope of each of the vocational rehabilitation services it provides and 
the criteria under which each service is provided; and
    (2) Maintains information to ensure the proper and efficient 
administration of those services in the form and detail and at the time 
required by the Secretary, including the types of services provided, the

    The State plan must assure that the State unit develops and 
maintains written policies covering the nature and scope of each of the 
vocational rehabilitation services specified in Sec. 361.48 and the 
criteria under which each service is provided. The policies must ensure 
that the provision of services is based on the rehabilitation needs of 
each individual as identified in that individual's IWRP and is 
consistent with the individual's informed choice. The written policies 
may not establish any arbitrary limits on the nature and scope of 
vocational rehabilitation services to be provided to the individual to 
achieve an employment outcome. The policies must be developed in 
accordance with the following provisions:
    (a) Out-of-State services. (1) The State unit may establish a 
preference for in-State services, provided that the preference does not 
effectively deny an individual a necessary service. If the individual 
chooses an out-of-State service at a higher cost than an in-State 
service, if either service would meet the individual's rehabilitation 
needs, the designated State unit is not responsible for those costs in 
excess of the cost of the in-State service.
    (2) The State unit may not establish policies that effectively 
prohibit the provision of out-of-State services.
    (b) Payment for services. (1) The State unit shall establish and 
maintain written policies to govern the rates of payment for all 
purchased vocational rehabilitation services.
    (2) The State unit may establish a fee schedule designed to ensure a 
reasonable cost to the program for each service, provided that the 
schedule is--
    (i) Not so low as to effectively deny an individual a necessary 
service; and
    (ii) Not absolute and permits exceptions so that individual needs 
can be addressed.
    (3) The State unit may not place absolute dollar limits on specific 
service categories or on the total services provided to an individual.
    (c) Duration of services. (1) The State unit may establish 
reasonable time periods for the provision of services provided that the 
time periods are--
    (i) Not so short as to effectively deny an individual a necessary 
service; and
    (ii) Not absolute and permit exceptions so that individual needs can 
be addressed.
    (2) The State unit may not establish absolute time limits on the 
provision of specific services or on the provision of services to an 
individual. The duration of each service needed by an individual must be 
determined on an individual basis and reflected in that individual's 
IWRP.
    (d) Authorization of services. The State unit shall establish 
policies related to the timely authorization of services, including any 
conditions under which verbal authorization can be given.

Sec. 361.51  Written standards for facilities and providers of services.

    The State plan must assure that the designated State unit 
establishes, maintains, makes available to the public, and implements 
written minimum standards for the various types of facilities and 
providers of services used by the State unit in providing vocational 
rehabilitation services, in accordance with the following requirements:
    (a) Accessibility of facilities. Any facility in which vocational 
rehabilitation services are provided must be accessible to individuals 
receiving services and must comply with the requirements of the 
Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, the Uniform Accessibility Standards 
and their implementing regulations in 41 CFR part 101, subpart 101-19.6, 
the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, and section 504 of the Act.
    (b) Personnel standards. (1) Qualified personnel. Providers of 
vocational rehabilitation services shall use qualified personnel, in 
accordance with any applicable national or State-approved or -recognized 
certification, licensing, or registration requirements, or, in the 
absence of these requirements, other

[[Page 329]]

comparable requirements (including State personnel requirements), that 
apply to the profession or discipline in which that category of 
personnel is providing vocational rehabilitation services.
    (2) Affirmative action. Providers of vocational rehabilitation 
services shall take affirmative action to employ and advance in 
employment qualified individuals with disabilities.
    (3) Special communication needs personnel. Providers of vocational 
rehabilitation services shall--
    (i) Include among their personnel, or obtain the services of, 
individuals able to communicate in the native languages of applicants 
and eligible individuals who have limited English speaking ability; and
    (ii) Ensure that appropriate modes of communication for all

opportunity to make informed choices throughout the vocational 
rehabilitation process in accordance with the following requirements:
    (a) Each State unit, in consultation with its State Rehabilitation 
Advisory Council, if it has one, shall develop and implement written 
policies and procedures that enable each individual to make an informed 
choice with regard to the selection of a long-term vocational goal, 
intermediate rehabilitation objectives, vocational rehabilitation 
services, including assessment services, and service providers. These 
policies and procedures must ensure that each individual receives, 
through appropriate modes of communication, information concerning the 
availability and scope of informed choice, the manner in which informed 
choice may be exercised, and the availability of support services for 
individuals with cognitive or other disabilities who require assistance 
in exercising informed choice.
    (b) In developing an individual's IWRP, the State unit shall provide 
the individual, or assist the individual in acquiring, information 
necessary to make an informed choice about the specific services, 
including the providers of those services, that are needed to achieve 
the individual's vocational goal. This information must include, at a 
minimum, information relating to the cost, accessibility, and duration 
of potential services, the consumer satisfaction with those services to 
the extent that information relating to consumer satisfaction is 
available, the qualifications of potential service providers, the types 
of services offered by those providers, and the degree to which services 
are provided in integrated settings.
    (c) In providing, or assisting the individual in acquiring, the 
information required under paragraph (b) of this section, the State unit 
may use, but is not limited to, the following methods or sources of 
information:
    (1) State or regional lists of services and service providers.
    (2) Periodic consumer satisfaction surveys and reports.

<R05>
Sec. 361.53  Availability of comparable services and benefits.

    (a) The State plan must assure that--

[[Page 330]]

    (1) Prior to providing any vocational rehabilitation services to an 
eligible individual, or to members of the individual's family, except 
those services listed in paragraph (b) of this section, the State unit 
shall determine whether comparable services and benefits exist under any 
other program and whether those services and benefits are available to 
the individual;
    (2) If comparable services or benefits exist under any other program 
and are available to the eligible individual at the time needed to 
achieve the rehabilitation objectives in the individual's IWRP, the 
State unit shall use those comparable services or benefits to meet, in 
whole or in part, the cost of vocational rehabilitation services; and
    (3) If comparable services or benefits exist under any other 
program, but are not available to the individual at the time needed to 
satisfy the rehabilitation objectives in the individual's IWRP, the 
State unit shall provide vocational rehabilitation services until those 
comparable services and benefits become available.

benefits under any other program would delay the provision of vocational 
rehabilitation services to any individual who is determined to be at 
extreme medical risk, based on medical evidence provided by an 
appropriate qualified medical professional; or
    (2) An immediate job placement would be lost due to a delay in the 
provision of comparable services and benefits.

Sec. 361.57  Review of rehabilitation counselor or coordinator determinations.

    The State plan must contain procedures, including standards of 
review under paragraph (b)(7) of this section, established by the 
director of the designated State unit to ensure that any applicant or 
eligible individual who is dissatisfied with any determinations made by 
a rehabilitation counselor or coordinator concerning the furnishing or 
denial of services may request, or, if appropriate, may request through 
the individual's representative, a timely review of those 
determinations. The procedures established by the director of the State 
unit must be in accordance with the following provisions:

[[Page 332]]

    (a) Informal resolution. The State unit may establish an informal 
process to resolve a request for review without conducting a formal 
hearing. However, a State's informal process must be conducted and 
concluded within the time period established under paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section for holding a formal hearing. If informal resolution is not 
successful, a formal hearing must be conducted by the end of this same 
period, unless the parties agree to a specific extension of time.
    (b) Formal hearing procedures. Except as provided in paragraph (d) 
of this section, the State unit shall establish formal review procedures 
that provide that--
    (1) A hearing by an impartial hearing officer, selected in 
accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, must be held within 45 
days of an individual's request for review, unless informal resolution 
is achieved prior to the 45th day or the parties agree to a specific 
extension of time;
    (2) The State unit may not institute a suspension, reduction, or 
termination of services being provided under an IWRP pending a final 
determination of the formal hearing under this paragraph or informal 
resolution under paragraph (a) of this section, unless the individual 
or, in an appropriate case, the individual's representative so requests 
or the agency has evidence that the services have been obtained through 
misrepresentation, fraud, collusion, or criminal conduct on the part of 
the individual;
    (3) The individual or, if appropriate, the individual's 
representative must be afforded an opportunity to present additional 
evidence, information, and witnesses to the impartial hearing officer, 
to be represented by counsel or other appropriate advocate, and to 
examine all witnesses and other relevant sources of information and 
evidence;
    (4) The impartial hearing officer shall make a decision based on the 
provisions of the approved State plan, the Act, Federal vocational 
rehabilitation regulations, and State regulations and policies that are 
consistent with Federal requirements and shall provide to the individual 
or, if appropriate, the individual's representative and to the director 
of the designated State unit a full written report of the findings and 
grounds for the decision within 30 days of the completion of the 
hearing;
    (5) If the director of the designated State unit decides to review 
the decision of the impartial hearing officer, the director shall notify 
in writing the individual or, if appropriate, the individual's 
representative of that intent within 20 days of the mailing of the 
impartial hearing officer's decision;
    (6) If the director of the designated State unit fails to provide 
the notice required by paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the impartial 
hearing officer's decision becomes a final decision;
    (7) The decision of the director of the designated State unit to 
review any impartial hearing officer's decision must be based on 
standards of review contained in written State unit policy;
    (8) If the director of the designated State unit decides to review 
the decision of the impartial hearing officer, the director shall 
provide the individual or, if appropriate, the individual's 
representative an opportunity to submit additional evidence and 
information relevant to the final decision;
    (9) The director may not overturn or modify a decision, or part of a 
decision, of an impartial hearing officer that supports the position of 
the individual unless the director concludes, based on clear and 
convincing evidence, that the decision of the impartial hearing officer 
is clearly erroneous because it is contrary to the approved State plan, 
the Act, Federal vocational rehabilitation regulations, or State 
regulations or policies that are consistent with Federal requirements;
    (10) Within 30 days of providing notice of intent to review the 
impartial hearing officer's decision, the director of the designated 
State unit shall make a final decision and provide a full report in 
writing of the decision, including the findings and the statutory, 
regulatory, or policy grounds for the decision, to the individual or, if 
appropriate, the individual's representative;
    (11) The director of the designated State unit may not delegate 
responsibility to make any final decision to any other officer or

reasonable time extensions for good cause shown at the request of a 
party or at the request of both parties.
    (c) Selection of impartial hearing officers. Except as provided in 
paragraph (d) of this section, the impartial hearing officer for a 
particular case must be selected--
    (1) From among the pool of persons qualified to be an impartial 
hearing officer, as defined in Sec. 361.5(b)(22), who are identified by

determinations and to carry out the responsibilities of the director of 
the designated State unit under this section.
    (e) Informing affected individuals. The State unit shall inform, 
through appropriate modes of communication, all applicants and eligible 
individuals of--
    (1) Their right to review under this section, including the names 
and addresses of individuals with whom appeals may be filed; and
    (2) The manner in which an impartial hearing officer will be

    Subpart C--Financing of State Vocational Rehabilitation Programs


<R05>
Sec. 361.60  Matching requirements.

    (a) Federal share--(1) General. Except as provided in paragraphs 
(a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section, the Federal share for expenditures 
made by the State unit under the State plan, including expenditures for 
the provision of vocational rehabilitation services, administration of 
the State plan, and the development and implementation of the strategic 
plan, is 78.7 percent.
    (2) Construction projects. The Federal share for expenditures made 
for the construction of a facility for community rehabilitation program 
purposes may not be more than 50 percent of the total cost of the 
project.
    (3) Innovation and expansion grant activities. The Federal share for 
the cost of innovation and expansion grant activities funded by 
appropriations under part C of title I of the Act is 90 percent.
    (b) Non-Federal share--(1) General. Except as provided in paragraphs 
(b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section, expenditures made under the State 
plan to meet the non-Federal share under this section must be consistent 
with the provisions of 34 CFR 80.24.
    (2) Third party in-kind contributions. Third party in-kind 
contributions specified in 34 CFR 80.24(a)(2) may not be used to meet 
the non-Federal share under this section.
    (3) Contributions by private entities. Expenditures made from 
contributions by private organizations, agencies, or individuals that 
are deposited in the account of the State agency or sole local agency in 
accordance with State law and that are earmarked, under a condition 
imposed by the contributor,

[[Page 334]]

may be used as part of the non-Federal share under this section if the 
following requirements are met:
    (i) The funds are earmarked for meeting in whole or in part the 
State's share for establishing a community rehabilitation program or 
constructing a particular facility for community rehabilitation program 
purposes.
    (ii) If the funds are earmarked for any other purpose under the 
State plan, the expenditures do not benefit in any way the donor, an 
individual to whom the donor is related by blood or marriage or with 
whom the donor has a close personal relationship, or an individual, 
entity, or organization with whom the donor shares a financial interest. 
The Secretary does not consider a donor's receipt from the State unit of 
a grant, subgrant, or contract with funds allotted under this part to be 
a benefit for the purposes of this paragraph if the grant, subgrant, or 
contract is awarded under the State's regular competitive procedures.

(Authority: Secs. 7(7), 101(a)(3), and 104 of the Act; 29 U.S.C. 706(7), 
721(a)(3) and 724)


    Note: The Secretary notes that contributions may be earmarked in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section for providing 
particular services (e.g., rehabilitation technology services); serving 
individuals with certain types of disabilities (e.g., individuals who 
are blind), consistent with the State's order of selection, if 
applicable; providing services to special groups that State or Federal 
law permits to be targeted for services (e.g., students with 
disabilities who are receiving special education services), consistent 
with the State's order of selection, if applicable; or carrying out 
particular types of administrative activities permissible under State 
law. Contributions also may be restricted to particular geographic areas 
to increase services or expand the scope of services that are available 
statewide under the State plan. However, if a contribution is earmarked 
for a restricted geographic area, expenditures from that contribution 
may be used to meet the non-Federal share requirement only if the State 
unit requests and the Secretary approves a waiver of statewideness, in 
accordance with Sec. 361.26.


<R05>
Sec. 361.61  Limitation on use of funds for construction expenditures.

    No more than 10 percent of a State's allotment for any fiscal year 
under section 110 of the Act may be spent on the construction of 
facilities for community rehabilitation program purposes.

(Authority: Sec. 101(a)(17)(A) of the Act; 29 U.S.C. 721(a)(17)(A))


<R05>
Sec. 361.62  Maintenance of effort requirements.

    (a) General requirements. (1) The Secretary reduces the amount 
otherwise payable to a State for a fiscal year by the amount by which 
the total expenditures from non-Federal sources under the State plan for 
the previous fiscal year were less than the total of those expenditures 
for the fiscal year two years prior to the previous fiscal year. For 
example, for fiscal year 1996, a State's maintenance of effort level is 
based on the amount of its expenditures from non-Federal sources for 
fiscal year 1994. Thus, if the State's non-Federal expenditures in 1996 
are less than they were in 1994, the State has a maintenance of effort 
deficit, and the Secretary reduces the State's allotment in 1997 by the 
amount of that deficit.
    (2) If, at the time the Secretary makes a determination that a State 
has failed to meet its maintenance of effort requirements, it is too 
late for the Secretary to make a reduction in accordance with paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section, then the Secretary recovers the amount of the 
maintenance of effort deficit through audit disallowance.
    (b) Specific requirements for construction of facilities. If the 
State plan provides for the construction of a facility for community 
rehabilitation program purposes, the amount of the State's share of 
expenditures for vocational rehabilitation services under the plan, 
other than for the construction of a facility for community 
rehabilitation program purposes or the establishment of a facility for 
community rehabilitation purposes, must be at least equal to the 
expenditures for those services for the second prior fiscal year. If a 
State fails to meet the requirements of this paragraph, the Secretary 
recovers the amount of the maintenance of effort deficit through audit 
disallowance.
    (c) Separate State agency for vocational rehabilitation services for 
individuals who are blind. If there is a separate part of

[[Page 335]]

the State plan administered by a separate State agency to provide 
vocational rehabilitation services for individuals who are blind--
    (1) Satisfaction of the maintenance of effort requirements under 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section are determined based on the total 
amount of a State's non-Federal expenditures under both parts of the 
State plan; and
    (2) If a State fails to meet any maintenance of effort requirement, 
the Secretary reduces the amount otherwise payable to the State for that 
fiscal year under each part of the plan in direct relation to the amount 
by which expenditures from non-Federal sources under each part of the 
plan in the previous fiscal year were less than they were for that part 
of the plan for the fiscal year two years prior to the previous fiscal 
year.
    (d) Waiver or modification. (1) The Secretary may waive or modify 
the maintenance of effort requirement in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section if the Secretary determines that a waiver or modification is 
necessary to permit the State to respond to exceptional or 
uncontrollable circumstances, such as a major natural disaster or a 
serious economic downturn, that--
    (i) Cause significant unanticipated expenditures or reductions in 
revenue; and
    (ii) Result in--
    (A) A general reduction of programs within the State; or
    (B) The State making substantial expenditures in the vocational 
rehabilitation program for long-term purposes due to the one-time costs 
associated with the construction of a facility for community 
rehabilitation program purposes, the establishment of a facility for 
community rehabilitation program purposes, or the acquisition of 
equipment.
    (2) The Secretary may waive or modify the maintenance of effort 
requirement in paragraph (b) of this section or the 10 percent allotment 
limitation in Sec. 361.61 if the Secretary determines that a waiver or 
modification is necessary to permit the State to respond to exceptional 
or uncontrollable circumstances, such as a major natural disaster, that 
result in significant destruction of existing facilities and require the 
State to make substantial expenditures for the construction of a 
facility for community rehabilitation program purposes or the 
establishment of a facility for community rehabilitation program 
purposes in order to provide vocational rehabilitation services.
    (3) A written request for waiver or modification, including 
supporting justification, must be submitted to the Secretary as soon as 
the State determines that an exceptional or uncontrollable circumstance 
will prevent it from making its required expenditures from non-Federal 
sources.

Sec. 361.63  Program income.

    (a) Definition--Program income means gross income received by the 
State that is directly generated by an activity supported under this 
part.
    (b) Sources. Sources of program income include, but are not limited 
to, payments from the Social Security Administration for rehabilitating 
Social Security beneficiaries, payments received from workers' 
compensation funds, fees for services to defray part or all of the costs 
of services provided to particular individuals, and income generated by 
a State-operated community rehabilitation program.
    (c) Use of program income. (1) Except as provided in paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section, program income, whenever earned, must be used 
for the provision of vocational rehabilitation services, the 
administration of the State plan, and developing and implementing the 
strategic plan. Program income is considered earned when it is received.
    (2) Payments provided to a State from the Social Security 
Administration for rehabilitating Social Security beneficiaries may also 
be used to carry out programs under part B of title I of the Act (client 
assistance), part C of title I of the Act (innovation and expansion), 
part C of title VI of the Act (supported employment) and title VII of 
the Act (independent living).
    (3) The State is authorized to treat program income as--
    (i) An addition to the grant funds to be used for additional 
allowable program expenditures, in accordance with 34 CFR 80.25(g)(2); 
or

[[Page 336]]

    (ii) A deduction from total allowable costs, in accordance with 34 
CFR 80.25(g)(1).
    (4) Program income may not be used to meet the non-Federal share 
requirement under Sec. 361.60.

<R05>
Sec. 361.64  Obligation of Federal funds and program income.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, any Federal 
funds, including reallotted funds, that are appropriated for a fiscal 
year to carry out a program under this part that are not obligated by 
the State unit by the beginning of the succeeding fiscal year and any 
program income received during a fiscal year that is not obligated by 
the State unit by the beginning of the succeeding fiscal year must 
remain available for obligation by the State unit during that succeeding 
fiscal year.
    (b) Federal funds appropriated for a fiscal year remain available 
for obligation in the succeeding fiscal year only to the extent that the 
State unit met the matching requirement for those Federal funds by 
obligating, in accordance with 34 CFR 76.707, the non-Federal share in 
the fiscal year for which the funds were appropriated.

(Authority: Sec. 19 of the Act; 29 U.S.C. 718)


<R05>
Sec. 361.65  Allotment and payment of Federal funds for vocational rehabilitation services.

    (a) Allotment. (1) The allotment of Federal funds for vocational 
rehabilitation services for each State is computed in accordance with 
the requirements of section 110 of the Act, and payments are made to the 
State on a quarterly basis, unless some other period is established by 
the Secretary.
    (2) If the State plan designates one State agency to administer, or 
supervise the administration of, the part of the plan under which 
vocational rehabilitation services are provided for individuals who are 
blind and another State agency to administer the rest of the plan, the 
division of the State's allotment is a matter for State determination.
    (b) Reallotment. (1) The Secretary determines not later than 45 days 
before the end of a fiscal year which States, if any, will not use their 
full allotment.
    (2) As soon as possible, but not later than the end of the fiscal 
year, the Secretary reallots these funds to other States that can use 
those additional funds during the current or subsequent fiscal year, 
provided the State can meet the matching requirement by obligating the 
non-Federal share of any reallotted funds in the fiscal year for which 
the funds were appropriated.
    (3) Funds reallotted to another State are considered to be an 
increase in the recipient State's allotment for the fiscal year for 
which the funds were appropriated.

for the same or similar work performed by individuals who are not 
disabled.
    (ii) Integrated setting means a setting typically found in the 
community in which an individual with the most severe disabilities

extended services; and
    (B) As discrete post-employment services following transition in 
accordance with Sec. 363.4(c)(3);
    (iv) Extended services means on-going support services and other

providers to charge consumers for the cost of IL services or if a State

   Determining Whether State Funding Equals or Exceeds Federal Funding


<R05>
Sec. 366.29  When may the Director of the designated State unit (DSU) award grants to centers?

    (a) The Director of the DSU (Director) may award grants under 
section 723 of the Act and this subpart to centers located within the 
State or in a bordering State in a fiscal year if--
    (1) The Director submits to the Secretary and obtains approval of an 
application to award grants for that fiscal year under section 723 of 
the Act and Sec. 366.32 (a) and (b); and
    (2) The Secretary determines that the amount of State funds that 
were earmarked by the State to support the general operation of centers 
meeting the requirements of part C of chapter 1 of title VII of the Act 
in the second fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the 
application is submitted equaled or exceeded the amount of funds 
allotted to the State under section 721 (c) and (d) of the Act (or part 
B of title VII of the Act as in effect on October 28, 1992) for that 
preceding fiscal year.
    (b) For purposes of section 723(a)(1)(A)(iii) of the Act and this 
subpart, the second fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the 
State submits an application to administer the CIL program is considered 
the ``preceding fiscal year.'' Example: If FY 1995 is the fiscal year 
for which the State submits an application to administer the CIL program 
under this subpart, FY 1993 is the ``preceding fiscal year.'' In 
determining the ``preceding fiscal

[[Page 377]]

year'' under this subpart, the Secretary makes any adjustments necessary 
to accommodate a State's multi-year funding cycle or fiscal year that 
does not coincide with the Federal fiscal year.

Sec. 366.30  What are earmarked funds?

    (a) For purposes of this subpart, the amount of State funds that 
were earmarked by a State to support the general operation of centers 
does not include--
    (1) Federal funds used for the general operation of centers;
    (2) State funds used to purchase specific services from a center, 
including State funds used for grants or contracts to procure or 
purchase personal assistance services or particular types of skills 
training;
    (3) State attendant care funds; or
    (4) Social Security Administration reimbursement funds.
    (b) For purposes of this subpart, earmarked funds means funds 
appropriated by the State and expressly or clearly identified as State 
expenditures in the relevant fiscal year for the sole purpose of funding 
the general operation of centers.

<R05>
Sec. 366.31  What happens if the amount of earmarked funds does not equal or exceed the amount of Federal funds for a preceding fiscal year?

    If the State submits an application to administer the CIL program 
under section 723 of the Act and this subpart for a fiscal year, but did 
not earmark the amount of State funds required by Sec. 366.29(a)(2) in 
the preceding fiscal year, the State shall be ineligible to make grants 
under section 723 of the Act and this subpart after the end of the 
fiscal year succeeding the preceding fiscal year and for each succeeding 
fiscal year.
    Example: A State meets the earmarking requirement in FY 1994. It 
also meets this requirement in FY 1995. However, in reviewing the 
State's application to administer the CIL program in FY 1998, the 
Secretary determines that the State failed to meet the earmarking 
requirement in FY 1996. The State may continue to award grants in FY 
1997 but may not do so in FY 1998 and succeeding fiscal years.

<R05>
Sec. 366.32  Under what circumstances may the DSU make grants?

    (a) To be eligible to award grants under this subpart and to carry 
out section 723 of the Act for a fiscal year, the Director must submit 
to the Secretary for approval an application at the time and in the 
manner that the Secretary may require and that includes, at a minimum--
    (1) Information demonstrating that the amount of funds earmarked by 
the State for the general operation of centers meets the requirements in 
Sec. 366.29(a)(1); and
    (2) A summary of the annual performance reports submitted to the 
Director from centers in accordance with Sec. 366.50(n).
    (b) If the amount of funds earmarked by the State for the general 
operation of centers meets the requirements in Sec. 366.29(a)(1), the 
Secretary approves the application and designates the Director to award 
the grants and carry out section 723 of the Act.
    (c) If the Secretary designates the Director to award grants and 
carry out section 723 of the Act under paragraph (b) of this section, 
the Director makes grants to eligible agencies in a State, as described 
in Sec. 366.2, for a fiscal year from the amount of funds allotted to 
the State under section 721(c) and (d) of the Act.
    (d)(1) In the case of a State in which there is both a DSU 
responsible for providing IL services to the general population and a 
DSU responsible for providing IL services for individuals who are blind, 
for purposes of subparts D and E of this part, the ``Director'' shall be 
the Director of the general DSU.
    (2) The State units described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section 
shall periodically consult with each other with respect to the provision 
of services for individuals who are blind.
    (e) The Director may enter into assistance contracts with centers to 
carry out section 723 of the Act. For

[[Page 378]]

purposes of this paragraph, an assistance contract is an instrument 
whose principal purpose is to transfer funds allotted to the State under 
section 721 (c) and (d) of the Act and this part to an eligible agency 
to carry out section 723 of the Act. Under an assistance contract, the 
DSU shall assume a role consistent with that of the Secretary under 
section 722 of the Act. If the DSU uses an assistance contract to award 
funds under section 723 of the Act, the DSU may not add any 
requirements, terms, or conditions to the assistance contract other than 
those that would be permitted if the assistance contract were a grant 
rather than an assistance contract. Under an assistance contract, as 
defined in this paragraph, the role of the DSU is to ensure that the 
terms of the assistance contract, which are established by chapter 1 of 
title VII of the Act and the implementing regulations in this part and 
34 CFR part 364, are satisfied.
    (f) The Director may not enter into procurement contracts with 
centers to carry out section 723 of the Act. For purposes of this 
paragraph, a procurement contract is an instrument whose principal 
purpose is to acquire (by purchase, lease, or barter) property or 
services for the direct benefit or use of the DSU. Under a procurement 
contract, the DSU prescribes the specific services it intends to procure 
and the terms and conditions of the procurement.
    (g) In the enforcement of any breach of the terms and conditions of 
an assistance contract, the DSU shall follow the procedures established 
in Secs. 366.40 through 366.45.

Director shall follow the order of priorities in Sec. 366.22 for

Sec. 370.5  What regulations apply?

    The following regulations apply to the expenditure of funds under 
the CAP:
    (a) The Education Department General Administrative Regulations 
(EDGAR) as follows:
    (1) 34 CFR part 74 (Administration of Grants to Institutions of 
Higher Education, Hospitals and Nonprofit Organizations) applies to the 
designated agency if the designated agency is not a State agency, local 
government agency, or Indian tribal organization. As the entity that 
eventually, if not directly, receives the CAP grant funds, the 
designated agency is considered a recipient for purposes of part 74.
    (2) 34 CFR part 76 (State-Administered Programs) applies to the 
State and, if the designated agency is a State or local government 
agency, to the designated agency, except for--
    (i) Sec. 76.103;
    (ii) Secs. 76.125 through 76.137;
    (iii) Secs. 76.300 through 76.401;
    (iv) Sec. 76.708;
    (v) Sec. 76.734; and
    (vi) Sec. 76.740.

Education Programs and Activities).
    (5) 34 CFR part 80 (Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants 
and Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments) applies to 
the State and, if the designated agency is a State or local government 
agency, to the designated agency.
    (6) 34 CFR part 81 (General Education Provisions Act-Enforcement) 
applies to both the State and the designated agency, whether or not the 
designated agency is the actual recipient of the CAP grant. As the 
entity that eventually, if not directly, receives the CAP grant funds, 
the designated agency is considered a recipient for purposes of Part 81.
    (7) 34 CFR part 82 (New Restrictions on Lobbying).

    (c) The regulations in 34 CFR 369.43, 369.46 and 369.48, relating to 
various conditions to be met by grantees.

    Note: Any funds made available to a State under this program that 
are transferred by a State to a designated agency do not comprise a 
subgrant as that term is defined in 34 CFR 77.1. The designated agency 
is not, therefore, in these circumstances a subgrantee, as that term is 
defined in that section or in 34 CFR part 74, 76, or 80.)


(Authority: 29 U.S.C. 711(c) and 732)

part:
    Act means the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended.
    Advocacy means pleading an individual's cause or speaking or writing 
in support of an individual. Advocacy may be formal, as in the case of a 
lawyer representing an individual in a court of law or in formal 
administrative proceedings before government agencies (whether State, 
local or Federal). Advocacy also may be informal, as in the case of a 
lawyer or non-lawyer representing an individual in negotiations, 
mediation, or informal administrative proceedings before government 
agencies (whether State, local or Federal), or as in the case of a 
lawyer or non-lawyer representing an individual's cause before private 
entities or organizations, or government agencies (whether State, local 
or Federal). Advocacy may be on behalf of--
    (1) A single individual, in which case it is individual advocacy;
    (2) More than one individual or a group or class of individuals, in 
which case it is systems (or systemic) advocacy; or
    (3) Oneself, in which case it is self advocacy.
    Class action means a formal legal suit on behalf of a group or class 
of individuals filed in a Federal or State court that meets the 
requirements for a ``class action'' under Federal or State law. 
``Systems (or systemic) advocacy'' that does not include filing a formal 
class action in a Federal or State court is not considered a class 
action for purposes of this part.
    Client or client applicant means an individual receiving or seeking 
services under the Act, respectively.
    Designated agency means the agency designated by the Governor under 
Sec. 370.2 to conduct a client assistance program under this part.
    Mediation means the act or process of using an independent third 
party to act as a mediator, intermediary, or conciliator to settle 
differences or disputes between persons or parties. The third party who 
acts as a mediator, intermediary, or conciliator may not be any entity 
or individual who is connected in any way with the eligible system or 
the agency, entity, or individual with whom the individual with a 
disability has a dispute. Mediation may involve the use of professional 
mediators or any other independent third party mutually agreed to by the 
parties to the dispute.
    Services under the Act means vocational rehabilitation, independent 
living, supported employment, and other similar rehabilitation services 
provided under the Act. For purposes of the CAP, the term ``services 
under the Act'' does not include activities carried out under the 
protection and advocacy program authorized by section 509 of the Act 
(i.e., the Protection and Advocacy of Individual Rights (PAIR) program, 
34 CFR part 381).
    State means, in addition to each of the several States of the United 
States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, The 
United States Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of 
the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Republic of Palau (but only until 
September 30, 1998), except for purposes of the allotments under section 
112 of the

[[Page 405]]

Act, in which case ``State'' does not mean or include Guam, American 
Samoa, the United States Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the 
Northern Mariana Islands, and the Republic of Palau.

(Authority: 29 U.S.C. 711(c) and 732; Pub. L. 101-219 (Dec. 12, 1989); 
Pub. L. 99-658 (Nov. 14, 1986); and Pub. L. 99-239 (Jan. 14, 1986))

    The designated agency shall provide, as appropriate, the CAP 
services described in Sec. 370.4 in formats that are accessible to 
clients or client applicants who seek or receive CAP services.

          Subpart B--What Requirements Apply to Redesignation?


<R05>
Sec. 370.10  When do the requirements for redesignation apply?

    (a) The Governor may not redesignate the agency designated pursuant 
to section 112(c) of the Act and Sec. 370.2(b) without good cause and 
without complying with the requirements of Secs. 370.10 through 370.17.
    (b) For purposes of Secs. 370.10 through 370.17, a ``redesignation 
of'' or ``to redesignate'' a designated agency means any change in or 
transfer of the designation of an agency previously designated by the 
Governor to conduct the State's CAP to a new or different agency, unit, 
or organization, including--
    (1) A decision by a designated agency to cancel its existing 
contract with another entity with which it has previously contracted to 
carry out and operate all or part of its responsibilities under the CAP 
(including providing advisory, assistance, or advocacy services to 
eligible clients and client applicants); or
    (2) A decision by a designated agency not to renew its existing 
contract with another entity with which it has previously contracted. 
Therefore, an agency that is carrying out a State's CAP under a contract 
with a designated agency is considered a designated agency for purposes 
of Secs. 370.10 through 370.17.
    (c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, a designated 
agency that does not renew a contract for CAP services because it is 
following State procurement laws that require contracts to be awarded 
through a competitive bidding process is presumed to have good cause for 
not renewing an existing contract. However, this presumption may be 
rebutted.
    (d) If State procurement laws require a designated agency to award a 
contract through a competitive bidding process, the designated agency 
must hold public hearings on the request for proposal before awarding 
the new contract.

decision to redesignate; and

[[Page 406]]

    (2) Advise the designated agency that it has at least 30 days from 
receipt of the notice of proposed redesignation to respond to the 
Governor and that the response must be in writing.
    (c) The notice of proposed redesignation must be published in a 
place and manner that provides the SRAC, the SILC, individuals with 
disabilities or their representatives, and the public with at least 30 
days to submit oral or written comments to the Governor.
    (d) Following public notice, public hearings concerning the proposed 
redesignation must be conducted in an accessible format that provides 
individuals with disabilities or their representatives an opportunity 
for comment. The Governor shall maintain a written public record of 
these hearings.
    (e) The Governor shall fully consider any public comments before 
issuing a written decision to redesignate.

[[Page 408]]

application that includes, at a minimum--
    (1) The name of the designated agency; and
    (2) An assurance that the designated agency meets the independence 
requirement of section 112(c)(1)(A) of the Act and Sec. 370.2(c), or 
that the State is exempted from that requirement under section 
112(c)(1)(A) of the Act and Sec. 370.2(d).
    (b)(1) Each State also shall submit to the Secretary an assurance 
that the designated agency has the authority to pursue legal, 
administrative, and other appropriate remedies to ensure the protection 
of the rights of clients or client applicants within the State.
    (2) The authority to pursue remedies described in paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section must include the authority to pursue those remedies 
against the State vocational rehabilitation agency and other appropriate 
State agencies. The designated agency meets this requirement if it has 
the authority to pursue those remedies either on its own behalf or by 
obtaining necessary services, such as legal representation, from outside 
sources.
    (c) Each State also shall submit to the Secretary assurances that--
    (1) All entities conducting, administering, operating, or carrying

individuals with disabilities in the State will advise all clients and 
client applicants of the existence of the CAP, the services provided 
under the program, and how to contact the designated agency;
    (2) The designated agency will meet each of the requirements in this 
part; and

  Subpart D--How Does the Secretary Allocate and Reallocate Funds to a 
                                 State?


<R05>
Sec. 370.30  How does the Secretary allocate funds?

    (a) The Secretary allocates the funds available under this part for 
any fiscal year to the States on the basis of the relative population of 
each State. The Secretary allocates at least $50,000 to each State, 
unless the provisions of section 112(e)(1)(D) of the Act (which provides 
for increasing the minimum allotment if the appropriation for the CAP 
exceeds $7,500,000 or the appropriation is increased by a certain 
percentage described in section 112(e)(1)(D)(ii) of the Act) are 
applicable.
    (b) The Secretary allocates $30,000 each, unless the provisions of 
section 112(e)(1)(D) of the Act are applicable, to American Samoa, Guam, 
the Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Republic of 
Palau, except that the Secretary allocates to the Republic of Palau only 
75 percent of this allotment in fiscal year 1996, only 50 percent of 
this allotment in fiscal year 1997, only 25 percent of this allotment in 
fiscal year 1998, and none of this allotment in fiscal year 1999 and 
thereafter.
    (c) Unless prohibited or otherwise provided by State law, 
regulation, or policy, the Secretary pays to the designated agency, from 
the State allotment under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the 
amount specified in the State's approved request. Because the designated 
agency is the eventual, if not the direct, recipient of the CAP funds, 
34 CFR parts 74 and 81 apply to the designated agency, whether or not 
the designated agency is the actual recipient of the CAP grant. However, 
because it is the State that submits an application for and receives the 
CAP grant, the State remains the grantee for purposes of 34 CFR parts 76 
and 80.

[[Page 409]]

In addition, both the State and the designated agency are considered 
recipients for purposes of 34 CFR part 81.

<R05>
Sec. 370.31  How does the Secretary reallocate funds?

    (a) The Secretary reallocates funds in accordance with section 
112(e)(2) of the Act.

before the end of the fiscal year for which CAP funds were received 
whether the designated agency is making available for reallotment any of 
those CAP funds that it will be unable to obligate in that fiscal year.

the designated agency shall apply the cost principles in accordance with 
34 CFR 80.22(b).
    (b) If the designated agency is a private nonprofit organization, 
the designated agency shall apply the cost principles in accordance with 
subpart Q of 34 CFR part 74.
    (c) In addition to those allowable costs established in EDGAR, and 
consistent with the program activities listed in Sec. 370.4, the cost of 
travel in connection with the provision to a client or client applicant 
of assistance under this program is allowable. The cost of travel 
includes the cost of travel for an attendant if the attendant must 
accompany the client or client applicant.
    (d) The State and the designated agency are accountable, both 
jointly and severally, to the Secretary for the proper use of funds made 
available under this part. However, the Secretary may choose to recover 
funds under the procedures in 34 CFR part 81 from either the State or 
the designated agency, or both, depending on the circumstances of each 
case.

may take into account its level of resources.
    (b) For purposes of this section, mediation may involve the use of 
professional mediators, other independent third parties mutually agreed

photographs, and records of evaluation, must be held strictly 
confidential.
    (b) The designated agency's use of information and records

to the Secretary, if the Secretary so requests, the identity of, or any 
other personally identifiable information (i.e., name, address, 
telephone number, social security number, or any other official code or 
number by which an individual may be readily identified) related to, any 
individual requesting assistance under the CAP if--
    (1) An audit, evaluation, monitoring review, State plan assurance 
review, or other investigation produces reliable evidence that there is 
probable cause to believe that the designated agency has violated its 
legislative mandate or misused Federal funds; or
    (2) The Secretary determines that this information may reasonably 
lead to further evidence that is directly related to alleged misconduct 
of the designated agency.
    (f) In addition to the protection afforded by paragraph (d) of this 
section, the right of a person or designated agency not to produce 
documents or disclose information to the Secretary is governed by the 
common law of privileges, as interpreted by the courts of the United

Sec. 379.3  Who is eligible for services under this program?

    (a) An individual is eligible for services under this program if the 
appropriate State vocational rehabilitation unit determines the 
individual to be an individual with a disability or an individual with a 
severe disability, as defined in sections 7(8)(A) and 7(15)(A), 
respectively, of the Act.
    (b) In making the determination under paragraph (a) of this section, 
the State vocational rehabilitation unit shall rely on the determination 
made by the recipient of the grant under which the services are 
provided, to the extent that the determination is appropriate, 
available, and consistent with the requirements of the Act.
    (c) If a State vocational rehabilitation unit does not notify a 
recipient of a grant within 60 days that the determination of the 
recipient is inappropriate, the recipient of the grant may consider the 
individual to be eligible for services.

(Authority: Sec. 621(a)(3) of the Act; 29 U.S.C. 795g(a)(3))

                         Appendix to Sec. 379.3

    The following guidance is provided regarding the determination of 
eligibility for PWI project services:
    (1) If an individual is referred to the PWI project by the State 
vocational rehabilitation (VR) unit and the individual has been 
determined by the State VR unit to be an ``individual with a 
disability'' under section 102(a)(1)(A) of the Act, then the PWI grantee 
may initiate services to that individual. In these instances, the State 
VR unit should provide documentation of this determination to the PWI 
grantee. If the State VR unit has determined that the individual also 
meets the definition of an ``individual with a severe disability'' under 
section 7(15)(A) of the Act, the PWI grantee should be advised of that 
determination and provided appropriate documentation of that 
determination.
    (2) If an individual is not referred to the PWI project by the State 
VR unit, then the PWI grantee makes an initial or preliminary 
determination that the individual is eligible for services because the 
individual meets the definition of an ``individual with a disability'' 
or an ``individual with a severe disability.'' The State VR unit has a 
maximum of 60 days to assess the appropriateness of the preliminary 
determination. If the State VR unit does not decide that the preliminary 
eligibility determination is inappropriate within this time period, the 
eligibility determination becomes final.

<R05>
Sec. 379.10  What types of project activities are required of each grantee under this program?

    Each grantee under the PWI program shall--
    (a) Arrange for the provision of, or provide individuals with 
disabilities with, job training in a realistic work setting, if 
appropriate to the needs of the individual, in order to prepare 
individuals for employment and career advancement in the competitive 
labor market;
    (b) Provide individuals with disabilities with job placement and 
career advancement services;
    (c) Provide individuals with disabilities with supportive services 
that are necessary to permit them to maintain the employment and career 
advancement for which they have received training under this program;
    (d) To the extent appropriate, provide for--
    (1) The development and modification of jobs and careers to 
accommodate the special needs of the individuals with disabilities being 
trained and employed under this program;
    (2) The purchase and distribution of rehabilitation technology to 
meet the needs of individuals with disabilities at job sites; and
    (3) The modification of any facilities or equipment of the employer 
that are to be used by individuals with disabilities under this program; 
and
    (e) Provide for the establishment of a Business Advisory Council 
(BAC) comprised of representatives of private industry, business 
concerns, organized labor, and individuals with disabilities and their 
representatives who will identify job and career availability within the 
community, the skills necessary to perform those jobs and careers, and 
prescribe appropriate training programs.

                         Appendix to Sec. 379.10

    A PWI grantee can meet the requirements of Sec. 379.10(a) (1) by 
directly providing job training to project participants, (2) by 
arranging for the provision of this training by other entities and 
taking appropriate follow-up measures to ensure that the training is, in 
fact, provided, or (3) by a combination of both (1) and (2). The job 
training provided must meet the definition of job training in

[[Page 427]]

Sec. 379.5(b)(5) and must be provided as appropriate to the needs of 
each individual served by the project. Although each individual served 
by the project may not need job training, the Secretary expects that 
each PWI project will have an identifiable job training component that 
is available to those individuals who need it. In order to meet the 
requirements of Sec. 379.10(a), the job training must be provided while 
the individual is participating in the project (i.e. prior to, or within 
90 days of, attaining competitive employment). Therefore, training 
provided by an employer more than 90 days after the individual begins 
competitive employment would not meet this requirement. In addition, a 
project that provides only job readiness training, as defined in 
Sec. 379.5(b)(4), would not meet the requirements of Sec. 379.10(a).

recipients under this program, authority for recipients to provide the 
following types of technical assistance:
    (a) Assisting employers in hiring individuals with disabilities.
    (b) Improving or developing relationships between grant recipients 
or prospective grant recipients and employers or organized labor.
    (c) Assisting employers in understanding and meeting the 
requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C 
12101 et seq.) as that Act relates to employment of individuals with 
disabilities.

Sec. 379.30  What selection criteria does the Secretary use under this program?

    The Secretary uses the following criteria to evaluate an 
application:
    (a) Extent of need for project (20 points). The Secretary reviews 
each application to determine the extent to which the project meets 
demonstrated needs. The Secretary looks for evidence that--
    (1) The applicant has described an existing current labor market 
analysis or other needs assessment, or one that it has performed in 
collaboration with private industry, that shows, for the geographic area 
to be served, a demand in the competitive labor market for the types of 
jobs for which project participants will be trained; and
    (2) The job training to be provided meets the identified needs for 
personnel in specific occupations or occupational categories in the 
geographic area to be served.

information that demonstrates--
    (1) The extent of the project's proposed collaboration with private 
industry in the planning, implementation, and evaluation of job 
training, placement, and career advancement activities; and
    (2) The extent of proposed participation of the BAC in the 
identification of job and career opportunities, the skills necessary to 
perform the jobs and careers identified, and the development of training 
programs designed to develop these skills.
    (c) Project design and plan of operation for achieving competitive 
employment outcomes (25 points). The Secretary reviews each application 
to determine--
    (1) The extent to which the project goals and objectives for 
achieving competitive employment outcomes for individuals with 
disabilities to be served by the project are clearly stated and meet the 
needs identified by the applicant and the purposes of the program;

[[Page 429]]

and a maximum use of comparable benefits and services;
    (5) The extent to which the applicant's management plan will ensure 
proper and efficient administration of the project; and
    (6) Whether the applicant has proposed a realistic timeline for the 
implementation of project activities to ensure timely accomplishment of 
proposed goals and objectives to achieve competitive employment outcomes 
for individuals with disabilities to be served by the project.
    (d) Adequacy of resources and quality of key personnel (10 points). 
The Secretary reviews each application to determine--
    (1) The adequacy of the resources (including facilities, equipment, 
and supplies) that the applicant plans to devote to the project;
    (2) The quality of key personnel who will be involved in the 
project, including--
    (i) The qualifications of the project director;
    (ii) The qualifications of each of the other key personnel to be 
used in the project; and
    (iii) The experience and training of key personnel in fields related 
to the objectives and activities of the project; and
    (3) The way the applicant plans to use its resources and personnel 
to achieve the project's goals and objectives, including the time that 
key personnel will commit to the project.
    (e) Budget and cost effectiveness (10 points). The Secretary reviews 
each application to determine the extent to which--
    (1) The budget is adequate to support the project; and
    (2) Costs are reasonable in relation to the objectives of the 
project.
    (f) Project evaluation (10 points). The Secretary reviews each 
application to determine the quality of the proposed evaluation plan 
with respect to--
    (1) Evaluating project operations and outcomes;
    (2) Involving the BAC in evaluating the project's job training, 
placement, and career advancement activities;
    (3) Meeting the annual evaluation reporting requirements in 
Sec. 379.21(a)(5);
    (4) Determining compliance with the indicators; and
    (5) Addressing any deficiencies identified through project 
evaluation.

Sec. 379.52  How is grantee performance measured using the compliance indicators?

    (a) Each compliance indicator establishes a minimum performance 
level.
    (b) Each compliance indicator also establishes three performance 
ranges with points assigned to each range. The higher the performance 
range, the greater the number of points assigned to that range.
    (c) If a grantee does not achieve the minimum performance level for 
a compliance indicator, the grantee receives no points.
    (d) If a grantee achieves or exceeds the minimum performance level, 
the grantee receives the points assigned to the particular performance 
range that corresponds to its actual level of performance.
    (e) The maximum possible composite score that a grantee can receive 
is 150 points.
    (f) A grantee must receive a composite score of at least 70 points

or part-time basis in an integrated setting; and
    (B) For which an individual is compensated at or above the minimum 
wage, but not less than the customary or usual wage paid by the employer 
for the same or similar work performed by individuals who are not 
disabled.
    (ii) Integrated setting means a setting typically found in the 
community in which an individual with the most severe disabilities 
interacts with non-disabled individuals, other than non-disabled

comparable positions interact with other persons.
    (iii) Supported employment services means on-going support services 
provided by the grantee with funds under this part--
    (A) For a period not to exceed 18 months, unless under special 
circumstances a longer period to achieve job stabilization has been

established in the individual's program of services, before an 
individual with the most severe disabilities makes the transition to 
extended services; and
    (B) As discrete post-employment services following transition in 
accordance with 34 CFR 363.4(c)(3);
    (iv) Extended services means on-going support services and other

    (v) Transitional employment means a series of temporary job 
placements in competitive work in an integrated work setting with on-
going support services for individuals with the most severe disabilities

services must include, at a minimum, twice-monthly monitoring at the 
work site of each individual in supported employment to assess

site, that are needed to maintain employment stability. If off-site 
monitoring is determined to be appropriate, it must, at a minimum,

    (d) For determining when an eligible system makes an obligation for 
various kinds of property or services, 34 CFR 75.707 and 76.707, as 
appropriate, apply to this program. If the appropriation for the PAIR 
program is less than $5,500,000, Sec. 75.707 applies. If the 
appropriation for the PAIR program is equal to or greater than 
$5,500,000, Sec. 76.707 applies. An eligible system is considered a

years of training for which the scholarship is received.
    (3) Until the scholar has satisfied the employment obligation 
described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the scholar will inform 
the grantee of any change of name, address, or employment status and

the right, title to, and interest in a vending facility may be vested in 
the blind vendor, the State licensing agency shall enter into a written 
agreement with each vendor who is to have such ownership. Such agreement 
shall contain in full the terms and conditions governing such ownership 
in accordance with criteria in the State licensing agency's regulations, 
this part, and the terms and conditions of the permit. The criteria 
established to govern the determination that the title may be so vested 
shall contain reasonable provisions to enable a vendor to purchase 
vending facility equipment and to ensure that no individual will be 
denied the opportunity to become a vendor because of his inability to 
purchase the vending facility equipment or the initial stock;
    (b) The State licensing agency shall establish in writing and 
maintain policies determining whether the vendor-owner or the State 
licensing agency shall be required to maintain the vending facility in 
good repair and in an attractive condition and replace worn-out or 
obsolete equipment; and if the former, such policies shall provide that 
upon such vendor-owner's failure to do so, the State licensing agency 
may make the necessary maintenance, replacement, or repairs and make 
equitable arrangements for reimbursement;
    (c) Where the vendor owns such equipment and is required to maintain 
the vending facility in good repair and in an attractive condition and 
replace worn-out or obsolete equipment, or agrees to purchase additional 
new equipment, service charges for such purposes shall be equitably 
reduced and the method for determining such amount shall be established 
by the State licensing agency in writing;
    (d) Where the vendor owns such equipment, the State licensing agency 
shall retain a first option to repurchase such equipment, and in the 
event the vendor-owner dies, or for any other reason ceases to be a 
licensee, or transfers to another vending facility, ownership of such 
equipment shall become vested in the State licensing agency for transfer 
to a successor licensee subject to an obligation on its part to pay to 
such vendor-owner or his estate, the fair value therein; and
    (e) The vendor-owner, his personal representative or next of kin 
shall be entitled to an opportunity for a full evidentiary hearing with 
respect to the determination of the amount to be paid by the State 
licensing agency for a vendor's ownership in the equipment. When the 
vendor-owner is dissatisfied with any decision rendered as a result of 
such hearing, he may file a complaint with the Secretary under 
Sec. 395.13 to request the convening of an ad hoc arbitration panel.


<R05>
Sec. 395.7  The issuance and conditions of licenses.

    (a) The State licensing agency shall establish in writing and 
maintain objective criteria for licensing qualified applicants, 
including a provision for giving preference to blind persons who are in 
need of employment. Such criteria shall also include provisions to 
assure that licenses will be issued only to persons who are determined 
by the State licensing agency to be:
    (1) Blind;
    (2) Citizens of the United States; and
    (3) Certified by the State vocational rehabilitation agency as 
qualified to operate a vending facility.

[[Page 470]]

    (b) The State licensing agency shall provide for the issuance of 
licenses for an indefinite period but subject to suspension or 
termination if, after affording the vendor an opportunity for a full 
evidentiary hearing, the State licensing agency finds that the vending 
facility is not being operated in accordance with its rules and 
regulations, the terms and conditions of the permit, and the terms and 
conditions of the agreement with the vendor.
    (c) The State licensing agency shall further establish in writing 
and maintain policies which have been developed with the active 
participation of the State Committee of Blind Vendors and which govern 
the duties, supervision, transfer, promotion, and financial 
participation of the vendors. The State licensing agency shall also 
establish procedures to assure that such policies have been explained to 
each blind vendor.


<R05>
Sec. 395.8  Distribution and use of income from vending machines on Federal property.

    (a) Vending machine income from vending machines on Federal property 
which has been disbursed to the State licensing agency by a property 
managing department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States 
under Sec. 395.32 shall accrue to each blind vendor operating a vending 
facility on such Federal property in each State in an amount not to 
exceed the average net income of the total number of blind vendors 
within such State, as determined each fiscal year on the basis of each 
prior year's operation, except that vending machine income shall not 
accrue to any blind vendor in any amount exceeding the average net 
income of the total number of blind vendors in the United States. No 
blind vendor shall receive less vending machine income than he was 
receiving during the calendar year prior to January 1, 1974, as a direct 
result of any limitation imposed on such income under this paragraph. No 
limitation shall be imposed on income from vending machines, combined to 
create a vending facility, when such facility is maintained, serviced, 
or operated by a blind vendor. Vending machine income disbursed by a 
property managing department, agency or instrumentality of the United 
States to a State licensing agency in excess of the amounts eligible to 
accrue to blind vendors in accordance with this paragraph shall be 
retained by the appropriate State licensing agency.
    (b) The State licensing agency shall disburse vending machine income 
to blind vendors within the State on at least a quarterly basis.
    (c) Vending machine income which is retained under paragraph (a) of 
this section by a State licensing agency shall be used by such agency 
for the establishment and maintenance of retirement or pension plans, 
for health insurance contributions, and for the provision of paid sick 
leave and vacation time for blind vendors in such State, if it is so 
determined by a majority vote of blind vendors licensed by the State 
licensing agency, after such agency has provided to each such vendor 
information on all matters relevant to such purposes. Any vending 
machine income not necessary for such purposes shall be used by the 
State licensing agency for the maintenance and replacement of equipment, 
the purchase of new equipment, management services, and assuring a fair 
minimum return to vendors. Any assessment charged to blind vendors by a 
State licensing agency shall be reduced pro rata in an amount equal to 
the total of such remaining vending machine income.


<R05>
Sec. 395.9  The setting aside of funds by the State licensing agency.

    (a) The State licensing agency shall establish in writing the extent 
to which funds are to be set aside or caused to be set aside from the 
net proceeds of the operation of the vending facilities and, to the 
extent applicable, from vending machine income under Sec. 395.8(c) in an 
amount determined by the Secretary to be reasonable.
    (b) Funds may be set aside under paragraph (a) of this section only 
for the purposes of:
    (1) Maintenance and replacement of equipment;
    (2) The purchase of new equipment;
    (3) Management services;
    (4) Assuring a fair minimum of return to vendors; or

[[Page 471]]

    (5) The establishment and maintenance of retirement or pension 
funds, health insurance contributions, and provision for paid sick leave 
and vacation time, if it is so determined by a majority vote of blind 
vendors licensed by the State licensing agency, after such agency 
provides to each such vendor information on all matters relevant to such 
proposed purposes.
    (c) The State licensing agency shall further set out the method of 
determining the charge for each of the above purposes listed in 
paragraph (b) of this section, which will be determined with the active 
participation of the State Committee of Blind Vendors and which will be 
designed to prevent, so far as is practicable, a greater charge for any 
purpose than is reasonably required for that purpose. The State 
licensing agency shall maintain adequate records to support the 
reasonableness of the charges for each of the purposes listed in this 
section, including any reserves necessary to assure that such purposes 
can be achieved on a consistent basis.


<R05>
Sec. 395.10  The maintenance and replacement of vending facility equipment.

    The State licensing agency shall maintain (or cause to be 
maintained) all vending facility equipment in good repair and in an 
attractive condition and shall replace or cause to be replaced worn-out 
and obsolete equipment as required to ensure the continued successful 
operation of the facility.


<R05>
Sec. 395.11  Training program for blind individuals.

    The State licensing agency shall ensure that effective programs of 
vocational and other training services, including personal and 
vocational adjustment, books, tools, and other training materials, shall 
be provided to blind individuals as vocational rehabilitation services 
under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Pub. L. 93-112), as amended by the 
Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1974 (Pub. L. 93-516). Such programs 
shall include on-the-job training in all aspects of vending facility 
operation for blind persons with the capacity to operate a vending 
facility, and upward mobility training (including further education and 
additional training or retraining for improved work opportunities) for 
all blind licensees. The State licensing agency shall further ensure 
that post-employment services shall be provided to blind vendors as 
vocational rehabilitation services as necessary to assure that the 
maximum vocational potential of such vendors is achieved and suitable 
employment is maintained within the State's vending facility program.


<R05>
Sec. 395.12  Access to program and financial information.

    Each blind vendor under this part shall be provided access to all 
financial data of the State licensing agency relevant to the operation 
of the State vending facility program, including quarterly and annual 
financial reports, provided that such disclosure does not violate 
applicable Federal or State laws pertaining to the disclosure of 
confidential information. Insofar as practicable, such data shall be 
made available in braille or recorded tape. At the request of a blind 
vendor State licensing agency staff shall arrange a convenient time to 
assist in the interpretation of such financial data.


<R05>
Sec. 395.13  Evidentiary hearings and arbitration of vendor complaints.

    (a) The State licensing agency shall specify in writing and maintain 
procedures whereby such agency affords an opportunity for a full 
evidentiary hearing to each blind vendor (which procedures shall also 
apply to cases under Sec. 395.6(e)) dissatisfied with any State 
licensing agency action arising from the operation or administration of 
the vending facility program. When such blind vendor is dissatisfied 
with any action taken or decision rendered as a result of such hearing, 
he may file a complaint with the Secretary. Such complaint shall be 
accompanied by all available supporting documents, including a statement 
of the decision which was rendered and the reasons in support thereof.
    (b) The filing of a complaint under paragraph (a) of this section 
with either the State licensing agency or the Secretary shall indicate 
consent by the blind vendor for the release of such information as is 
necessary for the conduct of a full evidentiary hearing or

[[Page 472]]

the hearing of an ad hoc arbitration panel.
    (c) Upon receipt of a complaint filed by a blind vendor which meets 
the requirements established by the Secretary, the Secretary shall 
convene an ad hoc arbitration panel which shall, in accordance with the 
provisions of 5 U.S.C. chapter 5, subchapter II, give notice, conduct a 
hearing, and render its decision which shall be final and binding on the 
parties except that such decision shall be subject to appeal and review 
as a final agency action for purposes of the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 
chapter 7.
    (d) The arbitration panel convened by the Secretary to hear the 
grievances of blind vendors shall be composed of three members appointed 
as follows:
    (1) One individual designated by the State licensing agency;
    (2) One individual designated by the blind vendor; and
    (3) One individual not employed by the State licensing agency or, 
where appropriate, its parent agency, who shall be jointly designated by 
the other members of the panel and who shall serve as chairman of the 
panel.
    (e) If either the State licensing agency or the blind vendor fails 
to designate a member of an arbitration panel, the Secretary shall 
designate such member on behalf of such party.
    (f) The decisions of an arbitration panel convened by the Secretary 
under this section shall be matters of public record and shall be 
published in the Federal Register.
    (g) The Secretary shall pay all reasonable costs of arbitration 
under this section in accordance with a schedule of fees and expenses 
which shall be published in the Federal Register.
    (h) The provisions of this section shall not require the 
participation of grantors of permits for the operation of vending 
facilities on property other than Federal property.


<R05>
Sec. 395.14  The State Committee of Blind Vendors.

    (a) The State licensing agency shall provide for the biennial 
election of a State Committee of Blind Vendors which, to the extent 
possible, shall be fully representative of all blind vendors in the 
State program on the basis of such factors as geography and vending 
facility type with a goal of providing for proportional representation 
of blind vendors on Federal property and blind vendors on other 
property. Participation by any blind vendor in any election shall not be 
conditioned upon the payment of dues or any other fees.
    (b) The State Committee of Blind Vendors shall:
    (1) Actively participate with the State licensing agency in major 
administrative decisions and policy and program development decisions 
affecting the overall administration of the State's vending facility 
program;
    (2) Receive and transmit to the State licensing agency grievances at 
the request of blind vendors and serve as advocates for such vendors in 
connection with such grievances;
    (3) Actively participate with the State licensing agency in the 
development and administration of a State system for the transfer and 
promotion of blind vendors;
    (4) Actively participate with the State licensing agency in the 
development of training and retraining programs for blind vendors; and
    (5) Sponsor, with the assistance of the State licensing agency, 
meetings and instructional conferences for blind vendors within the 
State.


<R05>
Sec. 395.15  Use of nominee agreements.

    (a) The State licensing agency may enter into an agreement whereby 
another agency or organization undertakes to furnish services to blind 
vendors. Such agreement shall be in writing and shall contain provisions 
which:
    (1) Clearly insure the retention by the State licensing agency of 
full responsibility for the administration and operation of all phases 
of the program;
    (2) Specify the type and extent of the services to be provided under 
such agreement;
    (3) Provide that no set-aside charges will be collected from blind 
vendors except as specified in such agreement;
    (4) Specify that no nominee will be allowed to exercise any function 
with respect to funds for the purchase of new equipment or for assuring 
a fair minimum of return to vendors, except to collect and hold solely 
for disposition in accordance with the order of

[[Page 473]]

the State licensing agency any charges authorized for those purposes by 
the licensing agency; and
    (5) Specify that only the State licensing agency shall have control 
with respect to selection, placement, transfer, financial participation 
and termination of the vendors, and the preservation, utilization, and 
disposition of program assets.
    (b) If the State licensing agency permits any agency or organization 
other than a vendor to hold any right, title to, or interest in vending 
facilities or stock, the arrangement shall be one permitted by State law 
and shall specify in writing that all such right, title to, or interest 
is held by such agency or organization as the nominee of the State 
licensing agency for program purposes and subject to the paramount right 
of the State licensing agency to direct and control the use, transfer, 
and disposition of such vending facilities or stock.


<R05>
Sec. 395.16  Permit for the establishment of vending facilities.

    Prior to the establishment of each vending facility, other than a 
cafeteria, the State licensing agency shall submit an application for a 
permit setting forth the location, the amount of space necessary for the 
operation of the vending facility; the type of facility and equipment, 
the number, location and type of vending machines and other terms and 
conditions desired to be included in the permit. Such application shall 
be submitted for the approval of the head of the Federal property 
managing department, agency, or instrumentality. When an application is 
not approved, the head of the Federal property managing department, 
agency, or instrumentality shall advise the State licensing agency in 
writing and shall indicate the reasons for the disapproval.


<R05>
Sec. 395.17  Suspension of designation as State licensing agency.

    (a) If the Secretary has reason to believe that, in the 
administration of the program, there is a failure on the part of any 
State licensing agency to comply substantially with the Act and this 
part, he shall so inform such agency in writing, setting forth, in 
detail, the areas in which there is such failure and giving it a 
reasonable opportunity to comply.
    (b) If, after the lapse of a reasonable time, the Secretary is of 
the opinion that such failure to comply still continues and that the 
State licensing agency is not taking the necessary steps to comply, he 
shall offer to such agency, by reasonable notice in writing thereto and 
to the chief executive of the State, an opportunity for a hearing before 
the Secretary (or person designated by the Secretary) to determine 
whether there is a failure on the part of such agency to comply 
substantially with the provisions of the Act and of this part.
    (c) If it is thereupon determined that there is a failure on the 
part of such agency to comply substantially with the Act and this part, 
appropriate written notice shall be given to such agency and to the 
chief executive of the State suspending such agency's designation as 
licensing agency effective 90 days from the date of such notice. A copy 
of such written notice shall be given to each department, agency, or 
instrumentality of the United States responsible for the maintenance, 
operation, and protection of Federal property on which vending machines 
subject to the requirements of Sec. 395.32 are located in the State. 
Upon the suspension of such designation, vending machine income from 
vending machines on Federal property due for accrual to the State 
licensing agency under Sec. 395.32 shall be retained in escrow by such 
department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States responsible 
for the maintenance, operation and protection of the Federal property on 
which such vending machines are located, pending redesignation of the 
State licensing agency or rescission of the suspension under paragraph 
(e) of this section.
    (d) If, before the expiration of such 90 days, the Secretary (or 
person designated by him) determines that the State licensing agency is 
taking the necessary steps to comply, he may postpone the effective date 
of such suspension for such time as he deems necessary in the best 
interest of the program.

[[Page 474]]

    (e) If, prior to the effective date of such suspension, the 
Secretary (or person designated by him) finds that there is no longer a 
failure on the part of the State licensing agency to comply 
substantially with the provisions of the Act and this part, he shall so 
notify the agency, the chief executive of the State, and each Federal 
department, agency, or instrumentality required to place funds in escrow 
under paragraph (c) of this section, in which event the suspension of 
the designation shall not become effective and the requirement to place 
funds in escrow shall be terminated.

                 Subpart C--Federal Property Management


<R05>
Sec. 395.30  The location and operation of vending facilities for blind vendors on Federal property.

    (a) Each department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States 
in control of the maintenance, operation, and protection of Federal 
property shall take all steps necessary to assure that, wherever 
feasible, in light of appropriate space and potential patronage, one or 
more vending facilities for operation by blind licensees shall be 
located on all Federal property Provided that the location or operation 
of such facility or facilities would not adversely affect the interests 
of the United States. Blind persons licensed by State licensing agencies 
shall be given priority in the operation of vending facilities on any 
Federal property.
    (b) Any limitation on the location or operation of a vending 
facility for blind vendors by a department, agency or instrumentality of 
the United States based on a finding that such location or operation or 
type of location or operation would adversely affect the interests of 
the United States shall be fully justified in writing to the Secretary 
who shall determine whether such limitation is warranted. A 
determination made by the Secretary concerning such limitation shall be 
binding on any department, agency, or instrumentality of the United 
States affected by such determination. The Secretary shall publish such 
determination in the Federal Register along with supporting documents 
directly relating to the determination.
    (c) Priority in the operation of vending facilities in areas 
administered by the National Park Service or the National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration shall be given to blind vendors. Priority in 
the awarding of contracts for the operation of concessions in such areas 
when such concessions provide accommodations, facilities, and services 
of a scope or of a character not generally available in vending 
facilities operated by blind vendors shall be given in accordance with 
the provisions of the Concession Policy Act (Pub. L. 98-249, 16 U.S.C. 
1) or the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, as amended (Pub. 
L. 85-568, 42 U.S.C. 2473). The provisions of this part shall not apply 
when all accommodations, facilities, or services in such areas are 
operated by a single responsible concessioner.


<R05>
Sec. 395.31  Acquisition and occupation of Federal property.

    (a) Effective January 2, 1975, no department, agency, or 
instrumentality of the United States shall undertake to acquire by 
ownership, rent, or lease, or to otherwise occupy, in whole or in part, 
any building unless it is determined that such building includes a 
satisfactory site or sites for the location and operation of a vending 
facility by a blind vendor. In those cases where a purchase contract, an 
agreement to lease, or other similar commitment was entered into prior 
to January 2, 1975, the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply.
    (b) Effective January 2, 1975, no department, agency, or 
instrumentality of the United States, shall undertake to occupy, in 
whole or in part, any building which is to be constructed, substantially 
altered, or renovated, or in the case of a building which is occupied on 
January 2, 1975 by a department, agency, or instrumentality of the 
United States, no such department, agency, or instrumentality shall 
undertake to substantially alter or renovate such building, unless it is 
determined that the design for such construction, substantial 
alteration, or renovation includes a satisfactory site or sites for the 
location and operation of a vending

[[Page 475]]

facility by a blind vendor. In those cases where a design contract or 
other similar commitment was entered into prior to January 2, 1975, the 
provisions of this paragraph shall not apply. For purposes of this 
paragraph, substantial alteration or renovation of a building means a 
permanent material change in the floor area of such building which would 
render such building appropriate for the location and operation of a 
vending facility by a blind vendor.
    (c) The determination that a building contains a satisfactory site 
or sites under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section shall be made after 
consultation between the State licensing agency and the head of the 
department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States which is 
planning to acquire or otherwise occupy such building. In order to make 
such determination, effective on the publication date of this part each 
such department, agency, or instrumentality shall provide to the 
appropriate State licensing agency written notice of its intention to 
acquire or otherwise occupy such building. Such written notice shall be 
by certified or registered mail with return receipt and shall be 
provided as early as practicable but no later than 60 days prior to such 
intended action. The written notice shall indicate that a satisfactory 
site or sites for the location and operation of a vending facility by 
blind persons is included in the plans for the building to be acquired 
or otherwise occupied and shall further assure that the State licensing 
agency shall be afforded the opportunity to determine whether such 
building includes a satisfactory site or sites for a vending facility. 
The written notice shall further assure that the State licensing agency, 
subject to the approval of the head of the Federal property managing 
department, agency, or instrumentality, shall be offered the opportunity 
to select the location and type of vending facility to be operated by a 
blind vendor prior to the completion of the final space layout of the 
building. The receipt of such written notice shall be acknowledged in 
writing promptly by the State licensing agency but no later than within 
30 days and the State licensing agency shall indicate at that time 
whether it is interested in establishing a vending facility. A copy of 
the written notice to the State licensing agency and the State licensing 
agency's acknowledgement shall be provided to the Secretary.
    (d) When, after a written notice has been provided under paragraph 
(c) of this section, the State licensing agency determines that the 
number of persons using the Federal property is or will be insufficient 
to support a vending facility, and the Secretary concurs with such 
determination, the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section 
shall not apply. The provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section shall also not apply when fewer than 100 Federal Government 
employees are or will be located during normal working hours in the 
building to be acquired or otherwise occupied or when such building 
contains less than 15,000 square feet of interior space to be utilized 
for Federal Government purposes in the case of buildings in which 
services are to be provided to the public.
    (e) The operation of a vending facility established under pre-
existing arrangements shall not be affected by the provisions of this 
section. The provisions of this section shall further not preclude 
future arrangements under which vending facilities to be operated by 
blind vendors may be established in buildings of a size or with an 
employee population less than that specified in paragraph (d) of this 
section: Provided, That both the State licensing agency and the Federal 
property managing department, agency or instrumentality concur in such 
establishment.
    (f) Each department, agency, and instrumentality of the United 
States, when leasing property in privately owned buildings, shall make 
every effort to lease property capable of accommodating a vending 
facility. When, however, such department, agency, or instrumentality is 
leasing part of a privately owned building in which prior to the 
execution of the lease, the lessor or any of his tenants had in 
operation or had entered into a contract for the operation of a 
restaurant or other food facility in a part of the building not included 
in such lease and the operation of a vending facility by a blind vendor 
would be in proximate and substantial

[[Page 476]]

direct competition with such restaurant or other food facility, the 
provisions of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section shall not 
apply.


<R05>
Sec. 395.32  Collection and distribution of vending machine income from vending machines on Federal property.

    (a) The on-site official responsible for the Federal property of 
each property managing department, agency, or instrumentality of the

such blind vendor operating such vending facility on such property 
provided that the total amount of such income accruing to such blind 
vendor does not exceed the maximum amount determined under 
Sec. 395.8(a). In the event that there is income from such vending 
machines in excess of the maximum amount which may be disbursed to the 
blind vendor under Sec. 395.8(a), such additional income shall accrue to 
the State licensing agency for purposes determined in accordance with 
Sec. 395.8(c).
    (c) Effective January 2, 1975, 50 per centum of all vending machine 
income from vending machines on Federal property which are not in direct 
competition with a vending facility operated by a blind vendor shall 
accrue to the State licensing agency which shall disburse such income to 
the blind vendor operating such vending facility on such property. In 
the event that there is no blind vendor, such income shall accrue to the 
State licensing agency, except as indicated under paragraph (d) of this 
section. The total amount of such income disbursed to such blind vendor 
shall not exceed the maximum amount determined under Sec. 395.8(a). In 
the event that there is income from such vending machines in excess of 
the maximum amount which may accrue to the blind vendor under 
Sec. 395.8(a), such additional income shall accrue to the State 
licensing agency for purposes determined in accordance with 
Sec. 395.8(c).
    (d) Effective January 2, 1975, 30 per centum of all vending machine 
income from vending machines, which are not in direct competition with a 
vending facility operated by a blind vendor and which are on Federal

the premises occurs during a period other than normal working hours, 
shall accrue to the State licensing agency which shall disburse such 
income to the blind vendor operating a vending facility on such 
property. In the event that there is no blind vendor on such property, 
such income shall accrue to the State licensing agency. The total amount 
of such income disbursed to such blind vendor shall not exceed the 
maximum amount determined under Sec. 395.8(a). In the event that there 
is income from such vending machines in excess of the maximum amount 
which may be disbursed to the blind vendor under Sec. 395.8(a), such 
additional income shall accrue to the State licensing agency for 
purposes determined in accordance with Sec. 395.8(c).
    (e) The determination that a vending machine on Federal property is 
in direct competition with a vending facility operated by a blind vendor 
shall be the responsibility of the on-site official responsible for the 
Federal property of each property managing department, agency or 
instrumentality of the United States, subject to the concurrence of the 
State licensing agency.
    (f) In the case of vending machine income which, prior to the 
effective date of this part, has been disbursed to a blind vendor by a 
property managing department, agency, or instrumentality from proceeds 
which accrued from operations subsequent to January 2, 1975, pursuant to 
agreements in effect prior to such time, such income may be deducted, at 
the discretion of such property managing department, agency

[[Page 477]]

or instrumentality, from vending machine income due to the State 
licensing agency under paragraphs (b), (c), or (d) of this section.
    (g) The collection of vending machine income and its disbursement to

Sec. 395.33  Operation of cafeterias by blind vendors.

    (a) Priority in the operation of cafeterias by blind vendors on 
Federal property shall be afforded when the Secretary determines, on an 
individual basis, and after consultation with the appropriate property 
managing department, agency, or instrumentality, that such operation can 
be provided at a reasonable cost, with food of a high quality comparable 
to that currently provided employees, whether by contract or otherwise. 
Such operation shall be expected to provide maximum employment 
opportunities to blind vendors to the greatest extent possible.
    (b) In order to establish the ability of blind vendors to operate a 
cafeteria in such a manner as to provide food service at comparable cost 
and of comparable high quality as that available from other providers of 
cafeteria services, the appropriate State licensing agency shall be 
invited to respond to solicitations for offers when a cafeteria contract 
is contemplated by the appropriate property managing department, agency, 
or instrumentality. Such solicitations for offers shall establish 
criteria under which all responses will be judged. Such criteria may 
include sanitation practices, personnel, staffing, menu pricing and 
portion sizes, menu variety, budget and accounting practices. If the 
proposal received from the State licensing agency is judged to be within 
a competitive range and has been ranked among those proposals which have 
a reasonable chance of being selected for final award, the property 
managing department, agency, or instrumentality shall consult with the 
Secretary as required under paragraph (a) of this section. If the State 
licensing agency is dissatisfied with an action taken relative to its 
proposal, it may file a complaint with the Secretary under the 
provisions of Sec. 395.37.
    (c) All contracts or other existing arrangements pertaining to the 
operation of cafeterias on Federal property not covered by contract 
with, or by permits issued to, State licensing agencies shall be 
renegotiated subsequent to the effective date of this part on or before 
the expiration of such contracts or other arrangements pursuant to the 
provisions of this section.
    (d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of 
this section, Federal property managing departments, agencies, and 
instrumentalities may afford priority in the operation of cafeterias by 
blind vendors on

[[Page 478]]

Federal property through direct negotiations with State licensing 
agencies whenever such department, agency, or instrumentality 
determines, on an individual basis, that such operation can be provided 
at a reasonable cost, with food of a high quality comparable to that 
currently provided employees: Provided, however, That the provisions of 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall apply in the event that the 
negotiations authorized by this paragraph do not result in a contract.


<R05>
Sec. 395.34  Application for permits.

discriminate against any person or persons in furnishing, or by refusing 
to furnish, to such person or persons the use of any vending facility, 
including any and all services, privileges, accommodations, and 
activities provided thereby, and comply with title VI of the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964 and regulations issued pursuant thereto.
    (b) The permit shall be issued for an indefinite period of time

vending facilities and vending machines in an orderly condition at all 
times, and the installation, maintenance, repair, replacement, 
servicing, and removal of vending facility equipment shall be without 
cost to the department, agency, or instrumentality responsible for the 
maintenance of the Federal property; and
    (3) Articles sold at vending facilities operated by blind licensees 
may consist of newspapers, periodicals, publications, confections, 
tobacco products, foods, beverages, chances for any lottery authorized 
by State law and conducted by an agency of a State within such State, 
and other articles or services as are determined by the State licensing

that costs of relocations initiated by the State licensing agency shall 
be paid by the State licensing agency; and that costs of relocations 
initiated by the department, agency, or instrumentality shall be borne 
by such department, agency, or instrumentality.
    (f) The operation of a cafeteria by a blind vendor shall be covered 
by a contractual agreement and not by a permit.

    (b) Unresolved disagreements concerning the terms of the permit, the

department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States which has 
control of the maintenance, operation, and protection of Federal 
property is failing to comply with the provisions of the Act or of this 
part and all informal attempts to resolve the issues have been 
unsuccessful, such licensing agency may file a complaint with the 
Secretary.
    (b) Upon receipt of a complaint filed under paragraph (a) of this 
section, the Secretary shall convene an ad hoc arbitration panel which 
shall, in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. ch. 5, subchapter

be final and binding on the parties except that such decision shall be 
subject to appeal and review as a final agency action for purposes of 
the provisions of 5 U.S.C. ch. 7. The arbitration panel convened by the 
Secretary to hear complaints filed by a State licensing agency shall be 
composed of three members appointed as follows:
    (1) One individual designated by the State licensing agency;
    (2) One individual designated by the head of the Federal department, 
agency, or instrumentality controlling the Federal property over which 
the dispute arose; and
    (3) One individual, not employed by the Federal department, agency, 
or instrumentality controlling the Federal property over which the 
dispute arose, who shall be jointly designated by the other members of 
the panel and who shall serve as chairman of the panel.
    (c) If either the State licensing agency or the head of the Federal 
department, agency, or instrumentality fails to designate a member of an 
arbitration panel, the Secretary shall designate such member on behalf 
of such party.
    (d) If the panel finds that the acts or practices of any department, 
agency, or instrumentality are in violation of the Act or of this part, 
the head of any such department, agency, or instrumentality (subject to 
any appeal under paragraph (b) of this section) shall cause such acts or 
practices to be terminated promptly and shall take such other action as 
may be necessary to carry out the decision of the panel.
    (e) The decisions of an arbitration panel convened by the Secretary 
under this section shall be matters of public record and shall be 
published in the Federal Register.
    (f) The Secretary shall pay all reasonable costs of arbitration 
under this section in accordance with a schedule of fees and expenses 
which shall be published in the Federal Register.
